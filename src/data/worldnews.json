    "body": "13 hours agoGeorgina Rannard and BBC climate team,Belém, BrazilThe UN climate talks COP30 have been evacuated due to a fire breaking out inside the venue in Belém, Brazil.BBC journalists saw flames and smoke in the pavilion area before they were rushed outside where fire engines raced past.The UN said the fire was extinguished after six minutes and 13 people were treated for smoke inhalation. It is not yet known what caused the blaze. The talks were in the final hours of trying to agree on next steps to tackle climate change but the fire has disrupted negotiations and the talks remain closed.\"It was climbing the walls and onto the ceiling. People were screaming,\" Dr Harshita Umesh, who was giving a talk next to the place where they fire broke out, told BBC News.\"Then I ran, I think I tripped and fell.\"Dr Umesh, who is a medical doctor, said that ambulance staff told her that first responders inhaled \"toxic fumes\" and were given oxygen masks to the site.Emergency medicine specialist Kimberly Humphrey, currently helping patients at the COP medical centre, told the BBC that the injuries are \"Mainly people with smoke inhalation, someone with a lung injury from smoke.\"\"People are pretty traumatised and shocked,\" she added.\"There's a huge panic, people have been running out of here, it's a very dramatic moment... UN security guards are telling us to leave,\" said BBC Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt shortly after the fire broke out.\"You can see huge columns of smoke rising up into the air through the hole that's been burnt in the top of the conference centre,\" he said.BBC journalists saw two ambulances driving towards the entrance more than 90 minutes after the fire started.A Brazilian security officer putting a chain through the gates of the venue with a chain told the BBC the premises must be evacuated and locked. After the fire broke out, orange flames burned a hole through the sheeting that covers the venue, which is in a former aerodrome. One video shows a man spraying a fire extinguisher at the fire before running away.One eyewitness told the BBC that he believes an electrical fire was the cause.A woman was taken away in a wheelchair, but it is not clear if that was connected to the fire.Hundreds of people were left sitting on the floor or on plastic chairs outside in high temperatures and humidity. The fire is likely to delay the closing of a deal in the talks.A number of country delegations were forced to take shelter outside under the roof of a petrol station, a member of the UK delegation told the BBC. He said the fire halted negotiations.The UN, which runs COP climate meetings, said the fire brigade is checking the venue to assess safety and that the summit has been temporarily taken over by Brazilian authorities.Thousands of people are attending the UN climate talks, including members of delegations from around the world.Nearly 200 countries are trying to agree on how to make progress in tackling climate change.

    "body": "More than 250 people have been arrested in Charlotte, North Carolina, as part of President Donald Trump's escalating crackdown on undocumented immigration, US officials say. Charlotte is the latest US city that Trump has targeted with federal troops, following similar measures in bigger cities like Chicago and Los Angeles earlier this year. Officials with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) told the BBC that those arrested are criminals and gang members.But local lawmakers and residents have railed against the detainments, which the federal government has dubbed \"Operation Charlotte's Web\". The state's Democratic governor has alleged people are being targeted because of their race. In a statement released on Wednesday, a DHS spokesperson said the operation has led to the arrest of \"some of the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens\", including gang members. Others arrested had been convicted of a range of crimes, including assault on law enforcement, driving while intoxicated, theft and tampering with government documents, the department said earlier.North Carolina's Democratic Governor Josh Stein, who has denounced Trump's operations, accused agents of racially profiling residents. \"We've seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin colour, racially profiling and picking up random people in parking lots,\" Stein said on Sunday. \"This is not making us safer.\"The city's mayor, also a Democrat, urged federal agents to operate with \"respect\" for the city's values. She also commended those who came out in droves on Saturday to protest the Trump administration's actions in the city. \"I am deeply concerned with many of the videos I've seen,\" Mayor Vi Lyles said. \"To everyone in Charlotte who is feeling anxious or fearful: you are not alone. Your city stands with you.\" DHS has not said how long the raids will last. Chicago's crackdown started in September and is still ongoing. Like other cities subject to immigration crackdowns, some migrants in Charlotte are staying home for fear of federal agents in the city, according to local media reports.Stein says he's monitoring reports that the operation will come to Raleigh, another North Carolina city, next. \"Once again, I call on federal agents to target violent criminals, not neighbors walking down the street, going to church, or putting up Christmas decorations,\" he wrote.",

    "body": "6 hours agoLana LamSydneyGetty ImagesTwitch is the latest platform to be included in Australia's teen social media banTwitch, a streaming platform popular with gamers, has been added to Australia's  teen social media ban which starts next month.It joins other platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Tik Tok and Snapchat that must ensure under-16s cannot open accounts and existing ones are closed from 10 December.Australia's internet regulator overseeing the ban said Twitch - owned by Amazon -has been included as its main purpose was \"online social interaction\" where users were encouraged to chat to each other about posted content.A Twitch spokesperson said Australians under 16 will not be able to open a Twitch account from 10 December, and from 9 January, existing under-16s accounts will be deactivated.On her reasons why Twitch had been included, eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said it was \"a platform most commonly used for livestreaming or posting content that enables users, including Australian children, to interact with others in relation to the content posted\".No more platforms are expected to be added to the ban before the start date next month, Ms Inman Grant said. The government has previously said the ban is aimed at reducing the \"pressures and risks\" children can be exposed to on social media, including harmful content.Founded in 2007, Twitch is a popular livestreaming platform, where people typically play video games while chatting to viewers.Last year, it launched plans to share more of its revenue with creators as part of a shake-up, allowing streamers to make money through fans subscribing to their channel.The revenue is split equally between Twitch and the creator, after fees are paid.Twitch's policy forbids anyone under 13 to use its platform and users aged between 13 and the legal age of adulthood in their country can join if they have permission from their parent or guardian.Ms Inman Grant also said on Friday that Pinterest, where users compile online notice boards of images, would not be included in the ban because its core purpose was not about online social interaction.Instead, the platform was \"more commonly used by individuals collating images for inspiration and idea curation,\" she said.Australia's world-first under-16s social media ban also includes YouTube, Reddit, Kick, Threads and X.The ban means tech companies must take \"reasonable steps\" to stop under-16s from using their platforms or risk being fined up to $49.5m (US$32m, £25m).Earlier this week, Meta - which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads - announced it would start closing accounts of teenagers under 16 from 4 December, a week before the official ban. It's not clear how companies will enforce the ban but some possibilities included the use of government IDs, face or voice recognition and age inference. The latter of these uses online information other than a date of birth - such as online behaviour or interactions - to estimate a person's age.",

    "body": "5 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterA surrealist painting from the 1940s by Frida Kahlo has sold for $54.7m (£41.8m) - shattering the auction record for an artwork by a female artist. The painting went for more than 1,000 times its original auction price in 1980, after a tense bidding battle between two collectors, according to the Sotheby's auction house.The auction also broke the previous record for the highest amount paid for a Kahlo portrait, which sold for $34.9 million in 2021.The work - titled El sueño (la cama), which is translated to The dream (The bed)  - depicts Kahlo asleep in a canopy bed beneath a skeleton entwined with dynamite.It marks one of the Mexican artist's most \"psychologically charged\" self portraits, Sotheby's said, and was painted during a turbulent chapter in Kahlo's life - the year her former lover was assassinated and shortly after her divorce and remarriage.Kahlo, who died in 1954, is widely regarded as one of the greatest painters in the past century and became known for her personal portraits.Her work often conveyed her painful relationship with her body, disabled through polio in her childhood and serious injuries following a bus accident.Few could have imagined El sueño (la cama) selling for $55m when it was first went under the hammer at Sotheby's in 1980 for $51,000, the auction house's head of Latin American art, Anna Di Stasi, said. \"This record-breaking result shows just how far we have come, not only in our appreciation of Frida Kahlo's genius, but in the recognition of women artists at the very highest level of the market,\" she added.El sueño (la cama) is one of the few Kahlo paintings in public markets since the Mexican authorities declared her artworks as artistic monuments in the 1980s, preventing them from being exported without authorisation.Kahlo's story was adapted into a biographical film starring Salma Hayek in 2002, telling her story of her rocky relationship with her husband, artist Diego Rivera, and her injuries.The previous highest price at auction for a work by a female artist is Georgia O'Keeffe's Jimson Weed / White Flower No.1, which was sold at Sotheby's in 2014 for $44m.

    "body": "One of the world's first calculating machines will not go to auction as scheduled in France, after a Paris court provisionally blocked the historic item from being exported.Auction house Christie's has confirmed it will not proceed with bidding for the machine La Pascaline, developed by the French mathematician Blaise Pascal in 1642.Valuations suggested the machine could fetch €2m to 3m (£1.7m to £2.6m), and Christie's called it the \"most important scientific instrument ever offered at auction\".Scientists and researchers made a legal appeal to grant heritage protections to the historic instrument, arguing it should be classified as a \"national treasure\".Pascal was just 19 years old when he developed the earliest version of a calculator, Christie's said. There are only nine of these machines still in existence.\"It is the first attempt in history to substitute the human mind with a machine,\" the official collection description reads.\"Its invention marks a breakthrough, a 'quantum leap' whose importance and significance take on a very special meaning today.\"La Pascaline was exhibited at Christie's venues in New York and Hong Kong throughout the year. The machine was included in Christie's auction of the library of the late Catalonia collector Léon Parcé, which also featured Pascal's philosophical piece Pensées and the first printed version of \"Pascal's wager\".On Wednesday, a Paris administrative court temporarily blocked an earlier export authorisation provided by France's culture minister in May. Two experts had signed off on the minister's certificate, including one from the Louvre Museum.The judge concluded there were \"serious doubts\" over the legality of the certificate, a statement from the Paris court said, adding the decision was provisional until a final judgment is delivered.In a statement to the AFP news agency, a Christie's spokesperson said: \"Given the provisional nature of this decision and in accordance with the instructions of its client, Christie's is suspending the sale of La Pascaline.\" The court noted La Pascaline's historic and scientific value could qualify it as a \"national treasure\", guaranteeing protections under France's heritage code.The French heritage group Association Sites & Monuments, which was listed as an applicant in the court filing, welcomed the decision.Additional reporting by Sebastian Usher, Global Affairs reporter",

Their words cannot be allowed to stand. SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!! LOCK THEM UP???,\" Trump wrote on social media.The six lawmakers, all of whom have served in the military or intelligence community, called Trump's remarks dangerous and said they amounted to threats against elected officials.\"No threat, intimidation, or call for violence will deter us from that sacred obligation,\" they said in a joint statement.The video by Democrats, which was shared by Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin, features Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Representatives Chris DeLuzio of Pennsylvania, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania and Jason Crow of Colorado.Sen Kelly, who served in the Navy and is a former astronaut, says: \"Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders.\"\"No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our constitution,\" the lawmakers say in the video.\"This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens,\" it says. \"Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this Constitution. Right now, the threats coming to our Constitution aren't just coming from abroad but from right here at home.\"The response from Trump on Thursday morning came in a series of posts on Truth Social. \"It's called SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.

LOCK THEM UP???\"In a third post, he wrote: \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\"Trump also reposted a TruthSocial post that read \"HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!\"At a press briefing on Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected suggestions that Trump was calling for the execution of members of Congress.\"Many in this room want to talk about the president's response, but not what brought the president to responding in this way,\" she said, accusing the lawmakers of encouraging military personnel to defy \"lawful orders\".Heightened concern over US political rhetoricLeavitt quickly responded \"no\" when asked at a White House press briefing on Thursday afternoon whether Trump wants to \"execute\" members of Congress, saying the media should instead focus on the lawmakers' own comments.\"They are literally saying to 1.3 million active duty service members to defy the chain of command, not to follow lawful orders,\" Leavitt said at Thursday's press briefing. \"It perhaps is punishable by law,\" she added later.Leadership in the US House of Representatives have said they are working with Capitol Police to adequately protect the lawmakers - and their families - who are at the centre of Trumps' posts. Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries slammed Trump's remarks, saying the president must \"recant his violent rhetoric before he gets someone killed\".Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, however, defended the president, saying Trump was simply \"defining the crime of sedition\" calling the Democrats' video \"wildly inappropriate\" and \"very dangerous\".The Department of Justice and Pentagon will be reviewing the matter, he said.Trump's remarks come amid heightened concern about politically motivated attacks in the US.An October Pew Research Center study found 85% of Americans believe such violence is increasing, a trend echoed in a November Politico and Public First poll.Trump, himself, was targeted in two alleged assassination attempts - one at a political rally during his presidential campaign last year that left one person dead. Trump and several others in attendance were injured.Just this year there have been a number of high-profile incidents, including the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, an arson attack on Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's home, and the killing of a Democratic Minnesota lawmaker and her husband. In the wake of Kirk's murder, many conservatives including Trump spoke out against Democrats and said they were responsible for the growing political violence in the US. Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene recently spoke out about the increased number of threats she's received since breaking with Trump on some policies. Their feud boiled over last week when Trump posted several times about her, calling her \"wacky\" and a \"traitor\". Her son also received a death threat, according to local police. More public officials are reporting swatting - making prank calls to emergency services to deploy a Special Weapons and Tactics team (Swat) - attempts in recent months. That includes an Indiana Republican who was the focus of a separate Truth Social attack from the president, over his stance on redistricting in the state. ",

    "body": "1 day agoRushdi Abualouf,Gaza correspondent, in Istanbul and David GrittenAt least 25 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, the Hamas-run health ministry has said, in what was one of the deadliest days since the ceasefire came into effect five weeks ago.Ten people were killed when a ministry of religious endowments building in the eastern Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City was hit, according to rescuers.Israel's military said it struck \"Hamas terrorist targets\" after gunmen opened fire towards an area where its soldiers were operating in the southern city of Khan Younis in violation of the ceasefire deal.Hamas questioned the claim and denounced what it said was a \"dangerous escalation\" that could jeopardise the ceasefire.The flare-up of violence comes after the UN Security Council passed a resolution that endorsed US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan to end two years of devastating war.Mahmoud Bassal, a spokesman for Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency, told the BBC that Israeli air, drone and artillery strikes hit several locations in Gaza City and Khan Younis shortly after sunset on Wednesday.The attacks marked a sharp escalation after several days of relative calm, he said.The Civil Defence reported that the strike in Zeitoun caused severe damage to the religious endowments ministry's building and surrounding structures, and posted a video showing its rescue workers appearing to find two people buried under rubble.Photos published by the Anadolu news agency meanwhile showed the bodies of three young children reportedly recovered from the scene.In a separate incident in Gaza City, one person was killed and several others were wounded when a drone struck a group of people at Shejaiya junction on Salah al-Din Street, Gaza's main north-south road, according to Mr Bassal.He said another person was killed when a tank shell struck a house belonging to the Balboul family in Shejaiya's Mushtaha Street, which is also in eastern Gaza City.The Civil Defence reported that another 13 people were killed in the Khan Younis area.Mr Bassal said three of them were killed in a strike on a group inside a sports club run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa).In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that \"several terrorists opened fire toward the area where IDF soldiers are operating in Khan Younis\" earlier on Wednesday.\"This action constitutes a violation of the ceasefire agreement. No IDF injuries were reported,\" it added. \"In response, the IDF began striking Hamas terrorist targets across the Gaza Strip.\"Israeli public broadcaster Kan cited a security source as saying the targets of the strikes were the commander of the Zeitoun Battalion of Hamas's military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, and the commander of its naval force.Hamas denounced the Israeli strikes, saying in a statement that it considered them a \"dangerous escalation through which the war criminal [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu seeks to resume the genocide against our people\".It also urged the US to \"honour its stated commitments and exert immediate pressure on Israel to enforce the ceasefire and halt its attacks\".But a US official told Reuters news agency that Hamas was aiming to break the ceasefire and not fulfil its commitment to disarm.On Monday, the UN Security Council passed a resolution that sought to shore up the fragile ceasefire, which took effect on 10 October.Member states authorised the creation of a transitional governance body called the Board of Peace, which will be chaired by President Trump, and a temporary International Stabilisation Force (ISF), which will be tasked with ensuring \"the process of demilitarizing the Gaza Strip\".Trump hailed the resolution as \"a moment of true historic proportion\".Hamas reiterated that it would not give up its weapons without a Palestinian state, arguing its fight against Israel was legitimate \"resistance\".Israel's ambassador to the UN stressed the importance of disarmament, saying that his country would \"not stop or let up\" until Hamas no longer presented \"a threat\".The Israeli military launched an offensive in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 69,500 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, including 280 during the ceasefire, according to the territory's health ministry.The Israeli military has said three of its soldiers have been killed in attacks in Gaza since the ceasefire began and that its has targeted scores of fighters.On Wednesday afternoon, Israel's military also carried out several strikes in southern Lebanon saying it targeted weapons storage facilities belonging to Hezbollah.Israel accuses the Iran-backed armed group of trying to rebuild its capabilities following a war that ended last November.",

    "body": "Raccoons may be inching closer to becoming America's next pet.Affectionately referred to as trash pandas, the masked mammals known for rummaging rubbish bins for easy food, are evolving based on their proximity to humans, even starting to look cuter, a new study says. Evaluation of nearly 20,000 photos found \"a clear reduction in snout length\" in urban raccoons compared to their rural cousins - a physical shift consistent with the early stages of domestication seen in cats and dogs.Some that have been adopted as pets have become TikTok celebrities. One particularly bold dumpster-diver even sprinted across the pitch during a Major League Soccer match in Philadelphia last year.The stripe-tailed mammals, also nicknamed \"backyard bandits\", are widespread across the contiguous US. Their ability to thrive in both wild and urban settings has left them occupying an unusual space in American life - beloved pet in some neighbourhoods, persistent pest in others.The proximity to humans could signal that the creatures are growing more comfortable around us, or, scientifically speaking, dampening their innate flight responses, according to the study published in the journal Frontiers in Zoology.The softening of their features could be due to shifts in their fight-or-flight response on the cellular level, it says.This urban domestication starts with trash, the study's co-author, Raffaela Lesch of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, told Scientific American.\"Trash is really the kickstarter,\" she said. \"Wherever humans go, there's trash — and animals love our trash.\"But to take advantage of this endless buffet, wildlife must strike a delicate balance: bold enough to root through bins and navigate human environments, yet not so bold as to pose a threat. \"If you have an animal that lives close to humans, you have to be well-behaved enough,\" Lesch said. \"That selection pressure is quite intense.\"The finding, the authors said, is consistent with the \"domestication syndrome phenotype\". Domestication syndrome - anatomical and morphological changes such as curly tails, floppy ears, depigmentation, smaller brains and reduced facial skeletons - are commonly cited as some of the most salient traits, the study says. Those traits are also seen among more common household pets, such as dogs that evolved from wolves.The study's authors also hypothesised that the domestication process is wrongly believed to be initiated by humans, who have captured or selectively bred animals in the past. The process might actually begin much earlier than previously thought, they said, notably when animals became habituated to human environments.\"Only animals with dampened flight (or fight) responses would succeed best,\" the authors wrote. \"This makes the initial stages of the domestication process a process of pure natural selection.\"",

    "body": "12 minutes agoLaura Gozzi and James ChaterRussia advances in Ukraine, but is there an end in sight?Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he is ready to work with the US on \"their vision\" for ending the war with Russia.Under the widely leaked plan, Kyiv would cede significant areas of the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine that it still controls, cut the size of its army, and pledge not to join Nato - proposals it has previously ruled out.The White House has pushed back on claims that Ukraine was not involved in the drafting of the plan, which emerged following meetings between US special envoy Steve Witkoff and and Russian counterpart Kirill Dmitriev.Provisions in the draft plan come across as heavily slanted towards Moscow - and it received a carefully diplomatic response from Kyiv. Ukraine has relied heavily on US military support since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, but President Donald Trump has shifted the US position so that further aid is funded by its Nato allies and securing a peace deal has become a priority.The draft Witkoff-Dmitriev plan emerged as Russia claimed small territorial gains in eastern Ukraine and Zelensky faced a domestic crisis implicating top officials in a $100m (£76) million corruption scandal.In his nightly address, the Ukrainian leader said US military officials in Kyiv had  \"presented its proposals, the points of a plan to end the war - their vision\".\"From the first days of the war, we have upheld one very simple position: Ukraine needs peace. A real peace - one that will not be broken by a third invasion.\"Kyiv and its European allies have long supported the idea of a \"just and lasting\" peace that would ensure no more of Ukraine is taken by Russia. Moscow has already annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula as well as four regions it partly occupies through the current, full-scale invasion.However, European leaders have been left out of the US-Russia plan and German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said from his perspective it was not yet a fully fledged plan but rather \"a list of topics and options\", citing remarks by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.The leaked draft proposes limiting Ukraine's military limited to 600,000 personnel, with European fighter jets stationed in neighbouring Poland.Kyiv would receive \"reliable security guarantees\", although details are not given. \"It is expected\" that Russia will not invade its neighbours and that Nato will not expand further.The draft also suggests Russia will be \"reintegrated into the global economy\", through the lifting of sanctions and by inviting Russia to rejoin the G7 group of the world's most powerful countries - making it the G8 again.Zelensky said he was set to speak to Trump in the coming days about the proposals, which also include plans for Ukraine to forgo many of its weapons.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected suggestions that the proposals would constitute major concessions from Ukraine - and that Ukraine had been frozen out, saying the US had engaged \"equally with both sides\".US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Secretary of State Rubio had been working on a proposal quietly for about a month, and had engaged both sides \"to understand what these countries would commit to in order to see a lasting and durable peace\", she said.\"It's a good plan for both,\" she added, without providing further details. \"We believe that it should be acceptable to both sides. And we're working very hard to get it done.\"An unnamed senior US official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that the plan \"was drawn up immediately following discussions with one of the most senior members of President Zelensky's administration, Rustem Umerov, who agreed to the majority of the plan, after making several modifications, and presented it to President Zelensky\". One Ukrainian MP told the BBC that Kyiv had not been involved in initial discussions, but brought in later on.Getty ImagesZelensky's office said the US believed the draft plan could \"help reinvigorate diplomacy\"Zelensky's office issued a carefully worded statement earlier on Thursday, saying the plan \"in the American side's assessment, could help reinvigorate diplomacy\".In August Trump came away from a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska empty-handed. The US president became increasingly frustrated with negotiations with Moscow,- culminating Trump imposing fresh sanctions on Russia's two biggest oil producers which come into force on Friday.Zelensky has been careful not to publicly criticise or reject the plan, saying he \"appreciated the efforts of President Trump and his team to return security to Europe\" – perhaps a way to keep the US president onside despite his administration's apparent soft approach to Russia.But he stressed that Ukraine needs a \"worthy peace,\" and that the \"dignity of the Ukrainian people\" must be respected. The statement came after a meeting in Kyiv on Thursday between Zelensky and senior US military figures, including US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, army chief of staff Gen Randy George and top US army commander in Europe Gen Chris Donahue.When asked if Europe was involved in the process of drafting the plan, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said: \"Not that I know of.\" She added: \"For any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans onboard.\"Ukraine's European allies have now had to take on much of the funding for Kyiv's military and financial aid, and countries including the UK and France have offered to provide forces to ensure any peace holds.Moscow, meanwhile, has downplayed the significance of the 28-point plan.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that, while there had been \"contacts\" with the US, there was \"no process that could be called 'consultations'\".Peskov warned that any peace deal would have to address the \"root causes of the conflict\" - a phrase Moscow has used as shorthand for a series of maximalist demands which, to Ukraine, are tantamount to surrender. Since starting his second term earlier this year, Trump has launched into various initiatives aimed at ending the war in Ukraine several visits by his envoy Witkoff to Moscow, and rounds of talks with Zelensky and other Western leaders. But as the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine nears, the two sides remain deeply at odds over how to end the conflict. While Ukraine has become adept at targeting Russian military infrastructure and energy facilities with long-range drones, Moscow's attacks on Ukrainian targets continue unabated. Late on Thursday, a Russian attack on the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia killed at least five people, according to the regional governor. Hours later, Russia's defence ministry said it had intercepted and destroyed 33 Ukrainian drones over several Russian regions.Earlier this week, at least 26 people were killed in a Russian missile and drone attack on blocks of flats in Ukraine's western city of Ternopil. Another 17 people were still missing at the site on Thursday, Zelensky said.More on this story",

    "body": "Spain's Attorney General, Álvaro García Ortiz, has been forced to step down after being found guilty of revealing confidential information in a deeply controversial case, which accentuated the country's political division.The Supreme Court found that García Ortiz had unlawfully revealed details of the tax status of businessman Alberto González Amador, boyfriend of a senior conservative politician. The court handed him a two-year ban from the post and a fine of €7,200 (£6,438). He must also pay €10,000 to Mr González Amador as compensation.The trial of García Ortiz fuelled already acrimonious relations between the left-wing government of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and right-wing opposition.Their contrasting positions were underlined by reactions to the conviction.\"Sánchez must apologise to Spaniards, resign and call elections, in that order,\" said Ester Muñoz, spokeswoman for the conservative People's Party.The government said it did not agree with the ruling but respected it and would proceed with the appointment of a new attorney general.However, a number of politicians on the left expressed outrage at what they saw as a politically motivated ruling.Health Minister Mónica García, of the Sumar party, said the conviction dealt a \"lethal blow to [the concept of] presumption of innocence\" and threw ordinary Spaniards \"under the bus\" when it came to the rule of law.The complex case dates back to March 2024, when the attorney general's office issued a press release stating that Mr González Amador had requested a plea bargain after being found to have evaded tax payments worth €350,951. The document corrected mistaken press reports stating that the attorney general's office had proposed the bargain.The source of the incorrect reports was the head of communications of the conservative regional president of Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso. Ms Díaz Ayuso is the partner of Mr González Amador.Mr González Amador filed a complaint against the attorney general, claiming his privacy had been breached. The case against García Ortiz also saw him accused of leaking information about the affair to the media. Prosecutors pointed to the attorney general's decision to change his phone as incriminating.However, there was no direct evidence linking García Ortiz to the leak and several journalists testified during the trial that he had not been the source of their information. Regarding the press statement, the attorney general said he was simply correcting the erroneous reports.García Ortiz can appeal against the ruling.This comes as a severe blow for the prime minister, who has been under judicial pressure on various fronts. His brother is due to go on trial for influence peddling, his wife is under investigation for her business activities and two former senior figures in the Socialist Party, José Luis Ábalos and Santos Cerdán, are accused of overseeing a massive kickback scheme.",

    "body": "Trump signs bill ordering US justice department to release Epstein files10 hours agoSakshi Venkatraman and David Willis,North America correspondentWatch: \"I'm all for it\", Trump says on calls to release Epstein filesUS President Donald Trump says he signed a bill that orders the release of government files on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein - a significant turning point in a months-long fight over the documents.The justice department now has 30 days to publicly share all information from federal investigations into Epstein. However, it can withhold files that relate to active criminal investigations or are deemed to invade personal privacy.In a major reversal, Trump dropped his opposition to the measure last weekend,  after pushback from Epstein's victims and members of his own Republican Party.With his support, the resolution overwhelmingly cleared both chambers of Congress.Until recently, Trump had dismissed the need to release the documents, calling it a Democrat-led \"hoax\" to \"deflect\" attention away from his party's work. That position was itself a change from the stance he took ahead of the 2024 election.\"Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" he wrote.Although a congressional vote was not required to release the files - Trump could have ordered the release on his own - lawmakers in the House passed the legislation with a 427-1 vote. The Senate gave unanimous consent to pass it upon its arrival, sending the bill to Trump for his signature. The lone vote against the resolution in the House, the lower chamber, was cast by Louisiana Republican Clay Higgins, who objected to the scope of information that could be released. He said it could reveal and threaten \"thousands of innocent people\" who may have talked to investigators about allegations against Epstein.Under the law now signed by Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi must release the documents within 30 days.The files subject to release are from criminal investigations into Epstein, including transcripts of interviews with victims and witnesses, and items seized in raids of his properties. Those materials include internal justice department communications, flight logs, and people and entities connected to the late financier.But there are exceptions.The resolution allows the justice department to withhold any documents related to criminal investigations. After the estate documents were released last week, Trump said he would ask Bondi to investigate Epstein's ties to people who had apparently communicated with him. Bondi promptly said the justice department \"will pursue this with urgency and integrity\".One of the bill's architects, Republican Congressman Thomas Massie, said he had worries that the move would lead to some federal files being withheld.\"I'm concerned that [Trump is] opening a flurry of investigations, and I believe they may be trying to use those investigations as a predicate for not releasing the files. That's my concern,\" he said.Bondi can also withhold information that may identify victims or reveal their medical files, leading many to speculate that parts of the files will be redacted - although it remains unclear how heavy the redacting could be.\"I'm glad in the act itself they put specific language reinforcing the privacy rights of the victims here,\" said Christine Dunn, an attorney with Sanford Heisler Sharp McKnight who specialises in sexual violence and victims' rights.\"It's important to make sure that their privacy is protected and to avoid retraumatizing these victims,\" she said.White House: Epstein story 'a manufactured hoax'Trump had promised during his 2024 presidential campaign to make the files public, and early in the year his administration released thousands of pages of documents from the Epstein investigation, mostly flight logs. While Trump said more documents were coming, Bondi later announced in July there would be no further releases.That prompted lawmakers from both parties to introduce the resolution compelling the files' release. One of the resolution's key proponents was Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of Trump's fiercest political allies. She has publicly fought with Trump in recent weeks, as the US president maintained his opposition to the resolution up to a few days before the vote.After the resolution passed, Greene posted to say that she would read the name of any powerful person implicated in any released files aloud on the House floor.The anticipated files are different to the more than 20,000 pages of documents from Epstein's estate released by Congress last week, including some that mention Trump.Those include 2018 messages from Epstein in which he said of Trump: \"I am the one able to take him down\" and \"I know how dirty donald is\".Trump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.Speaking to reporters on Monday night, Trump said Republicans had \"nothing to do with Epstein\".\"It's really a Democrat problem,\" he said. \"The Democrats were Epstein's friends, all of them.\"The family of Virginia Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year, said in a statement Trump signing the bill was \"nothing short of monumental\", for Giuffre and other survivors. \"As we look towards the next chapter, we remain vigilant. This work is not finished. Every name must be revealed, regardless of power, wealth, or party affiliation,\" her brother and sister-in-law, Sky and Amanda Roberts, said.Epstein was found dead in 2019 in his New York prison cell in what a coroner ruled was a suicide. He was being held on charges of sex trafficking. He had been convicted previously of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008.The once high-flying financier had ties with a number of high-profile figures, including Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, the brother of King Charles and former prince; Trump; Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon; and a cast of other characters from the world of media, politics and entertainment.On Wednesday, former Harvard president Larry Summers took a leave from teaching at the university while the school investigated his links to Epstein, revealed in a series of chummy email exchanges.

    "body": "16 hours agoMansur AbubakarAbujaReutersKanu was not in court when the verdict was delivered, after being removed for unruly behaviourA court in Nigeria has found separatist leader Nnamdi Kanu guilty of terrorism and other charges following a decade-long legal case full of drama.He has been given four life sentences, along with other terms, to be served concurrently. The prosecution had called for the death penalty but Judge James Omotosho said that executions were now \"frowned upon\".In his ruling he said he was satisfied that Kanu had made a series of broadcasts to incite violence and killings, as part of his campaign for a separate state in south-east Nigeria, known as Biafra.Kanu was convicted on all seven charges he faced. As well as terrorism, they included treason and involvement with an outlawed movement.Kanu always denied the charges and challenged the court's jurisdiction. At the start of the trial he sacked his lawyers but refused to defend himself.He was not in court when the verdict was delivered, after being removed for unruly behaviour.Security around the courthouse in the capital, Abuja, was tightened ahead of the verdict in case of protests by Kanu's supporters.Once a relatively obscure figure, he came to national prominence in 2009 when he started Radio Biafra, a station that called for an independent state for the Igbo people, broadcast to Nigeria from London.Though he grew up in south-eastern Nigeria, where he attended the University of Nsukka, Kanu moved to the UK before graduating, and acquired British nationality.In 2014, he set up the Indigenous People Of Biafra (Ipob), a movement demanding independence.Ipob was banned as a terrorist organisation in 2017. Its armed wing - the Eastern Security Network - has been accused of killings and other acts of violence in recent years.Delivering his judgement, Justice Omotosho said: \"Mr Kanu knew what he was doing, he was bent on carrying out these threats without consideration to his own people.\"From the incontroverted evidence, it is clear that the defendant carried out preparatory act of terrorism.\"He had the duty to explain himself but failed to do so.\"Kanu is a popular figure in his movement's heartland in south-eastern Nigeria, but reaction to the verdict there has so far been muted.In court ahead of the ruling, Kanu insisted that proceedings could not continue because he had not yet filed his final written address, accusing the judge of bias and not understanding the law.The judgement was delivered after Kanu had been forcibly removed from the courtroom for unruly behaviour.Getty ImagesNnamdi Kanu has a global network of supporters - this group had gathered in London earlier this month to demand his freedomHe was first arrested in October 2015 but he jumped bail in 2017 and left the country after a military raid on his home. The court later revoked his bail in March 2019.Two years later, the government announced that he had been re-arrested. His lawyers say he was detained in Kenya and forcibly returned to Nigeria. Kenya has not commented.In 2022, an appeal court ordered that the charges against him be dropped, saying he had been illegally arrested abroad, but this ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court the following year.The calls for Biafran independence date back many years. In 1967 Igbo leaders declared a Biafran state, but after a brutal civil war, which led to the deaths of up to a million people, the secessionist rebellion was defeated.Many Igbo people continue to feel that they are marginalised by the Nigerian state however, it is not clear how many are in favour of independence.Additional reporting from BBC Igbo's Ebere Ekeopara in EnuguMore about Nigeria from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "An alert sent on Thursday warning of a strong earthquake in northern Nevada was issued in error, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS).At 08:06 local time, the USGS reported that a magnitude 5.9 earthquake had struck near Carson City, the state capital. The alert reached people nearly 200 miles away in the San Francisco Bay Area, triggering automatic warnings advising residents to drop for cover.However, the agency then cancelled the alert minutes later and removed the corresponding entry from its website.\"There was no M5.9 earthquake near Carson City, NV,\" the USGS said on X.The USGS said the alert originated from its automatic earthquake detection system, which had erroneously generated the report. It said it was believed to be the first time the agency has issued a completely false earthquake notification.An investigation is under way to determine what caused the malfunction.Multiple law enforcement agencies in cities and counties near the reported epicentre confirmed the absence of any ground movement.A magnitude 5.9 earthquake is typically strong enough to cause noticeable shaking and slight property damage, according to the Michigan Tech Earthquake Magnitude Scale.",

    "body": "A diamond-studded locket swallowed by a New Zealand man who tried to steal it has been \"recovered\", police say.The Fabergé egg locket, valued at NZ$33,585 ($19,300; £14,600), was recovered in a \"natural\" manner. \"Medical intervention [was] not required,\" they told the BBC.This comes about a week after police arrested the 32-year-old man at Partridge Jewellers in central Auckland, minutes after he allegedly ate the locket.The ingested loot is set with 60 white diamonds and 15 blue sapphires, according to the jeweller's website, and opens to reveal an 18-carat gold miniature octopus.The man has been charged with theft.Earlier this week, New Zealand police said the man had undergone a medical assessment and is constantly being monitored.\"Given this man is in police custody, we have a duty of care to continue monitoring him given the circumstances of what has occurred,\" police said then.The Octopussy egg, as it is named, was inspired by the 1983 James Bond film of the same name, which centres on an elaborate Fabergé egg heist.Fabergé is a world-renowned jeweller founded in Russia more than two centuries ago, famous for its eggs made of gems and precious metals.Partridge Jewellers said the locket will be returned to Fabergé, Radio NZ reported.The suspect is due to appear in court again on 8 December.According to charge sheets seen by the BBC, he has also been charged with allegedly stealing an iPad from the same jewellery store on 12 November and making away with cat litter and flea control products worth NZ$100 from a private address a day after.",

    "body": "The Israeli military has carried out a new round of air strikes in southern Lebanon, less than a day after Israel and Lebanon held their first direct talks in decades.Residents of the towns of Mjadel, Baraachit, Jbaa and Mahrouna were told to evacuate areas around locations that the Israeli military alleged were weapons warehouses belonging to the Iranian-backed group. No casualties have been reported.An Israeli military spokesman said the sites constituted a ceasefire violation and warned that it would continue to operate \"to remove any threat\" to Israel. Israel has carried out near-daily strikes on Lebanon since a ceasefire took effect in November 2024, following 13 months of conflict.There was no immediate comment from Lebanon's leaders in response to Thursday's strikes. Lebanese politicians have previously condemned similar strikes as ceasefire violations.Under the first phase of a deal brokered by the US and France, Israeli troops were to withdraw from southern Lebanon, while Hezbollah was to remove its fighters and weapons from south of the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) from the border with Israel - a plan the group and its allies oppose.Israel has maintained positions at several strategic border sites and stepped up its air strikes in recent weeks. It is an escalation officials say is driven by Hezbollah's attempts to rebuild its military infrastructure and what they see as limited Lebanese government efforts to disarm the group.Thursday's strikes came less than 24 hours after Israel and Lebanon sent civilian envoys to the Lebanese border town of Naqoura for their first direct talks in decades.The talks, hosted at the headquarters of the UN peacekeeping mission, Unifil, took place during a meeting of the ceasefire monitoring committee, which until now had only included military officers from the US, France, Lebanon, Israel and Unifil.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying the meeting \"took place in a good atmosphere\" and that it \"was agreed that ideas would be formulated to advance possible economic cooperation between Israel and Lebanon\".It also said that Israeli envoys \"clarified that the disarmament of Hezbollah is obligatory, regardless of the advancement of economic co-operation\".Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam was more cautious, saying Lebanon remained \"far\" from diplomatic normalisation with Israel and that the talks were focused on \"defusing tension\".\"We are not yet at peace talks,\" he told reporters, saying Lebanon's priorities were the cessation of hostilities, the release of Lebanese detainees held by Israel, and Israel's full withdrawal from its territory.He added that Beirut was open to the deployment of French and US troops to help verify efforts to disarm Hezbollah.The latest strikes and diplomatic moves coincide with a visit by a UN Security Council delegation to Lebanon to review the stalled implementation of the ceasefire.",

    "body": "2 days agoSteve RosenbergBBC Russia editorWhat does the latest round of diplomacy on Ukraine tell us about Russian President Vladimir Putin's mood and intentions?For starters, that he's not ready to sign a peace deal. At least, not right now.And certainly not the deal (or deals) on the table.\"No compromise version has yet been found,\" commented Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov after five hours of talks in Moscow involving Putin, US envoy Steve Witkoff, and Donald Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner.No compromise is no real surprise, considering the Kremlin leader's uncompromising comments in recent days. In various statements he has condemned the Ukrainian leadership as a \"thieving junta\", accused European leaders of trying to sabotage peace efforts, and insisted that Russia holds the initiative on the battlefield.On a couple of recent occasions Russian TV showed Putin in military fatigues, studying maps of the front line and trumpeting military gains, many of which Ukraine and international observers have denied.After nearly four years of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, despite the heavy losses Russia has suffered on the battlefield and the damage to the Russian economy, President Putin seems convinced that he is winning this war and that now is not the moment to stop.At least, that is what he would like the West to believe: that nothing can stop him now from achieving his goals.I've said before that, in many ways, Vladimir Putin reminds me of a car with no brakes, no steering wheel and no reverse gear; a vehicle careering full speed down the motorway.Nearly four years after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine there is still no sign of the \"Putinmobile\" turning off, turning back, or coming to a halt.He certainly wants his opponents to think that nothing or no one can force him to change direction: neither European leaders, nor the Trump administration, nor President Zelensky.But cars need fuel (a constant supply).And, to fight a war, countries need money (a constant supply).For now, despite international sanctions, Russia's government is still able to finance the \"special military operation\" - its war on Ukraine. But economic pressures are building: revenues from oil and gas have been falling, the budget deficit growing.Even Putin admits there are problems, referring to \"imbalances\" in the economy.\"In several sectors, production output not only failed to increase this year but actually decreased,\" Putin said this week. \"Are we satisfied with such trends? No.\"The big unknown: at what point, if at all, will economic concerns start to influence the Kremlin's calculations on the battlefield?",

    "body": "1 hour agoRachel ClunBusiness reporterNetflix is closing in on a deal to buy the film and streaming businesses of Warner Bros Discovery, according to multiple reports.The streaming giant has emerged as the top bidder for Warner Bros ahead of rivals  Comcast and Paramount Skydance after offering $28 (£21) per share, according to several outlets including Reuters and the New York Times.Paramount made an initial bid to buy the whole company, including its cable networks such as CNN, for $24 a share in October which Warner Bros rejected before putting itself up for sale.Paramount's lawyers have questioned the \"fairness and adequacy\" of the sale process this week, in a letter seen by CNBC.Paramount submitted a renewed bid for closer to $27 a share on Thursday, CNN reported.Warner Bros owns franchises including Harry Potter and Game of Thrones, and the streaming service HBO Max.Netflix, Warner Bros and Paramount have been approached for comment.Emma Wall, chief investment strategist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the takeover battle was a \"drama for people who make drama\".Speaking to BBC's Today programme, she said it was key to note the difference between the Paramount and Netflix bids, pointing out that Paramount's bid included the parts of Warner Bros business that have been \"dragging on profitability\".\"Netflix bid is only for parts of the business, and those are the parts of the business that are doing well,\" she said.Ms Wall said Paramount had taken an unusual step of accusing Warner Bros of favouring Netflix in the process. Paramount also said the streaming platform's offer was not as good a deal for Warner Bros shareholders because it would require the break up of the business.\"You're sort of tainting your offer if you go into a spat,\" she said.According to CNBC, Paramount's lawyers accused Warner Bros of undertaking \"a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder\".Whichever company buys Warner Bros, Ms Wall said the US competition regulator was likely to get involved.\"Whether Netflix is successful in this part bit or indeed paramount comes back for more, this will create a global mega power in broadcast entertainment which the regulator will want to look at,\" she said.Tom Harrington, head of television at Enders Analysis, said it was hard to gauge whether the deal would win regulatory approval, but if it went through it would have a massive impact on cinema.\"Were it to go through it would reorient Hollywood, with a streamer acquiring a business much of which it is existentially the antithesis of - Netflix has always had some limited use for the cinema but generally its offering undermines it,\" he said.Mr Harrington said there was likely to be \"big reductions\" in television and film output from a merged entity, which would lead to resistance to the move from parts of Hollywood and relevant unions.\"HBO, the creative jewel, would be terribly exposed within Netflix, although it has survived difficult owners for a lot of its existence,\" he said.For consumers, Mr Harrington said a merger was likely to lead to higher costs.\"Netflix would get more expensive and even though HBO Max would be shuttered/become non-essential, the greater penetration of Netflix households would likely mean an increase in total overall subscription revenues.\"",

    "body": "The man accused of assassinating former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has apologised to the ex-leader's family for the first time.Tetsuya Yamagami, who earlier pleaded guilty to murder, told the court on Thursday that he felt \"deeply sorry\" towards Abe's widow, Akie.Yamagami used a homemade gun to shoot Abe during a political campaign event in the western city of Nara on 8 July 2022. He died in the hospital on the same day.Abe's death sent shockwaves around the world. He was known for his hawkish foreign policy and a signature economic strategy that popularly came to be known as \"Abenomics\".\"I have caused [the family] three and a half years of suffering... I have no excuse,\" Yamagami told the court on Thursday, according to local media.He reportedly told investigators he attacked Abe because he blamed the ex-prime minister for allegedly promoting the Unification Church, which Yamagami said had bankrupted his mother and the wider family.Yamagami's allegations prompted investigations into the Unification Church, which started in South Korea and is known for its mass weddings.In March this year, a Tokyo court ordered the church to disband - a ruling that the church said it would \"fight to the end\".The Unification Church has drawn controversy even before Abe's assassination, for teaching that marriage is central to spiritual salvation.Abe's grandfather Nobusuke Kishi, who was also Japan's prime minister, was known to have been close to the Unification Church because of its anti-communist nature. Abe himself had spoken at events related to the group.During a hearing last month, prosecutors read out a statement from Abe's widow in which she wrote: \"The sorrow of losing a husband will not be relieved.\"",

    "body": "15 hours agoAlice CuddySenior international reporterThe parents of the last dead hostage in Gaza have spoken to the BBC about their desperate wait for his body to be returned.Itzik and Talik Gvili insisted the Gaza peace deal could not progress until Hamas handed over the remains of their son Ran, a 24-year-old Israeli police officer also known as Rani.\"We really hope that all people in the world... want to end this situation and go to the second phase, so Hamas must bring Rani home,\" his mother Talik said, after Israel confirmed the body of Thai national Suthisak Rintalak had been returned on Wednesday.He and Ran were among 251 people taken hostage in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, when another 1,200 people were killed.Ran was killed while fighting Hamas gunmen in Kibbutz Alumim, and his body was subsequently taken to Gaza as a hostage, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).His parents said he was on medical leave with a broken shoulder at the time of the attacks but went to fight after seeing on television what was happening.\"He couldn't stay at home even though he was injured. He took my car and his uniform... and went to help in the fight against the terrorists,\" said his father Itzik.\"He saved Kibbutz Alumim... and he saved Israel, so Israel has to save him now and bring him back home,\" he added.While the couple have been told by Israeli officials that Ran was killed, they say they are still holding onto \"a little percent\" of hope \"that maybe he's alive, maybe he's survived\".\"We want closure,\" said Talik.Speaking during a visit to London, Ran's parents described their pain over the past 26 months, much of which they have spent campaigning for the return of all the living and dead hostages.Under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the final 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza, but it has taken weeks for the bodies of the dead hostages to be returned, often only one at a time.\"When Hamas bring one of the hostages home we don't know who it is, maybe it's Rani, maybe it's someone else… It's like roulette. You cannot imagine the fright and the hope and everything. Sometimes it's not a hostage\" at all, said Talik, referring to  several sets of remains handed over that have turned out to belong to dead Palestinians.\"My wish is that no mother will feel what I feel in the whole world. We are strong people, but what is inside, you cannot imagine… They stole my child and I can do nothing - just pray and come to visit people and beg for help.\"Talik said she had not slept for a full night since 7 October 2023.\"You feel that you have 5,000 kilos on your chest. We don't have night. We don't have day. We have nothing,\" she said.While they are now the only people in Israel waiting for a loved one to be returned from Gaza, they said the support around them has grown.\"All the families are together with us and all Israeli people are with us. It [the support] is bigger than before because all Israeli people are now focused on one thing - bring Ran home and then do the second phase [of the peace deal],\" said Talik.The couple said that after Ran's return, they hoped for lasting peace and for Hamas to be dismantled.\"We are very proud of Ran. He's a hero in Israel. Hamas made Ran a hero... We want him back and to try to sleep well and breathe well again.\"Earlier on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also described Ran as a \"hero of Israel\", saying he had \"eliminated 14 terrorists and did so with the utmost bravery\" before being killed in battle.\"We are determined to bring Ran back for a proper Jewish burial and we will spare no effort to do so,\" he vowed.Israel responded to the 7 October 2023 attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 70,120 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

Moscow controls some 85% of Donbas.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out ceding territory.Putin's comments come after Donald Trump said his negotiators discussing a US peace plan believed Russia's leader \"would like to end the war\" after Tuesday's talks in Moscow.Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff, who was in Moscow, was due to meet Ukraine's team in Florida.Trump said Tuesday's talks in the Kremlin were \"reasonably good\", adding it was too soon to say what would happen as \"it does take two to tango\".The Kremlin said on Friday that Moscow was awaiting a response from Washington following the meeting in Russia.\"We are now waiting for the reaction of our American colleagues to the discussion we had on Tuesday,\" Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov was quoted as saying by RIA.He added there were no plans for a call between Putin and Trump, and no date had been set for a new meeting with Witkoff.The original iteration of the US peace plan proposed to hand over areas of the Donbas still under Ukrainian control to the de facto control of Putin - but the Witkoff team presented a modified version in Moscow.In his India Today interview ahead of a state visit to Delhi, Putin said he had not seen the new version before his talks with Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law.\"That's why we had to go over every point, that's why it took so long,\" the Kremlin leader said.He also said Moscow disagreed with parts of the US plan.\"At times we said that yes, we can discuss this, but to that we can't agree,\" Putin said.He did not name the sticking points. At least two significant points of contention remain - the fate of Ukrainian territory seized by Russian forces and security guarantees for Ukraine.Putin's senior foreign policy adviser and key negotiator Yuri Ushakov earlier said straight after the talks that they produced \"no compromise\" on ending the war.Ushakov also implied that the Russian negotiating position had been strengthened thanks to what Moscow said were its recent successes on the battlefield.Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of stalling any ceasefire agreements, saying Moscow is seeking to seize more Ukrainian territory.Commenting on the Kremlin talks, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybhia said  Putin was \"wasting the world's time\".Ukraine has long insisted on firm security guarantees for Ukraine in any deal.On Wednesday, Zelensky said \"the world clearly feels that there is a real opportunity to end the war\" - but negotiations must be \"backed by pressure on Russia\", which Kyiv and its European allies accuse of deliberately stalling any ceasefire agreements.The Ukrainian president said last week his top negotiators had managed to make some key changes in the original US peace plan - seen as strongly favouring Moscow - during talks with an American delegation in Geneva on 23 November.In a joint statement, US and Ukrainian negotiators said at the time that they had drawn up an \"updated and refined peace framework\" - but provided no further details.Top negotiators from Europe - who had voiced concern over the original US plan - were also in the Swiss city last week, meeting separately with the Ukrainian and the US teams.In a separate development on Thursday, Germany's Der Spiegel news website said it had obtained a confidential transcript of a conference call in which European leaders expressed concern over the US negotiations.\"There is a possibility that the US will betray Ukraine on the issue of territory without clarity on security guarantees,\" French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly said, according to an English transcript of Monday's conference call.Meanwhile, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz was quoted as warning that Zelensky had to be \"extremely careful in the coming days\".\"They are playing games, both with you and with us,\" Merz reportedly said.Finnish President Alexander Stubb was also quoted as saying: \"We mustn't leave Ukraine and Volodymyr alone with these guys.\"The BBC has not seen the reported transcript. In response to a Der Spiegel inquiry, France's Élysée Palace stated that \"the president did not express himself in those terms\". The presidential office declined to provide details on how Macron expressed himself, citing confidentiality.Stubb declined to comment to Der Spiegel, and Merz has not commented on the issue.In a statement to the BBC, the White House said: \"Secretary [Marco] Rubio, Special Envoy Witkoff, Mr Kushner, and the President's entire national security team are working tirelessly to stop the killing between Russia and Ukraine.\"\"They have held productive meetings to gather feedback from both sides on a plan that can foster a durable, enforceable peace,\" the statement read.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.In recent weeks, Russian troops have been slowly advancing in south-east Ukraine, despite reported heavy combat casualties.",

    "body": "A prominent Palestinian militia leader in Gaza who opposed Hamas has been killed.Yasser Abu Shabab headed the so-called Popular Forces group, which has dozens of fighters and operates in Israeli-controlled territory near the southern city of Rafah.The Popular Forces said in a statement that Abu Shabab was shot while \"attempting to resolve a dispute\" between members of the Abu Seneima family. It dismissed as \"misleading\" reports that he was killed by Hamas, which had accused him of collaborating with Israel.An earlier statement from Abu Shabab's Bedouin tribe, the Tarabin, said he had been killed \"at the hands of the resistance\", and accused him of betraying the Palestinian people.Other sources said his death was the result of an internal power struggle.A Hamas statement said the \"fate that befell\" Abu Shabab was \"the inevitable fate of all who betray their people and homeland and are content to be tools in the hands of the occupation [Israel]\", without claiming involvement in his killing.Israel's Army Radio cited a security source as saying that Abu Shabab had died of his wounds after being evacuated to Soroka hospital in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba. But the hospital denied that he died under their care.The statement from the Popular Forces pledged to continue on Abu Shabab's \"path until the last terrorist is eliminated from the soil of Gaza and a bright and secure future is built for our people, who believe in peace\".In June, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that Israel was arming Palestinian clans in Gaza that he said were opposed to Hamas.It came after Israeli media reported that he had authorised the supply of weapons to the Popular Forces. However, the militia denied that it was being armed by Israel.The Popular Forces have been accused of looting humanitarian aid trucks sent into Gaza during the war, which the militia has also denied. Reports in Israel have also suggested that two of its members have previous links to the Islamic State group (IS).Since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began almost eight weeks ago, Abu Shabab had reportedly been one of several anti-Hamas militia leaders jostling for position in the second phase of US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan.It would involve setting up an interim government, deploying an international stabilisation force, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, and the disarmament of Hamas.Under the first phase, Hamas agreed to return all 48 living and dead hostages it was still holding in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails, as well as a partial Israeli withdrawal and a surge in humanitarian aid.The body of one dead Israeli hostage is yet to be returned.Israel's government has previously said it would not join talks on the second phase until Hamas has returned all the hostages. However, Trump said on Wednesday that the second phase was \"going to happen pretty soon\".The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 70,120 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "Kenya has signed a historic five-year health agreement with the US, the first such pact since Donald Trump's administration overhauled its foreign aid programme.The $2.5bn (£1.9bn) deal is aimed at combating infectious diseases in Kenya, with similar agreements expected to be rolled out in other African countries aligned with Trump's broader foreign policy goals.The government-to-government deal aims to boost transparency and accountability but has raised fears it could give the US real-time access to critical health databases, including sensitive patient information.Kenya's Health Minister Aden Duale sought to allay such fears, saying \"only de-identified, aggregated data\" would be shared.On his first day in office in January, Trump announced a freeze on foreign aid as part of a government spending review, dismantled the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and cut billions in aid to poorer countries. This has led to a drastic reduction in the availability of some drugs in developing countries.In September, the Trump administration introduced an \"America First Global Health Strategy\", making aid dependent on negotiations that officials said would cut waste and advance US priorities.Under the deal with Kenya, the US will contribute $1.7bn, with the Kenyan government covering $850m and gradually taking on more responsibility.The deal targets the prevention and treatment of HIV/Aids, malaria, and tuberculosis, maternal care, polio eradication and infectious disease outbreak response and preparedness.Signing the agreement with Kenya's President William Ruto, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio described it as a \"landmark agreement,\" and referred to Kenya as a \"longstanding American ally\".He praised Kenya for its role in leading and contributing to the UN-backed mission working to combat powerful gangs in Haiti.\"If we had five or 10 countries willing to step forward and do just half of what Kenya has done already, it would be an extraordinary achievement,\" said Rubio. The secretary of state explained that the US wanted its foreign aid to go directly to governments, rather than through aid agencies and charities.\"We are not going to spend billions of dollars funding the NGO industrial complex while close and important partners like Kenya either have no role to play or have very little influence over how health care money is being spent,\" he said.Kenya's president said the money would be used to work towards the country's priorities, such as buying modern equipment for hospitals and boosting the health workforce.\"I assure you that every shilling and every dollar will be spent efficiently, effectively, and accountably,\" Ruto added. However, some Kenyans are demanding the disclosure of the full agreement, with fears that it would allow the US to view personal medical records such as the HIV status, TB treatment history, and vaccination data of Kenyan patients. \"What specific data categories are being shared? Are genomic data, disease patterns, mental health data, insurance claims, hospital records, or biometrics included? If not, why is that not explicitly written?\" lawyer Willis Otieno posted on X. Well-known whistle-blower Nelson Amenya voiced similar concerns, urging the Kenyan government to release the full agreement so \"we can read it for ourselves\".Minister Duale has dismissed such fears, insisting that Kenya's health data remained secure and fully protected by Kenyan laws.\"Your health data is a national strategic asset,\" Duale added. US officials are yet to comment on the data concerns.A number of other African countries are expected to sign similar agreements by the end of the year, according to US officials. ",

    "body": "9 hours agoAdrienne MurrayCopenhagenThe parliament of the Faroe Islands voted on Thursday to legalise abortion until the end of the 12th week of pregnancy, overturning a decades-old law that prohibited abortions in most cases.Previous legislation allowed abortions only in certain circumstances - such as rape, incest or risk to the health of the pregnant woman - and meant the self-governing Danish territory had among the most restrictive abortion policies in Europe. Following a heated parliamentary debate, the decision came down to the wire, with MPs narrowly voting in favour of the reform, by 17 to 16.\"This is truly an historic day in the Faroe Islands,\" said Ingilín Didriksen Strømm, one of the four MPs who tabled the bill.Strømm told the BBC: \"This change finally affirms women's autonomy over their own bodies in the Faroe Islands.\"\"It guarantees access to safe healthcare, and it also protects our freedom to make decisions about our own lives without fear, without stigma and without criminalisation,\" she added.The new legislation in the Faroe Islands - located between Scotland and Norway - is expected to come into effect on 1 July next year, replacing laws dating back to 1956.Under that legislation, abortions could only be performed in special circumstances - which also included if there are severe fetal health problems or if the woman is deemed \"unfit\" to care for the child.Whether a woman is \"unfit\" or not is judged first by a GP, and then a second medical body, before an abortion is granted. Both the woman and the doctor risked imprisonment if the conditions were not met.Faroese pro-choice campaigners have argued the legislation was outdated and impinged on women's rights.\"This is a colossal change,\" Bjørt Lind from pro-choice campaign group Fritt Val told Danish newspaper Politiken.\"Abortion has been so hidden and taboo in Faroese society. When we started our work, no one dared to talk about it. It has gotten much better,\" she says. \"But it's still a huge challenge.\"In a statement to the BBC, Amnesty International's Faroe Islands branch said: \"After years of campaigning we finally have a law respecting women's and all pregnant people's rights to a safe and legal abortion until week 12.\"\"This is a huge step for human rights, the right to bodily autonomy and to secure safe abortions,\"  it added. \"And Faroese women don't have to go on an expensive trip abroad to have an abortion.\"With limited access to abortions in the Faroe Islands, campaign groups said women often had to travel to Denmark for the procedure.Danish law has allowed abortion up to 12 weeks since 1973, and in June this year, that was amended to extend terminations on request until 18 weeks.According to the Centre for Reproductive Rights, some 43 countries in Europe allow \"abortion on request\" during the early stages of pregnancy. Only five - Andorra, Malta, Liechtenstein, Poland and Monaco - maintain highly restrictive laws.Those opposed to the law change in the Faroe Islands, argued that the right of the fetus should be protected. Erhard Joensen, an MP who voted against Thursday's bill, told Danish national broadcaster, DR, that he respects the result, but does not believe there is much support for the new law. \"I think we will see that some will try to roll it back,\" he said.The remote archipelago is home to around 56,000 people, who speak Faroese and have a distinct cultural identity. Compared to other Nordic countries, society in the Faroe Islands is considered relatively conservative, with more than three quarters of the population members of the Lutheran church.Previous attempts to liberalise abortion laws have failed. Most recently, in May last year, an almost identical bill resulted in a tied vote, failing to secure the majority required to pass the Faroese parliament.",

    "body": "Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, has voted to introduce voluntary military service, in a move aimed at boosting national defences after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.It marks a significant shift in Germany's approach to its military and follows Chancellor Friedrich Merz's push to create Europe's strongest conventional army.The change means that all 18-year-olds in Germany will be sent a questionnaire from January 2026 asking if they are interested and willing to join the armed forces. The form will be mandatory for men and voluntary for women.Students at schools across Germany have said they will join strikes in as many as 90  cities on Friday to protest against the move.Many young Germans either oppose the new law or are sceptical.\"We don't want to spend half a year of our lives locked up in barracks, being trained in drill and obedience and learning to kill,\" the organisers of the protests wrote in a statement posted on social media.\"War offers no prospects for the future and destroys our livelihoods.\"In Hamburg alone, about 1,500 people were expected to join the protests, and school head teachers warned parents not to take their children out of school for the day.German MPs voted by 323 votes to 272 to back the change, making their country the latest European country to launch some form of revised military service. Last month, France said it was introducing 10 months of voluntary military training for 18- and 19-year-olds.The government says military service will be voluntary for as long as possible, but from July 2027, all 18-year-old men will have to take a medical exam to assess their fitness for possible military service.Universal medical examinations were necessary, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said, so that in the event of an attack, Germany would not waste time determining \"who is operationally capable as a homeland protector and who is not\".Germany's army, the Bundeswehr currently has around 182,000 troops and Pistorius wants to increase the number of soldiers in service by 20,000 over the next year.The long-term aim is to raise the number by the early 2030s to 260,000, supplemented by approximately 200,000 reservists, to meet new Nato force targets and strengthen Germany's defences.While the plan is for voluntary service, if the security situation worsens or if too few volunteers came forward, a form of compulsory military service could be considered by the Bundestag.If war were to break out, the military would be able to draw on the questionnaires and medical exams for potential recruits.Like other European countries, Germany ran down its armed forces during the peacetime years of the 1990s. During the Cold War it had an army of almost half a million.Compulsory military service in Germany was ended in 2011 under former chancellor Angela Merkel.But now, in the face of perceived threats from Russia and heavy pressure from Germany's traditional ally, the US, Friedrich Merz has pledged to rebuild the Bundeswehr into Europe's strongest conventional army.Nato countries have come under pressure from US President Donald Trump's White House to increase their spending on defence.Incentives for voluntary service are relatively high, with a promised salary of about €2,600 a month. In France, volunteers will be paid at least €800 (£700) a month.The Bundestag was also set to vote on Friday on a contentious pensions reform bill, which will keep the state pension at current levels until 2031.The bill is a key pillar of the coalition deal between Merz's conservatives and his centre-left partner, the Social Democrats, who have just a slender governing majority of just 12 votes.However, there had been doubts about whether it would pass the parliamentary vote, as  younger members of Merz's conservatives threatened to rebel. They say the plan is financially unsustainable and will leave younger generations shouldering the burden.But Germany's opposition far-left Left party said it would abstain from voting, which means the coalition needs fewer votes to pass it and so won't have to worry about potential rebels from its own ranks.A government crisis may narrowly have been averted.",

    "body": "14 hours agoBrandon DrenonAj AwerAj Awer, of the Cedar-Riverside Community Council, says Trump's comments were \"dangerous\"Somali-Americans in Minnesota have described their heightened fear after US President Donald Trump intensified his criticism of the community this week.Community leaders told the BBC the \"apprehension is palpable\" following Trump's remarks, in which he said he did not want Somalis in the US and the country would \"go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage\".\"When you're being targeted by the president of the United States, it's not really a good feeling,\" said Aj Awed, executive director of the Cedar-Riverside Community Council, which represents a town known as Little Mogadishu for its large Somali population.Concern has also intensified because of reports that officials have begun an enforcement operation in Minnesota targeting undocumented immigrants.Mr Awed said the council would discuss the risks of holding an annual event scheduled for next week in-person because of the operation.\"The people that are getting caught up in this are people who don't speak that great of English, but who have been citizens for decades,\" he said. \"Just because you have an accent does not make you less American.\"Trump made disparaging comments criticising the Somali community at the White House on Tuesday. \"I don't want them in our country, I'll be honest with you… their country is no good for a reason,\"he said.Mr Awed said the comments were \"dangerous\", adding it was \"not becoming of a president to be just attacking other Americans\".He also expressed concerns of violence that could follow.\"When the president puts a bull's eye on the immigrant community here\", that could encourage others to become \"more radicalised\", he said.President Trump's comments came after he was questioned about large-scale fraud in Minnesota's social assistance programme.Watch: Trump says he 'doesn't want' Somali migrants in USDozens of people have been charged over a scheme that federal prosecutors say involved a charity fraudulently billing the Minnesota government for meals for children during the Covid-19 pandemic. A number of Somali immigrants were implicated in that alleged scheme, which ultimately cost the state tens of millions of dollars, according to Kayseh Magan, a former investigator in Minnesota's attorney general's office.While those accused of involvement represent a small fraction of Minnesota's large Somali population, Trump has repeatedly criticised the community, writing in a post last month that the state has become a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity\".The House Oversight Committee said on Wednesday it was opening an investigation into Minnesota Governor Tim Walz's handling of the allegations.'Anyone who looks like me is scared' Jamal Osman, a member of the Minneapolis City Council, moved to the US when he was 14 and is a naturalised citizen. \"Anyone who looks like me [is] scared right now,\" he told CBS News.Of the fraud allegations that Trump has repeatedly referenced in his criticism of the Somali community, Osman said: \"My community is upset. Yes, people commit crimes, but an entire community should not be blamed based on what some individuals did.\"The Trump administration has ended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) - a programme for immigrants from countries in crisis - for Somali residents living in Minnesota.It said its enforcement operation would target those who have been issued final deportation orders. That operation began on Wednesday,  according to the BBC's US partner, CBS News.Abdilatif HassanKowsar Mohamed says Trump's comments have led to increased concern\"ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) is already here,\" said Kowsar Mohamed, who lives in south Minneapolis. The city is home to more than 80,000 people of Somali descent.\"We're seeing boots on the ground activity where folks are just being plucked off of the streets and being asked about their residency status. That's not a data informed approach,\" she said.\"Most folks have the identification necessary, so the fear is not around proof. The fear is around mistakes happening.\"There have been numerous reports of masked federal officers detaining US citizens and other lawful residents - over 170 instances, according to a ProPublica investigation in October.Social media videos filled with images of ICE agents smashing suspect's car windows and throwing them to the ground during detainments add to immigrants' fears, whether undocumented or not.A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, denied that any people would be targeted based on race.\"Every day, ICE enforces the laws of the nation across the country,\" said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. \"What makes someone a target of ICE is not their race or ethnicity, but the fact that they are in the country illegally.\"Local community organisations had been anticipating increased immigration enforcement, but after Trump's comments they ramped up preparations, Ms Mohamed said. One organisation, Monarca, has scheduled \"legal observer training\" in Minneapolis to educate people on their rights when witnessing federal immigration activity. Other ways the community is bracing itself, Ms Mohamed said, is by having emergency contacts ready-to-go in case of ICE encounters, and private messaging groups where people share photos of unmarked cars and masked agents.\"Everyone is just going to be in the space of caution,\" she said. \"Is there fear? Absolutely. But no one is tucking behind their tail.\" ",

    "body": "2 days agoWill GrantCentral America correspondent, TegucigalpaReutersPresidential candidate Salvador Nasralla has a small lead in the electionWith a little over two-thirds of the ballots in the Honduras election tallied, the lead has changed hands.The former vice-president, Salvador Nasralla, has a small but potentially significant lead over his rival, the conservative former mayor of Tegucigalpa, Nasry Asfura. Yet Asfura's National Party continues to brief journalists that they have the numbers for an eventual win.The race remains on a knife-edge. In Washington, President Donald Trump has staked his hopes on nothing less than an outright Asfura victory and has tried to directly influence the race in support of his favoured candidate.Whether it has been intimating that funds could be withheld from the impoverished Central American nation or making unsubstantiated allegations of electoral fraud, many in Honduras see the US president's fingerprints all over this election.To Honduran political analyst, Josué Murillo, it smacks of the kind of treatment Honduras expected from Washington during the Cold War.\"No government should come here and treat us as a banana republic. That is a lack of respect,\" he says in a coffee shop in Tegucigalpa.\"Donald Trump saying who we should elect violates our autonomy as a nation, and it affects our elections as well.\"Irrespective of whether the National Party go on to victory, one of their key figures is already celebrating.On Monday, ex-President Juan Orlando Hernández walked out of jail in Virginia a free man having served just one year of a 45-year sentence for drug-smuggling and weapons charges.His release came after Trump urged Honduran voters to cast their ballots for Asfura.Hernández was unexpectedly pardoned by Trump, despite having been found guilty last year by a court in New York of running a drug conspiracy which had brought more than 400 tonnes of cocaine into the United States.His time in office had also been marred by allegations of serious human rights violations by the police and security forces, particularly against government critics.So, when Hernández was arrested in 2022, then extradited to the United States and eventually jailed, most Hondurans celebrated it as a rare moment of justice in a nation riddled with institutional impunity, especially for the political elites.Trump has claimed the opposite, telling journalists on Air Force One that \"the people of Honduras really thought (Juan Orlando Hernández) was set up and it was a terrible thing\".ReutersEx-President Juan Orlando Hernández was extradited to the United States in 2022Journalists in Honduras who have covered the rise and fall of Hernández – from the moment he rose to national prominence following a coup in 2009 to his extradition – struggle to recognise that description of a roundly detested former president.However, he does still have his supporters, particularly in the National Party. And none have been more vocal in maintaining his innocence or calling for his pardon than his wife, Ana García Carías.I sat down with the former First Lady, who described Hernández's release as \"like being in a dream, a dream made reality\".\"We spoke to him this morning (Tuesday) and he is in a safe place. We were so happy, we got all the children onto the phone together with my mother-in-law, and shared a moment of happiness, laughter and prayer together.\"In terms of the future, the question now arises as to whether Hernández will attempt to return to Honduras. Ms García Carías says that his potential return depends less on the outcome of the election and more on whether the authorities will guarantee his safety.\"It depends on the security guarantees they give him in this country,\" she says.\"Day after day, this government – which thank God is on its way out – used a discourse of hate about my husband that they spoke of persecution against him. And that's very dangerous for an ex-president – to return to a place where they've cultivated hatred against him from the very top, the president, down to the lowliest functionary.\"Ms García Carías alleged her husband had been a victim of \"lawfare\", of \"the deep state\" and of a \"politically motivated witch-hunt\" by the Biden administration. I put it to her that the case against her husband had largely been drawn up by the Drug Enforcement Administration and the US Department of Justice during Trump's first term, not President Biden's.It was a point she quickly dismissed.\"That's what the prosecutors claimed but I think it's so illogical,\" she argues. \"In whose mind would it make sense to bring a man they say was a co-conspirator into meetings with the CIA, the DEA, to give classified information on national security?\"\"There was a political campaign (against him) involving figures in the Biden administration,\" she insisted, \"and I think there was manipulation of the facts after the event.\"ReutersAna García Carías, wife of the ex-president Juan Orlando Hernández, says he was a victim of the \"deep state\"Ms García Carías publicly recognised the role of two key MAGA figures in securing her husband's pardon: the influential conservative political advisor Roger Stone – himself the beneficiary of a Trump pardon – and the former Florida Congressman, Matt Gaetz. \"They both got involved with the case,\" she says. \"I recognise and thank them for their contribution. In fact, I spoke to Mr Stone on his radio programme on Sunday and he said that he had taken a letter from Juan Orlando, which he had written on his birthday to ask for a pardon and delivered it directly to President Trump.\"Meanwhile, the vote count in Honduras carries on into another night.As the ballots continue to be tallied, it should soon become clear whether Trump will get his way in Honduras and see a new ally elected in the country just as he pardons an old one.​​",

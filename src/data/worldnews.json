    "body": "Leveugle was arrested in 2024 after visiting his brother in the Isère department around Grenoble, a city in south-eastern France. At the time, Leveugle was living in Morocco.His brother's son - who had suspicions about his uncle - took advantage of his absence one day in October 2023 to examine a USB drive that belonged to Leveugle. It allegedly contained \"15 tomes of very dense material\" - photographs and written accounts of his \"sexual relations\" with minors, Manteaux said.\"The victims we have spoken to tell us that he spent a lot of time helping them to learn foreign languages, awakening their sense of culture... He has a complex personality,\" the prosecutor said.\"A lot of work has been done to identify all the victims. But in his journal, some only have first names, and there we found ourselves up against a wall. That's why we decided to launch this appeal - and also in case there are other victims not listed in his journal,\" Manteaux added.The prosecutor revealed that under questioning, Leveugle also allegedly admitted to killing his own mother and aunt by smothering them with cushions.He is accused of killing his mother in 1974 when she was in the terminal phase of cancer, and he allegedly did the same to his 92-year-old aunt in 1992.\"He explained to us that he told (his aunt) he had to leave for the Cévennes. She was pleading with him not to go, so he took the decision to kill her too,\" the prosecutor said.\"He justifies the killings by saying he hoped someone would do the same to him if he was in the same situation at the end of his life.\"A separate judicial investigation has been opened into these alleged killings.Under French law, alleged assaults that took place before 1993 come under the country's statute of limitations, so no prosecutions for them would be possible. However Manteaux said it was still important to get a full picture of Leveugle's alleged crimes.In two other recent and high-profile sexual assault cases in France, offenders kept records of their activities which were later key in bringing them to justice. In the Pélicot rape case,  Dominique Pélicot kept videos of men assaulting his sleeping wife Gisèle, whom he had drugged. He was jailed for 20 years.In Brittany, former doctor Joêl Le Scouarnec compiled detailed computer records of the hundreds of children he molested in hospital. Without this evidence, he may never have been convicted. He, too, was jailed for 20 years.",

    "body": "13 hours agoTabby WilsonGetty ImagesSinger Chappell Roan says she has left the talent agency led by Casey Wasserman, whose name appears in the Epstein files.Announcing her split with the agency, Roan said she has a \"duty to protect her team\" and her decision reflected her belief that \"meaningful change in our industry requires accountability\".Wasserman has been criticised after his flirtatious emails to Ghislaine Maxwell, sent in 2003, were revealed among the millions of files published in relation to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Roan made no mention of Epstein, nor the Epstein files, in her statement on Instagram announcing her departure.\"As of today, I am no longer represented by Wasserman, the talent agency led by Casey Wasserman,\" she said. Roan added: \"No artist, agent or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values.\" The BBC has reached out to Wasserman for comment.Wasserman is also the chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games, and has faced calls to step down from the position following the release of the emails.He said in a statement that his correspondence with Maxwell \"took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light\".Who is in the Epstein files?Wasserman also emphasised that he had \"never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein\".\"As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane,\" he said.\"I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.\"Wasserman has not been accused of wrongdoing by any of Epstein's victims, and the appearance of his name in the files does not imply criminal activity of any kind.Roan's announcement comes after two other bands represented by Wasserman released statements indicating they wanted to distance themselves from his agency.Wednesday, a self-described indie rock band, said they were \"aghast\" to see Wasserman feature in the Epstein files and did not want to continue to be associated with him. They said that they hoped he would step down \"for the sake of his staff\".Rock band Beach Bunny said they were \"hugely disappointed and disgusted\" that Wasserman \"had involvement with Ghislaine Maxwell\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoAmy WalkerGetty ImagesVenezuelan opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa has returned home after being captured by security forces on Sunday - but is under house arrest, his son has said.Ramón Guanipa said while his family was \"relieved\", his father remained \"unjustly imprisoned\". The country's opposition leader María Corina Machado said on Sunday that Guanipa had been taken in the capital Caracas by \"heavily armed men\". It came hours after Guanipa and other political prisoners were released.Venezuela's Interior and Justice Minister Diosdado Cabello later said \"a person\" was rearrested \"for violating the conditions under which he was released\".\"Some politicians believed they could do whatever they wanted,\" Cabello added on Monday.A former vice-president of the National Assembly, Guanipa spent eight months in prison and is among several political prisoners to have been freed since the US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in January.In an interview with the BBC on Tuesday, Ramón said his father, leader of the Justice First party, had initially been released from prison at about 11:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on Sunday.He said his father then spent time with families waiting for the release of other political prisoners.\"He made some statements, he mobilised a lot of people,\" Ramón said, continuing: \"He went on an interview... and after that he was kidnapped by security forces that weren't wearing uniform, that weren't identified properly.\"During the BBC interview, Guanipa's son said he had been informed that his father would be returned and placed under house arrest. But he said no further information was shared about when his father would be transported.Later on Tuesday, Ramón posted on his father's X account, saying: \"I confirm that my father, Juan Pablo Guanipa, is at our home in Maracaibo. We are relieved to know that our family will soon be together.\"He added: \"My father remains unjustly imprisoned, because house arrest is still imprisonment, and we demand his full freedom, as well as the freedom of all political prisoners.\"Ramón thanked the US government, including President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, for \"their efforts in support of freedom in Venezuela and for all political prisoners\".'He mobilised a lot of people', says Guanipa's sonGuanipa's centre-right party had previously said the 61-year-old was kidnapped by the \"repressive forces of the dictatorship\" while he was moving between locations.It added that those accompanying him warned that weapons were pointed at the group before Guanipa was loaded into a car.\"We hold Delcy Rodríguez, Jorge Rodríguez, and Diosdado Cabello responsible for any harm to Juan Pablo's life,\" Justice First wrote on social media, referring to Venezuela's interim president, the National Assembly speaker, and the interior minister respectively.The party also called on the international community to demand Guanipa's \"immediate release\", as well as an end to the Venezuelan government's \"persecution of the opposition\".When Guanipa was recaptured on Sunday, Ramón and a key figure in Venezuela's opposition, Edmundo González, had demanded proof of life.Guanipa, a political ally of Machado, was among at least 30 people freed on Sunday, according to Venezuelan human rights group Foro Penal, which provides assistance to political prisoners in the country.He was elected governor of the Zulia region in 2017, but barred from taking office after refusing to swear an oath before Maduro's National Constituent Assembly.He then went into hiding after being accused of terrorism and treason for challenging the 2024 election result.Guanipa was later tracked down by Venezuela's security forces and detained in May 2025.Opposition and human rights groups say the government under Maduro had for years used detentions of political prisoners to stamp out dissent and silence critics.Many were detained after the 2024 presidential election, when Maduro claimed victory despite opponents and many countries disputing the results.The Venezuelan government has denied holding political prisoners, insisting they were arrested for criminal activity.",

I've never felt more uncomfortable or humiliated in my entire life.\"Wedding DJ Fat Tony previously told ITV's This Morning that \"the whole situation was really awkward for everyone in the room\".After speculation about the nature of Lady Beckham's dancing, Fat Tony clarified: \"There was no slut-dropping, there was no black cat PVC catsuits, there was no Spice Girl action.\"Fat Tony claimed Marc Anthony had called for \"the most beautiful woman in the room\" to come up for the first dance with Brooklyn, but then said Lady Beckham's name instead of Nicola's. The DJ said this led to the bride running out of the room in tears.Sir David and Lady Beckham have not responded to repeated requests for comment on the claims in their eldest son's statementHowever, when asked about young people and their social media use in Davos last month, Sir David remarked that children are \"allowed to make mistakes\".",

    "body": "\"As of this morning, law enforcement has uncovered these previously inaccessible new images showing an armed individual appearing to have tampered with the camera at Nancy Guthrie's front door the morning of her disappearance,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said in a statement on X. He said authorities had been working to recover images from the home surveillance system that \"may have been lost, corrupted, or inaccessible due to a variety of factors - including the removal of recording devices\".  Officials also released two short videos showing the person approach the front door of Nancy Guthrie's home, then check camera before moving away, picking up some vegetation from the ground and using it to cover the camera lens. Savannah Guthrie shared the new video on Instagram. \"Someone out there recognises this person,\" she said on Tuesday. \"We believe she is still out there. Bring her home.\"This marks the first major breakthrough in a case that has gripped the country for more than a week.On Monday, police were still saying they had yet to identify any suspects or vehicles connected to Nancy Guthrie's disappearance, the same day Savannah Guthrie issued a new video appeal to anyone with information.\"We believe our mum is still out there,\" she said in a video posted to her Instagram account. \"We need your help.\"She renewed that appeal on Tuesday, reposting the surveillance images on her Instagram with the message: \"We believe she is still alive. Bring her home.\" The FBI is offering a $50,000 (£36,000) reward for any information.FBIFBIWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said President Donald Trump has reviewed the footage. She said he encouraged people with any information to contact authorities. \"The prayers of this entire White House are with Savannah and her family at this time. We hope this person is found soon and her mother is brought home safely,\" she said. Last week, Pima County officials said that home's doorbell camera  was disconnected at 01:47 local time and the camera's software registered motion a short time after, at 02:12.At 02:28, the app on her pacemaker, an implanted cardiac device, disconnected from her phone.Police also said they had found blood on Nancy Guthrie's porch and analyses confirmed it was hers.Authorities have said say there are taking an email with a ransom note sent to US media outlets stating a Monday deadline seriously, the BBC's US partner CBS News reported.A previous apparent deadline for ransom, which was demanded in Bitcoin, passed on 5 February.It was one of three reported ransom notes sent in the case. Officials made one arrest last week in relation to a hoax ransom note. The family has indicated that they would be willing to pay for their mother's safe return.",

    "body": "Macron repeated his call for EU-wide mutualised loans in order to raise hundreds of billions of euros needed for industrial investment.\"The time has come to launch a shared debt capacity to fund our future expense -  eurobonds for the future. We need big European programmes to finance the best projects,\" he said.Similar calls in the past have met scepticism from Germany and other countries, who feel France wants to use Europe to bear a financial burden which it alone - because of its failure to reform - is unable to take up.Macron admitted that France \"has never had a balanced model, unlike certain economies of the north, which are built more on a sense of responsibility. \"And we have never had reforms like the ones initiated in the 2010s in Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece, which are paying dividends today.\"But he said there was growing demand in the world's financial markets for mutualised European debt, which currently the EU was not equipped to supply.\"The world markets are increasingly afraid of the American greenback [dollar]. They want alternatives… \"For investors everywhere a democratic state of law is a huge attraction. And when I look at the world as it is, we have the authoritarian regime that is China, and on the other side we have the US distancing itself further and further from a state of law.\"According to Macron, the 27-member EU needs €1,2tn (£1tn; $1.4tn) a year to invest in the vital sectors of security and defence, clean energy, and artificial intelligence.Calling on the EU to \"protect\" these and other industries, he said: \"The Chinese do it, the Americans too.  Europe today is the most open market in the world.\"In the face of that, I am not saying we should be protectionist. It's more a question of being coherent - in other words not imposing on our own producers rules which we do not impose on non-Europeans.\"\"Today Europe faces a massive challenge, in a world of disorder,\" he said.\"Climate change is accelerating. The US – which we thought would guarantee our security for ever – is no longer sure. Russia was to give us cheap energy for ever, but that stopped three years ago. China... has become a rival that gets fiercer and fiercer.\"Today, we Europeans are on our own. But we have each other. We are 450 million people. It's huge. For me [becoming a power] is the fulfilment of the European adventure.\"We came together to stop war, we came together to build a market. But we always forbade ourselves to think of power.\"Asked about the latest stand-off with Washington over Greenland, at the end of which US President Donald Trump appeared to back down from threats to annex the Danish territory,  Macron said the Europeans should not be fooled.\"At the end of a crisis, there is a cowardly tendency to sit back and say 'phew'. There are threats and intimidation, and then suddenly Washington gives way. And people think it's over.\"Don't believe it for a single second,\" the French leader said.",

Some lawmakers have called on Lutnick to resign, but on Tuesday the White House said he had the full support of President Donald Trump.The commerce secretary had previously told Congress that he cut ties with Epstein in 2005 after the late financier - a neighbor of Lutnick's in New York - used sexual innuendo to explain why he owned a massage table in a room of his home.In Tuesday's testimony, he said: \"Over the next 14 years, I met him two other times that I can recall.\" The justice department files show Lutnick visited Epstein's Caribbean island on 23 December 2012. That came four years after Epstein was convicted for soliciting prostitution from a child. Lutnick's testimony on Capitol Hill marked the first time he publicly confirmed the visit.\"I don't recall why we did it, but we did it,\" he said Tuesday, referring to the lunch. Lutnick has not been accused of any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.The other time, outside of meeting Epstein on his island, was a year and a half after that when Lutnick said he had an hour-long meeting with Epstein. Lutnick noted that within the millions of pages of Epstein documents released by the justice department, roughly 10 emails connect him with Epstein. \"Over a 14-year period, I did not have any relationship with him, I barely had anything to do with that person,\" he said. Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, grilled Lutnick about the conflicting accounts.\"The issue is not that you engaged in any wrongdoing in connection with Jeffrey Epstein, but that you totally misrepresented the extent of your relationship with him, to the congress, to the American people and to the survivors of his despicable criminal and predatory acts,\" he said.Lutnick is among a series of high profile people named in the more than 3.5 million documents that have been released by the justice department, as mandated by law. The revelation that he had visited Epstein's island long after he asserted that he had cut off contact has led to bipartisan calls for the commerce secretary to resign from the Trump administration. Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna and Republican Congressman Thomas Massie, who co-sponsored the law that compelled the justice department to release the Epstein files last year, have both urged Lutnick to step down. Khanna and Massie are continuing to pursue further disclosure. After viewing unredacted copies of the files, Khanna revealed the names of six other people on Tuesday that he says were improperly blacked out. Massie said they are \"likely incriminated by their inclusion in these files\".The BBC is contacting the people for comment. While Lutnick was testifying on one side of Capitol Hill, survivors of Epstein abuse gathered on the other to announce Virginia's Law, legislation that aims to remove the time limit for survivors of sexual abuse to file civil claims.The legislation is named for Virginia Giuffre, who was one of the most well-known survivors of Epstein's sexual abuse. She died by suicide in 2025.Giuffre's sister-in-law Amanda Roberts said her wish was to eliminate the statute of limitations. \"No more laws that treat survivors as though time can erase harm,\" Roberts said, before adding: \"Pass Virginia's Law.\"Getty Images",

Eternally grateful. There is less light in my world, this lucky world that had you, will keep you, always.\"The actress starred in six seasons of comedy series Schitt's Creek, for which she won an Emmy for best comedy actress. Show creator and co-star Eugene Levy told People magazine that he has had the \"honor of knowing and working with the great Catherine O'Hara for over fifty years\".\"Words seem inadequate to express the loss I feel today,\" he said. Co-creator Dan Levy, who played O'Hara's son David, described her as \"family before she ever played my family\".He added on Instagram that he would \"cherish every funny memory I was fortunate enough to make with her\".O'Hara's on-screen son in holiday classics Home Alone and Home Alone 2: Lost In New York, Macaulay Culkin, also paid an emotional tribute on Instagram.\"Mama. I thought we had time. I wanted more. I wanted to sit in a chair next to you,\" he wrote.\"I heard you. But I had so much more to say. I love you. I'll see you later.\"O'Hara is survived by her husband Bo Welch, her sons Matthew and Luke, and her six siblings.What is a pulmonary embolism?According to the NHS, a pulmonary embolism is a life-threatening condition that occurs when a blood vessel in the lungs is blocked by a blood clot.Symptoms include a sudden difficulty in breathing, chest pain that increases when breathing and coughing up blood.

    "body": "14 hours agoJoel GuintoandVirma SimonetteGetty ImagesThe Philippine Supreme Court in a landmark decision has ruled that same-sex couples can be considered co-owners of property.Applying a provision of the country's Family Code for the first time, the court said same-sex couples can be recognised as co-owners if it is proven that both parties contributed to acquiring a property.Same-sex unions are outlawed in conservative Catholic Philippines and it is the only country in the world, outside of the Vatican, that does not allow divorce.This has left LGBT couples without legal protections when it comes to property, finance and healthcare.The Supreme Court ruling, which was made public on Tuesday, involved a former couple - two women - who had feuded over plans to sell their house and lot in suburban Manila.One of the women refused to sell their house after initially agreeing to do so, leading the other to file a claim before a lower court asking to divide their property. The lower court denied the claim, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.But the Supreme Court on 5 February reversed the lower court rulings. It cited a document made by one partner - and acknowledged by the other - that she paid 50% of the purchase and renovation costs.The property was registered under the name of only one of the partners to make the paperwork during the acquisition faster, since they were not married or related by blood.While the Family Code defines marriage as a bond between a man and a woman, the court said Article 148 - which governs \"property relations of people who live together but cannot legally marry\" - does not discriminate based on gender and \"applies to all forms of co-habitation\".Article 148 applies to same-sex couples, \"otherwise, we render legally invisible some forms of legitimate intimate relationships\", said Associate Justice Marvic Leonen.Associate Justice Amy Lazaro Javier further noted that Article 148 must not be limited to heterosexual couples \"given the prevailing values in modern society as well as the glaring yet unjustified difference in the treatment of heterosexual couples vis-à-vis their homosexual counterparts\".A spokesperson for the Supreme Court, Camille Ting, confirmed to the BBC that it is the first time Article 148 of the Family Code has been used to decide on a case regarding property rights of a same-sex couple.The court in its decision also called on government and lawmakers to address the needs of same-sex couples.\"With the political, moral, and cultural questions that surround the issue concerning the rights of same-sex couples, political departments especially the Congress must be involved to quest for solutions,\" the court said.",

    "body": "Getty ImagesAfter arriving in Washington, the monks will visit the Washington National Cathedral and the Lincoln Memorial.The group also reportedly plans to appeal to lawmakers to declare Buddha's birthday - called Vesak - a national holiday - but their expedition has gained traction beyond this policy request.\"Their long journey and gentle witness invite us all to deepen our commitment to compassion,\" said Washington Episcopal Bishop Mariann Budde, who will help host the monks at an interfaith reception, according to the Associated Press.The 19 travelling monks are from Theravada Buddhist monasteries around the globe.The final day of their single-file trek across the country began on Tuesday morning in Arlington, Virginia, roughly five miles (9.1km) outside the US capitol. A livestream on the group's Facebook account shows them walking past piles of snow, as the first days of above-freezing temperatures return after weeks of record cold across much of the eastern United States. They are cheered on by rows of onlookers in the video.\"May you be safe and warm. Thank you for your walk of peace. We desperately need this in our world now,\" one user wrote. For the last 108 days - a sacred number in Buddhism representing spiritual completion - the group has walked this same single-file line step by step. But the trip has not been without incident. In November, an escort vehicle that accompanied the monks as they walked alongside a highway in Houston, Texas was hit by a truck, injuring two of the monks. One of them had his leg amputated. Their return to Texas is likely to be quicker - and easier - as they are expected to commute back via bus, arriving in Fort Worth on Saturday. ",

    "body": "The White House has demanded that Canada \"share authority\" and ownership of a new bridge connecting the two countries after a \"clear and direct\" call between Donald Trump and Prime Minister Mark Carney.The Gordie Howe International Bridge, connecting the Canadian province of Ontario to the US state of Michigan, will not open until Ottawa \"treats the United States with the Fairness and Respect that we deserve\", Trump wrote on social media earlier. The bridge is funded by the Canadian government but will be publicly owned by both Canada and Michigan.Prime Minister Mark Carney said on Tuesday he had a \"positive\" conversation with   Trump, reminding him Canada paid for the bridge.AFP via Getty ImagesThe Gordie Howe International Bridge will connect southern Detroit, Michigan, USA, and Windsor, Ontario, Canada when completedCarney said he also reminded the president that it was built by US and Canadian workers and with steel from both countries.\"This is a great example of cooperation between our countries and I look forward to it opening,\" he told reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday. He said that Trump asked that the US ambassador to Canada, Pete Hoekstra, who is from Michigan, \"play a role in smoothing the conversation in and around the bridge\". Speaking to reporters at the White House hours after the call, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump viewed Canadian ownership of land on both sides of the bridge as \"unacceptable\".\"He [Trump] also believes that that US should own at least half of the bridge, have shared authority over what passes across it and participate in the economic benefits generated by US use,\" she added. It is not clear how Trump could block its opening but he said in his initial post that negotiations would begin immediately, without elaborating. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he was glad to hear about the Trump-Carney call, adding he was \"confident\" the bridge would open as planned as it was in the best interests of the economies of both countries. On Monday, Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat, said closing the \"incredibly important infrastructure project\" would be \"awful for our state's economy\".The move could have \"serious repercussions\" she said in a post on X: \"Higher costs for Michigan businesses, less secure supply chains, and ultimately, fewer jobs.\"The bridge, which spans the Detroit River and is named after late Canadian hockey legend Gordie Howe, who played for the Detroit Red Wings, is expected to open to traffic pending formal tests and approvals in the early part of this year. Construction began in 2018, but the project has been a point of contention between the countries for more than a decade.It is estimated to have cost $6.4bn CAD (£3.4bn).The organisation developing the bridge, the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority, is a Canadian federal Crown corporation, an organisation that is wholly owned by the government but operates at arm's length.In his Truth Social post, Trump wrote: \"The Canadian Government expects me, as President of the United States, to PERMIT them to just 'take advantage of America!'\"\"I will not allow this bridge to open until the United States is fully compensated for everything we have given them,\" he added.He also blamed former President Barack Obama for allowing construction to begin without the use of any US steel.But Mayor Drew Dilkens of Windsor, Ontario, on the Canadian side of the bridge, told the CBC that this accusation was wrong.\"It's just insane,\" he said. \"I really can't believe what I'm reading.\"On Fox Business on Tuesday, Jamieson Greer, Trump's trade chief, said the negotiations the president mentioned in his social media post were specific to the bridge, and making sure that proceeds from economic activity like tolls also went to the US.The Moroun family - the American owners of the neighbouring Ambassador Bridge that also connects Detroit to Canada - appealed to Trump during his first term to stop construction of the new bridge, arguing that it infringed on their exclusive ability to collect tolls. In response, Trump and then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a joint statement saying the bridge was a \"vital economic link\" between the countries. Michigan's Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer pushed back on Trump's threat to close the bridge, saying it was good for jobs in her state.\"This project has been a tremendous example of bipartisan and international cooperation,\" Whitmer's press secretary Stacey LaRouche told the CBC.Trump on Monday pointed to recent trade disputes between the two countries, saying that \"the Tariffs Canada charges us for our Dairy products have, for many years, been unacceptable\". He also said that a trade deal signed between Canada and China last month would \"eat Canada alive\". Trump continued: \"The first thing China will do is terminate ALL Ice Hockey being played in Canada, and permanently eliminate The Stanley Cup.\"But Slotkin hit back at this, saying the only reason Canada was on the verge of a trade deal with China was because Trump \"has kicked them in the teeth for a year\".Canada is our friend, not our enemy, she added, promising to work to get the project back on track.",

    "body": "Bid launched to extend Zimbabwe president's term in office28 minutes agoShingai NyokaHarareGetty ImagesEmmerson Mnangagwa, once Robert Mugabe's deputy, is due to step down in 2028Zimbabwe's cabinet has approved draft legislation that would allow President Emmerson Mnangagwa, 83, to extend his stay in office until at least 2030.Presidents would be chosen by MPs rather than in a direct vote and could serve a maximum of two seven-year terms, rather than the current five-year terms, under the proposals.Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi said public consultations would be held before the bill heads to parliament for debate, where both chambers are dominated by the ruling Zanu-PF party.Legal challenges are likely as constitutional experts argue a referendum is needed if term limits are changed - and also point out that such amendments cannot benefit a sitting president.Mnangagwa, who first came to power in 2017 after a military coup ousted long-time leader Robert Mugabe, won a presidential election the next year and a second term in 2023 - though the results were disputed.Known as \"the crocodile\" because of his political cunning, his final five-year term is due to expire in 2028.In a referendum held 13 years ago, Zimbabweans overwhelmingly voted for a new constitution that introduced presidential term limits when Mugabe's grip on power seemed entrenched - he had ruled the country since independence in 1980.Hints that Mnangagwa, who was once Mugabe's deputy until they fell out over the growing political ambitions of the then-first lady, wanted to stay in power beyond 2028 started two years ago.The slogan \"2030 he will still be the leader\" began to be chanted at Zanu-PF rallies with his supporters saying he needed to remain in office to complete his \"Agenda 2030\" development programme - though President Mnangagwa publicly rejected the idea.He has faced some fierce detractors within Zanu-PF, but his main critic - Blessed Geza, also known as \"Bombshell\" - died last week.This time last year Geza, a respected veteran of the 1970s war of independence and then member of Zanu-PF's powerful central committee, had launched a scathing attack on Mnangagwa's ambition to stay in power.He apologised for helping him come into office and accused the president of nepotism in his bid to stay in office beyond 2028.Zanu-PF expelled Geza from the party for disloyalty and he was forced into hiding.Yet he continued to attract a large following on social media, where he regularly posted videos calling for protests.Hours before his death a message posted on his social media pages urged Zimbabweans to carry forward the \"noble war\" to remove President Mnangagwa and \"end the plunder of our country\".He was in South Africa when his family announced his death on Friday.\"At a time when silence would have been easier, he chose to speak out against corruption and nepotism that continue to undermine the promise of independence,\" Andrease Ethan Mathibela, national chairman of the influential Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association, said.The government is now forging forward with its 2030 plans for Mnangagwa and says the intention behind the draft law is to strengthen governance and bring political stability.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "9 hours agoNick EdserBusiness reporterBloomberg via Getty ImagesBP has reported a drop in annual profits and increased its target for cost cutting as the oil giant was hit by the fall in crude prices last year.It reported profits of $7.5bn (£5.5bn) in 2025, down from $8.9bn the year before, after the price of oil fell by about 20%.BP also said it was suspending its share buyback programme and cutting spending as it seeks to strengthen its finances.The company has recently switched strategy away from investment in renewable energy projects to refocus on oil and gas operations, and new boss Meg O'Neill, who takes up her position in April, is expected to continue this trend.O'Neill, formerly head of Australian oil and gas firm Woodside Energy, will be the the first woman to run a major global oil firm.Carol Howle, BP's current interim chief executive, said the company looked forward to O'Neill's arrival \"as we accelerate our progress to build a simpler, stronger and more valuable BP for the future\".The company has come under pressure from its shareholders for underperforming compared to its rivals in recent years.A year ago, BP announced it was cutting planned investments in renewable energy to spend billions of dollars more a year on its core oil and gas operations.The energy giant is trying to cut its debts, which currently stand at about $22bn.Announcing its latest results, BP said it aimed to make cost savings of $5.5bn-$6.5bn by the end of 2027. This is an increase from its previous target of up to $5bn, and comes after its decision to sell a 65% stake in its Castrol business.\"Management is taking some decisive action to fix the balance sheet, scrapping the buyback, doubling down on non-core disposals and upping structural cost-savings targets,\" said Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown.Profits in the final three months of the year fell 30% to $1.54bn, in a period when the price of Brent crude oil fell below $60 a barrel for the first time in more than four years.BP's annual profits have now fallen for three years in a row. They peaked at $27.7bn in 2022 when oil prices soared in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Rival oil giant Shell also announced a fall in profits when it posted its annual results last week. Shell reported underlying earnings of $18.53bn for 2025, a 22% fall on the previous year.ReutersMeg O'Neill will take up her new role in AprilO'Neill takes over at BP at a difficult time for the oil giant. Its previous boss, Murray Auchincloss, stepped down after less than two years in the job.He had replaced Bernard Looney, who was dismissed by BP in 2023 after he was found to have committed \"serious misconduct\" in failing to disclose relationships with colleagues.Cornelia Meyer, chief executive of Meyer Resources and a former BP executive, told the BBC that O'Neill had \"a stellar track record\", and when it comes to reviving BP's fortunes, \"if anybody can, she probably can\".She added O'Neill would \"instil discipline\", noting \"she's an oil woman, she's not a renewables woman\".However, BP is facing questions from some groups over its recent investment decisions.Nick Mazan from ACCR, the shareholder advocacy and research organisation that has tabled the resolution, said by halting its share buyback and continuing to invest in oil and gas, \"BP doesn't appear to have shareholder interests at heart\".\"While the pivot back to oil and gas has been justified by scapegoating the low carbon business, our analysis shows that the upstream business has been the source of 75% of disposal losses and impairments since 2020.\"",

    "body": "Rescue workers in Mexico are searching for at least 65 people who are missing after torrential rains triggered flooding in 150 locations across five states.At least 64 residents are confirmed dead, according to official figures updated by the government on Monday.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has promised help for the affected areas.The heavy rains, caused by two tropical storms, triggered landslides and caused rivers to overflow, sweeping away entire homes as well as roads and cars. María Salas, 49, lost five members of her family when their home collapsed in Huauchinango, a town in the mountains in the north of Puebla state. She told Agence France Press news agency that her own house had been swept away by a landslide: \"I can't get my belongings, I can't sleep there. I have nothing.\"The town is one of the few which is accessible within the disaster zone. On Sunday, President Sheinbaum visited a shelter in Huauchinango and said that officials would inspect the damage the town suffered.\"Everyone will get help to rebuild their homes,\" she told those whose houses had been swept away or made uninhabitable. An estimated 100 small communities remain cut off as the flooding has damaged power supplies and communication lines. ",

    "body": "5 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesNexperia is based in the Netherlands and operates factories worldwide, including in the UKThe Dutch government has taken control of Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands, in a bid to safeguard the European supply of semiconductors for cars and other electronic goods and protect Europe's economic security.The Hague said it took the decision due to \"serious governance shortcomings\" and to prevent the chips from becoming unavailable in an emergency.Nexperia's owner Wingtech said on Monday that it would take actions to protect its rights and would seek government support.The development threatens to raise tensions between the European Union and China, which have increased in recent months over trade and Beijing's relationship with Russia.In December 2024, the US government placed Wingtech on its so-called \"entity list\", identifying the company as a national security concern. Under the regulations, US companies are barred from exporting American-made goods to businesses on the list unless they have special approval.In the UK, Nexperia was forced to sell its silicon chip plant in Newport, after MPs and ministers expressed national security concerns. It currently owns a UK facility in Stockport.The Dutch Economic Ministry said it made the \"highly exceptional\" decision to invoke the Goods Availability Act over \"acute signals of serious governance shortcomings\" within Nexperia.\"These signals posed a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities,\" the ministry said in a statement.\"Losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security.\"The statement did not detail why it thought the firm's operations were risky. A spokesperson for the minister of economic affairs told the BBC there was no further information to share.The measures are aimed to keep European chip supplies flowing and protect Dutch intellectual property, said EU-China researcher Sacha Courtial.In a crisis, a Chinese-owned company could come under pressure from Beijing to halt supplies or prioritise sales to China, crippling European industries like carmakers and electronics manufacturers, he said.The Hague's move puts economic security \"over free-market investment principles\", in what could pave the way for other governments to follow, said Mr Courtial from the Jacques Delors Institute.The China Semiconductor Industry Association said on Tuesday that it is \"seriously concerned\" about the Dutch government taking control of Nexperia. The group described the measures as \"selective and discriminatory\" against overseas branches of Chinese enterprises and undermine open trade.'Mitigating risk'The Goods Availability Act is designed to allow the Hague to intervene in companies under exceptional circumstances. These include threats to the country's economic security and to ensure the supply of critical goods.Under the order, the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs, Vincent Karremans, could reverse or block Nexperia's decisions if they were potentially harmful to the company's interests, to its future as a business in the Netherlands or Europe, or to ensure supply remains available in an emergency.The Dutch government added the company's production can continue as normal.\"This measure is intended to mitigate that risk,\" the ministry said.Shanghai-listed shares in Nexperia's parent company Wingtech fell by 10% on Monday morning.A Nexperia spokesperson said the company \"complies with all existing laws and regulations, export controls and sanctions regimes,\" and had no further comment.In a statement in Mandarin, Wingtech said its operations were continuing uninterrupted and it remained in close communication with its suppliers and customers.Wingtech said in a stock filing that the company's chairman, Zhang Xuezheng, was suspended from Nexperia's boards by an Amsterdam court order earlier this month.The company was also in talks with lawyers about potential legal remedies, it added.The BBC has also contacted the Chinese embassies in the Netherlands and Brussels.",

    "body": "Venezuela announced on Monday it would close its embassy in Oslo, days after opposition leader María Corina Machado was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.In a statement, the Venezuelan government did not comment on Machado's prize, saying that the closure was part of a restructuring of its foreign service.Norway's foreign ministry confirmed that Caracas had closed its embassy in Oslo without providing a reason.The Nobel Committee in Oslo awarded her the prize on Friday in recognition of what it called \"her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela\", while Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro referred to the 58-year-old laureate as a \"demonic witch\".The Norwegian foreign ministry called the decision \"regrettable\". \"Despite our differences on several issues, Norway wishes to keep the dialogue open with Venezuela and will continue to work in this direction,\" a ministry spokeswoman said.She added that the Nobel Prize \"is independent of the Norwegian government\".Machado has for years been campaigning against Maduro, whose 12-year rule is viewed by many nations as illegitimate.She has been forced to live in hiding for much of the past year.María Corina Machado wins Nobel Peace PrizeIn honouring her achievement, Nobel chairman Jørgen Watne Frydnes called Machado a \"key, unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided... in a brutal authoritarian state that is now suffering a humanitarian and economic crisis.\"Machado told BBC Mundo her award was \"like an injection\" for her political movement. \"It infuses energy, hope, strength on the Venezuelan people because we realise that we are not alone,\" she said.Caracas also closed its embassy in Australia while opening new outposts in Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso, which it called \"strategic partners in the fight\" against \"hegemonic pressures\".Venezuela's closure of embassies in two close US allies comes after weeks of heightened tension between Caracas and Washington.The US military has destroyed at least four boats that it said were carrying narcotics from Venezuela to the US, killing at least 21 people on board, in what the Trump administration calls a war on drugs. The strikes have attracted condemnation in countries including Venezuela and Colombia, with some international lawyers describing the strikes as a breach of international law.The last time Norway suffered a diplomatic blow over the Nobel Peace Prize was with China in 2010, when it was awarded to political dissident Liu Xiaobo. Beijing suspended trade and other relations, and only normalised ties with Oslo six years later. ",

    "body": "About a dozen of us walked into a US immigration office in Virginia on Saturday morning, people born all over the world excited to take the final step in becoming American citizens.We clutched our naturalisation notices as we filed through security and lined up at the check-in desk. Soon, we would raise our right hands and swear the Oath of Allegiance to the United States in a ceremony that is known as both solemn and celebratory. Carrying small American flags, we would walk out citizens.But then, abruptly, we learned the ceremony had been cancelled because of the government shutdown.\"You should have been notified,\" said the staff member at the desk.None of us had received any emails or phone calls. The staff at the entrance had let us in without warning, raising the possibility that they too had not been notified.Later, when I checked the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website, it was temporarily down.When it came back online, I saw my appointment had been cancelled days earlier \"due to unforeseen circumstances.\" If you hadn't checked the website yourself, you would never have known.\"We regret any inconvenience this may cause,\" the notice said.Around me at the office, disappointment quickly turned into confusion.One woman in a hijab quietly asked if I had been turned away too, worried it might have been because of her clothing. A man had gathered his family to celebrate his final step to becoming a US citizen, only to leave anxious and uncertain.  A few people seemed genuinely frightened, wondering how the delay might affect their work, lives and plans.This was more than an inconvenience.Some of us had spent years plodding through paperwork and interviews, as well as preparing for the citizenship test.  After more than a decade of having a green card, I had decided to become a citizen and vote. All of us now were stuck in limbo.At the office, we were told to come back on 1 November. With the ongoing federal shutdown, though, there's a chance that could slip.The immigration service is largely funded by application fees and so it typically stays open during a government shutdown.But its director, Joseph Edlow, said in a post on X that public-facing services such as interviews and naturalisation ceremonies can be delayed. He added that the agency \"regrets any negative impacts but must ensure it complies with the law\".It's unclear how many USCIS appointments or oath ceremonies have been cancelled nationwide. The service lists field office closures on a web page, but it does not provide totals for cancelled ceremonies.  Anecdotal reports have circulated online about other oath ceremonies that have been scrapped.What's also unclear is when the government will reopen.Republicans and Democrats have been deadlocked over government funding since 1 October, leading to a shutdown that has placed more than 700,000 federal workers on unpaid leave.Add on the many rapid changes made to US immigration policies in the last nine months, and the anxiety among those of us working to become American citizens can only rise. The effects of a Washington stalemate are rippling into the everyday lives - and possibly futures - of those of us hoping to call the US our permanent home.",

    "body": "5 hours agoHarry Sekulich andLaura GozziUS President Donald Trump is considering sending long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine.Asked by reporters on Air Force One on Sunday whether he would provide Kyiv with Tomahawks, Trump replied: \"We'll see... I may\". The missiles would be \"a new step of aggression\" in Ukraine's war with Russia, he said.The comments follow a phone call at the weekend between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who pushed for stronger military support to launch counter-attacks against Russia.Zelensky has said he will meet Trump in Washington on Friday for talks that will focus on air defence and long-range capabilities.Trump confirmed what would be the Ukrainian leader's third visit to the White House since January when a reporter asked if he plans to host Zelensky on Friday.\"I think so, yeah,\" the US president said during a brief fuel stop as he travelled back to Washington from the Middle East.Moscow has previously warned Washington against providing long-range missiles to Kyiv, saying it would cause a major escalation in the conflict and strain US-Russian relations.Tomahawk missiles have a range of 2,500 km (1,500 miles), which would put Moscow within reach of Ukraine.Trump's attitude to Russia has hardened in recent months as he has become impatient with Vladimir Putin's lack of cooperation in reaching a ceasefire deal with Kyiv.  \"I might tell them [Russia] that if the war is not settled, that we may very well, [send Tomahawks to Kyiv] we may not, but we may do it,\" he said.\"Do they [Russia] want Tomahawks going in their direction? I don't think so,\" the US president added.On Sunday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the topic of Tomahawks was of \"extreme concern\" to Russia. \"Now is really a very dramatic moment in terms of the fact that tensions are escalating from all sides,\" he said.In September Peskov had dismissed the threat of Tomahawks, saying they would not be able to \"change the dynamic\" of the war.But in his comments on Sunday he noted that if Tomahawks were launched at Russia Moscow would not be able to tell whether they were carrying nuclear warheads. \"What should the Russian Federation think? Just how should Russia react?\", he said.Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev then doubled down on Peskov's comments. \"How should Russia respond? Exactly!\" Medvedev said on social media.\"The delivery of these missiles could end badly for everyone. And first of all – for Trump himself,\" he wrote.Medvedev, who over the last few years has grown into an increasingly hawkish figure, frequently posts on social media espousing more extreme positions than the Kremlin's. He and Trump have sparred online before. Comments by Medvedev in August led Trump to say he had ordered two nuclear submarines to move closer to Russia.Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, Kyiv has made multiple requests for long-range missiles, as it weighs up striking Russian cities far from the front lines of the grinding conflict.In their recent phone calls, Zelensky and Trump discussed Ukraine's bid to strengthen its military capabilities, including boosting its air defences and long-range arms. Ukrainian cities including Kyiv have repeatedly come under heavy Russian bombardment with drones and missiles. Russia has particularly targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure as winter approaches, causing widespread power cuts. Last month, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg suggested the US president had authorised strikes deep into Russian territory, telling Fox News \"there are no such things as sanctuaries\" from attacks in the Russia-Ukraine war.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "The organisers of the Eurovision Song Contest have postponed a vote on whether Israel should be allowed to perform in next year's competition.The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said \"recent developments in the Middle East\" had prompted it to cancel the virtual meeting to vote on the matter, which was scheduled to take place in November.It said Israel's participation would instead be discussed at an in-person meeting in December, though it did not make clear whether a vote would still take place.Israel's participation in Eurovision has faced opposition from some other participating countries due to the war in Gaza.On Monday, all 20 living Israeli hostages were freed by Hamas in exchange for the return of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. It comes after a ceasefire came into force on Friday.Ceasefire live updates'You're my life, my hero': Hostages reunite with families after two yearsPalestinians celebrate return of detainees freed by IsraelIn a statement, the EBU said: \"In the light of recent developments in the Middle East, the EBU's executive board (meeting on October 13) agreed there was a clear need to organise an open and in-person discussion among its members on the issue of participation in the Eurovision Song Contest 2026.\"\"Consequently, the board agreed to put the issue on the agenda of its ordinary winter general assembly, which will be taking place in December, rather than organising an extraordinary session in advance,\" it added.The EBU announced last month it would invite 68 member countries to give their view on whether Israel should take part at a general assembly meeting in November.Austrian national broadcaster ORF, which will host the contest in 2026, said it welcomed the EBU's decision.It had previously urged countries not to boycott the contest next year in Vienna, with its Foreign Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger saying Eurovision and the arts in general are \"not the appropriate arenas for sanctions\". Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, Iceland and the Netherlands have all said they would consider boycotting next year's contest if Israel were to take part. Dutch broadcaster AvroTros said last month it would not change its position if a ceasefire in Gaza was reached. \"If a ceasefire is reached in the near future or the conflict develops differently, that will not change our position for 2026. We will reassess participation in subsequent years, depending on the circumstances at that time,\" it said in a statement. The BBC has asked Israel's national broadcaster, Kan, for comment.In September it said it should be allowed to take part, saying it was \"one of the contest's longstanding, popular and successful participants\". Israel came second in the the most recent Eurovision Song Contest in May, with its act Yuval Raphael receiving the largest combined public vote.However, the inclusion of jury votes led to Austria being declared the overall winner.",

    "body": "A Kenyan police officer stationed at one of the gates of the president's official residence in the capital, Nairobi, has died after being shot with an arrow, officials have said.Police said that on Monday morning, a 56-year-old man, armed with a bow and arrows, approached officers at the gate of State House and was ordered to surrender. Instead, he moved forward and shot PC Ramadhan Matanka in the ribs.The policeman was immediately taken to hospital but died while undergoing treatment, according to a police statement.The attack has raised questions about possible security lapses as State House is one of Kenya's most heavily guarded locations.PC Matanka's body is now in a mortuary and there will be a post-mortem later.An investigation is also under way to establish the motive behind the attack.Local media are reporting that the dead policeman had been among those screening vehicles entering State House.The alleged attacker, who had reportedly disguised himself as a homeless person carrying a sack concealing the weapons, was detained following the assault.Video footage, published by Kenyan television channel NTV later on Monday, showed a handcuffed man with visible injuries. He was in a police vehicle and was reportedly being taken to hospital for treatment.The man is expected to appear in court later on Tuesday, local media are reporting.\"The National Police Service condemns this heinous act and commends the officers for their swift response, which prevented further harm,\" police spokesperson Muchiri Nyaga said.He sent his condolences to the family of the dead policeman, noting that the officer had \"paid the ultimate price in the line of duty\".",

    "body": "1 day agoAna Faguyin Martinsburg, West VirginiaBBCTroy Williams, Marcellus Brothers and Jonathan GibaIt's been three months since Jonathan Giba moved into temporary housing for homeless veterans inside a hospital for former members of the US military in West Virginia.He has been waiting for medical and dental consultations, after medications he was previously prescribed left him without teeth and unable to walk. Now, with the government shut down, he is preparing to wait even longer.He calls it \"political bs\". The US Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital where Mr Giba is staying in Martinsburg, West Virginia, is still providing medical care, but the VA stopped other programs that help veterans find jobs and transition from military life.\"The shutdown is a waste of time, and it hurts everyone in the meantime,\" the Army veteran says.Martinsburg is an American town particularly fixed to feel the impacts of the US government shutdown. A city of nearly 20,000 people some 85 miles (136km) outside of Washington DC, federal agencies employ upwards of 3,300 people in the area, between the veterans' hospital, an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) processing facility and an agricultural assistance office. Another thousand or so federal workers commute to the nation's capital each day from the Amtrak station in Martinsburg's centre.This is Trump country, where 67% voted for the president in 2024 and a fierce independence undergirds something of a make-it-work mindset.  Because of the government shutdown, a nearby community event - the Freedom's Run Race Series - changed its route from trails near a federal Civil War battlefield site, but otherwise went on as planned. Harper's Ferry, a national park and nearby tourist draw, has been kept open with state money.But the political bickering in Washington and perceived lack of concern about everyday Americans are not far from people's minds. And they worry about what's coming as the shutdown drags on.On an unseasonably warm Monday nearly six days after the US government shut down, Mr Giba sits underneath the shade of a large tree chain-smoking cigarettes with fellow veterans. One of them, Troy Williams, says politics is hurting average Americans. \"This isn't a Democrat or Republican issue,\" he says, \"this is a why aren't they working on a solution issue.\"Air Force veteran Marcellus Brothers is concerned about what's ahead. \"We're in limbo, it's scary.\"What makes this US shutdown different (and more difficult)'No good outcome' - voters across US share concerns about shutdownTrump administration starts laying off thousands of workersRepublicans and Democrats have been deadlocked over government funding since it ran out on 1 October, and much of the government shut down, placing more than 700,000 people on unpaid leave. Some 200,000 other workers deemed \"essential\" are working without pay as the political standoff drags on.Politicians in Washington have pointed fingers in the direction of the opposing party. On Friday, the White House began laying off thousands of federal employees.In a state already hit by job cuts from the Trump administration's efforts to scale back the federal workforce, the shutdown threatens even steeper losses, Kelly Allen, the executive director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy warns.\"We have more federal government employees than coal miners in West Virginia,\" she says. \"Of course those jobs are well paying, come with good benefits and in a state with not a whole lot of good paying jobs those are really important.\"Tina Hissam, a small business employee in the area, has seen the impact of government shutdowns on her neighbours first hand. \"It hurts the small businesses, they may cancel services, they may not shop locally,\" she says of federal workers. \"The government shutdown has a huge impact and it's really scary, I just pray that it all goes away.\" Already, a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) service centre - which serves the seven surrounding counties - has shut its door. The office - responsible for assisting farmers, ranchers and landowners with tasks like applying for farm loans and disaster assistance - will remain closed until the government reopens. And on Wednesday, the IRS furloughed 34,000 workers, so the service centre in Martinsburg may soon be affected. History has shown that as shutdowns go on, more services are cut or shuttered because of a lack of funding.West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito has so far remained unbowed despite the potential impact on areas she represents like Martinsburg. She has voted with fellow Republicans to provide government funding without healthcare subsidies that Democrats want. Both sides' proposals have repeatedly failed.In a local op-ed, Moore Capito noted West Virginia has the third-highest number of federal employees per capita in the country, but blamed Democrats' intransigence.\"These are our neighbours and friends - people who keep our miners safe, process veterans' benefits, secure our borders, and keep drugs out of our communities. They're now facing uncertainty about their pay cheques through no fault of their own.\"When the first cheques since the shutdown arrive - or don't - on Friday that impact may finally hit.In previous shutdowns, federal workers who went without pay were given back pay, but it remains unclear if that will be the case this time around.\"The economic loss could have wide-ranging consequences on local communities, businesses and households. It could cause long-term damage to local economies,\" resident Mark Mulligan says.\"West Virginia is a poor state and dependent on federal jobs and handouts. The pain to the elderly, the disabled and to children could be catastrophic. \"",

    "body": "11 hours agoJames FitzGerald andBrandon DrenonUS President Donald Trump and the leaders of Egypt, Qatar and Turkey have signed a declaration for bringing peace to Gaza at a summit in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el- Sheikh.\"A new and beautiful day is rising and now the rebuilding begins,\" said Trump, praising regional leaders who helped cement the truce between Israel and Hamas.Earlier, in his address to the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, the president told cheering lawmakers that \"the long and painful nightmare is finally over\". Israel is releasing 250 Palestinian prisoners and more than 1,700 other Palestinians detained during the two-year military operations in Gaza in exchange for the last 20 living Israeli hostages held by Hamas.The exchange, the first phase of Trump's peace plan, is also due to include the return of the bodies of 28 dead Israeli hostages.In Egypt, Trump was all smiles in the company of Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi and more than 20 other leaders from around the world.\"Everybody's happy,\" Trump said, adding that he had done \"big deals before\" but \"this has taken off like a rocket ship\". \"This took 3,000 years to get to this point, can you believe it? And it's going to hold up too,\" he said. After the ceremony, President al-Sisi awarded Trump the Order of the Nile, a necklace made of pure gold considered to be Egypt's highest honour.The Egyptian president called the day a \"historic milestone that ends an agonising chapter\".Among the many world leaders at the summit who stood for a photo opportunity with Trump was Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who less than a week ago was blocked by the US from attending the UN General Assembly in New York.Although the first phase of the ceasefire agreement has been enacted, there is a lingering question over what role the Palestinian Authority might eventually play in Gaza.Trump said the second phase of negotiations on a peace agreement were under way.During his address to the Knesset, the American president suggested the region was experiencing \"the historic dawn of a new Middle East\". His words echoed the phrasing he used when Israel signed landmark deals with several Arab states during his first presidency.\"At last, not only for Israelis but also Palestinians, the long and painful nightmare is finally over,\" Trump told the Israeli parliament.Adding to the jubilant atmosphere in the room were politicians' chants of \"Trump, Trump, Trump\". The ceasefire that he helped to broker was \"the most challenging breakthrough of them all, the most challenging breakthrough maybe ever\", the US leader reflected. He indicated that ending the Russia-Ukraine war would be his next focus.Trump gave an insight into some of his recent conversations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying he felt the Israeli military campaign in Gaza was becoming \"bad\" and \"heated\".\"I said, 'Bibi you're going to be remembered for this far more than if you kept this thing going, going, going, kill, kill, kill',\" Trump recalled.Introducing Trump to parliament, Netanyahu called the US president the \"greatest friend\" Israel had ever had in the White House. \"Everything changed\" in the American attitude to Israel's military campaign in Gaza when Trump was re-elected as US president last year, he said.The Israeli prime minister thanked Trump for his \"unremitting help\" in securing the return of the remaining hostages - part of a group of 251 people seized during the 7 October 2023 attacks in southern Israel by Hamas.Trump went on to offer a tribute of his own to his counterpart, saying: \"He's not the easiest guy to deal with, but that's what makes him great.\"Also welcomed to the Knesset alongside Trump were other key US officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. The names of Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner received particularly loud cheers from Israeli MPs, for their own roles in brokering the ceasefire. Kushner was accompanied by his wife Ivanka Trump.Members of Trump's audience wore red caps. Instead of Trump's signature slogan \"Make America Great Again\", they read \"Trump the Peace President\".Trump was told by the parliamentary speaker that there was \"no-one\" more deserving of next year's Nobel Peace Prize.Some Israeli lawmakers who want the war in Gaza to continue did not attend.Trump's speech was briefly interrupted as an opposition parliament member held up a piece of paper that said \"Recognise Palestine\". At least one person was escorted out of the room.The ceasefire in Gaza took effect on Friday morning after Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of Trump's 20-point peace plan. The next phases are still to be negotiated.Trump has said the ceasefire will hold, and that a \"board of peace\" he is due to head would quickly be set up to administer the territory.",

    "body": "22 minutes agoNatasha Booty andSammy AwamiBBC Africa, AntananarivoMadagascar's embattled President Andry Rajoelina has said he is sheltering in a \"safe place\" after an attempt on his life, following weeks of protests calling for him to quit.In a live broadcast to the nation on Facebook, Rajoelina, 51, said \"a group of military personnel and politicians planned to assassinate me\".He did not reveal his location, but unconfirmed reports earlier suggested that he had fled the country on a French military aircraft.It follows a fortnight of nationwide protests, mainly led by young demonstrators, aimed at kicking him out of power.Rajoelina's failed attempts to placate the young protesters - dubbed \"Gen Z Mada\" - saw the president sack his entire government and make other concessions to no avail.He has not been seen since Wednesday, and at the weekend Rajoelina's office said an attempt was under way to force him from power. His address to the nation was delayed several times on Monday amid the chaos, as soldiers threatened to seize the state TV headquarters in the Indian Ocean island.Eventually, in the Facebook broadcast he said: \"Since 25 September, there have been attempts on my life and coup attempts. A group of military personnel and politicians planned to assassinate me.\"I was forced to find a safe place to protect my life.\"\"There is only one way to resolve these issues; that is to respect the constitution in force in the country\".Over the weekend, CAPSAT, a powerful army unit that helped install Rajoelina into power in 2009 moved to undermine him by declaring itself in command of all the armed forces, while some of its officers joined protesters on the streets of the capital, Antananarivo.Following a meeting of military commanders on Monday, the new Chief of Army Staff installed by CAPSAT, Gen Demosthene Pikulas, assured the public that the security forces were working together to maintain order in the island nation.By Monday evening, the general was at state TV headquarters trying to resolve the crisis, according to a statement from the presidency.Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior leader in Madagascar's largest opposition party, TIM, told the BBC that Madagascar was now effectively being run by the army unit. The TIM party has also said that it plans to bring impeachment proceedings against Rajoelina for \"abandonment of post\".As it happened: How a day of drama unfolded in MadagascarFrance's President Emmanuel Macron refused on Monday to confirm Rajoelina had been evacuated by a French military aircraft. However, he said the  \"constitutional order\" must be preserved in Madagascar.\"We have a youth that has expressed itself, that is politicised, that wants to live better and that is a very good thing,\" Macron told reporters in Egypt. \"We just need to make sure that it is not taken over by military factions or foreign interference.\"The head of the African Union's security council expressed similar concerns, saying the organisation firmly rejected any \"unconstitutional change of government\".Several of Rajoelina's inner circle have fled to nearby Mauritius. They include former Prime Minister Christian Ntsay and the businessman Maminiaina Ravatomanga.Despite its abundant natural resources, Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world. About 75% of people there live below the poverty line, the World Bank says, while data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) shows just over one-third of people have access to electricity.The protests began over anger with repeated water and power cuts, then escalated to reflect wider dissatisfaction with Rajoelina's government over high unemployment, corruption and the cost-of-living crisis.At least 22 people were killed and more than 100 injured in the first few days of the protests, according to the UN, although the government has rejected these figures. Eyewitnesses describe security officers opening fire on protesters with live ammunition. In one case, a newborn baby died from smoke inhalation after being exposed to tear gas.Madagascar has been rocked by multiple uprisings since it gained independence in 1960, including mass protests in 2009 that forced then-President Marc Ravalomanana to step down and saw Rajoelina ushered into office.Aged just 34 at the time, Rajoelina became Africa's youngest leader - going on to govern for four years, then returning to power again after the 2018 election.Rajoelina was born into wealth and, before entering politics, had made a name for himself as an entrepreneur and DJ - setting up a radio station and an advertising company along the way.But his sharp-suited, baby-faced appeal soon waned, as allegations of cronyism and entrenched corruption became unshakeable.",

    "body": "3 hours agoNatalie Shermanbusiness reporterJanani Mohan/Yagappa PhotographyJanani Mohan is missing a sari she wore at her wedding in April, which was also worn by her motherGraduate student Nicole Lobo moved back to the US in late August after a year in the UK, shipping 10 boxes of possessions back home to Philadelphia that she expected to arrive within a few days. Six weeks later, she is still waiting for the shipment - and fears it is lost, destroyed by UPS as the company struggles to handle a flood of packages facing new customs and tariff rules. \"It's been horrific,\" says the 28-year-old, who was notified last month that her boxes would be disposed of, leaving her to make frantic phone calls and send emails to try to head off the outcome. It's an ordeal facing many UPS customers since the Trump administration in late August stopped allowing parcels worth less than $800 to enter the US without inspection, taxes or tariffs.The decision abruptly made an estimated 4 million packages each day subject to new, more onerous processing and documentation rules.As the influx leads to longer processing times and higher, sometimes unexpected, costs across the industry, some customers of UPS like Nicole, say they fear their packages have been lost in the backlog. \"It's beyond comprehension to me,\" says Janani Mohan, a 29-year-old engineer living in Michigan, who has also spent hours on hold and sent repeated emails since a tracking alert listed a box sent by her parents in India as set for disposal.The parcel held her wedding dress, which had also been worn by her mother, an heirloom sari from her grandmother and wedding photos, among other items. \"I literally cried to them on the phone,\" she says. \"Everything in there is very close to my heart.\"Oregon-based Mizuba Tea Co, which has used UPS for more than a decade to import matcha from Japan, has five shipments together worth more than $100,000 held up in processing.The firm has received conflicting alerts about their status, including some saying the items were set for disposal. \"My whole team is basically on scan watch,\" says Lauren Purvis, who runs the business with her family and is now starting to worry about running out of inventory if the limbo continues. \"It's just clear to us that the current importing systems were not prepared to handle the sheer amount of volume and paperwork.\"Mizuba TeaLauren Purvis says her whole team is on \"scan watch\"Importers typically have 10 days after goods enter the US to submit documentation about the goods, pay tariffs and other fees, allowing the package to go to its recipient. But the Trump administration's rapid changes to tariff rules have made it increasingly difficult to meet customs deadlines requirements, say shipping companies like FedEx and UPS, which offer customs services and often act as importers of record.For example, businesses are now responsible for paying tariffs on any steel or aluminium contained in a product , and in many cases vouching for its country of origin - information that many businesses, let alone their shipping companies, do not know. \"Because of changes to US import regulations, we are seeing many packages that are unable to clear customs due to missing or incomplete information about the shipment required for customs clearance,\" a UPS spokeswoman said. While acknowledging longer shipping times, the company said it was still successfully clearing more than 90% of international packages within a day of arrival. The spokeswoman said its policy was to contact customers three times before moving to dispose of a package. But seven people interviewed by the BBC, including several businesses responsible for shipping the items, said they had received no word from UPS about issues before seeing the tracking alert that their package would be trashed.FedEx, another major player in the industry, said it does not typically destroy packages, unless directed to do so by the shipper. Nicole, the graduate student, says she has been asked to supply more information about her items, which she did promptly in early September.  She did not hear more until seeing the notice about disposal in late September. After the BBC enquired about her package, the tracking information was updated for the first time in weeks to say it was \"on the way\", raising her hopes. Likewise, Janani says the company reached out last week, after the BBC got in touch, for a few more documents and her package now appears to have cleared customs.Swedish Candy LandDaniel and Tobias Johansson, co-founders of Swedish Candy Land, say lost packages have cost their company $50,000But for businesses, the chaos has already had real costs. Swedish candy exporter Swedish Candy Land says more than 700 packages it sent via UPS to customers in the US in the first few weeks of September have been held up.Co-founder Tobias Johansson says the business switched to FedEx after becoming aware of the problem and its shipments were now arriving without incident, although the process took a few days longer than before . But the lost packages, some of which have been reported destroyed, have cost the firm roughly $50,000 in refunds, not including the expenses they incurred in shipping and brokerage fees. \"That was a big hit for us and we haven't gotten any answers yet for anything,\" says Mr Johansson.Experts say the ripple effects are being felt across the supply chain, even on businesses, like Mizuba, that were not bringing in shipments using the $800 exemption from tariffs, known as de minimis.  \"This can be felt pretty much across the board,\" says Bernie Hart, vice president of business development at Flexport, a logistics and customs business. In a call with financial analysts last month, FedEx executives said it had been a \"very stressful period\" for its customers, especially smaller players. \"That is a big headwind,\" chief executive Raj Subramanian said, warning that changes to the trade environment would likely lead to a $1bn hit this year, including $300m in additional expenses as the firm hires and faces other costs related to the new rules. But John Pickel, vice president of supply chain policy for the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents many shipping firms, fears the issues may get worse before they get better. Overall trade volumes last month were lower than is typical, in part because many businesses rushed goods into the US early to beat tariffs. \"There's always been this prevailing thought that companies will figure it out,\" he says. \"What we've seen is that is much harder than anyone anticipated.\"",

    "body": "22 hours agoGeeta PandeyBBC News, DelhiIt's often said that a picture can speak a thousand words. The one in Indian newspapers on Monday morning showing female journalists occupying front-row seats at the Afghan Taliban foreign minister's press conference in Delhi is certainly one of those.The conference - the second press event by Amir Khan Muttaqi at the Afghan embassy in about 48 hours - was called after a huge uproar over the exclusion of women from his first meeting on Friday.Muttaqi said at Sunday's conference that the exclusion was unintentional and not \"deliberate\".\"With regard to the [Friday's] press conference, it was on short notice and a short list of journalists was decided, and the participation list that was presented was very specific. \"It was more a technical issue... Our colleagues had decided to send an invitation to a specific list of journalists and there was no other intention apart from this,\" he added.The UN has referred to the situation in Afghanistan as \"gender apartheid\" where women and girls are not allowed to attend secondary school or university, visit parks or gyms. The jobs they are allowed to do are increasingly restricted and the Taliban government enforces head-to-toe coverings and restricts their travel.The Taliban government, which retook power in 2021, has previously said it respects women's rights in accordance with their interpretation of Afghan culture and Islamic law, but Western diplomats have said their attempts to gain recognition have been hampered by the curbs on women. The suppression of women's rights under their rule is the harshest in the world.Muttaqi arrived in India on Thursday for a week of high-level talks with the government from Russia, the only country so far to fully recognise their government.Delhi has not formally recognised Afghanistan's de facto rulers, but it is one of a number of countries that maintain some form of diplomatic or informal relations with them, even maintaining a small mission in Kabul and sending humanitarian aid there. The visit is being seen as a ramping up of relations between the countries and is key for both - the Taliban government receives a boost in its quest for recognition, while India advances its strategic and security interests. On Friday, Muttaqi met Foreign Minister S Jaishankar who announced that India would reopen its embassy in Kabul which was shut after the Taliban returned to power in 2021.The press event later in the day was attended by around 16 male reporters while female journalists were turned away from the embassy gates.A source in the Taliban government had admitted women had not been invited to attend.India's Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said it \"had no involvement in the press interaction\" as it was held at the Afghan embassy.But the gender discrimination on Indian soil angered politicians and journalists who criticised the government for letting it happen.Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said that by allowing the event to go ahead, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi was \"telling every woman in India that you are too weak to stand up for them\".The Editors Guild of India, the Indian Women's Press Corps (IWPC) and the Network of Women in Media, India (NWMI), issued strong statements, calling the exclusion \"highly discriminatory\".\"While diplomatic premises may claim protection under the Vienna Convention, that cannot justify blatant gender discrimination in press access on Indian soil,\" the Guild said.\"Whether or not the MEA co-ordinated the event, it is deeply troubling that such a discriminatory exclusion was allowed to proceed without objection,\" it added.The NWMI said it was the Indian government's \"responsibility to uphold the democratic rights and constitutional freedoms of female citizens, including their right to work and  livelihood\" and that they should have questioned such \"blatant gender discrimination\".The group also criticised male journalists who attended Friday's conference for not standing up for their female colleagues. \"In moments like these, silence can be seen as complicity in normalising gender discrimination,\" the statement said.Amid growing outrage in India, Muttaqi's team sent out fresh invitations for Sunday's interaction, describing it as an \"inclusive\" event open to all media personnel. It's not clear what led to the second press meet - though there is no official confirmation, there has been some speculation that the Indian government may have intervened.The conference was well attended and the minister was asked some hard-hitting questions about the reason for keeping out women from Friday's meeting - and the rights of Afghan girls and women.\"We have 10 million students in schools and institutes, including over 2.8 million women and girls. In madrassas, education continues up to graduation,\" Muttaqi responded. \"Some limits exist, but we've never declared women's education religiously haram [forbidden], it's only postponed until further order,\" he said.Many journalists who attended the press conference questioned the minister's claim, pointing out the restrictions the Taliban have imposed on girls and women since 2021.Over the past four years, girls over the age of 12 were banned from getting an education and job options for women have been severely restricted. In recent weeks, the Taliban government also removed books written by women from universities in Afghanistan.The minister's response to follow-up questions on women's rights in Afghanistan may not have been satisfactory. But, as some journalists pointed out, the very fact that the second press conference was organised and that the minister took questions on gender issues can be seen as progress. ",

    "body": "1 day agoJane ChambersBusiness reporter, Asunción, ParaguayGabriela CibilsGabriela Cibils wants to help Paraguay attract big tech from the US and elsewhereGabriela Cibils is on a mission – to help turn Paraguay into the Silicon Valley of South America.When she was growing up in the landlocked country, nestled between Brazil and Argentina, she says the nation \"wasn't super tech focused\".But it was different for Ms Cibils, as her parents worked in the technology sector. And she was inspired to study in the US, where she got a degree in computing and neuroscience from the University of California, Berkeley.After graduating she spent eight years working in Silicon Valley, near San Francisco, with roles at various American start-ups.But rather than staying permanently in the US, a few years ago she decided to return home to Paraguay. She's now helping to lead efforts to build a large and successful tech sector that puts the country of seven million people on the world map - and attract some of the globe's tech giants.AFP via Getty ImagesThe giant Itaipu Dam produces 90% of Paraguay's electricity needs\"I saw first hand the impact that technology can have on your life,\" says Ms Cibils. \"After being exposed to such a different world [in Silicon Valley], it's my responsibility to bring that mindset back and combine it with the talent I see in Paraguay.\"She is now a partner at global technology and investment firm Cibersons, whose headquarters is in Paraguay's capital Asunción.While most countries would love to build a world-class tech sector, Paraguay has a distinct advantage in one regard – an abundance of cheap, green electricity.This is thanks to 100% of its generation now coming from hydroelectric power.This is centred on the giant Itaipu Dam on the Paraná River, which forms part of the border between Paraguay and Brazil. This huge hydroelectric power station, the largest in the world outside of China, supplies 90% of Paraguay's electricity needs, and 10% of Brazil's.In fact, such is Paraguay's surplus of electricity that its electricity prices are the lowest in South America.And it is the world's largest exporter of clean energy.The Paraguayan government hopes that the country's abundance of cheap, green electricity will attract global tech firms increasingly focused on the massive energy demands of AI computing.\"If you want to install any technology investment like AI data centres, keep in mind hydroelectric power is both renewable and steady,\" says Paraguayan software development entrepreneur Sebastian Ortiz-Chamorro.\"Compared to other renewable energy sources like wind or solar, that have their ups and downs, it's much more attractive for creating data centres or any other electro intensive activity that requires a steady electricity source.\"He adds that in addition to Itaipu, and Paraguay's other large state-owned hydroelectric plant, the Yacyretá Dam, private companies can easily build their own smaller facilities.On a visit to California last year Paraguay's President Santiago Peña spoke with companies like Google and OpenAI to encourage them to invest in Paraguay. It remains to be seen if such industry giants open large operations in the country.Minister of Technology and Communication Gustavo Villate is working closely with the president on the continuing efforts.\"We have the youngest population. We have a lot of renewable green energy. We have low taxes and economic stability,\" he says proudly.I'm taken on a tour with the minister of a planned new digital park near Asunción's main airport. It's currently green fields and some army barracks.Mr Villate unfurls plans to show off the lakes, a childcare centre and other buildings which he says should be ready in under two years.\"The government are going to invest around $20m (£15m) for the first stage, but the idea is for private companies to invest the rest,\" he says.Even though the park isn't ready yet, Mr Villate says the collaboration already happening between the public, private and university sectors is key to building an ecosystem to attract foreign investors.The government thinks the country's young population will be a key attraction, and able to provide a large tech workforce. The average age in Paraguay is 27.Vanessa CañeteVanessa Cañete says Paraguay is working hard to train more young people in technologyBut more young people will need to be trained. The technology minister says the new digital park will also be home to The University of Technology, which is a joint venture between Taiwan and Paraguay.Meanwhile, there are other initiatives to train young people in the country. \"We are working really hard to create a mass of software engineers, programmers and everything you need to provide software services,\" says Vanessa Cañete, president of trade group Paraguayan Chamber of the Software Industry.Ms Cañete says she is also passionate about encouraging more women to study computer engineering. In 2017 she set up Girls Code, a non-profit association which aims to close the tech gender gap.It organises programming and robotics workshops for teenagers and young women,  with more than 1,000 receiving some sort of training to date.Ms Cañete adds that software developers are also given English lessons for up to four years to improve their communication with overseas firms.The people I met are brimming with positivity about what Paraguay has to offer the tech world, but they are also pragmatic.Ms Cibils says there are still \"growing pains\" for foreign investors, with issues like bureaucracy, which can hold things up adapting local contracts to standardised international ones.But she is adamant that \"if you put innovation at its core and leverage all the benefits that the country has I think Paraguay can be a superpower\".",

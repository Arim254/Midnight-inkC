    "body": "France's consumer watchdog has reported fast fashion giant Shein to authorities for selling \"sex dolls with a childlike appearance\" on its website. The Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) said in a statement that the online description and categorisation of the dolls \"makes it difficult to doubt the child pornography nature of the content\", French media reported.Shein told the BBC: \"The products in question were immediately delisted as soon as we became aware of these serious issues.\" It said its team was \"investigating how these listings circumvented our screening measures\".Shein is also \"conducting a comprehensive review to identify and remove any similar items that may be listed on our marketplace by other third-party vendors\".The DGCCRF has reported Shein to French prosecutors as well as Arcom, the country's online and broadcasting regulator, according to French media.The news has emerged just days before Shein is set to open its first permanent physical shop anywhere in the world - in a Parisian department store.The decision to allow Shein to open at BHV Marais, a shop in France's capital city that traces its roots back to 1856, has provoked controversy. The company has faced criticism for its labour practices and environmental record.Shein will open at BHV on Wednesday ahead of other shops across France, all owned by property firm Société des Grands Magasins.Commenting on the dolls sold on Shein's site, France's consumer watchdog warned that \"the dissemination, via an electronic communications network, of child pornography is punishable by up to seven years' imprisonment and a fine of €100,000 (£88,000)\".Shein said it \"maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any content or products that violate our platform policies or applicable laws\".A spokesperson said the fast fashion firm is taking the matter \"extremely seriously\".\"We are taking immediate corrective actions and reinforcing our internal controls to prevent this from happening again,\" they said. Shein has already been fined millions of euros in recent months.In September, France's data protection authority, the Commission Nationale de L'informatique et des Libertés, imposed a €150m (£132m) penalty on Shein for failing to get users' consent to allow \"cookies\" which collect information about people visiting a website.  Shein is contesting the fine, which it called \"wholly disproportionate\" and \"politically motivated\".",

    "body": "US airports have been hit with widespread delays because of a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are working without pay during the federal government shutdown.A ground stop was issued at Newark Airport on Sunday morning, a major hub servicing New York. Average delays at Newark are more than three hours and could last until Monday, the Federal Aviation Administration says.Half of the 30 major airports in the US have staff shortages, and Transport Secretary Sean Duffy said flights will be cancelled across national airspace \"to make sure people are safe\".Nearly 13,000 air traffic controllers are working without pay as the government shutdown enters its second month.Air traffic controllers, like other essential federal workers, are required to work without pay during the shutdown, including Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents.  The aviation agency called on lawmakers to end the shutdown so that workers \"receive the pay they've earned and travelers can avoid further disruptions and delays\". The FAA said the shortages means it has had to reduce the flow of air traffic \"to maintain safety\". \"This may result in delays or cancellations,\" it added.On Saturday, about 4,500 flights within the US were delayed and more than 500 were cancelled, according to FlightAware. In New York, the largest US city, about 80% of air traffic controllers were absent heading into the weekend, according to the FAA.Transportation Secretary Duffy on Sunday told ABC the aviation agency would take any steps necessary to make sure travellers are safe.\"But there is a level of risk that gets injected into the system when we have a controller that's doing two jobs instead of one,\" he said.He added that air traffic controllers were under a great deal of stress and working without pay.\"They don't make a lot of money, and so they may be the only person that is bringing money into the household,\" he said.\"They have to make a decision, do I go to work and not get a paycheque and not put food on the table? Or do I drive for Uber or DoorDash or wait tables?\"Lawmakers are at an impasse as a Republican-led bill to fund the government has failed to pass the Senate over a dozen times.In exchange for re-opening the government, Democrats are seeking to extend tax credits that make health insurance cheaper for millions of Americans.They are also calling for a reverse to US President Donald Trump's cuts to Medicaid, a government healthcare programme used by millions of elderly, disabled and low-income people.",

    "body": "The number of people killed in Jamaica as a result of Hurricane Melissa has risen to 28, the Caribbean nation's prime minister has announced.Andrew Holness confirmed nine other deaths on Saturday, adding that there were reports of possible fatalities still being verified - suggesting the figure may yet rise.Emergency responders and aid agencies have struggled to reach certain parts of the island in the aftermath of the storm due to blocked roads, debris and flooding.The category five hurricane - the strongest type - has caused dozens of deaths across the Caribbean, bringing powerful winds and landslides to Cuba and Haiti.The full scale of the destruction Melissa wrought on Jamaica has only become clear in the past few days as the hurricane knocked out communication systems and power to much of the island after it made landfall on Tuesday.Communities on the island's western portion, such as Black River and Montego Bay, have seen the worst of the destruction.Images have emerged showing buildings razed to the ground, debris and belongings strewn on streets, and whole neighbourhoods still under floodwater.The Red Cross says that 72% of people across Jamaica still do not have electricity and around 6,000 are in emergency shelters.Jamaican officials confirmed to news agency AFP that multiple field hospitals were being established to treat people in the worst-affected areas in the west.Aid reaching those in need was initially held up by the temporary closure of Jamaica's airports. Now that it is arriving in the country, landslides, downed power lines and fallen trees have made certain roads impassable - complicating its distribution.With so many in need of clean drinking water, food and medicine, there have been reports of desperate people entering supermarkets and pharmacies to gather what they can.Melissa has become the most powerful storm on record to hit Jamaica, and one of the strongest seen in the Caribbean.At its peak, the hurricane had sustained winds of 185mph (295 km/h). A category five hurricane - those capable of catastrophic damage - has winds in excess of 157mph.At least 31 people have been killed in Haiti as a result of Melissa, while at least two deaths have been reported in the Dominican Republic.In Cuba, thousands of people have been evacuated as more than 60,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed.The impact of climate change on the frequency of storms is still unclear, but increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above and make more energy available to drive hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons. As a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall.Ahead of the start of this year's Atlantic hurricane season, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted above-normal activity.",

    "body": "Three men have been killed in a US strike on an alleged drug-smuggling boat in the Caribbean, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has said. It is the latest in a series of attacks on vessels the Trump administration says are being used to smuggle drugs into the US.Since they began in September, experts have questioned the legality of the strikes under international law, which have drawn strong criticism from Latin American leaders whose citizens have been targeted.Combatting the flow of illegal drugs is a key policy for US President Donald Trump - but some have suggested the strikes are part of efforts to influence politically opposed governments in the region.Hegseth said the boat targeted on Saturday was operated by a designated terrorist organisation - without specifying which one - and had been travelling in international waters when it was hit.The vessel was travelling along a known drug-smuggling route and carrying narcotics, he said, without providing evidence.Hegseth's statement late on Saturday was accompanied by a video that appears to show a blurred-out boat travelling through the water before exploding.Announcements of these strikes are usually accompanied with grainy footage but no evidence of the alleged drug trafficking and few details about who or what was on board each vessel.The Trump administration has previously said that some boats targeted had departed from Venezuela.The Trump administration has insisted that it was targeting \"narco-terrorists\".The BBC's US partner, CBS News, reported that at least 64 people have been killed by American airstrikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific since early September. Colombian President Gustavo Petro has previously described the attacks as \"murder\" and said they were being used by the US to \"dominate\" Latin America.Meanwhile, Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro accused Washington of \"fabricating a war\".The two left-wing leaders have increasingly been at odds with the Trump administration. Following Petro's comments, the US placed sanctions on him and his inner circle, as well as removing Colombia's certification as an ally in the war on drugs. Trump has threatened military action against land targets in Venezuela.But this, he has admitted, may require the consent of the US Congress.However, some US lawmakers, both Democrat and Republican, have said the strikes on vessels also required congressional approval - something Trump has denied. Others have questioned whether the lethal strikes were legal at all.The UN's human rights chief Volker Turk said on Friday that such attacks were a violation of international human rights law. \"Over 60 people have reportedly been killed in a continuing series of attacks carried out by US armed forces... in circumstances that find no justification in international law,\" he said. \"These attacks – and their mounting human cost – are unacceptable.\"Experts in Latin American politics have suggested the strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific were part of a suite of measures designed to influence change in Colombia and Venezuela.The US is among many nations that consider Maduro's election last year as illegitimate, while Trump has been critical of Petro's policies on combatting the drug trade in his country, which has traditionally been a US ally.Washington has steadily been building up a force of warships, fighter jets, marines, spy planes, bombers and drones in the Caribbean over the past few months, which it has framed as part of a crackdown on drug-trafficking but which military analysts say is much larger than what is needed.",

    "body": "1 hour agoAoife Walsh,Washington and George WrightDonald Trump has played down the possibility of a US war with Venezuela, but suggested Nicolás Maduro's days as the country's president are numbered.Asked if the US was going to war against Venezuela, the US president told CBS' 60 Minutes: \"I doubt it. I don't think so. But they've been treating us very badly.\"His comments come as the US continues to launch strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean. The Trump administration says the strikes are necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the US.Trump rejected suggestions that the US action was not about stopping narcotics, but aimed at ousting Maduro, a long-time Trump opponent, saying it was about \"many things\". At least 64 people have been killed by US strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific since early September, CBS News - the BBC's US news partner - reported. Speaking from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, Trump said: \"Every single boat that you see that's shot down kills 25,000 on drugs and destroys families all over our country.\"Pushed on whether the US was planning any strikes on land, Trump refused to rule it out, saying: \"I wouldn't be inclined to say that I would do that... I'm not gonna tell you what I'm gonna do with Venezuela, if I was gonna do it or if I wasn't going to do it.\"Maduro has previously accused Washington of \"fabricating a new war\", while Colombian President Gustavo Petro has said the strikes on boats are being used by the US to \"dominate\" Latin America.Trump said the government was \"not going to allow\" people \"from all over the world\" to come in. \"They come in from the Congo, they come in from all over the world, they're coming, not just from South America. But Venezuela in particular - has been bad. They have gangs,\" he said, singling out Tren de Aragua. He called it \"the most vicious gang anywhere in the world\".President Trump was also asked about nuclear testing, after he called on US military leaders to resume testing nuclear weapons in order to keep pace with other countries such as Russia and China.Asked by CBS's Norah O'Donnell if he planned for the US to detonate a nuclear weapon for the first time in more than 30 years, Trump said: \"I'm saying that we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes.\"He added: \"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it.\"Russia and China have not carried out such tests since 1990 and 1996 respectively.Pressed further on the topic, Trump said: \"They don't go and tell you about it.\"\"I don't want to be the only country that doesn't test,\" he said, adding North Korea and Pakistan to the list of nations allegedly testing their arsenals.Also on Sunday, Trump's energy secretary downplayed the idea that the US was planning to set off a nuclear explosion.Chris Wright said any tests would be \"non-critical explosions\" on \"other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry and they set up the nuclear explosion\".During the interview, Trump also spoke about the US government shutdown, which has gone on for more than a month and left millions of Americans facing the loss of essential services.The president blamed Democrats, calling them \"crazed lunatics\" who have \"lost their way\" - but said he believed they will eventually capitulate and vote to end the shutdown.\"And if they don't vote, that's their problem,\" he said.It was Trump's first interview with CBS since he sued its parent company, Paramount, over a 2024 interview with then Vice-President Kamala Harris.He claimed the interview - which aired as part of the presidential election campaign - had been edited to \"tip the scales in favour of the Democratic Party\".Paramount agreed to pay $16m (£13.5m) to settle the suit, but with the money allocated to Trump's future presidential library, not paid to him \"directly or indirectly\". It said the settlement did not include a statement of apology.Trump last appeared on the 60 Minutes programme in 2020, when he walked out of an interview with Lesley Stahl because he claimed the questions were biased. He did not agree to an interview with the show during the 2024 election.",

    "body": "12 hours agoFrank Gardnersecurity correspondent, in BahrainNato \"will stand with Ukraine up to the day in which we will have them sitting around the table for a long-lasting peace\", a senior official from the military alliance has told the BBC.Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, chair of Nato's military committee since January, added from an operational point of view he considered the Russia-Ukraine war was bogged down, and \"it was almost time to sit and talk because it's a waste of lives\".Pointing to the fact that Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 had resulted in two more countries joining the Western alliance - Finland and Sweden - Adm Dragone described the war as a strategic failure for Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite recent slow, incremental advances by Russia on the battlefield. \"They will not get a friendly or puppet government like in Belarus. Putin will not succeed.\"Asked if European nations were prepared to keep going with supporting Ukraine's defence, he said they were. It was beneficial, he believed that they had had something of a wake-up call and were now taking charge of their own defence.In June, Nato members agreed to raise their defence spending to 5% of GDP by 2035. The move followed repeated urges from US President Donald Trump for members to do so.On Russia's recent announcement about long-range, nuclear-powered weapons like the Burevestnik and the Poseidon, the former Italian chief of defence staff and naval aviator played down concerns by Nato, saying that it was a defensive nuclear alliance. \"We are not threatened by them,\" he said, \"we are just ready to defend our 32 nations and our one billion people. We are a nuclear alliance.\"On the risk of future invasions or attacks, Adm Dragone said if - and he emphasised the conditional here - there was to be anywhere it would likely be the Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. But he pointed out that as Nato states Article 5 would be requested - which considers an attack on one nation to be equivalent to an attack on all - and that Nato would come to their defence. Asked if that included the US, he replied: \"Yes, because they have committed to this and they have underlined that they are still in the business.\"Of all Nato defence needs right now, Adm Dragone said air defence was the top priority. Recent incursions by Russian drones into Poland and Romania have prompted the alliance to upgrade its air defences. Regarding the possibility of activating a notional \"drone wall\" on Nato's eastern borders, he said this would be done within months and that \"the alliance's Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk [Virginia] is already working on that\".\"There is a lot of stuff on the market which will fulfil our immediate needs so we set up a new activity which is Eastern Sentry... integrating all the air defence that we already have on our eastern flank. \"Airspace incursions are pretty frequent, we escort them out and that's basically the game,\" the admiral said.Despite no sign that Russia is changing course on the war in Ukraine and despite signs that some members - notably Slovakia and Hungary - are increasingly opposed to supporting Ukraine's defence, Adm Dragone ended on a positive note. \"The alliance is reliable, it is mature, there is a cohesion which is our centre of gravity.\"\"The alliance is stronger than our adversaries, and we will stay with Ukraine up to the day that peace will break out,\" he added.",

    "body": "16 hours agoJaroslav LukivReutersLast month's jewellery heist at the Louvre museum was carried out by petty criminals rather than organised crime professionals, Paris's prosecutor has said.\"This is not quite everyday delinquency... but it is a type of delinquency that we do not generally associate with the upper echelons of organised crime,\" Laure Beccuau told franceinfo radio.She said four people arrested and charged so far over the theft that shocked France and the world were \"clearly local people\" living in Seine-Saint-Denis, an impoverished area just north of Paris. Jewels worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the most-visited museum, in the French capital, on 19 October.Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen A tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenIn Sunday's interview to franceinfo radio, Beccuau said the four arrested people - three men and a woman - \"all live more or less in Seine-Saint-Denis\".She said two of the male suspects had been known to the police, as they each had multiple theft convictions.On Saturday, a 38-year-old woman was charged with complicity in organised theft and criminal conspiracy with a view to committing a crime.Separately, a man, aged 37, was charged with theft and criminal conspiracy.The suspects - who have not been publicly named - both denied any involvement.Beccuau said the two were in a relationship and had children together, without giving any further details.Two men who had previously been arrested were already charged with theft and criminal conspiracy after officials said they had \"partially recognised\" their involvement in the heist.Investigators believe four men carried out the daylight theft, and one of them is still on the run.Three other people detained earlier this week have been released without charge.Watch: Two people leave Louvre in lift mounted to vehicleOn the day of the heist, the suspects arrived at 09:30 local time (07:30 GMT), just after the museum opened to visitors, Ms Beccuau told reporters last week.The suspects arrived with a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine. The men used a disc cutter to crack open display cases housing the jewellery.Prosecutors said the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38, before switching to cars.One of the stolen items - a crown - was dropped during the escape. The other seven jewels have not been found.The fear is that they have already been spirited abroad, though the prosecutor in charge of the case has said she is still hopeful they can be retrieved intact.Since the incident, security measures have been tightened around France's cultural institutions.The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following the heist.",

    "body": "I'm the luckiest man alive, but also suffering, says Air India crash sole survivor1 hour agoNavtej Johal,BBC News Midlands correspondent, Katie Thompson and Sophie WoodcockViswashkumar Ramesh breaks down in tears as he talks about the loss of his brother in the crashThe sole survivor of the Air India plane crash, which killed 241 people on board, has said he feels like the \"luckiest man\" alive, but is also suffering physically and mentally.Viswashkumar Ramesh walked away from the wreckage of the London-bound flight in Ahmedabad in extraordinary scenes that amazed the world.He said it was a \"miracle\" he escaped but told how he has lost everything, as his younger brother Ajay was a few seats away on the flight and died in the crash in June.Since returning to his home in Leicester, Mr Ramesh has struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), his advisers said, and has been unable to speak to his wife and four-year-old son.Flames engulfed the Boeing 787 flight when it went down shortly after take-off in western India.Shocking video shared at the time showed Mr Ramesh walking away from the aftermath with seemingly superficial injuries, as smoke billowed in the background. Speaking to BBC News, an emotional Mr Ramesh, whose first language is Gujarati, said: \"I'm only one survivor. Still, I'm not believing. It's a miracle.\"I lost my brother as well. My brother is my backbone. Last few years, he was always supporting me.\"He described the devastating impact the ordeal has had on his family life.\"Now I'm alone. I just sit in my room alone, not talking with my wife, my son. I just like to be alone in my house,\" Mr Ramesh said.Watch: The moment Viswashkumar Ramesh walked away from the crashHe spoke from his hospital bed in India at the time, describing how he had managed to unbuckle himself and crawl out of the wreckage, and met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi while receiving treatment for his injuries.Of the passengers and crew killed, 169 were Indian nationals and 52 were Britons, while 19 others were killed on the ground.A preliminary report into the crash, published by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau in July, said fuel supply to the engines was cut off just seconds after take-off. Meanwhile, an investigation is ongoing and the airline said care for Mr Ramesh, and all families affected by the tragedy, \"remains our absolute priority\".This is the first time the 39-year-old has spoken to the media since he has been back in the UK. A documentary crew were also filming in the room.The BBC had detailed discussions with his advisers around his duty of care before the interview.When asked about his memories of the day of the crash, he said: \"I can't say anything about that now.\"'I'm suffering'Flanked by local community leader Sanjiv Patel and spokesman Radd Seiger, Mr Ramesh said it was too painful to recall the events of the disaster, and broke down during parts of an interview at the home of Mr Patel in Leicester.Mr Ramesh described the anguish he and his family are now living through.\"For me, after this accident... very difficult.\"Physically, mentally, also my family as well, mentally... my mum last four months, she is sitting every day outside the door, not talking, nothing.\"I'm not talking to anyone else. I do not like to talk with anyone else.\"I can't talk about much. I'm thinking all night, I'm suffering mentally.\"Every day is painful for the whole family.\"Mr Ramesh also spoke about the physical injuries he suffered in the crash, which saw him escape his seat - 11A - through an opening in the fuselage.He says he suffers pain in his leg, shoulder, knee and back, and has not been able to work or drive since the tragedy.\"When I walk, not walk properly, slowly, slowly, my wife help,\" he added.Sanjiv Patel said he was supporting, advising and protecting the familyMr Ramesh was diagnosed with PTSD while he was being treated in hospital in India but has not received any medical treatment since being back home, his advisers said.They described him as being lost and broken, with a long journey of recovery ahead, and are demanding a meeting with Air India's executives, claiming he has been treated poorly by the airline since the crash.\"They're in crisis, mentally, physically, financially,\" Mr Patel said.\"It's devastated his family.\"Whoever's responsible at the highest level should be on the ground meeting the victims of this tragic event, and understanding their needs and to be heard.\"'Put things right'Air India has offered an interim compensation payment to Mr Ramesh of £21,500, which has been accepted, but his advisers say this is not enough to meet his immediate needs.The family fishing business in Diu in India, which Mr Ramesh ran with his brother before the crash, has since collasped, his advisers said.Spokesman for the family Mr Seiger said they had invited Air India for a meeting on three occasions, and all three were either \"ignored or turned down\". The media interviews were the team's way of reissuing that appeal for the fourth time, he said.Mr Seiger added: \"It's appalling that we are having to sit here today and putting him [Viswashkumar] through this.\"The people who should be sitting here today are the executives of Air India, the people responsible for trying to put things right.\"Please come and sit down with us so that we can work through this together to try and alleviate some of this suffering.\"In a statement, the airline, which is owned by Tata Group, said senior leaders from the parent company continue to visit families to express their deepest condolences.\"An offer has been made to Mr Ramesh's representatives to arrange such a meeting, we will continue to reach out and we very much hope to receive a positive response,\" it said.The airline told the BBC that this offer was made before the media interviews with Mr Ramesh.More on this story",

    "body": "16 hours agoBrandon Drenonin Westmoreland, JamaicaWatch: Hurricane Melissa - aerial view of 'ground zero' destructionFive days after Hurricane Melissa pummelled into western Jamaica with record force, residents in devastated communities along the coast are still desperately waiting for help.Many of the roads are blocked by debris and people are isolated with little food, no power or running water, and no idea of when normalcy will return.The government said on Saturday that at least 28 people in Jamaica have died since the hurricane hit as a monster category five storm with 185 mph (297km/h) sustained winds.That is a near 50% jump in the death toll overnight, and the number could rise as officials clear their way into new parts of the island in the coming days.Local official Dr Dayton Campbell told the BBC 10 of those deaths were in Westmoreland.Westmoreland parish is believed to have the second highest number of unconfirmed deaths, after St Elizabeth to the south east. The eye of the storm hit somewhere between the two neighbouring parishes. At St Elizabeth an estimated 90% of homes have been destroyed.Hurricane death toll rises as Jamaica aid effort strugglesBrandon Drenon / BBC NewsA town just outside of Whitehouse in Westmoreland Parish sits in ruinsA long stretch of road headed west into Westmoreland Parish winds through a graveyard of trees – stacks of branches and limbs, cracked and twisted, blanketing the landscape for miles. It is grim evidence of Hurricane Melissa's ferocity - it was the strongest storm to strike the Caribbean island in modern history.Piles of debris are heaped on the parish's roadsides, next to battered buildings, shipping crates turned on their side and crowds of people wading through the destruction.On Saturday morning, men with machetes hacked through branches as thick as their arms, clearing patches of the road where traffic jams were at a standstill.A policeman with an automatic weapon strapped to his chest, part of a convoy accompanying an aid truck on its way to Westmoreland, hopped out of his vehicle to help direct traffic.\"We don't know what lies ahead,\" the officer told the BBC, describing what he has seen as \"total devastation\".Brandon Drenon / BBCBrandon Drenon / BBCRoy Perry says he has lost everything in the wake of the strongest hurricane in Jamaican historyBrandon Drenon / BBCAnthony Burnett (left) and Gary Williams (right)Those living in Whitehouse, a coastal town and commercial hub on the edge of Westmoreland Parish, say the wait for assistance is becoming frustrating.Gary Williams said he has heard promises of incoming aid delivery, but \"they no turn up\".He sat in the shade on a makeshift stool in front of a building barely standing – its entire roof gone – unsure of what to do next.Williams said he lost his house in the storm and has \"nowhere to live\", suggesting he might sleep right where he is, outside on the front porch.Another woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said: \"Words can't explain the situation that we're in. It's horrible. I don't even know what to say. So many hopeless, helpless and lifeless people here right now.\"About 400,000 people in Jamaica were without power as of Friday, and an untold number more have no access to cell phone service or Wi-Fi, cut off from the outside world.Jamaica's transportation minister Daryl Vaz announced on Saturday that more than 200 StarLink devices have been deployed across the island to help people access the internet.He addressed criticism the government has received for its response, saying there were \"several factors\" contributing to delays.\"Refuelling, Areas for Landing, Accessibility and Timing/Visibility,\" Vaz said on X.Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged that the \"immediate focus is on clearing debris, restoring essential services\", as well as providing food and medical supplies.But that would only solve part of the problem.Brandon Drenon / BBCResidents of Whitehouse in Westmoreland Parish try to piece their lives back togetherIn a tiny community just outside of Whitehouse, Robert Morris rested against a slab of broken concrete. Behind him, the fishing village he has called home his entire life has been destroyed, along with his livelihood.\"We all devastated here, man,\" he said. He said the boat house was destroyed and is now \"flat\".\"Melissa take everything down,\" he said, including his fishing boat, which he describes as \"mashed up\".Morris also told of \"no help, no food, no water\".\"We just have to try and see what we can do,\" he said, adding that his plan was to find someone whose boat was still intact so that he could join and fish.Even then, he is not sure where he would sell his catch.The people in these areas are filled with pride and resilience, words that are often repeated on local radio stations and visible through their optimism in the most difficult circumstances.Seated under the facade of a badly damaged building, Roy Perry said he has lost everything, but \"we have to just keep the faith and the hope is up still\".Brandon Drenon / BBCRobert Morris fishing village in view over his right shoulder has been entirely destroyedBrandon Drenon / BBCOreth Jones, a local farmer, said his farm was \"all wrecked\" \"Can't give up. Not gonna give up,\" he said.It is the same tone struck by Oreth Jones, a farmer sitting in the bed of his truck selling pears, pumpkins, and sweet potatoes – the last of his produce that was spared from the storm.Of his farm, he said: \"It's all wrecked. They all destroyed.\" But he quickly followed up with: \"We have to give God thanks we're alive.\"Jones survived the strongest hurricane in Jamaican history while he was injured, wearing a homemade splint on his right leg from a fracture he suffered during a biking accident before Melissa hit.When asked about how the community will move forward, he said: \"Pray. Nothing else we can do. Nothing else.\"Meanwhile, foreign aid has now started entering into Jamaica. The US State Department announced on Friday that its Disaster Assistance Response Team had arrived. And countries including the UK have also pledged millions in aid relief funds and emergency supplies.",

    "body": "Young Russians are being seduced by a cheap, dangerous weight-loss pill called Molecule1 day agoSofya VolyanovaBBC News Russian Maria22-year-old Maria suffered serious side effects after trying the unlicensed weight loss drug promoted on TikTokMolecule, a pill promising rapid weight loss, went viral on Russian TikTok earlier this year.Young people's feeds started filling up with captions like \"Take Molecule and forget food exists\", and \"Do you want to sit in the back of the class in oversized clothes?\"Clips showed fridges lined with blue boxes featuring holograms and \"Molecule Plus\" labels.The orders began piling in, as teenagers shared their \"weight-loss journeys\" on social media.But there was a catch.Maria, 22, had purchased the pill from a popular online retailer. She took two pills per day and, after two weeks, says her mouth dried up and she completely lost her appetite.\"I had absolutely no desire to eat, let alone drink. I was nervous. I was constantly biting my lips and chewing my cheeks.\"Maria developed severe anxiety and began having negative thoughts. \"These pills were having a profound effect on my psyche,\" she says.Maria, who lives in St Petersburg, says she wasn't prepared for such severe side effects.Other TikTok users mentioned dilated pupils, tremors and insomnia. And at least three schoolchildren are reported to have ended up in hospital.TikTokClips shared on TikTok show fridges lined with soft drinks and blue boxes of MoleculeIn April, a schoolgirl in Chita, Siberia, needed hospital care after overdosing on Molecule. According to local reports, she was trying to lose weight quickly, in time for the summer.The mother of another schoolgirl told local media her daughter was admitted to intensive care after taking several pills at once.And in May, a 13-year-old boy from St Petersburg needed hospital care after experiencing hallucinations and panic attacks. He had reportedly asked a friend to buy him the pill because he was being teased at school about his weight.Substance banned in UK, EU and USThe packaging for Molecule pills often lists \"natural ingredients\" such as dandelion root and fennel seed extract.But earlier this year, journalists at the Russian newspaper Izvestiya submitted pills they had purchased online for testing and found they contained a substance called sibutramine.TikTokThe pills contain a substance called sibutramine, which is banned in many countriesFirst used as an antidepressant in the 1980s and later as an appetite suppressant, studies later found sibutramine increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes - while only slightly promoting weight loss.It was banned in the US in 2010, and is also illegal in the UK, EU, China and other countries.In Russia, it is still used to treat obesity, but available only to adults and by prescription. Purchasing and selling sibutramine without a prescription is a criminal offence. But that hasn't stopped individuals and small businesses from selling it online - often in higher doses than legal medication - and without requiring prescriptions.The unlicensed pills cost about £6-7 ($8-9) for a 20-day supply - much cheaper than recognised weight-loss injections like Ozempic, which on the Russian market sell for £40-160 ($50-210) per monthly pen.\"Self-administration of this drug is very unsafe,\" says endocrinologist Ksenia Solovieva from St Petersburg, warning of potential overdose risks, \"because we do not know how much of the active ingredient such 'dietary supplements' may contain\".TikTokTeenagers and young people order unlicensed weight loss pills sold as dietary supplements from popular marketplacesRussians regularly receive prison sentences for purchasing and reselling Molecule pills. But it's proving difficult for authorities to get a grip on the drug being sold illegally.In April, the government-backed Safe Internet League reported the growing trend involving young people to the authorities - prompting several major online marketplaces to remove Molecule from sale. But it soon began appearing online under a new name, Atom, in near-identical packaging.A law was recently passed allowing authorities to block websites selling \"unregistered dietary supplements\" without a court order - but sellers have been getting around this by categorising them as \"sports nutrition\" instead.On TikTok, you can find retailers selling Molecule under listings that look like they are for muesli, biscuits and even lightbulbs. And some retailers aren't even trying to hide it any more.A few weeks ago, the BBC found Molecule listings on a popular Russian online marketplace. When approached for comment, the site said it had promptly removed any products containing sibutramine. But it admitted it was difficult to find and remove listings that didn't explicitly mention sibutramine.If you do manage to get your hands on Molecule, it's hard to know exactly what you're getting - and it's unclear where the pills are being manufactured.The BBC found some sellers with production certificates from factories in Guangzhou and Henan, in China. Others claim to be sourcing the pills from Germany.Some packets state they were produced in Remagen in Germany - but the BBC has discovered there is no such company listed at the address given.Certain Kazakh vendors selling Molecule to Russians told the BBC they bought stock from friends or warehouses in the capital Astana but couldn't name the original supplier.Details of support with eating disorders in the UK are available at BBC Action Line Meanwhile, online eating-disorder communities have become spaces where Molecule is promoted, with users relying on hashtags and coded terms to slip past moderation.Ms Solovieva says Molecule is particularly harmful when taken by young people who already have eating disorders. For those in or near relapse, an easily available appetite suppressant can be seriously dangerous, she says.Anna Enina, a Russian influencer with millions of followers who herself has admitted using unlicensed weight-loss pills in the past, publicly warned her subscribers: \"As someone who has struggled with an eating disorder... the consequences will be dire. You'll regret it tenfold.\"Maria from St Petersburg now discourages others from trying MoleculeTwenty-two-year old Maria suffered bad side effects, and is one of those who regrets it. After taking too many Molecule pills, she was sent to hospital.Now she discourages other young women and girls from taking the pills in weight-loss forums. She even reached out to one teenage user's parents to alert them.But Molecule remains popular online.And every video that appears on Maria's TikTok feed is a reminder of the pills that made her sick.More weekend picks",

    "body": "An avalanche in Italy's Dolomite mountains has killed five German climbers, including a 17-year-old girl and her father, according to rescuers. The mountaineers, travelling in separate groups, were scaling Cima Vertana in the Ortler Alps at around 16:00 local time on Saturday when the fast-moving snow hit.  A group of three people \"was fully swept away by the avalanche\" and all died, said Italy's Alpine rescue service, Soccorso Alpino e Speleologico.Separately, the father and daughter were carried away by the avalanche and their bodies were recovered on Sunday. Two other climbers in a third party survived.The alarm was raised by the survivors, triggering the rescue operation.Olaf Reinstadler, a spokesperson for the Sulden Mountain Rescue Service, told German media that the avalanche on the 3,545-metre (11,630ft) mountain, also called Vertainspitze, could have been caused by recent snow drifts which had not bonded to the ice below.He said climbing tours were popular and the weather conditions were good, but wondered why the mountaineers were climbing late in the afternoon, as the descent would have then taken until nightfall.The bodies of the three people climbing together were recovered on Saturday before rescue efforts were suspended due to fading light and safety conditions. The Alpine rescue service said that due to fog and low visibility, helicopters could not take off at first light on Sunday.However, once conditions improved, rescuers and avalanche dog units were airlifted to 2,600 metres before setting out on foot.By late morning, the bodies of the two missing mountaineers - the father and daughter - were found.",

    "body": "The Netherlands has said it will return a stolen 3,500-year-old sculpture to Egypt.It is \"highly likely\" the stone head, dating from the time of the pharaohs, was plundered during the Arab Spring in either 2011 or 2012, according to the Dutch  Information & Heritage Inspectorate.A decade later, it turned up at an arts and antiques fair in Maastricht and, following an anonymous tip-off, Dutch authorities determined it had been stolen and exported illegally. Dutch outgoing prime minister Dick Schoof made the pledge to hand it back as he attended the opening of the archaeological Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza this weekend.The Dutch government said the sculpture of a high-ranking official from the dynasty of Pharaoh Thutmose III is \"deeply meaningful to Egypt's identity\".The statue had been offered up for sale at The European Fine Art Foundation fair in 2022. The dealer voluntarily relinquished the sculpture after authorities had been tipped off about its illegal origin. The government said it expected to hand the stone head over to the Egyptian ambassador to the Netherlands at the end of this year.\"The Netherlands is committed both nationally and internationally to ensuring the return of heritage to its original owners,\" it said.The news comes as Egypt celebrated the opening of the enormous Grand Egyptian Museum showcasing its archaeological heritage this weekend.First proposed in 1992, the construction of the museum itself was interrupted by the Arab Spring.Costing around $1.2bn (£910m), the facility contains 100,000 artefacts, including the entire contents of the intact tomb of the boy king Tutankhamun and his famous gold mask.Prominent Egyptologists are hoping the museum will strengthen demands for key antiquities held in other countries to be returned.These include the Rosetta Stone, the key to deciphering hieroglyphics, which is on display at the British Museum in London.",

    "body": "Trump tells military to prepare for 'action' against Islamist militants in Nigeria15 hours agoJoseph WinterGetty ImagesDonald Trump says he would also cut all aid to NigeriaUS President Donald Trump has ordered the military to prepare for action in Nigeria to tackle Islamist militant groups, accusing the government of failing to protect Christians.Trump did not say which killings he was referring to, but claims of a genocide against Nigeria's Christians have been circulating in recent weeks and months in some right-wing US circles.Groups monitoring violence say there is no evidence to suggest that Christians are being killed more than Muslims in Nigeria, which is roughly evenly divided between followers of the two religions.An advisor to Nigeria's president told the BBC that any military action against the jihadist groups should be carried out together.Daniel Bwala said Nigeria would welcome US help in tackling the Islamist insurgents but noted that it was a \"sovereign\" country.He also said the jihadists were not targeting members of a particular religion and that they had killed people from all faiths, or none. Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu has insisted there is religious tolerance in the country and said the security challenges were affecting people \"across faiths and regions\".Trump wrote in a social media post on Saturday that he had instructed the US Department of War to prepare for \"possible action\".He warned that he might send the military into Nigeria \"guns-a-blazing\" unless the Nigerian government intervened, and said that all aid to what he called \"the now disgraced country\" would be cut.Trump added: \"If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!\"US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth replied to the post by writing: \"Yes sir.\"The Department of War is preparing for action. Either the Nigerian Government protects Christians, or we will kill the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.\"Trump's threat has triggered alarm across Nigeria. Many on social media are urging the government to step up its fight against Islamist groups to avert a situation where foreign troops are sent into the country.But Mr Bwala, who said he was a Christian pastor, told the BBC's Newshour programme that Trump had a \"unique way of communicating\" and that Nigeria was not taking his words literally.\"We know the heart and intent of Trump is to help us fight insecurity,\" he said, adding that he hoped Trump would meet Tinubu in the coming days to discuss the issue.Trump earlier announced that he had declared Nigeria a \"Country of Particular Concern\" because of the \"existential threat\" posed to its Christian population. He said \"thousands\" had been killed, without providing any evidence.This is a designation used by the US State Department that provides for sanctions against countries \"engaged in severe violations of religious freedom\".Following this announcement, Tinubu said his government was committed to working with the US and the international community to protect communities of all faiths.\"The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality,\" the Nigerian leader said in a statement.Jihadist groups such as Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province have wrought havoc in north-eastern Nigeria for more than a decade, killing thousands of people - however most of these have been Muslims, according to Acled, a group which analyses political violence around the world.In central Nigeria, there are also frequent clashes between mostly Muslim herders and farming groups, who are often Christian, over access to water and pasture. Deadly cycles of tit-for-tat attacks have also seen thousands killed, but atrocities have been committed on both sides and human rights group say there is no evidence that Christians have been disproportionately targeted.Trump has frequently expressed satisfaction over not having embroiled the US in a war during his tenure, and has cast himself as a peace-making president.But the Republican leader is facing a growing number of voices domestically, particularly from the political right, who have drawn attention to the situation in Nigeria.Additional reporting by Chris Ewokor in AbujaMore about Nigeria from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "3 hours agoDamian GrammaticasPolitical correspondentLaura MurphyProfessor Laura Murphy says her academic freedom was traded for access to the Chinese student marketChina waged a campaign of harassment and intimidation directed at a UK university to get it to shut down sensitive research into alleged human rights abuses, documents seen by the BBC show.Sheffield Hallam University staff in China were threatened by individuals described by them as being from China's National Security Service who demanded the research being  done in Sheffield be halted.And access to the university's websites from China was blocked, impeding its ability to recruit Chinese students, in a campaign of threats and intimidation lasting more than two years.In an internal email from July 2024, university officials said \"attempting to retain the business in China and publication of the research are now untenable bedfellows\".When the UK government learned of the case, the then Foreign Secretary David Lammy issued a warning to his Chinese counterpart that it would not tolerate attempts to suppress academic freedoms at UK universities, the BBC understands.The issue was also raised with China's most senior education minister.China was seeking to halt research by Laura Murphy, professor of human rights and contemporary slavery at Sheffield Hallam, into allegations Uyghur Muslims in the north-western region of Xinjiang were subject to forced labour.China has faced accusations – always firmly denied – that it has committed crimes against humanity and possibly genocide against the Uyghur population.In late 2024, following pressure from the Chinese state and a separate defamation law suit against the university, Sheffield Hallam decided not to publish a final piece of research by Prof Murphy and her team into forced labour.And in early 2025, university administrators told her that she could \"not continue with her research into supply chains and forced labour in China\".She initiated legal action against the university for failing in its duty to protect her academic freedom and she submitted a \"subject access request\" demanding Sheffield Hallam hand over any relevant internal documents.The documents she obtained showed the university \"had negotiated directly with a foreign intelligence service to trade my academic freedom for access to the Chinese student market,\" she told the BBC.She added: \"I'd never seen anything quite so patently explicit about the extent to which a university would go to ensure that they have Chinese student income.\"Getty ImagesThe Uyghurs are the largest minority ethnic group in China's north-western province of XinjiangSheffield Hallam has now apologised to Prof Murphy and said she can resume her work.A spokesperson said \"the university's decision to not continue with Professor Laura Murphy's research was taken based on our understanding of a complex set of circumstances at the time, including being unable to secure the necessary professional indemnity insurance\".They said the university wished to \"make clear our commitment to supporting her research and to securing and promoting freedom of speech and academic freedom within the law\".But the general secretary of the University and College Union, Jo Grady, said \"it is incredibly worrying that Sheffield Hallam appears to have attempted to silence its own professor on behalf of a foreign government\".She added: \"Given the censorship Hallam has seemingly engaged in, it now needs to set out how it will ensure its academics will be supported to research freely and protected from overreach by foreign powers.\"A government spokesperson told the BBC \"any attempt by a foreign state to intimidate, harass or harm individuals in the UK will not be tolerated, and the government has made this clear to Beijing after learning of this case\". Internal documents shared with the BBC show Sheffield Hallam under pressureIt all began so differently.When, in 2021, Prof Murphy published a major report into Uhygur forced labour in the solar panel industry, the director of the Helena Kennedy Centre (HKC), the department in which her unit was based, wrote to congratulate her.\"This is an exceptional moment in the history of the HKC... we are all exceptionally proud of this body of work which rightly shines light on the blatant abuse of Uyghur tights (sic) in China.. Well done Laura!\"Over the following months her unit published four reports, including into car parts and cotton for clothing, trying to trace supply chains and highlight where goods reaching western consumers may have been produced with inputs made with forced labour in Xinjiang.China denies such practices occur.The Chinese Embassy in London told the BBC \"the Helena Kennedy Centre at the Sheffield Hallam University has released multiple fake reports on Xinjiang that are seriously flawed\".\"It has been revealed that some authors of these reports received funding from certain US agencies,\" the Embassy added.Prof Murphy told the BBC she has received funding over the course of her career from the US National Endowment for Humanities for work on slave narratives, the US Department of Justice for work on human trafficking in New Orleans, and more recently from USAID, the US State Department and the UK Foreign Office for her work on China.The Chinese Embassy said the allegations of \"forced labor\" in her reports \"cannot withstand basic fact-check\".\"While presenting itself as an academic body, the Centre has in practice acted as a vehicle for politicised and disinformation-driven narratives deployed by anti-China forces,\" the embassy added.The university realised it was coming in for criticism from China as far back as 2022.An internal university email from August of that year, seen by the BBC, said China's foreign ministry had issued a statement \"denouncing us as being in the 'disreputable vanguard of anti-China rhetoric'\".The email said the university had admitted 500 Chinese students in 2018, but numbers had collapsed in the pandemic and had not bounced back like it had in other markets. It expressed concern that the Chinese government's criticisms could result in a \"boycott\" by prospective students and recruitment agents. In total, the documents show Sheffield had earned £3.8m in 2021/22 from China and Hong Kong.Later in August 2022 the university's English language testing website used by Chinese students to take tests before coming to Sheffield had been \"shut down in China temporarily\".Over the next two years the pressure escalated dramatically leading university officials to write in an email in May 2024 that \"the continuation of the university's scholarly activity with and in China and Hong Kong has been placed at risk because of the research activities, led by Professor Laura Murphy, in relation to alleged persecution of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang Province, China\".An internal \"risk summary,\" dated 9 December 2024, detailed what had happened.In August 2022, China had blocked access to the university's websites. All email communication from and to the university was disabled.It meant students in China due to study at Sheffield Hallam were unable to access the enrolment website, arrange their welcome or airport pick up in the UK, or course information.The university said this had \"undoubtedly had a negative impact on recruitment\" in 23/24, with \"anticipated further decline in 24/25\".And, in 2024, the intimidation began.UK ParliamentBaroness Kennedy says UK universities are vulnerable to pressure from China\"Things in Beijing have kicked off,\" an internal email from 18 April 2024 said.The risk summary detailed that \"three officers of the National Security Service\" visited Sheffield Hallam's office in China.A local staff member was \"questioned for two hours regarding the HKC research and future publications. \"The tone was threatening and message to cease the research activity was made clear.\"At another visit, security officers said the internet issues were because the Uyghur research was available on the university website.Finally, in September 2024, the document states \"a decision by the university not to publish a final phase of the research on forced labour in China was communicated to the National Security Service .. immediately relations improved and the threat to staff wellbeing appears to be removed\".Sheffield Hallam says these internal communications need to be seen in context and do not represent university policy.Complicating things for Sheffield Hallam had been a report by its Forced Labour Lab published December 2023 into clothing supply chains connected to Xinjiang.Smart Shirts Ltd, a Hong Kong supplier of garments with customers in the UK, brought a claim for libel, alleging it had been defamed as its name was included.A preliminary ruling at the High Court in London in December 2024 found that report had been \"defamatory\".A full trial in that case is yet to take place at which Sheffield Hallam will be able to put forward its defence to the company's claim, but the university was told by its insurers that \"any defamation, libel or slander\" claims linked to its entire Social and Economic Research Institute were no longer covered.Professor Murphy had, meanwhile, built an international profile.Her work had been cited in the UK parliament, in Canada and in Australia. She had taken a career break in late 2023 to work for the US Department of Homeland Security, helping it with the implementation of their Uyghur Forced Labour Prevention Act.In her absence, and amid the pressure from China and the lawsuit, Sheffield Hallam decided her unit would close in early 2025.\"Despite significant offers of continued funding we have decided it is in our best interests to terminate the research,\" an email of August 2024 said.It added that by not publishing the final report under the university's auspices it hoped \"we can minimise the possibility of any further scrutiny of our operations .. thereby attending to related duty of care issues\".But failing to publish the report was a breach of the terms agreed with the external groups who had agreed to fund the research.So the university decided to close the unit and not use any outstanding funds.Sheffield Hallam said it was normal practice for research groups to stand down at the end of an external contract.Sheffield Hallam says China is no longer a significant student market for the universityWhen Prof Murphy returned from her career break in early 2025, the university told her of its \"decision not to continue with her research into supply chains and forced labour in China due to .. the corporate insurance position .. and our duty of care to colleagues working in both China and the UK\".Any other work or public engagements outside the university would also have to be checked for \"conflict of interest\".Seeking to continue her work, Prof Murphy began her legal action and made a subject access request to the university requiring it to turn over relevant internal documents.\"What about the duty of care to me and the duty of care to the rest of my research team?,\" Prof Murphy told the BBC.\"They laid off my entire research team. Sent them away. They sent back all of our research funding, and they shuttered the entire programme without regard for the people who worked with us on that project, so many of them Uyghur folks.\"She added: \"As long as the university system in the UK is so wildly underfunded as it is now, universities will be vulnerable to attacks like this.\"After receiving her apology from the university and a pledge to protect her academic freedom, she is not currently pursuing her legal action.  Her case had been built on the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act 2023, which places on universities a duty to promote freedom of speech and academic freedom for their staff.Her solicitors, Leigh Day, had argued that a lack of insurance  and \"unspecified\" concerns about staff safety do not provide universities carte blanche to restrict freedoms.The law firm believes refusing to authorise any research on a particular country would be unlawful.Sheffield Hallam's spokesperson said: \"For the avoidance of doubt, the decision was not based on commercial interests in China.\"Regardless, China is not a significant international student market for the university.\"The university only enrolled 73 students from China in 2024/25.The Chinese Embassy said \"there are over 200,000 Chinese students in the UK, making China the largest source of international students in the UK,\"  adding \"educational cooperation has become a driving force in bilateral ties\".Baroness Helena Kennedy KC, patron of the centre that bears her name, said UK universities were \"vulnerable\" to pressure from China because \"bringing in Chinese students is one of the ways of dealing with the financial crises that universities are facing\".\"If we see limitations being made on the kind of research that goes on in these universities, I think we should be alarmed,\" added the Labour peer, who has herself been sanctioned by China for speaking out about issues related to Xinjiang.",

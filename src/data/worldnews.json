    "body": "7 hours agoJeremy BowenInternational Editor, KyivBBCOn a dark and cold night in Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, the netting protecting the road from attacks by explosive drones shimmered and rippled in the headlights of our armoured Toyota Land Cruiser, as we drove down strange and surreal tunnels to get in and out of the most intensive area of fighting in eastern Ukraine. The nets go on for miles, suspended from wooden poles around 20ft high along the sides and over the top of the road. Dystopian military vehicles straight out of Mad Max rumble past, encased in their own cages of steel and netting.Nets snag the propellers of attacking drones, making them a cheap and surprisingly effective physical barrier. Even if their Russian controllers detonate the charge they carry, there is a chance that the explosion will not be close enough to kill people using the road in civilian buses and cars as well as military vehicles.Much of the netting has been donated by European fishermen. Only this week the Scottish government announced it was sending over another 280 tonnes of salmon nets that were about to be recycled. Before any of it gets used, the Ukrainian military crashes drones into it to test its strength.In Ukraine, anti-drone nets go on for miles, suspended from wooden poles The three most feared letters on the battlefield are FPV, standing for \"first-person view.\" FPV drones are major killers, used by both Ukraine and Russia. They have cameras that feed information back to their controllers in a command centre that might be 30 or 40km away. We visited a few of them, hidden away in basements of wrecked buildings or nondescript village houses.Inside there are banks of screens, relaying video and data from drones that is analysed by the Ukrainian military's leading-edge software. The cameras zoom in on small figures of soldiers moving around the ruins, with the controllers directing the men on the ground through walkie-talkies, callsigns and headsets. We could see the men entering buildings where the drones had seen Russians hiding, and emerging after they had killed them. Early versions of the drones were controlled by radio signals, but both sides are experts at electronic warfare and quickly found ways to jam them. Now they are mostly controlled by fibre optic cables, so thin that a spool 25km long (that carries data and video) fits into a container built into the drone that is the size of a large bottle of bleach.The nets snag the propellers of attacking dronesEastern Ukraine used to feel like a throwback to the Western Front in World War One, with trenches and dugouts reinforced against artillery and snipers. After the full-scale invasion four years ago it still, for a while, felt like a 20th Century battlefield. But now drones have transformed the way the war is fought, and armies across the world are watching closely, being forced to change their ideas of how to fight.The narrow confrontation line that used to exist between the two sides is now extended across a broad swathe of land that both sides call the kill zone, stretching perhaps 20km either side of the forward positions of the two armies. Rear positions for logistics and dealing with casualties that used to be relatively safe are now as lethal as the old front line. The skies above get saturated with surveillance drones, making movement extremely dangerous. Social media feeds are full of terrifying videos filmed from FPV drones as they swoop into their targets, sometimes chasing down individuals in the open, or even entering buildings, threading their way through rooms and doorways until they find their quarry. The last shot is often of a horrified man about to die.Artillery and tanks are still formidable weapons. But a drone that costs around a thousand dollars can, in the hands of a skilled pilot, destroy a tank that costs $30m (£22m). The Wall St Journal recently reported that a small group of Ukrainian drone pilots created havoc when they were invited to oppose Nato forces in an exercise in Estonia last year. Nato has a lot of catching up to do. One major consequence of the last four years of war is that Ukraine and Russia are now the most experienced and proficient practitioners of drone warfare in the world.Both countries are constantly innovating to get ahead in the drone war. Both have been using Starlink system owned by the world's richest man, Elon Musk for battlefield communications and navigation. The Russians had a recent setback when Musk agreed to turn off Russian-registered terminals active inside Ukraine. That seems to be a major reason why Ukraine, with an active Starlink system funded by Poland, recently recaptured territory in the south.But all the Ukrainian drone units I visited believed that the Russians would soon find a workaround. They respect the skills of the elite Russian drone units they said were called Rubicon and Day of Judgement. A senior officer told me that western Europeans need to forget the military blunders Russia made after the full-scale invasion four years ago and make a distinction between the thousands of front-line Russian soldiers who are killed every month and the elite drone units that Moscow values as a key part of their war effort. He said they were \"cherished\" by the Russian army.FPV drones have cameras that feed information back to their controllersOn my most recent visit to Ukraine, the threat from drones meant we watched the weather forecast closely before heading into Donetsk, postponing during a day of clear blue skies and waiting for more snow. Drones struggle in bad weather.Feeling a little reassured by the nets and the snow, we headed towards the town of Slovyansk, past the ruined shells of buildings destroyed over the last four years. Slovyansk functions as a town, just about, with some cafes and shops open. But  thousands of residents have moved to safer places, and when the people who have stayed go out, their fear of Russian FPV drones means they hurry down the icy, snow-covered streets to get through their errands to make it home alive. Nets are going up in the town centre.Slovyansk is high on Russian President Vladimir Putin's uncompromising list of terms for a ceasefire. A big part of the price he is demanding is for Ukraine to give up the 20% or so of Donetsk it still controls, along with other land that his army has been unable to capture, in the southern regions of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. According to Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Americans have pushed him to take the deal, to get to a ceasefire by the summer.US President Donald Trump also wants Zelensky to call an election, a demand he has not directed at Putin. The evidence suggests that Trump wants to be able to declare he has ended the war. Even if a ceasefire didn't last, he would treat it as a victory he will take into the US mid-term elections next autumn. He is also eyeing huge business deals with Russia, which cannot happen until sanctions are lifted.The Americans have tried to impose deadlines for a deal. Most recently they told Zelensky he needed to agree to a ceasefire by the summer that Donald Trump could concentrate on the mid-terms. The US inability to bend Ukraine – or Russia – to its will shows that its leverage has limits. Four years after Russia's full scale invasion, there is no discernible evidence that a genuine ceasefire is coming .The dangers in DonetskWhen I saw President Zelensky this weekend in Kyiv, he told me that he could never give up land that Russia has not been able to capture. He would never, he said, abandon the people there, and even if he was tempted to do so it would not work, as within two years by his reckoning, the Russian military would be ready and reequipped and Putin would order them to attack again.The first person we visited in Slovyansk was Oleh Tkachenko, a beefy middle-aged pastor who has built up a remarkable relief operation. He is one of the few people outside the military who travel to the most dangerous areas, delivering bread to outlying villages that he makes in his own bakery, which produces 17,000 loaves per week.After his deliveries he often returns with residents who have had enough of living near the front line. Oleh's bakery is an oasis of order and warmth in the freezing, snow-covered ruins of an industrial area on the edge of Slovyansk.The UN World Food Programme helped him re-establish it when he was forced out of his hometown, which is now occupied. He told me that the dangers in Donetsk have multiplied in the last few months as the drone war has intensified.\"The situation has changed radically. There are only very dangerous places and relatively dangerous places. Nowhere is safe in the Donetsk region anymore.\"I asked him whether Zelensky should give in to Russian and American pressure to sacrifice Donetsk for a ceasefire. It was the same question I put to everyone I met in Slovyansk, and it produced the same kind of answer.\"What more does Putin want? This is my Donetsk region. I was born here. My children were born here. I created my family here. And I should leave all that? What for?\"Putin, he said, should not be allowed to take and keep territory that does not belong to Russia.\"We are destroying the values on which this world is built on one person's whim. Not only will the villain avoid punishment, he [will] also be rewarded? I'm sorry. How many villains like this are there in the world?\"AFP via Getty ImagesZelensky said he could never give up land that Russia has not been able to captureAt a coffee bar I met Oleksii Yukov. He runs an organisation called Advis Platsdarm that collects the bodies of dead soldiers from where they were killed, to honour their memory, and before they get a decent burial, identify them to give their families some certainty about them. Oleksii makes no distinctions between dead Russians and dead Ukrainians, but that does not mean he is also prepared to accept Russian domination in Donetsk. Like Oleh, he does not believe promises made by Putin.\"So if a maniac comes to your home and says, \"Give me your daughter and I won't come back,\" do you really think that a man like this – who rapes and pillages - is simply going to stop?\"\"We all know who the maniacs are, right? It's horrifying. To give away a part of yourself – or your child – to be torn apart… I don't understand why this question is even asked of Ukrainians.\"Oleksii has also recovered the remains of soldiers killed in World War Two in the Donbas, the name used for Donetsk and its neighbouring region, Luhansk, which has fallen to Russia in its entirety. He compares Putin's promises to ones made by Adolf Hitler at the Munich conference in 1938. Hitler claimed that a slice of Czechoslovakia known as the Sudetenland was his last territorial demand in Europe. Britain and France accepted his word as the price of avoiding the World War that started the following year. Like many people in this part of Europe, Oleksii sees parallels with the past.\"Promises made by Russia are worth nothing – just like Hitler's promises that once he took the Sudetenland nothing else would happen. We all saw what that led to: the Second World War. Now it could lead to a Third World War if we do not stop and tell Putin that people live here – people who want to live in their own country, on their own land. Each of them has that right. No Ukrainian has the right to say we can give anything away.\"Oleksii believes that forcing Ukraine to give up Donetsk without a fight would be as much of a betrayal as Czechoslovakia suffered at Munich.Along with its embattled neighbour Kramatorsk, Slovyansk is designated as a \"fortress city\". Both are protected by miles of deep anti-tank ditches filled with razor wire and concrete anti-tank obstacles known as \"dragon's teeth\". The towns sit on a range of hills that is the last high ground before around 150 miles of flat land, mostly fields, that stretch right up to the next natural obstacle, the mighty Dnieper River that bisects Ukraine from north to south. Ukrainians argue that stopping the Russians if they reached the flatlands would be much harder.The BeginningFour years ago, almost to the day, I was at the main railway station in Kyiv, watching a scene straight out of Europe's dark past play out in a bitter wind off the Ukrainian steppe. Kyiv was in the depths of a frigid winter so monochrome that the scene on the platform could have been an old newsreel, but it was 2022 and happening in a technicolour, digital age. It was the loudest warning yet that the world had changed, that old assumptions about European security and the safety of the future had to be forgotten.Since then, other warnings have sounded, in the Middle East, in Sudan and in Taiwan, while the war in Ukraine has incubated the biggest crisis in the North Atlantic alliance since it was created in 1949. The gap remains wide between Trump's openness to Putin and the much harsher view of Moscow held by most European members of Nato.Getty ImagesZelensky said earlier this month that 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the last four yearsIn that first week of the war, the platforms at Kyiv station were packed, mostly with Ukrainian women and children, desperate to board trains going west to escape the advancing Russian army. Russian artillery and answering salvoes from the Ukrainians echoed around the empty streets of the city centre, making the threat to the city frighteningly real. Trains pulled in every 15 or 20 minutes, as many as the endlessly enterprising operators of Ukraine's railway network could find in the sidings and marshalling yards. Frightened people jostled their way on, leaving tearful goodbyes on the platform with those staying to fight. At the height of the evacuation 50,000 people a day were passing through the station.In the station concourse a young soldier with a Kalashnikov slung across his back was hugging his girlfriend before she left to go west and he went back to his unit. They could have been a Norman Rockwell cover for the Saturday Evening Post, the magazine that cheered on Americans after they entered World War Two.Zelensky showed immediately that he was an instinctive war leader, a born communicator who was able to rally his people. On the first dark night of the war, dismissing rumours that he had fled, he appeared in olive green military attire, recording a video selfie in front of the presidency building in Kyiv, with his closest advisors behind him.\"We are all here, our soldiers are here, the citizens of the country are here. We are all here protecting our independence, our country and we are going to continue to do so.\"Getty ImagesUkraine and Russia have been fighting since 2014 when President Putin ordered the occupation and annexation of Crimea on the Black SeaThe first months of Russia's full-scale invasion went by for Ukrainians in waves of fear, determination, grief, and patriotic fervour. Some of the Russian soldiers in towns they had occupied around Kyiv carried out massacres – leaving the bodies sprawled where they had been killed on the highway, on the streets of Bucha and in shallow graves. We saw the bodies after Ukraine forced the Russians to retreat from the capital, a victory that confounded the prediction of their western allies that they would be beaten in a few weeks.Ukraine's unexpected strength persuaded the then US President Joe Biden and other European leaders to send more powerful weapons to Kyiv, though never as many or as fast as the Ukrainians wanted. Ukrainians who stayed were volunteering to fight. Those who couldn't set up workshops that churned out Molotov cocktails and camouflage netting.Four years on that energy has dissipated. That should not be surprising. War is all-consuming, and exhausting.It has been replaced by a grim determination to carry on, especially among front line soldiers and their families. Zelensky said earlier this month that 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the last four years, accepting that many more were classified as missing. The real figure is likely to be much higher than 55,000. The chances are that their remains are somewhere along the 800-mile front line.Recruiting new soldiers to replace them in the terrible danger of the deadly and expanding kill zone on the front lines is a struggle. In the cities and at checkpoints men of military age face snap inspections of their papers. If they are eligible for conscription, and do not have an exemption from service, they can be driven off to the barracks on the spot.Getting enough soldiers to fight on is one of Ukraine's greatest challenges, yet polls show substantial majorities here believe that Ukraine can fight on, despite Russian advances on the battlefield, and has no choice as they believe Russia wants to destroy them as a nation. A majority also do not believe that the US-brokered talks will produce a lasting peace. But even though a majority believe Ukraine does not have a choice about fighting on, putting on a uniform and heading for the front line is not a popular choice.Global Images Ukraine via Getty ImagesIn Kyiv, civilians are being killed in their own homes by Russian drones and ballistic missilesValeriy Puzik, an author and poet, volunteered to fight and has spent months at the front line. I met him in a trendy bar in Kyiv, a world away from the six metre deep dug out he inhabited with his squad at the front line for more than 100 days. I asked him why it was so hard to recruit.\"Because when a person leaves a position, they don't say anything positive. And word of mouth does the worst damage. Because, there is nothing positive there. I wouldn't wish any of my friends to crawl into a burrow and sit there… I was lucky to survive. Usually, people sit in those burrows for 90, 100, 160 days. We were basically supposed to stay there until spring.\"Valeriy survived his latest deployment to the front because he volunteered to evacuate two wounded comrades.Before he could be sent back, his old position was attacked and the men who stayed behind, he says, were killed or are missing. Evacuating the wounded men, he believes, saved his life.\"If it weren't for those injuries, most likely we all would have died there.\"The Long WarUkraine and Russia have been fighting since 2014 when President Putin ordered the occupation and annexation of Crimea on the Black Sea and then seized parts of the Donbas in the east.On this current trip, I have seen no evidence that the war is going to end soon.The full-scale invasion four years ago was Putin's attempt to eliminate the independence of Ukraine once and for all. He has said many times that history shows Ukraine belongs with Russia. A few days before the anniversary of the invasion President Zelensky dismissed that succinctly in a post on X: \"I don't need historical shit to end this war and move to diplomacy. Because it's just a delay tactic. I read no less history books than Putin. And I learned a lot.\"Zelensky has weathered a corruption scandal that forced the resignation last autumn of his chief of staff, Andrii Yermak. He has trenchant critics, and potential rivals, but still has approval ratings of which most western leaders can only dream.Gwara Media/Global Images Ukraine via Getty ImagesThe Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022This week, far to the east of Kyiv, the trains that evacuated hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians in February and March 2022 are still taking people out of harm's way. The Russia military moves at a glacial pace, but in the key battleground of Donetsk in the east it is grinding forward, chewing up lives, the landscape, and whole villages and towns. Ukraine still holds around a fifth of Donetsk oblast, or region. It is the most intensely fought-over part of Ukraine.One after another, a series of battles over four years have turned towns and villages into rubble, from Bakhmut earlier in the war to Pokrovsk now.Every day buses cross the regional border from Donetsk to Lozova in the Kharkiv oblast, carrying civilian evacuees. A school has been turned into a warm and clean relief coordination centre – packed with families surrounded with a few bags of possessions, dogs on leads, cats in baskets and most of all tormented by loss. Serhii and Viktoria had arrived from Druzhkivka, a town that has been sucked into the kill zone. Their teenage daughter Diana sat silently next to them, with her cat Mika on her lap. Like millions of others displaced by war, here and in other turbulent stretches of the world, they were leaving to save themselves, knowing too well that also meant not just losing the remains of their old lives, but also personal independence. Now they had to sit and wait while the paperwork was done and someone else told them what to do. Viktoria explained why they had left their home.\"We are on the brink. We didn't have any gas, water or power. No heating. We were staying there till the very last moment, freezing for three days.\"Back at the end of 2022, their town, Druzhkivka, was seen as a relatively safe haven when we used it as a base to report the Russian attack on Bakhmut. But no one goes there now, Viktoria says. Druzhkivka is too dangerous.\"The drones destroy everything alive – the cars, the people, their homes. I can't tell you without tears.\"Serhii looked prematurely old.\"It is very difficult. We have abandoned everything we worked for our whole lives. Everything we worked for, for our families, all we were building. And we had to abandon all that in one moment…everything… We could only pack some small things. We could not have taken more.\"Standing near them was Tamara, with her nine-year-old twin granddaughters, Mila and Tina.\"The kids. We left because of the kids. We live near the forest… There are lots of tanks… drones are flying everywhere… there is no peace …the children are running to me and crying… it is very loud…. Everything is shaking…\"Lviv in western Ukraine, where families were send to from Lozova Once they were registered, the families with their bags and their pets were bused to Lozova station, to board a long train heading for Lviv in western Ukraine. Lozova used to be a busy junction for trains heading further east. Now it is now the last stop for Ukrainian railways. The lines beyond it are too dangerous.A defiant UkraineThe talks brokered by Trump's envoys, the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner and his friend, the real estate billionaire, Steve Witkoff, continue. They are expected to convene again in Geneva after the anniversary of the invasion. Witkoff made positive noises after the last round but both Russia and Ukraine talked about a difficult atmosphere.It is hard to see any kind of ceasefire emerging unless either Putin or Zelensky change their fundamental positions. Since both sides believe they can fight on to some kind of victory that is not likely to change.The negotiations appear more of an exercise in placating Trump, so that he cannot blame either Moscow or Kyiv for their failure. The US president tends to default back to putting pressure on Ukraine. In the past he has claimed, untruthfully, that Zelensky is a dictator who started the war. Zelensky laughed and said it wasn't true when I asked him about it. On the eve of the last round, just before the anniversary Trump told journalists that \"Ukraine better come to the table, fast\".AFP via Getty ImagesPresident Zelensky said if Ukraine is to fight on, it will need increasing levels of European supportTrump has ended almost all military aid, but Ukraine still depends on intelligence only the US can provide. Europe buys US weapons, especially interceptor missiles from the Americans on behalf of Ukraine.On this trip to Ukraine I have found a country that remains defiant. It does not feel close to defeat.The big cities function well, despite Russia's concerted and effective attacks throughout this bitterly cold winter on its power and heating grid. In Kyiv, there are traffic jams, well-stocked shops, restaurants and cafés. There are also air-raid sirens, often in the small hours of the morning, and terrible stories of civilians being killed in their own homes by Russian drones and ballistic missiles. Ukraine is rebuilding the military-industrial complex that existed here in Soviet times, concentrating on long range strikes on Russia.Russia has made concerted and effective attacks on Ukraine's power and heating gridPresident Zelensky told me they can win the war, and if Ukraine is to fight on, it will need increasing levels of European support.Spring is in sight, but in this part of Europe winter can drag on into April. Russia has put immense pressure on Ukraine throughout the coldest winter in years by targeting power stations and Soviet-era plants that provide districts with hot water and heat.In the ruins of a power station that the Ukrainians allowed us to visit on condition we did not identify it, workers were salvaging steel from the wreckage. The plant had been hammered by Russian missiles and drones. Repairs were out of the question. It needed to be rebuilt. With his breath condensing in clouds in temperatures double figures below zero, a foreman summed the attitude that is common here, when I asked him why Russia was attacking them.\"They want to make us kneel. They want to bring Ukraine to its knees.\"That is a fact, and Ukraine's determination to stop it happening is why this war continues.More from InDepthTop picture credit: Global Images Ukraine via Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "1 hour agoMalu CursinoGetty ImagesCelebrity doctor Peter Attia has stepped down from his role as a CBS News contributor after exchanges with Jeffrey Epstein were among documents published by the US Department of Justice.Attia appears to have exchanged a number of emails with the convicted sex offender, including a crass comment about women's bodies.Attia's spokesman said in a statement his role at CBS News \"was newly established and had not yet meaningfully begun\" and he would be step back to avoid becoming \"a distraction from the important work being done at CBS\".The anti-ageing influencer has repeatedly apologised for the messages but stressed he had no involvement in Epstein's criminality.Appearing in the files does not imply any wrongdoing.Attia was among 19 contributors appointed by new CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss in January, following the network's takeover by Paramount.But Attia's appearance in the Epstein files has been met with anger by some of his fans.The author wrote that he went into Epstein \"withdrawal when I don't see him\" and told the disgraced financier directly in one exchange that he missed him.In one email in 2016, Attia also joked with Epstein about the female anatomy and acts of sex.Epstein was convicted of soliciting a minor in 2008 as part of a plea deal after the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police that he had molested their daughter. He died in custody in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges including sex trafficking.Days after the documents were published, Attia shared a 1,000-word note on social media in which he rejected being \"involved in any criminal activity\" and stressed that he was \"never on his [Epstein's] plane, never on his island, and never present at any sex parties\".\"My interactions with Epstein had nothing to do with his sexual abuse or exploitation of anyone.\"The health influencer said he visited Epstein at the late financier's New York City home on \"seven or eight\" occasions between 2014 and 2019, during which he never witnessed illegal activity or saw Epstein accompanied by anyone who appeared to be underage.Attia was among contributors Weiss brought in at CBS to share their expertise on a range of topics, from health to national security.Weiss, a former New York Times opinion writer, was appointed to her new role as part of a bid by the broadcaster's new owner to reshape it.Weiss, who started her career working at Jewish news outlets, is known for her criticism of \"cancel culture\".CBS was taken over by David Ellison, the son of Trump ally and tech billionaire Larry Ellison, in 2025 as part of a wider merger with Paramount. CBS News has a partnership agreement with the BBC, meaning news content including video footage can be shared. BBC News is editorially independent of CBS.",

    "body": "14 hours agoIan AikmanEPACharles Kusher was appointed US Ambassador to France last yearThe French foreign ministry says US envoy Charles Kushner should be blocked from access to the government after he failed to explain comments about an alleged \"rise\" in violence in France.Kushner, father of Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, had been summoned to meet French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot on Monday evening, but did not attend.Instead, he said he had a prior engagement and sent a deputy from the US embassy.This prompted an angry response from the ministry, which accused Kushner of an \"apparent failure to grasp the basic requirements of the ambassadorial mission\" and said Barrot had requested Kushner \"no longer be allowed direct access\" to government ministers.The diplomatic row began when the US embassy in France posted comments on social media about the murder of far-right nationalist Quentin Deranque.The post warned that \"violent left-wing extremism is on the rise\" in France. Deranque, a 23-year-old maths student, died in hospital on 14 February - two days after being beaten by a gang of masked young men in Lyon, in an attack which ministers from France's centre-right government blamed on \"far-left\" militants.But the US embassy's comments appear to have angered the French government.\"We reject any use of this tragedy, which has plunged a French family into mourning, for political ends,\" Barrot said over the weekend. \"We have no lessons to learn, particularly on the issue of violence, from the international reactionary movement.\"BBC News has approached the US embassy in France for comment.AFPQuentin Deranque came under attack near an event by a leading radical left politician in LyonSix men suspected of being involved in the fatal assault have been charged over Deranque's death, while a parliamentary assistant for a deputy from the radical left France Unbowed (LFI) party has also been charged with complicity.LFI leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who is a likely contender in next year's presidential election, has said his party had \"nothing to do with this story\" and condemned \"all forms of violence\".\"We express our consternation, but also our empathy and compassion for [Deranque's] family and friends,\" he said.",

A motive has not yet been established.Russian Investigative Committee spokeswoman Svetlana Petrenko said the suspect and the police officer both died at the scene.\"The identity of the man is being determined,\" Petrenko said, adding that the committee was also looking into whether the perpetrator had any accomplices.An unnamed source told Moscow-based station Ren TV that the attacker was a Russian citizen.Officials have given no additional information regarding the explosive device so far.The attacker approached officers from the north-eastern district of Moscow, the Interior Ministry said in a statement.A criminal case has been opened against the perpetrator for the attempt on the life of a law enforcement officer and charges relating to the explosive device. Law enforcement agencies were working in tandem to \"establish all the circumstances\", the ministry added.The two injured officers were taken to hospital \"with various injuries\" following the explosion.Medical sources told news agency Tass the officers were in a serious condition.The ministry identified the officer who was killed as 34-year-old Police Lieutenant Denis Bratuschenko, a senior inspector in the traffic police.

    "body": "28 minutes agoJamie WhiteheadBBC News ReutersHong Kong has formally complained to the government of Panama after it took control of two ports on the Panama Canal. It accused the Panamanian authorities of taking them over by force.The ports had been run by a Hong Kong-based company, CK Hutchison, for more than two decades.Last month, Panama's Supreme Court annulled the contracts which allowed the firm to operate the container ports, saying they were \"unconstitutional\".The ruling followed claims by US President Donald Trump that China was operating the canal. There is no public evidence to suggest this.Hong Kong's government said, in a statement, it was lodging a \"strong protest\" after Panama's \"blatant act\" undermined both the \"spirit of the contracts\" and  \"international trade rules\". Last year, the Hong Kong-based company agreed to sell most of its stake in the two ports to a group led by the US investment firm BlackRock. The move by the Panamanian government could disrupt the $22.8bn (£20.75bn) sale, according to the Reuters news agency.President Trump has repeatedly claimed that the Central American canal is under Chinese control.During his inauguration address last January, he said: \"China is operating the Panama Canal and we didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we're taking it back.\"The following month, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also demanded that Panama make \"immediate changes\" to what he called the \"influence and control\" of China over the canal.There is no public evidence to suggest China exercises control over the canal, though Chinese companies have a significant presence there.Up to 14,000 ships use the 51-mile (82km) Panama Canal each year as a shortcut between the Atlantic and Pacific.The waterway, which handles about 5% of global maritime trade volume, is operated by the Panama Canal Authority, an agency of the Panamanian government.From October 2023 to September 2024, China accounted for 21.4% of the cargo volume transiting the canal, making it the second-largest user after the US.",

The bus had been travelling from Pokhara, a popular tourist spot.Nepal's Home Ministry has created a five-member taskforce to investigate the cause of the incident. The UK Foreign Office said it was assisting the family of the Briton who was killed.Nepalese authorities identified him as Stewart Dominic Ethan. His name has not been confirmed by the Foreign Office.Nepalese police say they have identified all 19 bodies, including a 40-year-old Chinese woman and a 32-year-old man from India. Among the injured is a Chinese national and a New Zealander.All the injured had been taken to hospitals in the capital, they added. Children were among those onboard.Multiple teams were sent to the site, including police units, the army and a rescue team of divers, authorities said.Police spokesman Abinarayan Kafle said 17 people died at the scene, with two more dying while receiving treatment, BBC Nepali reported.Road accidents are relatively commonplace in Nepal, due to a range of factors including poor road maintenance and narrow paths in mountainous areas.In 2024, at least 14 people died after a bus travelling from Pokhara to Kathmandu fell into the Marsyangdi river in the Tanahun district.\"We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Nepal and are in contact with the local authorities,\" a Foreign Office spokesman told the BBC.Nepal is a popular destination for many international visitors, especially climbers, who travel there to access a key section of the Himalaya mountain range that includes Mount Everest.",

    "body": "Probe under way after illness kills 72 tigers in Thai tourist park4 hours agoKoh EweAnadolu Agency via Getty ImagesAt Tiger Kingdom Chiang Mai, visitors can touch and interact with tigersAuthorities in Chiang Mai, a city in northern Thailand, are investigating the deaths of dozens of tigers at a popular tourist attraction.Seventy-two tigers died in the span of less than two weeks this month, across two facilities of Tiger Kingdom Chiang Mai, a park where visitors can touch and interact with the big cats.The local livestock department said samples from the tigers showed canine distemper virus - though authorities have not confirmed how the outbreak happened.Officials told a news conference on Tuesday the virus was no longer spreading and no more tigers were dying. No humans had been infected, they added.The remains of the tigers have all been buried and a recommendation was made for the gravely ill tigers be euthanised, authorities said.The big cats were among more than 240 tigers living across the two facilities at Tiger Kingdom Chiang Mai, according to local media.Canine distemper virus is a highly contagious disease that attacks the host's respiratory, gastrointestinal and nervous systems. While it is typically found among dogs, it can also infect big cats.Besides canine distemper virus, the provincial livestock office in Chiang Mai said last week that samples from the tigers' carcasses also tested positive for a bacteria associated with respiratory disease.\"By the time we realised they were sick, it was already too late,\" Somchuan Ratanamungklanon, director of the national livestock department, previously told local media - noting that it was harder to detect sickness in tigers compared to animals like common household cats or dogs.Somchuan told reporters on Tuesday that officials had collected samples from the tigers' bodies, the chicken they eat and their surroundings.The provincial livestock office had earlier said preliminary tests showed the tigers had been infected with feline parvovirus. Some local officials had also initially suspected the outbreak might have stemmed from contaminated raw chicken meat fed to the tigers, the Bangkok Post reported.Raw chicken was also suspected as the cause of a major bird flu outbreak at a tiger zoo in Chonburi province in 2004. In that case, nearly 150 tigers died or were euthanised to prevent further spread of the influenza.The disease control department said over the weekend that, while none of the veterinarians or other staff working in the Chiang Mai tiger enclosures had fallen ill from canine distemper virus, they had been placed under observation for 21 days, Thai PBS reported.Animal rights groups say this case highlights the poor living conditions of captive tigers used for entertainment in Thailand. Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand said in a statement that the tigers' deaths exposed the \"extreme vulnerability of captive wildlife facilities to infectious disease\".\"Tragedies like this would be far less likely to happen\" if tourists \"stayed away\" from these attractions, Peta Asia said in a statement.Tiger Kingdom Chiang Mai has been temporarily closed for two weeks as officials carry out disinfection work.",

It's really hard to face this reality about an old friend.\"Born on 24 March 1954, Carradine was the youngest son of John Carradine and a brother of actors David and Keith Carradine.Encouraged by his brother David, Robert Carradine auditioned for 1972's The Cowboys, a John Wayne film that became his first screen role. He went on to appear in and Martin Scorsese's 1973 film Mean Streets, Oscar-winning Coming Home (1978), alongside Jane Fonda, The Long Riders (1980), with Mark Hamill, The Big Red One (1980) and Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained in 2012.AlamyCarradine (second right) played Hilary Duff's father in the early-2000s Disney Channel series Lizzie McGuireBut he was best known for playing the head nerd, Lewis Skolnick, in Revenge of the Nerds - which became one of the most popular film franchises of the 1980s, and the father of Lizzie McGuire in the noughties Disney Channel series.Paying tribute, Lizzie McGuire star Duff said: \"There was so much warmth in the McGuire family and I always felt so cared for by my on-screen parents. \"I'll be forever grateful for that. I'm deeply sad to learn Bobby was suffering. My heart aches for him, his family, and everyone who loved him.\"In a statement, Carradine's family announced his death \"with profound sadness\", adding that the US actor was a \"beloved father, grandfather, uncle, and brother\".\"In a world that can feel so dark, Bobby was always a beacon on light to everyone around him,\" they said.\"We are bereft at the loss of this beautiful soul and want to acknowledge Bobby's valiant struggle against his nearly two-decade battle with bipolar disorder. \"We hope his journey can shine a light and encourage addressing the stigma that attaches to mental illness.\"The statement added: \"At this time we ask for the privacy to grieve this unfathomable loss. With gratitude for your understanding and compassion.\"In his own separate statement to Deadline, Carradine's brother Keith added: \"It is an illness that got the best of him, and I want to celebrate him for his struggle with it, and celebrate his beautiful soul. \"He was profoundly gifted, and we will miss him every day. We will take solace in how funny he could be, how wise and utterly accepting and tolerant he was. That's who my baby brother was.\"",

    "body": "Kim Jong Un re-appointed leader of North Korea's ruling party1 day agoKoh EweAFP via Getty ImagesKim Jong Un vowed to boost the country's economy and people's standard of living in his opening speech to the congressNorth Korea's ruling Workers' Party has again chosen Kim Jong Un to be its general secretary, state media report.The announcement, which was made at a rubber-stamp party congress in Pyongyang on Sunday, comes as little surprise given the Kim family has ruled by dictatorship since the late 1940s.State-run KCNA said that under Kim's leadership North Korea \"radically improved\" its \"war deterrence\", \"with the nuclear forces as its pivot\".Despite long-standing international sanctions, North Korea has continued to build its nuclear capabilities, regularly testing banned intercontinental missiles. But the secrecy of the regime makes it harder to evaluate how much progress the military has made.  Kim, who took control of the regime after his father's death in 2011, has invested heavily in the nuclear weapons programme, turning Pyongyang into a far bigger challenge for the West, and especially the US.  He is expected to announce the next phase of the country's weapons programme during the Ninth Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea, which began on 19 February and is now in its fourth day. Before it started, North Korea unveiled what it said was a range of nuclear-capable rocket launchers.The congress has been held once every five years in the last decade.With some 5,000 party members in attendance, according to KCNA, it offers a rare glimpse into the structure of political power in North Korea, which remains quite opaque to even the keenest watchers.The meetings are considered to be the most important political event and provide insight into where the country's priorities lie, from foreign policy to its nuclear ambitions.While Kim has remained at the top of North Korean leadership, the party congress' presidium, or executive committee, has been reshuffled since the last meeting in 2021. More than half of its 39 members have been replaced, according to state media.In his opening speech last week, Kim vowed to boost the country's economy and people's standard of living, which he described as \"heavy and urgent historic tasks\".All eyes are on whether Kim's daughter, Ju Ae, will make an appearance at the congress.Earlier this month, South Korea's spy agency said that Kim had chosen Ju Ae as his heir. Believed to be 13 years old, she has become an increasingly prominent figure at official events, inspecting missiles and attending Beijing's military parade with her father.Chinese president Xi Jinping called Kim to congratulate him on his re-appointment on Monday, saying he would work with Kim to \"write a new chapter in the China-North Korea friendship\", Chinese state media reported.Beijing has long been Pyongyang's most significant ally: it is North Korea's largest trade partner and source of aid. But at the same time, China is wary of Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions, which could destabilise the region, and its growing ties with Vladimir Putin's Russia.",

    "body": "2 days agoRachel Muller-HeyndykGetty ImagesThe US operates two dedicated hospital boats, including the USNS Mercy Greenland's prime minister has asked US President Donald Trump to talk to him instead of making \"random outbursts on social media\", after Trump said he was sending a US hospital boat to \"take care\" of people on the island.Trump wrote on Truth Social that he was going to send a boat filled with medical supplies, alleging \"many people\" on the island are sick and \"not being taken care of\".Jens-Frederik Nielsen responded \"it's going to be a no thanks from us,\" and said that Greenland provides free healthcare for all citizens, unlike the US. Trump has long coveted the vast arctic island - but conceded in January that he would not take it by force, after previously refusing to rule out doing so. He later announced a \"framework for a future deal\" around the US and Greenland, after Denmark and Nato allies made it clear that they would not give in to his calls to relinquish sovereignty.In his post on social media, Trump said that he and his Greenland envoy Jeff Landry were \"going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there. It's on the way!!!\"The post included what appeared to be an illustrated or AI image of the USNS Mercy, one of two hospital ships operated by the US navy. It is not clear if Trump was referencing either of those ships, or what had prompted his decision. Responding to the post, Nielsen said that Trump's idea \"is noted. But we have a public healthcare system where treatment is free for citizens.\"\"It's not like that in the United States, where it costs money to go to the doctor,\" he wrote on Facebook.Nielsen added that Greenland remained open to cooperating with the US but underlined the importance of discussing issues directly.\"Talk to us instead of just making more or less random outbursts on social media,\" he said.Trump's post came soon after Denmark's Joint Arctic Command said it had evacuated a crew member who required urgent medical treatment from a US submarine close to Nuuk. It is not clear if Trump's post was related to the incident.A month on from Trump announcing a \"framework for a future deal\" over Greenland, details are still unclear, though earlier this month US vice president JD Vance alleged that European countries were \"willing to make a lot of accommodations\".",

    "body": "Australian prosecutors consider reopening British girl's cold case disappearance1 day agoKaty WatsonAustralia correspondentFamily handoutCheryl Grimmer was three when she disappeared from Fairy Meadow beach in January 1970The family of a British girl who disappeared in Australia more than 55 years ago has welcomed a decision by prosecutors to consider reopening her case.Three-year-old Cheryl Grimmer disappeared from Fairy Meadow beach in Wollongong in January 1970. Despite extensive searches, there were no leads.A suspect was charged with her abduction and murder in 2017, but his trial collapsed after his teenage confession was ruled inadmissible. He denies any wrongdoing and prosecutors dropped the case.After public pressure - including from the girl's family - the New South Wales (NSW) director of public prosecutions now says her office is willing to conduct a special review of that decision.Sally Dowling said in a letter to Grimmer's family that the normal time limit for families to request a review had expired, but that she had agreed to look at the case anyway.She said she could review the case now, based on evidence police handed over in 2019, or the family could wait until detectives had considered the \"fresh\" information they say they have found.\"It's taken way too many years but finally we're really happy that they see our fight for some justice for Cheryl,\" Ricki Nash, Cheryl's older brother, told the BBC.Nash said the family had written to NSW Police to request it reopen an investigation, taking into account new evidence that had come to light since 2019.\"We are not asking for anything extraordinary,\" he said. \"When transparency leads the process, evil can no longer hide behind process failures or bureaucratic division.\"The British toddler and her family had only recently migrated to Australia from Bristol as so-called Ten Pound Poms before she vanished.On the day Cheryl disappeared, Nash had been put in charge of his younger siblings as the family got ready to leave the beach. He was told to go to the bathroom block and Cheryl ran giggling into the ladies' changing rooms, refusing to come out.Too embarrassed to enter himself, Nash went back to the beach to tell his mother to help. When they returned 90 seconds later, the toddler was gone.Cheryl's family has been pushing for a fresh investigation ever since the trial collapsed seven years ago. They argue that lots of missteps were made by NSW authorities in their search for Cheryl.Last October, Jeremy Buckingham, a member of the NSW Legislative Council, the state's upper house, used parliamentary privilege to name the suspect. He had been known only as Mercury, as his real name is legally protected because he was a minor at the time of the alleged crime.In May, there will also be a NSW parliamentary inquiry looking into cases of unsolved murders and long-term missing people – with Grimmer's case forming part of the inquiry.",

    "body": "2 days agoOttilie MitchellandYama Bariz,BBC AfghanAFP via Getty ImagesIslamabad said the strikes were launched on Afghanistan following recent suicide bombings in PakistanPakistan has carried out multiple overnight air strikes on Afghanistan, which the Taliban has said killed at least 18 people, including women and children.Islamabad said the attacks targeted seven alleged militant camps and hideouts near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and that they had been launched after recent suicide bombings in Pakistan.Afghanistan condemned the attacks, saying they targeted multiple civilian homes and a religious school. The fresh strikes come after the two countries agreed to a fragile ceasefire in October following deadly cross-border clashes, though subsequent fighting has taken place.The Taliban's defence ministry said the strikes targeted civilian areas of Nangarhar and Paktika provinces and had killed dozens of people.In Girdi Kas village, in the Bihsud district of Nangarhar, a man named Shahabuddin told reporters while pointing at his destroyed house that of 23 members of his family, only five had survived the attack. Local Taliban spokesman Sayed Taib Hamd said that 18 members of the family had been killed.The BBC had earlier been told about 20 people were thought to have died. No deaths have been reported so far in the other areas hit. A guesthouse and a religious school were targeted in the Bermal and Urgun districts of Paktika province, but they were empty at the time of the attacks, local officials and locals told the BBC.AFP via Getty ImagesHouses were also destroyed in Balish village in the Urgun district of Paktika province (pictured)Pakistan's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said it had carried out \"intelligence based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts\".In a statement on X, it said the targets included members of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, which the government refers to as \"Fitna al Khawarij,\" along with their affiliates and the Islamic State-Khorasan Province.The ministry described the strikes as \"a retributive response\" to recent suicide bombings in Pakistan by terror groups it said were sheltered by Kabul.The recent attacks in Pakistan included one on a Shia mosque in the capital Islamabad earlier this month, as well as others that took place since the holy month of Ramadan began this week in the north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Pakistan accused the Afghan Taliban of failing to take action against the militants, adding that it had \"conclusive evidence\" that the attacks were carried out by militants on the instructions of their leadership in Afghanistan.The Taliban's defence ministry later posted on X condemning the attacks as a \"blatant violation of Afghanistan's territorial integrity\", adding that they were a \"clear breach of international law\".It warned that \"an appropriate and measured response will be taken at a suitable time\", adding that \"attacks on civilian targets and religious institutions indicate the failure of Pakistan's army in intelligence and security.\"The strikes come days after Saudi Arabia mediated the release of three Pakistani soldiers earlier this week, who were captured in Kabul during border clashes last October.Pakistan and Afghanistan share a 1,600-mile (2,574 km) mountainous border.",

    "body": "1 day agoKhanyisile NgcoboJohannesburgReutersBellarmine Mugabe is due to reappear in court next week for a bail hearingThe youngest son of Zimbabwe's late former President Robert Mugabe has been formally charged with attempted murder at a brief appearance in a South African court.Bellarmine Mugabe, 28, was arrested last week after a 23-year-old man was shot and injured at a property in an upmarket suburb of Johannesburg last Thursday. He was then taken into custody alongside his bodyguard - neither man has commented on the charges.Appearing in court, dressed in black, Mugabe looked calm during the proceedings.Bellarmine is the youngest son of Robert and his second wife Grace Mugabe. Robert Mugabe, who died in 2019, led Zimbabwe for 37 years before being forced out of power at the age of 93 in 2017.Searching the property in Hyde Park where the shooting happened, police have found bullet cartridges but no firearm so far.Mugabe and Tobias Tamirepi Matonhodze, 33, also face additional charges, including defeating the ends of justice, which relates to the missing firearm, prosecutors say.The victim is in hospital and in a critical condition.Speaking outside court, Mugabe's lawyer Sinenhlanhla Mnguni provided an update on his well-being, telling reporters his client was \"fine\" as he remains in custody. Describing the circumstances of the shooting, prosecutors allege that \"an altercation occurred between the victim and the accused inside Mugabe's home\".While attempting to flee the victim was then allegedly \"shot in the back and collapsed outside the gate\" and the gate was then closed, according to a statement from the National Prosecuting Authority.The case against Mugabe and Matonhodze was postponed until 3 March when a bail application will be made.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "1 hour agoThomas Naadi,BBC Africa, AccraandWycliffe MuiaGetty ImagesEmmanuel Kwasi Kotoka was one of a group of officers who orchestrated the coup while Nkrumah was on a visit to Asia Ghana's government has removed the name of a coup leader, who helped overthrow founding father Kwame Nkrumah exactly 60 years ago, from the country's main airport.Kotoka International Airport will now be known as Accra International Airport, its original name. But the move has not been without controversy.Emmanuel Kwasi Kotoka was among a group of officers who deposed Nkrumah in 1966. He himself was killed at the airport the following year during a failed counter-coup attempt.The military government then renamed it in 1969 in his honour, portraying him as a \"liberator\" from what they saw as Nkrumah's authoritarian rule. But some argued his name contradicts Ghana's democratic values.The transport ministry said the government \"considered it appropriate\" to restore the earlier name. Critics of the move, including Kotoka's family, said it erased his legacy and service.Transport Minister Joseph Bukari Nikpe has been quoted in local media as saying that the change was aimed at projecting a neutral national image and reflecting the name of the capital city, Accra.But some have questioned the cost and asked why issues like unemployment and living conditions are not more of a priority for the government.In arguing for the move, some civil society groups said that honouring Kotoka fundamentally contradicted the country's democratic values and glorified an unconstitutional change of government.This view has gained traction under current President John Mahama, who returned to power after the December 2024 election, and the debate has intensified over the past month.Among those who have opposed the name change is parliament's minority leader Alexander Afenyo-Markin, who called it a betrayal of the Volta Region, Kotoka's home.He argued that the name was one of the few national honours recognising the eastern region.The discussions have spilled over to social media, with Ghanaians divided over the legal, social and political implications of changing the airport's name.But in its statement on Monday, the transport ministry called on the public and international partners to support and co-operate with the relevant authorities to ensure what it described as a \"smooth and seamless transition\".The authorities have assured the public that the name change will not affect airport operations, safety standards or international travel. In the build up to the 1966 coup, Nkrumah had faced criticism that he was becoming increasingly oppressive.Historians have debated the role the West, particularly the US's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), played in unseating Ghana's first president.As well as leading Ghana to independence in 1957, Nkrumah was seen as a visionary in the pan-African liberation movement.After his overthrow, Ghanaians lived through several coups up until the return of multiparty democracy in 1992.Since then there has been a series of closely fought elections and peaceful transfers of power.More about Ghana from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

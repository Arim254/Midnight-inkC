    "body": "More than 100 people have had to shelter in a shrine on a mountain top in Japan after heavy snowfall cut off access by road.Around 130 people were forced to spend the night in the halls and lobbies of the Mitsumine Shrine in the Saitama prefecture on Friday after the roads around it were closed due to safety concerns, public broadcaster NHK reports.The local authority confirmed the occupants of around 50 cars had stayed in the shrine building, and said no one had fallen ill.Japan is experiencing heavy snowfall at present, with up to 40cm forecast to fall in some parts on Saturday.Up to 80cm of snow has fallen in some parts of the country in the past 72 hours, data from the Japan Meteorological Agency shows, with more predicted to fall as a cold front persists.Several accidents around the Mitsumine Shrine including cars slipping had prompted the road closure, NHK reported, citing local police.Up to 4cm of snow has fallen in the region, while temperatures as low as -15C have made for icy conditions.Located 1,110m (3,640 ft) above sea level in the mountains near the city of Chichibu, the Mitsumine Shrine is a popular centre for Shinto worship and is dedicated to Izanami and Izanagi, the divine couple credited with creating the Japanese islands.The shrine is said to have been founded in the 1st Century by Prince Yamato Takeru no Mikoto, son of Emperor Keikō.",

    "body": "11 hours agoTom McArthurandNick JohnsonGetty ImagesThe managers of a bar where a fire killed 40 people and injured another 119 have been placed under criminal investigation, Swiss prosecutors have said. The French couple - named by the media as Jacques and Jessica Moretti - are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office in Valais said. Eight Swiss nationals from among those killed were the first to be identified on Saturday. The likely cause of the fire at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana was sparklers on bottles being carried too close to the ceiling, a preliminary investigation found. In a statement, Beatrice Pilloud, the lead prosecutor in the canton of Valais, said investigators were looking into whether the venue's acoustic foam was \"the cause of the problem\", as well as \"whether it complies with regulations\".Among the dead and missing are many teenagers. Le Constellation was a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16. A teenage golfer from Italy was the first death to be named, though Swiss and Italian officials have so far declined to confirm his death.Swiss authorities have not released the names of the eight people whose identification was completed on Saturday - all aged 16-24. Bunches of flowers, soft toys and messages of love and hope are piled up outside the police barriers outside the bar.On Saturday, families were being directed to a conference centre just outside Crans. Members of the Italian Civil Protection team met people there, together with Italy's Ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado.Ambassador Cornado said the identification process should be completed by Sunday afternoon.The slow process is because of the severity of the burns many of the victims suffered, the ambassador added.A helpline has been set up for concerned families: +41 848 112 117",

    "body": "Two people including a three-year-old child have been killed and around 28 others injured in a Russian strike on Kharkiv, Ukrainian officials have said. A multi-storey residential apartment block was almost completely destroyed in the dual missile attack on Friday afternoon, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called \"heinous\". Russia's Defence Ministry denied reports of an attack, suggesting the blast had been caused by Ukrainian ammunition detonating.The strike comes ahead of crunch talks on a US-brokered peace plan in Kyiv on Saturday.Zelensky says around 15 countries are expected to attend the talks, along with representatives from the EU and Nato, with a US delegation joining the meeting via video link. Leaders of the so-called coalition of the willing are then set to meet in France on 6 January.Officials in Kharkiv said the bodies of a woman and a three-year-old child were found in the rubble, with preliminary information suggesting the pair may have been a mother and son. \"Unfortunately, this is how the Russians treat life and people – they continue killing, despite all efforts by the world, and especially by the United States, in the diplomatic process,\" Zelensky wrote on X.Of the 28 injured, which included a six-month-old baby, 16 have been taken to hospital. A search and rescue operation is ongoing, with more than 80 volunteers working at the scene, according to regional governor Oleh Syniehubov.The Russian Defence Ministry said in a statement on Telegram that its armed forces \"neither planned nor launched attacks using missile weapons or aircraft weapons within the city of Kharkiv\".It added that footage from before the attack showed \"heavy smoke of unknown origin\", which it cited as evidence of ammunition detonated by Ukrainian armed forces.The ministry also alleged that the reports were seeking to distract attention from a New Year's Eve strike on a hotel in a Russian-held part of the southern Kherson region of Ukraine.Russia has accused Ukraine of killing at least 27 people and injuring more than 30 others in the drone strike on a New Year's party in the village of Khorly on the Black Sea.The BBC has not been able to independently verify either these claims or the number of casualties.Ukraine told the BBC it would not directly respond to sources of information such as claims from governors of occupied regions.It added that it adhered to the norms of international humanitarian law and conducted strikes exclusively against military targets.Russia's Investigative Committee said it had opened an investigation into the attack, while the Russian foreign ministry accused Zelensky of \"seeking to intimidate the populations of the reunited Russian regions, who have forever linked their fates with Russia through referendums\".",

    "body": "1 day agoClaire KeenanWatch: Earthquake interrupts Mexico's president during press conferenceAt least two people have died after a powerful earthquake hit southern and central Mexico on Friday.The epicentre of the 6.5 magnitude earthquake was near the popular tourist town of Acapulco, near San Marcos in the south-western state of Guerrero, which suffered moderate damage.A 50-year-old woman died in Guerrero, the state's governor Evelyn Salgado said, while Clara Brugada, Mexico City's mayor, confirmed the death of a 60-year-old man and said 12 others had been injured in the capital. Mexico is situated in one of the world's most seismically active areas, sitting at the meeting point of four tectonic plates.Late on Friday night, Brugada said power has been restored to \"98% of the failures reported\" in Mexico City.Two structures were being evaluated for risk of collapse, she said, while 34 buildings and five homes were being inspected as a preventative measure.Damage assessments are under way in Mexico City after roads and hospitals were impacted, according to news agency Reuters, while authorities noted various landslides on highways around the Guerrero state. Mexico's seismological service had registered 420 aftershocks by midday local time (18:00 GMT).President Claudia Sheinbaum was holding her first press conference of the year when the earthquake struck.  In a video capturing the moment, Sheinbaum can be heard saying \"it's shaking\" as an earthquake alert system rings in the background. She then tells the media to \"all get out calmly\". Additional footage shows buildings shaking in Mexico City and cars trembling in Acapulco.Getty ImagesThe inside of a house damaged by the quake in San Marcos, Guerrero state, MexicoAfter hearing the Mexican Seismic Alert System early on Friday, residents and tourists rushed into the streets of Mexico City and Acapulco.The seismic system was put into place following the deadly 1985 earthquake that claimed more than 10,000 lives.In 2017, a 7.1 magnitude quake killed more than 200 people and toppled dozens of buildings in Mexico City.",

    "body": "Donald Trump's warning that the US will intervene if peaceful protesters are killed was \"reckless and dangerous\", Iran's foreign minister has said.Abbas Araghchi's comments came after the US president said Washington \"will come to their rescue\" in reference to demonstrators taking part in protests over Iran's economy, writing in a brief social media post: \"We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"Araghchi indicated Iran's armed forces were on standby and \"know exactly where to aim\" in the event of an attack.At least eight people are reported to have died during the week-long protests, as of Saturday morning.Trump wrote on Friday: \"If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"The US president did not specify what action Washington might take. Previously, it has carried out strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, which elicited a retaliatory strike on a US base in Qatar.\"Given President Trump's deployment of the National Guard within US borders, he of all people should know that criminal attacks on public property cannot be tolerated,\" Araghchi wrote on X.Iran would \"forcefully reject any interference in their internal affairs\", he added.On Saturday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei addressed the wave of protests, saying that \"rioters must be put in their place\". He said shopkeepers' original protest about the collapse in foreign exchange rates was \"legitimate\", but he claimed people \"provoked by the enemy\" were taking advantage to shout anti-government slogans.Protests have spread to a number of cities and towns with running battles reported between security forces and demonstrators. On Saturday the state-affiliated Mehr and Fars news agencies reported that two protesters and a member of the security forces were killed in the western town of Malekshahi when, they said, protesters tried to enter a police station.The EU said it was \"concerned\" by reports of deaths and called for Tehran to exercise \"maximum restraint\" against the protesters as well as upholding their right to \"freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly\".The protests began in Tehran, with shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and the protests had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.Two people have since died in clashes between protesters and security forces in the south-western city of Lordegan, according to the semi-official Fars news agency and the human rights group Hengaw, which said they were protesters, naming them as Ahmad Jalil and Sajjad Valamanesh.Three people were killed in Azna, while another died in Kouhdasht, all in the west of the country, Fars reported. It did not specify whether they were demonstrators or security forces personnel.One death was reported in Fuladshahr, central Iran, and another casualty in Marvdasht, in the south.BBC has not been able to independently verify the deaths.The demonstrations have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly, but they have not been on the same scale.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has previously said he will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.

IS imposed jihadist rule over parts of Syria and Iraq until 2019.\"This action shows our UK leadership, and determination to stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies, to stamp out any resurgence of Daesh and their dangerous and violent ideologies in the Middle East,\" UK Defence Secretary John Healey said.EPA/ShutterstockThe MoD said no civilians were harmed in the strikesRAF aircraft have carried out patrols over Syria to \"prevent any attempted resurgence\" of IS following its defeat at the battle of Baghuz in 2019, the ministry said.\"I want to thank all the members of our armed forces involved in this operation for their professionalism and their courage,\" Healey said.\"They were among thousands of British personnel deployed over Christmas and New Year. This operation, to eliminate dangerous terrorists who threaten our way of life, shows how our armed forces are ready to step up, all year round, keeping Britain secure at home and strong abroad.\" The RAF has been using aerial drones and manned aircraft to strike IS fighters and targets as part of the international coalition since 2014. The United Nations says IS still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.In November, Syria - under the leadership of new President Ahmed al-Sharaa - became the 90th country to join a US-led coalition to combat the group.The coalition, officials say, is aimed at eliminating remaining elements of the so-called Islamic State and stemming the flow of foreign militants to the Middle East.Last month, the US military carried out what it called a \"massive strike\" against IS targets in Syria, following an ambush that killed two American soldiers and a civilian interpreter in Palmyra.",

    "body": "'A long road ahead': Venezuelans react to Maduro's arrest with hope and worry5 hours agoGrace Eliza Goodwin,Cristobal VasquezandTom Bateman,State department correspondentReutersAs the dust settles in Caracas, Venezuelans are reacting to the news of President Nicolás Maduro's capture by the US with hope, fear, and uncertainty. People began to emerge in the streets Saturday after a night rocked by explosions in the Caracas Valley, with moods that ranged from celebration to condemnation.  Dina, a local resident, told the BBC that for now, she is grateful to the US for \"taking Maduro out of here\" because now, she \"at least can see some light at the end of the tunnel again\". But the political climate remains tense, part of why she did not give the BBC her real name. Jorge, another Venezuelan who lives near Caracas, told the BBC that while he's grateful to be \"well-supported by Trump and the entire United States\", he fears the coming days will not be easy. \"Now that they are taking this man away, what's going to happen?\" Jorge told the BBC. \"It doesn't guarantee us anything. So there is a bit of uncertainty. We don't know what the coming days will bring.\"Supporters of Maduro's government have also been rallying in the streets of Caracas, demanding the US release their leader. Caracas Mayor Carmen Meléndez, a firm government loyalist, joined in the rally to protest against what she called Maduro's \"kidnapping\". Early Saturday, US forces under President Donald Trump carried out a series of targeted attacks in Venezuela's capital, ultimately taking the country's leader into US custody. The US accuses Maduro of running a \"narco-terrorist\" regime. He is widely seen by opponents within his country as well as by foreign governments as having illegitimately won Venezuela's 2024 election. Maduro - who leads the United Socialist Party and has been in power since 2013 - has frequently been accused of repressing opposition groups and silencing dissent in Venezuela, at times with the use of violence.As Maduro and his wife are extradited to New York City to face drug trafficking and weapons charges, the future of Venezuela remains unclear. Trump has said the US will run the country - and manage its oil reserves - until a permanent replacement for Maduro can be established. Maduro has previously rejected US claims he has direct involvement in drug trafficking.But even for those who are grateful to see Maduro gone, there's still a lot of fear and uncertainty, several Venezuelans told the BBC.Dina isn't putting much faith in Trump. \"He says something now and tomorrow he changes his mind,\" Dina said of Trump. \"I mean, I'm not used to taking his words seriously.\"The \"only thing that was good\" about what Trump has said since Maduro's capture, Dina said, is that the US will be investing in Venezuela, which she hopes will lead to \"a better economic situation\" for the struggling country. Venezuela VP: Maduro is 'the only president'The danger of speaking out against Maduro is still very real within Venezuela, as the National Assembly - which is dominated by Maduro loyalists - passed a law a few weeks ago declaring anyone who expresses support for US naval blockades a \"traitor\".Jorge said he saw motorcyclists from colectivos, which are pro-government paramilitary groups in Venezuela, roaming the streets with weapons yesterday. \"It makes you a bit afraid to even go out to buy bread right now,\" he said. \"We'll have to wait for the best and have patience.\"Jorge added that he's worried about the influence of Maduro's ally, Diosdado Cabello, Venezuela's Minister of Interior, Justice and Peace.\"He is a very bad person, very spiteful,\" Jorge said of Cabello. \"I don't know how many people he has on his side. Hopefully, the army stands with the people and he loses some control.\"Sandra echoed Jorge and Dina's relief at Maduro's ousting. But, she too is skeptical about the future and what it means for Venezuelans in exile. Close to eight million Venezuelans have left Venezuela since Maduro came to power - and many of them have been openly celebrating Maduro's capture in the streets of the cities where they have settled.In addition to the millions in exile, others are \"missing, imprisoned, dead, or merely surviving\", — which is \"a true tragedy that had not been addressed by any country\", Sandra said. \"This is only the beginning; we know there is still a long road ahead,\" Sandra added. \"No country had previously heard the cry of Venezuelans in the face of this tragedy\".

He led a long life and no doubt fathered many calves,\" said the Amboseli Trust for Elephants in its farewell message.Famed for his long tusks, Craig the elephant was a major attraction at the park near the Tanzanian border. In 2021, he was named an ambassador for the popular Kenyan lager brand Tusker - a name also used for adult male elephants with tusks.The Kenya Wildlife Service described Craig as an \"icon\" of successful conservation.\"Craig was one of the last remaining super tuskers in Africa - a rare class of bull elephants whose two tusks weigh over 45kg (100lb) each. Fewer than a handful remain today, making him a living monument to Africa's natural heritage.\"The wildlife body also said \"Craig was deeply loved for [his] remarkably calm nature\", often \"pausing patiently as visitors photographed and filmed him\". \"Thanks to his many protectors, he died peacefully of natural causes.\"More than two million tourists visited Kenya last year, many of them seeking out wildlife in the country's world-famous national parks.Kenya's tourism sector accounts for 10% of national GDP, officials say.AFP via Getty ImagesCraig the elephant became a brand ambassador for Tusker five years agoYou may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "'Deeply shocked': World leaders react to US attack on Venezuela 2 hours agoClaire KeenanTrump on Venezuela: \"We are going to run the country\"Leaders around the world have responded with a mix of condemnation and support to the US capture of Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro. Following a large-scale strike on Venezuela on Saturday, Maduro and his wife were captured by US forces and removed from the country. The pair have been indicted on drug charges in New York. In an initial response, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his government would \"shed no tears\" for the end of Maduro's regime.Neighbouring Latin American countries condemned the actions, as did Venezuela's long-term allies, Russia and China. China said it was \"deeply shocked and strongly condemns\" the use of force against a sovereign country and its president. Follow updates on this storyRussia accused the US of committing \"an act of armed aggression\".Iran, which is locked in its own dispute with Trump over his promise of intervention in its country, called the strikes a \"flagrant violation of the country's national sovereignty\".Trump said the US will \"run\" Venezuela \"until we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition\". Many Latin American leaders condemned the US actions. Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva wrote on X that the actions \"cross an unacceptable line\", adding that \"attacking countries in flagrant violation of international law is the first step toward a world of violence, chaos, and instability\". Colombian President Gustavo Petro called the strikes an \"assault on the sovereignty\" of Latin America, while Chile's President Gabriel Boric expressed \"concern and condemnation\" and called for \"a peaceful solution to the serious crisis affecting the country\".Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Cane accused the US of a \"criminal attack\", while Uruguay said in an official statement that it was monitoring developments \"with attention and serious concern\" and \"rejects, as it always has, military intervention\".Trump has indicated that Cuba could become part of a broader US policy in the region, calling it a failing nation. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Cuba was a disaster run by incompetent leaders who supported Maduro's administration and that the government in Havana should be concerned.The Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello urged citizens to remain calm and to trust the country's leadership and military, saying \"the world needs to speak out about this attack\" according to news agency Reuters. But Argentinian President Javier Milei – who Trump has described as his \"favourite president\" – wrote \"freedom moves forward\" and \"long live freedom\" on social media.Getty ImagesGovernment supporters hold posters of the late Hugo Chávez (left) and Venezuela's President Nicolás MaduroMeanwhile, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer refused to be drawn into whether or not the military action may have broken international law.He did not condemn the US strikes in an interview with the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme on Saturday morningHe said he was waiting to establish all the facts but would not \"shy away from this\", adding he was a \"lifelong advocate of international law\".The UK was not involved in the strikes and Sir Keir said he had not spoken to Trump about the operation.Later on Saturday, he posted on X that the UK \"regarded Maduro as an illegitimate president and we shed no tears about the end of his regime\".\"The UK government will discuss the evolving situation with US counterparts in the days ahead as we seek a safe and peaceful transition to a legitimate government that reflects the will of the Venezuelan people,\" he added.The EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas reiterated the bloc's position that Maduro lacks legitimacy, that there should be a peaceful transition of power, and that the principles of international law must be respected.French President Emmanuel Macron said the transition of power \"must be peaceful, democratic, and respectful of the will of the Venezuelan people\" in a post on X.He added he hoped González - the opposition's 2024 presidential candidate - could ensure the transition.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the legality of the US operation was \"complex\" and international law in general must apply. He warned that \"political instability must not be allowed to arise in Venezuela\".UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was \"deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected\", his spokesperson said. He was \"deeply alarmed\" by the strikes, which set a \"dangerous precedent\". In the US, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said: \"Let me be clear, Maduro is an illegitimate dictator, but launching military action without congressional authorisation, without a federal plan for what comes next, is reckless.\"Elsewhere, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, a staunch US ally, congratulated Trump on his \"bold and historic leadership on behalf of freedom and justice\". Canada's Foreign Minister Anita Anand said \"Canada calls on all parties to respect international law and we stand by the people of Venezuela and their desire to live in a peaceful and democratic society\". Canada was engaging with international partners, she said. Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said \"international law is universal and binding for all states. \"The American intervention in Venezuela is not in accordance with international law.\" ",

    "body": "The year angry men dominated Bollywood - and what it means for India 1 day agoYasser UsmanFilm writerJio StudiosRanveer Singh's Dhurandhar was the biggest hit last yearFor the Indian film industry, 2025 felt like a return to familiar ground.The year before that, women-led stories had briefly reshaped India's global cinematic image, bringing accolades and new attention. But last year, Bollywood's violent, male-driven action thrillers dominated the domestic box-office and cultural conversations.In the last weeks of 2025, Indian social media was swamped with discussions about a single juggernaut: Dhurandhar, an espionage thriller set in the backdrop of India-Pakistan tensions.Packed with graphic violence and gangland politics, the film became the defining hit of the year, cementing its place in a crop of aggressive, hypermasculine films that drove popular discourse.The trend was a stark contrast to 2024, when a number of films made by women - Payal Kapadia's All We Imagine As Light, Shuchi Talati's Girls Will Be Girls and Kiran Rao's Laapataa Ladies - got global attention and praise. \"What 2024 established was that Indian women filmmakers are not marginal voices, but leading global ones,\" says film critic Mayank Shekhar, calling it \"a moment of truth\" rather than a trend.The hope was that richer, more textured stories about women would grow both in number and popularity. Instead, in 2025 the top 10 box-office hits - five of them from Bollywood, a small relief for a Hindi film industry still struggling to regain its footing after the pandemic - were dominated by larger-than-life, hypermasculine heroes, from the historical epic Chhaava to the action spectacle War 2. The only film on the list led by a woman was an outlier: the Malayalam-language superhero film Lokah.It wasn't just action thrillers that put men at the centre. Blockbuster romance Saiyaara followed a troubled male rockstar who ultimately \"rescues\" his partner who is struggling with Alzheimer's disease. Even mythical spectacles such as Kantara: Chapter 1 (Kannada) and Mahavatar Narsimha (dubbed into several languages) doubled down on traditional male heroism.The year's most talked-about films were dominated by images of men performing pain, power and vengeance at full volume.T Series FilmsTere Ishk Mein was southern superstar Dhanush's biggest Hindi film hitOut of the top 10, one of the year's most debated hits was Tere Ishk Mein, which features an angry, volatile male protagonist and a high-achieving woman whose ambitions are eclipsed by his obsessive love. Despite criticism for romanticising toxic masculinity, the film became actor Dhanush's highest-grossing Hindi release, earning more than 1,550m rupees ($17.26m, £12.77m) worldwide.Another surprise hit was Ek Deewane Ki Deewaniyat, a relatively small-budget romance drama with a hero who, as a review put it, is \"an obsessive lover who refuses to take no for an answer\".2024 offered \"a glimpse of what's possible\", says Priyanka Basu, a senior lecturer in Performing Arts at King's College London.She points out that Hindi cinema has historically marginalised women protagonists, adding that the male-centred industry has long had stark inequalities in casting, pay and opportunities. \"Just one year to change that is unrealistic. We need more such years, and more stories that put women front and centre,\" she says.Indian cinema's, and especially Bollywood's, fixation with the macho hero goes back to Amitabh Bachchan's \"angry young man\" image of the 1970s. Even the romantic era of superstars like Shah Rukh Khan offered only a brief detour - one he has since abandoned in favour of action-heavy blockbusters such as Pathaan and Jawan.The trend has carried onto streaming platforms as well - once seen as alternative spaces where women-centric storytelling could succeed.A recent report by media research company Ormax analysing 338 Hindi shows on streaming platforms showed that action and crime thrillers, mostly male-led, now make up 43% of the titles; female-led stories have fallen from 31% in 2022 to just 12% in 2025.\"At some point, OTT (over-the-top, or streaming) platforms began chasing box-office logic,\" Mr Shekhar says. \"Streaming now mirrors theatrical trends instead of challenging them.\"Wayfarer FilmsLokah, starring Kalyani Priyadarshan, was the only woman-centric film in the year's top 10Trade experts argue that the shift reflects audience demand rather than creative regression in the industry.\"Indian films have traditonally been male-led but we have also had female-centric classics like Mother India and Pakeezah,\" says analyst Taran Adarsh.The accusations of toxicity, he says, come from a \"handful of critics\" and can't change the fate of films.\"At the end of the day, the only verdict that matters is that of the audience,\" he adds.But attributing everything to audience tastes is an oversimplification, argues Anu Singh Choudhary, co-writer of Delhi Crime 3, the third season of a Netflix thriller that highlighted the issue of women-trafficking through a feminist lens.\"Macho blockbusters have existed for long because they reflect a society that's always been patriarchal and male-dominated. Will that change overnight? No. But as the world order changes, so will our films,\" she says.There's also the economic reality. Producers, distributors and exhibitors control the number of screens, marketing and visibility any film gets - and that often depends on the bankability of the male star. Independent and women-led films face an uphill battle, particularly if they are not fronted by big stars.Films nowadays are also going through a \"period of performative, exaggerated misogyny\", says screenwriter Atika Chohan, whose work includes women-led films Chhapaak and Margarita With a Straw.Some of this, she thinks, is a response to the accountability demanded by women during the MeToo movement of 2017-19.While the movement exposed widespread abuse within the film industry, its impact was uneven. Some of the accused faced temporary setbacks, but most returned to work and structural power imbalances largely remain.\"As long as these [hypermasculine] films make money, they aren't going anywhere,\" Ms Chohan says.But as always, there are signs of hope, mostly from smaller, regional film industries and independent filmmakers. A new generation of independent filmmakers in India is making \"riveting, viable cinema\" instead of \"mass entertainers,\" Ms Choudhary points out.Sharp indies such as Sabar Bonda and Songs of Forgotten Trees dug into complex social and political layers and told sensitive stories of relationships. The Telugu film The Girlfriend told the story of a woman in a toxic relationship learning to free herself, while Bad Girl (Tamil) was hailed as a successful coming-of-age drama told through a woman's lens. In Malayalam cinema, Feminichi Fathima - with \"Feminichi\" a social-media distortion of \"feminist\" - used humour to follow a Muslim housewife's quiet rebellion against patriarchy. On the streaming side, The Great Shamsuddin Family has been praised for capturing the everyday resilience and complexities of modern Muslim women.\"It's a quieter movement, working from the margins,\" says Ms Choudhary. \"And it isn't going to disappear.\"",

    "body": "'Somewhere to put worker bees': Why Canada's micro-condos are losing their appeal1 day agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporterWatch: BBC reporter reacts to shockingly small $350K condo in TorontoMaggie Hildebrand's first apartment in Toronto had a kitchen, a dining table, a workspace and a bed – all in the same 300-sq-ft room.It was a decent home at first, close enough to her job downtown and with all the bare necessities for daily living.But it didn't take long for the 28-year-old to feel boxed-in. \"It was so isolating in that tiny space,\" she told the BBC. \"It definitely feels like it's just somewhere to put worker bees during the night.\"Ms Hildebrand lived in one of the city's micro-condos, a once rare sight in Canadian real estate that has become ubiquitous in the last decade thanks to fast-growing, high-rise developments in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver.But - as Canada's condominium market sinks to lows not seen in decades due to a series of market pressures - the value of these micro units is cratering faster than any others.The condo market is experiencing a downturn not seen since the 1980s, with thousands of move-in-ready units sitting empty and unsold across Toronto and its surrounding regions. Over the last year, an unprecedented 18 condo projects were cancelled in the city, with experts expecting that number will grow as demand continues to plummet.The downturn has reignited debate over whether developers catered too much to real estate investors by building smaller, more affordable units that minimised square footage to keep prices low in areas where land values are high, and which were often designed to be rented out or flipped for profit.Investors own the majority of condos under 600 sq ft in Toronto, according to national database Statistics Canada. Construction of these small units skyrocketed in 2016, and they now make up 38% of condos built in the city, compared with only 7.7% before.These units have not exploded in the same way in the US, where they represent a very small share of the market, though Nadia Evangelou, a senior economist at the National Association of Realtors, said \"their prevalence has roughly doubled over the past decade\".With so much inventory on the market in Canada, some micro-condos that had sold for half a million dollars a few years ago are now reselling for C$300,000 ($217,000; £163,000) or less – a price recently unthinkable in downtown Toronto, which is often cited as one of the most unaffordable cities in the world.\"It's a race to the bottom getting these things sold,\" said Shaun Hildebrand, president of Urbanation, an organisation that has been tracking the high-rise market in Toronto for decades. (Shaun Hildebrand is not related to Ms Hildebrand.)Why are so many condos sitting empty?The condo slump is not unique to Toronto, with Vancouver experiencing a similar –albeit smaller – downturn since 2024.There are a few reasons for this, experts tell the BBC.First is an overabundant supply. Thousands of units were  built over the last two years, in part to meet an unprecedented surge in Canada's population driven largely by immigration, Mr Hildebrand said.But the number of newcomers dropped sharply following a shift in Canada's immigration policies, made partly to address the housing crunch. A report released in December by the Bank of Montreal shows that Canada's population saw its largest decline in 2025 on record since the 1940s, barring the 2020 Covid pandemic, driven mainly by new immigration caps.It is a turn-around that developers could not have predicted, and resulted in more than 60,000 new units completed in recent years to meet a demand that no longer exists.Simply put, \"the market just got way too ahead of itself\", Mr Hildebrand said.The second reason is pricing.Canada's central bank lowered interest rates during the pandemic to stimulate the economy, and investors, looking to buy in a real estate market that had seemed like a sure bet for decades, assumed prices could only continue to rise.For a while they did, spiking \"to a level that really made no sense\", Mr Hildebrand said.Then, the Bank of Canada began to increase rates to battle post-pandemic inflation. Combined with oversupply, that sure bet became less certain.Now, some investors are having trouble closing on units they bought pre-construction at those inflated prices. Many have been forced to try and sell them at a significant loss. Others are too spooked to enter the market or are waiting for prices to drop even further, Mr Hildebrand said.There is some speculation that Canada's 2022 freeze on foreign home buyers, brought in to help tackle the housing affordability crisis, also played a role. Numbers show that they represent a small fraction of owners – around 2% to 6% – but Mr Hildebrand said it is possible it has sent a signal that Canada is closed for business.Watch: Maggie Hildebrand shares on TikTok what it's like to live in a micro condoThe condo crash and the housing marketOne clear winner from the downturn of the condo market is renters like Ms Hildebrand, who now have more options due to greater supply and slightly better deals on rent.Ms Hildebrand paid C$2,200 a month for her micro-condo. She has since moved to a larger, 700 square-foot, one-bedroom apartment in an older building with a leafy backyard for only C$200 more. She credits the move to a big improvement in her quality of life.\"My birthday is tomorrow, and I'm having a party and hosting 25 people,\" she told the BBC in December. \"A year ago, that was not possible.\"Mr Hildebrand said the slump will likely change who developers see as their main customer, shifting from short-term investors seeking quick profits towards longer-term investors and people who plan to settle in the condo they're buying,\"We've learned our lesson here,\" he said. The units won't be phased out altogether, he noted, because there is still demand for affordability, \"but we went way too far\".Some buyers are benefiting, too. Alex Cruz, a Toronto-based estate agent at Ari Zadegan Group Realty, told the BBC that smaller units were being purchased by those looking for a bargain.\"If there is a good deal per square foot, people will buy it,\" Mr Cruz said, adding it had given some \"an opportunity to get into the market\".The slump comes as Canada grapples with a housing crisis that has become a central political issue for all levels of government. Prime Minister Mark Carney has promised to double the rate of new homes built in the next decade.With the construction of thousands of units now put on hold or cancelled, there will be fewer units entering the market by the end of the decade. This could exacerbate Canada's housing crunch, Mr Hildebrand said, as condos are heavily relied on to boost supply in big cities.And Mr Hildebrand and others warn that the low prices will be short-lived.\"The question now is how long do we stay here, and what are the implications going to be for the housing supply in the next decade?\" Mr Hildebrand said.",

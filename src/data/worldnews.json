    "description": "Jeffrey Epstein appears to have confirmed that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was photographed with Virginia Giuffre, according to a newly released email.",
    "body": "Jeffrey Epstein appears to have confirmed that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was photographed with Virginia Giuffre, according to a newly released email.The message sent by Epstein - who is alleged to have taken the photo - reads: \"Yes she [Giuffre] was on my plane and yes she had her picture taken with Andrew.\"Epstein's account appears to contradict the former prince's assertion that he never met Ms Giuffre and his longstanding suggestion that the image of him with his arm around her may have been doctored.The July 2011 email was published on Wednesday alongside more than 20,000 pages of correspondence from the convicted sex offender and disgraced financier's estate.Ms Giuffre - a prominent accuser of Epstein - alleged Andrew had sex with her three times as a teenager. Andrew, who has denied the allegations, reached an out-of-court settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022. It contained no admission of liability or apology.The email from Epstein to his publicist Peggy Siegal was sent shortly after Ms Giuffre was identified publicly in the Mail on Sunday.The newspaper also printed the photo of her with Andrew and Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.In a 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight, Andrew denied meeting Ms Giuffre and suggested that the photograph - or elements of it - may have been faked. Andrew said at the time: \"Nobody can prove whether or not that photograph has been doctored but I don't recollect that photograph ever being taken.\"The documents - published by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee - also suggest that Andrew and Epstein remained in contact four months after the prince claimed their relationship had ended.On 4 March 2011, Maxwell appears to have forwarded a right-of-reply email from the Mail on Sunday to Epstein. It outlines a series of allegations, including that Andrew had sex with a young woman introduced to him at Maxwell's London home in 2001.The message appears to have then been forwarded by Epstein to Andrew, via redacted email address marked \"The Duke\".Andrew's reply reads: \"Please make sure that every statement or legal letter states clearly that I am NOT involved and that I knew and know NOTHING about any of these allegations. I can't take any more of this my end.\"The Mail on Sunday went on to publish its story alongside the photograph. It included allegations that girls were directed to sit on Andrew's knee at Epstein's New York home, that he groped them and took part in sexual encounters on Epstein's private island. The documents also reveal attempts by Epstein to discredit Ms Giuffre's testimony.In the July 2011 email to his publicist, Epstein also wrote: \"The girl who accused Prince Andrew can also easily be proven to be a liar. I think Buckingham Palace would love it. \"You should task someone to investigate the girl Virginia Roberts, that has caused the Queen's son all this agro [sic].\"The latest release comes after Andrew was requested by Democrats in the US Congress to answer questions as part of its investigation into Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking offences.A Democrat on the House Oversight Committee - Congressman Suhas Subramanyam - told BBC Newsnight that Andrew had not yet responded to the Committee's invitation to testify before the committee. He said the former prince \"doesn't have to get on a plane to testify, he can do it remotely\". Andrew was stripped of all his titles earlier this month after Ms Giuffre's posthumous memoir renewed interest in his ties to Epstein and Maxwell.",

    "body": "Three people have died and at least 26 others injured in a wave of Russian drone and missile strikes on Kyiv, Ukrainian officials say.Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko described strikes, which caused explosions and fires in residential buildings across the city, as \"massive\". Kyiv's energy infrastructure was also damaged, leaving some buildings in the north-east without heat, he said. Ukraine's air force reported several other regions across the country were also being targeted.Russia's defence ministry said it had downed or intercepted 216 Ukrainian drones that had targeted its industrial facilities and disrupted air travel, according to Reuters news agency. In Kyiv, residential buildings came under attack \"in practically every district\", the head of the city's military administration Tymur Tkachenko said on Telegram.He issued a warning to take shelter a minute after midnight local time on Friday (22:01 GMT), writing \"it's loud in Kyiv\".Falling debris and fires have damaged multiple high-rise apartment buildings, a hospital, school and administrative buildings, according to emergency services. More than 40 people have been rescued, they added, including 14 from a fire in a residential building in Desnayanskyi district where one person died.Another person was rescued in the building after being pulled from beneath rubble, they said.Medical teams were deployed to all fires, officials said, while Klitschko said nine people were being treated in hospital with one man in an \"extremely serious condition\".Parts of the Ukrainian capital's heating network were also damaged in the attack, the mayor noted, adding that the city's electricity and water supplies may have been disrupted. Ukraine's air force warned drones and guided bombs had been targeting several other regions, including Sumy.The overnight strikes follow the deaths of six people in another Russian offensive less than a week ago that also damaged residential buildings and energy infrastructure. Russia says its attacks on energy targets, now a familiar part of the war, are aimed at the Ukrainian military. Those attacks prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to call for \"no exceptions\" to Western sanctions on Russian energy - shortly after the US granted Hungary one such exemption. US President Donald Trump had initially announced the sanctions on Russian oil after saying ceasefire talks with Russian President Vladimir were not progressing. ",

    "body": "Israel has identified the hostage body returned by Hamas on Thursday as that of Meny Godard, who was 73 when he was killed in the 7 October attacks. Red Cross vehicles collected his body hours after Hamas issued a joint statement with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad saying it had been located in the Khan Younis area of southern Gaza.The Israeli prime minister's office said forensic testing confirmed the body belonged to Godard, who was killed along with his wife, Ayelet, during Hamas's raid on kibbutz Be'eri on 7 October 2023.Three out of 28 deceased hostages remain in Gaza, with the first phase of the current ceasefire deal which forms part of a US plan to end the Gaza war.Under the ceasefire deal, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was still holding.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.For each dead Israeli hostage returned, Israel has agreed to hand over the remains of 15 Palestinians. But with no DNA testing available in Gaza, it is hard to identify them.Hamas seized 251 hostages when it launched the deadly attack in southern Israel on 7 October 2023 during which it killed 1,200 people. More than 69,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's retaliatory response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, whose figures the UN considers reliable.Of the three bodies still in Gaza, two are Israeli and one is Thai.Israel has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the hostages' bodies, but Hamas has said it is struggling to find them under rubble.The slow progress has meant there has been no advance on the second phase of US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan. This includes plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas, and reconstruction of the Gaza Strip.",

    "body": "16 hours agoNichola Mandil,Juba and Basillioh RukangaSouth Sudan's leader Salva Kiir has in a shock move dismissed one of his vice-presidents, Benjamin Bol Mel, who had been tipped as his possible successor.Kiir stripped Bol Mel of his military rank of general and dismissed him from the national security service. He also sacked the central bank governor and the head of the revenue authority, both considered close allies of Bol Mel.No explanation was given for the dismissals, which were announced in a decree broadcast on state television.It comes when there are growing fears of political instability and a possible return to civil war, after the recent collapse of a fragile power-sharing agreement between Kiir and opposition leader Riek Machar.Bol Mel, 47, showed no animosity in his response to the sacking.\"I extend my deepest gratitude to you for granting me the privilege to serve the people of South Sudan as vice president,\" he wrote in a letter to Kiir.\"I have full confidence that South Sudan and the SPLM [governing party] will continue to rise under your stewardship.\"Bol Mel was only appointed vice-president in February, replacing James Wani Igga, a veteran politician and general. He was also elevated to become the first deputy chairman of the SPLM, which analysts believe gave him more powers and positioned him as a potential successor to the 74-year-old Kiir. The president later promoted him to the full rank of a general in the National Security Service (NSS).Bol Mel's promotion came despite the US placing sanctions against him for alleged corruption in 2017, which were renewed earlier this year. The US Treasury described Bol Mel as Kiir's \"principal financial advisor\". Kiir's office denied the description.Bol Mel has never directly responded to the corruption accusations against him.The president has not announced replacements in any of the positions he held.His dismissal follows speculation on social media about an internal power struggle in the SPLM.A senior government official, who preferred to remain anonymous for safety reasons, told the BBC that Bol Mel had been a \"divisive figure\" in government. \"It's good that he has gone,\" he said.A taxi driver in the capital, Juba, also welcomed the dismissal.\"Everybody hates this man. Even in his home town of Aweil people celebrated his dismissal. We are happy for President Kiir,\" he told the BBC.Hours before Bol Mel's sacking, his security detail was reportedly withdrawn from his residence and office in the capital, Juba.South Sudan is an oil-rich nation that became the world's newest country in 2011 after seceding from Sudan. It was engulfed by civil war two years later, after Kiir and Machar fell out.The 2018 power-sharing agreement that ended the war has been fraught with challenges, as tensions persist and sporadic violence continues to erupt.Planned elections have been postponed twice in the past three years and fighting between forces loyal to the president and armed groups has recently escalated.Machar was sacked as vice-president and arrested earlier this year and in September charged with murder, treason and crimes against humanity in a move seen as aggravating tensions and sparking fears of renewed civil unrest. The case is ongoing.His spokesperson described the charges against him as a \"political witch-hunt\".The charges followed an attack by a militia allegedly linked to Machar, which the government said had killed 250 soldiers and a general.",

    "body": "Drugs disguised as tea keep washing up on this S Korean holiday island1 day agoKelly NgJeju Coast GuardSome 28kg of ketamine, wrapped in foil and labelled with the Chinese character for tea, have been found in the last two monthsSince September, residents on South Korea's Jeju island have been spotting small packs of what appear to be bags of Chinese tea washed ashore. Upon closer inspection, however, they were found to contain ketamine.Some 28kg (62 lbs) of the drug, wrapped in foil and labelled with the Chinese character for tea, have been found on at least eight occasions, police say.Ketamine is used as an anaesthetic in medical procedures, but its recreational use is illegal in South Korea. It can cause severe physical and mental damage, including to the heart and lungs, when misused.The Jeju Coast Guard has formed a team to trace possible sea and land routes through which the drugs may have entered the country.Authorities have also warned residents not to touch or open any suspicious objects found along the shore, asking them to instead report such discoveries to police.On 15 October, a beach cleaner found 20kg of these \"tea bag drugs\" - the largest haul in the last two months - along the coast of Seogwipo in southern Jeju.Earlier this week, a team of more than 800 soldiers, police officers and civilian volunteers was deployed to comb the beaches in Jeju City, along the holiday island's northern coast, Korea JoongAng Daily reported. Investigators are now focusing on the possibility that the drugs drifted to Jeju via ocean currents, according to the national daily.It quoted the head of the Coast Guard's narcotics unit saying that similar discoveries of \"tea bag drugs\" have been made in Pohang, another city in South Korea, and Tsushima island in Japan. News1A team of more than 800 soldiers, police officiers and civilian volunteers was deployed to comb through the beaches in Jeju CityJeju residents have shown concern over the presence of illicit drugs on their coastlines. \"I often bring my children to this beach,\" said Kim, a resident who witnessed the large-scale search effort in Jeju City this week.\"Seeing so many people looking for drugs is terrifying. I shudder to think that children might touch something like that,\" Kim told Korea JoongAng Daily.Another resident, Hyun, wants authorities to focus on \"stopping more [drugs] from drifting in\".Yoon Heung-hee, a professor at Hansung University's drug and alcohol addiction department, suggests a larger syndicate may be behind the ketamine packets. Some syndicates use a \"sea bump\" method to transport narcotics, he said, which involves dropping bundles of drugs equipped with trackers into the ocean for retrieval later.Criminal groups could have sought to smuggle the drugs across South Korea via Jeju by \"taking advantage of lax inspections at airports and ports\", Prof Yoon told The Hankyoreh, another local newspaper.Additional reporting by Suhnwook Lee in Seoul",

    "body": "1 day agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesSkims, the shapewear brand co-founded by celebrity and entrepreneur Kim Kardashian, says it is now valued at $5bn (£2.93bn) after raising $225m of new funding.The company says it plans to use the money from investors, including an arm of Wall Street banking giant Goldman Sachs, to open more shops and expand around the world.\"We can't wait to take Skims to the next level as we continue to innovate and set the standard for our industry,\" Kardashian said on Wednesday.The funding round is one of the biggest this year for a US consumer brand and comes as Skims faces fierce competition from rivals like Lululemon.Skims, which runs 18 shops in the US and sells its products through retailers worldwide, will focus \"predominantly\" on its physical retail business over the next few years, it said in a statement.The company expects its sales to top $1bn this year, which Skims chief executive Jens Grede said gave the firm the confidence to pursue its long-term goals.The brand debuted in 2019 with a line of shapewear and has since broadened its range to include loungewear and other fashion categories.Getty ImagesSkims will focus \"predominantly\" on its physical retail businessThe company's growth has moved it deeper into the mainstream sports and athleisure market, which is largely dominated by brands like Lululemon and Alo Yoga.Skims has also amassed a large pool of influencers, including the Kardashians and other celebrities like Megan Fox and Paris Hilton to boost its appeal.Since its launch the company has faced some controversies. Its initial name, Kimono Intimates, was criticised for disregarding the significance of the traditional Japanese outfit, prompting the company to come up with another name - Skims.One Skims product - a head wrap worn during sleep - split the internet. Some hailed it as the future of non-invasive face contouring, but others condemned it as dystopian, and said the firm was making women feel more insecure.",

    "body": "The Nigerian government has announced it is cancelling a controversial policy that mandated the use of indigenous languages for teaching in the earliest years of schooling instead of English.Education Minister Tunji Alausa said the programme, introduced just three years ago, had failed to deliver and was being scrapped with immediate effect.Instead, English will be reinstated as the medium of instruction from pre-primary levels through to university.The now-defunct programme was launched by former Education Minister Adamu Adamu, who had argued that children learnt more effectively in their mother tongue.At the time, Adamu argued that pupils grasped concepts more readily when taught in \"their own mother tongue\" - a view supported by numerous UN studies on early childhood education.Nigeria's education system is facing serious problems, such as poor-quality teaching, inadequate materials, low pay for teachers and numerous strikes.Although 85% of children go to primary school, less than half complete their secondary education.Some 10 million children are out of school in Nigeria, more than in any other country, according to the UN.Announcing the reversal of the language policy in the capital, Abuja, Dr Alausa pointed to poor academic results from those areas which had adopted mother-tongue teaching.He cited data from the West African Examinations Council (WAEC), the National Examinations Council (Neco), and the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (Jamb).\"We have seen a mass failure rate in WAEC, Neco, and Jamb in certain geo-political zones of the country, and those are the ones that adopted this mother tongue in an over-subscribed manner,\" the minister stated.The abrupt cancellation of the policy has drawn a mixed response from education specialists, analysts and parents.Some have hailed the government's decision, agreeing that the implementation was problematic and contributed to falling standards.Others, however, believe the policy was abandoned prematurely. They argue that such a significant shift requires substantial investment in teacher training, the development of textbooks and learning materials, and a longer timeframe before it can be fairly judged and begin to bear fruit.Education expert Dr Aliyu Tilde praised the reversal, saying Nigeria isn't ready for such a move.\"Does Nigeria have trained teachers to teach in the dozens of indigenous languages in the country? The answer is no. Also the major exams like WAEC, Jamb are all in English and not in those mother tongue languages.\"I think what's needed to improve the quality of our schools is bringing in qualified teachers,” he told the BBC.A mother who has two children in early education schools, Hajara Musa, said she supported the reversal as it would help young children to learn English at an early age.\"English is a global language that is used everywhere and I feel it's better these kids start using it from the start of their schooling instead of waiting for when they are older,” she told the BBC.However, social affairs analyst Habu Dauda disagreed.“I think it was scrapped prematurely instead of giving it more time. Three years is too little to judge a big shift such as this - the government ought to have added more investment,\" he said.The debate highlights the ongoing challenge in Nigeria of balancing the promotion of its rich linguistic heritage with the practical demands of a national curriculum and a globalised economy where English proficiency is dominant.",

    "body": "21 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterValve, the company behind PC gaming platform Steam, has revealed a new console to rival Nintendo, Xbox and PlayStation.The Steam Machine is a home console designed to allow gamers to play PC games on their TV - though it can also be used as a computer.It is a spiritual sequel to the 2014 device of the same name, which failed to break into a market dominated by the three big gaming giants.Prices for those consoles, back then, started at $499 (£300) - but Valve's latest iteration is expected to cost a good deal more.The Steam Machine will go on sale in early 2026, the company said, with the pricing yet to be announced.The company says this and more details will be provided closer to the exact release date, which is also currently unknown.Since Valve launched Steam in 2003, it has grown to become the world's largest distribution platform for PC gaming.Around 25 million Steam players were online and six million were playing games at the time of writing, according to the platform's own metrics.But whether its new hardware can match Steam's success will remain to be seen when the devices launch next year.Analysts previously cast doubt on the Steam Machine's significance when it launched in its original, clunkier form a decade ago - saying its price-tag and potential might only really entice Steam \"power users\".In a video announcement, Valve described the new console as \"a powerful gaming PC in a small but mighty package\".The firm argues the device is \"optimised for gaming\" over other PCs because the firm is able to say which games on its massive digital storefront will work on it before you buy.Powered by its Linux-based SteamOS operating system and AMD graphics processors, Valve said the new Steam Machine can support 4k resolution and 60 frames per second.But industry expert Christopher Dring said its potential and appeal may be limited, comparing it to the firm's handheld Steam Deck console which has a \"lucrative but niche\" audience of \"around four to five million players\".\"Most of those people were already Steam customers looking to take their PC games on-the-go,\" he said.\"My feeling is the Steam Machine will be similar - this will mostly appeal to a lucrative enthusiast audience of existing Steam players who want to play their games in a living room setting.\".In an unusual move, Valve has also announced further hardware - its Steam Frame virtual reality (VR) headset.The device is entirely wireless - and it described it as a \"streaming-first\" device - but it is also itself a PC running SteamOS.And it also claims to be bringing a technical leap forward in the VR space, with the headset displaying highest-quality graphics only in the bits of the screen a user is looks at.With the sweeping new device announcements, Valve hopes to rival its more established competitors.In recent years, Microsoft-owned Xbox has placed its subscription service Game Pass at the heart of its offering for gamers - some say at the expense of its console crown.Meanwhile the PS5 has been the best-selling console for some time, but fans have been left asking when its successor will appear on the market.Brandon Sutton, games industry analyst at Midia research, said the announcements showed Valve's \"strong grasp of where the gaming market is headed and what gamers want\".\"With Sony and Microsoft moving away from console exclusives, and the prevalence of games streaming services, it has never been a better time for a PC-Console hybrid,\" he told the BBC.",

    "body": "10 hours agoJessica ParkerBerlin correspondentGermany's coalition government has agreed a new military service plan to boost troop numbers following months of wrangling between political forces.The new military service plan will mandate all 18-year-old men to fill out a questionnaire on their suitability to serve and, from 2027, to undergo medical screening.The decision comes as Berlin aims to create Europe's strongest conventional army.The boss of Germany's biggest defence firm, Rheinmetall, has told the BBC he believes that target could be met in five years.Lawmakers are expected to vote on the plan by the end of 2025. Armin Papperger said Chancellor Friedrich Merz's aim to boost the Bundeswehr was \"realistic\" and he told the BBC that \"clear decisions\" were coming from government.Earlier this year German defence chief Gen Carsten Breuer warned that the Western Nato alliance had to prepare for a possible Russian attack within four years.Mr Papperger said he had \"no glass ball\" about the future but agreed Germany had to be \"ready in '29\".When they formed a coalition earlier this year, Merz's conservative CDU/CSU and the centre-left Social Democrat SPD agreed to re-introduce military service which would be voluntary \"to start with\".The Bundeswehr currently has around 182,000 troops. The new military service model aims to increase that number by 20,000 over the next year, rising to between 255,000 and 260,000 over the next 10 years, supplemented by approximately 200,000 reservists.From next year, all 18-year-old men and women will be sent a questionnaire to assess their interest and willingness to join the armed forces. It will be mandatory for men and voluntary for women.From July 2027 all men aged 18 will also have to take a medical exam to assess their fitness for duty.If the government's targets are not met, a form of compulsory enlistment could be considered by parliament. If war were to break out, the military would be able to draw on the questionnaires and medical exams for potential recruits.Some within Germany's political left remain deeply opposed to mandatory service.Many young Germans are wary and a significant majority oppose it. A recent Forsa survey for Stern magazine suggested while just over half of respondents favoured compulsory service, opposition rose to 63% among 18- to 29-year-olds.\"I don't want to go to war because I don't want to die or I don't want to be shot at,\" said Jimi, a 17-year-old student from Berlin, who attended an anti-conscription protest outside the Bundestag earlier this week. \"I also don't want to shoot people.\"An attack against Germany was an \"unlikely and abstract scenario\" that the government was using to legitimise \"stealing millions of young people's right to decide what they should be doing\", he said.Meanwhile, 21-year-old Jason signed up as new Bundeswehr recruit earlier this year because of the current \"security situation\".\"I wanted to contribute to defend peace, to defend democracy if the worst happens,\" he said. By joining up he felt he was \"giving back to society\" but also believed in the deterrent potential of the army, \"so potential enemies don't even think about attacking you\".Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has sought to reassure Germans, saying that despite the new military service plan there was \"no cause for concern... no reason for fear\".\"The more capable of deterrence and defence our armed forces are, through armament through training and through personnel, the less likely it is that we will become a party to a conflict at all,\" Pistorius said.Defence spending in Germany tumbled after the end of the Cold War, while conscription was suspended in 2011.Given its past, Germany has long been shy of showing military might, but earlier this year Friedrich Merz announced that the rule for German defence \"now has to be whatever it takes\", following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Nato countries across Europe have come under pressure from President Donald Trump's White House to hike spending.European moves to re-arm have meant significant revenue for Rheinmetall. Its CEO, Armin Papperger, whose firm also supplies Ukraine, said: \"We make a lot of money because there is a huge demand.\"\"We have to grow strong on vehicles, on ammunition, we have to have our own satellite competencies. We do much more on the electronics and artificial intelligence... than ever before,\" he said.A US report last year suggested the Rheinmetall boss had been the target of a Russian assassination plot. There was no confirmation at the time and Mr Papperger would not be drawn on the report, saying: \"I feel good, I feel safe.\"Asked about whether he felt Europe was in a state of a cold or hybrid war, he said: \"Whatever you call it, it's not a peaceful time.\"",

    "body": "1 day agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorAlmost a year to the day since French-Algerian writer Boualem Sansal was arrested on arrival at Algiers airport, the Algerian president has pardoned him and allowed him to leave the country.Sansal, 81, has been at the centre of a bitter diplomatic row between Paris and Algiers and President Abdelmadjid Tebboune's decision came in response to a direct approach from German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.The writer arrived in Germany on a military plane on Wednesday evening and was taken to hospital.French President Emmanuel Macron, who spoke to Sansal by phone, said France had used respect and calm to bring about his freedom.\"I thank President Tebboune for this act of humanity,\" said Macron.Although Paris had for months sought to lower tensions with Algeria, it was the German president's role that secured Sansal's release because of his good relations with Algeria's leader.French ambassador Stéphane Romatet, who was recalled from Algiers earlier this year for consultations because of the row, told French radio on Thursday that the crisis in relations was so deep that \"from the start we knew a happy outcome... would go through a trusted third party and the German solution quickly came forward\".Steinmeier said this week he had asked President Tebboune to pardon Sansal, \"given his advanced age and fragile health\", so the writer could receive medical treatment in Germany.Tebboune said on Wednesday he had decided to respond favourably to Steinmeier's request \"because of its nature and humanitarian motives\". Sansal is being treated for prostate cancer.He was given a five-year jail sentence in July for undermining national unity with remarks that questioned Algeria's borders.The novelist has long been a critic of Algeria's government, which had not responded favourably to France's appeal for clemency.Relations had already been on the slide after President Macron announced France was recognising Moroccan sovereignty of Western Sahara and backed a plan for limited autonomy for the disputed territory.Algeria backs the pro-independence Polisario Front in Western Sahara and is seen as its main ally.The spat worsened in April when Algeria expressed outrage after one of its consular staff in France was arrested over the kidnapping of a government critic in Paris.The crisis between the two countries was seen as unprecedented in more than 60 years since Algeria secured independence from France in 1962.Some French commentators and political figures blamed what was seen as a confrontational stance to Algeria taken by right-wing former Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau and others on the right of French politics.Algerian minister Sofiane Chaib also blamed Retailleau earlier this year for the \"fabricated spat\".Then at the end of last month a motion by France's National Rally was narrowly passed by MPs opposing a 1968 Franco-Algerian migration accord that granted residency rights to Algerians.Although the move was seen as a potential setback, the decision to replace Retailleau with Laurent Nuñez as interior minister appeared to signal a new mood.\"He has completely changed the way relations with [Algeria] are handled\", ex-diplomat Jean-Christophe Ruffin told French radio.Retailleau responded to Sansal's release on Wednesday speaking of \"immense relief and great joy\".Tensions between the two countries remain, though, after French sportswriter Christophe Gleizes was jailed for seven years in July for allegedly trying to interview a member of a movement designed by Algeria as a terrorist group.French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot praised diplomats for their work in securing Sansal's release, and said they remained focused on Gleizes, \"whose imminent release we are hoping for\".",

    "body": "10 hours agoImogen FoulkesIn BernAPTrump was pictured on Monday apparently with the Swiss gifts on his desk in the Oval OfficeSwiss ministers are in Washington for talks aimed at slashing US President Donald Trump's steep 39% tariffs on Switzerland's exports to the US – the highest rate in Europe.Initial attempts by Swiss President Karin Keller Sutter to change Trump's mind fell on deaf ears. But a visit on 4 November by business leaders appears to have changed his mind.A senior administration official told reporters on Thursday that the talks between the US and the Swiss ministers were \"very positive\" and \"very focused\", adding that they are \"very aware\" of their trade deficit with the US and are prepared to address it.For months the Swiss have been trying to bring down the rate, which has hit Switzerland hard.Trump's response to the Swiss president's bid was that she \"was a nice woman, but she did not want to listen\".But last week's private business initiative adopted a more unconventional approach.Swiss industry chiefs came to the Oval Office on 4 November bearing gifts,  including a Rolex gold watch and a specially engraved gold bar from Swiss-based gold refining company MKS.Already this week Trump has said a deal is being worked on to bring the tariffs \"a little bit lower… I haven't set any number\".After their talks the Swiss industrialists said in a statement \"our entire initiative was undertaken in the spirit of Swiss unity between the private and public sectors\".Some business figures, particularly those trading in luxury goods, gold, or commodities, already had contacts in Trump's circle.In September, Trump appeared at the US Open tennis final in the Rolex VIP box hosted by the Swiss watch company's chief executive Jean Frédéric Dufour. MANDEL NGAN/AFPJean Frédéric Dufour and Trump stood together in the Rolex VIP box in New York in SeptemberThe president, apparently guessing what was going on, even asked if Dufour would have been there if Trump had not slapped such steep tariffs on Switzerland.Last week Dufour met Trump again, this time in the Oval Office, along with fellow business leaders including Johann Rupert from luxury goods maker Richemont and Marwan Shakarchi from MKS.It is quite normal nowadays for any leader heading to the Oval Office to come bearing a gift.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer brought an invitation from King Charles for a lavish state visit. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz offered a framed copy of Trump's German grandfather's birth certificate.Requests for confirmation of the gifts to the two Swiss companies involved brought a \"no comment\" from Rolex and MKS.But days after the meeting, Trump was pictured in the Oval Office with what looked very much like a Rolex \"Datejust\" desk clock, produced by the company as a collector's item, and worth tens of thousands of dollars.BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFPThe Rolex desk clock was pictured on Trump's desk on MondayA White House official confirmed the two items had been given to Trump.The US president receives thousands of gifts every year and they then become US property, deposited with the National Archives and filed annually by the state department. They are eventually transferred to a presidential library. Some gifts can be kept but presidents have to pay federal taxes if they do not come from a close relative.In 1969, President Richard Nixon gently refused the gift of a Swiss Omega watch to commemorate the Moon landings.Whatever happens to the Swiss gifts, Trump's stance towards the Swiss appears to be softening, telling reporters he is working on something \"to help Switzerland\".Swiss economy minister Guy Parmelin and chief trade negotiator Helene Budliger Artieda, who travelled to Washington on Wednesday, are more hopeful than they have been in months, amid suggestions that 39% tariff may be reduced to 15% - the same as Switzerland's neighbours in the EU.In return, promises from the Swiss pharmaceutical giants to build more production plants in the US are already on the table. It is also reported that Swiss International Airlines, whose fleet is primarily Airbus, may pivot towards Boeing.But will it be enough? Swiss industry is waiting with bated breath. The tariffs are beginning to bite, with a number of Swiss companies warning they will have to furlough staff if nothing changes.The Swiss do have one more highly influential figure they can call on.Fifa president and Swiss citizen Gianni Infantino, long a friend of Trump's, was reportedly urged by some Swiss parliamentarians to try to change the president's mind.As part of preparations for next year's World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico, Infantino visited the Oval Office in August bearing the trophy.As the cameras rolled he handed it to Trump saying he was \"a winner\". The president responded asking \"can I keep it? That's a beautiful piece of gold\".Infantino has also announced a brand new Fifa world peace prize, to be announced in Washington DC on 5 December.All bets are off as to who that might be.",

    "body": "Some 200 Kenyans are fighting for Russia in its war against Ukraine and more could be recruited into the conflict, authorities say. Among them are former members of Kenya's security forces, according to Kenya's Foreign Affairs Minister Musalia Mudavadi. Some of those who have been rescued said they were forced to assemble drones and handle chemicals without proper training or protective gear, the minister added.Kenyan President William Ruto last week requested the Ukrainian government to secure the release of Kenyans currently held in the conflict zone.About 1,400 citizens from across Africa are fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, with some recruited through deception, the Ukraine government said last week. A young Kenyan athlete was in September captured in Ukraine and said that he had been tricked into joining the Russian army.\"Recruitment exercises in Russia have reportedly expanded to include African nationals, including Kenyans,\" said Mudavadi in a press conference on Wednesday. \"Over 200 Kenyans may have joined the Russian military... recruitment networks are still active in both Kenya and Russia,\" he added. Kenya's embassy in Moscow has recorded injuries among some of the recruits, who were allegedly promised up to $18,000 (£14,000) to cover costs for visas, travel, and accommodation, the minister said. Mudavadi also said the Kenyan government had concerns about the increasing number of nationals who have been recruited into \"forced criminality\" such as drug trafficking and forced labour in foreign countries. \"These crimes present a serious threat to not only the national security of Kenya but to global security as well.\" In September, Kenyan authorities rescued more than 20 nationals who were preparing to join the Russia-Ukraine war near the capital, Nairobi. One person suspected of coordinating the recruitment of Kenyans to Russia was arrested and is facing prosecution in connection with the scheme.  The BBC has found evidence to suggest the Kremlin is working to expand its sphere of influence in Africa.South Africa recently launched an investigation into how 17 of its citizens ended up in the war-torn region of Donbas in eastern Ukraine.Citizens of Somalia, Sierra Leone, Togo, Cuba and Sri Lanka , among others, are currently being held in Ukrainian prisoner-of-war camps, Petro Yatsenko, Ukraine's spokesperson on the treatment of prisoners of war, recently told the BBC.Ukraine has also previously come in for criticism for trying to recruit foreign nationals, including Africans, to fight on its side.",

    "body": "Jeremy Bowen: Syria feels lighter without the Assads' crushing weight - but now there are new problems22 hours agoJeremy BowenInternational EditorBBCA year ago, the war that President Bashar al-Assad seemed to have won was turned upside down.A rebel force had broken out of Idlib, a Syrian province on the border with Turkey, and was storming towards Damascus. It was led by a man known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, and his militia group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Jolani was a nom-de-guerre, reflecting his family's roots in the Golan Heights, Syria's southern highlands, annexed by Israel after it was occupied in 1967. His real name is Ahmed al-Sharaa.One year later, he is interim president, and Bashar al-Assad is in a gilded exile in Russia. Syria is still in ruins. In every city and village I have visited this last 10 days, people were living in skeletal buildings gutted by war. But for all the new Syria's problems, it feels much lighter without the crushing, cruel weight of the Assads.Getty ImagesSyria is still in ruins. In cities and villages, many people are living in skeletal buildings gutted by warSharaa has found the going easier abroad than at home. He has won the argument with Saudi Arabia and the West that he is Syria's best chance of a stable future.In May, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia arranged a brief meeting between Sharaa and US President Donald Trump. Afterwards, Trump called him a \"young attractive tough guy\".At home, Syrians know his weaknesses and the problems Syria faces better than foreigners. Sharaa's writ does not run in the north-east, where the Kurds are in control, or parts of the south where Syrian Druze, another minority sect, want a separate state backed by their Israeli allies. On the coast Alawites – Assad's sect – fear a repeat of the massacres they suffered in March.AFP via Getty ImagesTrump called him a 'young attractive tough guy'A year ago, the new masters of Damascus, like most of the armed rebels in Syria, were Sunni Islamists. Sharaa, their leader, had a long history fighting for al-Qaeda in Iraq, where he had been imprisoned by the Americans, and then was a senior commander with the group that became Islamic State.Later, as he built his power base in Syria, he broke with and fought both IS and al-Qaeda. People who had travelled to Idlib to see him said that he had developed a much more pragmatic set of beliefs, better suited to governing Syria, with its spectrum of religious sects. Sunnis are the majority. As well as Kurds and Druze, there are Christians, many of whom find it hard to forget Sharaa's jihadist past.Image of a man who outgrew his jihadist rootsIn the first week of December last year, it was hard to believe that the HTS offensive was moving so fast. It took them three days to capture Aleppo, Syria's northern powerhouse.Compare that with the tortured years between 2012 and 2016, when the regime's army and rebel militias had fought for control of the city: that had ended in victory for Assad after Russia's president Vladimir Putin deployed his air force and artillery to add decisive firepower to the regime's ruthless tactics.When I visited the former rebel strongholds in eastern Aleppo a few weeks after they had fallen to the regime, large areas were devastated by Russian bombing. Some streets were blocked by rubble that went up to first-floor balconies.But by the end of 2024, across the country, government troops had melted away. Both reluctant conscripts and regime loyalists were no longer prepared to fight and die for a corrupt and cruel regime that repaid them with poverty and oppression.AFP via Getty ImagesOne year ago - celebrations marking the dawn of a new era for SyriaA few days after Assad fled with his family to Russia, I interviewed Syria's victorious new leader in the presidential palace.It perches high on a crag overlooking Damascus, designed as an ever-visible reminder for the city's citizens of the all-seeing power of the Assads. By then Jolani had discarded his name, along with his combat fatigues.Sharaa sat down in the chilly halls of the unheated palace wearing a smart jacket, pressed trousers and shiny black shoes. He told me that the country was exhausted by war and was not a threat to its neighbours or to the West, insisting that they would govern for all Syrians. It was a message that many Syrians and foreign governments wanted to hear.Israel dismissed it, however. And jihadist hardliners branded Sharaa as a traitor, selling out his religion and his own history.Watch: BBC speaks to Syrian rebel leader Ahmed al-SharaaI had packed in a hurry to report on a war, never expecting the regime to crumble so fast. My formal attire was back at home in London. After the interview one of his aides complained that I should have worn a suit to interview a national leader.His grumble was about more than my sartorial choices. It was the continuation of a long campaign that had started years earlier as Sharaa built up his power in Idlib. The campaign was designed to present him as a man who had outgrown his jihadist roots to become a worthy leader of all Syria, a leader the rest of the world should take seriously and treat with respect.A weakened IS in SyriaSharaa took power amid huge uncertainty about what he might do, and what might be done to him by his enemies. Among them were dark fears that jihadist extremists of the Islamic State, still existing in sleeper cells, could try to kill him, or cause chaos with mass casualty attacks in Damascus.Jihadists rage on social media about Sharaa's charm offensive in the west. After he agreed to join the US-led coalition against Islamic State, prominent voices online branded him an apostate, a Muslim who had turned on his own religion. Extremists could take that as a licence to kill.The reality is that IS in Syria is weak. Its attacks this year have been mostly against Kurdish-led forces in the north-east.That has changed in the last few weeks, leading up to the anniversary of the fall of the Assad regime.Getty ImagesThe war that President Bashar al-Assad seemed to have won was turned upside down one year agoAs security forces have raided IS cells, the jihadists have killed three soldiers and two former Assad operatives in cities controlled by the government, according to data collected by Charles Lister, a leading commentator on Syria, and published in a newsletter Syria Weekly. IS social media channels monitored by the BBC continue to tell Syrian Sunnis that Sharaa has betrayed them.Without producing any proof, they have posted claims that he has been an agent of the US and UK, working to undermine the jihadist project.Winning over Trump and the westSharaa's overtures to the west have been remarkably successful.Within two weeks of taking power in Syria, he received a delegation of senior American diplomats. Immediately, the Americans scrapped the $10 million bounty the they had put on his arrest.Since then, sanctions imposed on Assad's Syria have been steadily reduced. The most swingeing, the Caesar Act, has been suspended and could be repealed by the US Congress in the new year.A major milestone came in November when Sharaa became the first Syrian president to visit the White House.APTrump sprayed Sharaa with cologne, before presenting him with his own supply to take homeTrump's welcome in the Oval Office was relaxed. He sprayed Sharaa with Trump-branded cologne, before presenting him with his own supply to take home for his wife, jokingly asking him how many he has. \"One,\" Sharaa answered, as he blinked away clouds of fragrance.Away from the larking around for the cameras, Saudi Arabia as well as western governments see Sharaa as the best bet – the only one – to stabilise a country that sits at the heart of the Middle East. If Syria slipped back into civil war, there would be zero chance of reducing the violent turbulence in the region.One senior western diplomat told me that the conditions for civil war still exist. That is because of the lasting scars of half a century of dictatorship and 14 years of a war that started as an uprising against the Assads' oppressive rule and turned into an increasingly sectarian fight.AFP via Getty ImagesMany western governments see Sharaa as the best bet to stabilise Syria. His minister for foreign affairs, Assad al-Shaibani is front rightSharaa is a Sunni Muslim, Syria's largest religious group. His government does not control the whole country. In the last year he has not been able to persuade, or force, Kurds in the north-east and Druze in the south to accept the authority of Damascus. On the coast, the Alawite community is nervous and restive.The Alawites are a sect that originated in Shia Islam, with their heartland on Syria's Mediterranean coast. The Assads are Alawites.The founder of the regime, Bashar's father Hafez al-Assad, built his power on the Alawite minority, around 10% of the population. Just the sound of the Alawite accent, especially coming from a man in uniform – or worse, a leather-jacketed operative from one of the regime's intelligence agencies – used to make other Syrians nervous.Syria will not recover if sectarian killing continues. Stopping more serious outbreaks of violence in the next 12 months is the government's most serious challenge.The slow pace of justiceJust before the anniversary of Assad's fall, the UN human rights office (OHCHR) expressed serious concern about the slow pace of justice. A spokesman said, \"While the interim authorities have taken encouraging steps towards addressing past violations, these steps are only the beginning of what needs to be done.\"Some Syrians have taken matters into their own hands, along, at times, with government forces. The OHCHR said that hundreds have been killed over the past year \"by the security forces and affiliated groups, elements associated with the former government, local armed groups and unidentified armed individuals\".They added: \"Other reported violations and abuses include sexual violence, arbitrary detentions, destruction of homes, forced evictions, and restrictions on freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly.\"Alawite, Druze, Christian and Bedouin communities were mainly affected by the violence, the OHCHR said, which has been fed by rising hate speech both on- and offline.Anadolu via Getty ImagesA graduation ceremony for general security personnel last monthA big risk for 2026 is a repeat of last March's sectarian violence in Alawite areas.In the security vacuum that followed the fall of the Assad regime, the new government attempted to stamp its authority on the Syrian coast with a series of arrests. An investigation by OCHCR found that \"pro-former government fighters responded by capturing, killing, and injuring hundreds of interim government forces\".Damascus responded harshly and lost control of militant armed factions that carried a systematic series of deadly attacks on Alawites.The UN found that some 1,400 people, predominantly civilians, were reported killed in the ensuing massacres. The vast majority were adult men, but victims included approximately 100 women, the elderly and the disabled, as well as children.The Sharaa government cooperated with the UN investigation. Some of its forces managed to rescue Alawites and it has put some of the ringleaders of the massacres on trial. ReutersThe UN found that some 1,400 people, predominantly civilians, were reported killed during sectarian violence in Alawite areas in MarchThe UN Syria Commission of Inquiry confirmed it had found no evidence the authorities had ordered the attacks. But the concern then and for the future was that the Damascus government could not control armed Sunni groups that had supposedly joined its security forces.In July in the southern province of Suweida, serious violence between Druze and Bedouin communities shook the Sharaa administration to its roots. The Druze religion developed out of Islam around a thousand years ago, and its followers, who some Muslims believe are heretics, amount to around 3% of Syria's population.When government forces entered Suweida, supposedly to restore order, they ended up fighting Druze militias. Israel, which has its own Druze community that is fiercely loyal to the Jewish state, intervened. Its airstrikes included the near destruction of the ministry of defence in Damascus. It took a rapid American intervention to force a ceasefire that stopped a spiral down into much worse violence. Tens of thousands of people were driven from their homes and remain displaced.Getty ImagesA UN inquiry found no evidence the authorities had ordered the attacks in March. But the concern was that the Damascus government could not control armed Sunni groupsThe Israel questionIt is still not clear whether Sharaa and his interim government are strong enough to survive another crisis as serious as that. Israel remains a looming and dangerous presence to Syrians.After the fall of Assad, the Israelis launched a series of major air strikes to destroy what was left of the old regime's military capacity. The IDF advanced out of the occupied Golan Heights to take control of more Syrian territory, which it still holds.The Israelis were taking advantage of the chaos in Syria to weaken a country it saw as hostile, destroying weapons it said might be turned in its direction.More from InDepthAttempts by the US to broker a security agreement between Israel and Syria have stalled in the last two months or so.Syria wants to return to an agreement originally negotiated by Henry Kissinger when he was US Secretary of State in 1974. Netanyahu wants Israel to stay in the land it seized and has demanded that Syria demilitarises a large area south of Damascus.In the last month Israel has intensified its ground incursions into Syria. Syria Weekly, which collects data on violence, calculates that there were more than twice as many as the monthly average for the rest of the year.We visited the border village of Beit Jinn, which was raided by IDF troops on 28 November. The IDF said they were arresting Sunni militants who were planning attacks. Local men fought back, wounding six Israelis as the raiding party was forced into a hurried retreat, abandoning a military vehicle that they later destroyed with an airstrike. The Israelis killed at least 13 local people and wounded dozens, state media reported.It was a sign of how hard it will be to broker a security deal between Syria and Israel. The Damascus government called it a war crime. Calls for retaliation intensified.Dia Images via Getty ImagesThe border village of Beit Jinn was raided by IDF troops on 28 NovemberIn Washington, Trump was clearly worried by the raid. He posted on his Truth Social platform that he was \"very satisfied\" with Sharaa's efforts at stabilising Syria.He warned that it was \"very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria's evolution into a prosperous state\".In Beit Jinn I met Khalil Abu Daher on his way back from hospital, his arm in plaster after surgery for a bullet wound. He invited me to his home, which is close to where the Israelis were exchanging fire with village men.Khalil told me he was here with his family when the Israelis entered the village at 3:30 am. They tried to find a safe place.\"I was in my house with my children. We went from one room to another. They shot at my two daughters. One was hit, and the other died instantly. When I picked her up, I was shot in the hand.\"The dead girl was 17-year-old Hiba Abu Daher, who was shot in the stomach. They sheltered, Khalil said, alongside Hiba's dead body for two hours before they were rescued and taken to hospital.When I visited, Khalil's nine-year-old daughter was lying on a blanket on the sofa, recovering from surgery to take a bullet out of her hip.Khalil's nine-year-old daughter lying on the sofa, recovering from surgery to take a bullet out of her hipThe girls' mother, Umm Mohammad, sat with the women of the family, desperately worried about the future.\"We want peace of mind,\" she told me. \"We want to live in our homes, and we want a clinic and medical staff because we don't have one.\"We also want a doctor because there isn't one in Beit Jinn, nor is there a pharmacy. We want security.\"'We go to sleep and wake up afraid'A year after the end of Assad's rule, Syria's new rulers have scored some important achievements. They are still in power, which was not guaranteed when they took Damascus. President Trump has become Sharaa's most important backer. Sanctions are being lifted. The economy is showing signs of life and business deals are being done, including modernising oil and gas installations and privatising the airports in Damascus and Aleppo.But deals that are in the pipeline have not yet changed the lives of most Syrians. The government has no rebuilding fund. Reconstruction is up to individuals. Sectarian tensions are unresolved and could ignite again. The US-mediated dialogue with Israel has stalled.NurPhoto via Getty ImagesThe government has no rebuilding fund. Reconstruction is up to individualsBenjamin Netanyahu insists that Damascus might demilitarise a large area of southern Syria and shows no signs of ordering the IDF to pull back. Both points amount to a major violation of Syrian sovereignty. The Beit Jinn raid makes it harder for Damascus to offer concessions.Government in Damascus is centred on Sharaa himself, assisted by the foreign minister Asaad al-Shaibani and a few trusted associates. No serious attempt seems to be happening to create an accountable framework of government.Syria without the Assad family is a better place. But Umm Mohammad summed up the feelings of far too many Syrians.\"The future is difficult. We have nothing, not even schools. Our children are living in hell here. There is no safety for them. How will we live?\"We want safety. We go to sleep and wake up afraid.\"Top picture credits: AFP via Getty Images and Anadolu via Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

After a month-long trial, he was found guilty by a jury on Monday, eliciting cheers and tears from members of the public gathered in court.It is the second trial for Singh, after a trial in March ended in a hung jury.A health store worker and animal shelter volunteer, Ms Cordingley was well known, and well loved, by the local community and her death caused an outpouring of grief across the state of Queensland.Ms Cordingley was \"repeatedly\" stabbed with a sharp object and put in a shallow sandy grave with \"little or no hope of surviving\", the Cairns Supreme Court heard.Singh - originally from the Indian state of Punjab - had been living in Innisfail at the time of the killing, a town about two hours south of the crime scene. Detectives had quickly zeroed in on him as a suspect, but he had already flown out of the country, leaving his wife, three children and parents behind, the trial heard.GettyRajwinder Singh fled to India the day after Toyah Cordingley's body was found.Prosecutors alleged this was an indication of his guilt. Though circumstantial, their case would show the evidence pointed to Singh \"and eliminated others\", the court heard.That evidence included DNA recovered from a stick at the scene which was 3.8 billion times more likely to have come from Singh than a random member of the public. They also said the movements of Ms Cordingley's phone matched the movements of Singh's car in the moments after the attack.Singh will return to court for a sentencing hearing on Tuesday.",

    "body": "2 hours agoKhashayar Joneidi, BBC Persian CorrespondentThe US has deported a second group of Iranian nationals, officials in Tehran said, as the Trump administration continues its immigration enforcement efforts.A chartered plane carrying more than 50 Iranians flew out of Mesa, Arizona, on Sunday, travelling through Cairo and Kuwait before arriving in Iran, according to reports.   Tehran's foreign ministry confirmed the Iranian nationals' return to Iran. US immigration officials could not \"confirm or deny a flight\" for security reasons.The first deportation flight took off from the US in late September, in a rare instance of cooperation between Iran and the US. Many Iranian nationals say they come to the US because they fear persecution at home.Father Joseph Bach, a member of Borderland Companions of Hope, a Franciscan organisation that provides support to migrants, said he has been informed through his contacts inside an Arizona detention facility that Christian converts were among those removed. He also said some detainees had identified as LGBT.Christian converts and members of the LGBT community are groups that face severe legal and social repercussions in Iran.Father Joseph called the deportations \"the most unchristian thing to do\", adding, \"It's scary, it concerns me, it is not OK. I call this a death flight.\"Iranian authorities have facilitated the repatriation efforts. An Iranian consular official said the deported nationals had \"announced their willingness for return following continuation of anti-immigration and discriminative policy against foreign nationals, particularly Iranians, by the United States\", the Iran's judiciary-affiliated Mizan News Agency reports.However, one detainee who spoke with the BBC said not all those who were deported were willing to return.One person who was on a list for potential deportation told the BBC he and his partner crossed into the US on foot from Mexico earlier this year. Speaking from an immigration detention centre in Arizona, he said he feared for his life if he returned to Iran.The latest deportations come as already severely strained relations between the two countries further deteriorated in June, after the US bombed Iran's nuclear facilities.The removals highlight the US government's hardline immigration posture under President Donald Trump, who made border security and reducing unauthorised migration central to his political agenda.",

    "body": "At least 30 people were injured after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit north-eastern Japan on Monday night, forcing thousands of people to evacuate their homes.The quake occurred at 23:15 (14:15 GMT) at a depth of 50km (31mi), about 80km off the coast of the Aomori region, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. It prompted tsunami warnings which have now been lifted, while waves of 70cm (27in) were seen.Some train services have been suspended and thousands of homes have been left without power as a result. Authorities have also warned that a stronger tremor could occur in the coming days - urging the public to remain on high alert for at least a week, according to local media reports.Addressing citizens affected by the earthquake, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said: \"Reconfirm your daily earthquake preparedness, such as ensuring that you secure furniture, and prepare to evacuate immediately if you feel shaking.\"Orders were issued for about 90,000 residents to evacuate, according to Reuters news agency.The Aomori prefectural government said around 2,700 homes have been left without power. East Japan Railway has also suspended some services along the north-eastern coast.The Japanese government has set up a response office within the prime minister's crisis management centre and convened an emergency team, chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara has said.\"We are making every effort to assess the damage and implement emergency disaster response measures, including rescue and relief operations,\" he added.Following the tremors, Japanese electric company Tohoku Electric Power said no irregularities were reported at its Higashidori and Onagawa nuclear power plants as a result of the quake, Tohoku Electric Power said.None were detected either at the disabled Fukushima nuclear power station site, the Japanese authorities told the International Atomic Energy Agency.Fukushima was damaged when a magnitude 9.0 quake struck off the country's eastern coast on 11 March 2011.That quake, the most powerful ever recorded in Japan, triggered a tsunami which swept over the main island of Honshu, killing more than 18,000 people and wiping entire towns off the map.Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries. It sits on the Ring of Fire and, as a result, experiences about 1,500 earthquakes a year.Earlier this year, Japan's earthquake investigation panel said there was a 60-90% chance that a megaquake would occur in the Nankai Trough within the next 30 years, with worst-case scenarios suggesting it would cause trillions in damage, and potentially kill hundreds of thousands.Earthquakes along the Nankai Trough - an area of seismic activity which stretches along Japan's Pacific coast - have already been responsible for thousands of deaths.",

Japan said there were two such incidents Saturday off its southern Okinawa islands.Japan said it scrambled fighter jets in response to the Chinese J-15 fighter jets, while Beijing accused Tokyo of \"harassing\" its forces during a training exercise. No injuries or damage were reported.Diplomatic ties between Japan and China have spiralled since last month, after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested that Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan.Beijing views self-governed Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to \"reunite\" with it.Both sides have since engaged in increasingly hostile rhetoric towards each other, with the widening rift affecting daily life for citizens in both countries.Last week, China and Japan's coast guards gave conflicting accounts of a confrontation near disputed islands in the East China Sea.A Japanese defence ministry official said the intention of the Chinese J-15 jets was \"unclear\", but added that there was \"no need\" to lock on to the Japanese planes if their intention was to locate other aircraft.The J-15 jets, which were launched from China's Liaoning aircraft carrier, first locked its radar on Japanese jets at 16:32 local time on Saturday (07:32 GMT) and again at around 18:37.The official added that the Japanese aircraft \"did not do anything that could be considered a provocation\".\"It is extremely regrettable. Japan has strongly protested to the Chinese side, and we firmly requested measures to prevent recurrence,\" Takaichi told reporters Sunday in Wajima, Ishikawa prefecture.\"We will respond calmly and resolutely,\" she said.The Chinese navy however said Japan's claim was \"completely inconsistent with the facts\" and told Tokyo to \"immediately stop slandering and smearing\". It added that its training exercise in the area had been previously announced.This comes two weeks after Japan scrambled aircraft when a suspected Chinese drone was detected off Yonaguni, island near Taiwan. Tokyo has said it is planning to deploy missiles from Yonaguni in a move that has angered Beijing.A month of heightened tensions have seen China ask its citizens to avoid travelling to Japan.China has also banned the importation of seafood from Japan and suspended the screening of popular Japanese films.",

    "body": "16 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterGetty ImagesX has blocked the European Commission from making adverts on its platform - a move which comes a few days after it fined Elon Musk's site €120m (£105m) over its blue tick badges.Nikita Bier, who has a senior role at the social media site, accused the European Union (EU) regulator of trying to \"take advantage\" of \"an exploit\" in its advertising system to promote its post about the fine on Friday.\"It seems you believe that the rules should not apply to your account,\" he said. \"Your ad account has been terminated.\"A European Commission spokesperson told BBC News the Commission \"always uses all social media platforms in good faith\".X's fine, issued on Friday, was the first under the EU's Digital Services Act.The EU regulator said the platform's blue tick system was \"deceptive\" because the firm was not \"meaningfully verifying users\".\"This deception exposes users to scams, including impersonation frauds, as well as other forms of manipulation by malicious actors,\" it said.It claimed X was also failing to provide transparency around its adverts, and was not giving researchers access to public data.The social media platform has been given 60 days to respond to the Commission about concerns surrounding its blue checkmarks, or face extra penalties.Following the fine, Elon Musk posted on his platform to say the EU \"should be abolished\", and retweeted a response from another X user comparing it to fascism.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accused the EU regulator of attacking and censoring US firms, adding, \"the days of censoring Americans online are over\".'Never been abused like this'The dispute originated with Mr Bier, who accused the Commission of activating a rarely-used account \"to take advantage of an exploit\".He claimed it had posted a link which itself deceived users - tricking them into thinking it was a video \"to artificially increase its reach\".He said the \"exploit\", which had \"never been abused like this\", had now been removed.Ad accounts on X are used by businesses to create and analyse paid advertising campaigns and run \"promoted\" posts on the site, separate from the users' X profile. In response, a European Commission spokesperson told BBC News that it was \"simply using the tools that platforms themselves are making available to our corporate accounts\".\"⁠We expect these tools to be fully in line with the platforms' own terms and conditions, as well as with our legislative framework,\" it said.And it is not the first time there has been disagreement between X and global regulators.In 2024, Brazil's Supreme Court lifted a ban on X after it agreed to pay 28 million reais ($5.1m; £3.8m), and blocked accounts accused of spreading misinformation. The previous year, Australia's internet safety watchdog fined it A$610,000 ($386,000; £317,360) for failing to cooperate with a probe into anti-child abuse practices.",

    "body": "Thieves snatch eight Matisse artworks from library in Brazil5 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterAFP via Getty ImagesThe thieves reportedly walked into the library during normal opening hoursTwo armed men have stolen eight engravings by French artist Matisse and at least another five by Brazilian painter Cândido Portinari from a library in São Paulo.  Brazilian officials say the thieves held up a security guard and an elderly couple who were visiting the library on Sunday, before making off with the artworks on foot.On Monday, authorities said they had found the \"escape vehicle\", and several hours later one of the suspects had been arrested, authorities said.The heist comes less than two months after the art world was rocked by a brazen break-in at the Louvre museum in Paris, where thieves made off with priceless jewels. The engravings stolen from Biblioteca Mário de Andrade formed part of a joint exhibition with the São Paulo Museum of Modern Art.The thieves targeted the exhibition, entitled From Book to Museum, on its final day.They reportedly entered the library by the main entrance at 10:00 (13:00 GMT) on Sunday, and left by the same route, heading towards the nearest metro station.Bibilioteca Mário de Andrade is the country's second largest library and officials say that its building in the centre of São Paulo has cameras with facial recognition technology. The city itself also has an extensive security camera system. Brazilian news website G1 published a video purporting to show the two men rushing along a road, carrying between them what seems to be a sack with paintings in it.In a statement posted online, the São Paulo government said that the first alleged thief had been arrested following \"analysis of security cameras that recorded the criminal act\".Officials have not yet released a detailed list of the stolen works, but according to Folha de São Paulo newspaper, a collage Matisse made for the limited-edition art book Jazz is among those taken.Matisse is widely considered to be one of the 20th Century's most influential artists and art critics say the value of the stolen works is \"incalculable\".The thieves also took at least five engravings by Portinari, created to illustrate a special edition of the novel Menino de engheno (Plantation Boy) by Brazilian writer José Lins do Rego.Portinari, who often painted rural workers and labourers, is one of the most significant Brazilian Modernist artists.

    "body": "New York City Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani will live in the Manhattan mansion that his predecessors have called home, leaving behind a rent-stabilised apartment that became the subject of heated debate during his campaign.Gracie Mansion, which dates to 1799, has served at the residence for most New York City mayors since the World War II era. But Mamdani, for whom affordable housing is a central issue, did not confirm he would live there immediately following his victory in November.\"This decision came down to our family's safety and the importance of dedicating all of my focus on enacting the affordability agenda New Yorkers voted for,\" Mamdani said in a statement on Monday.Mamdani lived in the Astoria neighbourhood in the borough of Queens. The area, home to many middle-class families, is famous for its abundance of immigrant communities and global cuisine.\"To Astoria: thank you for showing us the best of New York City,\" Mamdani's statement said.\"While I may no  longer live in Astoria, Astoria will always live inside me and the work I do,\" he said.During his campaign, Mamdani tied his core platform - freeze the rent – to his own housing situation. But his rivals, mainly former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, criticised Mamdani for occupying the apartment even though he came from a famous family. His mother is the filmmaker Mira Nair, and his father, Mahmood Mamdani, is a professor at Columbia University.Not every mayor has chosen to live at Gracie Mansion.Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire entrepreneur and founder of the eponymous financial terminals, chose to live in his own townhouse on the Upper East Side neighbourhood of Manhattan during his three terms, which ended in 2012.Instead, Bloomberg said he believed it should be a space for public city functions, and pushed for an extensive renovation of the aging mansion.When Mamdani moves into Gracie Mansion sometime around his inauguration on 1 January, he will find himself in surroundings very different than his modest Astoria digs.With its butter yellow paint, green shutters, and white railings, Gracie Mansion is a wedding cake of a house overlooking the East River. Inside, the lower floor of the Federal-style mansion is decorated in the spirit of the home's original era.The compound, which reportedly has five bedrooms, also has enhanced security to protect the mayor and his family.Some residents have alleged that Gracie Mansion also has supernatural lodgers. Chirlane McCray, the wife of former mayor Bill De Blasio, told reporters that doors occasionally opened and closed by themselves, and the floorboards creaked eerily.Outgoing Mayor Eric Adams was more certain. \"I don't care what anyone says,\" he declared in 2022. \"There are ghosts in there, man.\"Mamdani's current apartment is rent stabilised, meaning the city sets limits on how much landlords can raise the rent each year. New Yorkers consider these apartments valuable lifelines as the cost of housing outpaces what many can afford.Records showed Mamdani paid about $2,300 (£1,725) each month for his apartment. According to the real estate platform Zillow, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in New York City is $3,500 (£2,625) a month.",

    "body": "9 hours agoMadeline HalpertGetty ImagesFTC member Rebecca Slaughter sued Trump after she and another Democratic-appointed member were fired in MarchThe US Supreme Court's conservative majority appeared to side on Monday with the Trump administration in a case that could have major implications for the independence of federal agencies long shielded from the White House. The case, Trump v Slaughter, stems from President Donald Trump's firing in March of Rebecca Slaughter, alongside another Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).The court heard more than two hours of arguments over whether Trump could fire her, since federal law says an commissioner can only be fired for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office\". The court's decision is not expected to be announced for several months.Ms Slaughter sued Trump after she was ousted earlier this year for being \"inconsistent with [the] Administration's priorities\". Trump has argued that a president should be able to have full control over government agencies, even those set up by Congress to be shielded from presidential interference.When the FTC was established in 1914 - to protect the public from deceptive business practices and unfair competition - Congress passed a law saying a president could only remove commissioners for cause and that the five-member commission can have no more than three members of the same political party. Trump appointed Ms Slaughter in 2018 to fill a Democratic position on the FTC, and she was later reappointed by former President Joe Biden. Similar firing rules exist for other independent agencies like the National Labor Relations Board. The law was put to the test in 1935, when President Franklin Roosevelt tried to remove a member of the FTC, leading the Supreme Court to uphold the independence of certain federal agencies like the trade commission.  In the 90-year-old ruling known as Humphrey's Executor, the court found that, while the president has the ability to remove executive officers without cause, such a power does not apply to agencies like the FTC that are \"neither political nor executive, but predominantly quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative\".During oral arguments on Monday, the four conservative justices on the court appeared to disagree with Ms Slaughter's lawyers' arguments that this would be an unacceptable expansion of Trump's powers.Arguing for the Trump administration, US Solicitor General John Sauer called the Humphrey's rule an \"indefensible outlier\" and \"decaying husk\" of a Supreme Court decision that should be overturned.\"I think broad delegations to unaccountable independent agencies raise enormous constitutional and real-world problems for individual liberty,\" said conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch.The three liberal justices pressed why the court would overturn a 90-year-old precedent.\"You're asking us to destroy the structure of government,\" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, \"and to take away from Congress its ability to protect its idea that the government is better structured with some agencies that are independent.\"Justice Elena Kagan suggested that allowing Trump to remove Ms Slaughter could have wide-reaching impacts, asking: \"The question is, where does this lead?\"\"Employees are wielding executive power all over the place, and yet we've had civil service laws that give them substantial protection from removal for over a century,\" she said.Lawyer Amit Agarwal, representing Ms Slaughter, said independent auditing groups like the FTC  have a long history in US politics.\"Multi-member commissions with members enjoying some kind of removal protection have been part of our story since 1790. So if petitioners are right, all three branches of government have been wrong from the start,\" he said.The court has already issued one ruling against Ms Slaughter, which analysts suggested could indicate how it would ultimately rule.A lower court ruled that Ms Slaughter had been illegally removed from the FTC, leading the Trump administration to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. In a 6-3 decision, the conservative-majority court in September issued an emergency order maintaining her firing until the case could be heard. The Supreme Court is also set to take up at a later date a separate case on whether Trump had the power to remove Lisa Cook, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. ",

In another video, the pair are seen trying sushi.Neither Perry nor Trudeau have publicly commented on their relationship. But speculation has been growing for months with multiple pictures of the two together.Trudeau was seen attending Perry's concert earlier this year, fuelling rumours of a romance with the pop star.Perry was visiting Japan as part of her global Lifetimes Tour.The 41-year-old accompanied her Instagram carousel with the caption: \"Tokyo times on tour and more.\"Earlier this week, Trudeau, 53, also reposted a photograph of the pair together alongside the former prime minister of Japan, Fumio Kishida, and his wife, Yuko.He wrote on X: \"Great to see you [Fumio Kishida]. Katy and I were so glad to have the chance to sit down with you and Yuko.\"Thank you, Fumio, for your friendship and your continued commitment to both the international rules-based order and to a better future for everyone.\"Last month, the pair appeared to confirm their relationship after being photographed holding hands at an event in Paris.Celebrity news site TMZ published the photographs and video footage of the pair walking hand-in-hand before getting into a car. Trudeau was seen helping the singer into the back seat as photographers called out.The appearance in Paris coincided with Perry's 41st birthday and appeared to mark their first public outing as a couple.Perry and Trudeau did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.During a recent tour in London, Perry did appear to allude to her relationship status.After a fan proposed to her from the audience during a performance, the singer joked: \"I wish you'd asked me 48 hours ago.\" This was just days after photographs of her and Trudeau were first published online.Perry was previously in a long-term relationship with actor Orlando Bloom. The pair, who were together for a decade and share a daughter, separated over the summer.Trudeau, who served as prime minister of Canada from 2015 to 2025, was previously married to Sophie Grégoire for 18 years before the couple split up in the summer of 2023. They share three children.",

    "body": "A protective shield covering the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in Ukraine can no longer provide its main containment function following a drone strike earlier this year, according to a UN watchdog.  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors found that the massive structure, built over the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster, had lost its \"primary safety functions including the confinement capability\".In February, Ukraine accused Russia of targeting the power plant - a claim the Kremlin denied.The IAEA said repairs were \"essential\" to \"prevent further degradation\" of the nuclear shelter. However environmental expert Jim Smith told the BBC: \"It is not something to panic about.\"Prof Smith from the University of Portsmouth in the UK, who has studied the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster, said the biggest danger linked to the site was disturbing radioactive dust.But he said that \"the risk is low\" because contaminated dust is contained within a thick concrete \"sarcophagus\" which is covered by the protective shield. The 1986 explosion at Chernobyl blasted radioactive material into the air, triggering a public health emergency across Europe.In response, the former Soviet Union constructed the sarcophagus over the nuclear reactor. The sarcophagus only had a 30-year lifespan, prompting the need for the protective shell to prevent radioactive material leaking out over the next 100 years.The IAEA said a team had completed a safety assessment of the site last week after it was \"severely damaged\" by the drone strike. The attack caused a fire in the outer cladding of the steel structure.Inspectors said there was no permanent damage to shell's load-bearing structures or monitoring systems and some repairs had been carried out on the roof.But IAEA director general Rafael Grossi, said: \"Timely and comprehensive restoration remains essential to prevent further degradation and ensure long-term nuclear safety.\"Since the beginning of December, the UN's nuclear watchdog has been assessing Ukraine's energy infrastructure as the country continues to defend itself against Russia.Overnight, Russia launched airstrikes on the city of Kremenchuk, a major industrial hub in the centre of Ukraine. As well as assessing Chernobyl, the IAEA has been inspecting electrical substations linked to nuclear safety and security.Mr Grossi said: \"They are absolutely indispensable for providing the electricity all nuclear power plants need for reactor cooling and other safety systems.\"They are also needed to distribute the electricity that they produce to households and industry.\"",

    "body": "Donald Trump has slammed Democrat Henry Cuellar's \"lack of loyalty\" for not defecting to the Republican party after he was pardoned by the US president. In issuing his pardon on Wednesday, Trump said the Texas representative - who was charged last year with bribery and money laundering - had been politically targeted by the Biden administration after he \"bravely spoke out against Open Borders\". Hours after he was pardoned, Cuellar filed for re-election as a Democrat, dashing Republicans' hope that he might switch parties and pad their narrow majority in the House of Representatives.\"Such a lack of LOYALTY,\" Trump wrote of Cuellar on social media. \"Oh' well, next time, no more Mr. Nice guy!\"The Justice Department, under the Biden administration, charged that Cuellar and his wife had accepted $600,000 (£450,600) from Azerbaijan's state-owned oil company and an unnamed Mexican bank in exchange for advancing their interests in Congress. The couple, who have maintained their innocence, were charged with 14 counts in 2024, including conspiracy, bribery, wire fraud, money laundering and violating a ban on acting as agents of a foreign organisation.In his Sunday social media post, Trump accused \"radical left\" Democrats of \"mercilessly\" going after Cuellar - who is a moderate Democrat - in an \"evil quest\" to \"destroy\" him and his family \"all because Henry strongly wanted, correctly, BORDER SECURITY!\"Trump said in the lengthy post that he had never spoken to the congressman or his family but \"felt very good about fighting\" for his family because they were \"treated sooo BADLY!\" Trump added that despite his pardon, Cuellar decided to run again as a Democrat, \"continuing to work with the same Radical Left Scum that just weeks before wanted him and his wife to spend the rest of their lives in Prison - And probably still do!\"And that \"lack of loyalty\", Trump wrote, would not sit well with Texas voters or with Cuellar's daughters, who had written a letter to the president urging him to pardon their parents. Still, Cuellar doubled down on his intentions to remain in the Democratic party, telling Fox News on Sunday: \"I'm an American, I'm a Texan and I'm a Democrat - in that order.\"When asked to respond to Trump's social media post, Cuellar said: \"I am a conservative Democrat, but I will work with the president.\"Cuellar added that Trump was on his mind while he attended church on Sunday morning. \"I prayed for the president,\" he said. \"I prayed for his family, and I prayed for the presidency because if the president succeeds, the country succeeds.\" Trump's attack on Cuellar is the latest example of the president expecting loyalty from those he helps.   A group of federal labour unions filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration last month over what they called a \"loyalty question\" included in thousands of federal job applications. The question asks applicants to identify Trump policy initiatives that are significant to them, and to describe how they personally would advance Trump's agenda. Trump has long that said loyalty is the most important thing to him. \"I value loyalty above everything else - more than brains, more than drive, and more than energy,\" he once said.  ",

    "body": "Russia has welcomed US President Donald Trump's new National Security Strategy, calling it \"largely consistent\" with Moscow's vision. The 33-page document, unveiled by the US administration this week, suggests Europe is facing \"civilisational erasure\" and does not cast Russia as a threat to the US. Combatting foreign influence, ending mass migration, and rejecting the EU's perceived practice of \"censorship\" are mentioned as other priorities in the report. Several EU officials and analysts had pushed back on the strategy, questioning its focus on freedom of expression and likening it to language used by the Kremlin. \"The adjustments we're seeing... are largely consistent with our vision,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in an interview published by Russia's state news agency Tass on Sunday. \"We consider this a positive step,\" he said, adding that Moscow would continue to analyse the document before drawing strong conclusions. The strategy adopts a softer language towards Russia, which EU officials worry could weaken its stance towards Moscow as it pushes for an end to the war in Ukraine. In the document, the EU is blamed for blocking US efforts to end the conflict and says that the US must \"re-establish strategic stability to Russia\" which would \"stabilise European economies\".It appears to endorse efforts to influence policy on the continent, noting that US policy should prioritise \"resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations\".The new report also calls for the restoration of \"Western identity\", and claims that Europe will be \"unrecognisable in 20 years or less\" and its economic issues are \"eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilisational erasure\".\"It is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies,\" the document states.In stark contrast, the document celebrates the influence of \"patriotic European parties\" and says \"America encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit\".As the EU engages in ongoing talks with the Trump administration to set out a peace deal in Ukraine, some officials emphasised their lasting relationship with the US, while raising \"questions\" over the document. \"The US will remain our most important ally in the [Nato] alliance. This alliance, however, is focused on addressing security policy issues,\" German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Friday. \"I believe questions of freedom of expression or the organisation of our free societies do not belong [in the strategy], in any case at least when it comes to Germany.\"In a social media post addressed to his \"American friends\", Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that \"Europe is your closest ally, not your problem\" and noted their \"common enemies\".\"This is the only reasonable strategy of our common security. Unless something has changed.\"Meanwhile, former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt wrote that the document \"places itself to the right of the extreme right\".The Trump administration has fostered links with the far-right AfD party in Germany, which has been classified as extreme right by German intelligence.Promoting an \"America First\" message, the strategy says the US intends to target alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean, considering possible military action in Venezuela.The US also calls on an increased defence spending from Japan, South Korea, Australia and Taiwan.Democrats in Congress warned that the document could shatter US foreign relations. Representative Jason Crow of Colorado, who sits on House committees overseeing intelligence and the armed forces, called the strategy \"catastrophic to America's standing in the world\".New York Representative Gregory Meeks said it \"discards decades of value-based, US leadership\".Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "A water leak at the Louvre museum in Paris has damaged hundreds of works, just weeks after thieves stole priceless French crown jewels from the museum in broad daylight.The museum's deputy administrator, Francis Steinbock, said between 300-400 works, mostly books, were affected by the leak - and that the count was ongoing. Mr Steinbock told French media the damage occurred in the Egyptian department and that the volumes are \"those consulted by Egyptologists\", but that \"no precious books\" were affected. The problem that caused the leak, which was discovered in late November, had been known for years, and repairs are scheduled for next year, Mr Steinbock added.The volumes will be dried, sent to a bookbinder and restored before being returned to the shelves.Mr Steinbock described the books as \"Egyptology journals\" and \"scientific documentation\" from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. \"No heritage artefacts have been affected by this damage,\" Mr Steinbock told the Agence France-Presse news agency.He added: \"At this stage, we have no irreparable and definitive losses in these collections.\"The leak is the third major issue faced by the museum - which is the most visited in the world - in as many months. In November, structural weaknesses prompted the partial closure of one of the galleries hosting Greek vases and offices, and on 19 October, four burglars made off with jewels worth €88m (£76m; $102m), exposing glaring security gaps. The jewels still haven't been recovered, and the museum has since moved some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France.A report published in October by France's public audit body, known as the Cour des Comptes, criticised the museum's excessive spending on artwork, which it said was \"to the detriment of the maintenance and renovation of buildings.\" ",

    "body": "20 hours agoJake KwonSeoul correspondentA  South Korean court has sentenced a woman who blackmailed football star Son Heung-min to four years in prison. The woman in her 20s and her accomplice, a man in his 40s, were found guilty of blackmailing the former Tottenham captain by saying she was pregnant with his child.The woman had approached Son sometime last year claiming she was carrying his child, when in fact she did not know whether that was the case, a Seoul district court heard, according to local media.She extorted $300 million won ($200,000; £153,000) from him and threatened to go public with the allegation if he did not comply.The woman spent the money on luxury and designer goods, AFP news agency reported.\"[The woman] insists she received the money as compensation and portrays herself as a victim,\" prosecutors told the court on Monday. \"But her claims do not fully match the facts,\" they said, accusing her of planning the crime \"thoroughly\".The woman's accomplice, who had threatened Son 15 times to get the money, was handed a two-year jail term for attempted blackmail.When they demanded more money this year, Son went to the police. The judge said the woman and her accomplice had abused Son's celebrity for their crime, and that Son appeared to have gone through \"intense mental anguish\" after the case was reported in the media. Son was in October named the second-highest paid footballer in Major League Soccer (MLS), North America's top-tier football league akin to England's Premier League.In August, the 33-year-old left Tottenham after 10 years of service to join the Los Angeles Football Club, marking the most expensive transfer in MLS' history.Widely regarded as one of Asia's best football stars, Son enjoys huge popularity in his home country and the region.In 2022, while he was still with the Spurs, he became the first Asian to win the Premier League's golden boot award presented annually to the leading goal scorer in the league.

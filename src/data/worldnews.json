    "body": "20 minutes agoReutersLuigi Mangione will not face the death penalty if convicted of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, a federal judge has ruled.US District Judge Margaret Garnett dismissed two of the four federal charges against the 27 year old, including murder through use of a firearm, which carried the potential death sentence.Mangione was arrested days after he allegedly shot Thompson as he was walking into a conference on a busy Manhattan street in December 2024.He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, including the two remaining federal counts of stalking and separate state murder charges. Jury selection in the federal trial is slated to begin on 8 September with opening statements starting on 13 October. But state prosecutors are seeking to try Mangione as soon as 1 July.In her ruling, Judge Garnett said two of the four federal charges did not \"meet the federal statutory definition of a 'crime of violence' as matter of law\". She noted that her decision was \"solely to foreclose the death penalty as an available punishment to be considered by the jury\" ultimately responsible for determining Mangione's conviction.Garnett also said prosecutors would be allowed to feature evidence from Mangione's seized backpack he was wearing at the time of his arrest.Among the items in the backpack were a ghost gun, fake IDs, and a notebook with writings that detailed Mangione's private health care system grievances. Defence attorneys had sought to dismiss that evidence from trial, arguing that authorities obtained it in an illegal search. Mangione is also facing nine charges in a separate case brought by New York state prosecutors, including second-degree murder.",

    "body": "10 hours agoHidayatullah,BBC Indonesian, Aceh, IndonesiaandKoh EweGetty ImagesA woman was crying during the public caning in AcehA couple in Indonesia has been caned 140 times for having sex outside marriage and drinking alcohol because it violates Sharia, or Islamic religious law.The 21-year-old woman fainted after what authorities said was a record number of strokes to be meted out in a public caning session in the Aceh province.Three female officers took turns striking her with a rattan cane, while she cried. After she collapsed, she was carried off the stage by female officers to an ambulance.The couple were caned on Thursday along with four others, including an officer from the Islamic police force, who were all found guilty of violating Sharia. Caning is a common punishment for breaking Islamic law in religiously conservative Aceh, although the practice has long drawn criticism from rights groups who say it's cruel.Under Aceh's Islamic criminal code, sex outside marriage is punishable by 100 strokes of the cane, while consuming alcohol carries 40 strokes.Canings are not regulated properly, says Azharul Husna, the Aceh coordinator for Indonesian rights group Kontras, adding that the rules around such punishments should be \"improved\" to support people after they're caned.The officer from the Islamic police force was caned 23 times, as was his female partner, for being in close proximity in a private place.He was caught alone with her in her house, Muhammad Rizal, the head of Aceh's Islamic police force told BBC Indonesian, adding that the officer would be dismissed. Aceh is the only province in Muslim-majority Indonesia to enforce the Sharia, and punishes many of the offences with public canings. Additional reporting by Astudestra Ajengrastri",

    "body": "Trump and his sons sue IRS and US Treasury over leaked tax information14 hours agoNardine SaadReutersUS President Donald Trump and his sons Eric Trump, left, and Donald Trump Jr, right, have sued the US federal government over tax leaks.US President Donald Trump and his two sons have filed a billion-dollar lawsuit against the federal government over leaks of their business and personal tax returns.The civil complaint, filed in Miami federal court, seeks $10bn (£7.25bn) in damages.The Trump family accuses the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) - the US-wide tax body - and the Treasury Department of failing to prevent the disclosure of \"confidential, personal financial information\" by a former IRS contractor.The contractor, Charles \"Chaz\" Littlejohn, is serving a five-year prison sentence after being convicted of leaking the tax disclosures to US media outlets.Ahead of the 2016 election, Trump said he would not release his tax returns because he was under audit, making him the first in almost 50 years to not disclose the documents. He said the same ahead of his 2020 re-election run. But then in September 2020, just before the November election, The New York Times published an extensive report on Trump's tax returns, revealing he paid only $750 in federal income taxes the year he won the presidency and no taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years.The lawsuit states that both the IRS and Treasury Department \"had a duty to safeguard and protect\" such disclosures from being shared publicly but \"failed to take such mandatory precautions\". Trump, his sons Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump and the Trump Organization said in the lawsuit that they suffered reputational and financial harm, along with public embarrassment from leaks to the New York Times and ProPublica, which \"unfairly tarnished\" their business reputations, portrayed them in a false light and negatively affected their public standing, according to the filing.Littlejohn pleaded guilty in 2023 to stealing tax data from Trump and thousands of wealthy Americans while working as a contractor for the IRS. In 2024, he was sentenced to five years in prison.The lawsuit accuses him of weaponising his access to \"unmasked taxpayer data to further his own personal, political agenda, believing that he was above the law\".\"Littlejohn committed these crimes because he considered President Trump to be 'dangerous' and a 'threat to democracy,' and that disclosure was, in Littlejohn's view, necessary due to political 'norms,'\" the lawsuit says. When asked in a deposition if Littlejohn was looking to cause some kind of harm to Trump, he said: \"Less about harm, more just about a statement. I mean, there's little harm that can actually be done to him, I think... He's shown a remarkable resilience.\"Trump resigned from his namesake company and hundreds of affiliated entities in 2017 before taking office during his first term.",

    "body": "4 hours agoHafsa KhalilReutersMembers of the Kurdish-led SDF queue to settle their status with the Syrian government on 27 January, 2026Syria's government has reached a deal with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia alliance that would see the gradual intergration of Kurdish forces and institutions into the state.This comes after weeks of clashes which saw Syrian troops reclaim large swathes of territory in the north-east that had been under SDF control for more than a decade. US envoy Tom Barrack called it \"a profound and historic milestone in Syria's journey toward national reconciliation, unity, and enduring stability\".Earlier this month - and after its major territorial losses - the SDF agreed to a ceasefire that saw much of its hold brought under government control, but reports of clashes continued.Much like that 14-point agreement, Friday's deal would see SDF withdraw from points of contact, its members join the Syrian army and government, and the integration of its administrative and civil bodies into those of the state.The SDF said the agreement also includes the formation of a military division consisting of three brigades made of its members.The statement on X added that an agreement on the civil and educational rights for Kurdish people was also reached, as well as a guarantee that those displaced would be allowed to return to their homes.Part of the deal saw the transfer of prisons, oil and gas fields - which were under SDF control - to Damascus.Syrian troops seized control of the Omar facility, the country's largest oilfield, after the SDF pulled back. Earlier, the army took the strategic Tabqa dam on the Euphrates river.The Kurds previously controlled nearly a third of Syria's territory with the support of the US after it helped defeat the Islamic State (IS) group. Their recent losses mark the biggest change of control in the country since the toppling of former leader Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, which ended Syria's 13-year civil war.Since leading the rebel offensive that overthrew the Assad regime, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa has vowed to reunify a divided Syria. After the ceasefire was agreed on 18 January, he said he hoped it would allow the country to \"end its state of division and move to a state of unity and progress\". Sharaa also issued a decree recognising Kurdish cultural, linguistic and civil rights by making Kurdish a national language, granting nationality to stateless Kurds, and declaring their new year a national holiday.This is the first formal recognition of Kurdish national rights since Syria's independence in 1946.This agreement followed months of stalled negotiations over a March 2025 integration deal, which both sides had accused each other of trying to derail.",

    "body": "1 day agoHugh SchofieldParis correspondent, ParisAFP via Getty ImagesThe proposed bill was approved in the French National Assembly on WednesdayFrance is to enshrine in law the end of so-called \"conjugal rights\" – the notion that marriage means a duty to have sex.A bill approved on Wednesday in the National Assembly adds a clause to the country's civil code to make clear that \"community of living\" does not create an \"obligation for sexual relations\".The proposed law also makes it impossible to use lack of sexual relations as an argument in fault-based divorce.Though unlikely to have a major impact in the courts, supporters hope the law will help deter marital rape.\"By allowing such a right or duty to persist, we are collectively giving our approval to a system of domination and predation by husband on wife,\" said the bill's sponsor, Green MP Marie-Charlotte Garin.\"Marriage cannot be a bubble in which consent to sex is regarded as definitive and for life.\"The law will erase an ambiguity that has persisted despite there being no explicit mention of \"conjugal duty\" in any legal text.Currently, the French civil code defines the duties of marriage as \"respect, fidelity, support and assistance,\" and it says that couples commit themselves to a \"community of living\".Nowhere in the texts is there any mention of \"conjugal\" - ie sexual - rights. The origins of that notion lie in medieval church law.However judges in modern divorce suits have, from time to time, given a broad interpretation to the concept of \"community of living\" to include sexual relations.In a famous case in 2019 a woman was found to have withheld sex from her husband for several years, and he was then granted a \"fault-based\" divorce implying guilt on her part.But the woman then took her case to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which last year condemned France for allowing refusal of sex to be grounds for a fault-based divorce.This was hailed as an important advance by feminist campaigners.The ECHR's decision has made it, in practice, impossible for any French divorce judge to make a similar ruling - which is why the new law is mainly intended as a clarification, with the change unlikely to have a major impact on the courts.For campaigners, the notion that wives have a \"duty\" to agree to sex with their husbands is one that persists in parts of society and needs to be confronted.The Mazan trial of 2024 – where a drugged and unconscious Gisèle Pelicot was repeatedly raped by men invited by her husband - is seen as emblematic. Several defendants said they assumed her consent because of what her husband had told them.In France, as in most other countries, marital rape is now enshrined in law, where prior to 1990 men could argue that marriage implied consent.Since November last year the legal definition of rape in France has also been expanded to include the notion of non-consent.Previously, rape was defined as a sexual act carried out with \"violence, constraint, threat or surprise\". Now it is any act where there is no \"informed,  specific, anterior and revocable\" consent. Silence or an absence of reaction do not imply consent, the law says.If you have been affected by any issues raised in this article, please visit BBC Action Line",

    "body": "2 hours agoWedaeli ChibelushiandNicolas Négoce,BBC AfricaAFP via Getty ImagesBurkina Faso had more than 100 registered parties before the 2022 coupBurkina Faso's junta has announced a ban on all political parties, whose activities have been suspended since the military seized power in 2022.Junta leader Captain Ibrahim Traoré has been criticised for suppressing dissent and the move will be seen as the latest move to tighten control.According to Burkina Faso's Interior Minister Emile Zerbo, the ban is part of plans to \"rebuild the state\" after what he said were \"numerous abuses\" in the country's multiparty system.Zerbo said the system had been \"promoting division among citizens and weakening the social fabric\".Parties were previously banned from holding public gatherings but the new decree stops them from operating altogether.All the assets of the dissolved parties would be transferred to the state, Zerbo said, adding that a draft law would be sent to the Transitional Legislative Assembly \"as soon as possible\".The country had more than 100 registered political parties before the coup, with 15 represented in parliament after the 2020 general election.\"This will not help the country move forward. We're not happy with this,\" a member of a civil society group, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals, told the BBC.\"The regime has been pushing the idea that democracy is useless or harmful for Burkina. [Traoré] may be settling in for the long run but given the country's history, no leader is ever fully secure. Another coup is never far from the horizon.\"The banning of political parties also received some backlash on social media, but a number of other Burkinabes went online to support the junta's decision.\"It is undeniable that a country like Burkina Faso having over 100 political parties creates chaos,\" one Traoré supporter said on X. \"This fragmentation often led to clientelism and corruption, where parties function more like business ventures than civic organisations.\" Traoré's 2022 coup ousted Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, who had taken power only nine months earlier.Burkina Faso is one of several West African countries who have experienced coups, followed by the restriction of political parties and electoral institutions, in recent years.More about Burkina Faso from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "20 minutes agoKhanyisile NgcoboJohannesburgAFP via Getty ImagesSouth Africa has accused Israel of genocide at the International Court of JusticeSouth Africa has expelled Israel's top diplomat in the country for \"violating diplomatic norms\", a move that prompted Israel to kick out a South African envoy in retaliation.The diplomatic row started when South Africa's foreign affairs ministry declared Ariel Seidman, chargé d'affaires at the Israeli embassy, persona non grata and gave him 72 hours to leave the country.Hours later, Israel announced similar action against South Africa's ambassador to Palestine Shaun Edward Byneveldt.Relations between South Africa and Israel have been frosty since South Africa accused Israel of genocide against Palestinians at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), a charge Israel has rejected.South Africa accused Seidman of using official social media platforms to attack Ramaphosa and inviting Israeli officials to the country without permission. The two expelled diplomats were their respective country's highest-ranking representatives as there is no Israeli ambassador in South Africa and likewise no South African ambassador in Israel.Announcing Seidman's expulsion, South Africa's foreign affairs ministry said his actions \"represent a gross abuse of diplomatic privilege\".Shortly afterwards, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Gideon Saar hit back and announced that \"following South Africa's false attacks against Israel in the international arena and the unilateral, baseless step taken\" against [Seidman], Byneveldt is also persona non grata and would have to leave Israel within 72 hours.\"Additional steps will be considered in due course,\" the Israeli government told the BBC.South Africa withdrew its ambassador to Israel in 2018, accusing Israel of an indiscriminate deadly attack on civilians in Gaza. Israel recalled its ambassador to South Africa in 2023 after South Africa took Israel to the ICJ.Seidman was appointed chargé d'affaires at Israel's embassy in South Africa last year and his role also extends to the neighbouring countries of Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius and Namibia.Since then his close ties with Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, a controversial South African king who is also Nelson Mandela's nephew, have come in for criticism from Ramaphosa's government.Dalindyebo visited Israel in December - and met high-ranking officials, without the knowledge of the South African government. On his return home, an Israeli delegation visited the monarch's home province of the Eastern Cape with the promise of aid.Israeli officials recently posted videos and images on X of their trip, which they said was to discuss \"concrete assistance in water, health and agriculture\".South Africa has several recognised monarchs representing different ethnic groups and clans, but they have no formal political power.More BBC stories on South Africa:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "6 minutes agoDanielle KayeandNick Edser,Business reportersReutersUS President Donald Trump has picked Kevin Warsh to lead the US Federal Reserve when current chairman Jerome Powell's four-year term ends in May.Warsh is a former Fed governor and was considered for chair during Trump's first term. He has been an outspoken Fed critic and is expected to support lower interest rates in the near term.The appointment comes amid mounting worries about the Fed's independence, following Trump's increasing attacks on Powell in recent months.Powell has angered Trump by not cutting interest rates quickly enough, and federal prosecutors recently opened a criminal investigation over testimony he gave to the Senate about renovations to Fed buildings.The Department of Justice (DoJ) probe prompted a forceful condemnation from Powell and messages of support from former Fed chairs and central bank heads.Warsh, who served as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011, had re-emerged in recent weeks as a potential choice for the top job as speculation grew over who would replace the under-fire incumbent.Announcing the nomination on Truth Social, Trump said Warsh \"will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best\".Warsh's appointment still needs to be approved by the Senate, meaning it could face lengthy delays.If confirmed for the role, he will take the helm of the Fed at an unusually tense time, as economists and Wall Street investors monitor threats to the central bank's autonomy.Who is Kevin Warsh? Warsh, a 55-year-old economist, is a fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution and serves on the board of courier UPS. He has been an outspoken Fed critic, lambasting everything from the central bank's heavy reliance on data to its use of assets on its balance sheet.Warsh has escalated his rhetoric since emerging as a contender for the top Fed job, going as far as calling for \"regime change\".He had a relatively \"hawkish\" reputation as a Fed governor, meaning he tended to favour higher interest rates and took more seriously concerns about inflation.But he is now seen as a voice that would support lower rates in the near term. He has argued the Fed should shrink its balance sheet in order to bring down short-term interest rates, though some have questioned his logic.The Fed this week voted to hold interest rates steady, despite the White House pushing for a cut. Policymakers are continuing to monitor the effect on the economy of last year's trio of interest rate cuts.There are signs the US employment market is stabilising - job creation is sluggish but the unemployment rate has ticked lower. Inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target.\"Warsh will have to convince his colleagues that rate cuts are appropriate this year, an argument that is unlikely to win unless the labour market shows renewed signs of weakening or inflationary pressures ease materially later this year,\" economists at Deutsche Bank wrote in a research note on Friday.Warsh also has close family connections to Trump's orbit. He is married to Jane Lauder, whose family is known for the Estee Lauder cosmetics group. His father-in-law, billionaire businessman Ronald Lauder, is a long-time Trump donor and ally.Republican Senator Thom Tillis, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, has said he will oppose Trump's nominees until the potential legal case against Powell is resolved.Trump has also taken aim at Fed governor Lisa Cook, whom he wants to remove. He has accused her of engaging in mortgage fraud, which she has denied. The Supreme Court is now assessing the case.Warsh had been seen of one of four leading candidates for the Fed job. The other frontrunners were White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, Fed governor Christopher Waller and Wall Street bond guru Rick Rieder.When Warsh takes up his role, financial markets will keep a close eye on how independently he acts of President Trump.Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said Warsh \"seems like a relatively safe choice\".\"Warsh's long-running hawkish views should help to counteract concerns that he might morph into a full-blown Trump stooge,\" he added.As news of Warsh's impending nomination started to leak out, the dollar strengthened slightly while the price of gold sank by 6%.Stuart Clark, portfolio manager at wealth management business Quilter, said investors would be \"breathing somewhat of a sigh of relief\" at Warsh's nomination.\"Warsh was in contention for the job back in 2017 and as such comes to the role with a level of authority that is respected across the market,\" he added.\"Concerns around Fed independence and an erosion on this should now be tempered, although Warsh's words and actions will be scrutinised by market participants intensely.\"",

    "body": "32 minutes agoBrandon DrenonGetty ImagesFormer CNN host Don Lemon has been arrested after he entered a Minnesota church and filmed anti-immigration enforcement protesters as they disrupted a service.Lemon, now an independent journalist, was taken into custody by federal agents on Thursday night while in Los Angeles covering the Grammy Awards, according to his lawyer Abbe Lowell.\"Don will fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court,\" Lowell said. Lemon, 59, is due to appear in federal court in LA on Friday.He went into the Cities Church in St Paul on 18 January with a group of protesters who said one of the pastors was an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official. \"Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different than what he has always done,\" Lowell said in a statement posted to his client's Instagram account on Friday.The lawyer added: \"This unprecedented attack on the First Amendment and transparent attempt to distract attention from the many crises facing this administration will not stand.\"In his own defence, Lemon said in a recent video: \"Once the protest started in the church, we did an act of journalism, which was report on it.\"US Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Friday that federal agents also arrested three others: Trahern Jeen Crews, local independent journalist Georgia Fort and Jamael Lydell Lundy.She accused them and Lemon of participating in a \"coordinated attack\" on the church. The exact charges the government will bring against Lemon is unclear. The BBC has contacted the Department of Justice for comment. President Donald Trump's administration initially sought to charge eight people involved in the Minnesota church protest with conspiring to deprive rights and interfering with someone's religious freedom in a house of worship.But a magistrate judge who reviewed the evidence approved charges for only three of those involved, excluding Lemon.The government challenged that decision, but an appeals court suggested prosecutors take the case to a federal grand jury - a panel of citizens that evaluates if there is enough evidence to charge someone in a case.Lemon was fired from CNN in April 2023 after 17 years with the company. The morning show host had apologised for on-air comments that Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, then 51, was past her prime. In the Minnesota church protest, he live-streamed with anti-ICE protesters on YouTube. The broadcast began with Lemon standing with the group in a car park where he says: \"This is an operation that is secret.\"I can't tell you what is going to happen, but you're going to watch it live unfold here on 'The Don Lemon Show.'\"He followed the group - whom he called \"resistance protesters\" - into the church, initially without his camera operator. His microphone picked up audio of a woman shouting \"excuse me pastor\", as someone from the church appears to be speaking mid-service. Protesters chant \"Justice for Renee Good\", referring to the US citizen who was fatally shot in her vehicle on 7 January during a confrontation with an ICE officer in Minneapolis.Footage showed a chaotic scene unfolding inside the church, which belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention, as protesters and members of the congregation shout at each other. Lemon repeatedly says he is there as a journalist and is unaffiliated with demonstrators.\"We're not part of the activists, but we're here just reporting on them,\" he says.The pastor says: \"This is unacceptable, it's shameful. It's shameful to interrupt a public gathering of Christians in worship.\" Harmeet Dhillon, of the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, said during an interview with podcaster Megyn Kelly on Friday: \"We're going to pursue this to the ends of the Earth.\"CNN said the arrest of its former employee raised \"profoundly concerning questions about press freedom and the First Amendment\". The network said it would follow Lemon's case closely.This is the second high-profile case of the Trump administration taking action against a journalist this month, raising the alarm of free speech advocates. On 14 January, the FBI showed up unannounced to the home of a Washington Post journalist with a search warrant and seized her devices over the alleged leak of classified information.Protests are continuing in Minnesota, where an operation by federal immigration agents has sparked confrontations that have left two US citizens dead: Renee Good, a mother-of-three, and Alex Pretti, a nurse.",

    "body": "Why China moved so quickly to execute 11 members of a notorious mafia family17 hours agoJonathan HeadSouth East Asia correspondentCCTVDozens of members of the Ming family were sentenced in SeptemberNo-one should be surprised that China has swiftly executed the 11 members of an organised crime family from north-eastern Myanmar who were sentenced to death in  September.China executes more people than anywhere else in the world, according to  human rights groups – the exact figure is a state secret. Officials are often executed for corruption. The accusations made against the Ming family were far more serious.The Ming, Bau, Wei and Liu clans have dominated the remote border town of Laukkaing in Myanmar's impoverished Shan state, since 2009.They rose to power after General Min Aung Hlaing, the current coup leader in Myanmar, led a military operation to drive out the MNDAA, the ethnic insurgent army which had dominated Laukkaing and the area around it since the 1980s.The four families, as they became known, took over and began shifting from the old dependence on opium and methamphetamine production to a new economy based on casinos and, eventually, online fraud.Chinese Ministry of Public SecurityMing Zhenzhen and Ming Guoping in the custody of Chinese policeThey remained close to the Myanmar military; in December 2021, after seizing power in his coup, Min Aung Hlaing feted Liu Zhengxiang, patriarch of the Liu clan, in the capital Nay Pyi Taw and awarded him an honorary title for \"extraordinary contributions to state development\".His Fully Light conglomerate had lucrative businesses all over Myanmar. Other members of the four families were candidates for the military-backed party the USDP.The scam compounds they ran in Laukkaing, though, were brutal, much more so than scam complexes in other parts of Asia. Torture was routine.Tens of thousands of mainly Chinese workers were lured there with promises of well-paid jobs, only to find themselves imprisoned in the compounds. They were forced to run elaborate \"pig-butchering\" scams, where most of the victims were also Chinese. Complaints from the victims, and by the families of those trapped in the compounds multiplied on social media.The most notorious compound in Laukkaing was called Crouching Tiger Villa, run by the Ming family. In October 2023, during what is believed to have been an escape attempt, the guards killed several Chinese nationals. The Chinese authorities felt compelled to take action.With China's apparent blessing the MNDAA and its allies attacked and recaptured Laukkaing, as part of their offensive against the Myanmar army in the ongoing civil war. The MNDAA vowed to stamp out the scam business completely.They detained the heads of the four families and handed more than 60 of their relatives and associates to the Chinese police. Ming Xuechang, the family patriarch, or warlord, killed himself after being captured, authorities said.Getty ImagesShe Zhijiang, who is accused of building an illicit gambling empire in South East Asia, was extradited to China last yearDuring interrogations by the Chinese police one of the family members is reported to have admitted killing someone chosen at random just to demonstrate his strength.These details have been publicised by China to justify its tough treatment of the families. Five of the Bau family are also awaiting execution, while the trials of the Wei and Liu families have not yet concluded.The four families are ethnic Chinese, and had close ties to the authorities on the Chinese side of the border in Yunnan. Their abuses were too close to home for China, and the action against the scam business in Laukkaing has been the most decisive yet.China has also prevailed on Thailand and Cambodia to extradite two Chinese business figures accused of running scam empires, She Zhijiang, who built an entire city in Myanmar's war-torn Karen State, and Chen Zhi, who amassed wealth and power with his Prince Group conglomerate in Cambodia. The Chinese government has also brought tens of thousands of its citizens who were working in scam compounds back to China to face trial.The scam business, though, has simply adapted and evolved. It is still thought to be by far the biggest business in Cambodia, despite pressure from China and the US on the government there to shut it down.And it has kept moving to new areas in Myanmar, even as the more prominent scam complexes like KK Park and Shwe Kokko, on the Thai-Myanmar border, have been forced to close down.",

    "body": "Healthcare, visas and whisky: What did UK and China get from Starmer's visit?8 hours agoSuranjana TewariAsia Business CorrespondentGetty ImagesChina and the UK have called for a reset in economic relationsSir Keir Starmer's visit to China this week is the clearest sign yet the two countries are seeking to end the diplomatic \"ice age\" that has defined their relationship.Both leaders face economic pressures at home and are seeking new opportunities for trade and investment.For Sir Keir, the first UK prime minister to visit China since Theresa May in 2018, the trip was a chance to highlight the strength of British firms in finance, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, clean energy and car making.President Xi Jinping, meanwhile, aimed to show that China can be a reliable partner for Western economies, as US President Donald Trump continues to rattle the global trading system.Although no sweeping free trade deal was reached, the visit marked a cautious but tangible reset of UK–China economic ties.Agreements on visas, services, healthcare, green technology and finance, combined with revived dialogue, might lead to better access for British firms to Chinese markets and greater Chinese investment in the UK.What deals were agreed?The biggest commercial announcement came from AstraZeneca, which promised to invest $15bn (£11bn) in China over the next four years, to expand research and the manufacturing of medicines – the company's biggest investment in China to date.In the energy sector, British firm Octopus Energy is entering the Chinese market for the first time through a partnership with local company PCG Power to develop a digital platform for trading electricity.The project aims to improve efficiency in the power system and support China's efforts to increase the use of renewable energy.For Octopus, which has grown quickly in the UK, the deal allows entry into China's large and growing energy market, where demand for clean energy and digital trading is rising.Greg Jackson, CEO of Octopus Energy who was part of the UK's business delegation to China flagged that the country's scale and innovation have made solar, wind energy and batteries cheaper. \"Now there's a huge opportunity for Britain to succeed as we build the solutions that use these products to cut the cost of electricity,\" he added.China also agreed to halve tariffs on Scotch whisky, a deal the UK government said could generate £250m for the British economy over the next five years.\"Our whisky distilleries are the jewel in Scotland's crown,\" Sir Keir said. This is \"proof that our pragmatic, hard-headed international engagement brings benefits at home\", he added.Scotch whisky is a key export for Britain's drinks sector, with more than £5bn in annual exports. In recent years, China has been one of its fastest-growing markets.Industry groups welcomed the move, saying it would help Scottish distillers compete in a crowded market where US, European and Japanese firms are also vying for customers.Another outcome of the trip was visa-free travel for British citizens visiting China for up to 30 days for holidays and business, putting the UK on par with around 50 other countries, including France, Germany, Australia and Japan.Both sides also agreed to cooperate on disrupting migrant-smuggling networks, a top priority for Sir Keir's government. For Beijing, renewed ties with the UK - a major European economy and close US ally - signal that China remains a dependable partner for the West despite Trump's trade tensions.Economically, the reset secures access for Chinese exporters of high-value goods such as electric vehicles, solar panels and clean energy, while creating opportunities for Chinese investment in British services, finance and green tech.Chinese state media framed the visit as a step toward turning the \"potential of China–UK cooperation into real achievements that benefit both peoples and the world\".British firms were also quick to emphasise the benefits for both countries through the expanded partnerships.\"The prime minister's visit, the first in eight years, is a significant moment, signalling the importance of the economic relationship between the UK and China,\" Chris Fitzgerald, group director for international affairs at Octopus Energy told the BBC from China.\"Such partnerships mean we can bring affordable, secure, clean energy to British customers... And we can use our technology and know-how to bring some of the same benefits to Chinese customers.\"What challenges remain?Foreign businesses have long complained about the difficulties of doing business in China, flagging red tape, complex regulations, and a lack of transparency.These can complicate investment decisions and create uncertainty for companies.\"Any market has its own challenges, so of course we've got to be clear eyed and seek expert advice,\" Fitzgerald said.\"We have had good discussions with the Chinese officials who have welcomed our entry. And we have been careful to choose an excellent partner... So we are excited to take the immense opportunity that the world's largest renewable energy market offers.\"Sir Keir's Labour government has struggled to deliver the economic growth it promised, making the China visit a high-stakes test.Despite scrutiny at home, improving relations with the world's second-largest economy has been a priority for the British prime minister.The move, however, requires a delicate diplomatic balancing act.US President Trump recently warned that Canada could face 100% tariffs over deals struck with China during Mark Carney's visit, and he has warned the UK about deepening its commercial ties with Beijing.Sir Keir has insisted that Britain does not need to choose between Washington and Beijing, framing the reset as a pragmatic way to support growth at home while managing geopolitical risk.At the UK–China Business Forum in Beijing on Friday, he described meetings with Xi as \"very warm\" and highlighted the significance of agreements on visa-free travel and whisky tariffs.These offer British firms \"really important access\" and are \"symbolic of what we're doing with the relationship\", he said. \"That is the way that we build the mutual trust and respect that is so important.\"Sir Keir's visit is one of a flurry of trips to Beijing, as leaders from France, Canada and Finland seek to hedge against an increasingly unpredictable United States.With Washington pursuing aggressive tariff policies and even making threats over Greenland, these so-called middle powers are looking to diversify trade and investment partners while securing new markets.At the same time, these countries will be watching closely the deals that the UK, Canada, France and others are striking with China.They will all need to remain competitive in attracting Chinese investment and accessing the world's second largest economy.",

    "body": "6 hours agoMohammad Sartaj AlamBBC HindiMohammad Sartaj AlamEight of the 16 Indian crew members who were on board the tanker seized by IranThe families of 16 Indian seafarers held in Iran since December say they are anxious about the fate of their loved ones as the geopolitical situation in the region remains tense.On 8 December, Iranian authorities seized an oil tanker, MT Valiant Roar, while it was in international waters. They alleged that the ship, operated by Dubai-based Prime Tankers LLC, was carrying 6,000 metric tonnes of illegal diesel. The company has denied this. Apart from the 16 Indians, the crew has one person each from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.The Indian families of the crew members have approached the Delhi high court, asking it to issue urgent directions to the government to secure consular access and ensure their safe return.According to documents submitted by India's foreign ministry in a Delhi court, 10 of the Indian crew members have been arrested and moved to a jail in Iran while the others remain on board the ship. The ministry said it has now gained consular access to the 10 arrested men who are being held in Bandar Abbas prison. \"The Indian embassy has learned that the Iranian side will facilitate access to the six Indian seafarers on board the vessel once requisite clearances are received from the Iranian Navy/Prosecutor's office,\" it added.Relatives of the detained crew members allege they have been confined to a tiny room on the vessel without proper food or potable drinking water. While most of their laptops and phones have been taken away, one phone was returned, allowing them to have limited contact with their families, they said.The BBC has sent detailed questions to the Iranian embassy in Delhi about the allegations but has not received a response. Press Secretary Agha Mahdi Esfandiari said in a brief phone conversation that he had no information about Indian crew members being arrested or detained in Iran.The BBC has also sent questions to the high commissions of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in Delhi about the status of their citizens on the ship.While Iran had granted approval for consular access to the 10 arrested Indians on 10 January, this \"did not happen at that time, presumably, due to the prevailing situation in Iran\", according to the documents.The political situation in Iran has been turbulent over the past few weeks. Widespread protests broke out in the last week of December, initially triggered by anger against economic grievances and later expanding into calls for a regime change.Since then, there has been a significant build-up of US military forces in the region, raising speculation of a possible strike.Getty ImagesIran has seen widespread protests since the last week of DecemberJugwinder Brar, owner of Prime Tankers, told the BBC that the protests in Iran had prevented the company's lawyer from meeting the crew. He also denied the allegations by Iranian authorities, saying that the vessel was carrying Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO), a marine fuel used for refuelling the company's other ships in international waters. \"This is standard practice,\" he told the BBC.He alleged that Iran also seized another ship owned by Prime Tankers in December 2023 due to similar claims of carrying illegal fuel. Of its 21 crew members, 18 were released after nine months, but three remain imprisoned, he said.Brar insisted that both ships carried valid documents for VLSFO and the company's priority was to ensure the safe return of all crew members to India.Brar and his companies, including Prime Tankers, are subject to US sanctions, with the treasury department alleging that many of his vessels operate as \"part of Iran's shadow fleet\" to transport oil.When asked why the US sanctioned him, Brar said: \"America is an unchallenged country; no-one can question it. It can do whatever it wants.\"He also claimed that Iran may have seized his ship as they \"probably thought that the ship had an American or Israeli owner\".Domestic fuel prices in Iran are among the lowest in the world, mainly due to heavy government subsidies and authorities have said they routinely monitor maritime traffic around its waters to crack down on smuggling of fuel.Families and company officials of the seized ship allege that the crew are being held in a small room, where they also sleep at night.A relative of a detained crew member told the BBC on Thursday that food and fuel - which the Iranian navy last supplied nearly a week ago - are running low. The crew also does not have access to potable drinking water.Another concern, the person added, is that most of the ship's generators have stopped working. This has led to problems with the vessel's waste disposal and cleaning mechanisms, leading to blocked toilets and unsanitary living conditions, they added.The ship was seized weeks before many of the crew were due to complete their nine-month contracts in January.Masood Alam, one of the 10 arrested men, is set to get married after Eid, which falls in March. \"We had a short call with him on 5 January. Since then, we have had no information. He was already suffering from fever when detained,\" his father, Ibrar Ansari, told the BBC.Gayatri Singh, wife of chief officer Anil Kumar Singh, accused Iran of using the crew as \"human shields\".Cargo disputes, she said, should be settled with companies, not workers.\"The company decides the cargo, not the crew. Sending them to jail is inhuman,\" said Pradeep Singh, general secretary of the Sailors' Union of India.",

    "body": "Just nowMaia DaviesandImogen Foulkes,Geneva correspondentReutersAntónio Guterres said he could not \"overstate the urgency of the situation\"The United Nations is at risk of \"imminent financial collapse\" due to member states not paying their fees, the body's head has warned.António Guterres said the UN faced a financial crisis which was \"deepening, threatening programme delivery\", and that money could run out by July.He wrote in a letter to all 193 member states that they had to honour their mandatory payments or overhaul the organisation's financial rules to avoid collapse.It comes after the UN's largest contributor, the US, refused to contribute to its regular and peacekeeping budgets, and withdrew from several agencies it called a \"waste of taxpayer dollars\". Several other members are in arrears or are simply refusing to pay.Though the UN General Assembly did approve in late 2025 a partial change to its financial system, the organisation still faces a massive cash crisis. At its headquarters in Geneva, signs warning of the situation have been put up everywhere. In an almost desperate attempt to save cash, the escalators are regularly turned off and the heating turned down.Guterres wrote in his letter that the UN had faced financial crises in the past but that the current situation was \"categorically different\".\"Decisions not to honour assessed contributions that finance a significant share of the approved regular budget have now been formally announced,\" the secretary general said, without naming specific members.He said the \"integrity of the entire system\" depended on states adhering to their obligation under the UN charter to pay their \"assessed contributions\", adding that 2025 ended with a record amount unpaid - equivalent to 77% of the total owed.Guterres said a rule that the UN must return unspent money on particular programmes to members if it could not implement a budget created a \"double blow\" in which it was \"expected to give back cash that does not exist\".\"I cannot overstate the urgency of the situation we now face. We cannot execute budgets with uncollected funds, nor return funds we never received.\"As a result, the UN is now returning millions of dollars that it never actually received. The letter reads: \"Just this month, as part of the 2026 assessment, we were compelled to return $227m [£165m]  – funds we have not collected.\"\"The bottom line is clear,\" Guterres wrote. \"Either all member states honour their obligations to pay in full and on time – or member states must fundamentally overhaul our financial rules to prevent an imminent financial collapse.\"UN agencies rarely get all the money they ask for to tackle humanitarian crises, but the past 12 months have been particularly difficult. The US is the UN's largest contributor, but President Donald Trump has said it was not fulfilling its \"great potential\" and has criticised it for failing to support US-led peace efforts.The US did not pay its contribution to the UN's regular budget in 2025 and offered only 30% of its expected funding to UN peacekeeping operations.Other countries, such as the UK and Germany, have also announced significant reductions in foreign aid, which will inevitably impact the UN's work.Guterres had warned earlier that same month that the UN faced its most fragile financial position in years - again citing unpaid fees - having said in October that it faced a \"race to bankruptcy\".Trump has separately been accused by critics of seeking to replace some functions of the UN with his Board of Peace to oversee regeneration efforts in Gaza.The US president has said its work would happen \"in conjunction with the United Nations\" - but when previously asked by a Fox TV journalist whether the board would take the UN's place, he replied: \"Well, it might.\"The US officially left UN's World Health Organization last week. It had refused to pay its 2024 and 2025 dues despite, WHO lawyers say, being legally obliged to do so.Other agencies are also making huge cuts. The UN's human rights office has warned that serious violations will now go undocumented because it lacks the funds to deploy investigators. In the past, their evidence has led to prosecutions for war crimes and crimes against humanity.In Afghanistan, which has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the world, UN Women has had to close mother and baby clinics. Meanwhile, the World Food Programme has had to cut rations to refugees fleeing the conflict in Sudan.",

    "body": "1 hour agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterGetty ImagesGold prices have reached record highs recently, with investors piling money into the safe haven asset amid rising global political uncertainty.Silver has also rallied and is currently trading at around $98 per ounce, up from $35 per ounce a year ago.While the price of gold has fallen from recent highs, investors are still finding refuge in the precious metal.Trump uncertainty shifting investmentGlobal trade has been upset by tariffs introduced by US President Donald Trump on countries who wish to trade with the US but whom he sees as unfavourable.His trade policies continue to worry investors, helping to drive the gold rally, says Emma Wall, chief investment strategist at Hargreaves Lansdown.In January, gold and silver prices hit record highs, but share prices fell as investors reacted to Trump's threat of fresh tariffs on eight European countries opposed to his proposed takeover of Greenland.Hamad Hussain, an economist at Capital Economics, said the perception gold is a safe investment, in contrast with the risks associated with US foreign and fiscal policies under Trump, has put the previous metal \"in the spotlight\".War and Greenland threats add to uncertaintyWars in Ukraine and Gaza have added to a climate of general political uncertainty. The US seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro also pushed the gold price to blockbuster levels.Trump's Greenland threats heightened global political tensions and saw confidence in the US dollar plummet, with investors turning to precious metals as a safer investment. The biggest hit the dollar has faced during Trump's tenure was in the aftermath of his so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, announced last spring. \"Gold is doing what it does best when the world feels messy, jumping amid rising trade tensions, geopolitical flare-ups, political uncertainty in the US,\" Wall says.\"Fresh friction between the US, Canada and China, unease around Europe and the Middle East, and even shutdown risks in Washington have all added to gold's appeal.\"Central bank buyingCentral banks buying gold has been a key factor pushing up its price.\"Investors and global central banks have... favoured gold as their reserve currency of choice, which they believe insulates them from US policy dependence,\" says Wall.\"Certain nations will have observed the threat of Russia having its US dollar assets seized by global players supportive of Ukraine, and subsequently considered the metal a more attractive neutral reserve,\" she added.But while central banks are still buying more gold than before 2022, Hussain says, estimates suggest that demand actually softened in 2025.Other buyers of gold include China, which is the biggest buyer of gold, with demand in the country coming from individuals buying jewellery as well as investors.Investors in the west are also huge buyers of gold, with money flowing into firms on the stock market that own and trade gold.Hussein also says new buyers in the market have been picking up huge amounts of gold, adding to its dramatic rise recently. One example was Tether, a digital currency specialist which has recently purchased so much gold its reserves reportedly outsize those of some small countries.Why has the price of gold and silver fallen in recent days?Gold prices had been soaring to record highs in recent days, partly driven by fears Trump would choose a Fed chairman who would cave into his demands to cut interest rates, leading to a falling dollar and rising inflation. Buying gold is a strategy to protect against those things.But, as reports emerged the president would nominate Kevin Warsh, who is seen as a relatively safe bet compared with other candidates, the upward pressure on gold prices eased.The slump even saw gold fall below $5,000 an ounce at one stage on Friday.However, gold prices are still around 65% higher than this time last year because of ongoing geopolitical tensions, current tariffs and further tariff threats from Trump, and ongoing conflicts around the world. It means the shine of gold and silver feels more attractive than ever for investors seeking \"safe haven\" assets.One of gold's biggest appeals is its relative scarcity. Nicholas Frappell, global head of institutional markets at ABC Refinery, told the BBC: \"When you own gold, it's not attached to the debt of somebody else like a bond is or an equity where the performance of a company will drive performance.\"It's a really good diversifier in a very uncertain world.\"Friday's gold price volatility shows its value can fall almost as quickly as it rises, like all traded commodities.",

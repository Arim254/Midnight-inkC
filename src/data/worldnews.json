    "body": "Seven bodyguards have been arrested over their alleged involvement in the murder of a popular Mexican mayor, authorities have said.Carlos Manzo, the mayor of Uruapan and an outspoken critic of cartel violence, was shot dead on 1 November at a public event marking the Day of the Dead.The office of the attorney general of Michoacán state said in a brief statement that the public servants had been detained \"for their probable participation in the crime of aggravated homicide, in commission by omission\" in relation to Manzo's killing.It follows the arrest on Wednesday of a man police described as the mastermind behind the murder, who officials said had links to a powerful cartel.The attorney general's office in Michoacán, to the west of the capital, Mexico City, said the seven guards had been arrested by both state and federal officials, including the National Guard.Troops and agents led the suspects out of a municipal building on Friday near where Manzo had been killed, according to the Associated Press.The 40-year-old mayor was attending a Day of the Dead ceremony - which honours deceased family and friends - alongside his relatives when he was shot seven times, sending bystanders running for cover.Manzo's assassination triggered mass protests and questions have been raised about why his security detail failed to stop the lone gunman. The suspect was later restrained and shot by Manzo's bodyguards. Manzo had been outspoken about how avocado growers in the region were being extorted and threatened by criminal groups, and had also demanded that Mexico's federal government do more to rein in the cartels.The Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), which Mexico's security minister blamed for Manzo's slaying, engages in drug trafficking, as well as kidnapping for ransom and extortion.It is also infamous for targeting public officials who refuse to do its bidding.Mexican officials arrested the supposed mastermind of the assassination, named only by his forenames Jorge Amando, on Wednesday.While the CJNG is thought to be the most powerful of the criminal gangs operating in Michoacán, there are many others and their fights for control of drug, arms and fuel smuggling routes often result in deadly confrontations.",

    "body": "A grizzly bear is on the loose after attacking a school group in Canada, leaving 11 people injured, two of them critically.The incident happened on Thursday afternoon on a walking trail in the town of Bella Coola, in the province of British Columbia (BC). Residents have been warned to remain indoors while armed officers try to track down the animal. Four of the injured remained in hospital as of Friday afternoon, BC's Health Services Authority has said.A male teacher \"got the whole brunt of it\" and some children were hit with bear spray as the adults tried to fend off the animal, Veronica Schooner, a parent, told the Canadian Press.Ms Schooner said her 10-year-old son was part of the school group, though he was not attacked. \"He said that bear ran so close to him, but it was going after somebody else,\" she said, adding that \"he even felt its fur\".British Columbia Emergency Health Services told the BBC in a statement that two people were critically injured in the attack, two more were seriously hurt, while seven others were treated at the scene.Patients had to be transported to a nearby airport so they could be airlifted to the closest hospital, officials said. The group were from Acwsalcta School, which is run by the Indigenous Nuxalk Nation in the remote town 700km (435 miles) north-west of Vancouver. \"Officers are armed\" the Nation wrote on Facebook. \"Remain indoors and off the highway.\" It added: \"It's hard to know what to say during this very difficult time. We are so grateful for our team and our students.\" The Nation's officials have temporarily shut the school and are offering counselling services.",

    "body": "Unidentified drones have been observed hovering over a military base used by Nato in the Netherlands, the Dutch defence ministry has said. It said military personnel deployed weapons to try to take down the drones spotted near Volkel Air Base, north of Eindhoven, between 19:00 and 21:00 local time (18:00-20:00 GMT) on Friday.The defence ministry said the devices \"departed and were never recovered\".The Netherlands is among a number of northern European nations to be blighted by drone sightings around military installations and airfields in recent months. Russia has denied accusations it was involved in previous incidents.Dutch police are investigating Friday's incident. Officials said that for security reasons they would provide no further details about how the drones or what action was taken.As well as being used by the Royal Netherlands Air Force, Volkel Air Base hosts a US Air Force squadron as part of Nato.The incident follows reports of drone sightings at other Dutch air bases in the past few weeks, as well as facilities in neighbouring Belgium, Denmark and Germany.The sightings have disrupted air traffic and raised security concerns.A lack of evidence pointing to their origins has plagued investigations into the incidents since they began in September, as in many cases the drones depart after a while.Some European officials have attributed the sightings to \"hybrid warfare\" on the part of Russia, as the nations that have been targeted are all allied to Ukraine.But the Kremlin has denied it has anything to do with past incursions. Defence ministers from 10 EU countries have agreed to create a \"drone wall\" in response to the sightings, while some individual nations have sought to secure anti-drone defence measures.",

    "body": "1 day agoNadine YousifThe State of Missouri's Commission on Retirement, Removal and Discipline of JudgesJudge Thornhill of Missouri was disciplined for referencing Elvis Presley and dressing up as the singer in courtA Missouri court is all shook up following the resignation of a judge who was disciplined for wearing an Elvis Presley wig in court and occasionally playing the singer's songs during proceedings. Matthew EP Thornhill, the longest-serving circuit judge in St Charles County, is a self-described Elvis lover, according to his biography page. But his love for the King of Rock'n'Roll contributed to a disciplinary commission demanding his suspension, citing his frequent \"irrelevant\" Elvis references in court. In a letter explaining his actions, Judge Thornhill said his aim was \"to add levity at times when I thought it would help relax litigants\".\"I now recognise that this could affect the integrity and solemnity of the proceedings,\" Judge Thornhill wrote in a letter dated 12 November to the Missouri Supreme Court. The judge \"would routinely wear an Elvis Presley wig on or about October 31\" - or Halloween - in court while conducting court business, according to a report by Missouri's Commission on Retirement, Removal and Discipline of Judges, which investigates allegations of judicial misconduct.The report shows images of Judge Thornhill sitting on the bench while donning an Elvis wig with his signature black pompadour and sunglasses. It adds that, on occasion, he would give litigants or witnesses the option of being sworn in while playing Elvis music from his phone. He would also refer to the singer occasionally during court proceedings, including mentioning his date of birth or death and lyrics from his music, according to the inquiry report. St Charles County Circuit CourtJudge Matthew EP Thornhill is a self-described Elvis lover, according to his biography page.Judge Thornhill's burning love for all things Elvis is well-documented. In an interview with a local media outlet last year, he said he had visited Graceland, where the singer lived and is buried, 13 times. He added that Elvis was always on his mind since he was a child.The disciplinary report also cites unrelated conduct, like sharing his political affiliation or preferred candidates in elections from the bench, as well as promoting his own election campaign by asking witnesses, lawyers and litigants if they had seen his \"Thornhill for Judge\" signs around town. The commission found that Judge Thornhill had \"failed to maintain order and decorum in the courtroom\" and recommended he be suspended without pay for six months, then serve for another 18 months before retiring. In the 12 November letter, Judge Thornhill did not dispute any of the allegations, saying they were \"substantially accurate\". He acknowledged he had made a mistake and agreed to the terms set out by the commission, which allowed him to conclude his service on the bench and retire after 20 years. ",

    "body": "9 hours agoAlex Smith, Chris Ewokor,BBC Africa, in Abuja, and Elettra NeysmithBBCSt Mary's School, in Niger state, was attacked in the early hours of Friday morningMore than 300 children and staff are now thought to have been kidnapped by gunmen from a Catholic school in central Nigeria, making it one of the worst mass abductions the country has seen.The Christian Association of Nigeria said 303 students and 12 teachers were taken from on St Mary's School in Papiri, Niger state - substantially more than previously estimated.It said the figures have been revised upwards \"after a verification exercise\".The kidnapping comes amid a surge of attacks by armed groups. The revised number of people taken surpasses the 276 abducted during the infamous Chibok mass abduction of 2014.Local police said armed men stormed the school at around 02:00 local time (01:00 GMT) on Friday morning, abducting students who were staying there.Dominic Adamu, whose daughters attend the school but were not taken, told the BBC: \"Everybody is weak... it took everybody by surprise.\"One distressed woman tearfully told the BBC that her nieces, aged six and 13, had been kidnapped, adding: \"I just want them to come home.\"Police said that security agencies were \"combing the forests with a view to rescue the abducted students\".It was initially reported that 215 pupils had been taken - but that figure has since been revised upwards. The new number is believed to be almost half of the school's student population, the news agency AFP reports.Authorities in Niger state said the school had disregarded an order to close all boarding facilities following intelligence warnings of a heightened risk of attacks.They said in a statement the move exposed pupils and staff to \"avoidable risk\". The school has not commented on that claim.The kidnapping of people for ransom by criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, has become a major problem in many parts of Nigeria.The payment of ransoms has been outlawed in an attempt to cut the supply of money to the criminal gangs - but this has had little effect.Friday's mass abduction was the third such attack in the country in a week.On Monday, more than 20 schoolgirls, who the BBC has been told are Muslim, were kidnapped from a boarding school in neighbouring Kebbi state.A church was also attacked further south, in Kwara state, with two people killed and 38 others abducted.Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has postponed his foreign trips - including to this weekend's G20 summit in South Africa - in order to address the security concerns.The central government has ordered more than 40 federal colleges to close and public schools in some states have been shut.But the rising insecurity is fuelling anger as well as fear in Nigeria, with citizens demanding stronger action to protect children and communities.The mass abduction follows claims by right-wing figures in the US, including President Donald Trump, that Christians are being persecuted in Nigeria - an allegation dismissed by the Nigerian government.For months, campaigners and politicians in Washington have been alleging that Islamist militants are systematically targeting Christians in Nigeria.Earlier this month, Trump said he would send troops into Nigeria \"guns a-blazing\" if the African nation's government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".The Nigerian government has called claims that Christians are being persecuted \"a gross misrepresentation of reality\".An official said that \"terrorists attack all who reject their murderous ideology - Muslims, Christians and those of no faith alike\".In the north-east, jihadist groups have been battling the state for more than a decade.Organisations monitoring violence say most of the victims of these groups are Muslim because most attacks happen in the majority Muslim north of the country.In the centre of Nigeria, there are also frequently deadly attacks between herders - who are mostly Muslim - on farmers, who are largely Christian.However, analysts say these are often motivated by competition for resources, such as water or land, rather than religion.The militant Islamist group Boko Haram took 276 girls from their school in the town of Chibok 2014.The incident courted international attention and sparked a global campaign seeking their return, which included an intervention from then-US First Lady Michelle Obama.Many have since either escaped or been freed - but as many as 100 still remain missing.",

    "body": "Ukraine's allies from Europe, Canada and Japan have voiced concerns over a US plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war, saying it \"will require additional work\".They said in a statement the plan had elements \"essential for a just and lasting peace\", but cited concerns over border changes and caps on Ukraine's army.Later on Saturday, US President Donald Trump said the draft plan was not his \"final offer\" for Ukraine. On Sunday, security officials from Britain, France, Germany, the US and Ukraine will meet in Geneva, Switzerland.President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier warned Ukraine faced \"one of the most difficult moments in our history\" over US pressure to accept the plan seen as favourable to Moscow.Trump has given Ukraine until 27 November to accept the 28-point plan, while Russia's President Vladimir Putin said it could be the \"basis\" for a settlement.When asked on Saturday whether the current draft plan was his final offer for Ukraine, Trump told reporters at the White House: \"No, not my final offer.\" \"One way or another we have to get it [the war] ended, so we're working on it,\" he added.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff will be among those taking part in talks in Geneva on Sunday. National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell will attend on the UK's behalf.Saturday's joint statement at the G20 summit in South Africa was signed by the leaders of Canada, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, Germany and Norway. Two top EU officials were also among the signatories.The statement said: \"We believe therefore that the draft is a basis which will require additional work. We are ready to engage in order to ensure that a future peace is sustainable. We are clear on the principle that borders must not be changed by force.\"We are also concerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine's armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack.\"It added: \"The implementation of elements relating to the European Union and relating to Nato would need the consent of EU and Nato members respectively\".UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is at the G20 summit in Johannesburg, spoke to Zelensky on the phone on Saturday, followed by a call with Trump.On the Trump call, a Downing Street spokesman said Sir Keir \"relayed the discussions that have been taking place between Coalition of the Willing partners [Ukraine's allies] in attendance at the G20 summit today\".They added: \"The leaders agreed their teams would work together on the 28-point US peace proposal in Geneva tomorrow. They agreed to speak again tomorrow.\"Sir Keir earlier said he was concerned about proposed caps on Ukraine's military in the US plan, saying \"it's fundamental that Ukraine has to be able to defend itself if there's a ceasefire\".The widely leaked US peace plan proposes Ukrainian troops withdraw from the part of the eastern Donetsk region that they currently control, and de facto Russian control of Donetsk, as well as the neighbouring Luhansk region and the southern Crimea peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.The plan also includes freezing the borders of Ukraine's southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions along the current battle lines. Both regions are partially occupied by Russia.The US draft would also limit Ukraine's military to 600,000 personnel, with European fighter jets stationed in neighbouring Poland.Kyiv would receive \"reliable security guarantees\", the plan says, although no details have been given. The document says \"it is expected\" that Russia will not invade its neighbours and Nato will not expand further.The plan also suggests Russia will be \"reintegrated into the global economy\", through the lifting of sanctions and by inviting Russia to rejoin the G7 group of the world's most powerful countries - making it the G8 again.On Friday, Trump said Zelensky would \"have to like\" the US proposals, adding otherwise Ukraine and Russia would continue fighting.Earlier in the day, the Ukrainian leader addressed the nation with a stark warning that the country \"might face a very difficult choice: either losing dignity, or risk losing a key partner\". \"Today is one of the most difficult moments in our history,\" Zelensky added, pledging to work \"constructively\" with the Americans on the plan.On Saturday, Zelensky announced that his head of office Andriy Yermak would lead Ukraine's negotiating team for future talks on a peace deal, including any that may involve Russia.\"Our representatives know how to defend Ukraine's national interests and exactly what must be done to prevent Russia from launching a third invasion, another strike against Ukraine,\" the president said in a video statement posted on social media.Kyiv is critically dependent on deliveries of US-made advanced weaponry, including air defence systems to repel deadly Russian air assaults, as well as intelligence provided by Washington.Putin on Friday confirmed Moscow had received the US plan - but said it had not been discussed with the Kremlin in detail. He added Moscow was willing to \"show flexibility\" - but was also prepared to fight on.Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.In recent months, Russian troops have been slowly advancing in Ukraine's south-eastern region - despite reported heavy combat casualties.",

    "body": "8 hours agoKwasi Gyamfi Asiedu,in Washington, and Anthony Zurcher,North America correspondent, in WashingtonKey moments from Trump and Greene's public falloutMarjorie Taylor Greene has announced she will resign from office, an unexpected turn for the high-profile Republican.One of Donald Trump's Maga superstars and staunchest defenders, the Georgia congresswoman's relentless calls for releasing files related to late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and recent criticism of some of his policies led to a bitter public feud.After the US president labelled her a \"traitor\", she said in a video announcing her departure: \"I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and gets better.\"Trump, who had threatened to support a Republican challenger to unseat Greene, called her resignation \"great news for the country\" in an interview with ABC News.\"For some reason, primarily that I refused to return her never ending barrage of phone calls, Marjorie went BAD,\" he later wrote on Truth Social. \"Nevertheless, I will always appreciate Marjorie, and thank her for her service to our Country!\"Greene said in her video statement, posted on social media, that she would leave the US Congress on 5 January 2026.She said that she did \"not want my sweet district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the president we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms\". She had been one of the loudest demanding the release of documents related to Epstein, an issue that once united Trump and his base but has since become divisive.Trump had spent months arguing that the issue was a distraction concocted by his political detractors to divert attention from his administration's achievements.\"Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,\" Greene said in her resignation letter.Watch: Marjorie Taylor Greene announces resignation in video messageOver the last few months, she has gone on a number of high-profile news shows and was critical of Trump and fellow Republicans. She took issue with the president not doing enough to bring down living costs for voters and criticised his policy of introducing tariffs on imports. But above all, she criticised his administration for not releasing documents related to Epstein.Trump responded last week in a series of social media posts, calling Greene a \"traitor\" and \"wacky\". He said she should be unseated and vowed to back a challenger for her place in Congress.Days after their feud boiled over, with a growing number of Republicans calling for their release, Trump reversed course and said he would support their publication. He signed a bill this week that forces the US Justice Department to release the documents within 30 days. Greene was elected to Congress in 2020 amid a backdrop of headlines over her support and promotion of QAnon conspiracies, including claiming school shootings and the 9/11 terror attacks were staged. She has since apologised and sought to distance herself from those comments.In the video announcing her resignation, Greene ticked off a list of political achievements. She noted in her resignation letter that the comments from Trump were \"hurtful\". AFP via Getty ImagesGreene and Trump on the campaign trail in 2024While she announced her departure from the House of Representatives, US media reports have indicated Greene has shown an interest in running for state office - either as Georgia governor or for a Senate seat. The president has commented publicly about those ambitions, writing on Truth Social during their public feud that he had previously told her that she shouldn't run for either of those offices due to poor public polling. Greene has since said she did not plan to run for either of those offices. Before their public falling out, Trump and Greene had been close allies in championing the \"America First\" agenda. She joined him on the campaign trail and was one of the Republicans most vocal about Trump's false claims that he'd won the 2020 presidential election against Joe Biden. Her departure will further close the gap in the Republican-led House of Representatives, where the party only holds a handful of seats more than Democrats. Control of the chamber will be up for grabs in the 2026 midterm elections next November. ",

    "body": "'I'll be cheering for him': Takeaways from Trump and Mamdani's surprisingly cordial meeting16 hours agoKayla EpsteinWatch: \"I’ll be cheering for him\" - Trump praises Mamdani after first meetingUS President Donald Trump met New York City's newly elected mayor Zohran Mamdani at the White House in what was billed as the political showdown of the year - but instead became a praise fest. In his election victory speech, the self-described Democratic socialist mayor called Trump a \"despot\".  And before Friday's meeting, the president's spokeswoman had billed Mamdani's visit as a \"communist coming to the White House\". But standing side-by-side in the Oval Office, the two men struck a surprisingly conciliatory tone.Over and over, both men emphasised their shared interest in addressing New York City's affordability crisis. They smiled often, and Trump even appeared amused as reporters asked him about the political attacks Mamdani had fired his way.The tone of the meeting appeared to strike political observers off-guard, but offered a signal that both men understand that tackling the affordability crisis is critical to their political success.Whether the truce will last once Mamdani takes office on 1 January remains to be seen.Until then, \"I'll be cheering for him,\" Trump said.Trump full of praiseThe rapport was evident from the moment they started speaking to the press. Facing the media after a private meeting, Mamdani stood to Trump's right with his hands clasped, as the president sat behind the Resolute Desk. Their body language was relaxed – particularly Trump's.Not only did Trump refrain from attacking Mamdani, he praised him numerous times.The president expressed hope that Mamdani would be a \"really great mayor\". Later, the president added he was \"confident that he can do a very good job\". Brushing off questions about jihad and fascismGetty ImagesBoth men were all smiles at the meeting Mamdani and Trump traded political barbs throughout the mayoral election. A reporter in the room on Friday reminded the two men that Trump had called Mamdani a \"communist\" and Mamdani had referred to the president as a \"despot\". Both men deflected multiple questions about their previous statements and pivoted back to praise.Trump even let Mamdani answer a question about whether the mayor-elect thought the president was a \"fascist\". \"That's ok, you can just say yes,\" Trump interjected, giving Mamdani a light tap on the arm and smiling. \"It's easier than explaining.\"The closest Trump came to criticising Mamdani's politics was telling reporters: \"He's got views that are little out there.\"Perhaps most striking, Trump dismissed a question echoing an attack on Mamdani by one of Trump's top political allies in New York.\"Do you think you're standing next to a 'jihadist' right now in the oval office?\" a reporter asked, quoting Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, who is mounting a run for governor of New York state.\"No I don't,\" Trump quickly replied.\"You say things sometimes in a campaign,\" Trump said of Stefanik. \"She's a very capable person.\"Bonding over New York rootsGetty ImagesMamdani and Trump have something in common: they're both New Yorkers, and both have called the borough of Queens home.Trump's childhood home is in the neighbourhood of Jamaica Estates, while Mamdani currently resides in Astoria.The two had a \"shared admiration and love\" of the city, Mamdani said.Though Trump rarely spends time in his namesake Manhattan skyscraper these days, he spoke fondly of his hometown throughout the news conference.\"This city could be unbelievable - if he could be a spectacular success, I'll be very happy,\" Trump said.At one point, the president suggested that, in a different political lifetime, he would have liked to be mayor of New York himself.Affordability focusPerhaps part of the reason the two men appeared in lock-step on Friday was their shared focus on cost-of-living issues.Trump won re-election last year after relentlessly hammering the issue of high inflation that had frustrated voters in 2024. As consumers grow restless about the cost of groceries, housing and other essentials, Trump has tried to convey a message of economic stability.During his election campaign in New York City, Mamdani maintained a laser focus on the lack of affordable housing and proposed freezing rent increases on certain rent-stabilised apartments, among other initiatives.Mamdani said he and Trump discussed how to \"deliver affordability to New Yorkers\".Whenever he was asked a question about their differing views, the mayor-elect brought the conversation back to this topic.Facing one question about their different views on achieving peace in the Middle East, Mamdani responded that Trump voters had expressed to him a wish for \"an end to forever wars\" and for leaders to address \"the cost-of-living crisis\".On law enforcement and immigration, they also appeared to find some common ground. Mamdani said he and Trump discussed federal immigration-enforcement operations in New York, and he relayed concerns from residents about how they are being conducted.But Trump said they discussed crime more than immigration.\"He doesn't want to see crime and I don't want to see crime,\" the president said. He had \"very little doubt\" the two wouldn't get along on that issue.Trump even said he would feel safe living in a Mamdani-led New York.A complication for Republicans' strategy? The cordial relations on display on Friday may complicate efforts by Republicans to use the self-described democratic socialist as a bogeyman in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections, when control of the US Congress will be up for grabs.In elections earlier this month, Republicans struggled and Democrats won key races. It's unclear whether that trend will hold. Republicans had plans in place to make Mamdani the face of the Democratic Party, according to US news site Axios. They included painting him as anti-police, anti-capitalism and anti-Israel in an effort to give Republicans a leg-up in key races. But the Oval Office chuminess could undercut that strategy.While praising Mamdani, the president said he believed the new mayor would \"surprise some conservative people\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoSofia Ferreira Santos and Alex SmithReuters/Adriano MachadoJair Bolsonaro has been taken into custody after being determined a \"concrete flight risk\" while under house arrest.The former Brazilian president was found guilty of plotting a military coup in September and sentenced to more than 27 years in prison, but he remains under house arrest pending appeals.Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes said the move to detain the 70-year-old was a preventative measure after \"new facts\" came to light.This included attempting to break his ankle monitor and a call for a public vigil that could \"allow for a possible escape\".In a filing authorising the arrest, Justice Moraes said information from the centre monitoring Bolsonaro's house arrest suggested the former president's \"intention to break the electronic ankle bracelet to ensure success in his escape\".This, it said, would be \"facilitated by the confusion caused by the demonstration called by his son\".His son, Flávio, who serves a senator, called for a gathering of his supporters near Bolsonaro's home to take place on Saturday night. Flávio Bolsonaro wrote on social media on Friday: \"Are you going to fight for your country, or watch it all from your phone there on your sofa? I invite you to fight with us.\"He said the vigil would be so supporters could \"pray for his health and for the return of democracy in our country\".Part of Justice Moraes's decision was the possibility of Bolsonaro's \"relocation to embassies near the residence, considering that the investigations revealed a history of planning to request asylum through a diplomatic representation\", a statement said.The court filing highlights that the US embassy in the capital, Brasilia, is located around 13km (8 miles) from Bolsonaro's home.Bolsonaro's legal woes have drawn the ire of fellow right-wing populist US President Donald Trump, prompting him to impose a 50% tariff on imports of Brazilian goods.Bolsonaro is being held in a Federal Police station in Brasilia and will undergo a custody hearing on Sunday.It was only on Friday that the former president's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to allow him to serve his whole jail sentence under house arrest, with electronic monitoring.They also asked that Bolsonaro be allowed to leave his home for medical treatment, saying he required regular treatment for pulmonary infections and other ailments.Bolsonaro was found guilty of leading a conspiracy aimed at keeping him in power after he lost the 2022 election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.Supreme Court justices said that he knew of a plot which included plans to assassinate Lula and his vice-presidential running mate, Geraldo Alckmin, and to arrest and execute Alexandre de Moraes - the Supreme Court justice who has been overseeing Bolsonaro's trial.The conspiracy was thwarted because it failed to get the backing of the army and air force commanders. Lula was sworn in without incident on 1 January 2023.But a week later, on 8 January, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters stormed and vandalised government buildings in the capital, Brasília.The security forces intervened and around 1,500 people were arrested.The justices found that the rioters had been incited by Bolsonaro whose plan, they said, was for the Brazilian military to intervene, restore order and bring him back to power.At the time, Bolsonaro's lawyers called the 27 years and three months sentence \"absurdly excessive\".He was also barred from running for public office until 2060 - eight years after the end of his sentence.The former president called the trial a \"witch hunt\" and said it was designed to prevent him running in the 2026 presidential election.",

    "body": "Just nowLeyla KhodabakhshiEPAA woman lights a candle at a church in TehranOne Monday in mid-October, after a year in US immigration detention, officers arrived unannounced at Majid's cell in Texas.They told him simply to \"pack up\" - that he was being moved - even though an immigration judge had already granted him protection from removal five months ago. Shackled at the wrists, waist and ankles, he was driven through the night to a military airfield in Louisiana.Majid - not his real name - had fled Iran for the US in October 2024, after repeated detentions and alleged torture, first because of his involvement in the Mahsa Amini protests, and later because of his conversion to Christianity.When US officials forced him to board a plane carrying more than 150 deportees heading to Managua, Nicaragua, he remembers being the only non–Latin American on the plane. Hours later, the flight landed and officials handcuffed him, denied his request for asylum and directed him onto an itinerary routing him through Venezuela and Turkey toward Iran - a journey he understood as a forced return.Majid later was able to go into hiding in Istanbul, terrified of what awaited him back in Iran. He is one of several Iranian Christian converts who spoke to the BBC - most anonymously out of fear for relatives back home - whose asylum claims have been rejected in the past year. Their accounts point to inconsistencies in how US authorities assess the risks facing Iranian returnees and how sensitive religious information in asylum files is handled.Their experiences also run contrast to other elements of US foreign policy, as President Trump publicly laments the plight of Christian persecutions abroad, threatening to send troops into Nigeria \"guns a-blazing\" if its government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".A White House official told the BBC that all individuals deported have had their asylum claims fully adjudicated before removal. The official said that recent deportations to Iran involved people with final orders of removal or those who had requested voluntary departure. They added that strict confidentiality rules prevent officials from disclosing whether someone applied for asylum and was denied.'Chaos is over' - quiet streets at border after Trump crackdownAre Christians being persecuted in Nigeria as Trump claims?A rare deportation flightAs the US continues its crackdown on illegal immigration, which was a central plank of Trump's winning re-election campaign, it has made unprecedented changes to its policy towards Iranian asylum seekers. In late September, authorities arranged a chartered flight to Iran via Qatar - the first of its kind in decades, given the absence of diplomatic ties and Iran's human-rights record. The flight represented an unusual example of cooperation between Iran and the US.Dozens of Iranians were placed on the flight, reportedly in shackles. One deportee, Sina, later described armed guards escorting passengers on the Qatar–Tehran leg. On arrival, they were questioned about their time in the US and their religious activities but were not immediately arrested, he said in a video, which was posted on a Farsi-language YouTube channel.Among the passengers was the wife of Ali, an Iranian Christian convert now living in the US. She has since been contacted and summoned by Iranian intelligence.\"They deported my wife back to Iran even though she is a Christian,\" Ali says - the BBC has given him a pseudonym to protect the identity of him and his wife. \"Now Iranian intelligence is after her and me.\"For Ali's wife and others, the danger was heightened by what their lawyers say was a critical mistake.Attorney Ali Herischi, who represents Ali, his wife, and another deportee from the September flight says several clients reported that sensitive information - including statements about religious conversion, political activity and the reasons they sought asylum - was not removed before deportation.US deporting 120 Iranians after deal struck with Tehran, Iran saysDetained in immigration raids, Maga mom still has faith in Trump's mass deportation planGetty ImagesPastor Ara Torosian says Iranian Christians fear what will happen to them if deported back to IranWhy returning is dangerous for Christian convertsConverts from Islam make up a significant share of Iran's estimated 800,000 Christian population, says Steve Dew-Jones of Article 18, a UK-based advocacy group that monitors violations against Christians in the country.With officially recognised churches tightly restricted, house churches have begun to emerge across the country. But practitioners continue to face persecution, Dew-Jones says.Converting from Islam is treated as apostasy, and converts face arrest, interrogation and prison terms.Iran: The Christians celebrating Easter in secretArrests have increased sixfold between 2023 and 2024, the Center for Human Rights in Iran reports. \"Since the recent Iran–Israel clashes, we've seen the authorities use the term 'Zionist Christianity' even more aggressively. By branding converts as agents of Israel, the state frames ordinary religious practice as a national-security threat,\" Dew-Jones adds.Some Iranians seeking asylum abroad cite conversion as part of their claim, while Iranian officials accuse them of exaggerating or fabricating conversions to strengthen their cases.But it is unclear how many US asylum cases may be exaggerated, versus real fear of persecution.\"It's impossible to judge the sincerity of someone's faith - there's no window into people's souls,\" Dew-Jones says. \"Yes, the system can be abused, but we also see many legitimate converts whose testimonies and church records aren't taken seriously by asylum courts.\"Life on hold for those left behindAsylum outcomes can diverge sharply even within a single household, Iranian asylum seekers and legal experts say.In late June, ICE officers arrived at Marjan and Reza's house in Los Angeles. In video filmed by their pastor, Marjan is seen collapsed outside as agents detain her husband. Moments earlier she had called him pleading for help. The couple - both Christian converts from Iran who had applied for asylum in the US - were taken to separate detention centres. Weeks later, their cases diverged: Marjan was granted asylum in California, while Reza, held in New Mexico, was ordered to be removed to a third country.After their June arrest, the Department of Homeland Security said on its X account that \"during a targeted enforcement operation in Los Angeles, Border Patrol agent apprehended two Iranian nationals unlawfully present in the US - both flagged as subjects of national security interest.\"Submitted photoA screenshot of the video filmed by Pastor Ara, showing Reza and Marjan being detained by immigration enforcementPastor Ara Torosian, who filmed their arrest, disputes the Department of Homeland Security's claim that the couple were unlawfully present in the US.He says they entered legally through a humanitarian programme and had work authorisations. \"How can it be dangerous for the wife but not for the husband?\" asks pastor, Ara Torosian, who himself fled Iran in 2010 after being detained for smuggling Bibles.Majid, who managed to slip through the airport in Turkey, has been living in limbo since, while his lawyer follows up on his case. His wife, whose asylum case is still pending, now lives in Los Angeles with their 1.5-year-old daughter - a child who has never met her father.In the US, Ali is living with a friend from his church, and hoping his own asylum claim will be more successful than that of his wife, who was deported to Iran this year.\"If they grant me asylum, how can I stay here when my wife is in Iran? If they deport me, I could go to prison the moment I land.\"Unable to work legally or open a bank account. He first stayed with a distant relative \"just until my wife's case was resolved,\" but she was never released and, after nearly a year in detention, was deported. A small church later offered him temporary shelter.\"Anytime they ask me to leave, I have to sleep in parks,\" he says.He is awaiting an immigration hearing but sees no good outcome. His wife has received another summons from Iranian intelligence.\"If they arrest her and demand I return,\" he says quietly, \"I'll have no choice.\"",

    "body": "2 days agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor and BBC MonitoringBloomberg via Getty ImagesKirill Dmitriev has played a prominent role in Russia's return from diplomatic isolation in 2025Kirill Dmitriev is a rare breed of Russian diplomat.At 50 he is relatively young and he has a deep understanding of the US, having studied and worked there for several years.He is also a man of commerce, as head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, and a good fit for his opposite number in the Trump administration, special envoy Steve Witkoff.Dmitriev now finds himself under the spotlight over a draft peace plan that emerged after he spent three days with Witkoff in Miami.His team has refused to comment on its proposals, which read like a Putin wishlist, requiring Ukraine to cede territory under its control and slash the size of its military.Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky has been careful not to reject its terms, but says any deal must bring a \"dignified peace, with terms that respect our independence, our sovereignty\".  VYACHESLAV PROKOFYEV/POOL/AFPWitkoff (R) and Dmitriev have struck up a close diplomatic rapportPutin's special envoy understands modern Ukraine better than most in Moscow. He was brought up in Ukraine, and a friend claims that as a 15-year-old Dmitriev took part in pro-democracy protests in Kyiv before the fall of the Soviet Union.He has been a fixture of US-Russian diplomatic initiatives pretty much since the start of Trump's second presidency - and Steve Witkoff has been a regular counterpart.\"We are sure we are on the road to peace, and as peacemakers we need to make it happen,\" Dmitriev told a conference in Saudi Arabia in late October.The pair appear to have first crossed paths in February 2025 when Putin's envoy played a role in securing the release of an American teacher from a Russian jail.\"There's a gentleman from Russia, his name is Kirill, and he had a lot to do with this. He was important. He was an important interlocutor bridging the two sides,\" Witkoff told reporters.Days later, when US and Russian diplomats met in Saudi Arabia, in effect bringing an end to Russia's diplomatic isolation in the West, Dmitriev took part in talks on economic relations and Witkoff was there too.Dmitriev's direct approach to Trump officials has not always paid off. When Trump announced sanctions on Russia's top two oil firms last month, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent labelled him a \"Russian propagandist\" for suggesting it would mean higher US fuel prices at the pump.Unlike the majority of Putin's entourage, the Russian leader's envoy is comfortable in a US TV studio. He is careful to praise Trump's diplomatic skills while giving Western viewers the Russian government narrative in their own language.\"I'm not a military guy… but the position of [the] Russian military is they only hit military targets,\" he told CNN's Jake Tapper recently, days after a kindergarten was bombed in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. \"I'm just working to have dialogue and make sure that the conflict is ended as soon as possible.\"Dmitriev certainly is not a military guy, he's a private investment specialist with an eye for a deal.Getty ImagesWhen Putin travelled to the UAE in August, Dmitriev was there in the backgroundWitkoff may rate him, but in 2022 during Joe Biden's presidency, the US Treasury called him a \"known Putin ally\"  and imposed sanctions on the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) which he has run since 2011.\"While officially a sovereign wealth fund, RDIF is widely considered a slush fund for President Vladimir Putin and is emblematic of Russia's broader kleptocracy,\" it said.Dmitriev's attitude to the Biden years is pretty clear: under Biden there was no attempt to understand the Russian position, he argues, while Trump's team stopped World War Three.OLGA MALTSEVA/AFPDmitriev's wife is a friend of Katerina Tikhonova, a daughter of Vladimir PutinIt is claimed that Dmitriev has accumulated a real estate fortune with his wife, TV presenter Natalia Popova.Popova is a friend and colleague of Vladimir Putin's daughter, Katerina Tikhonova - and deputy head of Tikhonova's tech firm Innopraktika. Dmitriev is also widely seen as part of Tikhonova's circle.His rise to the top in Moscow is a far cry from his childhood in Kyiv, as the son of two scientists. Dmitriev's father is a well known cell biologist in Ukraine and his mother a geneticist.That scientific background may have influenced his move to use his Russian sovereign wealth fund to finance Russia's Covid vaccine Sputnik V.Dmitriev is believed to have first met Russia's long-time leader at the start of his presidency in 2000, but he has not always agreed with his views.While Putin saw the collapse of the Soviet Union as the \"biggest geopolitical catastrophe of the century\", a friend claims Dmitriev joined an anti-Soviet student protest in Kyiv at the age of 15.His relationship with the US began the same year, in 1990, when he took part in a student exchange programme in New Hampshire, where a local newspaper quoted him highlighting Ukraine's national identity: \"Ukraine had a long history as an independent nation before it became part of the Russian empire.\"He later returned to the US as a college student and wrote a thesis on privatisation in Ukraine while at Stanford University. In his thesis proposal he suggested the research would \"prepare me better for making a contribution to the reform process in Ukraine\".After earning an MBA at Harvard, he worked for McKinsey in Los Angeles, Prague and Moscow, and then joined the US-Russia Investment Fund, set up by the US to ease Russia's transition to a market economy.Dmitriev appeared critical of Putin's crackdown on Russia's oligarchs in 2003 in a column for the Vedomosti business paper. \"The world is shrewd enough to know the difference between following the letter of the law and using the law as a tool of influence,\" he wrote.By 2007 he was back in Ukraine, in charge of Icon Private Equity, an investment fund with offices in Kyiv and Moscow.Increasingly he lamented Ukraine's political \"instability\" and suggested Russia was better placed to respond to the global financial crisis.He was a regular guest on TV talk shows and in 2010 he warned Ukraine would face an \"economic Holodomor\"  if it pursued a policy of isolation from Russia: a reference to the Ukrainian famine of the1930s brought on by the policies of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.In 2011 he moved back to Russia to take charge of the newly-launched Russian Direct Investment Fund and remains there to this day.His overtures to the Trump administration have not come out of the blue.The Mueller report into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia during the 2016 US presidential election refers to Dmitriev meeting campaign supporters after the vote. But it was from February 2025 that contacts with the US were stepped up.Much of his work has been on diplomacy, but he has always had an eye on commercial opportunity. He proposed joint energy projects in the Arctic, and suggested partnering Russia's sovereign wealth fund with US companies in developing rare earth deposits.He has also spoken of Russia offering Elon Musk \"a small-sized nuclear power plant for a mission to Mars\" and even an $8bn (£6bn) \"Putin-Trump\" rail tunnel linking their two countries beneath the Bering Strait.Dmitriev's stock may be rising in Russia, but his reputation has taken a dive in Ukraine, where sanctions have been imposed on him for alleged crimes against Ukraine and Ukrainians.",

    "body": "1 day agoSteve RosenbergRussia editorEPAIt was quite a contrast.On Thursday, a US Pentagon delegation was in Kyiv. They were talking to President Zelensky about a draft plan to end the war in Ukraine.The same day, on Russian state TV, President Putin was in military fatigues. He was talking to his army chiefs about fighting on.\"We have our tasks, our goals,\" the Kremlin leader declared. \"The chief one is the unconditional achievement of the aims of the special military operation.\"The Izvestia newspaper called President Putin's visit to a command post \"a signal to America that he's prepared to negotiate on Ukraine, on Russia's terms\".Which brings us back to the peace plan.On Friday night, President Putin said he had seen the US settlement plan for Ukraine.Addressing a meeting of the Russian security council in Moscow, he described the American proposals as a \"modernised\" version of the plan discussed with Trump at the Alaska summit between the leaders in August.President Putin said he thought the plans could form the basis of final peace settlement.The 28-point proposal, which has been widely leaked and reported on, appeared after a visit to America by President Putin's envoy Kirill Dmitriev. He took part in three days of discussions in Miami with President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff.According to drafts of the peace proposal, Ukraine would cede to Russia parts of the Donbass still under Kyiv's control; the Ukrainian armed forces would be reduced in size and Ukraine would vow not to join Nato.\"The Russian military's effective work should convince Zelensky and his regime that it's better to strike a deal and do it now,\" President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov previously told journalists on a Kremlin conference call.A peace proposal does not automatically mean peace. What if there's no agreement?Pro-Kremlin commentators insist that, deal or no deal, Russia will prevail.\"Everyone thought that the idea of a peace deal had sunk in a swamp,\" wrote Russian news outlet Moskovsky Komsomolets. \"But suddenly, a rocket has shot out of this bog with a new, or rather an 'old new' peace plan, with something of the Alaska summit about it. It shot out like a jack in the box.\"How long and how far will this missile fly? Will it crash, sabotaged by Europe and Kyiv? Even if the launch is a false start, it's unlikely to change the general trend. The balance of power is shifting in Russia's favour.\"But after nearly four years of war Russia is under pressure, too. Since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, not only has Russian's army suffered huge losses on the battlefield, but back home the economy is faltering. Russia's budget deficit is growing, revenues from oil and gas falling.\"Russia's industry is somewhere between stagnation and decline,\" declared the broadsheet Nezavisimaya Gazeta this week.It's unclear, though, whether economic pressures will change President Putin's calculations and convince him that now is the moment to end his so-called special operation: even on terms that many believe benefit Moscow.Many. But not everyone.Some elements of the peace plan haven't gone down well in Russia. Some reports suggest that Ukraine could be offered security guarantees modelled on Nato's Article 5. That might commit Western allies to treat any future Russian attack on Ukraine as an attack on the transatlantic community as a whole and trigger a combined military response.\"This is, in effect, Ukraine in Nato,\" wrote Moskovsky Komsomolets, \"only without the deployment of bases and weapons on its territory.\"The full details of the peace plan have yet to be confirmed. We may be entering another period of intense diplomacy.For now, though, Russia's war on Ukraine continues.",

    "body": "8 hours agoHelen LivingstoneSydneyGettySussan Ley has been deposed by Angus Taylor (back centre) as leader of Australia's Liberal party The first female leader of Australia's Liberal Party, Sussan Ley, has been ousted after just nine months in the job, losing a leadership ballot to her former shadow defence minister Angus Taylor.Ley was elevated to the role after the party suffered a resounding defeat in last year's election, but since then has been plagued by poor poll numbers and infighting among the conservative Liberal-National Coalition.Taylor had announced he would challenge her for leadership of the opposition on Wednesday, ending months of speculation.In a social media post he said his election on Friday was \"an immense honour\" and that he looked forward to working with new deputy leader Jane Hume.Taylor, from the party's conservative faction, won the secret ballot, 34 votes to 17.Shortly after the results were announced, Ley said that she would resign as an MP and step away \"completely and comprehensively from public life\".She told waiting reporters she harboured \"no hard feelings\" towards the new leader although, in an apparent jab at the infighting she has endured, she added that it was important he get \"clear air, something that is not always afforded to leaders\".  Taylor, who narrowly lost the 2025 leadership contest to Ley, is a former management consultant who first entered parliament in 2013. He served as a minister under Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison.Ley's position had never seemed secure. The Liberal-National coalition, a partnership dating back to the 1940s, twice split under her leadership, the first time immediately after the May election and the second time just weeks ago.A series of recent polls have also shown the populist One Nation Party - which only got 6% of the national vote last year - overtaking the Coalition to take second place behind Labor. Ley's personal ratings have also been poor.The coalition has largely failed to agree on what caused its crushing election defeat to Labor, which saw the Liberals all but wiped out in the major cities, with disagreements on energy and climate policy in a particular.Reflecting on her time at the helm, Ley said it had been \"very tough\" at times but added: \"I was part of the early punk rock movement in Canberra, I will continue to find wisdom in one of punk's defining themes, a fearless and honest belief in yourself.\"",

Over his head are the Olympic rings. Underneath him is the Brandenburg Gate and the words \"Germany Berlin 1936 Olympic Games\".\"The 1936 Olympic Games were a central propaganda tool of the Nazi regime,\" Klara Schedlich, spokesperson for sports policy for the Green Party faction in the Berlin House of Representatives, told the German press agency, DPA.She accused the IOC of \"clearly not reflecting sufficiently on its own history\" and said \"the choice of image is problematic and unsuitable for a T-shirt\", without context.The IOC told the BBC that while it \"of course acknowledge[s] the historical issues of Nazi propaganda\" it wanted to also remember that the Berlin 1936 Games saw \"4,483 athletes from 49 countries compete in 149 medal events\". \"We made an Olympic Heritage Collection available to the public that celebrates 130 years of Olympic art and design. For this series, emblems, pictograms, posters and mascots from all editions of the Olympic Games are featured,\" a spokesperson said.\"Many of them stunned the world with their athletic achievements, including Jesse Owens.\"Jesse Owens, an African-American track and field athlete, won four gold medals at the 1936 Games, crushing the Nazi myth of Aryan racial supremacy.The spokesperson said that the historical context of the Berlin Games was explained at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, and that only a limited number of 1936 T-Shirts had been produced and sold.",

    "body": "6 hours agoToby MannGetty ImagesJapanese authorities say they have seized a Chinese fishing vessel that tried to flee when ordered to stop for an inspection, in a move that may further fuel tensions with Beijing.The boat was in Japan's exclusive economic zone off Nagasaki Prefecture in the south-west when it was intercepted and its captain arrested on Thursday, according to the country's fisheries agency.\"The vessel's captain was ordered to stop for an inspection by a fisheries inspector, but the vessel failed to comply and fled,\" the fisheries agency said.The seizure is the first time since 2022 that the agency has seized a Chinese fishing boat. China has yet to react to Japan's statement. There were 11 people aboard, including the captain who is a 47-year-old Chinese national, the fisheries agency said. Authorities and Japanese media have described the seized vessel as a \"tiger net fishing boat\" with a high capacity.\"We will continue to take resolute action in our enforcement activities to prevent and deter illegal fishing operations by foreign vessels,\" Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said on Friday.Thursday's incident comes amid strained relations after Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi enraged China in November by suggesting Tokyo would intervene militarily if Beijing sought to take Taiwan by force.China has long insisted that Taiwan, occupied for decades by Japan until 1945, is its territory.It has not ruled out using force to achieve what it calls \"reunification\".In response to Takaichi's remarks, which China's foreign ministry described as \"egregious\", Beijing summoned Tokyo's ambassador and warned its citizens to reconsider travel and study in Japan.That led to a sharp drop in visits to Japan by Chinese tourists, and a subsequent hit to Japanese stocks related to tourism and retail.As the diplomatic spat deepened during the end of 2025, Beijing repeatedly demanded that Takaichi retract her comments, and its foreign ministry warned Japan to \"stop playing with fire\".Japanese artists touring China have also had shows cancelled and releases of popular Japanese movies have been postponed.",

    "body": "16 hours agoAlicia CurryNurPhoto via Getty ImagesThorbjørn Jagland's lawyer has previously said he denies criminal liability and is willing to cooperateFormer Norwegian Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland has been charged with \"gross corruption\" over his ties with the US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, police have said.The charge was brought after the Council of Europe lifted Jagland's immunity, which he enjoyed because of his past diplomatic role. He denies criminal liability and is willing to cooperate, his lawyer says.Emails released by the US government are thought to show that Jagland planned solo and family visits to Epstein's homes in Paris, New York and Palm Beach after the billionaire was convicted of a child sex offence.Three of Jagland's properties were searched by Norwegian crime unit Økokrim and he is now expected to be questioned.As well as serving as prime minister from 1996 to 1997, Jagland is also a former head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee and spent a decade as secretary general of the Council of Europe.Jagland had diplomatic immunity from heading the Council, Europe's watchdog for democracy and human rights, for alleged acts carried out during his 2009 to 2019 tenure.The so-called Epstein files appear to show instances where the late financier covered the travel expenses to his properties for Jagland and his family.The former leader had planned a family trip to Epstein's private Caribbean island in 2014, but it was ultimately cancelled after Epstein fell ill. Jagland also faces allegations that he solicited Epstein's help in obtaining a bank loan in another exchange, although it is not clear whether this materialised, according to Norwegian broadcaster NRK. Police have not confirmed whether this allegation is part of the gross corruption charge.Mention in the Epstein files - which have been released by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) - does not indicate any wrongdoing. Jagland was seen walking out of his home alongside his lawyer in Oslo on Thursday, one of the properties - alongside two in Risør and Rauland - that Økokrim confirmed it had searched. Politicians, celebrities and royals have been caught up in the turmoil after the US DOJ published the latest tranche of files last month, containing millions of private emails, images and FBI reports into the late sex offender - who died in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking. The Nordic country has seen several public figures drawn into the widening scandal, including Crown Princess Mette-Marit, diplomats Mona Juul and Terje Rød-Larsen, and chief executive of the World Economic Forum (WEF), Borge Brende.Juul's lawyer has said she \"does not recognise the accusations made against her\" and Rød-Larsen's lawyer said he is confident the investigation will clarify \"there is no basis for criminal liability\".The WEF ordered an independent review into Brende - who also served as the Norwegian foreign minister - over his interactions with the paedophile.Brende has acknowledged dining with Epstein three times in 2018 and 2019 and communicating with him by email and text, but said he was \"completely unaware\" of his past criminal activity. He added that he welcomes the WEF's decision to launch a review.",

    "body": "12 hours agoMatt McGrathEnvironment correspondentTrump announces rollback of Obama-era greenhouse gas rulingUS President Donald Trump has reversed a key Obama-era scientific ruling that underpins all federal actions on curbing planet-warming gases.The so-called 2009 \"endangerment finding\" concluded that a range of greenhouse gases were a threat to public health. It's become the legal bedrock of federal efforts to rein in emissions, especially in vehicles.The White House called the reversal the \"largest deregulation in American history\", saying it would make cars cheaper, bringing down costs for automakers by $2,400 per vehicle.Environmental groups say the move is by far the most significant rollback on climate change yet attempted and are set to challenge it in the courts.Speaking in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said the 2009 ruling  was \"a disastrous Obama era policy that severely damaged the American auto industry and massively drove up prices for American consumers\".\"This radical rule became the legal foundation for the Green New Scam, one of the greatest scams in history,\" added the Republican president, about the Democrats' climate agenda.Former President Barack Obama, who infrequently comments on the policies of sitting presidents, said that repealing the finding would make Americans more vulnerable.\"Without it, we'll be less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change — all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money,\" he wrote on X. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) first took a stance on the impacts of greenhouse gases in 2009, in the first year of Obama's first term.The agency decided that six key planet-warming greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, were a danger to human health.With a divided Congress unable to agree on legislation to tackle rising global temperatures, the EPA finding became central to federal efforts to rein in emissions in the years that followed.\"The endangerment finding has really served as the lynchpin of US regulation of greenhouse gases,\" said Meghan Greenfield, a former EPA and Department of Justice attorney.\"So that includes motor vehicles, but it also includes power plants, the oil and gas sector, methane from landfills, even aircraft. So it really runs the gamut, all of the standards for each of the sectors is premised on this one thing.\"Trump administration officials are stressing that overturning the regulation will save more than $1tn and will help cut the price of energy and transport.Reversing the finding would reduce automobile manufacturers' spending by $2,400 per vehicle, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.Many environmentalists are sceptical of the potential cost savings being touted by the Trump team. \"It's going to force Americans to spend more money, around $1.4tn in additional fuel costs to power these less efficient and higher polluting vehicles,\" said Peter Zalzal from the Environmental Defense Fund.\"We've also analysed the health impacts and found that the action would result in up to 58,000 additional premature deaths, 37 million more asthma attacks,\" he said.For some in the US car industry there will be uncertainty about the rollback as manufacturing less fuel-efficient vehicles might limit their sales overseas.\"This rollback is sort of cementing things that have already been done, such as the relaxation of the fuel economy standards,\" said Michael Gerrard, a climate law expert from Columbia University.\"But it really does put the US automakers in a bind, because nobody else is going to want to buy American cars.\"While the reversal will help the White House to roll back climate change regulations, there are likely to be unintended consequences, according to some observers.While working on overturning the finding, the Trump administration also utilised the 2009 ruling to prevent states from passing laws that would be stricter on carbon emissions.The fact that the finding gave responsibility for regulating warming gases to a federal authority was also used to suppress what are termed \"nuisance\" lawsuits, brought by individuals or organisations on the climate question.\"The endangerment finding decision has blocked any number of lawsuits, and has been pretty powerful in keeping plaintiffs' claims out of court ,\" said Meghan Greenfield, now with Washington law firm of Jenner & Block.\"I would expect states and non-profit groups to bring suits, probably primarily in our state courts, to try to figure out where the contours of this new law are.\"John Kerry to BBC: Trump's climate change policy will 'cost lives'Challenging climate science One key argument about the reversal of the endangerment finding will be about the science on which it is based. The Department of Energy formed a panel of scientists to write a report last year challenging widely accepted science on the warming impact of greenhouse gases.That report underpinned the initial proposal to reverse the 2009 finding.But many climate experts complained that the panel behind the report was unrepresentative and filled with people who were sceptical of the human influence on warming, and that it was inaccurate and misleading.While it's not clear how much the Trump administration will rely on this report to face off any challenges, a federal judge recently ruled that the department had violated the law in the formation of the hand-picked team that wrote it.In fact, a challenge in court on the reversal of the endangerment finding may well be what the Trump administration is now looking for.Many legal experts believe that they want the proposal to be tested in the Supreme Court before Trump's term ends, believing that if they win, the endangerment finding will be consigned to history.\"This is really different as the EPA is exiting the space entirely and wants to do it on a permanent basis,\" said Meghan Greenfield.\"If they were to win that issue as they framed it before the Supreme Court, a new presidential administration could not change that position, in the absence of new legislation.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinCQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty ImagesA federal judge has blocked Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth from lowering Senator Mark Kelly's rank in the military over his urging service members to refuse illegal orders. US District Judge Richard Leon wrote in a scathing ruling that Hegseth had unconstitutionally retaliated against Kelly in seeking to demote the retired Navy captain.In a post on social media, Hegseth said the judge's order would be \"immediately appealed\".It is another setback in the Trump administration's fight against Kelly and five other lawmakers who published a video encouraging troops to disobey orders they deemed illegal. A grand jury this week declined to bring charges of seditious conspiracy against them.Reducing Kelly's rank could lead to a major cut in his retirement pay.Kelly, who is also a former astronaut, sued the government in January, naming Hegseth as the defendant. He argued that Hegseth had illegally tried to demote him in retaliation for criticising the Trump administration. He asked the judge to block the demotion with a temporary injunction while his lawsuit proceeded.The federal government had argued Kelly should contest the case against him through a military process and not in a civilian court of law, but in Thursday's decision, Judge Leon wrote: \"I disagree.\"Leon wrote that while service members have more limited free speech protections than civilians under the US Constitution's first amendment, no court has ever extended those limits to retired service members.\"This Court has all it needs to conclude that Defendants have trampled on Senator Kelly's First Amendment freedoms and threatened the constitutional liberties of millions of military retirees,\" he wrote. \"To say the least, our retired veterans deserve more respect from their Government, and our Constitution demands they receive it!\"Soon after the judge issued the temporary injunction, Hegseth posted on X: \"This will be immediately appealed. Sedition is sedition, 'Captain.'\"In a statement, Kelly said that he appreciated \"the judge's careful consideration of this case, and the clarity of his ruling\". \"But I also know that this might not be over yet,\" he added, saying he was ready to keep fighting the Trump administration.In the video, the six Democratic lawmakers say that the administration \"is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens\".Kelly appears alongside Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin and US Representatives Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander, Chrissy Houlahan and Jason Crow, all of whom served in military or intelligence agencies.\"Our laws are clear,\" he says. \"You can refuse illegal orders.\"After the video was released, Trump posted on social media that the members of Congress should be arrested and put on trial. Labeling the video seditious behaviour, he posted: \"PUNISHABLE BY DEATH!\"Trump later clarified to Fox News: \"I'm not threatening death, but I think they're in serious trouble.\"Federal prosecutors then began criminal investigations into the lawmakers and sought to indict them on charges of seditious conspiracy. But a grand jury, which decides if a case can stand up on court, declined to approve the charges.Meanwhile, Hegseth announced he would open retirement-grade determination proceedings against Kelly and issue a formal letter of censure. He described Kelly's comments as \"seditious in nature\" and a violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.In his decision, which contained more exclamation marks than are typical in judicial writings, Leon wrote: \"Rather than trying to shrink the First Amendment liberties of retired servicemembers, Secretary Hegseth and his fellow Defendants might reflect and be grateful for the wisdom and expertise that retired servicemembers have brought to public discussions and debate on military matters in our Nation over the past 250 years.\"",

    "body": "21 hours agoJake KwonSeoul correspondentWatch: See Kim Ju Ae, the only known child of Kim Jong Un, attend events with her father over the yearsNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has selected his daughter as his heir, South Korea's spy agency told lawmakers on Thursday. Kim Ju Ae - who is believed to be 13 - has in recent months been pictured beside her father in high-profile events like a visit to Beijing in September, her first known trip abroad. The National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it took a \"range of circumstances\" into account including her increasingly prominent public presence at official events\" in making this assessment.The NIS also said it would keep close tabs on whether she will attend the North's party congress later this month - its largest political event that is held once every five years.The party Congress is where Pyongyang is expected to give more details about priorities like foreign policy, war planning and nuclear ambitions for the next five years.On Thursday lawmaker Lee Seong-kwen told reporters that Ju Ae, who was previously described by the NIS as being \"trained\" to be a successor, was now at the stage of \"successor designation\". \"As Kim Ju Ae has shown her presence at various events, including the founding anniversary of the Korean People's Army and her visit to the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, and signs have been detected of her voicing her opinion on certain state policies, the NIS believes she has now entered the stage of being designated as successor,\" Lee said.Ju Ae is the only known child of Kim Jong Un and his wife, Ri Sol Ju. The NIS believes Kim Jong Un has an older son, but this son has never been acknowledged nor shown on North Korean media.News of Ju Ae's existence first emerged through an unlikely source: the American basketball player Dennis Rodman, who revealed to The Guardian newspaper back in 2013 that he \"held baby Ju Ae\" during a trip to the secretive state.Ju Ae made her first appearance on state television in 2022. She was shown inspecting North Korea's latest intercontinental ballistic missile while holding her father's hand. She has since made frequent appearances on state media, softening her father's image of a ruthless dictator.  She accompanied him to Beijing for China's largest-ever military parade, where she was seen stepping off his armoured train at Beijing Railway Station.She is often seen wearing her hair long, which is forbidden for her peers, and wearing designer clothes, which are out of reach for most in her country.Another lawmaker, Park Sun-won said the role Ju Ae had taken on during public events indicated that she has started to provide policy input and is being treated as the de facto second-highest leader. The North Korean power had passed down the three generations of the Kim family, and it is widely believed that Kim Jong Un will pass on the throne to Ju Ae.In recent months, she was shown standing taller than her father, walking beside him, rather than following him. In North Korea, where photos published by the state media are believed to carry a great symbolic weight, it is rare for individuals other than Kim Jong Un to be positioned equally prominently in the frame.EPAAlthough the South Korean spy agency now believes Ju Ae is the designated heir, it still raises questions.It is puzzling why Ju Ae, a daughter, would be selected as the heir above an older son in North Korea's deeply patriarchal society. Many defectors and analysts had previously dismissed the idea of a woman leading North Korea as an unlikely scenario, referring to the country's entrenched traditional gender roles. But Kim Jong Un's sister - Kim Yo Jong - does offer a precedent for female authority in the regime.Kim Yo Jong currently holds a senior position in the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, and is reported to have influence over her brother.However, it is also a mystery why Kim Jong Un, who is still young and appears relatively healthy, is already designating a 13-year-old child as his heir now.It is unclear what changes Ju Ae's succession may bring to North Korea. Many North Koreans hoped that Kim Jong Un, a Western-educated young man, would open their country up to the outside when he succeeded his father. Yet such hope was unfulfilled. Whatever plans this teenager may have for her country, she would likely have the singular power to shape it however she likes.",

    "body": "Minnesota immigration enforcement surge is ending, Trump border tsar says13 hours agoBrandon DrenonUS border tsar: Minneapolis immigration enforcement surge endingThe US immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota will end, President Donald Trump's border tsar told reporters on Thursday.Tom Homan said Trump had approved his request to conclude the operation, adding he would stay in Minnesota \"a little longer to oversee the drawdown, to ensure its success\". Homan said Operation Metro Surge had resulted in many illegal immigrants who had committed violent crimes being detained for deportation. But the surge also sparked nationwide protests when two US citizens, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, were killed by immigration officers.After the news conference, top Minnesota and federal officials appeared at a Capitol Hill hearing on Trump's immigration crackdown.Officials in Minnesota have been able to \"greatly reduce the number of targets\" for immigration enforcement, Homan said, adding that Operation Metro Surge was a \"great success\".More than 4,000 undocumented immigrants had been arrested, according to Homan, including men he said were convicted of rape and other sexual misconduct. Homan said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has always had a presence in Minnesota and will continue to have one. He said that the surge's end came after an unprecedented level of cooperation between federal agents and local law enforcement, with local officials increasing their crackdown on protesters he called public safety threats and local jails more willing to notify ICE of the release dates for individuals it was seeking.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said at a news conference following Homan's announcement that he was \"cautiously optimistic\" about the drawdown of federal agents. \"The fact of the matter is they left us with deep damage, generational trauma,\" Walz said. \"They left us with economic ruin in some cases. They left us with many unanswered questions.\"The governor is expected to soon propose a $10m (£7m) emergency fund for small businesses who say they were financially hurt by the surge.Following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti last month, President Donald Trump dispatched Homan to Minneapolis to oversee the surge, sidelining the operation's leader, Greg Bovino, who had faced intense criticism for ICE's use of force and what many in the city alleged were civil rights violations.Trump's immigration crackdown has faced resistance in Democrat-led cities like Minneapolis from activists in the streets and local officials and immigrants in the courts. The administration last month finished removing National Guard troops from Portland, Los Angeles and Chicago - places where there had been large protests against the presence of troops and immigration agents - according to US Northern Command.Some Republicans, too, had questioned the Minneapolis operation.Senator Rand Paul told a committee hearing with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials on Thursday that \"saying we're going to reduce this presence in the street is a good sign and a good step forward\".\"I'm glad that's happening,\" the Republican from Kentucky said. \"I think that is de-escalation.\"ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons said at the hearing that the agency is tracking roughly 1.6 million undocumented immigrants with deportation orders in the US, including roughly 800,000 who have criminal convictions.He also defended against accusations from lawmakers that the agency was not holding officers accountable, saying ICE had launched 37 open investigations for excessive use of force since January 2025.The fight over how immigration agents operate has now put the federal government at risk of a partial shutdown as Congress debates a funding measure for the DHS, which includes ICE. On Thursday, the US Senate failed to advance a bill on new funding for the department. Earlier this month, lawmakers approved DHS funding for two weeks and had planned to use that time to negotiate a substantive deal. But with no agreement in sight and the upper chamber set to go on break, DHS could lose its funding starting Saturday. That will affect a variety of services, including transportation security at US airports and responses to disasters and large-scale emergencies. Last year, lawmakers passed legislation creating a separate pool of funding that should allow ICE to continue to operate.Democrats are demanding changes in ICE - such as ending the wearing of masks - in exchange for support for the bill. They are also pushing for immigration agents in Minnesota and elsewhere to be required to reveal their identities and to end warrant-less searches.",

    "body": "'Everyone knows somebody affected' - small Canadian town united in grief after mass shooting5 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporter, in Tumbler Ridge, British ColumbiaWatch: How the Tumbler Ridge school shooting unfoldedIn the small town of Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, residents are reeling after a mass shooting left nine people dead, including six children.\"We've been insulated,\" Tracy Krauss, a local pastor, told the BBC. \"A newcomer comes to town and they're locking up, and everyone laughs, because why are you doing that? Nothing happens here.\"Krauss said that sense of security now feels painfully naïve.On Thursday, police released the identities of the victims. They include 12-year-old Zoey Benoit, who was described by loved ones as \"the strongest little girl you could meet\".Another 12-year-old victim, Kylie Smith, was \"the light\" of her family who had dreams of attending art school in the big city, her family said in a statement.The tragedy has shaken the tight-knit town of about 2,400 people, which is set along a few winding rural roads in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. A memorial beside the school grew on Thursday, as people left flowers, teddy bears and handwritten notes in honour of the victims.Tuesday's incident is one of the deadliest mass shootings in Canada, where such attacks have historically been rare. Support has poured in from across the country, including from Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is scheduled to visit the town on Friday.ReutersMany questions remain about the shooting, with investigators still trying to determine why 18-year-old suspect Jesse Van Rootselaar carried out the attack. Van Rootselaar was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the school. Police say Van Rootselaar was born a biological male and began transitioning to female approximately six years ago. The suspect's mother and step-brother were among the victims. Both were found dead at a local residence, police said.Krauss said Van Rootselaar's family are well-known in the community. \"That family is victimised, too,\" she added, noting that surviving relatives will also be grieving.The suspect's mother and step-brother were killed first before the suspect headed to Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, where police responded to reports of a shooting at around 13:30 local time on Tuesday.Inside the school of 160 students, dozens sheltered in classrooms with their teachers as the attack unfolded. Among them was 17-year-old Darian Quist.Quist said he and 15 others hid in their mechanics class, barricading the door with metal tables. At first, they were unsure why they needed to hide, he said. They later learned that there was an active shooter through an alert on their phones.They hid for over two hours before Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and SWAT officers safely escorted them out.Quist said the shooting has left him and his classmates angry, saddened and shocked. \"That it happened in a place like this, it doesn't seem real,\" Quist said. \"But I know that it is,\" he added, \"that the people who lost their lives are real.\"Darian Quist was at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School when it went into lockdownOutside the school, parents gathered at a nearby community centre as they anxiously waited to be reunited with their children. Krauss, the pastor, said she went over to support a close friend whose son was at the school.  Krauss said her friend later learned that their child was among those who were killed.\"It was devastating, I don't know what else to say,\" she said through tears. \"They are gutted. To lose a child is the worst thing in the world.\"Krauss added that everyone in the town has been touched by the shooting in some way. \"Everybody knows somebody,\" she said. \"Even for those who haven't lost a loved one, they are still affected.\"Tumbler Ridge's history is rooted in mining, with the industry still employing many of the town's residents. It is also known for its picturesque scenery, with tourists drawn to its UNESCO-recognised geopark - one of only five in Canada.That natural beauty is how Bob Zimmer, the federal Conservative member of parliament representing the region, hopes Tumbler Ridge will be remembered, rather than for the tragedy that struck it this week.\"They want to be defined as a beautiful community with beautiful people,\" Zimmer told the BBC. \"But for now, there's a dark cloud. It's just going to take some time to mourn.\"Authorities did not say who had owned the previously seized guns, or how the suspect procured the weapons used in the shooting. They said Van Rootselaar had a gun licence which had expired in 2024.Zimmer acknowledged there will be difficult conversations in the aftermath of the shooting, including on whether there is an \"obvious need for more substantial mental health support\".But for now he said the community are focused on grieving.\"We're just here to give some hugs and tell (residents) that they are appreciated, and that there's hope,\" Zimmer said.\"But I think there are some serious questions that need to be answered after this.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoEmma Pengelly,BBC VerifyandGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianVantorIran has been fortifying an underground complex near one of its nuclear facilities, according to analysis of new satellite images.This activity comes at a time of heightened tensions as talks between Iranian and US officials continue, with President Donald Trump threatening fresh military action against Iran if it does not agree a new deal on its nuclear programme.The photos, first analysed by the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS), a US-based think tank, show tunnel entrances being strengthened at Mount Kolang Gaz La - also known as Pickaxe Mountain.Experts say this facility may be designed to protect Iran's uranium enrichment activities or key equipment, but its exact purpose - and whether it is operational - remains unclear.Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and denies it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.However, Trump said Iran was as little as a month away from having a nuclear weapon in June 2025, when he ordered strikes on three underground nuclear sites where centrifuges were being used to produce highly enriched uranium during a 12-day war between Israel and Iran last year.Trump said the strikes had \"obliterated\" Iran's enrichment capacity, but that Iranian officials \"were thinking about starting a new site\".Pickaxe Mountain was not one of the locations attacked in US and Israeli air strikes in June 2025, but the Natanz nuclear facility, located about 2km (1.24 miles) north, was hit.A satellite image from 10 February shows what appears to be fresh concrete laid on top of one of the Pickaxe Mountain entrance areas.A boom pump used to deliver concrete can be seen at the location, analysts from both ISIS and UK-based intelligence analysis firm Maiar agreed.At another tunnel entrance, rock and soil has been pushed back and flattened. There's also a new concrete-reinforced structure nearby.Experts at ISIS suggest these changes are intended to strengthen the tunnel entrances and give additional protection against a potential air strike.ISIS says the ongoing presence of heavy construction machinery and material indicates the facility is not likely to be ready for operations yet.\"In the past, Iran has tied the construction to rebuilding an advanced centrifuge assembly plant, but the size of the facility, as well as the protection provided by the tall mountain, raised immediate concern whether additional sensitive activities are planned, such as uranium enrichment,\" they said.Satellite images also show repair work and defensive strengthening has been taking place at the nearby Natanz nuclear site and at the Isfahan nuclear complex, 125km (77 miles) to the north, in recent weeks.At Isfahan, all entrances to its tunnel complex now appear to be sealed off with earth, satellite images reviewed by ISIS reveal..Backfilling the tunnel entrances like this would \"help dampen\" any air strike, ISIS says, as well as help to defend against a land-based assault to seize or destroy any highly enriched uranium that may be housed inside..ISIS has assessed the roof was added to block the view of anyone trying to observe what Iran was doing beneath it.Prof Sina Azodi, director of the Middle East Studies Program at George Washington University in the US, says Iran is \"operating under the assumption that the attacks are going to happen and they need to protect the facilities as much as they can\".\"[The] Iranian nuclear programme hasn't been destroyed,\" he added. \"Clearly once you have the knowledge and capacity and technology to reconstruct the programme, you can always rebuild everything.\"Rafael Grossi, the head of the global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, told the BBC a new nuclear deal between Iran and the US was possible and was urgently needed.\"My sense, talking to all those involved, is that we have a window of opportunity, but windows of opportunity have a tendency to shut themselves quite abruptly and brusquely, so I think the we need to seize the moment,\" he said in an interview at the Munich Security Conference.He also said he believed Iran's estimated 400kg of highly enriched uranium - which is a short, technical step away from weapons grade - remained in the underground tunnels and chambers where the US dropped bunker-busting bombs last June.Graphics by Tom ShielMore on this story",

    "body": "9 hours agoDaniel BushWashington correspondentReutersThe Trump administration lauded the move as an assault on overbearing regulationUS President Donald Trump framed his sweeping rollback of federal climate change policy on Thursday as a political win over the Democratic Party's \"radical\" environmental agenda, reprising a message Republicans have used in past elections and could turn to once again ahead of November's crucial midterms.His announcement at the White House was one of the most significant moves of his second term in office. The president said he was revoking an Obama-era \"endangerment finding\" from 2009 which held that pollution harms public health and the environment.For almost 17 years, the US has used that scientific finding as the legal basis to establish policies to reduce emissions from cars, power plants and other sources of planet-warming gases.\"This radical rule became the legal foundation for the Green New Scam,\" Trump said, using a term popular with Republicans for describing Democratic environmental and climate policies.The move marks the culmination of a decade-long push by Trump to tear up policies that Democrats and many climate experts say are needed to rein in emissions. And it is one of the most far-reaching reversals of American climate policy yet.Trump, who has called climate change a \"hoax\" and a \"con job\", dismissed the science underpinning the Obama-era rule in remarks that at times took on the air of a victory lap over his Democratic opponents.It was yet another sign that, for the president, this issue is as much a political one as it is scientific.He focused on the economic impacts of reversing the endangerment finding, arguing that boosting fossil fuels instead of clean energy would lead to lower energy costs for American consumers.Trump also singled out the US auto industry as a major beneficiary of the change.He said ending the endangerment finding would do away with an electric vehicle \"mandate\" put in place by his predecessor, former President Joe Biden. Under Biden, Congress passed a law to expand the nation's electric vehicle charging network and created tax incentives to lower the cost of EVs, but it did not include any provisions forcing buyers to purchase them.Trump announces rollback of Obama-era greenhouse gas rulingLee Zeldin, the administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency, made the announcement alongside the president and described the 2009 scientific ruling as the \"holy grail of climate change religion\".Both men framed its revocation as an assault on overbearing federal regulations - part of a longtime message from Republicans that bureaucratic red tape is hindering economic growth. Zeldin said past climate policies had \"strangled entire sectors of the United States economy\".This decision is \"the single largest act of deregulation in the history of the United States of America,\" he said.The rollback sparked fury, meanwhile, among Democrats and environmental groups who said it would wreck the US's ability to combat climate change. \"We'll be less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change - all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money,\" former President Barack Obama wrote on social media.Trump reversed numerous Obama-era energy and environmental regulations in his first term in office. He also withdrew the US from the Paris climate accord, an agreement by countries around the world to lower emissions and address rising sea levels, natural disasters and other problems exacerbated by global warming.Trump repeated the action at the start of his second term, reversing Biden's decision to reinstate the US in the international climate pact.In recent years, climate policy in the US has swung wildly depending on who is occupying the White House. But the announcement on Thursday represented the largest move yet by Trump to dismantle the climate policies put in place by his Democratic predecessors.It also revived a campaign trail fight from the past few national elections, which pitted Trump against Democrats in Congress who backed wide-ranging climate and environmental policies known as the \"Green New Deal\".John Kerry to BBC: Trump's climate change policy will 'cost lives'Whether the strategy of climate rollbacks can help Republicans pick up votes in the November midterm elections, which will decide control of Congress for the rest of Trump's term, remains to be seen.The issue rarely appeared as a top priority for voters in exit polls in the 2024 presidential election - with the economy and cost of living frequently ranking top. Perhaps with this in mind, Trump took pains to argue Thursday's move would save consumers thousands on a new car. Many environmentalists, however, are sceptical of this claim.Trump and many Republicans have also argued that Democrats' climate policies are extreme and out-of-touch with public sentiment.But opinion polls indicate a growing percentage of Americans are worried about global warming - a potential warning sign for Republicans who embrace Trump's climate record in November.In the US, 63% of Americans say they are worried about global warming, compared to 37% who say they are not worried, according to a 2024 study by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.A 2025 Gallup poll indicated that a record 48% of American adults think global warming will pose a serious threat in their lifetime, up from 25% in 1997.At the White House on Thursday, Trump dismissed a question about whether he was concerned his decision would be unpopular with the public. He argued that the country would be better off without the climate change regulations of the past.That era is \"dead, gone, over\", he said.",

    "body": "Sussan Ley and the glass cliff: Does Australian politics still have a problem with women?5 hours agoTiffanie TurnbullSydneyGetty ImagesSussan Ley was ousted as Liberal leader after only nine monthsWhen Sussan Ley made history as the first woman to take the reins of Australia's Liberal Party, she insisted this was a pivotal moment for the party – or what was left of it anyway.She had broken through the glass ceiling: an invisible, patriarchal barrier which keeps women from positions of power.But to many, Ley's glass ceiling looked an awful lot like a \"glass cliff\", and it felt like it was only a matter of time before she lost her grip and slipped off it.The glass cliff describes a phenomenon where women and other minorities are promoted to leadership roles during times of crisis, setting them up for a high risk of failure. In essence, it says that when women are finally allowed to ascend to the top, it's frequently so they can take the fall.Elected as leader after the most resounding election defeat in the history of the modern Liberal Party and amid internal party chaos, Ley didn't even survive a year.On Friday she was pushed out by Angus Taylor, who argued she didn't have what it takes to turn the opposition's fortunes around. He won a leadership ballot 34 to 17, with Senator Jane Hume elected as his deputy.Ley's backers claim she was never given the chance to succeed, with some saying gender played a role. Her opponents say her demise has nothing to do with that and everything to do with performance.The messy saga has reignited conversations in Australia about its progress towards making its politics look more like its population.'Crisis on every front'Whoever took over as Liberal leader after the Labor landslide in May last year was always going to have a tough job.They had to unify the polarised factions of the party and manage an increasingly toxic relationship with their coalition partner of eight decades, the National Party - a small but vocal and often mutinous cohort of rural MPs.They had to overhaul a policy platform which was comprehensively rejected by voters. And they had to do this while balancing the demands of the more conservative sects of the Coalition with the more progressive desires of voters in the urban areas where they were ravaged at the polls.Then they also had to repair the Liberals' reputation with women, who have deserted them en-masse after a string of allegations of misogyny levelled during the Coaliton's previous term of government, which ended in 2022.\"There was just crisis on every front… it's classic glass cliff,\" says Michelle Ryan, Director of the Global Institute for Women's Leadership and one of the researchers who coined the term.Getty ImagesAngus Taylor has long held leadership ambitionsFrom her very first press conference as leader, Ley was aware of what this looked like.She and her supporters insisted she had been selected exactly for this moment, because she was the right person to lead the Coalition through it.She is a moderate who can appeal to city slickers, yes, but one from a bush electorate who can speak National. She's been in parliament for 20 years and was a cabinet minister for five. With an unusual but impressive resume that includes time as a pilot and a sheep musterer, Ley says she has spent her entire life breaking down barriers, challenging assumptions and making room for herself in places women weren't always welcome.Some critics say the idea of a glass cliff itself is offensive, that it diminishes women's achievements and assumes they can't successfully lead out of a crisis, when in fact many in the community feel women fare better in them.\"As far as political analysis goes, it is just wrong,\" Ley wrote in an op-ed for the Women's Agenda shortly after she took over.\"There is no doubt that all too often women are left to clean up the mess… But when the most successful political party in our nation's history picks a leader, it doesn't do so based on chromosomes.\"I earned my shot.\"Few are saying she didn't. But the Liberal Party famously passed over Julie Bishop in 2018, an electorally popular and long-serving minister who had been the party deputy for 11 years.Getty ImagesMany in the party say Julie Bishop should have been their first female leaderPolitical observers say there was a sense Ley was only keeping the seat warm for Taylor, whose first leadership bid failed by a slim margin after a controversial choice in running mate.The glass cliff phenomenon doesn't paint the true picture of Ley's tenure though, says Niki Savva, a veteran political commentator and former Liberal Party advisor.\"Sometimes I get really impatient with the argument that all this is happening to Ley because she's a woman. She hasn't been given a fair go because she's a woman,\" she tells the BBC.\"Maybe a tiny bit, but that is not the real reason… Sussan Ley is the architect of her own fortunes.\"She promised not to make unilateral calls as leader, which seemingly opened the door to relentless pressure - public and private - from her peers. She promised to listen to the electorate on climate, but facing opposition from the conservative members of the Coalition, rolled back her party's promise to reach net-zero by 2050. And though she played a leading role in pushing the government to hold a royal commission into antisemitism in the wake of the Bondi attack - which she says she's proud of - critics accused her of politicising the tragedy. She also oversaw two short-lived but ugly break-ups between the Liberals and Nationals.\"Political leaders are judged on their performance, not on their gender,\" Liberal Senator, and prominent Taylor backer, James Paterson said on Thursday. \"Newspoll shows she's at negative 39 personal approving approval rating. That is the worst performance of an opposition leader in 23 years.\"The driver behind her abysmal approval rating, Savva says, is her lack of conviction on issues she said she cared about.\"If she had gone out there and staked out her territory, gone out and fought for it, then maybe her position would not be as dire as it is today.\"Ryan, though, argues both things can be true.\"It really isn't about whether Ley is qualified for the job or not… It's not even about her performance in this job,\" Ryan says.\"It's about when is it that the party will put a woman ahead.\"Women still rare at the topJulia Gillard, the nation's first female prime minister, is the only woman aside from Ley to lead one of its two major parties.She said at the end of her misogyny-plagued tenure in 2013: \"Being the first female prime minister does not explain everything about my prime ministership, nor does it explain nothing about my prime ministership.\"It's true that representation in parliament has grown dramatically since Gillard's era – largely driven by her party, Labor, who more than 30 years ago set ambitious quotas, both for selecting female candidates in winnable seats, and promoting them into leadership.While the Coalition party rooms remain about a third female, the Labor caucus is now majority women – 57% – a historic achievement. And there is gender equality in cabinet too.But women are still rare at the very top.Getty ImagesFormer PM Julia Gillard is the only other woman to lead one of Australia's major partiesAnthony Albanese's leadership team is the first from Labor without at least a female deputy since 2001, aside from a three-month blip in 2013. Albanese was part of that woman-less leadership team too.And though Penny Wong is senate leader and foreign minister, women still tend to have more junior cabinet roles or positions in non-cabinet ministries.\"Being able to say we've had a female prime minister, that's great, we've just got to get beyond one,\" Ryan says. \"You have to do it again, and then you have to do it again.\"But over the three decades Labor has used to increase its gender diversity through quotas, doyens of both the Liberal and National parties, even Ley herself, have been arguing they don't need them – to the frustration of many of the women in their ranks.Gender shouldn't matter in politics, they say, something which critics say fails to acknowledge the reality that it long has, and still does.\"Instead of, as a woman, getting out there and arguing for quotas, standing up for them, Ley came out with this line, which I just thought was BS, about being a zealot for getting more women into parliament, but agnostic on quotas,\" Savva says.\"Well, what the hell did that mean? And what did she do about it subsequently? Big fat zero.\"Getty ImagesTeal candidates like Kate Chaney have filled gaps left by the Liberal PartyAnalysts say this reluctance from the Liberals to champion strong female candidates has helped fuel the rise of independents. More than 70% of crossbench MPs in this parliament are women, many of them so-called \"Teal\" candidates who have won in traditionally blue, Liberal seats.Ley, who after the leadership spill announced she would resign from parliament, said there was \"no doubt\" it had been \"a challenging time to lead the party\".\"It is important that the new leader gets clear air, something that is not always afforded to leaders,\" she said, a parting jab at her successor.This episode is unlikely to help resolve the Liberal Party's quandaries.Election post-mortems, as well as consistent feedback from polling and interest groups, point towards the desire for a more diverse Liberal Party that reflects modern Australia, and a more cooperative, stable one.At best, recent events show disorganisation and disunity, commentators say. At worst, they're another show of a stubborn Liberal Party reluctant to learn from its mistakes.",

    "body": "9 hours agoCaitlin WilsonWatch: How the Tumbler Ridge school shooting unfoldedEight people were killed in two shootings - at a school and at a home - in the Canadian Rockies town of Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, this week.Another 27 people were injured, meaning many residents in the rural community of just 3,000 people will know someone who was a casualty of Tuesday's attacks.Here is what we know about the victims.Jennifer Jacobs and Emmett JacobsRCMPThe mother of 18-year-old shooting suspect Jesse Van Rootselaar is among the victims. Jennifer Jacobs, 39, who was also known as Jennifer Strang, was one of two of Van Rootselaar's family members found dead at a local residence, British Columbia's Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said. Van Rootselaar was found dead on the scene from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said. Court documents related to a family dispute from 2015 show that Jacobs and her children had spent years travelling around Canada, with a judge saying the family led \"an almost nomadic life\", moving between \"Newfoundland, Grand Cache and Powell River, British Columbia\" over five years.  She was then ordered to return with the children to British Columbia.Van Rootselaar's 11-year-old step-brother, Emmett Jacobs, was also killed at the residence, the RCMP confirmed. Kylie SmithRCMPAmong the victims killed at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School was 12-year-old Kylie Smith, the RCMP confirmed on Thursday. \"Kylie was the light in our family. She loved her family, friends, and going to school,\" her family said in a tribute shared by the police. \"She was a talented artist and had dreams of going to art school in the big city of Toronto,\" the statement said. \"Rest in paradise, sweet girl, our family will never be the same without you.\"Abel MwansaRCMPAbel Mwansa, who was 12, is being remembered for his beautiful smile and love of science. He was also a great soccer player who always gave it his all on the pitch and was ready to jump in and help his teammates, his coach Tyler Curry told Global News. His father, a pastor, wrote on social media:  \"If I had power to give life I would have brought you back to life together with others that where killed alongside you but son my power is limited, and seeing your child murdered at this age is heart breaking.\" He told CBC News that his son was \"ambitious\" and had a genuine smile, which he often flashed.  Zoey BenoitRCMPZoey Benoit, 12, was killed at the secondary school, the RCMP confirmed. \"She was so resilient, vibrant, smart, caring and the strongest little girl you could meet,\" Benoit's family said in a statement shared by the police. \"She brought so much laughter and smiles in her presence. She loved spending time with her family where she could show her love. Our family is devastated by this loss, but we will cherish her memories with us so close to our hearts forever.\"\"She will forever be loved and never forgotten. We miss you beautiful girl, Zoey we love you so much,\" the statement said. Getty ImagesShannda Aviugana-DurandShannda Aviugana-Durand, a 39-year-old, was also killed at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, the RCMP confirmed. In a statement on social media, the BC General Employees Union (BCGEU) posted a tribute to Aviugana-Durand who was an educator.\"We are grieving the profound loss of one of our union members whose life was taken in this terrible event. Shannda Aviugana-Durand, 39, was a member of the BCGEU and worked at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School,\" the statement said.\"We extend our deepest condolences to the family, friends, coworkers, and all those whose lives she touched.\"Student victims RCMPEzekiel Schofield, 13, was killed at Tumbler Ridge Secondary SchoolOther deceased victims named by the police include Ticaria Lampert, 12, and Ezekiel Schofield, 13, who were both students at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School.

    "body": "Chen Ning Yang, Nobel laureate and one of the world's most influential physicists, has died at the age of 103, according to Chinese state media.An obituary released by CCTV cited illness as the cause of death.Yang and fellow theoretical physicist, Lee Tsung-Dao, were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957 for their work in parity laws, which led to important discoveries regarding elementary particles - the building blocks of matter. Yang was also a professor at Beijing's prestigious Tsinghua University and an honorary dean of the Institute for Advanced Study at the institution.Born in 1922 in China's eastern Anhui province, he was the oldest of five children and raised on the campus of Tsinghua University where his father was a professor of mathematics.As a teenager, Yang told his parents: \"One day, I want to win the Nobel Prize.\"He achieved that dream at the age of 35, when his work with Lee studying the law of parity earned them the honour in 1957.The Nobel committee praised \"their penetrating investigation... which has led to important discoveries regarding the elementary particles\".Yang received his science degree in 1942 from National Southwest Associated University in Kunming, and later completed a master's degree at Tsinghua University.At the end of the Sino-Japanese War, he travelled to the US on a fellowship from Tsinghua and studied at the University of Chicago, where he worked under Italian physicist Enrico Fermi, inventor of the world's first nuclear reactor.Throughout a prolific career, he worked across all areas of physics, but maintained particular interest in the fields of statistical mechanics and symmetry principles.Yang received the Albert Einstein Commemorative Award in 1957 and was also awarded an honorary doctorate by Princeton University in 1958.Yang married his first wife Chih Li Tu in 1950, with whom he had three children.After Tu's death in 2003, Yang married his second wife Weng Fan, who is more than 50 years his junior.The pair had first met in 1995 when Weng was a student in a physics seminar, and later reconnected in 2004. At the time, Yang called her his \"final blessing from God\".",

    "body": "2 days agoAna FaguyGetty ImagesAfter serving 43 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, Subramanyam \"Subu\" Vedam was finally free. New evidence had exonerated him earlier this month of the murder of his former roommate.But before he could reach his family's arms, Mr Vedam was taken into custody by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), who want to deport him to India - a country he has not lived in since he was a baby.Now, Mr Vedam's legal team is fighting a deportation order and his family is determined to get him out of custody, for good.His family are now working to navigate a new and \"very different\" situation, his sister Saraswathi Vedam told the BBC. Her brother has gone from a facility where he knew inmates and guards alike, where he mentored fellow inmates, and where he had his own cell, to a facility where he shares a room with 60 men and where his history of good behaviour and mentorship is unknown.Mr Vedam has been repeating one message to his sister and other family members in the wake of the new situation: \"I want us to focus on the win.\"\"My name has been cleared, I'm no longer a prisoner, I'm a detainee.\"The 1980 murderMore than 40 years ago, Mr Vedam was convicted of murdering his once-roommate Tom Kinser, a 19-year-old college student. Kinser's body was found nine months after he went missing in a wooded area with a bullet wound in his skull. On the day of Kinser's disappearance, Mr Vedam had asked him for a ride. While the vehicle Kinser drove was returned to its usual spot, no one saw it being returned. Mr Vedam was charged with Kinser's murder. He was denied bail, had his passport and green card seized by authorities and was labelled a \"foreigner likely to flee\".Two years later he was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1984, he was sentenced to a separate two-and-a-half to five years for a drug offence, as part of a plea agreement. That sentence was to be served simultaneously with his life sentence. Throughout that time, Mr Vedam maintained his innocence on the murder charges. His supporters and family members stressed there was no physical evidence tying him to the crime. Getty ImagesMr Vedam's exoneration Mr Vedam repeatedly appealed the murder conviction and a few years ago new evidence in the case surfaced which exonerated him. Earlier this month, Centre County District Attorney Bernie Cantorna said he would not pursue a new trial against Mr Vedam.But Mr Vedam's family knew there was one hurdle left before he was free: he still had a 1988 deportation order, based on his convictions for murder and a drug offence. The family expected they would have to file a motion to have his immigration case reopened, Ms Vedam said. The facts of the case are different now, she stressed.But when they arrested him, ICE cited the immigration order as their reasoning for quickly detaining him in a different Pennsylvania facility. While he was exonerated for the murder charge, his drug conviction still stands, they have said. The immigration agency said it acted on a lawfully issued order.ICE did not respond to the BBC's request for comment, but told other US outlets that Mr Vedam will remain in custody pending his deportation. Mr Vedam's family has said his decades of good behaviour, completion of three degrees and community service while behind bars should be considered when the immigration court examines his case.\"What was deeply disappointing was that we didn't even have a moment to hold him in our arms,\" Ms Vedam said. \"He was held wrongly and one would think that he conducted himself with such honour and purpose and integrity that that should mean something.\"Potential deportation to IndiaThe family has stressed Mr Vedam's ties to India - where ICE has said they would like to deport him to - are weak at best. While he was born there, he moved to the US at nine months old. What relatives are still alive, are distant ones, Ms Vedam told the BBC.His community - Ms Vedam, her four daughters and other cousins - are in the US and Canada. \"He will again be robbed and miss out on the lives of the people closet to him, by being half way across the world,\" she said. \"It's almost like having his life stolen twice.\"Mr Vedam, who is a legal permanent resident, had his citizenship application accepted before he was arrested. Both of his parents were also both US citizens.\"We believe deportation from the United States now, to send him to a country where he has few connections, would represent another terrible wrong done to a man who has already endured a record-setting injustice,\" his lawyer, Ava Benach said in a statement to the BBC.",

    "body": "2 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThe 4.8% growth in the third quarter marked a slowdown from 5.2% in the three months to JulyChina's economic growth slowed in the three months to the end of September as problems in the property market persisted and trade tensions with the US flared up.The world's second-largest economy grew by 4.8% compared to the same period in 2024, its weakest pace in a year, official figures released on Monday show.The data comes after China imposed sweeping controls on its exports of rare earths - minerals essential for the global production of electronics - a move that rocked its fragile trade truce with the US.The third-quarter growth figures will set the tone for a gathering of China's top leaders this week to discuss the country's economic blueprint over the next five years.The latest growth figure marked a slowdown from the annual rate of 5.2% seen in the three months to July.China's National Bureau of Statistics said the economy showed \"strong resilience and vitality\" against pressure . It credited momentum in its technology sector and business services as key growth drivers.Beijing has set a goal of \"around 5%\" economic growth this year and has so far avoided a sharp downturn, helped by government support measures and what - until recently - had been a trade ceasefire with Washington.When China announced controls on rare earths earlier this month, US President Donald Trump responded swiftly by threatening an additional 100% tariffs on imports from China.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said he expects to meet Chinese officials this week in Malaysia in an attempt to ease tensions and set up a meeting between Trump and his counterpart Xi Jinping.Before the recent flare-up, Chinese businesses had taken advantage of the trade truce with Washington to ship goods to the US, resulting in China's exports rising by 8.4% in September. The total value of imports to China was also up.China's industrial output grew by 6.5% last month from a year earlier, with its 3D-printing, robotics and electric vehicles manufacturers among its strongest performers.Its service sector, which includes IT support, consultancies, and transport and logistics companies, also grew.Getty ImagesChina has been struggling with a property crisis since 2021The latest data shows that China's exports have helped to offset its \"sluggish\" domestic spending, according to Sheana Yue, senior economist at Oxford Economics.Beijing has spent billions on incentives such as subsidies, higher wages and discounts to encourage locals to spend more and lift its economy.However, Ms Yue said it was unlikely China's economic growth this year would exceed 4.8% without further government support, which could come with the new Five-Year Plan laying out Beijing's economic goals.China's property sector also continued to struggle as real estate investment fell 13.9% in the year up to September.The housing market is going through a sharp downturn, marked by falling home prices, shrinking sales and instances of developers abandoning their projects.The real estate sector accounts for about a third of the Chinese economy and has been a major source of income for local governments.Home prices have fallen in almost every major city despite government support measures, said economics lecturer Laura Wu from Nanyang Technological University.In the long-run, housing \"is still the major drag on China's economic growth\" even as it faces uncertainty from Washington's tariffs and other trade barriers, said Prof Wu.",

    "body": "4 hours agoMartin YipHong Kong andStuart LauWatch: Wreckage of cargo plane seen at Hong Kong International AirportA cargo plane skidded off a runway at Hong Kong International Airport and landed in the sea early on Monday, killing two ground staff.Emirates flight EK9788 was arriving from Dubai at about 03:50 local time (19:50 GMT) when it veered off the runway and collided with an airport patrol vehicle.The two people inside the vehicle died, while the four crew members onboard the plane survived the crash.It marks one of Hong Kong's deadliest aviation incidents in years - the city's international airport has had a good safety record.Authorities have launched an investigation as questions remain over the path taken by the plane upon landing.Airport officials have said they gave the correct instructions to the plane and that there are signs on the runway to guide aircraft.Airport operations executive director Steven Yiu said the patrol car was, at the time, travelling on a road outside of the runway's fencing \"at a safe distance from the runway\". The plane then turned away from the runway, crashed through the fencing and collided with the vehicle, pushing it into the sea, Mr Yiu explained.\"Normally the plane is not supposed to turn towards the sea,\" he said at a news conference hours after the incident, adding that the plane did not send out a distress signal when it was landing.He stressed that the airport patrol car \"definitely did not run out onto the runway\".Divers managed to locate the bodies of the patrol vehicle’s driver and passenger in the sea.The two dead ground staff were aged 30 and 41 and had seven and 12 years' experience respectively, officials said. Hong Kong's transport bureau has said it was \"saddened\" by their deaths and expressed condolences to their families.In a statement to the BBC, an Emirates spokesperson said the plane \"sustained damage on landing in Hong Kong\", adding: \"Crew are confirmed to be safe and there was no cargo onboard.\"It also said the Boeing 747-481 cargo aircraft was wet leased from, and operated by, Turkish carrier Act Airlines. A wet lease is an arrangement where one airline provides the aircraft, crew, and insurance to another airline.The four crew members onboard the plane had opened the emergency doors of the aircraft shortly after the crash. They were spotted by fire service staff who arrived at the scene within two minutes, and were rescued, authorities said.Pictures show the plane had broken in half, with part of the fuselage submerged in the water with large cracks clearly visible. At least one emergency evacuation slide deployed successfully.ReutersPart of the plane's fuselage is lying in the water off the runwayA police official told the media that criminal investigations would not be ruled out.An official from the Hong Kong Air Accident Investigation Authority (AAIA) said they were still trying to locate the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder - also known as the black boxes - from the sea.The affected runway would remain closed for the rest of the day, but the airport's other two runways are still in operation.At least 11 cargo flights initially scheduled to arrive at Hong Kong International Airport on Monday have been cancelled, according to the Airport Authority's website.It marks the second ever deadly incident at the airport since it moved from Kai Tak to Chek Lap Kok in July 1998. In August 1999, a China Airlines passenger flight crash landed during a typhoon, killing three people.",

    "body": "44 minutes agoKoh EweSingapore andJake KwonSeoulA South Korean court has sentenced a teacher to life in prison for fatally stabbing an eight-year-old girl, in a case that shocked the nation.Myeong Jae-wan, 48, killed Kim Hae-neul, after luring her into a classroom in the central city of Daejeon in February.Prosecutors had sought the death penalty for Myeong, saying that the victim's family had asked for a harsh punishment.But the court said that while \"the risk of reoffending is high, it is difficult to conclude\" that Myeong must be executed.Myeong said that she would reflect on her mistakes for the rest of her life. She said her judgement had weakened at the time of the stabbing as she was receiving mental health treatment.Prosecutors said Myeong showed no remorse while the case was being investigated. However, Myeong submitted dozens of letters to the court expressing remorse.Myeong had previously requested a six-month leave of absence, citing depression, but returned to school in 20 days, after a doctor assessed her as being fit to work, the Daejeon education office said in February.She had displayed violent behaviour in the days before the stabbing, including putting another teacher in a headlock, the education office said.On the morning of the stabbing, two education officials had visited the school to investigate that earlier altercation.Myeong told police that she had bought a weapon on the day of the attack and brought it to school, planning to kill herself along with a random child.She also told the police that she had lured Kim into the media room before attacking her.Kim, the student, student was reported missing after a bus driver informed the school that she had not arrived to be picked up that day. She was found in school later that day with stab wounds, along with Myeong.Myeong also had a wound on her neck, which police said might have been self-inflicted. It was stitched up later in hospital.South Korea's leaders at the time called for safety measures to ensure such incidents never happen again.Myeong has also been ordered to wear an electronic location tracking device for 30 years.\"As an elementary school teacher, the accused was in a position to protect the victim,\" said the court's verdict on Monday. \"But she committed this brutal crime in which a child was not protected where they should be most safe.\"",

    "body": "16 hours agoAna Faguy andKathryn ArmstrongPresident Donald Trump said the US will no longer offer subsidies to Colombia, one of the country's closest South American allies.The US president announced the decision in a Truth Social post on Sunday, labelling Colombia's President Gustavo Petro as \"an illegal drug leader\" who has \"strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields, all over Colombia\".His comments come after Petro accused the US of committing \"murder\" when it carried out a military strike on a boat in Colombian territorial waters in September.The move is the latest in a string of escalating tensions between the US and countries in Latin America, as the US military continues to strike ships in the Caribbean Sea it alleges carry drugs.Trump said because the US offers \"large scale payments and subsidies\" and Petro \"does nothing\" to stop the drug production, the US will no longer offer \"payment or subsidies\" to Colombia. According to a government website, the US provided over $740m (£551m) in aid to Colombia in 2023. It is unclear if all of that aid will stop, or when. In September, for the first time since 1996, the US declared that Colombia had failed to uphold its drug trafficking promises, and is ineligible for aid as defined in the Foreign Assistance Act. But the state department included a waiver that allowed Colombia to continue to receive aid. But following Petro's recent accusation of Americans committing \"murder\", Trump has escalated matters and says he will halt aid.Under Petro, cocaine production has reached a record-level and the country has failed to reach its coca eradication goals, the state department said in September. Petro has said the US violated his country's sovereignty killing a Colombian fisherman with its September attack. Posting on social media, he said: \"The Colombian boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure,\" when it was struck. He added: \"We await explanations from the US government.\"\"Fisherman Alejandro Carranza had no ties to the drug trade and his daily activity was fishing. The Colombian boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure.\"Alejandro Carranza was reportedly killed on 15 September when US forces allegedly fired on his boat while he was fishing the Caribbean.Trump has defended the ongoing boat attacks, saying they are aimed at stemming the flow of drugs from Latin America into the US, but his government has not provided evidence or details about the identities of the vessels or those on board.UN-appointed human rights experts have described the US strikes as \"extrajudicial executions\".The escalation between Trump and Petro comes on the heels of another attack on a ship in the Caribbean sea. That attack, which happened on Thursday, is at least the sixth US strike on ships in the Caribbean Sea in recent weeks. At least 27 people were killed in the prior five boat strikes in the waters off Venezuela, according to figures released by the US administration.The Thursday attack, on a submarine, is the first time survivors have been reported, though the attack also killed two people.  Trump  said US intelligence confirmed the vessel was \"loaded up with mostly Fentanyl, and other illegal narcotics\". The US president said two people who survived the submarine attack would be returned to their countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia.They were transferred to a US Navy ship, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. BBC SOUNDS: Why has Trump authorised CIA action in Venezuela?In recent weeks, Trump has ramped up threats against Venezuela's leadership over claims that the country is sending drugs to the US. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused Trump of trying to make the South American nation \"an American colony\".Trump earlier told reporters that he had authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, and that he was considering launching attacks on Venezuelan soil.",

Maccabi Tel Aviv has not yet commented, except to confirm the match was cancelled.The decision by Birmingham's Safety Advisory Group (SAG) to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from the Aston Villa match on 6 November has sparked widespread criticism.The UK government has since said it is working to overturn the ban and exploring what additional resources might be required to ensure the fixture can be hosted safely.Villa told their matchday stewards that they did not have to work at the game, saying they understood that some \"may have concerns\".On Thursday, West Midlands Police said it supported the ban and classified the fixture as \"high risk\" based on intelligence and previous incidents.That included \"violent clashes and hate-crime offences that occurred during the 2024 Uefa Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel-Aviv in Amsterdam\", when more than 60 people were arrested.There have been protests at various sporting events over the war in Gaza, including when Israel played Norway and Italy in recent football World Cup qualifiers.",

    "body": "1 hour agoNoor NanjiCulture reporter andGeorge WrightVirginia Giuffre says she feared she might \"die a sex slave\" at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and his circle, her posthumous memoir reveals. The BBC has obtained a full copy of Nobody's Girl, written by the prominent accuser of convicted sex offender Epstein, ahead of its publication on Tuesday - almost six months after she took her own life.In the memoir, Ms Giuffre also says she had sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions, including once with Epstein and approximately eight other young women.Prince Andrew, who reached a financial settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, has always denied any wrongdoing.The memoir, which the BBC bought from a book store in central London days before its official release, paints a picture of a web of rich and powerful people abusing young women.At the centre of the abuse was Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year sentence on sex-trafficking charges.Ms Giuffre says that even decades later, she remembers how much she feared them both.Much of the book makes for extremely harrowing reading, as Ms Giuffre details the sadistic abuse that Epstein put her through.She says Epstein subjected her to sadomasochistic sex which caused her \"so much pain that I prayed I would black out\".A Buckingham Palace source told BBC News they accept there could be \"more days of pain ahead\" as a result of the publication of the book, which puts Prince Andrew under further scrutiny. The King's engagements this week include a visit to the Vatican, where he will pray alongside the Pope.On Friday, Prince Andrew announced that he was voluntarily deciding not to use his titles including the Duke of York, an honour received from his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II.He is also giving up membership of the Order of the Garter - the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in Britain.In his statement, he said: \"I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"While Andrew, who remains a prince as son of a monarch, will no longer be using his titles, a small number of MPs are calling for them to be officially removed from him. They include Rachael Maskell, Independent MP for York Central, and Stephen Flynn, SNP leader at Westminster. But Henry Zeffman, BBC chief political correspondent, said: \"I think the government is extremely unlikely to take the lead on this. \"It may well be that developments require further action against Andrew but if they do, I think it would be the monarchy making that judgment call and the government following suit, rather than the other way around.\"The new book, written by Ms Giuffre and ghostwriter Amy Wallace, puts the prince under even more scrutiny.In the memoir, Ms Giuffre says she first met Prince Andrew in March 2001.She writes that Maxwell woke her up and told her it was going to be a \"special day\" and that \"just like Cinderella\" she was going to meet a \"handsome prince\".She says that when she met Prince Andrew later that day, Maxwell told him to guess her age.The prince, who was then 41, \"guessed correctly: seventeen\", Ms Giuffre said. \"My daughters are just a little younger than you,\" she recalls him saying.That night, she says she attended London's Tramp nightclub with Prince Andrew, Epstein and Maxwell, where she says the prince \"sweated profusely\".In a car on the way back to Maxwell's house afterwards, Ms Giuffre writes that Maxwell told her: \"When we get home, you are to do for him what you do for Jeffrey.\"She wrote that back at the house they had sex.\"He was friendly enough, but still entitled - as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she says.\"The next morning, it was clear that Maxwell had conferred with her royal chum because she told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun.'\"Ms Giuffre writes that she \"didn't feel so great\", adding: \"Soon, Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy' -  a lot of money.\"Ms Giuffre says she had sex for a second time with the prince around a month later at Epstein's townhouse in New York.She says the third occasion was on Epstein's island as part of what Ms Giuffre called \"an orgy\".She writes that she said in a sworn declaration in 2015 that she was \"around 18\".\"Epstein, Andy, and approximately eight other young girls and I had sex together,\" she says. \"The other girls all appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn't really speak English. \"Epstein laughed about how they couldn't really communicate, saying they are the easiest girls to get along with.\"Later in the book, Ms Giuffre touches on her 2022 out-of-court settlement with Prince Andrew after she brought a civil case against him.\"I agreed to a one-year gag order, which seemed important to the prince because it ensured his mother's Platinum Jubilee would not be tarnished any more than it already had been,\" she writes.While Ms Giuffre's alleged interactions with Prince Andrew have been widely reported by the British press, the book's content is wider in scope - littered with sinister details of Epstein's sex trafficking.The girls were required to look \"childlike\", Ms Giuffre says, and her childhood eating disorder was \"only encouraged\" under Epstein's roof.\"In my years with them, they lent me out to scores of wealthy, powerful people,\" she writes.\"I was habitually used and humiliated - and in some instances, choked, beaten, and bloodied.\"I believed that I might die a sex slave.\"Epstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a person under the age of 18. He died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.On Sunday, the Metropolitan Police said it was \"actively\" looking into media reports that Prince Andrew tried to obtain personal information about Ms Giuffre through his police protection officer (PPO).According to the Mail on Sunday, the prince asked the officer to investigate Ms Giuffre just before the newspaper published a photo in February 2011 of her first meeting with the prince.The newspaper alleged that he gave the officer her date of birth and confidential social security number.Dai Davies, the former head of royal protection at Scotland Yard, told BBC One's Breakfast the issue was \"scandalous\" adding: \"It needs to be put to bed one way or another.\"\"If - and I say if - there's any evidence of criminality either under the data protection act or malfeasance in public office, then that has to be carefully considered, and then a report sent to the Crown Prosecution [Service],\" he said.\"And clearly the government themselves then would have to act, in terms of his status still as a prince.\"A royal source told the BBC there are currently no plans for the removal of the prince title that Andrew was born with.\"The headlines are taking a lot of oxygen out of the royal room,\" they added, referring to press about Prince Andrew diverting attention away from King Charles's engagements.In 2019, the prince repeatedly told BBC Newsnight that he did not remember meeting Ms Giuffre \"at all\" and that they \"never had any sort of sexual contact.\"Buckingham Palace has not commented.Virginia Giuffre's brother calls on King to strip prince Andrew of 'prince' title",

    "body": "44 minutes agoGabriela PomeroyReutersSecurity measures \"failed\" in preventing a major jewellery heist in the Louvre museum in Paris on Sunday, creating a very negative image of the country, the French justice minister has said.\"People were able to park a furniture hoist in the middle of Paris, get people up it in several minutes to grab priceless jewels and give France a terrible image,\" Gérald Darmanin said.Thieves wielding power tools broke into the world's most-visited museum in broad daylight, stealing eight items described as being of inestimable value, before escaping on scooters. There are fears that unless the thieves are caught quickly, the priceless items - including a diamond and emerald necklace Emperor Napoleon gave to his wife - will be broken up and smuggled out of the country.Darmanin told France Inter radio he was certain police would eventually arrest the thieves.But the head of an organisation specialising in the location and recovery of stolen and looted artworks warned that if the thieves are not caught in the next 24 to 48 hours, the stolen jewellery will likely be \"long gone\".\"There is a race going on right now,\" Chris Marinello, the chief executive of Art Recovery International, told BBC World Service's Newshour programme. Crowns and diadems - which were stolen in the heist - can easily be broken apart and sold in small parts. The thieves \"are not going to keep them intact, they are going to break them up, melt down the valuable metal, recut the valuable stones and hide evidence of their crime,\" Mr Marinello said, adding it would be difficult to sell these jewels intact.The French police \"know that in the next 24 or 48 hours, if these thieves are not caught, those pieces are probably long gone,\" he said.\"They may catch the criminals but they won't recover the jewels.\"Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen A tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenThe theft took place between 09:30 and 09:40 local time on Sunday morning, shortly after the museum opened to visitors.Four masked thieves used a truck equipped with a mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine.Pictures from the scene showed a vehicle-mounted ladder leading up to a first-floor window.EPA/ShutterstockThe thieves approached the building from the River Seine banksideTwo of the thieves cut through glass panes with a battery-powered disc cutter and entered the museum.They then threatened the guards, who evacuated the building.The thieves smashed the glass display cases and stole the jewels, which collectively contained thousands of diamonds and precious gemstones.The robbery took just seven minutes.As the museum's alarms started blaring, staff followed protocol by contacting security forces, the culture ministry said in a statement.The thieves had tried to set fire to their vehicle outside but were prevented by the intervention of a museum staff-member, it added.Eight items of jewellery were stolen in total, including an emerald and diamond necklace that Napoleon gave his wife, Empress Marie Louise.Also taken was a diadem (jewelled headband) that once belonged to the Empress Eugénie - wife of Napoleon III - which has nearly 2,000 diamonds.They also took a necklace that once belonged to Marie-Amelie, the last queen of France, and which contains eight sapphires and 631 diamonds, according to the Louvre's website.Louvre crowds evacuate after museum robbery",

    "body": "China will soon have a new Five Year Plan. Here's how they have changed the world so far10 hours agoNick MarshAFP via Getty ImagesChina's top leaders are gathering in Beijing this week to decide on the country's key goals and aspirations for the rest of the decade.Every year or so, the country's highest political body, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, convenes for a week of meetings, also known as a Plenum.What it decides at this one will eventually form the basis of China's next Five Year Plan - the blueprint that the world's second largest economy will follow between 2026 and 2030.The full plan won't come until next year, but officials are likely to hint at its contents on Wednesday and have previously given more details within a week of that.\"Western policy works on election cycles, but Chinese policy making operates on planning cycles,\" says Neil Thomas, a fellow in Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute.\"Five Year Plans spell out what China wants to achieve, signal the direction the leadership wants to go in and move the resources of the state towards these predefined conclusions,\" he adds.On the surface, the idea of hundreds of suited bureaucrats shaking hands and drawing up plans may appear drab - but history tells us that what they decide often has huge repercussions for the world.Here are three times China's Five Year Plan reshaped the global economy.1981-84: \"Reform and Opening Up\"Pinpointing exactly when China began its journey to become an economic powerhouse is difficult, but many in the Party like to say it was on 18 December 1978.For nearly three decades, China's economy had been rigidly controlled by the state. But Soviet-style central planning had failed to lift prosperity and many were still struggling in poverty. The country was still recovering from Mao Zedong's devastating rule. The Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution - campaigns led  by Communist China's founder to reshape the nation's economy and society - resulted in millions of deaths.Speaking at the 11th Committee's Third Plenum in Beijing, the country's new leader Deng Xiaoping declared that it was time to embrace some elements of the free market.His policy of \"reform and opening up\" became integral to the next Five Year Plan, which began in 1981.The creation of free trading Special Economic Zones - and the foreign investment they attracted - transformed the lives of people in China.Getty ImagesDeng Xiaoping's opening up of China's economy included a landmark agreement with US President Jimmy Carter in 1979According to Mr Thomas, the aims of that Five Year Plan could not have been achieved more emphatically.\"China today is beyond the wildest dreams of people in the 1970s,\" he says. \"In terms of restoring national pride as well as establishing its place amongst the great powers of the world,\" he says.But it also fundamentally reshaped the global economy. By the 21st Century, millions of western manufacturing jobs had been outsourced to new factories in China's coastal regions.Economists have called this \"the China shock\" and it's been one of the driving forces behind the rise of populist parties in former industrial parts of Europe and the United States.For example, Donald Trump's economic policies - his tariffs and trade wars - are designed to bring back the American manufacturing jobs lost to China over the previous few decades.2011-15: \"Strategic emerging industries\"China's status as the workshop of the world was cemented once it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. But at the turn of the century, the Communist Party leadership was already planning its next move.It was wary of China falling into the so-called \"middle income trap\". This happens when an upwardly mobile country can't offer ultra-low wages anymore, but at the same time doesn't have the innovative capacity to create the high-end goods and services of an advanced economy.So instead of just cheap manufacturing, China needed to find what it called \"strategic emerging industries\" - a term first officially used in 2010. For China's leaders, this meant green technology, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and solar panels.As climate change became increasingly important in Western politics, China mobilised an unprecedented amount of resources into these new industries.Today, China is not only the undisputed world leader in renewables and EVs, it also has a near monopoly over the rare earth supply chains needed to build them.China's stranglehold on these key resources - which are also crucial to chip-making and artificial intelligence (AI) - now puts it in a powerful position globally.So much so that Beijing's recent move to tighten export controls on rare earths was labelled by Trump as an attempt to \"hold the world captive\".Although \"strategic emerging forces\" was enshrined in the next Five Year Plan in 2011, green technology had been identified as a potential engine of growth and geopolitical power by China's then leader Hu Jintao in the early 2000s.\"This desire for China to be more self-reliant in its economy, in its technology, in its freedom of action, goes back a long way - it is part of the fibre of Chinese Communist Party ideology,\" explains Neil Thomas.2021-2025: \"High quality development\"This may explain why China's Five Year Plans more recently have turned their attention to \"high quality development\", formally introduced by Xi Jinping in 2017.This means challenging American dominance in technology and putting China at the forefront of the sector.Domestic success stories such as the video sharing app TikTok, telecommunications giant Huawei and even DeepSeek, the AI model, are all testament to China's technological boom this century.But western countries increasingly see this as a threat to their national security. The subsequent bans or attempted bans on popular Chinese technology have affected millions of internet users around the world and have sparked bitter diplomatic rows.Grigory Sysoev/RIA Novosti/Pool/Anadolu via Getty ImagesUnder Xi, China's Five Year Plans have focused on \"high quality development\"Until now, China has powered its tech success using American innovation, such as Nvidia's advanced semiconductors.Given their sale to China has now been blocked by Washington, expect \"high quality development\" to morph into \"new quality productive forces\" - a fresh slogan introduced by Xi in 2023, which tilts the focus more towards domestic pride and national security.This means putting China at the cutting edge of chip-making, computing and AI - not reliant on Western technology and immune to embargoes.Self-sufficiency in all areas, especially at the very top end of innovation, is likely to be one of the central tenets of the next Five Year Plan.\"National security and technological independence are now the defining mission of China's economic policy,\" Mr Thomas explains. \"Again, it goes back to that nationalist project that underpins communism in China, to ensure it never again is dominated by foreign countries\".",

    "body": "Harper Lee's newly found stories reveal 'a brilliant writer in the making', her family say2 hours agoKatie RazzallCulture and Media EditorGetty ImagesMolly Lee is talking to me about the tales her aunt Nelle, known to the world as Harper Lee, would weave for her when she was a little girl. \"She was just a great storyteller,\" says the 77-year-old from her home in Alabama.That's an understatement if the success of Harper Lee's Pulitzer-prize winning novel To Kill A Mockingbird is anything to go by. Since its publication in 1960, when it was an instant hit, the book has sold more than 42 million copies worldwideBased around the story of Tom Robinson, a black man falsely accused of rape, it's told through the eyes of two white children, Jean Louise 'Scout' Finch and her brother Jem - and is often described as an American classic.But at the point Molly is describing, before the world had heard of Lee, she was simply an aunt enchanting her niece with stories, often by riffing on one of her favourite authors, the British novelist Daphne Du Maurier.\"The stories that she told me, she would make them up but they all seemed to be based around, 'It was a dark and stormy night'... It seemed to me they were always on the moor and she would just take me into the dark,\" Molly says.Molly's cousin is 77-year-old Ed Lee Conner. His earliest memories of his aunt date back to the late 1940s, when he was tiny. \"She sang to me in a way that was very funny,\" he recalls. \"And I laughed.\" He gives me a rendition, half-singing I've Got a Little List from the musical The Mikado. Ed says he only realised much later that \"she was singing to me songs from Gilbert and Sullivan\", the Victorian-era duo Lee \"adored\" all her life.It seems some of Lee's influences were British, even if her roots were in Monroeville, Alabama at a time of strict segregation, when schools, churches and restaurants were divided on race lines.Casey CepHarper Lee's nephew, Dr Edwin Lee Conner and niece, Molly Lee, who said their aunt was \"funny\" and \"a brilliant writer\"The cousins are sharing their memories of their aunt - who died in 2016  - on the eve of the publication of a new book, The Land of Sweet Forever. It's a series of newly discovered short stories Lee wrote in the years before Mockingbird, as well as previously published essays and magazine pieces.Ed explains: \"I knew there were unpublished stories, I had no idea where the manuscripts of those stories were.\"They were discovered in one of his aunt's New York City apartments after she died, a time capsule from the start of Lee's career which help explain how a young woman from Alabama became a best-selling author whose work addressed the turbulent issues of her age.Molly is \"very pleased\" that the stories have been found. \"I think it's interesting to see how her writing evolved and how she worked on her craft,\" she says. \"Even I can tell how she improved.\"Getty ImagesHarper Lee with her father, Amasa Coleman Lee, newspaper editor and lawyer, who was the inspiration for Atticus Finch, a character who also features in the short story, The Pinking ShearsSome elements will be familiar to fans of To Kill A Mockingbird. Versions of Jean Louise Finch appear, although she hasn't gained her nickname Scout yet. In one of the stories, The Pinking Shears, the character is a spirited little girl called Jean Louie who gives a friend a haircut and faces the wrath of the child's father. Perhaps a hint of the forthright Scout to come? In another, The Binoculars, a child starting school is berated by the teacher for already knowing how to read. A version of that story appears early on in Mockingbird. Some of them are set in Maycomb, Alabama, the fictional town which also stands for Monroeville in To Kill A Mockingbird.Getty ImagesActress Mary Badham and Harper Lee on the set of the To Kill A Mockingbird film, in 1961 at Monroeville, Alabama Ed, who's a retired English professor, calls them \"apprentice stories\" which aren't \"the fullest expression of her genius and yet there's genius in them\". \"She was a brilliant writer in the making and you see something of her brilliance in these stories.\"I found one, The Cat's Meow, an unsettling read through a modern lens. Set in Maycomb, it sees two siblings, clearly Lee and her older sister Alice, confounded by her sister's black gardener Arthur, who's from the North but has apparently decided to work in the segregationist South. The older sister tells the younger one he's a \"Yankee\" who has \"as much education as you have\".Written in 1957, seven years before the groundbreaking Civil Rights Act of 1964, Lee's own approach to the civil rights movement appears to be evolving. Some of the language in the story and at times, even the narrator's own attitudes, are uncomfortable to read.Ed thinks that's a \"fair assessment\"He points to Go Set A Watchman, the novel Lee published just a year before she died after the manuscript was found decades after she wrote it. As liberal as the narrator thinks she is, \"she's not entirely liberated from her own prejudices, let's put it that way\", Ed says.\"And I don't say that in any demeaning sense because for white southerners, it's not easy to rid ourselves of all the prejudices that we have born over the centuries.\"Getty ImagesGregory Peck won an Oscar for his role as Atticus Finch, who defended Tom Robinson (Brock Peters)The publication of Go Set A Watchman sparked controversy. Atticus Finch, the anti-racist hero of To Kill A Mockingbird, is portrayed as a racist. There were questions about whether Lee, who had significant health issues by then, had the capacity to give full consent. (An investigation by the state of Alabama found claims of elder abuse were unfounded).I ask whether it's an invasion of Lee's privacy to publish posthumously these stories that Lee didn't choose to make public in her lifetime. Ed Lee Conner is clear that, when it comes to The Land of Sweet Forever, \"that's an easy judgment to make, she attempted to publish all these stories\".And he believes - like Mockingbird - the stories have something to say about modern race relations in the US which is \"part of the continuing relevance of what she wrote\".To Kill A Mockingbird \"had a huge influence on the way a lot of people thought about race relations in the United States\".Writing a book about a black man's struggle that's centred on white characters, particularly Atticus Finch, the white lawyer played by Gregory Peck in the 1962 film, has led, in later years, to accusations of white saviourism. Ed tells me his aunt \"was writing a novel primarily for a white audience who I think would need to see a figure like Atticus Finch much more clearly and much more humanly in their lives, even as a fictional character, in order to influence them as much as she could\".Getty ImagesPresident George W. Bush awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Harper Lee in 2007, for her contribution to literatureIn an interview in 1964 for the New York radio station WQXR, Harper Lee described the \"sheer numbness\" she felt at the reaction to her debut novel.\"I never expected that the book would sell in the first place,\" she said. \"I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers. I was hoping that maybe somebody might like it well enough to give me some encouragement about it.\"Ed's side of the family had been given it in proof, ahead of publication. At age 13, he read the whole book in two days. \"I was absolutely enthralled and it was one of the highlights of my youth.\"He says the whole family shared her feelings of numbness at its reception. \"We all loved it and thought it was a terrific novel, but we had no idea... that it would go on to be as phenomenal a success as it was.\"Harper Lee had looked after Molly and her brother while she was writing it. \"She was in her bedroom typing away and she locked the door and she'd come out and play with us and then go back to typing.\"When Molly read the book, as a 12-year-old, \"I'm not sure that I ever looked up from it. I was totally engrossed.\"Dr Edwin Lee Conner/Harper Lee EstateOn the left: Harper Lee's father, Amasa Coleman Lee in his home in Monroeville with his grandchildren (including Ed Lee Conner with hat and Molly Lee standing) in 1953, and on the right, a previously unseen photograph of Nelle Harper LeeI play them part of the WQXR interview that their aunt did four years after the book came out. It's the only known recording of Harper Lee talking about To Kill A Mockingbird.She retired from public life soon afterwards. Ed says she wasn't a recluse as some have suggested and was very sociable with the people she knew. She'd simply realised, after the novel's success and then the hugely popular film, that she didn't need to promote it anymore.\"She did not particularly enjoy public appearances,\" he recalls. \"She had no interest whatsoever in being a celebrity. So there was a point at which she decided no more interviews.\"Michael BrownHarper Lee, whose writing changed \"the way we saw each other, and then the way we saw ourselves\" -- in a tribute from the former US President Barack ObamaListening to her speaking on this precious recording is its own time capsule. In her soft southern accent, melodic and lilting, she talks not just about being numbed at the reaction to the book, but also why she believes the southern states are \"a region of storytellers\" and how she wants to be \"a Jane Austen of South Alabama\".Hearing her voice again \"just makes me smile,\" Molly says.\"I love hearing it,\" agrees Ed, clearly moved. \"It's wonderful.\"The Land of Sweet Forever by Harper Lee is published on 21 October 2025.",

    "body": "1 day agoJulie Yoonnyung LeeBloomsbury PublishingFor South Koreans, tteokbokki is more than a snack. It's soul food. This sweet and spicy dish made with chewy rice cakes is a staple of Korea's street food culture and beloved by people of all ages.It's the food students turn to after long school days, and as adults, one you seek after a hard day at work.So when readers came across a book titled I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki in 2018, many were immediately intrigued. Its honest yet playful title sparked curiosity, some wondering just how much you must love tteokbokki to write an entire book about it. Many were soon drawn to its raw honesty.It became an instant bestseller that was widely discussed and resonated deeply in Korea. This week, Baek Se-hee, the book's South Korean author, died aged 35. The details surrounding her death remain unclear. The fact the Korean Organ Donation Agency said Baek had saved five lives by donating her organs, emphasised her wish to help others.Her death at such a young age has brought deep sorrow to readers who found comfort and understanding in her words. Social media and blogs have been flooded with tributes and personal stories from those her books have helped, while news outlets around the world reported her passing prominently.At its heart, the book is a record of Baek's conversations with her psychiatrist as she navigates dysthymia - a mild but long-lasting type of depression - and anxiety disorders. Through these sessions, she opens up about her daily struggles - such as overthinking others' opinions, obsessing over her appearance, and wrestling with self-doubt. Rather than examining clinical depression, she reflects on the gentle melancholy many can relate to.What makes her story so compelling is its candour. She captures that delicate human contradiction of living wearily with everyday sadness alongside the simultaneous desire to keep going. Just like a comforting dish of tteokbokki on a difficult day, her words offer warmth and understanding, reminding readers that even in vulnerability there is strength.A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line. If you are outside of the UK, you can visit the Befrienders website.Instagram / Baek Se-heeBaek Se-hee's memoir was lauded for its honest portrayal of mental health conversations'It's okay not to be perfect'One of the many young people the book resonated with is Jo Eun Bit, a 25-year-old student at Korea University in Seoul, who found it helped her navigate uncertainty about her future.\"All generations in Korea tend to measure themselves against what others are doing and the achievements they've made, and that only fuels competition,\" she said. \"But I liked this book because it seems to send the message that it's OK not to live according to the standards set by society.\"One of the most memorable passages in her book is that I am a one-of-a-kind being in this world, and that alone makes me special. I am someone I should care for throughout my life. The more I look within myself, the happier I believe I will become.  \"To me, this offered comfort that it's OK not to be perfect, and at the same time reminded me that I, too, am someone who needs to be nurtured and cared for.\"Passages of the book resonated with Jo Eun BitThe relentless competition from school to the workplace, coupled with the pressure to meet family and societal expectations, is leaving many young South Koreans feeling disheartened. In a society still influenced by Confucian values such as righteousness and obedience, mental health issues remain heavily stigmatised and many experience feelings of shame or social judgement.Baek's book inverted the notion that social success is the ultimate measure of a life well lived, openly addressing the mental health issues many commonly face and, in doing so, showing readers that acknowledging your emotions is the first step towards healing.Sangeun Lee, an elementary school teacher in Korea, told the BBC the book has held a particularly special meaning to her for that reason. \"With the rise of social media, we're exposed to other people's lives too much, and it makes us increasingly critical of ourselves,\" the 35-year-old said.\"Being imperfect is natural for everyone, but seeing so much of this kind of information can feel like an attack on yourself, making you wonder if it's even OK to live the way you do. This book encouraged me to accept myself as I am.\"Something many people relate toThe book's popularity has had a real-world impact, supporting many struggling with depression to seek professional help. It has also brought mental health issues into public conversation - RM of BTS, the globally renowned K-pop group known for songs promoting self-love, is among those who have shared the book online.Baek's pages have resonated far beyond South Korea. First published in 2018, it has sold more than a million copies worldwide and been translated into 25 languages. In the UK, it sold 100,000 copies within six months of its release.It has struck a chord with young women and played a significant role in expanding the reach of Korean literature. Marianna Szucs, a secondary school teacher in London, told the BBC she felt a connection to it and deep sorrow at Baek's death.\"Her book tells you that if you feel depressed or feel like you have problems, you are not the only one. She had all sorts of problems, from tiny little things to quite daunting ones. I think anyone who reads this book can find something they can relate to.\"Seunghye Sun, director of the Korean Cultural Centre UK, said \"it is highly symbolic that Baek Se-hee's voice has found resonance in the UK where great psychoanalysts like Freud and his daughter explored the human mind\", in the process broadening the spectrum of K-literature and K-culture.Her book tells a story that transcends generations and borders, sending a quiet but warm message to countless nameless readers around the world.In the end, the paradoxical title \"I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki\" may, in fact, be another way of saying, \"I want to live.\" Even in moments of deep despair, people often find the strength to carry on through small joys.For her, that joy was tteokbokki, and it shows even the simplest pleasures in daily life can become a sustaining force.More weekend picks",

    "body": "13 hours agoHugh SchofieldParis correspondentAFPIt is the most spectacular robbery at the Louvre museum since the Mona Lisa disappeared in 1911.And it poses serious questions about levels of security covering French artworks, at a time when they are increasingly being targeted by criminal gangs.According to France's new interior minister Laurent Nuñez, the gang that broke into the Apollo Gallery on Sunday morning was clearly professional.They knew what they wanted, had evidently \"cased the joint\" in advance, had a brazenly simple but effective modus operandi, and needed no more than seven minutes to take their booty and get away.In a truck equipped with an elevating platform of the type used by removal companies, they parked on the street outside, raised themselves up to the first floor, then used a disc-cutter to enter through a window.Inside the richly decorated gallery they made for two display-cases which contain what remains of the French crown jewels.Most of France's royal regalia was lost or sold after the 1789 Revolution, but some items were saved or bought back. Most of what was in the cases, though, dates from the 19th Century and the two imperial families of Napoleon and his nephew Napoleon III.Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen A tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenAccording to the authorities, eight items were taken including diadems, necklaces, ear-rings and brooches.They had belonged to Napoleon's wife the empress Marie-Louise; to his sister-in-law Queen Hortense of Holland; to Queen Marie-Amelie, wife of France's last King Louis-Philippe, who ruled from 1830 to 1848; and to the empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, who ruled from 1852 to 1870.A crown of the empress Eugénie was also taken, but was recovered damaged near the museum after the thieves seemingly dropped it.In a statement the culture ministry said that the alarms had sounded correctly. Five museum staff who were in the gallery or nearby followed protocol by contacting security forces and protecting visitors.It said the gang had tried to set fire to their vehicle outside but were prevented by the intervention of a museum staff-member.'An embarrassment': BBC's Andrew Harding reports from scene of Louvre robberyThe heist took place in a gallery just a short walk from some of the world's most famous paintings – such as the Mona Lisa.But the criminal groups that order heists like this do not target world-famous paintings that cannot ever be displayed or sold. They prefer items that can be converted into cash – and jewels top the list.However huge their historical and cultural value, crowns and diadems can easily be broken apart and sold in bits. Even large and famous diamonds can be cut. The final sales price might not be what the original artefact was worth, but it will still be considerable.Two recent museum thefts in France had already alerted the authorities to the growing audacity of art gangs, and a security plan drawn up by the culture ministry is gradually being put into effect across France.  Louvre MuseumThieves attempted to take Empress Eugenie's crown but apparently dropped it during the getaway\"We are well aware that French museums are vulnerable,\" said Nuñez.In September thieves took raw gold – in its mineral state – from the Natural History Museum in Paris. The gold was worth about €600,000 (£520,000) and will have been easily disposed of on the black market.In the same month thieves took porcelain worth €6m from a museum in Limoges – a city once famous for its chinaware. The haul could well have been commissioned by a foreign buyer.The Louvre contains thousands of artworks that are famous around the world, and an equal number of more obscure items that are nonetheless culturally significant.But in its 230-year history there have been relatively few thefts – largely thanks to the tight security in place.The most recent disappearance was of a landscape by the 19th Century artist Camille Corot. Le Chemin de Sèvres (The Road to Sèvres) was simply removed from a wall in 1998 when no-one was looking, and has not been seen since.But by far the most famous theft was the one that took place in 1911, when Leonardo da Vinci's La Joconde – better known now as the Mona Lisa – was taken. The culprit back then hid in a closet overnight, then was able to remove the painting from its frame, wrap it up in his smock, tuck it under his arm and walk out.It turned out he was an Italian nationalist who wanted the artwork brought back home. It was found in Italy in 1914 and returned to the Louvre.Unless they have a quick success in catching the thieves, today's investigators are unlikely to be so lucky.  The first aim of the gang will be to disperse the jewels and sell them on. It will not be hard.",

    "body": "1 day agoFREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty ImagesThe Donald Trump \"baby blimp\", which has become a common sight at protests over the years, made an appearance in Los AngelesGrace Eliza GoodwinNew York andCaitlin WilsonWashingtonHuge crowds took part in \"No Kings\" protests against President Donald Trump's policies in cities across the US on Saturday, including New York, Washington DC, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles.Thousands packed New York City's iconic Times Square and streets all around, with people holding signs with slogans like \"Democracy not Monarchy\" and \"The Constitution is not optional\".Ahead of the demonstrations, Trump allies accused the protesters of being linked with the far-left Antifa movement, and condemned what they called \"the hate America rally\". Several US states had mobilised the National Guard. But organisers said the events, which drew nearly seven million people, were peaceful.Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has expanded the scope of presidential power, using executive orders to dismantle parts of the federal government and to deploy National Guard troops to US cities despite objections by state governors. He has also called on the administration's top law enforcement officials to prosecute his perceived enemies.The president says his actions are necessary to rebuild a country in crisis and has dismissed accusations that he is a behaving like a dictator or fascist as hysterical. But critics warn some of the moves by his administration are unconstitutional and a threat to American democracy.In an interview with Fox News, set to air on Sunday, Trump appeared to address the rallies.\"A king! This is not an act,\" Trump said in a preview clip of the interview. \"You know – they're referring to me as a king. I'm not a king.\"In New York, sections of the crowd regularly erupted into chants of \"This is what democracy looks like\" as a near-constant drumbeat boomed in the background.Helicopters and drones could be seen flying overhead, and police stood on the sidelines.The New York Police Department said more than 100,000 people had gathered across all five of the city's boroughs, and that no protest-related arrests were made. Stephani Spindel/VIEWpressThousands of people filled Times Square in New York CityBeth Zasloff, a freelance writer and editor, said she had joined the New York protest because she feels outraged and distressed at \"a move toward fascism and an authoritarian government\" happening under the Trump administration.\"I care a lot about New York City,\" she said. \"It gives me hope to be out here with many, many other people.\"Grace Eliza Goodwin/BBCBeth Zasloff was proud to be among the thousands of protesters in New York CityMassimo Mascoli, a 68-year-old retired electronic engineer and resident of New Jersey who grew up in Italy, said he was protesting because he was concerned the US was following the same path that his home country did in the last century. Mr Mascoli said he was particularly worried about the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and healthcare cuts for millions of Americans. \"We cannot count on the Supreme Court, we cannot count on the government,\" he told the BBC. \"We cannot count on the Congress. We have all the legislative, the executive and judiciary that are all against the American people right now. So we are fighting.\"Grace Eliza Goodwin/BBCMassimo Mascoli protested in New York City against what he sees as a rise in fascism in the US AUSTIN CASEY JOHNSON/AFP via Getty ImagesGrant Baldwin/Getty ImagesA frog gets in on the action in Kansas City, MissouriThese protesters in Cornelius, North Carolina, encouraged cars to beep in support ReutersDancing and dress-ups in Washington DCAmericans are deeply divided on Donald Trump - and the protests. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that only 40% approved of his performance as president, while 58% disapproved. It is common for presidents to become more unpopular as their term wears on. Joe Biden had a 55% approval rating, according to Reuters/Ipsos, in January 2021. By October of that year, his approval had declined to 46%.Some on the right dubbed have dubbed yesterday's demonstrations the \"hate America\" rally -  a position contested by those who participated on Saturday.Speaking to the crowd in Washington, DC, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders said \"We're not here because we hate America, we're here because we love America\".Senator Chris Murphy shared footage of the huge turnout in his home state of Connecticut: \"Breathtaking. This is why today will likely go down as the biggest day of peaceful protest in our nation's 250 year history.\"But Republican governors in several US states had placed National Guard troops on standby ahead of the protests.\"We'll have to get the National Guard out,\" Kansas Senator Roger Marshall said ahead of the rallies, according to CNN. \"Hopefully it'll be peaceful. I doubt it.\"Texas Governor Greg Abbott activated his state's National Guard, saying they would be needed due to the \"planned antifa-linked demonstration\" in Austin.About 30,000 people attended the Austin protest, which remained peaceful.Virginia's Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin also ordered the state National Guard to be activated, though local reports said troops were not present during the protest.In Washington, DC, where the National Guard guard has been deployed since August at Trump's request, no troops were visible at the protest, either.One protester at the rally in the capital held up a sign that read \"I am Antifa\".Chuck Epes, 76, said it was a \"loaded\" term, and just meant he supported \"peace, daycare, liveable wage, healthcare\".\"He's gaslighting everybody - or trying to, and it ain't working,\" he said.The protests weren't confined to the US.Throughout Europe, there were also demonstrations Berlin, Madrid and Rome as people showed solidarity with their American counterparts. In London, several hundred protesters gathered outside the US embassy. There were similar scenes in Toronto, where demonstrators near the US consulate waved signs including \"Hands off Canada\".With additional reporting by Ana FaguyWiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing via Getty ImagesProtesters gathered outside the US embassy in London in solidarity with the demonstrations taking place across the AtlanticProtesters gather for \"No Kings\" demonstrations against Trump",

    "body": "Video has emerged appearing to show the alleged thieves behind the Louvre heist making their escape on a mechanical ladder in broad daylight.Two people can be seen looking around frantically as they slowly descend, minutes after the famed Paris museum was broken into and €88m-worth  (£77m)  of France's crown jewels were stolen.    The gang of four thieves have not been caught and on Wednesday, the Louvre's boss admitted that staff had failed to spot them early enough because there was only one camera pointing on the gallery where the items were displayed.In the video, the truck fitted with the ladder is seen parked by on a busy road running along the Seine as vehicles pass. Laurence des Cars told French lawmakers that the Louvre planned to double the number of CCTV cameras in and around the museum. She admitted that the camera trained on the Gallery of Apollo, the south-side room where the jewels were kept, was facing the wrong way.Paris city prosecutor Laure Beccuau told the Ouest France newspaper that up to 150 DNA samples and fingerprints had been retrieved so far as part of the police investigation.The theft happened in less than eight minutes, after the thieves arrived at 09:30 on Sunday (07:30 GMT) after the Louvre opened its doors to the public.They stole eight items including an emerald necklace and earrings given as a wedding gift by Napoleon Bonaparte to his second wife, Marie-LouiseAs they fled, they dropped a 19th-Century diamond-studded crown belonging to Empress Eugenie. Although it was recovered, the crown was damaged and des Cars said it had probably been crushed as the thieves prised it from its display case.",

    "body": "A woman who raped and murdered 12 year-old Lola Daviet in Paris has been handed a rare whole-life sentence in a case that has shocked France. Dahbia Benkired, aged 27, must spend at least 30 years in prison after a panel of judges and a jury decided to impose the country's harshest possible penalty.A whole-life term is extremely rare in France and Benkired is the first woman to receive it.Those who have been given the sentence include serial killer and rapist Michel Fourniret and jihadist Salah Abdeslam, who took part in the 2015 Paris attacks which killed 130 people.Following the verdict, Lola's mother Delphine Daviet said: \"We believed in justice and we got it.\" Her brother Thibault, added: \"We have restored the memory of my sister, we have restored the truth.\"Warning: This story contains distressing detailsLola was murdered in October 2022. Her body was discovered in a plastic storage box in the courtyard of the building where she lived in north-eastern Paris. Benkired is an Algerian immigrant who was under orders to leave the country. French right-wing and far-right politicians have seized on the case.The prosecutor in trial had argued for Benkired to received the longest sentence possible. Benkired was examined by psychiatric experts and found to have \"psychopathic\" traits but otherwise sane.The prosecutor told a panel of three judges and six jurors: \"Make no mistake no drug treatment can fundamentally transform Ms Benkired's personality. When there is no illness, there is no treatment.\"Before jurors began their deliberations on Friday, Benkired told the court: \"I ask for forgiveness and what I did is horrible.\"That's all I have to say.\"CCTV footage from the afternoon of 14 October, 2022 showed Benkired, then 24 years-old, approaching Lola after she returned home from school.According to reports, Benkired lured Lola into an apartment her older sister was sub-letting in the building.   Over an hour-and-a-half, Benkired subjected the 12-year-old to a sexual assault before attacking her with scissors and a box cutter.Benkired bound Lola with duct tape, including around her head, leading to her death by asphyxiation.As he read out the verdict, the presiding judge referred to the \"extreme cruelty of the criminal acts\" which he described as \"true torture\".\"In determining the appropriate sentence, the court took into account the unspeakable psychological damage to the victim and her family in such violent and almost unspeakable circumstances,\" he said.Benkired was in France on a student visa but had failed to renew it. In July 2022, she was stopped at an airport in Paris and was given 30 days to leave the country. Days after Lola's murder in October that year, Jordan Bardella, president of France's far-right National Rally party wrote on X that the woman \"had no business being in France\". Hard-right rival Éric Zemmour also took to social media to write: \"Lola's murderer should never have crossed her path.\"France's Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin criticised the \"indecency\" of politicians who, he said, \"should reflect on the consequences of their words\". Lola's mother and her father, Johan Daviet, denounced \"any use of the name and image of [our] child for political ends\".Mr Daviet died in 2024, aged 49.",

    "body": "11 hours agoJack BurgessGetty ImagesEcuador's president has said someone attempted to poison him by putting three highly concentrated toxic substances in gifts of chocolate and jam.Daniel Noboa said his team had proof to support the claim, though he has yet to publicly provide any evidence.The South American leader told CNN on Thursday that he believed it was \"practically impossible\" that the three chemicals would be found in high concentrations in the items by chance.His comments come in the wake of violent clashes in Ecuador over a sharp rise in fuel prices under his presidency. The centre-right politician has brought in military crackdowns on drug gangs, but has also faced accusations of targeting protesters.Noboa has denied the allegations of attempts on his life - the third in two months - were a means of portraying his detractors as violent.\"No one throws a Molotov cocktail at themselves... or poisons themselves with chocolate, or throws stones at themselves,\" he said, referring to previous incidents.Early in October, Ecuador's government said five people were detained over what it described as an alleged assassination attempt.About 500 people threw rocks at the president's car and there were \"signs of bullet damage\" on his vehicle, according to the country's energy and environment minister, who added that Noboa was unharmed.The BBC was not able to independently confirm that a bullet had been fired.The government also said that, in late September, a humanitarian convoy containing Noboa was attacked and 17 soldiers taken hostage.Ecuadorian officials said the convoy - which included UN and EU diplomats - was delivering aid to communities affected by a national strike when ambushed by about 350 people, who attacked it with Molotov cocktails.Noboa posted photos of smashed windscreens and windows on the cars on social media.A national strike protesting against the government ending diesel subsidies came to a close on Thursday after several weeks.The strike was declared by the country's largest Indigenous organisation - the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie) - with marches and roadblocks organised.The Conaie group led demonstrations that overthrew three presidents between 1997 and 2005.",

    "body": "5 hours agoRayhan DemytrieCaucasus correspondentGeorgia's former Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili has appeared in court charged with large-scale money laundering - a shocking turnaround for one of the most loyal allies of billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, widely seen as Georgia's de facto leader.Prosecutors said when his home was raided by investigators earlier this month they discovered $6.5m (£4.9m) in cash.Garibashvili, 43, twice served as prime minister during the Ivanishvili years – first from 2013-15 and then again from 2021 until January last year.Now he has pleaded guilty to corruption charges that could carry a 12-year jail term and he has been granted bail of one million Georgian lari ($368,000; £277,000).The charges against the former prime minister are the latest in a string of detentions of ex-government officials.But the case against Garibashvili is the first prosecution of a senior member of Georgia's governing elite, and it comes amid the ruling party's authoritarian pivot away from the West.While serving first as defence minister and then as prime minister between 2019 and 2024, he is alleged to have \"secretly and covertly engaged in various types of business activities and received a particularly large amount of income of illegal origin\".He is accused of laundering this income and falsely declaring money as gifts from family members.His lawyer, Amiran Giguashvili, confirmed his client was working with authorities.\"The court took into account that Mr Irakli agrees to the charges, does not hide from the investigation and co-operates,\" he told the BBC.The corruption case marks a dramatic fall for a politician who worked in Ivanishvili's companies before entering politics in 2011 as part of the billionaire's Georgian Dream party, which has been in power since 2012.In February 2014, he signed Georgia's Association Agreement with the European Union.However, in recent years he has led Georgia's shift away from the EU. He developed close ties with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and said Nato's enlargement was one of the main reasons for the war in Ukraine.According to Georgian political analyst Ghia Nodia, the former prime minister's downfall reflects Bidzina Ivanishvili's mistrust of his former political appointees.\"Ivanishvili is really the driver, he decided for some reason that there is some kind of treason in his team,\" Nodia said.\"At this point, he trusts [current PM Irakli] Kobakhidze but stopped trusting his closest lieutenant, not just Garibashvili, but also [ex-security chief] Liluashvili and others.\"Meanwhile, Georgia's political turmoil continues, a year after Georgian Dream won contested parliamentary elections which the then president refused to recognise.There have been daily protests since the government's announcement in November 2024 that it would halt membership talks with the EU, and most opposition leaders are now in jail.New legislations have targeted civil society, pro-opposition media, and journalists and activists have been imprisoned.\"Ivanishvili seems like [he's] under siege,\" says Ghia Nodia. \"He believes these crazy deep state conspiracies that the West wants to destroy him through these continuous protests in Georgia.\"",

    "body": "45 minutes agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporterOntario Premier Doug Ford has said he will pause his province's anti-tariff advertisement campaign in the US, after it prompted President Donald Trump to terminate trade talks.Ford said he made the decision after speaking to Prime Minister Mark Carney on Friday, adding that the TV spot will be paused on Monday \"so that trade talks can resume\". It will still run over the weekend on US networks, he said, including during the Major League Baseball World Series games.Carney told reporters earlier on Friday that Canada is prepared to resume trade talks with the US \"when the Americans are ready\".Trump criticised the advert late on Thursday night in a Truth Social post, calling it \"FAKE\" and \"egregious\". He said trade talks were \"HEREBY TERMINATED\".The advert, which was sponsored by the Ontario government, quotes former US President Ronald Reagan, a Republican and icon of US conservatism, saying tariffs \"hurt every American\".The video takes excerpts from a 1987 national radio address by Reagan that focused on foreign trade.Trump's termination of trade talks came after the Ronald Reagan Foundation, which is charged with preserving Reagan's legacy,  released a statement saying the advert had used \"selective\" audio and video of the former president's remarks.It accused the advert of misrepresenting Reagan's address, and said the Ontario government had not sought permission to use it.On Friday, Ford said the intention of the advert was \"to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build\" and the impact of tariffs.\"We've achieved our goal, having reached US audiences at the highest levels,\" Ford said.Earlier in the day, the Ontario premier shared the full 1987 radio address on free and fair trade by Reagan, saying that the former president knew Canada and the US \"were stronger together\".The US has imposed a 35% levy on all Canadian goods - though most are exempt under an existing free trade agreement. It has also slapped sector-specific levies on Canadian goods include a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.Those sector-specific tariffs have especially hurt Ontario, where the bulk of Canada's automanufacturing industry is based.Since his election earlier this year, Prime Minister Carney has attempted to strike a deal that would ease the tariffs. Three-quarters of Canadian exports are sold to the US, making its economy particularly vulnerable.",

    "body": "Luiz Inácio da Silva has announced he will run for a fourth term as Brazil's president in the nation's elections in 2026.The 79-year-old had indicated during his last election campaign that it would be his last - but stressed he did not feel his age in comments during a state visit to Indonesia on Thursday.\"I'm about to turn 80 years old, but you can be sure I have the same energy I had when I was 30. And I will run for a fourth term in Brazil,\" Lula told reporters.The decision to run comes despite Lula suffering health problems in office after winning in the tightest run-off election in the South American nation's history.Already Brazil's oldest president when inaugurated, in December last year he underwent surgery for a brain bleed caused by a blow to the head he sustained in a fall in the presidential palace.The left-wing leader beat then-incumbent Jair Bolsonaro by 51% to 49% in 2022.The right-wing former president is unlikely to be able to challenge Lula again, as he is serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a military coup aimed at keeping him in power after he lost the last election.The legal case which led to his lengthy sentence has drawn the ire of US President Donald Trump, prompting him to impose a 50% tariff on imports of Brazilian goods.However, the two described having a \"friendly\" call earlier in October as Lula seeks to reduce those levies, and are expected to meet on Sunday.Lula, who turns 80 on Monday, has himself been imprisoned - for 18 months on corruption charges - but was freed in 2018 after the case was overturned.He has hinted at a possible fourth run for president since returning to office, but had so far stopped short of a formal announcement.Brazil's constitution limits presidents to two consecutive terms. Lula previously served a two-term stint between 2003 and 2011.",

    "body": "7 hours agoDearbail JordanReutersForged art claiming to show works by famous artists, including Picasso and Rembrandt, has been seized by policeBavarian police have seized millions of euros worth of forged art claiming to show works by Picasso, Rembrandt and Kahlo in an operation spanning Germany, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Authorities in Bavaria said the main suspect is a 77-year-old German man who, along with 10 alleged accomplices, is facing charges of conspiracy and fraud.Investigators first became suspicious when the septuagenarian ringleader attempted to sell two supposedly original paintings by Picasso on the art market.He then wanted to sell De Staalmeesters, a famous oil painting by Dutch old master Rembrandt, for 120 million Swiss francs (£113m) - despite the original hanging in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.The Bavarian State Criminal Police Office (BLKA) said the forged De Staalmeesters - which is sometimes referred to as the Masters of the Clothmakers' Guild - was owned by an 84-year-old Swiss woman.She is now being investigated by the Amberg public prosecutor's office, the BLKA and Swiss authorities after the forged piece was confiscated in Switzerland.At the time, after being examined by an art expert, the police said: \"It was, as suspected, a copy and not a lost masterpiece by Rembrandt van Rijn.\"  The painting was seized during a co-ordinated series of dawn raids across Germany, Switzerland and Liechtenstein on Wednesday 15 October.During the searches, a large number of suspected art forgeries were found and seized, the BLKA said, along with \"documents, records, mobile phones, storage media and cloud data\".

They included copies of work by Mexican painter Frida Kahlo as well as Flemish old master Peter Paul Rubens, Italian sculptor Amedeo Modigliani and Spain's Joan Miró.He was assisted by 74-year-old German man who \"prepared expert reports specifically to confirm the authenticity of the artworks\".The BLKA said that he and the main suspect were arrested on the day of the raids before being conditionally released.The police said that the investigation is in progress.\"Among other things, all confiscated paintings will be examined in detail by experts and appraisers in the coming weeks,\" police said.",

On Friday, a judge set a trial date of 26 January.The federal government alleges James bought a three-bedroom home in Norfolk using a mortgage loan that required her to use the property as her secondary residence, and did not allow for shared ownership or \"timesharing\" of the home.The indictment claims the property \"was not occupied or used\" by James as a secondary residence, but instead was \"used as a rental investment property\" and was being rented to a family of three.The \"misrepresentation\" allowed James to obtain favourable loan terms that would not have been available for an investment property, prosecutors claim.Sources have told US media that James bought the home for her great-niece in 2020 and that the relative never paid rent for the home. James' legal team also said in court filings this week that they plan to challenge the appointment of US attorney Lindsey Halligan to James' case. Trump appointed Ms Halligan, his former personal attorney, to oversee the case after another US prosecutor, Erik Siebert, resigned. Siebert reportedly was ousted after he told the justice department he had not found sufficient evidence to charge James.James' attorneys also are filing a motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that it is \"vindictive\". She is one of several Trump critics who are under investigation or have faced criminal charges in recent weeks. The justice department charged Trump's former Federal Bureau of Investigation director James Comey with making false statements to Congress. Trump's former national security adviser, John Bolton, is charged with sending and wilfully retaining national defence information.Trump last month called on his social media site Truth Social for Attorney General Pam Bondi, to bring charges against his political opponents. \"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" he wrote.James brought a civil fraud case against Trump and his company, the Trump Organization, in 2022. Trump was later found liable of falsifying records to secure better loan deals, leading to a $500m (£376m) fine. The penalty was thrown out by an appeals court, which called the fine excessive, though it upheld that Trump was liable for fraud.",

    "body": "A German company inadvertently embroiled in the Louvre Museum heist after one of its lifts was used in the theft is making the most of its free publicity - by launching a new advertising campaign.Werne-based firm Böcker this week published a social media post featuring the now-famous image of its furniture ladder extending up to a balcony outside the Gallery of Apollo. \"When you need to move fast,\" reads a banner under the image. \"The Böcker Agilo transports your treasures weighing up to 400kg at 42m/min - quiet as a whisper.\"Video has emerged of the alleged thieves escaping on the mechanical ladder after stealing €88m worth (£76m; $102m) of France's crown jewels on Sunday.The company's managing director, Alexander Böcker, told news agency AFP on Wednesday that, when it became clear no one was injured in the heist, it had used \"a touch of humour\" to draw attention to the family-run business.\"The crime is, of course, absolutely reprehensible, that's completely clear to us,\" Mr Böcker said.\"It was... an opportunity for us to use the most famous and most visited museum in the world to get a little attention for our company.\" How Louvre gang carried out France's most shocking theftStolen Louvre jewellery worth €88m, prosecutor saysCan France retrieve its priceless crown jewels - or is it too late?Reaction to Böcker's new campaign has been enthusiastic, with responses on social media including \"marketing genius\" and \"excellent, that is German quality\".\"Your messaging takes the crown,\" one commenter quipped.Mr Böcker told AFP that he recognised his company's device from news reports, saying the machine was sold \"a few years ago to a French customer who rents this type of equipment in Paris and the surrounding area\".The alleged jewel thieves had arranged to have the machine demonstrated to them last week and had stolen it during the demonstration, he said.The thieves arrived at the Louvre on Sunday shortly after the museum opened its doors.Within eight minutes, they had made off with some of France's most valuable treasures, including those belonging to former royalty and imperial rulers.Among the eight items stolen were diadems, necklaces, earrings and brooches adorned with thousands of diamonds and other precious gemstones.The Louvre reopened on Wednesday, a few days after what has been called France's most shocking theft.The museum's director admitted on Wednesday that security failed to spot the gang early enough to stop the theft and that CCTV around its perimeter was weak and \"aging\".\"We failed these jewels,\" Laurence des Cars said, adding that no-one was protected from \"brutal criminals - not even the Louvre\".\"We've had a terrible failure at the Louvre. I've taken responsibility for it,\" she added.Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez told France's Europe1 radio that he had \"every confidence\" the thieves would be caught.Prosecutors said they believed the robbers acted under orders from a criminal organisation.",

    "body": "4 hours agoHugo Bachega,Middle East correspondent  , Jerusalem and Raffi Berg,LondonUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said \"a lot of countries\" have offered to be part of an international security force for Gaza - a key part of President Donald Trump's peace plan - but added Israel would have to be comfortable with participants.Speaking on a visit to Israel, Rubio said talks on forming the International Stabilization Force (ISF) were continuing and that it would come into effect \"as soon as it possibly can\".It remained unclear, however, how such a force could be deployed without an understanding with Hamas.He said the Israel-Hamas ceasefire had made \"historic\" progress since it began two weeks ago, but warned to expect \"ups and downs and twists and turns\".\"There is no plan B,\" he said. \"This is the best plan. It's the only plan. And it's one that we think can succeed.\" Rubio said conditions had to be created \"so that never again will we see what happened on 7 October, so that you can actually be in a place [Gaza] that no longer has elements operating within it that are a threat to Israel or to their own people for that matter\".The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken to Gaza as hostages.At least 68,280 Palestinians have been killed by the Israel military campaign that followed, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the United Nations as reliable.Rubio said Hamas will be disarmed, as required by Trump's plan. \"If Hamas refuses to demilitarise, it'll be a violation of the agreement and that'll have to be enforced,\" he said.\"Hamas cannot govern and cannot be involved in governing the future of Gaza,\" he added.Rubio's visit caps a week in which senior American officials, including Vice-President JD Vance, came to Israel. It's a sign that Washington is determined to make Trump's plan for Gaza succeed and is concerned that actions by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government might collapse it. In Israeli media, the effort has been described as \"Bibi-sitting\", a play with the prime minister's nickname.In recent days, multiple reports have suggested the White House's frustration with the Israeli government, fuelled by the military's deadly response to an attack it blamed on Hamas in Gaza last weekend and the vote in the Israeli parliament towards the annexation of the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, while Vance was visiting.The Israeli Haaretz newspaper reported that American officials said they would \"not tolerate any surprises from Israel that could jeopardise the ceasefire\", and that they were expecting advance notice from Israel before any strikes in Gaza. \"In practice,\" the report said, \"the US [was] taking over certain security authorities from Israel\".In public, Netanyahu, whose coalition relies on the support of ultra-nationalist ministers, has rejected reports that Washington is making decisions on Israel's behalf, describing the country's relationship as a partnership. The apparent pressure from the country's most important ally, at a time when Israel faces unprecedented isolation, risks derailing his strategy to frame the war in Gaza as a victory at home. This narrative will be essential in the campaign for the next parliamentary election, which should be held by October 2026.Both Rubio and Vance tried to strike a positive tone in their public statements – both said they were optimistic the ceasefire would hold – while also acknowledging that the negotiations over the remaining points would be difficult and long. Those issues include the scale of the Israeli withdrawal, the future governance of Gaza and the formation of the ISF, as well as the disarmament by Hamas, and they offered no indication of how those talks would proceed.Rubio said there were \"a lot of countries\" that offered to take part in the ISF. \"Obviously, as you put together this force, it'll have to be people that Israel's comfortable, or countries that Israel's comfortable with as well,\" he added, without elaborating.This appeared to be a reference to Turkey, which has become a major player in the negotiations, amid reports Israel has vetoed the country's involvement.The scope of the ISF's mission remains unclear, as countries appear to be concerned with the possibility that its forces might end up confronting Hamas fighters if there is no agreement with the group over the ISF deployment.Seeing the peace plan through is \"not going to be an easy ride\", Rubio said. \"There are going to be bumps along the road, but we have to make it work.\"",

    "body": "US deploys world's largest warship in escalation of drug trafficking campaign53 minutes agoKayla Epstein and Josh Cheetham,BBC VerifyGetty ImagesThe USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, the world's largest, can carry up to 90 aircraftThe US is deploying the world's largest warship towards the Caribbean, marking a major escalation in its campaign to target drug traffickers in the region.Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, which can carry up to 90 aircraft, to move from the Mediterranean to the waters off Latin America on Friday.The US has been increasing its military presence in the Caribbean in recent weeks, which now includes eight other warships, a nuclear submarine and F-35 aircraft.It has carried out airstrikes on boats it says belong to drug traffickers, including on Friday when Hegseth said \"six male narco-terrorists\" had been killed.That operation took place in the Caribbean Sea, against a ship Hegseth said belonged to the Tren de Aragua criminal organisation. Hegseth posted a video on X showing the strike. It begins by showing a boat in crosshairs before it explodes into a cloud of smoke.Meanwhile, the Pentagon said the USS Gerald R Ford carrier would deploy to the US Southern Command area of responsibility, which includes Central America and South America as well as the Caribbean. The additional forces \"will enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle TCOs\", or transnational criminal organisations, spokesman Sean Parnell said.The carrier last publicly transmitted its location three days ago off the coast of Croatia, in the Adriatic Sea.Its deployment marks a significant escalation in the US military buildup in the region. It is also likely to increase tensions with Venezuela, whose government Washington has long accused of harbouring drug traffickers.The carrier's large aircraft load can include jets and planes for transport and reconnaissance. Its first long-term deployment was in 2023.It is unclear which vessels will accompany the carrier when it moves to the region, but it can operate as part of a strike group that includes destroyers carrying missiles and other equipment.Pete Hegseth on XThe US said it had destroyed a drug trafficking boat earlier on FridayThe US has carried out a series of strikes on boats in recent weeks, in what President Donald Trump has described as an effort to curtail drug trafficking.The strike announced on Friday was the 10th tenth the Trump administration has carried out against alleged drug traffickers since early September. Most have taken place off of South America, in the Caribbean, but on 21 and 22 October it carried out strikes in the Pacific Ocean.Members of US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have raised concerns about the legality of the strikes and the president's authority to order them.On 10 September, 25 Democratic US senators wrote to the White House and alleged the administration had struck a vessel days earlier \"without evidence that the individuals on the vessel and the vessel's cargo posed a threat to the United States\".Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican, has argued that such strikes require congressional approval.Trump said he has the legal authority to order the strikes, and has designated Tren de Aragua a terrorist organisation.\"We're allowed to do that, and if we do [it] by land, we may go back to Congress,\" Trump told White House reporters on Wednesday.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio added that \"if people want to stop seeing drug boats blow up, stop sending drugs to the United States\".The six deaths in the operation Hegseth announced on Friday brings the total people killed in the US strikes to at least 43.Analysts suggest the strikes are not only about drug trafficking but also about putting military pressure on the government of President Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela.He is a longtime foe of Trump who has long accused him of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organisation, which he denies.",

    "body": "1 hour agoJaroslav Lukiv and Vitaliy Shevchenko,Russia editor at Downing StreetEPA/ShutterstockMore than 20 nations supporting Ukraine have pledged to \"take Russian oil and gas off the global market\" as part of efforts to pressure President Vladimir Putin to end the war.\"We're choking off funding for Russia's war machine,\" said UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, after hosting a summit of the \"coalition of the willing\" in London.The UK and US have in recent days sanctioned Russia's two biggest oil companies, while the EU targeted Moscow's liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was also in London, said \"pressure\" on Russia was the only way to stop the fighting. However, no long-range missile deliveries to Ukraine were announced at the summit.Zelensky has long argued that US-made Tomahawks and European missiles would help make the war costs heavier for Moscow by hitting key military targets - including oil refineries and weapons depots - deep inside Russia.But during last week's talks in Washington, US President Donald Trump indicated to Zelensky that he was not ready to supply Tomahawks.On Thursday, President Putin warned that if \"such weapons are used to strike Russian Federation territory the response will be... overwhelming\".Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Speaking at a joint press conference after the London summit, Starmer said Putin was \"not serious about peace\", and therefore Ukraine's allies agreed a \"clear plan for the rest of the year\" on supporting Ukraine.The UK prime minister said this also included targeting Russia's sovereign assets to \"unlock billions to help finance Ukraine's defence\". He gave no further details.On Thursday, EU leaders agreed to help support Ukraine's \"financial needs\" for the next two years - but stopped short of agreeing to use frozen Russian assets worth €140bn (£122bn).Asked about a so-called \"reparations loan\" for Ukraine funded by the Russian assets, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she hoped a decision would be made by Christmas EveIn London, the \"coalition of the willing\" also pledged to strengthen Ukraine's air defences\" amid almost daily Russian air assaults on Ukrainian civilians and energy infrastructure.Zelensky warned that Russia \"wants to make the winter cold a tool of torment\", adding that \"they want to break us\".Comments by the leaders in London will be disappointing for those who were hoping to hear specific examples of how Ukraine's allies were planning to make Russia stop attacking Ukraine.No doubt, a lot of the words said will be pleasing to the Ukrainian ear. For example, Starmer said the UK and Ukraine's other allies were prepared to ratchet up pressure on Moscow.But there were no concrete examples of how exactly the allies were planning to force a change on the battlefield or make Putin come to the negotiating table.EPA/ShutterstockUkrainian officials say a kindergarten was hit in a Russian air strike on the north-eastern city of Kharkiv earlier this weekOver in Ukraine, several people who spoke to the BBC said they were more focused on everyday problems, rather than following Zelensky's trip to the UK.Yana Kolomiets, from Odesa, said there was a lack of electricity, heating and water in the southern city.\"The more scary thing is that the Russians started launching guided bombs on our region,\" she added.Tetiana Dankevych, from the capital Kyiv, said power outages and a problems with water supplies caused by Russian strikes were making life \"very difficult\".\"I don't have a feeling this war will end soon,\" she said.Further support for Ukraine's energy infrastructure was among the issues discussed at the London summit - however, no specific announcements were made.Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte also took part in the London meeting, while other leaders - including French President Emmanuel Macron - participated via a video link.Ukraine and its Western allies have publicly agreed with President Trump's proposal that the fighting should be immediately frozen along the vast front line for negotiations to begin.Russia has rejected this idea, repeating demands that Kyiv and its allies describe as de facto capitulation by Ukraine.Earlier on Friday, Zelensky held talks with King Charles at Windsor - their third meeting this year.",

    "body": "3 hours agoMallory MoenchStandWithUsMichael Smuss in an updated handout photoMichael Smuss, a survivor of the Warsaw Ghetto in Poland who resisted the Nazis, has died aged 99 in Israel. He joined the ghetto uprising as a teenager in 1943, helping to make petrol bombs. Taken prisoner, he survived concentration camps and a death march before the end of World War II. After the war, he became an artist and Holocaust educator. The embassies of Germany and Poland in Israel paid tribute to him on social media. \"He repeatedly risked his life during the Holocaust, fighting for survival and helping other prisoners in the Warsaw Ghetto – even after he was captured by the Nazis and deported to concentration camps,\" the German embassy stated on X.The Polish embassy said Smuss \"lectured youth on the history of Polish Jews and expressed his memories through art. His legacy endures.\"The Polish embassy and the Holocaust Educational Trust, a UK charity, called Smuss the last surviving fighter of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. However, in 2018, Israeli officials and international media, including the BBC, reported that Simcha Rotem, who had just died aged 94, was the last surviving fighter of the uprising.Last month, Germany's ambassador to Israel awarded Smuss with the German Federal Cross of Merit, in recognition of his contribution to Holocaust education and promoting dialogue between the two countries, the embassy said.\"Thousands of people, especially young people in Germany, have learned from his testimonies.\"German Embassy in IsraelThe German ambassador to Israel awarded a medal to Michael Smuss in SeptemberSmuss was born in 1926 in the Free City of Danzig, a city-state that is now Gdansk, Poland. He later moved to Lodz before being deported to the Warsaw Ghetto with his father.Hundreds of thousands of Jews were crammed into the ghetto, where they faced poverty, starvation, disease and cold.Since Smuss spoke German, he was taken outside to work in a factory repairing and repainting helmets, he recounted in a video recorded for the Sumter Museum in the US in 2022.He joined the Jewish Resistance in the ghetto, and he and others started stealing as much paint thinner as possible to make petrol bombs.\"We filled up bottles which were put up on the roofs of all the houses close to the entrance of the ghetto with the expectation that once they're going to come, we'd be throwing them down\", he said.On 19 April the Nazis came to empty the ghetto, an enclave in Warsaw created by the Nazis to segregate and persecute Jews. The resistance fought back with weapons they had exchanged for warm clothes from Italian soldiers who had been sent from Africa to the Russian front.The resistance, which Smuss called \"the greatest uprising in this war against Germany\", lasted 28 days.\"It was very rough... no shower, no food. They were burning up, liquidating one house after another, full of smoke burning in your eyes,\" he said.He described thousands of bodies lying in front of houses and \"the smell of gas and decomposed bodies\".He, among some others, was taken prisoner on 29 April.Corbis via Getty ImagesMichael Smuss, identified by The Jerusalem Post as fourth from left, taken prisoner after the Warsaw Ghetto UprisingThey were put on a train to the Treblinka extermination camp. As he witnessed people dying on the journey, \"my heart became a stone\", he said.Along the way, the train was stopped by employers looking to retrieve workers that had been taken from their factories. Another German came looking for experienced workers, and Smuss offered himself and those he knew.\"When we left on the train to Treblinka, I was sure that my life was over,\" he told The Jerusalem Post earlier this year. \"But when the train came to a halt, I felt with all of my being that on this day I was not going to die.\"He was moved and endured forced labour at other camps, and finally a death march to Dachau, before his Nazi captors fled incoming American troops.He told The Jerusalem Post that his father was killed trying to escape one camp, while his mother and sister, who had been able to stay in Lodz, survived.Smuss initially returned to Poland, but then moved to the US, where he worked, studied and started a family. After experiencing trauma symptoms, he moved to Israel in 1979 alone to seek help, where he took up art and educating others about the Holocaust. He is survived by his wife.",

    "body": "5 hours agoAbdishukri HaybeBBC Somali, NairobiA Kenyan family has told the BBC how a cheetah cub they adopted after finding it lying next to its dead mother became almost like one of their children.However, their neighbours in the northern Wajir county were not pleased to see a wild animal being raised so close to them.\"Many people immediately told us to get rid of the cub so it wouldn't harm the livestock. We didn't do that because it seemed unreasonable,\" Bisharo Abdirahman Omar said.The reaction was unsurprising as the Somali-speaking nomadic community earn their living by raising livestock, which are often threatened by predators such as cheetahs, leopards, lions, and hyenas.\"We knew it wouldn't benefit us in any way, like livestock would,\" said Rashid Abdi Hussein, a 45-year-old father of 10.\"But I decided that since people are killing these animals, maybe we should raise them instead and be different.\"The family cared for the cub for two years and three months, during which it became an inseparable part of the family.\"The animal was troublesome at first, but in the end, it became tame and became one of the children,\" he said.The family fed the cub milk through a syringe at first, then meat when it was old enough.\"We have made a big sacrifice - since the day I rescued it, I have slaughtered 15 sheep to feed the cheetah,\" Mr Hussein told the BBC.The family have been praised by the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) for their generosity in looking after an animal which is often killed or trafficked.Sharmaarke Mohamed, head of the Northeastern Conservancy Association (NECA), says cheetahs and wildlife across north-eastern Kenya are facing a growing crisis that has gone largely unnoticed.\"Cheetahs are currently facing a very grave threat, along with many other wild animals,\" he said.\"This young cheetah that was recently found was most likely orphaned, its mother was either killed or poisoned,\" he said.According to the Cheetah Conservation Fund, the smuggling of baby cheetahs is widespread in the region, with active trafficking routes running through northern Kenya, eastern Ethiopia, and Somalia.The organization estimates that between 200 and 300 cheetah cubs are smuggled out of the Horn of Africa each year, many of which are transported to Yemen and then distributed across the Gulf States to be illegally sold as pets.Ms Omar said the family were approached by people who wanted to buy the young cheetah but they refused to sell it.\"While we were taking care of it, there were people who offered us money. Some even said they would pay 20,000 Kenyan shillings ($155; £115),\" she told the BBC.\"Others suggested we trade it for goats, but we refused because it had become part of the family.\"While KWS praised the family for looking after the cheetah, it pointed out that keeping wild animals as pets is against the law.\"We deeply appreciate the Good Samaritan's compassion and remind all Kenyans that true coexistence means protecting wildlife,\" the agency said.The young cheetah is now being taken care of at the Nairobi Safari Walk.",

    "body": "16 hours agoJessica ParkerBerlin correspondentBBCA BBC investigation last year found that Germany was being used to store boats and engines used in small-boat crossingsThere are growing doubts that Germany will tighten its laws this year to make it easier to prosecute small-boat smugglers, the BBC has learned.Facilitating people-smuggling is not technically illegal in Germany if it is to a third country, which the UK is after Brexit.Germany has agreed to close the loophole by the end of 2025.But now the Interior Ministry in Berlin says only that it intends to introduce the bill to the German parliament, or Bundestag, by that date – and has stopped short of guaranteeing a timeline for its final approval.A spokesperson would not be drawn on whether time was running out ahead of the Christmas break – but told the BBC that the federal government had \"no influence\" over parliamentary process once a bill had been agreed by cabinet.Some UK officials are increasingly unsure whether enough space is left in the Bundestag's calendar this year, though the Home Office insists it has not been told of any setbacks by Berlin.A staffer at the Bundestag, who is tracking the proposal, said there may \"theoretically\" be a sufficient window but admitted it did not appear to be a government priority.It comes as France is backing away from a recent commitment to intervene more forcefully at sea to stop small boats,  according to multiple sources contacted by the BBC.France retreats from pledge to intercept migrant boatsThe UK's Labour government is under pressure to show that its emphasis on closer international collaboration – striking deals with other countries – can work as an effective strategy to tackle small boat crossings.Last year, a BBC investigation exposed how Germany is used as a hub by small-boat smugglers to store dinghies that are then used for illegal English Channel crossings.‘Death trap’ Channel boats traded by smugglers in German city - BBC undercoverBerlin's subsequent commitment to adapt the law – and make such activities more explicitly illegal – was lauded as \"further evidence\" by the UK that its approach was \"bearing fruit\".Any delay is likely to spark frustration in the UK, as it has long pressed Berlin to tighten its rules and enforcement.STEFAN ROUSSEAU/POOL/AFPSir Keir Starmer (L) and Germany's Friedrich Merz signed a landmark treaty last JulyA legal provision has been drafted to further expand \"criminal liability for cross-border human smuggling to the United Kingdom\", according to the Interior Ministry in Berlin.However, the ministry has not confirmed that the plans have yet to be approved by Cabinet - a necessary step before being laid before parliament.The proposals are not widely known about in Germany, where the domestic debate focuses on internal levels of immigration.There is also some scepticism in Berlin about how much difference the law change will make in meeting UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's repeated pledge to \"smash the gangs\".Germany's announcement that it would change the law nearly a year ago came just months after the BBC's investigation.The following July, alongside a landmark treaty, the UK and Germany said that the aim was to for the Bundestag to adopt the legislation by the end of 2025.Chancellor Friedrich Merz told the BBC at the time that he believed that not much time would be needed to enact the change after the summer recess.It will give German prosecutors \"more tools to tackle the supply and storage of dangerous small boats equipment\", according to the UK government.Currently, investigators have to rely on \"collateral crime\" such as violence or money laundering – or have used judicial orders from other countries to carry out raids.A UK Home Office spokesperson said: \"We welcome the commitment from Germany to make it illegal to facilitate illegal migration to the UK.\"\"The law change is expected to be adopted by the end of the year,\" they said, while adding that the process was a matter for the German government.",

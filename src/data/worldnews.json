    "body": "The Spanish town of Terrassa in north-eastern Catalonia has temporarily banned the adoption of black cats from animal shelters to prevent potentially sinister \"rituals\" during Halloween.All requests for the fostering or adoption of the felines will be denied from 6 October to 10 November to protect them from being hurt or used as props, said the local animal welfare service. Deputy Mayor Noel Duque told broadcaster RTVE that adoption requests for black cats usually increase around Halloween.While black cats are often associated with witchcraft and seen as bad luck in Western culture, many other cultures, including Japan and Egypt, see them as symbols of prosperity and fortune.Terassa's city council said there had been no record of cruelty towards black cats in the town, however there have been incidents in other areas and the decision was taken after warnings from animal welfare groups.\"We try to prevent people from adopting because it's trendy or impulsively. And in cases like these, which we know exist, to prevent any macabre practices,\" Duque said.Terrassa is home to more than 9,800 cats, according to local authorities, and the town's adoption centre houses around 100 felines, 12 of which are black, the Catalan News Agency reported.The city council emphasised that the measure is \"temporary and exceptional\" and represents an extra precaution for animal welfare, but did not rule out repeating the ban in the future.Exceptions during the ban period will be assessed individually by the adoption centre and normal fostering requests will resume after Halloween.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump has said the US will return two people who survived a strike on what he called a \"drug-carrying submarine\" to their countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia.Writing on social media, Trump said two other people were killed in the US strike on the vessel, which he said US intelligence confirmed was \"loaded up with mostly Fentanyl, and other illegal narcotics\". The attack on Thursday is at least the sixth US strike on ships in the Caribbean Sea in recent weeks. It is the first time survivors have been reported.At least 27 people were killed in the prior five boat strikes in the waters off Venezuela, according to figures released by the administration.The two survivors were rescued by a US military helicopter and then shuttled onto a US warship in the Caribbean, unnamed US officials told US media earlier. On Saturday evening, Colombian President Gustavo Petro wrote on X: \"We received the Colombian detained in the narco submarine; we are glad that he is alive and he will be processed in accordance with the laws.\"BBC SOUNDS: Why has Trump authorised CIA action in Venezuela?In recent weeks, Trump has ramped up threats against Venezuela's leadership over claims that the country is sending drugs to the US. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused Trump of trying to make the South American nation \"an American colony\".Trump has defended the ongoing boat attacks, saying they are aimed at stemming the flow of drugs from Latin America into the US, but his government has not provided evidence or details about the identities of the vessels or those on board.\"It was my great honor to destroy a very large DRUG-CARRYING SUBMARINE that was navigating towards the United States on a well known narcotrafficking transit route,\" Trump said in his Truth Social post on Saturday.\"The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution.\"He added that no US military personnel were injured in the attack. On Friday, the US president had said the submarine targeting the latest attack was \"built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs\". \"This was not an innocent group of people. I don't know too many people who have submarines, and that was an attack on a drug-carrying, loaded submarine,\" he added.UN-appointed human rights experts have described the US strikes as \"extrajudicial executions\".Trump earlier told reporters that he had authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, and that he was considering launching attacks on Venezuelan soil.Narco-subs have become a popular way to transport drugs as they can go largely undetected, and can be sunk after delivery. They are often homemade and constructed using fibreglass and plywood. The US, as well as other coastal nations, have previously intercepted some of these subs.",

    "body": "Baek Se-hee, the South Korean author of the bestselling memoir I Want to Die but I Want To Eat Tteokbokki has died at the age of 35.Her 2018 book, a compilation of conversations with her psychiatrist about her depression, was a cultural phenomenon with its themes of mental health resonating with readers across the world.Originally written in Korean, it found international acclaim after its English translation was published in 2022.The details surrounding her death are unclear.Baek donated her organs - her heart, lungs, liver and kidneys - which have helped to save five lives, the Korean Organ Donation Agency said in a statement on Friday.The statement also included comments from her sister, which said that Baek had wanted to \"share her heart with others through her work, and to inspire hope\".I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki, published in 2018, has sold more than a million copies worldwide and been translated in 25 countries.The runaway bestseller was celebrated for normalising mental health conversations and its nuanced take on inner struggles - most notably, the author's personal conflict between depressive thoughts and her appreciation for simple joys.\"The human heart, even when it wants to die, quite often wants at the same time to eat some tteokbokki, too,\" goes the book's most famous line. Tteokbokki, which are tubular chewy rice cakes usually eaten with a spicy sauce or stew, is a popular snack in Korean cuisine.Born in 1990, Baek Se-hee took creative writing in university and worked for five years at a publishing house, according to her short biography on Bloomsbury Publishing, which produced the English version of her 2018 memoir.Anton Hur, who had translated Baek's book into English, wrote on Instagram that her organs have saved five people but \"her readers will know she touched yet millions of lives more with her writing\".\"My thoughts are with her family,\" he wrote.For a decade she received treatment for dysthymia, a mild but long-lasting type of depression, which formed the basis of her bestseller, said her Bloomsbury bio.A sequel, I Want to Die but I Still Want to Eat Tteokbokki, was published in Korean in 2019. Its English translation was published in 2024.Tributes have poured in on social media. \"Rest softly,\" reads a comment on Baek's Instagram page. \"Thank you for saving us with your honesty.\"Another Instagram user said each time they read Baek's memoir they found \"deep comfort in every sentence and grew alongside it\". \"To create a single book that can lift people up... is no easy task, and I have indescribable respect for you for achieving that,\" they wrote.A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line.

    "body": "The US State Department says it has \"credible reports\" that Hamas is planning an \"imminent\" attack on civilians in Gaza, which it says would violate the ceasefire agreement.A statement released on Saturday said a planned attack against Palestinians would be a \"direct and grave\" violation of the ceasefire agreement and \"undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts\".The state department did not not provide further details on the attack and it is unclear what reports it was citing.The first phase of the ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel is currently in progress - all living hostages have been released and bodies of the deceased are still being returned to Israel.Also part of the agreement, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Washington said it had already informed other guarantors of the Gaza peace agreement - which include Egypt, Qatar and Turkey - and demanded Hamas uphold its end of the ceasefire terms. \"Should Hamas proceed with this attack, measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire,\" the statement said.Hamas has not yet commented on the statement.President Donald Trump has previously warned Hamas against the killing of civilians. \"If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social earlier this week.He later clarified that he would not be sending US troops into Gaza.Last week, BBC Verify authenticated graphic videos that showed a public execution carried out by Hamas gunmen in Gaza.The videos showed several men with guns line up eight people, whose arms were tied behind their backs, before killing them in a crowded square.BBC Verify could not confirm the identity of the masked gunmen, though some appeared to be wearing the green headbands associated with Hamas.On Saturday, Israel said it had received two more bodies from Gaza that Hamas said are hostages, though they have yet to be formally identified.So far, the remains of 10 out of 28 deceased hostages had been returned to Israel.Separately on Saturday, 11 members of one Palestinian family were killed by an Israeli tank shell, according to the Hamas-run civil defence ministry, in what was the deadliest single incident involving Israeli soldiers in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire.The Israeli military said soldiers had fired at a \"suspicious vehicle\" that had crossed the so-called yellow line demarcating the area still occupied by Israeli forces in Gaza.There are no physical markers of this line, and it is unclear if the bus did cross it. The BBC has asked the IDF for the coordinates of the incident.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 68,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.In September, a UN commission of inquiry said Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel categorically rejected the report as \"distorted and false\".",

    "body": "Israel's military has confirmed that the latest remains handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza and returned to Israel are those of a dead hostage. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the returned hostage is Eliyahu Margalit, 75, who was killed on 7 October and his body taken into Gaza from Nir Oz kibbutz.Mr Margalit, who was known to his family and friends as Churchill, is the 10th dead hostage to be returned from Gaza. The remains of another 18 people have yet to be repatriated. The bodies of 15 Palestinians were handed over by Israel via the Red Cross to officials in Gaza on Saturday, the Hamas-run health ministry said, bringing the total number of bodies it has received to 135.Israel's Hostages and Missing Families Forum described Mr Margalit in a statement as \"a cowboy at heart\" who managed a cattle branch and horse stables at Nir Oz for many years.His death was announced by Israel in December 2023, a month after his daughter Nili - who was also taken hostage - was released during a temporary truce.There has been fury in Israel that Hamas has not returned all of the bodies, in line with last week's ceasefire deal - though the US has downplayed the suggestion it amounts to a breach.On Friday night, the IDF again stressed that Hamas must \"uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages\".Hamas has blamed Israel for making the task difficult because Israeli strikes have reduced so many buildings to rubble and it does not allow heavy machinery and diggers into Gaza to be able to search for the hostages' bodies. UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told the BBC News Channel that the Gaza Strip \"is now a wasteland\", with people picking through the rubble for bodies and trying to find their homes - many of which have been flattened.He added that aid agencies have \"an enormous job ahead of us to stabilise the situation, to stop the starvation, to get the hospitals open, to get the kids back in school\".\"We've started to do that and we're having an impact already but being here on the ground, it's an overwhelming task,\" he said, speaking from Gaza City.BBC Verify - Aid group suspends Gaza operations after ceasefireUS plays down claims Hamas is violating ceasefire dealAs part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.After Hamas said it was unable to retrieve all the bodies, two senior Trump advisers said preparations to move to the next phase of the ceasefire deal were continuing.The advisers told reporters that the US government did not so far believe that Hamas had broken the agreement by not retrieving more remains, and said the group had acted in good faith by sharing information with interlocutors.While the full text of the agreement between Israel and Hamas has not been made public, a leaked version which appeared in Israeli media appeared to allow for the possibility that not all of the bodies would be immediately accessible.Several Palestinians have been reported killed since the ceasefire came into effect. Gaza's Civil Defence, run by Hamas, said on Saturday it had recovered nine bodies all from the same family after a bus was targeted by the IDF in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City, in the north, on Friday. It said 11 people were killed in total. The IDF said a \"suspicious vehicle was identified crossing the yellow line and approaching IDF troops operating in the northern Gaza Strip\" on Friday, prompting it to fire \"warning shots\" towards the vehicle. It said the vehicle \"continued to approach the troops in a way that caused an imminent threat to them\" and \"troops opened fire to remove the threat, in accordance with the agreement\".The IDF has warned Palestinians from entering areas in Gaza still under its control - though the line is not clearly demarcated. The Israeli military continues to operate in more than half of the Gaza Strip, under the terms of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement. Under the next stages of the ceasefire, troops are expected to pull out further. Speaking about his role in brokering the ceasefire, US special envoy Steve Witkoff told CBS News's 60 Minutes programme that President Donald Trump had felt \"like the Israelis were getting a little bit out of control in what they were doing\" after it targeted Hamas leaders in an air strike in Qatar in September. Following the strike in Doha, in which five lower-level Hamas members and a Qatari officer were killed, Witkoff said Trump had felt \"it was time to be very strong and stop them [Israel] from doing things that he felt were not in their long-term interests\".Witkoff, who led the US team at the talks alongside Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, said they had felt \"a little bit betrayed\" by the Israeli move.\"We had lost the confidence of the Qataris. And so Hamas went underground, and it was very, very difficult to get to them,\" Witkoff told the US network.Qatar, a key US ally, has played an important mediating role in ceasefire negotiations between Hamas and Israel.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 67,900 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.",

Ohtani also became the first pitcher since the Boston Braves' Jim Tobin in 1942 to hit three home runs in the same game.\"It was really fun on both sides of the ball today,\" said Ohtani, who was awarded the Most Valuable Player award for his heroics.\"I'm taking this trophy and let's get four more wins. We won it as a team and this is really a team effort. I hope everybody in LA and Japan and all over the world could enjoy a really good sake [Japanese rice wine].\"Ohtani's entered the game at the Dodger Stadium on the back of an eight-game home run drought, but led from the front as he struck out three batters in the opening frame.He then starred with the bat in a performance which included a crushing 446 foot home run and a monster 469 foot hit which bounced out of the stadium.It marked another historic showing from Ohtani, who last year became the first player ever to record 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in the same season.\"That was probably the greatest post-season performance of all time,\" said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts. \"There's a reason why he's the greatest player on the planet. It's kind of whatever you don't expect, expect him to do it.\"This is just a performance that I've just never seen. No-one's ever seen something like this. I'm still in awe right now of Shohei.\"The Dodgers' comfortable victory sets up a World Series showdown against the Toronto Blue Jays or Seattle Mariners, with the latter 3-2 up in the best-of-seven series.",

    "body": "1 day agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent in WarsawOmar Marques/Getty ImagesVolodymyr Zhuravlyov was released after the judge delivered his verdictA Polish judge has refused to extradite a Ukrainian citizen – suspected by Germany of sabotaging the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September 2022 – arguing that if Ukraine was responsible for the attack, then it was a \"just\" act.Volodymyr Zhuravlyov, who was brought to Warsaw District Court in handcuffs, was detained in Poland last month on a European arrest warrant.Judge Dariusz Lubowski ordered his release, after a ruling that was met with a ripple of surprise from the crowd in court and a smile from the man in the dock.Mr Zhuravlyov, along with others, is suspected of planting explosives deep beneath the Baltic Sea on the pipelines leading from Russia to Germany.Blame for the blasts, which crippled a long-controversial energy supply line from Russia to Germany, initially focused on Moscow until signs of Ukrainian involvement began to emerge. Officials in Kyiv have repeatedly denied any role.Extradition cases within the EU are usually quick and straightforward, but the Nord Stream case is proving to be very different.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, whose government is a key ally of war-torn Ukraine, immediately posted on X that the ruling was right. \"Case closed,\" he wrote.Diver held in Poland over Russian pipeline blasts in Baltic SeaUkrainian held in Italy over Nord Stream gas pipelines blast mysteryInside the giant district courthouse in Warsaw, Judge Lubowski announced his decision to the suspect, his family and legal team – and a large cluster of TV cameras.In a long and passionate speech, he said he was considering only the request to send Mr Zhuravlyov to Germany, not the substance of the case itself. But he was clear that the context of the war in Ukraine was critical.The judge described Russia's invasion as \"a bloody and genocidal attack\" and argued, quoting Aristotle and Saint Thomas Aquinas, that Ukraine had the legal right to defend itself.\"If Ukraine and its special forces… organised an armed mission to destroy enemy pipelines – which the court does not prejudge – then these actions were not unlawful. \"On the contrary, they were justified, rational and just,\" he told the court.BBC/Sarah RainsfordMr Zhuravlyov's wife, Yulianna, said it was important to hear the judge understood UkrainiansHe said the attack had \"deprived the enemy of billions of euros paid by Germany for the gas… and weakened Russia's military potential\".What could be seen as terrorism or sabotage in peace time, the judge said, was different in a time of war.Germany had in fact halted use of the two Nord Stream 1 pipelines after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Nord Stream 2 had not yet entered service.Poland has always been a vocal critic of that project for making Berlin too dependent on Moscow. The route deprived Poland of transit fees for the gas. Ukraine and the US were also longstanding opponents of the pipelines.Judge Lubowski insisted, though, that his ruling was a legal one, and not emotional or political. He also questioned whether Germany had jurisdiction even to bring its case, as the explosions were in international waters on pipelines with majority Russian state ownership.Announcing that Mr Zhuravlyov would be released from custody, he said the Ukrainian would also get compensation from the Polish state.\"I am happy… it was a really very hard three weeks,\" Mr Zhuravlyov's wife, Yulianna, told the BBC in court after the judge's verdict.\"For me, as a Ukrainian, it was very important to hear that he understands us.\"She said the family planned to stay in Poland, where they have lived since February 2022.Earlier, she described her husband's arrest at their home just outside Warsaw and said he denied any involvement in the sabotage.Volodymyr Zhuravlyov is a deep-sea diver, his wife has confirmed, but she called it a hobby and said he had no military role. He has a business in Poland installing air conditioners. Mrs Zhuravlyova could not tell the BBC exactly where her husband was when three of the four Nord Stream pipelines were blown up, because she said no-one had asked her to check.He is not the only suspect on Germany's list: another Ukrainian man was detained in Italy in August when he was on holiday. Serhiy Kuznetsov was also accused of \"unconstitutional sabotage\" and has denied any connection to the blasts. He is currently in a high security prison in northern Italy.A court in Bologna did rule he should be extradited to Berlin but earlier this week that verdict was annulled by the top appeals court in Rome and the case has been returned to Bologna to begin all over again.Asked about the decision, Germany's foreign minister said he respected the ruling and it was not the job of government to interfere with the courts.",

    "body": "8 hours agoAna FaguyGetty ImagesAfter serving 43 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, Subramanyam \"Subu\" Vedam was finally free. New evidence had exonerated him earlier this month of the murder of his former roommate.But before he could reach his family's arms, Mr Vedam was taken into custody by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), who want to deport him to India - a country he has not lived in since he was a baby.Now, Mr Vedam's legal team is fighting a deportation order and his family is determined to get him out of custody, for good.His family are now working to navigate a new and \"very different\" situation, his sister Saraswathi Vedam told the BBC. Her brother has gone from a facility where he knew inmates and guards alike, where he mentored fellow inmates, and where he had his own cell, to a facility where he shares a room with 60 men and where his history of good behaviour and mentorship is unknown.Mr Vedam has been repeating one message to his sister and other family members in the wake of the new situation: \"I want us to focus on the win.\"\"My name has been cleared, I'm no longer a prisoner, I'm a detainee.\"The 1980 murderMore than 40 years ago, Mr Vedam was convicted of murdering his once-roommate Tom Kinser, a 19-year-old college student. Kinser's body was found nine months after he went missing in a wooded area with a bullet wound in his skull. On the day of Kinser's disappearance, Mr Vedam had asked him for a ride. While the vehicle Kinser drove was returned to its usual spot, no one saw it being returned. Mr Vedam was charged with Kinser's murder. He was denied bail, had his passport and green card seized by authorities and was labelled a \"foreigner likely to flee\".Two years later he was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1984, he was sentenced to a separate two-and-a-half to five years for a drug offence, as part of a plea agreement. That sentence was to be served simultaneously with his life sentence. Throughout that time, Mr Vedam maintained his innocence on the murder charges. His supporters and family members stressed there was no physical evidence tying him to the crime. Getty ImagesMr Vedam's exoneration Mr Vedam repeatedly appealed the murder conviction and a few years ago new evidence in the case surfaced which exonerated. Earlier this month, Centre County District Attorney Bernie Cantorna said he would not pursue a new trial against Mr Vedam.But Mr Vedam's family knew there was one hurdle left before he was free: he still had a 1988 deportation order, based on his convictions for murder and a drug offence. The family expected they would have to file a motion to have his immigration case reopened, Ms Vedam said. The facts of the case are different now, she stressed.But when they arrested him, ICE cited the immigration order as their reasoning for quickly detaining him in a different Pennsylvania facility. While he was exonerated for the murder charge, his drug conviction still stands, they have said. The immigration agency said it acted on a lawfully issued order.ICE did not respond to the BBC's request for comment, but told other US outlets that Mr Vedam will remain in custody pending his deportation. Mr Vedam's family has said his decades of good behaviour, completion of three degrees and community service while behind bars should be considered when the immigration court examines his case.\"What was deeply disappointing was that we didn't even have a moment to hold him in our arms,\" Ms Vedam said. \"He was held wrongly and one would think that he conducted himself with such honour and purpose and integrity that that should mean something.\"Potential deportation to IndiaThe family has stressed Mr Vedam's ties to India - where ICE has said they would like to deport him to - are weak at best. While he was born there, he moved to the US at nine months old. What relatives are still alive, are distant ones, Ms Vedam told the BBC.His community - Ms Vedam, her four daughters and other cousins - are in the US and Canada. \"He will again be robbed and miss out on the lives of the people closet to him, by being half way across the world,\" she said. \"It's almost like having his life stolen twice.\"Mr Vedam, who is a legal permanent resident, had his citizenship application accepted before he was arrested. Both of his parents were also both US citizens.\"We believe deportation from the United States now, to send him to a country where he has few connections, would represent another terrible wrong done to a man who has already endured a record-setting injustice,\" his lawyer, Ava Benach said in a statement to the BBC.",

    "body": "2 days agoJohn Sudworthin Kyiv andSarah SmithNorth America editorNews of the phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday, in which they agreed to meet in person to discuss the war in Ukraine, will have come as an unwelcome surprise to Kyiv.The country is being hit hard. The last 24 hours alone have seen Russia launch dozens of missiles and more than 300 drones at multiple targets.Once again, they include a large amount of civilian infrastructure with further damage to the country's gas supply network, just as the first signs of cold herald a long, hard winter ahead.Attacks on the electrical grid are already leading to nationwide power outages.For Ukraine's government it's a sign of Russian desperation.The frontlines are at effective stalemate, involving huge loss of life for incremental territorial gains.Watch: Trump says he will have 'separate but equal' meetings with Putin and ZelenskyAnd the Russian economy is feeling the effects of the Ukrainian military's increasingly effective drone strikes on oil depots.So, President Volodymyr Zelensky's big hope was for more American military assistance to keep up that pressure.Before he boarded his plane to Washington, he seemed to believe that things were going his way.There was optimistic talk about Trump beginning to see the world through Ukraine's eyes, a big shift from that angry, humiliating Oval Office exchange in February when he accused Zelensky of \"gambling with World War Three\".The failure of the Trump-Putin Alaska summit in August and the intensifying bombardment of Ukraine were – it was thought – all causing the US president to lose patience with his \"good friend\", as he has called Putin.There were high hopes that Friday's meeting would finally yield the prize Ukraine has been seeking - Trump's permission for the purchase of long-range Tomahawk missiles.Trump's frustration with Putin was obvious on Sunday when he told reporters: \"Do they [Russia] want Tomahawks going in their direction? I don't think so.\"But how much of a game changer the missiles would really be is in much dispute among military experts and, with the complicated logistics, it could be months before they were deployed.But at the very least they would add to Ukraine's ability to strike deep into the heart of Russia and with a much more powerful weapon than any it currently possesses.They would also send a potent physical message to Putin about America's shifting allegiances.So, the two-and-a-half-hour Trump-Putin phone call, that took place while Zelensky was in flight, somewhat steals a march on the Ukrainian president's big moment.So far, though, he's putting something of a brave face on it, suggesting in a post sent on his arrival in Washington that Russia was panicking.The Kremlin was \"rushing to renew dialogue\", he said, precisely because of all the talk of the Tomahawks.Other analysts will see less panic and more of a classic Putin play at work in the phone call, which was said by the Kremlin to have taken place at Russia's behest.The issue of the Tomahawks was indeed discussed, with Putin reinforcing his view that their deployment would be seen as a significant act of provocation.The two men apparently discussed the \"colossal prospects\" – in Russia's words – for trade if peace were achieved.And then they agreed to their summit in Hungary. That will probably happen within the next two weeks, Trump said.Trump says he will meet Putin in Hungary after 'very productive' callAs Ukraine faces its fourth winter of war, few people here had much belief in Trump's claim that he could turn his \"success\" in the Middle East into momentum towards peace in Ukraine.One woman the BBC spoke to, badly injured in a Russian strike on a civilian railway carriage, shrugged her shoulders when we asked her if she saw an easy way out.\"A person like Putin can't be trusted,\" she said from her hospital bed.After touching down in Washington on Thursday evening, Zelensky met representatives of defence companies who produce the powerful weapons he says he needs to strengthen Ukraine's protection. He will still ask the White House for the Tomahawks.But Trump's willingness to give them was always in doubt and must, surely, be now further called into question.Meanwhile, Russia is being given something.A familiar pattern is developing. Every time Trump grows increasingly frustrated with Putin's intransigence over Ukraine he is then placated by a conversation with the Russian president.Each time they speak he seems to be persuaded of Putin's point of view and backs off his threats to apply tougher sanctions or supply more destructive weapons.The Hungary summit, offered without concessions, doesn't look like much of a loss of American patience.Never mind the Tomahawks. For now, Ukraine has been given a long-range curveball instead.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "21 hours agoBernd Debusmannat the White House andJohn SudworthKyivPresident Volodymyr Zelensky appears to have come away empty-handed from a White House meeting after US President Donald Trump indicated he was not ready to supply sought-after Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine.Zelensky said after the cordial bilateral talks that he and Trump had talked about long-range missiles, but decided not to make statements on the issue \"because the United States does not want an escalation\".Following the meeting, Trump took to social media to call for Kyiv and Moscow to \"stop where they are\" and end the war.The Trump-Zelensky meeting came a day after Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone and agreed to meet him in Hungary soon.Zelensky believes using Tomahawks to strike at Russian oil and energy facilities would severely weaken Putin's war economy. While Trump did not rule it out, his tone at the White House on Friday was non-committal. \"Hopefully they won't need it, hopefully we'll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks,\" the US president said, adding: \"I think we're fairly close to that.\"He described the weapons as \"a big deal\" and said that the US needed them for its own defence. He also said that supplying Tomahawks to Ukraine could mean a further escalation in the conflict, but that discussions about sending them would continue. Asked by the BBC if the Tomahawks had prompted Putin to meet Trump, the US president said: \"The threat of that [the missiles] is good, but the threat of that is always there.\"The Ukrainian leader suggested his country could offer drones in exchange for the Tomahawks, prompting smiles and nodding from Trump.Zelensky also complimented Trump on his role in securing the first phase of a peace deal in the Middle East, suggesting the US leader could build on that momentum to help end Russia's war in Ukraine. After the meeting, Zelensky was asked by a reporter outside the White House if he thought Putin wanted a deal or was just buying time with the planned meeting with Trump in Budapest. \"I don't know,\" he said, adding that the prospect of Ukraine having Tomahawks had caused Russia to be \"afraid because it is a strong weapon\".Asked if he was leaving Washington more optimistic that Ukraine would get the Tomahawks, he said: \"I am realistic.\"The Ukrainian leader also appeared to suggest he would be amenable to Trump's suggestion of stopping the war along the current front line.\"We have to stop where we are, he is right, the president is right,\" Zelensky said. He added that the step after that would be \"to speak\". He later posted on X, saying that he had called European leaders to share details of the meeting with Trump, adding that the \"main priority now is to protect as many lives as possible, guarantee security for Ukraine, and strengthen all of us in Europe.\"UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the call with European leaders was \"productive\" and promised that \"the UK will continue to send humanitarian aid and military support\".While Trump had shown an openness to the idea of selling the Tomahawks in recent days, Putin warned that such a move would further strain the US-Russian relationship.On Thursday, Trump said \"great progress\" was made during a phone call with Putin, with the pair agreeing to face-to-face talks soon in Hungary - although no date has been set.Asked by a reporter on Friday if he was concerned Putin might be playing for time by agreeing to a new summit, Trump said: \"I am.\"\"But I've been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well. So, it's possible, a little time, it's alright. But I think that I'm pretty good at this stuff. I think that he wants to make a deal,\" he said.When asked by another reporter whether Zelensky would be involved in the prospective talks in Budapest, Trump - who was sat beside the Ukrainian president  said there was \"bad blood\" between Putin and Zelenksy. \"We want to make it comfortable for everybody,\" Trump said. \"We'll be involved in threes, but it may be separated.\" He added that the three leaders \"have to get together\". The US president said his call, the first with Putin since mid-August, was \"very productive\", adding that teams from Washington and Moscow would meet next week.Trump had hoped a face-to-face summit in Alaska in August would help convince Putin to enter into comprehensive peace talks to end the war, but that meeting failed to produce a decisive breakthrough.They spoke again days later when Trump interrupted a meeting with Zelensky and European leaders to call Putin.Back in Ukraine, the BBC spoke on Friday to a couple repairing the small store they own in a suburb of Kyiv, after it was obliterated by Russian missiles last month.When the store-owner, Volodymyr, was asked about Trump's forthcoming summit meeting with Putin, he began to say: \"We appreciate all support\".But he stepped away as tears welled up in his eyes. After a long pause, he composed himself and started again.\"Truth and democracy will win, and all the terrorism and evil will disappear,\" he said. \"We just want to live, we don't want to give up, we just want them to leave us alone.\"",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has commuted the sentence of George Santos, a former Republican congressman serving seven years in prison for fraud and identity theft. In a post on social media, Trump said Santos \"has been horribly mistreated\", adding: \"Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life!\"The former lawmaker was only the sixth in US history to be expelled from Congress, after a damning ethics report in 2023. Santos, who admitted to stealing the identities of 11 people, including his own family members, was released on Friday night, US media reported. He served less than three months of a seven-year sentence.\"God bless President Donald J Trump,\" said one of Santos's lawyers, Joseph Murray, following Trump's announcement.In April when Santos was sentenced a judge told him: \"You got elected with your words, most of which were lies.\"He reportedly cried in court and begged for forgiveness, saying: \"I cannot rewrite the past, but I can control the road ahead.\"Prosecutors argued that the novice politician had lied about his background and misused campaign funds to finance his lifestyle.In his post, Trump justified the move by criticising a Democratic lawmaker, Senator Richard Blumenthal, whom he accused of fabricating his US military service. \"This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\" Trump wrote.Trump has previously called for an investigation into Blumenthal over the claim. The Democrat has acknowledged that he misspoke on numerous occasions about his time in the military, but has said the mishaps were more than a decade old. \"This allegation of 15 years ago has been really rejected by the voters of Connecticut three times, overwhelmingly re-electing me,\" Blumenthal told CNN earlier this month. Santos's downfall began in 2022, after the New York Times published an investigation revealing the freshman congressman had lied about his CV, including having a university degree and working for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.From there, the lies continued to pile up, including allegations that he stole money from a fundraiser for a dying dog and that he lied about his mother surviving the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Shortly afterwards, local and federal officials began to investigate.He was eventually charged with 23 federal felony crimes, and in 2023 became the first expelled member of Congress in more than 20 years, and only the sixth in history.A report from the House ethics panel accused him of misusing campaign funds for personal benefits, including Botox and subscriptions on the OnlyFans website.Santos defeated a Democratic incumbent in 2022, flipping the district that encompasses parts of New York's Long Island and Queens, where he grew up.Earlier this week, Santos published an open letter to Trump in the South Shore Press newspaper in Long Island, repeating his plea to be pardoned. The letter, which was titled a \"passionate plea to President Trump\" asked for \"the opportunity to return to my family, my friends, and my community.\"He wrote that he had been kept in solitary confinement after a death threat in August, and apologised for his actions. \"Mr President, I am not asking for sympathy. I am asking for fairness - for the chance to rebuild,\" he wrote.\"I know I have made mistakes in my past. I have faced my share of consequences, and I take full responsibility for my actions. \"But no man, no matter his flaws, deserves to be lost in the system, forgotten and unseen, enduring punishment far beyond what justice requires.\"Santos began serving his sentence in July at a minimum-security jail in New Jersey.Trump has issued pardons to at least two other former Republican lawmakers since returning to office in January.In May, he pardoned former congressman Michael Grimm, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to tax crimes.He also pardoned former Connecticut Governor John Rowland, who pleaded guilty in 2004 to corruption and fraud charges.Commutations do not void criminal convictions, unlike a pardon.",

    "body": "14 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent  , JerusalemGaza's Hamas-run civil defence says 11 people were killed, all from the same family, after the bus they were in was hit by an Israeli tank shell in northern Gaza.The Abu Shaaban family, it said, were trying to reach their home to inspect it when the incident happened in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City on Friday night.This is the deadliest single incident involving Israeli soldiers in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire eight days ago.The Israeli military said soldiers had fired at a \"suspicious vehicle\" that had crossed the so-called yellow line demarcating the area still occupied by Israeli forces in Gaza.Israeli soldiers continue to operate in more than half of the Gaza Strip, under the terms of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement.Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP news agency the victims were killed while \"trying to check on their home\" in the area.The dead included women and children, according to the civil defence.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said a \"suspicious vehicle was identified crossing the yellow line and approaching IDF troops operating in the northern Gaza Strip\" on Friday, prompting it to fire \"warning shots\" towards the vehicle.It said the vehicle \"continued to approach the troops in a way that caused an imminent threat to them\" and \"troops opened fire to remove the threat, in accordance with the agreement.\"Hamas said the family had been targeted without justification.The IDF has warned Palestinians from entering areas in Gaza still under its control. With limited internet access, many Palestinians do not know the position of Israeli troops as the yellow demarcation line is not physically marked, and it is unclear if the area where the bus was travelling did cross it.The BBC has asked the IDF for coordinates of the incident.Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said on Friday the army would set up visual signs to indicate the location of the line.In a separate development, Hamas on Friday released the body of Israeli hostage Eliyahu Margalit to the Red Cross, which returned it to Israel.Mr Margalit was the tenth deceased hostage to be returned from Gaza. The remains of another 18 people are yet to be repatriated. Israel handed the bodies of 15 more Palestinians over to officials in Gaza via the Red Cross, the Hamas-run health ministry said, bringing the total number of bodies it has received to 135.There has been anger in Israel that Hamas has not returned all of the dead hostages' bodies, in line with last week's ceasefire deal - though the US has downplayed the suggestion it amounts to a breach.The IDF has stressed that Hamas must \"uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages\".Hamas has blamed Israel for making the task difficult because Israeli strikes have reduced so many buildings to rubble and it does not allow heavy machinery and diggers into Gaza to be able to search for the hostages' bodies.As part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Hamas also returned all 20 living hostages to Israel. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 67,900 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.",

    "body": "4 hours agoJulie Yoonnyung LeeBloomsbury PublishingFor South Koreans, tteokbokki is more than a snack. It's soul food. This sweet and spicy dish made with chewy rice cakes is a staple of Korea's street food culture and beloved by people of all ages.It's the food students turn to after long school days, and as adults, one you seek after a hard day at work.So when readers came across a book titled I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki in 2018, many were immediately intrigued. Its honest yet playful title sparked curiosity, some wondering just how much you must love tteokbokki to write an entire book about it. Many were soon drawn to its raw honesty.It became an instant bestseller that was widely discussed and resonated deeply in Korea. This week, Baek Se-hee, the book's South Korean author, died aged 35. The details surrounding her death remain unclear. The fact the Korean Organ Donation Agency said Baek had saved five lives by donating her organs, emphasised her wish to help others.Her death at such a young age has brought deep sorrow to readers who found comfort and understanding in her words. Social media and blogs have been flooded with tributes and personal stories from those her books have helped, while news outlets around the world reported her passing prominently.At its heart, the book is a record of Baek's conversations with her psychiatrist as she navigates dysthymia - a mild but long-lasting type of depression - and anxiety disorders. Through these sessions, she opens up about her daily struggles - such as overthinking others' opinions, obsessing over her appearance, and wrestling with self-doubt. Rather than examining clinical depression, she reflects on the gentle melancholy many can relate to.What makes her story so compelling is its candour. She captures that delicate human contradiction of living wearily with everyday sadness alongside the simultaneous desire to keep going. Just like a comforting dish of tteokbokki on a difficult day, her words offer warmth and understanding, reminding readers that even in vulnerability there is strength.A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line. If you are outside of the UK, you can visit the Befrienders website.Instagram / Baek Se-heeBaek Se-hee's memoir was lauded for its honest portrayal of mental health conversations'It's okay not to be perfect'One of the many young people the book resonated with is Jo Eun Bit, a 25-year-old student at Korea University in Seoul, who found it helped her navigate uncertainty about her future.\"All generations in Korea tend to measure themselves against what others are doing and the achievements they've made, and that only fuels competition,\" she said. \"But I liked this book because it seems to send the message that it's okay not to live according to the standards set by society.\"One of the most memorable passages in her book is that I am a one-of-a-kind being in this world, and that alone makes me special. I am someone I should care for throughout my life. The more I look within myself, the happier I believe I will become.  Passages of the book resonated with Jo Eun Bit\"To me, this offered comfort that it's okay not to be perfect, and at the same time reminded me that I, too, am someone who needs to be nurtured and cared for.\"The relentless competition from school to the workplace, coupled with the pressure to meet family and societal expectations, is leaving many young South Koreans feeling disheartened. In a society still influenced by Confucian values such as righteousness and obedience, mental health issues remain heavily stigmatised and many experience feelings of shame or social judgement.Baek's book inverted the notion that social success is the ultimate measure of a life well lived, openly addressing the mental health issues many commonly face and, in doing so, showing readers that acknowledging your emotions is the first step towards healing.Sangeun Lee, an elementary school teacher in Korea, told the BBC the book has held a particularly special meaning to her for that reason. \"With the rise of social media, we're exposed to other people's lives too much, and it makes us increasingly critical of ourselves,\" the 35-year-old said.\"Being imperfect is natural for everyone, but seeing so much of this kind of information can feel like an attack on yourself, making you wonder if it's even okay to live the way you do. This book encouraged me to accept myself as I am.\"Something many people relate toThe book's popularity has had a real-world impact, supporting many struggling with depression to seek professional help. It has also brought mental health issues into public conversation - RM of BTS, the globally renowned K-pop group known for songs promoting self-love, is among those who have shared the book online.Baek's pages have resonated far beyond South Korea. First published in 2018, it has sold more than a million copies worldwide and been translated into 25 languages. In the UK, it sold 100,000 copies within six months of its release.It has struck a chord with young women and played a significant role in expanding the reach of Korean literature. Marianna Szucs, a secondary school teacher in London, told the BBC she felt a connection to it and deep sorrow at Baek's death.\"Her book tells you that if you feel depressed or feel like you have problems, you are not the only one. She had all sorts of problems, from tiny little things to quite daunting ones. I think anyone who reads this book can find something they can relate to.\"Seunghye Sun, director of the Korean Cultural Centre UK, said \"it is highly symbolic that Baek Se-hee's voice has found resonance in the UK where great psychoanalysts like Freud and his daughter explored the human mind\", in the process broadening the spectrum of K-literature and K-culture.Her book tells a story that transcends generations and borders, sending a quiet but warm message to countless nameless readers around the world.In the end, the paradoxical title \"I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki\" may, in fact, be another way of saying, \"I want to live.\" Even in moments of deep despair, people often find the strength to carry on through small joys.For her, that joy was tteokbokki, and it shows even the simplest pleasures in daily life can become a sustaining force.More weekend picks",

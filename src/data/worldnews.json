    "body": "6 hours agoGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianandAlys DaviesGrowing unrest in Iran is reported to have claimed more lives on a fifth day of protests over the soaring cost of living.Both the semi-official Fars news agency and human rights group, Hengaw, said two people had died during clashes between protesters and security forces in the city of Lordegan, in south-western Iran. Three more people were killed in Azna and another in Kouhdasht, Fars reported, all in the west of the country.On Thursday videos posted on social media showed cars set on fire during running battles between protesters and security forces. Many protesters have called for ending the rule of the country's supreme leader. Some have also called for a return to the monarchy.As the day wore on more reports came in of unrest up and down the country, on the fifth day of the protests, sparked by a currency collapse.Videos verified by BBC Persian show protests in the central city of Lordegan, the capital Tehran and Marvdasht in the southern Fars province taking place on Thursday.Fars reported that in Lordegan two people were killed, citing an informed official. The report did not specify whether those killed were protesters or members of the security forces. It also reported the three deaths in Azna, in neighbouring Lorestan province, without specifying if there were protesters or security officials. Rights group Hengaw said the two killed in Lordegan were protesters, naming them as Ahmad Jalil and Sajjad Valamanesh.BBC Persian has not been able to independently verify the deaths.Separately state media said a member of the security forces linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) was killed in clashes with protesters on Wednesday night in the city of Kouhdasht, in the western Lorestan province. The BBC has not been able to verify this and protesters say the man was one of their number and was shot dead by the security forces. A further 13 police officers and Basij members were injured by stone throwing in the area, the state media report said.Schools, universities and public institutions were closed across the country on Wednesday after a bank holiday was declared by authorities in an apparent effort to quell the unrest. It was ostensibly to save energy because of the cold weather, though it was seen by many Iranians as an attempt to contain the protests.They began in Tehran - among shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and they had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who was accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly. But they have not been on the same scale.To prevent any escalation, tight security is now reported in the areas of Tehran where the demonstrations began.President Masoud Pezeshkian has said his government will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.But the prosecutor general, Mohammad Movahedi-Azad, has also warned that any attempt to create instability would be met with what he called a \"decisive response\".",

    "body": "2 days agoRozina SiniandTom BennettReutersA train driver was killed and at least 40 others were injured in the crash on TuesdayA passenger has described \"chaos\" after two trains collided head-on near Peru's most popular tourist attraction, Machu Picchu.Niels Honkoop, 33, told the BBC he had switched seats part-way through the journey from the middle of the train to the back, before it crashed, injuring many of those sitting near the front.\"I saw staff running around and people crying and people on the floor and chaos erupted,\" he said. \"We got off the train and I saw people bleeding with very severe injuries.\"A train driver was killed and at least 40 others were injured in the crash, which took place at around 13:20 local time (18:20 GMT) on Tuesday. Mr Honkoop said the table in front of him broke in two. Shattered glass littered the floor of the carriage, and many were lying wounded in the aisle. One woman he saw was trapped \"between a bench and a table\". He tried to assist by moving luggage and handing out painkillers, as, by coincidence, \"I'd had a wisdom tooth removed recently so I had lots of painkillers on me\".AFP via Getty ImagesThe UK Foreign Office said it was \"supporting a number of British nationals involved\" in the crash, while the US embassy in Peru said that US citizens were injured. After the crash, Mr Honkoop said another train arrived with medical assistance. He and his tour group were taken to a nearby village where they were given food and medical care and taken to a hotel. The collision occurred on the track linking Ollantaytambo Station and Aguas Calientes, the closest town to Machu Picchu. The journey between the two stations usually takes around 90 minutes.The two trains involved were operated by PeruRail and Inca Rail respectively.Niels HonkoopNiels Honkoop (right) described the accident as \"chaos\"\"We deeply regret what has happened,\" PeruRail said in a statement, adding that its staff had \"immediately\" provided first aid to the train driver, the train conductor and the passengers involved in the incident.The cause of the accident has not yet been made clear.It comes amid an ongoing dispute between providers of transport to the Unesco world heritage site, with local communities unhappy with what they say is an insufficiently open bidding process.The trains and buses that take tourists to the ancient town have steep ticket prices and can be highly lucrative for operators due to its limited accessibility.Built in the Peruvian Andes in the 15th Century, the Incan city of Machu Picchu is one of the Seven Modern Wonders of the World.Visitors can take a series of trains and buses to reach the site, or hike along the Inca trail with a registered tour operator.In 2011, officials implemented a daily cap on visitors to protect and preserve the site, but concerns remain about over-tourism.Watch: Injured passengers helped from train after collision near Machu PicchuMore on this story",

    "body": "Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is among some 60 female lawmakers petitioning for more women's toilets in the parliament building to match their growing representation in the legislature.A record 73 women were elected into the 465-seat Lower House in October 2024, exceeding the previous high of 54 in 2009.One opposition lawmaker, Yasuko Komiyama, said there were often \"long queues in front of the restroom... before plenary sessions start\", and quoted another MP who said she had \"given up\" going to the toilet before a session began. There is one female toilet with two cubicles near the plenary chamber, though the entire building itself has nine female toilets with 22 cubicles.There are a total of 12 men's toilets with 67 stalls and urinals across the building, according to local media reports. The current situation is \"often inconvenient\" because female staff and visitors also share the toilets, said Ms Komiyama from the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party.\"I want to raise my voice and prepare myself for the day when women hold more than 30% of [parliamentary seats] in the future,\" she wrote in a post on Facebook.Japan's parliament building was built in 1936, a decade before women were given the right to vote in 1945. The first women were appointed to parliament in 1946.The parliament building is a sprawling three-storey structure, with a central portion that is nine storeys high. The building occupies 13,356 square metres (143,800 sq ft), the equivalent of about two football pitches, with a total floor area of 53,464 square metres.\"If the administration is serious about promoting women's empowerment, I believe we can count on their understanding and cooperation,\" Komiyama said, according to Japanese media.Chair of the Lower House committee Yasukazu Hamada has \"expressed a willingness\" to consider the proposal for more women's toilets, said an Asahi Shimbun report. The Japanese government earlier set a target of having 30% of leadership roles across all sectors of society held by women by 2020, but at the end of that year the timeframe was quietly pushed back by a decade.Women currently hold nearly 16% of the seats in the Lower House and about a third – or 42 out of 125 seats – in the Upper House.Takaichi, who became Japan's first female leader in October last year, had pledged to raise female representation in her cabinet to levels comparable to Nordic countries, which hold the top spots in terms of female leadership.But she has appointed just two other women to her 19-member cabinet.In Japan, the dearth of women's restrooms extends beyond the legislative chamber.Long lines in front of women's public restrooms are a common sight nationwide. Former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba had said his government would look into \"enhancing women's restroom facilities\" to make Japan a society where \"women can live their lives with peace of mind\".",

    "body": "Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro said on Thursday he was open to talks with the US on drug trafficking and oil, after weeks of an escalating pressure campaign against his government.In an interview with Venezuelan state TV, Maduro said he was ready for dialogue with the US \"wherever they want and whenever they want\". He also evaded a question about a statement by President Donald Trump that the US had hit a docking facility in Venezuela - the first such attack inside the country reportedly carried out by the CIA. US forces have been hitting vessels they suspect of smuggling narcotics through the Caribbean and eastern Pacific for the past three months.In total, there have been more than 30 strikes on vessels as part of the Trump administration's \"war on drugs\" , with more than 110 people killed since the US carried out its first attack on a boat in international waters on 2 September.The latest attack came on Wednesday when two boats alleged to be carrying drugs were struck, killing five people on board, according to the US military.On Monday, Trump said the US had carried out a strike on a \"dock area\" linked to alleged Venezuelan drug boats, causing a \"major explosion\".The blast was caused by a drone strike carried out by the CIA, according to CNN and the New York Times, which cited sources close to the matter. If confirmed, it would be the first known US operation inside Venezuela.But Maduro was elusive in the interview. Asked if he could confirm or deny the attack, Maduro said \"this could be something we talk about in a few days\". As well as drug trafficking, Maduro also said he was open for talks on oil and migration.In recent months, Trump has focused on fighting the influx of drugs - especially fentanyl and cocaine - into the US.The US president has also doubled the reward for information leading to Maduro's capture and has announced that he would designate the Maduro government as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO).Maduro has vehemently denied being a cartel leader and has accused the US of using its \"war on drugs\" as an excuse to try to depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's vast oil reserves.Counternarcotic experts say that Venezuela is a relatively minor player in global drug trafficking, acting as a transit country through which drugs produced elsewhere are smuggled.Its neighbour, Colombia, is the world's largest producer of cocaine but most of it is thought to enter the US by other routes, not via Venezuela.Without providing evidence, Trump has accused Maduro of \"emptying his prisons and insane asylums\" and \"forcing\" its inmates to migrate to the US.Close to eight million Venezuelans are estimated to have fled the country's economic crisis and repression since 2013 - some heading for the US.The US has also been cracking down on sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela.US forces seized an oil tanker off Venezuela on 10 December, saying it was \"used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran\". Venezuela described it as an act of \"international piracy\". Since then, the US has seized one more oil tanker and pursued a third. The Trump administration has cast its operations against alleged drug boats as a non-international armed conflict against the alleged traffickers, but legal experts say they could be in violation of the laws governing such conflict.The US has provided no evidence that the boats it has targeted are carrying drugs. But the US Southern Command again insisted this week that \"intelligence confirmed the vessels were transiting along known narco-trafficking routes and engaged in narco-trafficking\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoMayeni JonesAfrica correspondent, JohannesburgChristian Parkinson / BBCArnold Ncube was unable to complete his education because he could not prove he was South AfricanMany people may take their birth certificate, or similar official papers, for granted - hidden in a drawer and rarely seeing the light of day - but for those without one, it can lead to a shadow life or an uncertain existence.This is thought to affect millions of people around the world, described as stateless, and 25-year-old South African Arnold Ncube is one of those.Because he has no state-issued documents, washing cars in the backstreets of Thembisa township near Johannesburg is one of the few ways he can make a living.He was born in Johannesburg and his father is South African, qualifying him for citizenship here. But when he tried to register for secondary school, he realised he didn't have a birth certificate.Having been abandoned by his parents - his dad left before he was born and his mum when he was 14 - he could not prove his status.\"It's a painful thing,\" he says. \"You're basically invisible. You don't exist. It's like you're living in the shadows. You don't have a bank account, you can't apply for a decent job that you can earn a living with.\"He adds that he tries to stay positive but it's been challenging.\"When I see my peers, they are done with school now. Whereas I couldn't study further. It's a lot. Depression was once my friend.\"Arnold is one of at least an estimated 10,000 stateless people living in South Africa who, despite being born here, are struggling to prove their nationality and access public services.There are no official statistics available on stateless people here because they tend to slip through the cracks. So the figures are based on estimations by organisations like the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR and civil rights organisations.With no citizenship, stateless people cannot get documents and struggle to get access to basic necessities including education and healthcare.Statelessness is caused by many factors, including administrative barriers and poor record-keeping. As a result the real number of stateless people is hard to gauge in many parts of the world.Ed Habershon / BBCChristy Chitengu only found out at 17 that she was statelessHuman rights lawyer and advocate Christy Chitengu used to be stateless herself.She only got South African citizenship three years ago with the help of the organisation Lawyers for Human Rights who worked on her case for free.\"I found out I was stateless at the age of 17. My high school principal called me into her office and told me that she didn't have any documents for me and that she didn't understand how I'd gotten into the school,\" she tells the BBC near her home in northern Johannesburg.\"I was born in Johannesburg to two foreign parents [both from Zimbabwe] and at my birth I was given a handwritten South African birth certificate.\"But officials in South Africa need a printed certificate.Christy says that when she found out she was stateless she looked into taking her parents' nationality but it was too late.\"I couldn't claim my Zimbabwean citizenship because by that time I was 16 and they wouldn't allow me to do a late birth registration. Also I would have had to physically leave South Africa to get a Zimbabwean passport and without any documents to leave the country, I wouldn't be allowed back in.\"South Africa has large numbers of undocumented migrants and the authorities and local vigilante groups have been trying to crack down on irregular migration for years.When asked whether giving stateless children citizenship could be seen as a reward to undocumented migrants who give birth in South Africa, Christy disagrees.\"I think citizenship is not a reward. It's an entitlement for someone to be able to live a dignified life and for someone to be seen as a human being. I think if we look at it through that lens, we realise that there's nothing that we lose by recognising a child who would otherwise not be able to go to primary school or receive healthcare.\"Getty ImagesIn South Africa, an estimated 10,000 people are stateless On several occasions, the BBC contacted the home affairs department, which handles immigration issues in South Africa, to find out how it is tackling the issue of statelessness but got no reply.Statelessness is not just an issue here, it is a huge global problem.There's an estimated 4.5 million stateless people around the world. Some say the figure could even be as high as 15 million.Experts believe tackling the problem requires policy changes, including allowing refugees to register their children where they're born, and giving mothers the right to pass their nationality to their children.\"For us statelessness is not just a legal issue, it's a matter that involves the right to development,\" says Jesus Perez Sanchez who works for the UNHCR.\"That person that's affected by statelessness will not be able to contribute fully to that country that is hosting. So we think that it's important that as a matter of inclusion, all issues of statelessness are addressed so that all these people on the margins of society can contribute fully to society and the economy.\"Back in Thembisa, Arnold is playing football with local children.After years of struggle, he now has a lawyer helping him fight for the papers that prove he belongs here. He wants to go back to school to study computer science. He hopes having documents will lead to a brighter future.Additional reporting by Christian ParkinsonMore from South Africa:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "5 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterChina's BYD is set to overtake Elon Musk's Tesla as the world's biggest seller of  electric vehicles (EVs), marking the first time it has outpaced its American rival for annual sales.On Thursday, BYD said that sales of its battery-powered cars rose last year by almost 28% to more than 2.25 million.Tesla, which is due to reveal its total sales for 2025 later on Friday, last week published analysts' estimates suggesting that it had sold around 1.65 million vehicles for the year as a whole.The US firm has faced a tough year with a mixed reception to new offerings, unease over Musk's political activities and intensifying competition from Chinese rivals.Chinese firms such as Geely, MG, and BYD - now the country's largest electric car company - have put pressure on Western rivals by pricing their vehicles below established brands.In October, Tesla responded by launching lower-priced versions of its two best selling models in the US in a bid to boost sales.Musk, who is already the world's richest man, is tasked with significantly boosting Tesla's sales and stock market value over the next decade to secure a record-breaking pay package. The deal, which was approved by shareholders in November, could see him getting a payout of as much as $1tn (£740bn).As part of the agreement, Musk also has to sell a million humanoid robots over the next ten years. Tesla has invested heavily in its \"Optimus\" product and self-driving \"Robotaxis\".Tesla sales slumped in the first three months of 2025 after a backlash against Musk's role in US President Donald Trump's administration.Besides Tesla, the multi-billionaire's business interests also include the social media platform X, the rocket firm SpaceX and the Boring Company, which digs tunnels.Those commitments, along with running Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), led some investors to suggest that Musk was not focusing enough on Tesla.Since then Musk has pledged to \"significantly\" cut back his role in the US government.Despite BYD's rise in recent years, its sales growth slowed in 2025 to the weakest rate in five years, in part due to fierce competition in China, its key market.Still, BYD remains a global EV powerhouse as its prices often undercut rival carmakers.The Shenzhen-based company's rapid expansion - especially in Latin America, South East Asia and parts of Europe - comes despite many countries imposing steep tariffs on Chinese EVs.In October, BYD said the UK had become its biggest market outside China. The firm said that its sales in Britain surged by 880% in the year to the end of September, driven by strong demand for the plug-in hybrid version of its Seal U sports utility vehicle (SUV).",

    "body": "1 hour agoMakuochi Okafor,BBC AfricaandWycliffe MuiaAt least seven people have died and many others are missing after a boat carrying about 200 migrants attempting to reach Europe capsized off the coast of The Gambia, authorities say. The boat overturned on Wednesday midnight near Jinack village in the North Bank Region and it was later found \"grounded on a sandbank\", the country's defence ministry said in a statement. Ninety-six people have been rescued so far and a search is continuing for other passengers who were aboard the shipwrecked vessel that was heading towards Spain's Canary Islands.The perilous journey over the Atlantic Ocean has become an increasingly common route for African migrants trying to reach Europe.Nearly 47,000 people reached the Canary Islands in 2024 and the Spanish non-government organisation Caminando Fronteras estimates more than 9,000 migrants have died trying.After Wednesday's accident, the Gambian Navy launched a search-and-rescue operation, involving several naval vessels and a fishing boat that came to assist, the defence ministry said. Authorities say several of the victims are not Gambian nationals and that their identities are still being verified.The bodies of the seven people who drowned have been recovered, and 10 of those rescued are said to be in critical condition and receiving urgent medical care.The Gambia is increasingly being used by West African migrants and asylum seekers as a launchpad for the crossing to Spain's Canary Islands, and then on to mainland Europe.In recent years, the European Union has reached agreements with several North African countries aimed at reducing irregular migration, but this has pushed many migrants to take the longer and more dangerous Atlantic Ocean route.",

    "body": "10 hours agoBen TobiasWatch: BBC reports from the scene of Swiss resort bar fireAround 40 people have died and 115 people are injured following a fire in a ski resort in south-west Switzerland, police say.Authorities said several nationalities were likely involved in the New Year's Day fire, which happened at 01:30 local time (00:30 GMT) in a bar called Le Constellation in the resort of Crans-Montana. It is being treated as a fire and there is \"no question\" of an attack, the region's chief prosecutor said.Switzerland's President Guy Parmelin has called it \"one of the worst tragedies that our country has experienced\". LATEST UPDATES: Read more about the Swiss ski resort fireA helpline has been set up for concerned families: +41 848 112 117Here's what we know so far. What do we know about the victims? At a news conference on Thursday afternoon police said around 40 people were killed in the fire and 115 people were injured, many severely. The injured have been transported to hospitals across Switzerland. A burns unit in Milan in neighbouring Italy has also been made available. The director of Lausanne University Hospital told a Swiss newspaper that 22 patients had been transferred to her centre's care so far, mostly aged 16-26. Work is ongoing to identify the victims and return bodies to families as quickly as possible, the region's chief-prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud said.But the Italian ambassador to Switzerland warned it could take weeks to identify the dead. Earlier, Italy's foreign minister said identification would be difficult due to the severe burns. People from several countries are believed to be involved. The Italian Foreign Ministry has told the BBC that 16 Italian nationals are currently missing, and between 12 and 15 others are receiving treatment in hospital.  Three Italian nationals - a woman in her twenties and two boys under 16 - were being taken to Milan to be treated at Niguarda hospital's major burns unit, local councillor Guido Bertolaso said.The French foreign ministry said eight of its citizens were missing and that it could not rule out that French nationals were among the dead.French media earlier reported that at least two of the injured are French nationals.French football club FC Metz said one of its youth players was \"severely burned\" in the fire. Tahirys Dos Santos, 19, has been airlifted to a hospital in Germany for treatment, the club said in a statement.President Emmanuel Macron said France was \"ready to provide any assistance\" and that people injured in the fire were welcome to be treated in French hospitals. The EU is also providing medical assistance to the victims, the bloc's President Ursula von der Leyen said.The UK embassy in Switzerland says it is monitoring the situation but it has not been approached for assistance. Consular staff are on standby to support any British nationals affected, a Foreign Office statement said.What caused the fire? The cause is currently unknown but authorities say initial evidence does not suggest an attack.Asked about earlier reports of an explosion, regional security official Stéphane Ganzer said it \"is not the detonation of an explosive device that causes the fire, it is the fire which, as it develops, causes an explosion and a general conflagration of the premises\".Two French nationals who said they were in the bar at the time described seeing a waitress put a birthday candle on top of a champagne bottle. \"One of the candles was held too close to the ceiling, which caught fire. In a matter of seconds, the entire ceiling was ablaze. Everything was made of wood.\" Emma and Albane told French media outlet BFMTV.They described the evacuation as \"very difficult\" because the escape route was \"narrow\" and the stairs to get outside \"even narrower\". 'I hid from a wall of heat': Eyewitnesses describe escapeDisbelief as tragedy hits ski resort on New Year's DayIn a news conference on Thursday, Ms Pilloud did not confirm if the staircases were  narrow, adding that investigations would assess whether they were in line with requirements.The regional police commander Frédéric Gisler said smoke was first seen emanating from a bar at around 01:30 local time, at which point emergency services were called. The first police officers were quickly on the scene followed by a major deployment of rescue teams, Mr Gisler said. Video shows moment Swiss bar fire appears to startWhat do we know about Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana? Le Constellation is a large bar in the the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana which has been around for many years. Although the resort itself is quite upmarket, Le Constellation was not particularly posh, the BBC's Silvia Costeloe reported from the resort.Upstairs, there is an area with TV screens where people go to watch football matches. Downstairs is a big bar where people were likely drinking and dancing. It could hold up to 300 people and had a small terrace, although it is unknown how many people were there at the time of the fire. The Christmas and New Year holidays are one of the busiest times of the year for Alpine ski resorts, and it is likely the bar was full of Swiss people and tourists celebrating the start of 2026. A promotional video posted on YouTube for Le Constellation bar,  published in May 2024, showed women in motorcycle helmets walking through the bar while carrying sparklers in alcohol bottles above their heads.The caption, written in French, read: \"The Constellation Crans-Montana welcomes you every day from 9am to 2am, 365 days a year without interruption.\"Police Cantonale ValaisannePolice have released images from inside the bar after the fire showing chairs and benches strewn across the room",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump says he is in \"perfect\" health, takes more aspirin than doctors recommend, uses makeup to cover bruising on his hands, and does not get regular exercise because he finds it \"boring\".In a lengthy interview about his health, Trump also told The Wall Street Journal that he underwent a CT scan in October, after incorrectly telling reporters that he had undergone a more detailed MRI scan.Trump, 79, is the oldest president inaugurated in US history, and signs of age have been showing. He has appeared to fall asleep in some meetings and not to be able to hear questions.The Journal said Trump \"expressed irritation about the public debate over his health\".\"Let's talk about health again for the 25th time,\" he said at the start of an \"impromptu phone call\" as the newspaper prepared to publish a story about Trump's health. Trump said he had been taking larger than recommended doses of aspirin for the last 25 years, even as he said it caused him to bruise easily.\"They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don't want thick blood pouring through my heart,\" Trump said. He takes 325mg of aspirin per day, rather than the 81mg dose sometimes recommended by doctors. \"They'd rather have me take the smaller one,\" Trump said. But he does not want to switch routines after so many years. \"I'm a little superstitious,\" he said. The president also talked about the medical scan he received at Walter Reed National Medical Center, which he previously said was an MRI scan.\"It wasn't an MRI,\" Trump told the Journal. \"It was less than that. It was a scan.\"A doctor for Trump, Navy Capt Sean Barbaella, said in a statement provided to the Journal that Trump had undergone a CT scan, \"to definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues\" and that the testing revealed no abnormalities.After Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition in older people, he was advised to wear compression socks but he declined. \"I didn't like them,\" Trump said, adding that he now gets up from his desk more regularly, which has improved swelling in his legs. Still, the president said he preferred not to do any form of regular exercise, other than golfing.\"I just don't like it. It's boring,\" Trump said. \"To walk on a treadmill or run on a treadmill for hours and hours like some people do, that's not for me.\"The president maintained that he had not nodded off during public meetings, saying he closed his eyes at times because he finds it \"relaxing\". As for the bruising seen on his hands in some photos, Trump said he now carried makeup in case his hand got \"whacked\".\"I have makeup that's, you know, easy to put on, takes about 10 seconds,\" he said.Trump said he did not have trouble with his hearing, and when photographers have taken photos of him when he appears to be sleeping, he said \"sometimes they'll take a picture of me blinking\".\"And they'll catch me with the blink.\"Barbabella said in the statement to the Journal that Trump was in \"exceptional health and perfectly suited to execute his duties as Commander in Chief\".",

    "body": "18 hours agoAna FaguyAdrienne MartinAdrienne Martin faced a difficult choice after her monthly healthcare premium increased dramaticallyAdrienne Martin and her family are starting the New Year off without healthcare. The 47-year-old Texas mother had to make a difficult choice when she found out her monthly healthcare premium was increasing in 2026 from what she described as a manageable $630 (£467) to an unaffordable $2,400 (£1,781). Her husband depends on an IV medication to treat a blood-clotting disease that costs $70,000 a month without insurance. Knowing their benefits would expire, the family stockpiled the drug to survive the first few months of the year. \"It would be like paying two mortgage payments,\" she said of the new monthly price for healthcare. \"We can't pay $30,000 for insurance a year.\"Ms Martin and her family are not the only ones facing this conundrum. Millions of Americans will see their healthcare bills skyrocket when these subsidies, which were provided through the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare,  expire.Some members of Congress on both sides of the aisle attempted to extend these subsidies into 2026, but Washington was gridlocked. A vote in the new year could offer hope, but until then, many like Ms Martin will have to live without insurance or see their bills steeply increase.About 24 million Americans buy health insurance through the ACA marketplace, and the majority were used to receiving tax credits to lower the monthly price.Those tax credits, also referred to as subsidies, were first introduced through former President Barack Obama's ACA in 2014. They were then expanded during Covid. The fight to extend the subsidies became the centre of the longest government shutdown in US history, which went on for more than 40 days earlier this year. Democrats wanted to force Republicans to extend the subsidies for an additional three years, which would cost $35bn per year. Republicans did not want the government to foot the bill for another three years of subsidies without spending cuts. The weeks-long shutdown - which left millions without essential government services - ended when a group of Democratic senators agreed to reopen the government, if Republicans in the Senate agreed to vote on extending the subsidies. But that vote still hasn't happened yet, despite efforts from Democrats and four Republicans to put the issue to Congress before the subsidies expired.\"I am pissed for the American people,\" New York Congressman Mike Lawler, a Republican who pushed to save the subsidies, said. \"Everybody has a responsibility to serve their district, to their constituents. You know what is funny? Three-quarters of people on Obamacare are in states Donald Trump won.\"Without the subsidies, the monthly cost of healthcare could rise by 114% on average, according to health research non-profit KFF.Adrienne Martin and Stephanie PetersenAdrienne Martin and Stephanie PetersenMaddie Bannister is among the Americans bracing for that. The California mother, who just had her second child, was paying $124 a month for her family of three in 2025. Now, with a new baby and no ACA subsidies, she is preparing to pay $908 a month. \"So many people are going to choose to be uninsured because it's cheaper to pay a penalty for being uninsured than it is to have healthcare,\" she said. For Ms Bannister's family, the increased cost of healthcare means putting off other spending: \"We were saving for a home, and saving money for that is going to take way longer if we have to spend $11,000 a year on healthcare that we barely use.\"While Ms Bannister is stomaching her new bill, and Ms Martin is going without healthcare, others are resorting to different government programmes to get their coverage. For years, Stephanie Petersen used Medicaid - a healthcare program for lower-income Americans - to get healthcare coverage. Just recently, she was able to switch and get her coverage through the ACA - a welcome change for the 38-year-old. Because her health care is skyrocketing from $75 to $580 a month, she is returning to Medicaid coverage in the New Year.\"I'm trying to stay optimistic but the way things have been going, I'm not hopeful,\" the Illinois resident said. \"Everyone should have affordable, good healthcare, and not have to jump through all these hoops.\"A vote on the three-year extension of the ACA subsidies is now expected the week of 5 January when Congress returns to Washington. Until then, Ms Martin will be one of the more than 27 million Americans without health insurance in 2026. A number that is likely to grow, experts warn, as healthcare costs increase. \"We're not low-income people, we make decent money, but we can't afford $30,000 a year for insurance, that's crazy,\" she said.\"We've done everything we're supposed to do, we've worked our whole lives, we work hard, and we just get screwed. The whole system is a nightmare.\"",

    "body": "1 day agoLaura Gozzi,KyivandJames ChaterUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said a peace agreement to end the war with Russia is \"90% ready\", in a New Year address that largely focused on resistance to Moscow's full-scale invasion.Zelensky said the remaining 10% of the agreement to end nearly four years of conflict would \"determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe\".In his own New Year speech, Russian President Vladimir Putin told his troops that \"we believe in you and our victory\".Earlier on Wednesday, Moscow also released what it said was evidence of Ukraine using drones to target Putin's private home on Lake Valdai in north-west Russia, allegations Kyiv has strenuously denied. It included a map allegedly showing that the drones were launched from the Sumy and Chernihiv regions of Ukraine and a video of a downed drone lying in snowy woodland. A serviceman standing next to the wreckage claims it is a Ukrainian Chaklun drone. The BBC hasn't been able to verify the footage, and it is not possible to locate where it was shot.Russia would review its position on the ongoing peace negotiations as a result of the alleged incident, the Kremlin said.However, Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, on Wednesday described the Russian claims as a \"deliberate distraction\" and an attempt to derail the peace process.In his 20-minute address to the nation, Zelensky said that Ukraine did not want peace \"at any cost\", adding that \"we want the end of the war – not the end of Ukraine\". He said that a Ukrainian withdrawal from the eastern Donbas region means \"everything will be over\", a reference to Russia's maximalist demand that Moscow secure full control of the industrial area in any peace agreement. Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions are known collectively as Donbas.Its fate has been a major obstacle throughout negotiations, with Russia consistently unwilling to compromise on its aim to seize full control of Donbas. In the address, Zelensky thanked leaders that have supported Ukraine, but said that \"intentions must become security guarantees, and therefore - be ratified\". Following talks between Zelensky and his US counterpart Donald Trump in Florida earlier this week, the Ukrainian leader said Washington had offered security guarantees for 15 years - but a time frame for their implementation is not yet clear.\"Signatures under weak agreements only fuel war,\" Zelensky said in his address. \"Either the world stops Russia's war, or Russia drags the world into its war.\"By comparison, Putin's New Year address was much shorter.Addressing the war in Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a \"special military operation\", Putin said: \"We strive to bring joy and warmth through our care for those in need of support and, of course, to stand by our heroes – the participants in the special military operation – in both word and deed.\"Separately, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used his New Year message to praise the \"invincible alliance\" between Pyongyang and Moscow, while praising soldiers who are fighting in \"alien lands\". North Korea has sent thousands of troops to aid Russia in its invasion, along with missiles and long-range weapons, South Korean officials have said. At least 600 of those soldiers have died, according to South Korean estimates. Zelensky has expressed a desire for peace negotiations to resume and accelerate this month with the involvement of both US and European officials.French President Emmanuel Macron said European states and allies who are due to meet in Paris on 6 January \"will make concrete commitments to protect Ukraine and ensure a just and lasting peace on our European continent\".On Wednesday, Trump's advisers held talks with Zelensky and national security advisers from the UK, France and Germany about ending the war in Ukraine.US special envoy Steve Witkoff said they discussed \"strengthening security guarantees and developing effective deconfliction mechanisms to help end the war and ensure it does not restart\".But any deal will ultimately need Russian buy-in, which does not seem forthcoming - and which the alleged drone incident over Putin's residence may have pushed further into the distance.

    "body": "2 days agoMayeni JonesAfrica Correspondent, Cape TownCape Town PelagicsAlbatrosses are particularly vulnerable to being harmed by fishing boatsOn a small boat in the Atlantic, about 27 nautical miles (50km) away from South Africa's Cape Point, a group of bird watchers are calling out seabird names: \"Atlantic yellow-nosed! Black-browed albatross!\"The tour boat takes bird watchers from Cape Town to see endangered seabirds, including albatrosses, that are hard to find on the mainland.It's a warm summer's day and the sky is blue and clear, perfect conditions for bird-watching. The skipper is speaking on his radio - he's looking for fishing trawlers. He soon finds one, and makes a beeline towards it. The closer the boat - operated by Cape Town Pelagics, a non-profit organisation - gets to the fishing vessels, the more seabirds appear. As he stops right next to the fishing boat, hundreds of birds trail behind it.They've learned to associate these boats with food. They follow the trawler, waiting for discarded fish heads and guts which fishermen throw into the sea as they sort through and process their catch.The birds fight over the discarded pieces, occasionally diving into the nets to catch some of the fish there. But looking for food this way can cost these seabirds their lives.\"They get caught on what they call long lines,\" explains Tim Appleton, a British conservationist and the founder of the Global Bird Fair, referring to a commercial fishing method that uses long fishing lines dotted with hooks to catch large fish like tuna.\"Some of these long lines that go out the back of fishing boats are 100 kilometres (62 miles) long. They have 4,000 hooks on them. Every 4,000 hooks are baited with a bit of squid or fish and of course the birds try and get the bait and end up getting caught on the hooks, dragged under and drowned.\"The accidental deaths of animals by fishing boats are called bycatch. And it's not just long-line fishing that kills these birds: they also get tangled in the cable lines that pull the fishing nets up towards the boat.Albatrosses spend almost half of their life on the high seas, making them particularly vulnerable to being injured or killed by fishing boats.Mayeni Jones / BBCAlbatrosses are particularly vulnerable to being injured or killed by fishing boats\"Of all of the groups of birds in the world, the seabirds are one of the most endangered,\" says Andrea Angel. She works for BirdLife South Africa, a conservation organisation, where she leads the Albatross Task Force. For the past 20 years it has been working to stop the birds from being killed by fishing trawlers.\"There are only 22 species of albatrosses globally, 15 of those are threatened by fishing activity. Albatrosses roam the seas and live exclusively on squid, fish and things that they catch in the ocean. So most of their lives are spent at sea, which means that they encounter fishing vessels more than any other bird.\"She adds that albatrosses' mating habits also make them more prone to extinction. They mate for life and only lay one egg every two years which they raise on breeding islands. The parents share responsibility for feeding their chick. \"There's a huge investment in raising that chick, and that investment is made by both of the parents. So when one of them is out following fishing vessels, if one of those parents is injured or dies, the chick back on the island will also die, because the one parent isn't enough to keep up feeding this one chick, and an investment that's taken them two years to lay an egg is completely lost.\"What's worse is that, because albatrosses are monogamous and pair for life, it takes them up to four years to bond with a partner.\"Once that bond breaks through the death of one of the partners, it will take them at least another four or five years to form another bond and begin the ritual of laying eggs again. So the disruption of one bird being lost at sea is tremendous.\"One way to prevent the accidental death of albatrosses at sea is the use of bird-scaring lines: they're essentially nautical scarecrows, scaring the birds away from the nets and fishing lines.Colourful plastic streamers hang above the fishing nets and fishing lines, fluttering in the wind to stop birds from getting caught in them. Made of plastic tubing and rope, they can be cheaply and easily made.Mayeni Jones / BBCBirdLife is collaborating with workers with disabilities to create bird scaring linesBirdLife has been collaborating with disabled workers from the Ocean View Association for Persons with Disabilities, training them to make the bird-scaring lines. \"Ocean View started off as a fishing community,\" says Deborah Gonsalves, the manager of the association, which provides a daycare workshop for people with physical and intellectual disabilities.\"Some of our members were fishermen prior to having a disability. So to see BirdLife partnering with them has been amazing and the members have grown tremendously.\"She says building bird-scaring lines has been an incentive for the members of the association.\"It's actually enabled them to still be productive and it gives them that self-worth. At the moment, as I'm sure in most parts of the world, there is a lack of funding. The economy has taken a knock. The work they do here supplements their disability grant and it gives their loved ones the chance to work while they are being cared for.\"But Andrea Angel says it's not just the workers and the conservation work that benefits from the deployment of bird-scaring lines on fishing vessels, there are economic incentives for fisheries too.\"We call them bird-scaring lines because it's a very evocative name. It tells exactly what they do. But originally they were called tori lines. Tori means bird in Japanese. They were created by a Japanese fisherman in the late 90s, who was tired of catching so many birds in his hooks and losing his catch. Fishermen would rather catch a big tuna than a bird. A tuna is worth around $10,000 (£7,400) and a bird is worth nothing. So the economic incentive for them is huge.\"But she admits that some fishermen faced with time constraints, safety concerns and fishing quotas, don't always use the lines.\"They don't always put out the bird-scaring lines for various reasons. And so it's always a negotiation and a reminder to them to please do so, because they really are saving tens of thousands of bird lives.\"Since the Albatross Task force was set up in 2004, it's seen a 90% reduction in the number of seabirds killed by southern African fisheries. The hope is to replicate its success in other parts of the world to ensure these majestic birds can keep reproducing for years to come.You may also be interested in:I'm not retiring, I'm evolving - KipchogeThe 70s Afro-rock genre enjoying a surprising rebirthGetty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

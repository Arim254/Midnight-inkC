Sausage is not vegan,\" he said recently.</p><p>The French meat industry has also strongly supported the idea. </p><p>Back in 2020, a similar proposal was on the table but it wasn't passed.</p></div>",

Aid convoys carrying food and healthcare have been blocked from reaching civilians.</p><p>\"After over 500 days of unremitting siege by the RSF and incessant fighting, El Fasher is on the precipice of an even greater catastrophe if urgent measures are not taken [to] loosen the armed vice upon the city and to protect civilians,\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said last Thursday.</p></div>",

    "body": "<div><p>French President Emmanuel Macron will name a new prime minister within 48 hours, the Elysee Palace has said, fending off speculation that fresh elections could be imminent.</p><p>Earlier on Wednesday, outgoing Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu said the possibility of dissolving parliament was beginning to fade following talks with political parties over the last two days.</p><p>\"There is a majority in parliament and that is the majority that is keen to avoid fresh elections,\" he said.</p><p>On Monday, Lecornu - a close ally of Macron - became the third French PM to leave his job in less than a year, driven out by a hung parliament deeply divided along ideological lines.</p></div><div><p>He was then asked by Macron to stay on for two days to form a consensus among parties on how to get out of the current political crisis.</p><p>In a much-awaited TV interview on Wednesday evening, Lecornu gave no indication about who the next prime minister would be, and although he said his mission was \"finished\", he also did not appear to rule himself out entirely.</p><p>He said that as well as not wanting fresh elections, most MPs also recognised the pressing need to pass a budget by the end of the year.</p><p>However, he recognised the path towards forming a government was still complicated due to the divisions within parliament and to politicians eyeing the next presidential election.</p><p>Whoever ends up in government \"will need to be completely disconnected from any presidential ambition for 2027,\" said Lecornu, a former armed forces minister.</p><p>France's political stalemate began following snap elections in July 2024. Since then no one party has had a majority, making it difficult to pass any laws or reforms including the yearly budget.</p><p>The big challenge facing Lecornu and his two predecessors has been how to tackle France's crippling national debt, which this year stood at €3.4tn (£2.9tn), or almost 114% of economic output (GDP), the third highest in the eurozone after Greece and Italy.</p><p>Previous prime ministers Michel Barnier and Francois Bayrou were ousted in confidence votes after they presented austerity budgets.</p><p>Lecornu said his own draft budget would be presented next week, although it would be \"open for debate\".</p><p>\"But the debate needs to begin... parties cannot say they'll vote it down without examining it,\" he added.</p><p>Similarly, Lecornu said, one big issue that has been plaguing French politics since 2023 will need to be revisited - Macron's highly contested pension reforms. \"We have to find a way for the debate to take place,\" Lecornu said.</p><p>But some factions in parliament appear immovable from their positions.</p><p>Mathilde Panot of the radical left France Unbowed (LFI) said soon after Lecornu's TV interview that the only solution was \"the resignation and departure of Emmanuel Macron\".</p><p>Meanwhile, far right National Rally's leader Marine Le Pen, who has long been calling for fresh elections, stated on Wednesday that she would vote down any new government.</p><p>It is unclear, at this stage, which political forces would support a new government.</p><p>The so-called common platform of centrists and Republicans that have run the government since last year appears to have fallen apart.</p><p>The big question now is whether over the last 48 hours Lecornu was able to persuade the Socialists, who were part of that left bloc during the elections, to prop up a government in some way.</p><p>Asked about the calls by some political factions for Macron to resign, with even Macron's own former prime minister Edouard Philippe floating the idea earlier this week, Lecornu said France needed a stable, internationally recognised figure at its helm.</p><p>\"This is not the time to change the president,\" Lecornu said.</p><p>However, Macron is appearing increasingly isolated, with even close allies beginning to distance themselves from him.</p><p>Earlier this week Gabriel Attal, widely seen as Macron's protégé, said he \"no longer understood\" Macron and called for the appointment of an independent negotiator to steer the government.</p><p>Macron has not yet spoken publicly since Lecornu's shock resignation on Monday morning. Lecornu promised the president would \"address the French people in due course,\" without specifying when that may be.</p></div>",

Many attendees had the opportunity to ask the president questions or simply share their views - to which he responded.</p><p>\"I don't want flattery. I want to hear the truth. It's the people who kept telling me that everything was fine who are responsible for our current situation,\" he said.</p><p>The movement behind the protest, known as Gen Z Mada, has been calling for the president to resign - and rejected an invitation to attend the talks.</p></div><div><p>They argue that they cannot engage a government that has been repressing them as they demand basic human rights. The group has called for new protests on Thursday.</p><p>\"We refuse the president's invitation to talks. We will not engage in dialogue with a regime that represses, assaults, and humiliates its youth in the streets,\" they wrote on their Facebook page.</p><p>At the expiry of their 48-hour ultimatum for the president to resign, the group called for a nationwide strike, although the details remain unclear.</p><p>They have vowed not to back down, urging people from all regions to join them and declaring that \"the Malagasy people do not submit\".</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz082y8j3jzo\">Behind the Gen Z protesters who want to force Madagascar's president from power</a></li></ul><p>Rajoelina has been holding these meetings as part of his pledge to \"listen more\", emphasising that the challenges facing the Indian Ocean island nation can only be solved through honest conversations and not protests.</p><p>The president assured those at the dialogue that ongoing power projects would address the recurring outages by adding 265 megawatts to the national grid. </p><p>\"I swear that if power cuts persist in the capital within a year, I will resign,\" he said.</p><p>The protests began on 25 September triggered by anger over persistent power and water shortages, and have escalated into broader dissatisfaction over corruption, high unemployment and the cost-of-living crisis.</p><p>Last week, Rajoelina sacked his entire government and appointed an army general as prime minister on Monday. The protest movement rejected the appointment and vowed to continue their struggle.</p><p>Rajoelina came to power in 2009 after leading mass protests that triggered military intervention and overthrew then-President Marc Ravalomanana.</p><p>Although the youth-led movement continues to demand his resignation, street protests appear to have weakened.</p><p>Life in most parts of the capital, Antananarivo, continues as normal, except in a few neighbourhoods with a heavy police presence, where some roads have been blocked or are being closely monitored.</p><p>At least 22 people have died in clashes with security forces and scores more have been injured, according to the United Nations. The authorities have disputed these figures.</p></div>",

The organisation said they were detained some time ago but it was not previously reported.</p><p>Security Minister Mahamadou Sana said the NGO had \"collected and passed on sensitive security information that could be detrimental to national security and the interests of Burkina Faso, to foreign powers\".</p><p>The International NGO Safety Organisation (INSO), which provides safety information to aid workers, has \"categorically\" denied the allegations.</p></div><div><p>Anthony Neal,  a representative of the NGO told the BBC's Newsday programme that its Burkina Faso country director had been detained since July when the organisation was suspended. The seven others were arrested later.</p><p>\"We continue to work towards their safe and immediate release,\" he said.</p><p>The NGO was suspended on 31 July for three months by the authorities for \"collecting sensitive data without authorisation\". It has been working in the country since 2019.</p><p>On Tuesday, the security minister said that despite being banned, members of the organisation had continued to secretly collect information and hold meetings.</p><p>Mr Neal denied the claim, saying its information-collection activities had ceased on 31 July but its staff remained in Burkina Faso to deal with the detention and meet its contractual commitments.</p><p>A statement by the  organisation emphasised that the information it collects was not confidential and was meant for the safety of humanitarian workers.</p><p>It added that the Burkinabé authorities were \"fully aware\" of their work and mandate and had been co-operating with the authorities.</p><p>Mr Neal said he had tried to engage with the government to address any misunderstandings or concerns. He said safety information was critical, with a \"record\" number of aid workers having been killed this year around the world.</p><p>Burkina Faso's military government led by Capt Ibrahim Traore seized power in a coup three years ago, and has had a frosty relationship with Western nations ever since.</p><p>In response to a worsening Islamist insurgency, the junta stopped working with the former colonial power, France, and instead turned to Russia for military assistance.</p><p>Human rights groups have since accused the army of committing abuses against civilians while tackling the militants, and also cracking down on political dissent and freedom of expression.</p></div>",

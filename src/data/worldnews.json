    "body": "11 hours agoGeorge WrightYonhap NewsAll 267 people aboard a South Korean passenger ferry have been rescued after it ran aground on rocks off the country's south-east coast, according to the Coast Guard.Officials said the Queen Jenuvia 2 is stuck on a reef and unable to move, but there is currently no risk of it sinking or capsizing.The accident happened near Jangsan Island in Sinan County on Wednesday evening local time. The vessel ran aground on rocks near the uninhabited island of Jogdo.Twenty-seven people sustained minor injuries from the impact of the grounding, the Cost Guard said, but there have been no other casualties.Some passengers described the incident in real time on social media. \"There was a loud bang, and then the ship tilted,\" one was quoted as saying by South Korea's Yonhap news agency. \"An announcement told everyone to put on life jackets, so we're wearing them and waiting on the top deck.\"The 26,000-tonne ferry was travelling to the port city of Mokpo after departing from the resort island of Jeju, officials said.The area is near the site of the sinking of the Sewol ferry in 2014 that killed more than 300 people, mostly school children heading for a school trip.The salvaged wreck of the Sewol ferry was brought to Mokpo nearly three years later.Kim Namhyun, a diving instructor on Jeju Island, told Reuters: \"I thought I might die. The sound was too loud.\"But having seen the Sewol ferry, I knew that in situations like this, you have to stay calm, move outside, wear a life jacket, and wait.\"The Coast Guard plans to move the vessel ashore at high tide.",

    "body": "The family of a Muslim man, who was lynched by a Hindu mob in India's Uttar Pradesh state in 2015, say they will continue fighting for justice after authorities recently moved to drop all charges against the accused. Mohammad Akhlaq, then 50, was beaten to death after rumours spread that he had stored and consumed beef, a claim his family continues to deny. Slaughter of cows is a sensitive issue in India as the animal is considered sacred by Hindus, who comprise 80% of the country's 1.4 billion people. Uttar Pradesh is among the 20 states with strict laws banning cow slaughter and the sale and consumption of beef.The attack, which took place in Dadri - 49km (31 miles) from the capital Delhi - was the first major and widely reported case of cow-related violence in India and sparked widespread protests. Akhlaq's family's lawyer told BBC Hindi that 18 people were charged for various offences, including murder and rioting. All of them are out on bail.Now the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led state government of Uttar Pradesh has asked a local court to drop the charges against the men. In an application filed last month, the public prosecutor argued there were \"inconsistencies\" in the witness testimonies in identifying the accused and asked the court to close the case. The court is expected to decide on whether it would accept the application on 12 December. The news has shocked Akhlaq's family, who say they are prepared to challenge the government's plea. \"We never thought that our fight of 10 years would be attempted to be closed off like this,\" his younger brother Jaan Mohammad told BBC Hindi. The family left the village shortly after the killing and has not returned.\"Now, we are scared for our safety even more,\" Mr Mohammad said. \"Will this [move to withdraw the case] not embolden the criminals?\" Mr Mohammad says he will never forget the night his brother was murdered. Akhlaq had been sleeping with his 22-year-old son Danish on 28 September 2015, when a mob wielding sticks, swords and cheap pistols barged into their home, accusing the family of having slaughtered a cow and eating it. The family said it later found out that the mob attacked him after an announcement was made from a Hindu temple that someone had slaughtered and eaten a cow. The accused men found some meat in the fridge that the family insists was mutton, and held it as proof. While Akhlaq died on the spot, his son was seriously injured in the attack.The case sparked widespread outrage. Although initial arrests came within a week, the chargesheet took three months to file.Many also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for speaking about the incident days after Akhlaq's death, while some BJP members, then in power at the federal level, were accused of defending the attackers.One party leader had described the lynching as an \"accident\", while another said consuming beef was unacceptable. The police, in its first chargesheet, named 15 main accused, including a juvenile and a local BJP leader's son, along with 25 witnesses. Four more accused were later added, bringing the total to 19; one died in 2016.Last month, the Uttar Pradesh government argued that witnesses, including Akhlaq's family, had given conflicting statements during the investigation.It noted that Akhlaq's wife initially named 10 people in her complaint, while his daughter Shaista cited 16, and his son Danish 19.\"Despite both the parties living in the same village, the witnesses have changed the number of accused,\" the application says.Mohammad Yusuf Saifi, Akhlaq's family lawyer, said the \"chaos and confusion\" at the time of the incident made it understandable that not every witness saw all involved.\"The only thing to see is whether there is any evidence against the people who have been named,\" he said. The application also noted that police seized five sticks, iron rods and bricks from the accused, but found no firearms or swords, contrary to what Akhlaq's wife had stated in her complaint.It further stated that officials had recovered beef from the scene. In 2016, a  case was filed against Akhlaq's family under the cow slaughter law - and is still pending before a court in Uttar Pradesh. The family has however has repeatedly denied the allegation.Mr Saifi, alleged the case was meant to \"pressurise\" the family, noting that a local veterinary report identified the meat as goat, not cow. As the family anxiously waits for the court's verdict, they are holding out hope. \"I still have faith in the court,\" Akhlaq's brother, Mr Mohammad, said. \"I believe justice would be done one day.\"",

    "body": "One of the world's first calculating machines will not go to auction as scheduled, France, after a Paris court provisionally blocked the historic item from being export.Auction house Christie's has confirmed it will not proceed with a bid for the machine La Pascaline, developed by the French mathematician Blaise Pascal in 1642.Valuations suggested the machine could fetch €2 to 3m (£1.77m to £2.65m). Christie's called it the \"most important scientific instrument ever offered at auction\".Scientists and researchers made a legal appeal to grant heritage protections to the historic instrument, arguing it should be classified as a \"national treasure\".Pascal was just 19 years old when he developed the earliest version of a calculator, Christie's said. There are only nine of these machines still in existence.\"It is the first attempt in history to substitute the human mind with a machine,\" the official collection description reads.\"Its invention marks a breakthrough, a 'quantum leap' whose importance and significance take on a very special meaning today\".La Pascaline was exhibited at Christie's venues in New York and Hong Kong throughout the year. The machine was included in Christie's auction of the library of the late Catalonia collector Léon Parcé, which also featured Pascal's philosophical piece Pensées and the first printed version of \"Pascal's wager\".On Wednesday, a Paris administrative court temporarily blocked an earlier export authorisation provided by France's culture minister in May. Two experts had signed off on the minister's certificate, including one from the Louvre Museum.The judge concluded there were \"serious doubts\" over the legality of the certificate, a statement from the Paris court said, adding the decision was provisional until a final judgment is delivered.In a statement to the AFP news agency, a Christie's spokesperson said: \"Given the provisional nature of this decision and in accordance with the instructions of its client, Christie's is suspending the sale of La Pascaline\". The court noted La Pascaline's historic and scientific value could qualify as a \"national treasure\" guaranteeing protections under the France's heritage code.French heritage group, Association Sites & Monuments, which was listed as an applicant, welcomed the decision.with additional reporting by Sebastian Usher, Global Affairs reporter",

    "body": "9 hours agoRushdi Abualouf,Gaza correspondent, in Istanbul and David GrittenAt least 25 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip, the Hamas-run health ministry has said. Ten people, including a woman and a young girl, were killed when a ministry of religious endowments building in the eastern Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City was hit, according to rescuers.The Israeli military said it had struck \"Hamas terrorist targets\" after it said gunmen had opened fire towards an area where its soldiers were operating in the southern city of Khan Younis, in violation of the five-week-old ceasefire agreement.There was no immediate comment from Hamas.The flare-up of violence comes after the UN Security Council passed a resolution that endorsed US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan to end two years of devastating war.Mahmoud Bassal, a spokesman for Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency, told the BBC that Israeli air, drone and artillery strikes hit several locations in Gaza City and Khan Younis shortly after sunset on Wednesday.The attacks marked a sharp escalation after several days of relative calm, he said.The Civil Defence reported that the strike in Zeitoun caused severe damage to the religious endowments ministry's building and surrounding structures, and posted a video showing its rescue workers appearing to find two people buried under rubble.Photos published by the Anadolu news agency meanwhile showed the bodies of three young children reportedly recovered from the scene.In a separate incident in Gaza City, one person was killed and several others were wounded when a drone struck a group of people at Shejaiya junction on Salah al-Din Street, Gaza's main north-south road, according to Mr Bassal.He said another person was killed when a tank shell struck a house belonging to the Balboul family in Shejaiya's Mushtaha Street, which is also in eastern Gaza City.In Khan Younis, three people were killed and a number were wounded in a strike on a group inside a sports club run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), he added.In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that \"several terrorists opened fire toward the area where IDF soldiers are operating in Khan Younis\" earlier on Wednesday.\"This action constitutes a violation of the ceasefire agreement. No IDF injuries were reported,\" it added. \"In response, the IDF began striking Hamas terrorist targets across the Gaza Strip.\"Israeli public broadcaster Kan cited a security source as saying the targets of the strikes were the commander of the Zeitoun Battalion of Hamas's military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, and the commander of its naval force.On Monday, the UN Security Council passed a resolution that sought to shore up the fragile ceasefire, which took effect on 10 October.Member states authorised the creation of a transitional governance body called the Board of Peace, which will be chaired by President Trump, and a temporary International Stabilisation Force (ISF), which will be tasked with ensuring \"the process of demilitarizing the Gaza Strip\".Trump hailed the resolution as \"a moment of true historic proportion\".A Hamas statement reiterated that the group would not give up its weapons without a Palestinian state, arguing its fight against Israel was legitimate \"resistance\".Israel's ambassador to the UN stressed the importance of disarmament, saying that his country would \"not stop or let up\" until Hamas no longer presented \"a threat\".The Israeli military launched an offensive in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 69,500 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, including 280 during the ceasefire, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "A portrait by the Austrian artist Gustav Klimt was sold for $236.4m (£179m) in New York on Tuesday, making it the second most expensive piece ever sold at auction. Six people took part in a 20-minute bidding battle for the Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer which was painted between 1914 and 1916. Auction house Sotheby's has not disclosed the buyer's identity.The portrait was looted by the Nazis and almost destroyed in a fire in World War Two, but was rescued in 1948. The artwork was returned to Lederer's brother, Erich, a friend and subject of Klimt's contemporary, Egon Schiele. The piece remained in Lederer's possession for most of his life, before he sold it in 1983, according to Sotheby's. The painting shows Lederer, an heiress and the daughter of one of Klimt's patrons, wearing a white robe and standing in front of a blue tapestry covered in Asian motifs. The Nazis, who annexed Austria in 1938, looted the Lederer art collection but left family portraits behind, says the National Gallery of Canada. Estée Lauder heir Leonard A Lauder made it part of his private collection in 1985, where it was displayed in his Fifth Avenue home in New York. Tuesday's sale shot past expectations, with the painting predicted to sell for  $150m before the auction. The second highest sale for a Klimt on record was Lady with a Fan, which sold for $108.8m in 2023 in London. Several other Klimt works in Lauder's collection were auctioned at the same event, including Flowering Meadow and Forest Slope at Unterach am Attersee, which fetched between $60m and $80m each. The most expensive artwork ever sold at auction was Salvator Mundi, attributed to  Leonardo da Vinci, which sold in 2017 for $450.3m.Tuesday also saw a sculpture of a fully functioning gold toilet by the conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan picking up $12.1m just an hour after the record-breaking Klimt sale.The 101-kg toilet received just one bid. Sotheby's said that the buyer was a famous American brand.",

    "body": "5 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterEPAAlbania's prime minister accused Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood of \"ethnic stereotyping\" after she singled out Albanian families in a speech about abuses of the asylum system.Edi Rama criticised Mahmood for telling MPs around 700 Albanian families were \"living in taxpayer-funded accommodation having failed their asylum claims\" as she announced major reforms on Monday.Rama called the number a \"statistical drop in the ocean of post-Brexit Britain's challenges\".Official data show the UK has deported more than 13,000 people to Albania since a returns deal was signed in 2022. Rama called the deal one of \"Europe's most successful partnerships on illegal migration.\"Mahmood's comments came as she announced major changes to the UK's \"out of control and unfair\" asylum system.Speaking in the House of Commons, Mahmood said: \"If we fail to deal with this crisis, we will draw more people down a path that starts with anger and ends in hatred.\"The reforms will make refugee status temporary, extend the wait for permanent settlement from five years to 20, and allow the removal of families with children who have no right to remain. Alongside tightening access to refugee status, the UK would create new legal routes to the UK, with an annual cap on numbers.As part of her speech, Mahmood told MPs \"we must remove those who have failed asylum claims, regardless of who they are\".\"There are, for instance, around 700 Albanian families living in taxpayer-funded accommodation having failed their asylum claims - despite an existing returns agreement, and Albania being a signatory to the European convention on human rights,\" she added.Posting on social media, Rama said: \"How can a Labour Home Secretary so poorly echo the rhetoric of the populist far-right – and single out 700 Albanian families, a statistical drop in the ocean of post-Brexit Britain's challenges – precisely at a moment when the UK and Albania have built one of Europe's most successful partnerships on illegal migration?\"\"Let us also be clear: Albanians are net contributors to the British economy, and the number of Albanians receiving UK benefits is very low relative to other communities. \"To single them out again and again is not policy - it is a troubling and indecent exercise in demagoguery.\"Official policy should never be driven by ethnic stereotyping. That is the very least humanity expects from the great Great Britain.\"Rama has repeatedly clashed with British politicians over their descriptions of Albanian nationals. In May, Sir Keir Starmer travelled to the Albanian capital Tirana only to be told by Rama he would not host UK \"return hubs\" for failed asylum seekers from other countries.During the same press conference, Rama accused the previous Conservative government of \"stigmatising\" Albanians and warning that \"cursing the Albanians was not a good idea, because the curse went back and they are now out of the parliament\".A combative figure on social media, Rama has also previously invited Reform UK leader Nigel Farage to come to Albania to debate his claim one in 50 Albanians in Britain were in prison. Rama dismissed the figure as \"bonkers\" and accused Farage of peddling \"post-truth Brexit playbook\" politics. ",

    "body": "9 hours agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor and Guy Delauney,Balkans correspondentAFPThe club's owner, nearest the camera, is among those on trialThirty-five people and three institutions have gone on trial in North Macedonia over a devastating fire at a nightclub that killed 63, mainly young, people in March.\"I know about the pain of loved ones, we are all parents,\" Judge Diana Gruevska-Ilievska told the crowded courtroom, filled with defendants and dozens of victims' relatives. She promised the case would be conducted in a transparent and disciplined manner.Club Pulse, in the eastern town of Kocani, was packed with young Macedonians attending a concert by a popular hip-hop duo when sparks from pyrotechnic devices set fire to the ceiling.Prosecutors told the trial that years of failings had turned the club into a death trap.Three former mayors of Kocani, the nightclub's owner and public licensing officials are among those charged. They are accused of endangering public safety by allowing an unsafe venue to operate. The judge warned the court that the trial could last for \"five months or five years\".Defence lawyers attempted to delay the start of proceedings due to the charges being merged into a single case. The judge rebuffed them, ruling this did \"not violate any rights of the parties\".At the time of the tragedy, authorities said only one proper exit was functioning at the club as the back door had been locked.Sparks from the pyrotechnics spread quickly on the club's ceiling, which had been made of flammable material.About 500 people were inside the club at the time, leaving 59 dead and some 200 others injured. Four of the injured died later. Many were unable to escape because of blocked exits.Outrage after the fire prompted protests in the Macedonian capital Skopje and elsewhere, with victims' families organising local marches in Kocani itself. AFP via Getty ImagesLast Saturday, victims' families marched through the centre of Skopje holding pictures of those who diedAnother protest entitled \"March of the Angels\" took place in Skopje days before the trial began, organised under a Macedonian social media campaign called \"Who's Next?\". Prosecutors told the trial that the Kocani disaster was not the result of one person's actions or mistakes - rather it arose out of a series of institutional failures and a lack of responsibility.None of the defendants had wanted to face up to the danger that had been there for years, according to prosecutor Borche Janev.Prosecutors allege that licences for the club were issued unlawfully, inspections were not carried out and overcrowding was allowed at the venue. Another allegation is that there was no permit for the band to set off the pyrotechnic devices that started the fire.\"If we remain silent and lose the truth... we will never have the strength as a society to embark on a path to healing,\" Janev was quoted by local media as telling the court.",

    "body": "Two Miss Universe judges have resigned days before the annual beauty pageant, with one of them accusing organisers of rigging the selection process.Lebanese-French musician Omar Harfouch, who announced his resignation from the eight-member jury on Instagram, alleged that an \"impromptu jury\" had pre-selected finalists ahead of the competition, set to be held on Friday in Thailand.Hours later, French football manager Claude Makélélé also announced he'd pulled out, citing \"unforeseen personal reasons\".The resignations come two weeks after several Miss Universe contestants walked out of a pre-pageant event over controversial comments made by an official from host nation Thailand.\"An impromptu jury has been formed to select 30 finalists from among the 136 participating countries, without the presence of any of the real [eight] members of the jury, including me,\" Mr Harfouch wrote in an Instagram post on Tuesday, saying he had discovered this via social media.The unofficial jury comprises \"individuals with a significant potential conflict of interest due to some personal relationships with some of the Miss Universe contestants\", he claimed.Mr Harfouch did not elaborate on how this \"impromptu jury\" would function, or how it would override the official jury's decision.Watch: Miss Universe contestants stage walkout after organiser berates Miss MexicoThe Miss Universe Organisation on Tuesday put out a statement to rebuff Mr Harfouch's claims, saying that \"no external group has been authorised to evaluate delegates or select finalists\". It suggested that Mr Harfouch may have been referring to the Beyond the Crown programme: a \"social impact initiative\" that operates independently from the Miss Universe competition, and has a separate selection committee. The Miss Universe Organisation announced the Beyond the Crown selection committee on Monday. In its statement on Tuesday, the organisation said that Mr Harfouch's allegations had \"mischaracterised\" the programme.Mr Makélélé, who also announced his resignation via Instagram, described it as a \"difficult decision\". \"I hold Miss Universe in the highest regard. The platform represents empowerment, diversity, and excellence - values I have always championed throughout my career,\" he wrote.The beauty pageant drew backlash earlier this month after its Thailand director Nawat Itsaragrisil publicly berated Miss Mexico, Fatima Bosch, at a pre-pageant event for not posting promotional content on her social media platforms.In videos that have since gone viral, Ms Bosch and several other contestants could be seen walking out of the event, and some could be heard shouting at Mr Nawat.Mr Nawat later claimed that some of his words were misunderstood - but his conduct nevertheless prompted a stern rebuke from the Miss Universe Organisation, which has since sent a delegation of international executives to take over running the competition.",

    "body": "Senior Pentagon officials have arrived in Ukraine to \"discuss efforts to end the war\" with Russia, the US military has said.The team, led by US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, is expected to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Thursday when he returns from a trip to Turkey.Reports began surfacing on Wednesday that the US and Russia had prepared a new peace plan, containing major concessions from Ukraine. Neither Washington nor Moscow has officially confirmed the plan.Earlier in the day, at least 26 people were killed in a Russian missile and drone attack on Ukraine's western city of Ternopil, officials there said. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. \"Secretary Driscoll and team arrived this morning in Kyiv on behalf of the administration on a factfinding mission to meet Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war,\" Army spokesman Col David Butler said in a statement.Driscoll is joined by the US Army's chief of staff Gen Randy George, top US army commander in Europe Gen Chris Donahue, and Srg Maj of the Army Michael Weimer.Driscoll and Gen George are the most senior US military officials to hold talks in the Ukrainian capital since President Donald Trump took office in January.An image on Wednesday showed Driscoll meeting and shaking hands with Ukrainian Defence Minister Denys Shmyhal.In a post on X afterwards, Shmyhal said: \"We focused on the next steps for implementing the historic defence agreements reached by President Zelensky and President Trump\".He also thanked Washington for \"approving the sale of a support package for the PATRIOT air-defence system worth approximately $105m (£80m)\".Earlier, a Ukrainian official told CBS, the BBC's US media partner, that talks on the trip would focus on the military situation on the ground - as well as plans for a possible ceasefire. The official - who was not named - said: \"Presidents Zelensky and Trump have already agreed to stop the conflict along the existing lines of engagement, and there are agreements on granting security guarantees\".It comes as a number of outlets are reporting that the US and Russia have privately drawn up proposals on how to end the war.Citing people familiar with the matter, Axios, the Financial Times and Reuters reported that the plans call for Kyiv to give up some territories and weapons, as well as to significantly cut Ukraine's Armed Forces.Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian leader Vladimir Putin's envoy Kirill Dmitriev are believed to have been involved in working on the 28-point peace plan.The BBC has asked the White House and a representative for Witkoff to comment.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov appeared to downplay the reports.\"In this case, we have no additional innovations to what we call 'the spirit of Anchorage',\" he told Russia's state-run media on Wednesday - referring to the August summit between Putin and Trump in the US state of Alaska.Any agreements reached during the one-day meeting have not been made public.President Zelensky has repeatedly ruled out any territorial concessions to Russia.Kyiv and its Western allies, including the US, have been calling for an immediate ceasefire along the vast front line, but Moscow has ruled that out, repeating demands that Ukraine says amount to its de facto capitulation.Earlier this month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow's pre-conditions for a peace deal - including ceding territory, tough curbs on the size of Ukraine's military and the country's neutrality - had not changed since Putin laid them out two months before the full-scale invasion.Meanwhile, a White House official confirmed to the BBC that special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg will leave his post in January.He reportedly decided that this would be a natural end to his time in the post, which requires Senate approval beyond 360 days.Kellogg has been seen as an important advocate for Ukraine in the White House during a time when Trump has often appeared to side with Russia in the conflict.

    "body": "3 hours agoMatt McGrathEnvironment correspondent, at COP30 in Belém, BrazilChris McGrath/Getty ImagesTurkey has proposed holding the 2026 climate talks in AntalyaThe COP31 climate meeting is now expected to be held in Turkey after Australia dropped its bid to host the annual event.Under the UN rules, the right to host the COP in 2026 falls to a group of countries made up of Western Europe, Australia and others.A consensus must be reached but neither country had been willing to concede. Australia has now agreed to support the Turkish bid in return for their minister chairing the talks following negotiations at COP30, currently being held in Brazil.This unusual arrangement has taken observers by surprise. It is normal for a COP president to be from the host country and how this new partnership will work in practice remains to be seen.Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has called the compromise with Turkey an \"outstanding result\" in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), noting Pacific issues would be \"front and centre\".He added that he had spoken to Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape and Prime Minister Rabuka of Fiji.However, Papua New Guinea's Foreign Minister Justin Tkatchenko told the AFP news agency \"we are all not happy. And disappointed it's ended up like this\".Solomon Islands leader Jeremiah Manele earlier told the ABC he would be \"disappointed\" if Australia didn't secure the event. Despite this, there will be relief among countries currently meeting at COP30 in the Brazilian city of Belém that a compromise has been reached as the lack of agreement on the venue was becoming an embarrassment for the UN.Australia has pushed hard to have the climate summit in the city of Adelaide, arguing that they would co-host the meeting with Pacific island states who are seen as among the most vulnerable to climate change and rising sea levels.Turkey, which has proposed hosting COP31 in the city of Antalya, felt that they had a good claim to be the host country as they had stood aside in 2021 and allowed the UK to hold the meeting in Glasgow.If neither country was willing to compromise then the meeting would have been held in the German city of Bonn, the headquarters of the UN's climate body.As a result of discussions at COP30, a compromise appears to have been reached.This includes pre-COP meeting will be held on a Pacific island, while the main event is held in Turkey. Australia's climate minister Chris Bowen will be its president. AFP via Getty ImagesAustralia's climate minister Chris Bowen will be the COP30 president\"Obviously, it would be great if Australia could have it all, but we can't have it all,\" Mr Bowen told reporters outside the Australian delegation offices here in Belém.\"This process works on consensus, and consensus means if someone objected to our bid, it would go to Bonn.\"\"That would mean 12 months with a lack of leadership, no COP president in place, no plan, that would be irresponsible for multilateralism in this challenging environment.\"Mr Bowen believes having a COP president not from the host country will work and that he will have the considerable authority reserved for the president of these gatherings.\"As COP president of negotiations, I would have all the powers of the COP presidency to manage, to handle the negotiations, to appoint co-facilitators, to prepare draft text, to issue the cover decision,\" he said.He also confirmed to the BBC that Turkey will also appoint a president who will run the venue, organise the meetings and schedules.Australia's climbdown will be embarrassing for the government of Mr Albanese, after lobbying long and hard to win support among the other nations in the Western Europe group.The compromise will have to be ratified by more than 190 countries gathered here for COP30.Given the difficulties in getting to this compromise, there are unlikely to be any objections.",

    "body": "11 hours agoDearbail Jordan and Simon AtkinsonYounger Australian teenagers on Instagram, Facebook and Threads are being told their accounts will be shut down ahead of the country's social media ban for under-16s.Meta, which owns the three brands, said it had begun notifying users it believes to be between 13 and 15 years old by text, email and in-app messages that their accounts would start being deactivated from 4 December.The ban in Australia comes into force on 10 December. It affects a number of platforms which also include TikTok, YouTube, X and Reddit.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the \"world-leading\" ban was aimed at \"letting kids be kids\". Meta and other firms oppose the measure but said they would comply. Australia's internet regulator has estimated there are 150,000 Facebook users and 350,000 teens on Instagram in the 13-15 age bracket.From 4 December, children aged below 16 will not be able to create accounts on Meta's social media platforms. The company said it was asking young users to update their contact details so they could be notified when they became eligible to open an account. They can download and save their posts, videos and messages before their accounts are shut down.Meta said that teens who said they were old enough to use Instagram, Facebook and Threads could challenge the restriction by taking a \"video selfie\" to be used in facial age scans.They could also provide a driver's licence or other government issued-ID.All these verification methods were tested by the UK-based Age Check Certification Scheme (ACCS) earlier this year, in a report commissioned by the Australian state.While the ACCS said that all methods had their merits, it added: \"We did not find a single ubiquitous solution that would suit all use cases, nor did we find solutions that were guaranteed to be effective in all deployments.\"Social media platforms which fail to take \"reasonable steps\" to block under-16s face fines of up to A$50m (£25m). \"While we are working hard to remove all users who we understand to be under the age of 16 by 10 December, compliance with the law will be an ongoing and multi-layered process,\" Antigone Davis, vice-president and global head of safety at Meta, told Reuters Financial.Meta wants to see a law where under-16s have to get parental approval before they download a social media app. The firm told Australia's Seven News: \"Teens are resourceful, and may attempt to circumvent age assurance measures to access restricted services.\"But it said: \"We're committed to meeting our compliance obligations and are taking the necessary steps to comply with the law.\"Australia's e-Safety Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said the ban was aimed at proctecting teens \"from pressures and risks they can be exposed to while logged in to social media accounts\".In a move seemingly to avoid being included in the ban, gaming platform Roblox this week announced that children under 16 would be unable to chat to adult strangers.Mandatory age checks will be introduced for accounts using chat features, starting in December for Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, then the rest of the globe from January.The e-safety commissioner has published a list of which social media platforms will be impacted by the age ban.They are: FacebookInstagramKickRedditSnapchatThreadsTikTokX (formerly Twitter)YouTubePlatforms not included are:DiscordGitHubGoogle ClassroomLEGO PlayMessengerRobloxSteam and Steam ChatWhatsAppYouTube Kids",

    "body": "Nearly every Republican in the US House of Representatives voted on a bill  to compel the release of documents tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The lone \"nay\" came from the Republican lawmaker from Louisiana, Clay Higgins, who defied his party saying his vote was a principled \"NO\".\"What was wrong with the bill three months ago is still wrong today,\" Higgins wrote on X. \"It abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure in America.\"The resounding vote in favour of the Epstein bill, 427-1, marks a rare moment of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill. Hours later, the US senate too approved the legislation, clearing the way for the final act - President Donald Trump's signature. For Higgins, safeguarding the personal information of Epstein's many victims was the primary issue with the legislation.\"As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people – witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc,\" he wrote on X. \"If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt.\"  Higgins said he would support the bill if it were to be amended by the Senate, which Republican majority leader John Thune had already suggested was unlikely. \"When a bill comes out of the House 427 to 1 and the president said he's going to sign it, I'm not sure that amending it is in the cards,\" Thune said before the Senate's unanimous approval for the bill on Tuesday.Prior to the House passing the legislation, only four Republicans had joined all Democrats in signing a petition to force a vote - Thomas Massie, Lauren Boebert, Nancy Mace and Marjorie Taylor Greene.But it achieved overwhelming Republican support after President Trump dropped his opposition to a vote.Higgins has represented Louisiana's third district since 2017 and is widely regarded as one of the most conservative members of Congress, according to his website.His holdout vote in the wake of 200-plus members of his party voting otherwise is not the first time he has taken an unorthodox stance.In 2024, House Republicans voted to censure Higgins for offensive remarks he made on social media after he called Haiti \"the nastiest country in the western hemisphere\" and referred to Haitians as \"eating pets\" and \"slapstick gangsters\". \"All these thugs better get their mind right and their ass out of our country before January 20th,\" Higgins wrote.Facebook removed two posts from Higgins in 2020, after he wrote he would \"drop any 10 of you where you stand\", referring to any armed protesters that might attend a Louisiana demonstration against police brutality.Facebook told Business Insider at the time the posts \"were removed for violating our policies against inciting violence\". Before Congress, Higgins was a member of Louisiana's St Landry's Parish Sheriff's Office. He resigned in 2016 amid backlash about a controversial anti-crime video where he was seen holding a rifle and making threats against gang members. The BBC has contacted Higgins's office for comment.

    "body": "6 hours agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent, RomeDanish Defence HandoutThe Nord Stream pipeline, which runs between Russia and Germany under the Baltic Sea, was attacked in 2022 Italy's top appeals court has ruled that a Ukrainian man suspected of involvement in blowing up the Nord Stream gas pipelines between Russia and Germany should be extradited to Berlin.There, former Ukrainian military officer Serhiy Kuznetsov will face a charge of anti-constitutional sabotage. He is due to be removed from Italy under German police escort in the next few days.Prosecutors believe Mr Kuznetsov coordinated and led a group that planted explosives on the pipes deep beneath the Baltic Sea in 2022, though they have not disclosed any evidence.The case has serious implications for relations between Ukraine and Germany, which is the biggest source of military aid for Kyiv in Europe.Mr Kuznetsov's lawyer said his client \"feels like a scapegoat\" and is \"very sad\" that his government has not spoken out in his defence, or even confirmed that he was a serving soldier at the time of the blasts.\"If he carried out the attack, then he did so because he was ordered to do so because he was for sure a captain of the Ukrainian army,\" Nicola Canestrini said after Wednesday's hearing.The BBC has seen a copy of Mr Kuznetsov's military ID among the court papers. He has not commented publicly on whether he was involved in the explosions.\"The Ukrainian government knows exactly where he was every day of September 2022,\" his lawyer said. \"So, if he's innocent, why don't they say it? If he did it, why don't they say it? That's his question.\"The BBC has approached government and security sources in Kyiv, but they have not commented.Mr Kuznetsov was arrested in northern Italy in late August, at a glamping site near the city of Rimini where he had booked in for a few nights with his wife and two of their children.His passport details were entered online at check-in, and in Italy that information is automatically transferred to the carabinieri, the local police.Later that night, officers came knocking at the family's door.Serhiy Kuznetsov's lawyer Nicola Canestrini says his client feels like a \"scapegoat\"A month later, a second Ukrainian suspect was detained at his home close to Poland's capital Warsaw on another arrest warrant issued by Germany.Volodymyr Zhuravlyov, an amateur deep-sea diver, has lived in Poland with his family since just before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.He was held in custody for 17 days, but a court then refused to extradite him.The judge delivered a passionate speech, arguing that no Ukrainian could be prosecuted for what he characterised as a legitimate act of self-defence against Russia's \"bloody and genocidal\" invasion of Ukraine.In Italy, further from Ukraine, the mood and the politics are very different.Mr Canestrini described the Italian appeal court's ruling as a \"great disappointment\", but said the fight for his client would now move to Germany - with the aim of having Mr Kuznetsov acquitted on the same grounds.Many Ukrainians consider whoever did destroy Nord Stream to be heroes for taking out an important revenue source for Russia, and struggle to understand why Germany - a key ally of Ukraine - is pursuing this prosecution.On Wednesday, one man stood outside the palatial courthouse in Rome wrapped in a Ukrainian flag and holding a poster that read: \"Serhiy Kuznetsov is a defender, not a criminal.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoJonathan Beale,Defence correspondent in Kyiv and Mattea BubaloAt least 26 people have been killed including three children in a Russian missile and drone attack that hit two blocks of flats in the western city of Ternopil, Ukrainian officials say.They say another 93 people were wounded, 18 of them children, in the strike early on Wednesday - one of the deadliest in the region since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.Ukraine's air force later said Russian X-101 cruise missiles had hit the residential flats. The neighbouring Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk regions were also struck, and a drone attack on three districts of the north-eastern city of Kharkiv wounded more than 30 people. Photos posted online showed buildings and cars ablaze. Ukraine's air force said it had shot down 442 of 476 drones and 41 of 48 missiles launched by Russia, including 10 missiles destroyed by F-16 and Mirage 2000 fighter jets supplied to Kyiv by its Western allies. But in a reference to how stretched Ukraine's air defences currently are, the air force pleaded for \"the uninterrupted and timely supply of aviation weapons from Western partners\".Ternopil, a city closer to the Polish border than the capital Kyiv, has rarely faced attacks since the full-scale invasion. Social media footage of this strike shows missiles shooting across the sky towards the city, though very little sign of air defences reacting from the ground.The devastation caused by the Russian strikes on Ternopil soon became clear. A video shared by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky showed one of the blocks of flats had completely caved in. Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said it had been destroyed between the third and ninth floors.The attack had caused \"significant destruction\", said Zelensky, and many victims were reported to be in the rubble. Plumes of smoke poured from windows and small fires burned outside the tenement. A giant smoke cloud rose in the distance behind the Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Ternopil, as sirens blared throughout the city. With limited defence systems, and a vast country to defend every night, no matter how effective Ukraine becomes at shooting down Russian missiles and drones, there is always a risk some will get through – to devastating effect, as happened in Ternopil.Energy facilities, transport and civil infrastructure were damaged elsewhere in western Ukraine.The energy sector came under attack in Ivano-Frankivsk region where two of the three people reported wounded were children. The head of Lviv region said an energy facility had been struck. Russia has recently upped its attacks on Ukraine's energy grid - as the fourth winter of the war approaches - hoping to damage morale as well as logistics and Ukraine's own defence industry.Electrical supplies are already being rationed and, after the latest attacks, the energy ministry announced more power cuts across the country.Russia's defence ministry said it had carried out its \"massive strike using long-range precision weapons\", claiming it had targeted Ukraine's \"military-industrial complex and energy sector\" in response to Ukrainian attacks on \"civilian targets\".Ukraine's military said on Tuesday it had fired US-supplied longer-range Atacms missiles at military targets inside Russia, the first time they had admitted using Atacms on Russian soil.Russia's defence ministry accused Ukraine of firing four of the missiles at the southern city of Voronezh but said they had all been shot down by air defences. Meanwhile, Zelensky has travelled to the Turkish capital Ankara, in an attempt to revive a US bid to end the war. He held talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan amid reports President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff has been working on a plan with Russian counterpart Kirill Dmitriev.The Kremlin said earlier that no Russian representative would be joining the talks in Ankara. Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman appeared to dismiss US media reports that Washington and Moscow had been working on a peace plan for Ukraine - without any involvement of Kyiv and its European allies.\"In this case, we have no additional innovations to what we call 'the spirit of Anchorage',\" Dmitry Peskov told Russia's state-run media, referring to the August summit between Putin and Trump in the US state Alaska. Any agreements reached during the one-day meeting have not been made public.Peskov's comments came as Zelensky was reportedly due to meet two top US army officials in Kyiv on Thursday. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and Army Chief of Staff General Randy George are the most senior US military officials to visit the Ukrainian capital since President Donald Trump took office, Reuters reports. In a separate development, Romania's defence ministry said a Russian drone had flown about 8km (5 miles) through its airspace in the early hours of Wednesday. The drone then crossed into Ukraine and Moldova before returning to Romania, it said.Romanian and German air force planes were scrambled in response to the incursion and the defence ministry said it was unclear where the drone had come down.Poland also deployed jets early on Wednesday and temporarily closed two airports in the southeast in response to the strikes in western Ukraine.As the fourth anniversary of the start of Russia's full-scale invasion approaches next February, Moscow and Kyiv remain fundamentally opposed in their views of how to end the war.Ukraine and its Western allies, including the US, have called for an immediate ceasefire along the vast front line – but Russia has repeatedly ruled that out, repeating demands that Ukraine says amount to its de facto capitulation.Earlier this month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow's pre-conditions for a peace deal - including tough curbs on the size of Ukraine's military and the country's neutrality - had not changed since Putin laid them out two months before the full-scale invasion.",

    "body": "1 day agoRaghvendra RaoBBC Hindi, BiharSeraj AliLalmunni Devi, who lost her husband to toxic liquor in 2022, says alcohol abuse upended her lifeNine years after imposing a statewide alcohol ban to curb addiction, domestic violence, and financial ruin among its poorest families, Bihar - India's poorest state - still struggles to gauge the policy's effectiveness.The gaps in implementation became glaring as the BBC shadowed Bihar officials in a misty October morning raid on bootleggers.Armed excise officers, with a sniffer dog, sped across the Ganges on a boat to raid an illegal distillery.On reaching the outskirts of the capital, Patna, the team found a ramshackle setup of a dozen metal drums - part of a makeshift apparatus fermenting jaggery, a type of cane sugar, into country liquor.Vapour rose from the drums embedded in the riverside mud, the surfaces still warm.The officers said the site was active minutes earlier, but the alcohol-makers had fled by the time they arrived. \"They often get tipped off before a raid,\" an officer who didn't wish to be named said. Despite these enforcement gaps, alcohol prohibition remains firmly in place in Bihar.Passed in 2016 by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar after persistent demands from women's groups, the law was among the factors that helped his Janata Dal (United) - Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alliance clinch a decisive state election victory earlier this month.State officials tout the policy's success by pointing to big numbers: since the law took effect, 1.1 million cases have been registered and 650,000 people convicted for violations. But the devil lies in the detail.More than 99% of these convictions are for consumption, rather than production, selling, or transport of illicit liquor. Moreover, alcohol remains widely available in the black market in Bihar. In the six weeks leading to the recently held election, illicit alcohol worth more than 522 million rupees ($6.26 million, £4.96 million) was seized from across the state. Seraj AliA makeshift setup of metal drums fermenting jaggery into country liquorSo why has Bihar been unable to enforce its ban more effectively?Local police, who did not want to come on record, say it is a combination of several factors - including staff shortages, increasingly sophisticated smuggling methods and possible collusion between liquor makers and authorities.\"There are laws that prescribe life imprisonment or even the death penalty for murder. But does that stop people from committing murder? No, it doesn't,\" said Ratnesh Sada, an outgoing minister whose department handled prohibition issues.Mr Sada, however, insisted that action has been taken against at least a hundred individuals engaged in illegal alcohol trade, with their properties seized.\"We destroy these setups, but within days they are up and running again,\" said Sunil Kumar, an excise official.Bihar's geography makes enforcement even harder. The landlocked state borders Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and West Bengal -  all of which allow alcohol and serve as major sources of smuggled liquor. It also shares a 726km (449 mile), largely porous border with Nepal, which officials say has become a key conduit for alcohol smuggling, further complicating enforcement.Seraj AliBihar has a thriving black market in locally-brewed alcoholDespite the challenges, many women in Bihar -  who still carry deep scars from their husbands' alcohol abuse -  want the ban to continue.In Chhapra district, Lalmunni Devi, who lost her husband after he consumed toxic liquor in 2022, said her life had been upended by alcohol abuse.\"I just hope no one else has to suffer the same fate,\" she said.Neetu Devi, another widow, broke down as she recalled her husband's death.\"If the government were to shut down all such factories entirely, it [liquor] would no longer be available. It continues to be produced, and that's why people keep consuming it,\" she said.Rajeev Kamal Kumar, an anthropologist at Patna's AN Sinha Institute of Social Sciences, who worked on a government study of prohibition, says both sides of the story are true.\"Many women and elders say prohibition has improved household finances, children's education, and nutrition. But it is undeniable that illegal trade continues,\" he said.Bihar is neither the first nor the only Indian state to impose prohibition; several others have tried it over the years. But such measures often trigger unintended consequences - from thriving black markets and deaths from illicit brews, to enforcement challenges that drain state resources.The financial cost has also been considerable, as alcohol taxes remain a key source of revenue for many state governments.Gujarat and Nagaland have had bans since 1960 and 1989, yet both still grapple with bootlegging.Mizoram imposed prohibition in 1997, lifted it in 2015, reinstated it in 2019, and then relaxed it again in 2022 to allow the manufacture, sale and export of wine made from local grapes.Some other states have rolled back prohibition after encountering economic and administrative challenges.For now, with the outgoing government slated to return to power, prohibition will remain in Bihar. But the policy remains a paradox - hailed as a social reform by some, criticised as ineffective by others.Whether it has succeeded or merely shifted the problem underground is a question that continues to haunt the state.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

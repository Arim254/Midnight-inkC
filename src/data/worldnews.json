    "body": "15 hours agoGeorge WrightAFP via Getty ImagesMany are still being treated in hospital for severe burns sustained in the fire at Le Constellation barA teenager who was injured when a deadly bar fire broke out in a Swiss ski resort on New Year's Eve has died in hospital, taking the death toll to 41, the local public prosecutor announced.\"An 18-year-old Swiss national died at a hospital in Zurich on January 31,\" the Wallis canton's public prosecutor, Beatrice Pilloud, said in a statement.No further information would be released at this stage, she added.The fire at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana - a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16 - also injured 116 people.Most of the victims of the fire were young - eight were under the age of 16 - and many are still being treated in hospital for severe burns.Switzerland's Federal Office for Civil Protection told the AFP news agency on Friday that, as of Monday, 44 patients were being treated abroad. They included 18 in France, 12 in Italy, eight in Germany and six in Belgium.The Wallis health ministry told the news agency that 37 patients were still in Swiss hospitals as of Monday.Initial findings from an investigation suggest the fire began as sparklers attached to champagne bottles ignited soundproof foam that lined the ceiling of the bar's basement.Authorities have acknowledged that the bar had not undergone safety checks for five years.The owners of the bar, Jacques and Jessica Moretti, have been accused by authorities of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.Criminal proceedings have also been brought against the municipality's head of public safety and a former council fire safety inspector.A Swiss court has imposed a travel ban on Jessica Moretti as an alternative to pre-trial detention. She has had to surrender her passport and must report to police every day.She previously told reporters that she was sorry about the \"unthinkable tragedy\".Jacques Moretti is being held in custody for an initial period of 90 days.",

    "body": "12 hours agoBarbara Plett Usher,in Doha, Qatar,andJack BurgessEPAIran is due to hold live fire naval drills in the Strait of HormuzIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that any attack on his country would spark a regional conflict, as the US continues to build up its forces nearby.\"The Americans should know that if they start a war, this time it will be a regional war,\" Khamenei was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency.Donald Trump earlier said Iran was in \"serious discussions\" and he hoped they would lead to something \"acceptable\", while Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told CNN he was \"confident that we can achieve a deal\" on Tehran's nuclear programme.Araghchi said: \"Unfortunately, we have lost our trust [in] the US as a negotiating partner,\" but added the exchange of messages through friendly countries in the region was facilitating \"fruitful\" talks with Washington.Iran's top security official Ali Larijani had previously said a framework for negotiations was progressing.As part of its build up of forces, the US has sent its aircraft carrier the USS Abraham Lincoln to the region and late last week US Central Command said it was operating in the Arabian Sea.\"[Trump] regularly says that he brought ships... The Iranian nation shall not be scared by these things,\" added Khamenei.Iran had been expected to begin a two-day live-fire naval exercise on Sunday in the Strait of Hormuz - one of the world's most important shipping lanes and a key route for energy supplies. However on Sunday Reuters quoted an Iranian official as saying the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) navy had no plans for such an exercise.Around a fifth of the world's traded oil passes through the waterway, which is about 33km (21 miles) wide at its narrowest point between Iran and Oman. Iran has in the past threatened to close the strait if it were attacked. The US has warned Iran against any \"unsafe and unprofessional behaviour\" near its forces in the area.Araghchi responded by saying: \"The US military is now attempting to dictate how our Powerful Armed Forces should conduct target practice in their own turf.\"On Saturday, two explosions in Iran heightened anxiety in the country. Local authorities said a blast that killed one and hurt 14 at a building in the southern port city of Bandar Abbas was caused by a gas leak. Tasnim denied social media reports that a Revolutionary Guards Corps navy commander had been targeted in the blast.In the south-western city of Ahvaz, at least four people were killed in another explosion, with local authorities again blaming a gas leak, according to Iran's Tehran Times.On Thursday, Trump said he had told Iran that it had to do two things to avoid US military action: \"Number one, no nuclear. And number two, stop killing protesters.\"The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says it has confirmed the killing of more than 6,300 people since the unrest began in late December, and is investigating another 17,000 reported deaths.Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned the final toll could exceed 25,000.In his remarks on Sunday, Khamenei accused protesters of attacking police, the IRGC and other facilities including banks and mosques.\"The coup was suppressed,\" Tasnim quoted him as saying.",

    "body": "4 hours agoMadeline HalpertWatch: President Trump's name added to facade of Kennedy CenterThe Kennedy Center in Washington DC will be closed for a two-year renovation beginning in July, President Donald Trump has announced.In a post on Truth Social on Sunday, Trump said the centre would close on 4 July this year \"in honor of the 250th Anniversary of our Country\". The move follows several artists cancelling performances at the storied institution after it was recently renamed as the Trump Kennedy Center.Shortly after taking office, the president fired several of the board members at the centre and replaced them with allies, who then voted to make Trump chairman of the board.The new board renamed the institution the Donald J Trump and the John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts in December. New signage appeared on the building's exterior the following day.Several musical acts, including Steven Schwartz, the composer of the musical Wicked, and a group called Doug Varone and the Dancers, cancelled performances at the centre in the following weeks because of the Trump name change. On Thursday, the venue hosted a premiere screening of a documentary about first lady Melania Trump.Trump has said there would be a \"scheduled grand reopening\" for the facility, and that the renovations had already been financed. \"I have determined that The Trump Kennedy Center, if temporarily closed for construction, revitalization, and complete rebuilding, can be, without question, the finest performing arts facility of its kind, anywhere in the world,\" he wrote on Truth Social. \"In other words, if we don't close, the quality of construction will not be nearly as good, and the time to completion, because of interruptions with Audiences from the many events using the facility, will be much longer.\"Getty ImagesScreening of the documentary film Melania at The Kennedy Center on 29 January Trump had lambasted the physical state of the centre and worked with Congress to allocate more than $250m (£182m) to rebuild it, one of many renovation projects he has taken on in his second term. Some US lawmakers and legal scholars have argued that because the centre was named in a 1964 law, Congress must have a say on any name change.Last December Democratic US Representative Joyce Beatty filed a lawsuit seeking to remove Trump's name for that reason. Some members of President John F Kennedy's family too have denounced the move. The centre was named in Kennedy's memory shortly after his assassination.Joe Kennedy III, a former US House of Representatives member and grandnephew of the late president, said the venue was \"a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editor in OsloVisionhaus/Getty ImagesCrown Princess Mette-Marit said she regretted having any contact with Epstein at allNorwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre has said he agrees with Crown Princess Mette-Marit's admission of \"poor judgement\" after it emerged she had extensive contacts with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The princess features hundreds of times between 2011-14, in the latest files released by the US Department of Justice relating to Epstein.This latest embarrassment for the royal family comes on the eve of her son's seven-week trial in Oslo on 38 charges including rape and assault.Princess Mette-Marit married Norway's Crown Prince Haakon as a commoner when her son Marius Borg Høiby was four, and is in line to become queen when her husband accedes to the throne.As the content of her email exchanges began to emerge, the princess released a statement on Saturday saying: \"I showed poor judgement and regret having any contact with Epstein at all. It is simply embarrassing.\" She went on to express her \"deep sympathy and solidarity with the victims of the abuses committed by Jeffrey Epstein\".Although the prime minister did not go further than agreeing with the princess's admission of poor judgement, his implicit criticism of her is considered unusual.  Støre said he also believed that ex-Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland had exercised \"poor judgement\", after it emerged that he had planned a family holiday on Epstein's private island, although he then cancelled it.The latest cache of Epstein files reveals that Princess Mette-Marit spent four days at Epstein's house in Palm Beach, Miami in January 2013; and in one email from the HRH Crown Princess account, Epstein is asked whether a mother should suggest naked women carrying a surfboard for her son's wallpaper.US Department of JusticeThe warm nature of the correspondence has appalled commentators in Norway, and one message implied she was aware of his initial jail term in 2008.Norway's royal family has been buffeted by a succession of scandals in recent times, including the marriage of the crown prince's sister, Princess Märtha Louise to a self-styled American shaman.Now as Norwegians prepare for the trial of Marius Borg Høiby, questions are being asked about his mother's failure to realise the toxic nature of maintaining contact with Epstein, and the role of her advisers.Mette-Marit is suffering from pulmonary fibrosis and her doctors are preparing to put her on a list for a lung transplant. Her 29-year-old son, who is not part of the royal family, denies the most serious charges against him. One charge of rape involves intercourse while a woman was asleep. Three others allege sexual assault while women were incapacitated, which also counts as rape in Norway.If found guilty he could face at least 10 years in jail.No member of the royal family will attend the trial, which starts at Oslo district court on Tuesday. However, in an emotional statement to reporters last week, Crown Prince Haakon said \"our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by this case...we understand that this is a difficult time for many of you, and we sympathise\".Although his stepson was not a member of the royal family he said: \"We care about him, and he is an important member of our family.\"",

    "body": "16 hours agoGeorge WrightAFP via Getty ImagesIsrael says it will ban Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) from working in Gaza after the medical charity refused to hand over a list of its staff in the territory.The Israeli government had ordered 37 organisations to submit documents about their local and international workers in Gaza, claiming some in MSF had links to armed groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The charity has vehemently denied this.MSF announced on Friday that it would not share a list of its Palestinian and international staff with Israeli authorities as it had not secured \"assurances to ensure the safety of our staff\".In response, Israel said it was \"moving to terminate the activities\" of MSF in Gaza.The Israeli Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism said the decision followed \"MSF's failure to submit lists of local employees, a requirement applicable to all humanitarian organisations operating in the region\".On 30 December, Israel announced that it was going to revoke the licences of 37 international non-governmental organisations working in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, saying they had failed to meet new registration requirements.At the time the diaspora ministry said the measure was needed to prevent \"the infiltration of terrorist operatives into humanitarian structures\".The groups - which include MSF, ActionAid and the Norwegian Refugee Council - were told their operations must end within 60 days.The move was condemned by 10 countries, including the UK, France and Canada, who said the rules would have a severe impact on access to essential services.MSF said in a statement on Friday that it had informed Israeli authorities that, as an \"exceptional measure\", it would share a list of names of its Palestinian and international staff, \"subject to clear parameters, with our staff safety at its core\". \"However, despite repeated efforts, it became evident in recent days that we were unable to build engagement with Israeli authorities on the concrete assurances required,\" it said.\"These included that any staff information would be used only for its stated administrative purpose and would not put colleagues at risk.\"On Sunday, it said the move was a \"pretext to obstruct humanitarian assistance\" to Gaza.\"Israeli authorities are forcing humanitarian organisations into an impossible choice between exposing staff to risk or interrupting critical medical care for people in desperate need,\" it said. Sam Rose, director of Gaza affairs for the UN's Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa, told the BBC that this will have \"major negative consequences on the ability of international organisations to provide healthcare inside Gaza\".He said MSF had its own reasons for not handing over staff lists \"given the large numbers of staff of medical organisations and international organisations that have been killed over the past two years\". A total of 1,700 healthcare staff have been killed in the war, including 15 MSF staff, the medical charity says.MSF says it currently provides at least 20% of hospital beds in Gaza and operates around 20 health centres. Last year, it carried out more than 800,000 medical consultations and more than 10,000 infant deliveries, while providing drinking water.The latest war in Gaza began after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,660 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.It says at least 509 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire began on 10 October 2025. Four Israeli soldiers have also been killed.",

    "body": "12 hours agoHenri AstierWikipedia CommonsJavier Tarazona was arrested in July 2021 - photo Juanjoseco123, Wikimedia Commons CC BY-SA 4.0Prominent Venezuelan rights activist Javier Tarazona has been freed, in the latest prisoner release announced by the government amid US pressure for reforms.Tarazona, the head of human rights NGO Fundaredes, was arrested in 2021 and detained in the notorious El Helicoide prison in the capital Caracas. His release was announced on Sunday by Fundaredes.Foro Penal, another Venezuelan rights group, said it had verified the liberation of more than 300 political prisoners since 8 January.On Friday acting President, Delcy Rodríguez said the government would introduce an amnesty law that is expected to benefit hundreds of political prisoners. Under the bill, El Helicoide is also due to be closed.In its statement on Sunday, Fundaredes said Tarazona had been jailed \"for defending human rights, denouncing abuses, and speaking out\".It added that his release did not \"erase the injustice he suffered\", but represented \"a necessary step in a process marked by criminalisation, persecution, and a lack of due process\".Tarazona had alleged that government officials had links with guerrillas in Colombia, with which Venezuela has a 2,000km (1,200-mile) border. The government accused him of treason, terrorism and incitement to hatred.Maduro's dramatic capture by US special forces on 3 January has encouraged families of opposition and human rights figures arrested under Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chávez to step up their campaign for releases.Venezuela has long denied holding political prisoners, but families and rights advocates have demanded charges against detainees be dropped. Opposition politicians, journalists, and activists have faced charges including terrorism and treason, which their families describe as arbitrary.The amnesty bill announced by Rodríguez is expected to be approved by the National Assembly in the coming days. Its aim, the acting president said, is to \"heal the wounds of political confrontation, violence, and extremism\".Foro Penal has said that many of those freed in recent weeks have not had the charges against them dropped.This has left them in legal limbo and they have been barred from speaking in public, the group added.",

    "body": "19 hours agoJaroslav LukivEPAAttackers struck cities across Balochistan including the provincial capital QuettaA series of gun and bomb attacks across Pakistan's south-western Balochistan province have killed 31 civilians and 17 security service personnel, the region's Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti says.Security forces responding to the violence killed at least 145 attackers during a 40-hour gun battle, he said. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) rebel group had earlier said it was behind the attacks, claiming dozens of soldiers were killed.It marks an escalation of violence in the impoverished but resource-rich province, where Pakistan's government has been battling an ethnic insurgency for decades.Pakistan accused India of supporting the BLA. Delhi has repeatedly denied such accusations.Grenade and gun attacks in the provincial capital Quetta and cities and towns across the province targeted hospitals, schools, banks and markets, Pakistan's junior interior minister Talal Chaudhry said.\"In each case, the attackers came in dressed as civilians and indiscriminately targeted ordinary people working in shops,\" he said, adding that the attackers had used civilians as human shields.Armed attackers also opened fire at security installations, attempted to carry out suicide bombings and briefly blocked roads in urban areas.Some key administrative buildings in Quetta and nearby roads were reported to have been sealed off during the day. Mobile phone services were jammed, and regional train services were suspended.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later praised the military, pledging to \"continue the war against terrorism until its complete eradication\".The BLA said it had launched a coordinated operation dubbed Herof, or \"black storm\" against security forces, and claimed to have killed 84 members of the security forces and kidnapped a further 18. The claim has not been independently verified and the Pakistani military has not commented.The BLA accuses Pakistan's federal government of exploiting the rich mineral resources of its largest province without the local population benefiting. Local activists also blame Pakistani security forces for enforced disappearances, which Islamabad denies.Balochistan covers nearly 44% of the country's total land, sharing a volatile border with Iran and Afghanistan and covering part of the Arabian Sea coastline. It is home to about 5% of the country's more than 240 million people. The province is also the richest in terms of natural resources, including gas and minerals. The region derives its name from the Baloch tribe, which is the largest ethnic group there. Resistance against the Pakistani government and an insurgency advocating for an independent state for the Baloch people began in 1948, after Pakistan gained independence from the British Empire.",

So what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?\" Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting and trafficking teenage girls to be sexually abused by the disgraced financier Epstein prior to his death in custody in 2019.\"I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light,\" Wasserman said in a statement.He also emphasised that he had \"never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein\".\"As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane,\" Wasserman said.\"I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.\"While the files do not show any wrongdoing on the part of those featured, including Wasserman, they have raised renewed questions for those who associated with the influential financier.Wasserman founded a sports and entertainment agency in 2002, and is a trustee of the non-profit Clinton Foundation, according to the Olympics website.Ghislaine Maxwell agreed last month to testify under oath before the congressional committee investigating the federal government's handling of the Epstein files.The committee also summoned both former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to testify.The former president appeared in photographs with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s.Bill Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein's abuse and has denied knowledge of his sex offending.Epstein, who was convicted of sexual offences in 2008, was found dead in his New York prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.",

    "body": "15 hours agoJack BurgessGetty ImagesThe US immigration enforcement agency has faced increased criticism following the deaths of two US citizensFrench technology giant Capgemini has announced it will sell its US subsidiary after its work locating people for immigration enforcement agency ICE sparked outrage.Capgemini has come under pressure from French lawmakers over a contract its subsidiary signed with ICE, amid international scrutiny over the methods used by the agency's agents in Minnesota.Capgemini Government Solutions has been under contract since 18 December to provide \"skip tracing services for enforcement and removal operations\", public records show.Skip tracing services locate individuals whose whereabouts are unknown. Capgemini Government Solutions is set to be paid more than $4.8m (£3.5m) for its work tracing people for ICE, which is due to continue until 15 March, US government listings show. It is one of 13 contracts the subsidiary holds with ICE.Capgemini, one of the largest listed companies in France, said in a statement that it had not been able \"to exercise appropriate control over certain aspects of this subsidiary's operations in order to ensure alignment with the Group's objectives\".It added that \"the divestiture process of this business will be initiated immediately\".Criticism of ICE practices has intensified in recent weeks since the shooting of 37-year-old Pretti, the second fatal shooting of a US citizen since immigration agents began surging several cities across the US, acting on the Trump administration's drive to increase deportations of illegal immigrants.The killing of Pretti involved Border Patrol, an immigration agency which works alongside ICE, while Good was shot by an ICE agent.ICE has detained thousands since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House with a pledge to increase deportations. ICE enforcement actions have regularly occurred in public places, leading to a number of clashes with protesters.Last week, Capgemini's CEO Aiman Ezzat wrote on LinkedIn that \"we were recently made aware, through public sources, of the nature of a contract awarded to Capgemini Government Solutions by DHS' Immigration and Customs Enforcement in December 2025\". \"The nature and scope of this work has raised questions compared to what we typically do as a business and technology firm,\" he said.The revelation provoked outrage amongst French politicians.French Finance Minister Roland Lescure called for the company \"to be transparent\" about the contracts it has with ICE.Meanwhile, left-wing opposition MP Hadrien Clouet called for sanctions to be imposed on French firms working with ICE, commenting: \"French private companies are collaborating with ICE. We do not accept this.\"Capgemini was founded in 1967 and currently functions as an IT services and consulting firm. It currently has more than 340,000 employees worldwide and is valued at €22bn (£19bn).",

    "body": "1 day agoMadeline HalpertColumbia Heights Public SchoolsA US judge has ordered the release of a five-year-old boy and his father from an immigration detention centre in Texas, condemning it as driven by a \"perfidious lust for unbridled power\".The detention of Liam Conejo Ramos, photographed wearing a blue bunny-shaped hat and a Spider-Man backpack, sparked national outcry after he was taken into custody on the driveway of his home in Minneapolis.The child's father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, was also detained.Following the outrage over the pre-schooler's detention, immigration officials said they did not \"target a child\" but were conducting an operation against his father, an \"illegal alien\" who \"abandoned\" his son when approached.On Saturday, US District Judge Fred Biery granted an emergency request from the family's lawyer, ordering government officials to release the father and son by 3 February. The judge also included a photo of Ramos in his fluffy blue hat in his ruling.\"The case has its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatising children,\" Biery wrote in his ruling. Biery, an appointee of former US President Bill Clinton, said deportations through the US immigration system should occur in a more orderly and humane policy than currently in place. \"Observing human behaviour confirms that for some among us, the perfidious lust for unbridled power and the imposition of cruelty in its quest know no bounds and are bereft of human decency,\" he wrote of the detention of Ramos. The BBC has contacted the Department of Homeland Security for comment. Marc Prokosch, a lawyer representing the family, said the boy and his father were being held at a detention centre in San Antonio, Texas. Prokosch said Ramos and his father had come to the US in 2024 from Ecuador to seek asylum and had been following the proper immigration protocols. In recent weeks, US President Donald Trump has ramped up immigration enforcement efforts in Minneapolis in an initiative dubbed \"Operation Metro Surge\".On Thursday, Trump officials suggested they may start pulling back federal forces in the state after a national outcry over the fatal shootings of two US citizens in Minneapolis by federal agents.In a separate ruling on Saturday, a federal judge denied a state government's request to block the Trump administration's deployment of thousands of immigration agents in Minneapolis, saying the state had not proven the activity was unlawful.

    "body": "21 hours agoAleks PhillipsGetty ImagesMiroslav Lajčák denied any wrongdoing but said he was stepping down to avoid political ramificationsThe national security adviser to Slovakia's prime minister has resigned after documents released by the US showed he exchanged messages about girls and diplomacy with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Robert Fico announced he had accepted Miroslav Lajčák's departure in a video message on Saturday, describing the adviser as \"an incredible source of experience in diplomacy and foreign policy\".The resignation comes a day after three million files relating to the influential financier were released by the US Department of Justice.While the files do not show any wrongdoing on the part of those featured, including Lajčák, they have raised renewed questions for those who associated with Epstein.In a text exchange from October 2018 - when Lajčák was serving as Slovakia's foreign minister - Lajčák and Epstein could be seen lightheartedly discussing women and a forthcoming meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.After Epstein sent an image, which cannot be seen in the record, Lajčák replies: \"Why don't you invite me for these games? I would take the 'MI' girl\".\"Who wouldn't,\" Epstein texts back. \"You can have them both, I am not possessive. And their sisters.\"Later on in the conversation, Epstein can be seen imploring Lajčák to ask Lavrov to get him a t-shirt featuring Lavrov and Viltaly Churkin, a Russian ambassador to the UN who had died the previous year.\"You get the tee shirt. Then you get the girls,\" Epstein writes, to which Lajčák agrees.Epstein then says: \"No kidding their sisters are both swimming in the pool.\"\"That's not fair!\" Lajčák responds. \"Though they're all under 30. So. Probably too young for you,\" Epstein adds. \"Or should I say under 50.\"\"Don't be mean,\" Lajčák replies. \"You don't know me in action.\"Lajčák initially denied discussing women with Epstein when the files were released on Friday, according to Slovak media. He later reportedly said he had decided to resign to avoid damaging Fico politically.Fico characterised the outrage in Slovakia over Lajčák's association with Epstein as \"an attack against me\".\"I have not seen so much hypocrisy in his criticism for a long time, and from all sides,\" he said. Lajčák had served in four Slovak governments, three led by Fico, and as an international diplomat. The former foreign affairs minister had most recently been an EU special representative for the western Balkans.Among them are images of the former Duke of York, who was stripped of his titles over his association with the disgraced financier, that appear to show the former prince kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground.",

    "body": "1 day agoGrace Eliza GoodwinGetty ImagesUS Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick planned a visit to Jeffrey Epstein's island with his family, emails show - years after Lutnick claimed to have cut ties with the convicted paedophile.The billionaire businessman, his wife, their four children and another family planned to travel to Little Saint James in 2012, according to emails included in the latest Epstein files released by the US Department of Justice (DOJ).The emails contradict statements Lutnick made in October about vowing in 2005 to \"never be in a room\" with Epstein again.A Commerce Department spokesperson said Lutnick had never been accused of any wrongdoing in connection to Epstein.On Friday, the justice department released millions of pages from Epstein files, the largest number of documents shared by the government since a law mandated their release last year.Several emails show Lutnick and his family planned a visit to Little Saint James - a private island that Epstein purchased in 1998.In one email from December 2012, Lutnick's wife Allison wrote to Epstein's assistant: \"We are looking forward to visiting you. We will be coming from Caneel Bay in the morning. We are a crowd... 2 families each with 4 kids ranging in age from 7-16! 6 boys and 2 girls. I hope that's okay. We would love to join you for lunch.\"In another email, sent to a redacted recipient days before his wife's email, Lutnick writes: \"Hi Jeff, We are landing in St. Thomas early Saturday afternoon and planning to head over to St. Bart's/Anguilla on Monday at some point... Does Sunday evening for dinner sound good?\"Lutnick then asks for specific location details for his boat captain, and mentions that another family is with his family.Other emails were exchanged in December about Howard Lutnick joining Epstein for lunch on the island. On 24 December 2012, Lutnick received an email from a redacted sender that said Epstein wanted to pass a message to him, which said: \"Nice seeing you\" - suggesting that at least one visit did happen.The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing.According to an October 2025 interview with the New York Post, Lutnick said he had cut ties with Epstein in 2005 when the pair were neighbours in New York.Lutnick explained to the newspaper that Epstein had given him and his wife a tour of his Manhattan townhouse, where the late financier showed off his massage room.\"I say to him, 'Massage table in the middle of your house? How often do you have a massage?'\" Lutnick told the Post. \"And he says, 'Every day.' And then he gets, like weirdly close to me, and he says, 'And the right kind of massage'.\"Lutnick told the outlet that, after leaving Epstein's house, \"in the six to eight steps it takes to get from his house to my house, my wife and I decided that I will never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again\".The Commerce Department said in a statement to the BBC that \"Secretary Lutnick had limited interactions with Mr Epstein in the presence of his wife and has never been accused of wrongdoing\".Three million pages, 180,000 images and 2,000 videos were posted publicly by the DOJ on Friday.Epstein was convicted in 2008 in Florida for soliciting sex from a 14-year-old girl after coming to a controversial plea agreement with prosecutors.He died in August 2019 while in jail on charges in a sex trafficking case.",

    "body": "2 days agoMaia DaviesReutersElon Musk - the boss of SpaceX as well as Tesla and X - is the world's richest personElon Musk's SpaceX has applied to launch one million satellites into Earth's orbit to power artificial intelligence (AI).The application claims \"orbital data centres\" are the most cost and energy-efficient way to meet the growing demand for AI computing power.Traditionally, such centres are large warehouses full of powerful computers that process and store data. Musk's aerospace firm claims processing needs due to the expanding use of AI are already outpacing \"terrestrial capabilities\".It would increase the number of SpaceX satellites in orbit drastically. Its existing Starlink network of nearly 10,000 satellites has already been accused of creating congestion in space, which Musk denies.The new network could comprise up to one million solar-powered satellites, according to the application filed on Friday with the US Federal Communications Commission - which does not specify a timeline for the plan.SpaceX claims the system would deliver the computer capacity required to serve \"billions of users globally\".It also says it would be the first step towards \"becoming a Kardashev II-level civilisation - one that can harness the Sun's full power\", referencing a scale of hypothetical alien societies proposed by an astronomer in the 1960s.Musk wrote on his social media site X: \"The satellites will actually be so far apart that it will be hard to see from one to another. Space is so vast as to be beyond comprehension.\"Like the Starlink satellites, which provide high-speed internet, they would operate in low-Earth orbit at altitudes ranging between 500-2,000km (310-1,242 miles).SpaceX claims \"orbital data centres\" - a concept also being explored by other firms - would be a greener alternative to traditional centres, which require enormous amounts of power to run and water for cooling.An expert previously told the BBC that launching hardware into orbit remains expensive and that the infrastructure to protect, cool and power them can be complex - while a growing quantity of space debris puts the physical hardware at risk.Meanwhile, astronomers complained in 2024 that radio waves from the Starlink network were \"blinding\" their telescopes and hindering their research.Musk has previously rejected claims that his satellites were taking up too much room and crowding out competitors.",

    "body": "24 hours agoMaia DaviesBBCOfficials say a gas leak was the blame for the explosion in Bandar AbbasFive people have been killed in two separate explosions in Iran which local officials and state media say were caused by gas leaks.One person was killed and 14 injured in a blast at a residential building in the southern city of Bandar Abbas on the Gulf coast, a local official told Iran's semi-official Mehr news agency.Another explosion killed four people in the south-western city of Ahvaz, the state-run Tehran Times reported.It comes as tensions persist in the region after a build-up of US forces in the Gulf and pressure on Tehran from US President Donald Trump to strike a deal on its nuclear programme.Trump was asked by journalists whether he had decided what to do in Iran while travelling to Florida on Saturday night and said: \"I certainly can't tell you that.\" But he added, reiterating comments made to Fox News earlier in the day, that Iran was talking \"seriously\" to Washington.He said he hoped they would negotiate something acceptable, and noted that the US had \"very big powerful ships\" in the region.Earlier, in the port city of Bandar Abbas, state TV said an explosion had ripped though an eight-storey building, \"destroying two floors, several vehicles, and shops\" in the Moallem Boulevard area.The local fire department chief Mohammad Amin Liaqat said a preliminary assessment showed it had been caused by a gas leak and \"build-up\".\"My colleagues will give more details in the next few hours,\" he said in a video published by Mehr.Mehrdad Hassanzadeh, a regional official, told the news agency that the injured had been taken to hospital.Semi-official news agency Tasnim denied social media reports that a Revolutionary Guards Corps navy commander had been targeted in the blast.Elsewhere, the Tehran Times reported a second explosion at a residential building in the Kianshahr neighbourhood of Ahvaz, near the border with Iraq.It reported that emergency officials had rescued a child trapped beneath debris and transferred him for medical treatment.Trump told Fox News on Saturday that Iran was \"negotiating\", adding that Washington could not share its plans with its allies in the Gulf.\"We'll see if we can do something, otherwise we'll see what happens... we have a big fleet heading out there.\"Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian said conflict would not be in the interest of either country, nor the broader region.\"The Islamic Republic of Iran has never sought and in no way seeks war,\" he said during a call with his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, news agency AFP reported, citing a statement from Iran's presidency.Separately, the head of the country's Supreme National Security Council Ali Larijani met the Qatari prime minister in Tehran on Saturday and \"reviewed ongoing efforts to de-escalate tensions in the region\", Qatar's foreign ministry said.Larijani, whom the Kremlin said had also met Russia's President Vladimir Putin for talks on Friday, wrote on X: \"Contrary to the hype of the contrived media war, structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing.\" Iran's foreign minister has said Tehran was open to talks with the US provided they were based on trust and respect, but cautioned that its missile defence system would \"never\" be the subject of negotiation.Trump told Tehran on Wednesday that time was \"running out\" for it to reach a deal on its nuclear programme - which Iran insists is peaceful - and later said they must also \"stop killing protesters\" to avoid military action.It came after he promised to intervene to help protesters who had been subject to a brutal crackdown in the country earlier this month, though he later said he had heard on good authority that the execution of demonstrators had stopped.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says it has confirmed the killing of more than 6,300 people since the unrest began in late December, and was investigating another 17,000 reported deaths.",

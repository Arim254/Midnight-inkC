    "body": "1 day agoDanai Nesta KupembaBBC NewsAn Australian man who jumped over a barricade and grabbed Hollywood star Ariana Grande has been deported and banned from Singapore.Johnson Wen, 26, was sentenced to nine days in prison for being a public nuisance and has now been \"barred from re-entering Singapore\", the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) told local media. Wen pushed past photographers and charged at the actress and singer, who was attending the Asian premier for Wicked: For Good on 13 November. Co-star Cynthia Erivo wrestled him away from Grande. Wen has a history of disrupting concerts and celebrity events, including jumping on stage at Katy Perry's Sydney concert in June this year.The incident sparked outrage in Singapore, with many accusing him of re-traumatising Grande. The pop star has spoken of experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder after a suicide bomb attack at her concert in Manchester in May 2017 killed 22 people and injured hundreds.During Wen's trial, the court heard he had attempted to intrude on the film's premiere twice, according to Singaporean media.He then made a second attempt to jump the barricades. Security staff stopped him and pinned him down.Wen later posted videos thanking Grande for letting him on the carpet and said he was \"free\". Police arrested him the next day and charged him with public nuisance, to which Wen pleaded guilty. The District Judge Christopher Goh was quoted by Channel News Asia as saying that Wen was \"attention seeking\", adding that he was wrong to think he would not suffer any consequences. Grande has not commented on the case. Erivo spoke about the incident to NBC, saying that she \"just wanted to make sure my friend was safe\".\"I'm sure he didn't mean us harm, but you never know with those things, and I wanted to make sure that she was OK. That was my first instinct,\" she said. ",

    "body": "54 minutes agoCaroline Davies,Pakistan correspondent, Islamabad, Azizullah Khan,BBC Urdu, Peshawar and Kelly NgTwo suicide bombers have attacked the headquarters of a Pakistani paramilitary force on Monday, killing three security officials and wounding at least 12 people.Police told BBC Urdu that the attackers were armed as they charged at the Federal Constabulary's headquarters in Peshawar in north-western Pakistan.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.The constabulary's complex is located in a highly secured area in Peshawar, and the attackers would have had to breach multiple levels of security to break in.Witnesses told local media they heard two loud explosions at around 08:10 local time (03:10 GMT) on Monday. The area has been cordoned off and rescue teams are currently on site. One official said five security officials and seven civilians were injured.Pakistan authorities have described the attack as a \"foiled terrorist plot\", noting that the attackers were gunned down at the gate, before they managed to enter the building.\"The perpetrators of this incident should be identified as soon as possible and brought to justice,\" said Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Pakistan's Federal Constabulary, previously known as the Frontier Constabulary, is responsible for handling situations beyond the capabilities of the police force, including tribal incursions and criminal gang violence.Peshawar is part of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which sits along the border Afghanistan and has long been a flashpoint for militant violence.The Pakistani Taliban, also known as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), is active in the province and had claimed responsibility for similar attacks across the country.Two weeks ago, a suicide attack outside a court in Pakistan's capital Islamabad killed 12 people and injured at least 27 others. Pakistan blamed India and Afghanistan, without proof. Both countries rejected these accusations.The TTP eventually claimed responsibility for the attack.In February this year, six people were killed in a suicide attack at an Islamic seminary in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The attack came ahead of the start of the holy month of Ramadan.No group has yet claimed responsibility for that attack.",

    "body": "Pioneering Australian chef Skye Gyngell has died aged 62.Gyngell rose to fame in the UK after her cafe at Petersham Nurseries in south-west London was awarded a coveted Michelin star, one of the highest culinary honours. She went on to helm Spring restaurant at Somerset House and Marle and Hearth at Heckfield Place in Hampshire.Gyngell's family said she died on Saturday in London, describing her as a \"culinary visionary who influenced generations of chefs and growers globally to think about food and its connection to the land\". Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver paid tribute to Gyngell - who was diagnosed with skin cancer last year - and thanked her for \"all you did to inspire young cooks\".During the 1980s, Gyngell pioneered the \"slow food movement\" before becoming a private chef for clients including Nigella Lawson, Madonna and Guy Ritchie.Lawson mourned her death, writing on Instagram, \"However ill you know someone to be, their death is always a shock. It's just awful that Skye is no longer in the world.\"Gyngell died just days after her mother, Ann Barr, who was a well-known interior designer.Her father, Bruce Gyngell, was the first person to appear on Australian television in 1956 with the line: \"Good evening, and welcome to television\". He died in 2000.Born in Sydney, Skye Gyngell was studying at Sydney University when she realised the culinary world was where she wanted to be. She moved to Paris at 19, where she trained and worked under acclaimed chefs including at the two Michelin-starred restaurant Dodin-Bouffant.Gyngell later moved to London and worked at the French House in Soho with Fergus and Margot Henderson.In 2004, Gyngell became head chef at Petersham Nurseries cafe in Richmond, where she  turned the dilapidated site into a thriving cafe, and in 2011, it was awarded a Michelin star.But the kudos was a double-edged sword for Gyngell, who left the cafe a year after the award, saying she was frustrated by customers who expected a traditional Michelin experience at her rustic cafe.Her later ventures included Spring at Somerset House, which was the first single-use plastic-free restaurant in London. Gyngell, who overcame drug and alcohol addiction in her younger years, was also known for her award-winning cookbooks and wrote columns for Vogue as its food editor.Last year, she found a lump in her neck and was diagnosed with Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare and aggressive skin cancer.She underwent an operation which included the removal of her salivary glands, causing her to temporarily lose her sense of smell and taste.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "At least 90 people have died and another 12 are missing after days of heavy rain in Vietnam led to flooding and landslides.The Vietnamese government says 186,000 homes have been damaged across the country, with more than three million livestock swept away. Officials estimate there has been hundreds of millions of pounds worth of damage.The mountainous province of Dak Lak has been severely impacted, recording more than 60 deaths since 16 November, according to news agency AFP.The floods are the latest extreme weather event to hit Vietnam in recent months, after typhoons Kalmaegi and Bualoi hit the country within weeks of each other.Some 258,000 people were without power on Sunday morning and sections of major motorways and train tracks were blocked, officials said.Military and police resources have been mobilised to assist in the hardest hit areas.The government said the most severe impacts had been observed in five provinces - Quang Ngai, Gia Lai, Dak Lak, Khanh Hoa, and Lam Dong - clustered in south and south-central Vietnam.Mach Van Si, a farmer in Dak Lak, told AFP: \"Our neighbourhood was completely destroyed. Nothing was left. Everything was covered in mud.\"Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính chaired a virtual emergency meeting on Sunday morning from South Africa, where he had been attending the G20 summit. Rainfall had exceeded 1.5m (5ft) in several areas leading up to Friday, with some areas surpassing a 5.2m level not seen since 1993. The rain is forecast to ease in the coming days.Scientists say that Vietnam has been left more exposed to extreme weather events by human-driven climate change, which has made typhoons stronger and more frequent.",

    "body": "2 days agoAleks PhillipsAFP via Getty ImagesAir traffic above the southern Dutch city of Eindhoven was suspended for several hours on Saturday after unidentified drones were spotted near the airport.Drones were first observed late on Friday over the nearby Volkel air force base. Weapons were deployed to try to shoot them down but the devices got away.After more sightings on Saturday, airspace around the airport was closed  until around 23:00 local time (22:00 GMT). Dutch Defence Minister Ruben Brekelmans said authorities had \"taken measures\" without elaborating. It is the latest in a series of incidents at military installations and airports in northern Europe in recent months. Russia has denied accusations it was involved in them.As well as being used by the Royal Netherlands Air Force, Volkel Air Base hosts a US Air Force squadron as part of Nato.Officials said that for security reasons they would provide no details about how the drones were first spotted on Friday or what action was taken to try to bring them down.Drones have been sighted at other Dutch air bases in the past few weeks, as well as facilities in neighbouring Belgium, Denmark and Germany.A lack of evidence pointing to their origins has plagued investigations into the incidents since they began in September, as in many cases the drones depart after a while.Some European officials have attributed the sightings to \"hybrid warfare\" on the part of Russia, as the nations that have been targeted are all allied to Ukraine.But the Kremlin has denied it has anything to do with past incursions. Defence ministers from 10 EU countries have agreed to create a \"drone wall\" in response to the sightings, while some individual nations have sought to secure anti-drone defence measures.",

The thieves pretended to be officers of the Reserve Bank of India. They stopped the transport vehicle saying they had to check the paperwork for such a large amount of money.The vehicle's cash custodian and two security guards were instructed to get into an SUV, while one of the gang members took control of the van, police said.Police said the gang had changed vehicles, used fake registration plates and selected locations with minimal CCTV coverage to transfer the boxes of cash.A massive hunt was launched on Wednesday, with more than 200 police officers deployed across Karnataka state and the neighbouring Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Goa states.Detectives are investigating the role of CMS and possible violations of guidelines for transferring cash, Singh said.\"The vans should not follow the same route and timing repeatedly so as to become predictable,'' he added.",

    "body": "17 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent, BeirutIsrael's military has killed a senior member of the militant group Hezbollah in an air strike on the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital, Beirut, despite a ceasefire.It described Haitham Ali al-Tabtabai, Hezbollah's chief of staff, as a veteran of the group who had held a series of senior positions.Lebanon's health ministry said at least five people were killed and 28 others wounded in the strike, which hit an apartment building in the densely populated Dahieh district.Hezbollah confirmed Tabtabai's death, adding Israel had crossed a \"red line\" in carrying out the strike.The strike is Israel's first on southern Beirut for months.It comes as Israel has escalated its campaign on people and targets it says are linked to Hezbollah - a Shia Muslim group supported by Iran - despite a ceasefire brokered by the US and France that came into effect last November.Israeli officials say Hezbollah has been trying to rebuild its military capabilities, is smuggling weapons into Lebanon and stepping up the production of explosive drones as an alternative to rockets and missiles, and there are growing fears of an escalation of hostilities.In a statement after the strike, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: \"Under my leadership, the State of Israel will not allow Hezbollah to rebuild its power, and we will not allow it to once again pose a threat to the State of Israel.\"He said he expected the Lebanese government \"to fulfill its commitment to disarm Hezbollah\".Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun has urged the international community to put pressure on Israel - which continues to occupy at least five locations in southern Lebanon - to stop the attacks and withdraw from the country, saying the Israeli actions are a violation of the agreement that put an end to 13 months of conflict.The Lebanese government has vowed to disarm Hezbollah, but the group has rejected calls to discuss the future of its weapons before Israel stops its attacks, fully withdraws from Lebanon, and releases Lebanese prisoners. A Western diplomatic official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the BBC the authorities are under pressure from the Trump administration, which is growing impatient with what they see as the slow progress against the group, considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the US and UK.The latest conflict between Israel and Hezbollah erupted after the Lebanese group started firing rockets at Israeli positions the day after the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023. Hezbollah said it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.Lebanese authorities said Israel's attacks killed about 4,000 people there - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israeli authorities said more than 80 of its soldiers and 47 of its civilians were killed in the hostilities.The US government imposed sanctions on Tabtabai in 2016 and designated him a terrorist. It has a $5m (£3.8m) award on offer for information about him.The US described him as a key Hezbollah military leader who once commanded the group's special forces in Syria and Yemen, adding his actions in these countries were part of a larger Hezbollah effort to provide training, material, and personnel \"in support of its destabilising regional activities\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoGavin ButlerNews1 / Seoul Metropolitan PolicePolice released a mugshot of Kim Nok-wan to Korean mediaThe leader of a Telegram sex crime ring which facilitated the exchange of thousands of sexual abuse materials has been sentenced to life imprisonment in South Korea.Kim Nok-wan, 33, was the head of the so-called Vigilantes: a large-scale, pyramid-style group that blackmailed victims into producing explicit content and sharing it in online chatrooms.Between May 2020 and January 2025, the Vigilantes exploited at least 261 individuals – the largest number of cybersex exploitation victims in South Korea's history.Under the self-designated title of \"pastor\", Kim was found to have carried out systematic crimes including the sexual assault of minors and the distribution of images that show child sex abuse.He was sentenced on Monday after being convicted for organising and operating a criminal organisation, producing and distributing sexually exploitative and illegally filmed material, forcing the use of illegally filmed material, and \"quasi-rape\" or sexual assault where the victim was unable to resist.\"[Kim Nok-wan] says in court that he is remorseful, but he committed countless crimes over the past four to five years,\" the court said.\"Considering the brutality of the crimes and the lack of restitution for victims, it is necessary to permanently isolate him from society.\"Kim sought out both male and female targets through social networking platforms, luring them to the instant-messaging service Telegram before blackmailing them, according to police.He approached men who expressed interest in creating or distributing deepfake images, and women who expressed sexual curiosity, then threatened to disclose their personal information or report them to authorities.Some of these victims would subsequently be recruited into the Vigilantes pyramid scheme – allocated titles such as \"evangelist\" and \"deacon\" - so that they could bring in further victims.Kim ordered both adult and child victims to submit \"hourly daily reports\" and write letters of remorse, punishing those who failed to do so by forcing them to take nude photographs or harm themselves.The quantity of sexually exploitative materials produced by the Vigilantes exceeded 2,000 pieces of media.As its ringleader, Kim also raped ten under-aged women, forced women to have sexual intercourse with other men and filmed himself committing brutal acts that caused injury, police added.He was found to have participated in at least 453 Telegram channels and chat rooms for the purpose of committing his crimes - 60 of which he operated personally.The case marks the first time Telegram has cooperated with South Korean police, providing crime-related data that facilitated further investigations and led to Kim's arrest.The Korean National Police Agency established a formal system of investigative cooperation with Telegram in October 2024, enabling the platform to officially provide authorities with relevant information.",

    "body": "The granddaughter of former US President John F Kennedy has announced her diagnosis with an aggressive form of cancer.Tatiana Schlossberg said she has been given less than a year to live.The 35-year-old shared the news in an essay published in The New Yorker on Saturday - the 62nd anniversary of her grandfather's assassination.The mother-of-two climate journalist has been an outspoken opponent of her relative Robert F Kennedy Jr's position as US health secretary under President Donald Trump. In her essay, Schlossberg describes her alarm at watching her cousin be approved to the post as she was battling her illness. Schlossberg is the daughter of designer Edwin Schlossberg and diplomat Caroline Kennedy. She is the granddaughter of John F. Kennedy, the 35th president of the United States, and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. According to Schlossberg's essay titled A Battle With My Blood, she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia after giving birth in May 2024.She described her previously healthy lifestyle, which included running, skiing and even once swimming in New York's Hudson River, \"eerily, to raise money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society\".Despite treatment, including a bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy, she said doctors have told her the outcome does not look good. \"During the latest clinical trial, my doctor told me that he could keep me alive for a year, maybe,\" she writes. \"My first thought was that my kids, whose faces live permanently on the inside of my eyelids, wouldn't remember me.\" Schlossberg's son was born in 2022 and her daughter in 2024.Schlossberg, whose uncle John F Kennedy Jr died in a plane crash at age 38 and whose grandmother Jacqueline died of cancer when Schlossberg was a toddler, also describes the pain she fears her death will cause her mother, who previously served as US ambassador to Australia and Japan. \"For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry,\" she writes. \"Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.\" She also described her upset at watching her cousin, known as RFK Jr - whose father Robert F Kennedy was also assassinated while running for president - become Trump's health secretary.\"I watched from my hospital bed as Bobby, in the face of logic and common sense, was confirmed for the position, despite never having worked in medicine, public health, or the government,\" she writes. \"Suddenly, the healthcare system on which I relied felt strained, shaky.\"Earlier this month, her brother Jack Schlossberg announced that he is planning to run for Congress in New York. He shared her essay online on Saturday, with the caption: \"Life is short - let it rip.\"The Kennedy family's generations-spanning participation in US politics - along with the personal tragedy which has often touched its members - has garnered it a prominent reputation in American life.",

    "body": "2 days agoRushdi Abualouf,Gaza correspondent, Istanbul and Jon Donnison,correspondent, JerusalemAt least 22 Palestinians have been killed in a series of Israeli air strikes across northern and central Gaza, Hamas medical and civil defence officials have said.They said five sites had been hit, including residential homes. A senior Hamas commander was among the dead, according to local sources.The Israeli military said it had struck targets in Gaza in response to an incident earlier on Saturday, when it said an \"armed terrorist\" had fired at soldiers after crossing the Strip's so-called \"yellow line\" designating areas under full Israeli control. Hamas denied this.Both sides have accused each other of violating the ceasefire deal agreed on six weeks ago.More than 310 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since the ceasefire came into force, according to Gaza's health ministry.The territory's civil defence said Saturday's strikes by Israel targeted Gaza City in the north, as well as Deir al-Balah and Nuseirat camp in central Gaza.The Hamas officials said five people had been killed at the Abbas junction in the densely populated Rimal area of Gaza City. Witnesses said an Israeli strike set a car on fire.In addition, three people were killed near a mosque in Deir al-Balah, the officials said.Two houses were targeted in Israeli strikes in Nuseirat, they added, with three killed after the home of the Abu Amouneh family was hit. Seven others were killed in another strike targeting the house of the Abu Shawish family.Three more people were killed later on Saturday when a house in western Gaza City was hit, officials reported.The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a later statement: \"Today, Hamas violated the ceasefire again, sending a terrorist into Israel held territory to attack IDF soldiers. In response, Israel eliminated five senior Hamas terrorists.\"The statement also called on mediators to \"insist that Hamas fulfil its side of the ceasefire\".Following the strikes, Hamas said the army's westward push of the yellow line and continued bombardment of eastern Gaza amounted to a \"blatant breach\" of the agreement.The group called on mediators and the US to intervene urgently, warning that Israel was attempting to impose \"new facts on the ground\" and undermine the ceasefire.The Israeli military launched an offensive in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 69,500 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, including 280 during the ceasefire, according to the territory's health ministry.",

    "body": "3 hours agoNomsa MasekoBBC Africa, JohannesburgOne of the daughters of Jacob Zuma, South Africa's former president, has filed a criminal complaint against her sister, accusing her of recruiting men from South Africa to fight in the Russia-Ukraine war.Nkosazana Zuma-Mncube alleged that Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, who serves as an MP, and two others tricked 17 men into fighting for Russian mercenaries.The men were told they were travelling to Russia to train as bodyguards for Jacob Zuma's political party Mkhonto Wesizwe (MK), Zuma-Mncube's statement says.The police say they are investigating the matter, while Zuma-Sambudla, aged 43, has not responded to the BBC's request for comment.South Africa's government previously said it had received distress calls from 17 citizens who had joined mercenary forces in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.The men, aged from 20 to 39, were lured to join the mercenary forces under the pretext of lucrative contracts, the government said.South Africa has an unemployment rate of more than 30%. Joblessness among young people is even higher, making them especially vulnerable for recruitment, analysts say.Zuma-Mncube said she had a \"moral obligation\" to file a police complaint against her younger sister.Earlier this week, international financial outlet Bloomberg reported similar allegations against Zuma-Sambudla and said some men had also been recruited from neighbouring Botswana.The allegations add to Zuma-Sambudla's legal woes - she is currently on trial over terrorism-related charges.The MP is being prosecuted over comments she made on social media four years ago during deadly protests in South Africa, following the arrest of her father.A week of anarchy in several parts of the country in July 2021, including looting and arson, left at least 300 people dead.Zuma-Sambudla has been accused of fuelling this unrest but she says the charges against her are politically motivated.Jacob Zuma was jailed for contempt of court for refusing to take part in an inquiry into allegations of corruption during his presidency that led to his sacking.He subsequently formed the MK party and led it to third place in last year's elections.",

    "body": "2 hours agoGeeta PandeyDelhiDinodiaDharmendra often said he was 'embarrassed' by talk about his looksBollywood star Dharmendra has died in the Indian city of Mumbai at the age of 89.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to the actor, saying his passing \"marks the end of an era in Indian cinema\".Dharmendra, who often described himself as \"a simple man\", commanded extraordinary affection and loyalty from his tens of millions of fans.Best known as Veeru, the lovable petty criminal in the 1975 blockbuster Sholay, he appeared in over 300 films, many hits, captivating audiences for decades.Songs featuring him topped the charts, and his romance and marriage with Hema Malini made headlines.Dubbed the \"original He-Man of Bollywood\" and \"Garam (hot) Dharam\", the actor often made it to global lists of \"most handsome men\" in his heyday and female fans were known to sleep with his photographs under their pillows.Bollywood stars weren't immune to his charms either - over the years actress Madhuri Dixit described him as \"one of the most handsome people I have seen on screen\", superstar Salman Khan said Dharmendra was the \"most beautiful looking man\" and actress Jaya Bachchan called him \"a Greek God\".Dharmendra always said he was \"embarrassed\" by talk of his good looks and attributed it to \"nature, my parents and my genes\".Born on 8 December 1935 in Nasrali village in Punjab's Ludhiana district in a middle-class Jatt-Sikh family, he was named Dharam Singh Deol by his schoolteacher father.In a 2018 interview with BBC Hindi, he said his father wanted him to study, but he fell in love with films early on and wanted to be a hero.\"I watched my first film when I was in the ninth standard and I was hooked. I was wondering, where is this heaven where all these beautiful people live? I thought I must find my way there. I felt like they were mine and I belonged to them.\"But when he told his family, they were appalled.DinodiaDharmendra (right) with Amjad Khan in Sholay\"My mother said, 'you are our eldest child, you have family responsibilities'. I was very sad. So when we heard about the All India Talent Contest by Filmfare magazine, to humour me, she said, 'ok, send in your application'. We didn't think I would be selected.\"But then he won the contest and moved to Bombay (now Mumbai) and the rest, as they say, is history.For three decades - after debuting with Dil Bhi Tera, Hum Bhi Tere (The heart is yours and so am I) in 1960 - he ruled Bollywood, delivering several hits a year.Dharmendra first rose to fame with Bimal Roy's 1963 film Bandini, earning praise for his elegant portrayal of a prison doctor who falls for a convict.He soon became a romantic hero, pairing successfully with top actresses like Nutan, Meena Kumari, Mala Sinha, and Saira Banu.In 1966, he did his first action role in Phool Aur Patthar (Flower and rock), but it was the 1971 hit Mera Gaon Mera Desh (My village, my country) which cemented his reputation as an action hero.Tall and well-built, Dharmendra often did his own action scenes, involving daring stunts, even taking risks.Besides romance and action, the actor also delivered thrillers and comedies that were hits. Critics praised him \"for his impeccable comic timing\" in the hilarious 1975 film Chupke Chupke.DinodiaDharmendra with wife Bollywood actor Hema MaliniOver the years, Dharmendra said he was cast against 70 heroines, but his most successful screen pairing was with Hema Malini, who later became his second wife.The couple first met at a film premiere in 1965 and Hema Malini made an immediate impression on Dharmendra. In her 2017 biography, she wrote that she heard Dharmendra telling fellow actor Shashi Kapoor in Punjabi, \"Kudi badi changi hai (The girl is quite pretty)\".Their romance bloomed in the 1970s through superhit films like Seeta Aur Geeta, Raja Jani, and Sholay, making headlines as Dharmendra was already married with grown-up children with his first wife, Prakash Kaur.The media wrote about the resistance from Hema Malini's family to their wedding, but the couple finally tied the knot in 1980. Some reports said they had converted to Islam, which allows polygamy, to marry - a claim Dharmendra later denied.The actor-producer also dabbled in politics. He was the BJP MP from Bikaner in Rajasthan for one term from 2005 to 2009. But he was criticised for not taking politics seriously as he rarely attended parliament, preferring to spend time shooting for films or working on his farm.Speaking to a television programme, Aap Ki Adalat, years later, he agreed that he was a misfit in politics. \"Politics is not for emotional people, it's for the thick-skinned,\" he said. \"These five years were very tough for me, they were difficult.\"He worked almost to the end of his life, acting alongside his sons Sunny and Bobby Deol, judging reality shows, and connecting with fans via social media.AFP via Getty ImagesDharmendra with sons Sunny (right) and Bobby Deol (left) at his Mumbai residenceIn his lifetime, the actor gave many fine performances, but if there's one role that he'll always be remembered for, it'll be that of Veeru in Sholay - the 1975 blockbuster that has become a cultural phenomenon.The multi-starrer that also had Amitabh Bachchan, Hema Malini and Jaya Bachchan in the lead roles saw Dharmendra and Bachchan play loveable rogues-turned-saviours who are recruited to fight a dreaded bandit.The film became a cult classic and many fans credited Dharmendra for its success, describing him as the \"soul of Sholay\". The actor also described it as his finest role. \"I don't think I have ever done a better role than Veeru's,\" he said.The young girl who became Bollywood's pen-palBut despite delivering dozens of hits, Dharmendra never made it to the \"number one\" slot in Bollywood - losing to contemporaries such as Dilip Kumar, Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan - and was passed for the prestigious Filmfare awards several times.It was finally in 1997 that Filmfare honoured him with the Lifetime Achievement Award for his contribution to Hindi cinema and in 2012, he was conferred the Padma Bhushan - an Indian government honour given to civilians for distinguished service.But Dharmendra wore his stardom lightly, staying away from the rat race and said he never wanted to be number one in the industry.\"I never asked for too much money, and fame is transient. All I ever wanted was people's love,\" he told an interviewer.\"I came here just for this love. Everyone loves Dharmendra and I am grateful for that,\" he added.On Wednesday, news of his death prompted tributes from the film fraternity on social media.\"Growing up, Dharmendra was the hero every boy wanted to be,\" said actor Akshay Kumar. \"Thank you for inspiring generations. You'll live on through your films and the love you spread.\"Describing his passing as the \"end of an era\", director Karan Johar said it had left \"a gaping hole in the industry... a space that can never be filled by anyone... there will always be one and only Dharmendra\".",

    "body": "A Ukrainian refugee has become the first person from his country to win an elite-level sumo tournament.Danylo Yavhusishyn - known by his sumo ring name Aonishiki - arrived in Japan as an 18-year-old in 2022 after the Russian invasion of his country.Now aged 21, he is the first Ukrainian to claim the prized Emperor's Cup and the first European in almost eight years to do so.He is now on the verge of being promoted to the second-highest rank of Ozeki, in what would be the fastest promotion in history.Aonishiki finished the 15-day tournament in Fukuoka, Japan, with a record of 12 wins and three losses and went on to win the championship play-off against Yokozuna grand champion Hoshoryu, a 26-year-old Mongolian who won last month's London tournament.In his winning ceremony interview, Aonishiki was asked if he felt satisfied with his results after three years in sumo.\"No, I think this is just the beginning,\" he replied.The name Aonishiki contains the Japanese character for \"blue\" - a reference to the Ukrainian flag.Aonishiki is only the second Ukrainian in the top division in sumo. He first tried sumo aged seven, after also practising judo and freestyle wrestling.He impressed in youth amateur sumo competitions, and fled to Germany with his family after Russia's invasion.He moved to Japan by himself in April 2022, without knowing the language, with the help of a university sumo club captain he met previously at a youth championship event.Despite only being in professional sumo for a short time, he has gained fans in Japan and worldwide with his impressive skills, constant improvement and competitiveness.He often defeats opponents with seldom-used techniques, receiving praise from both professionals and sumo enthusiasts.Aonishiki, who was one of the most cheered wrestlers at last month's Grand Sumo Tournament at the Royal Albert Hall in London, is tipped by many to become the first-ever European to reach sumo's highest rank of Yokozuna grand champion.",

Police say she was murdered.Two people were seen leaving the building where she was found, including a woman Aishat had befriended not long before her death. Both reportedly left for Russia soon afterwards.Russians do not need a passport to enter Armenia; their internal ID is enough. That also makes it an easy route for anyone trying to flee.Chechnya, in Russia's North Caucasus, is often described by rights groups as a state within a state - a place where power is highly personalised and loyalty to long-standing leader Ramzan Kadyrov often over-rides laws and formal institutions.For years, human rights organisations have documented enforced disappearances, torture and extrajudicial killings in the republic, as well as systematic persecution of those who dissent.Chechen officials have consistently denied these allegations, complaining of fabrications aimed at discrediting the region.Aishat Baimuradova/InstagramHer friends say Aishat was a very open person seeking connection with peopleSeveral high-profile critics of Chechen authorities have been killed abroad.In 2009, Umar Israilov, a former bodyguard of Ramzan Kadyrov, was shot dead in Vienna, where he had sought asylum. Austrian authorities called the assassination politically motivated and linked the killers to Chechnya.Former Chechen rebel Zelimkhan Khangoshvili was shot dead in a Berlin park in 2019, in an attack blamed on Russian security services.But Aishat Baimuradova is the first known Chechen woman to have died in suspicious circumstances, not long after fleeing Russia.Like many other women who escape the region, she had complained of being controlled by her family. She said she was forced into a marriage, monitored, and barred from leaving home or using her phone. The BBC was not able to reach her family for a comment.Aishat arrived in Armenia with the help of SK-SOS, a crisis group that helps people facing danger in the North Caucasus. She had complained openly of conservative gender rules and the suffocating control women face in Chechnya.At first, she worked in a small town, then moved to the capital, Yerevan, hoping for a better job and more opportunities.To many who flee, such visibility is unthinkable. Most use false names, avoid showing their faces, and refuse to meet new people. Aishat chose a different path. \"She really wanted a normal life,\" her friend who asked to remain anonymous told the BBC. \"And she wanted to trust people.\"ReutersRamzan Kadyrov has ruled Chechnya since 2007. Critics accuse him of turning the Russian republic into a state within a stateHer family tried to persuade her to come back, but when nothing came of it they disowned her, according to SK SOS.\"They said to her: 'You are no longer our daughter or our wife. We won't touch you - just don't touch us,\" Alexandra Miroshnikova, spokesperson for SK SOS, told the BBC.Her uncle told local media the family had no involvement in her death.On the night of her death, Aishat was with a woman she had recently met online, who claimed to come from Dagestan, another Russian republic in the North Caucasus.People who knew Aishat told the BBC it was the woman who had first made contact with her on social media, later coming to Armenia and inviting her to parties.A man captured with her on CCTV as they left the building where Aishat's body was found was reported by a popular Russian Telegram channel to be of Chechen origin. Investigative outlet Agentstvo identified him as a relative of a businessman close to Ramzan Kadyrov.Chechen authorities deny any connection to Baimuradova's death, condemning such suggestions as a \"terrorist information attack\". Officials have also criticised groups assisting women who flee, accusing them of \"destroying family traditions\".VALERY HACHE/AFP via Getty ImagesChechen women who have sought refuge in Europe often avoid communicating with the diasporaArmenian authorities say they are investigating two unnamed people in connection with Aishat Baimuradova's murder, but they have released no further details about them.Ramzan Kadyrov is sensitive to people criticising Chechnya from abroad, says Michael Dennis, an expert on Chechen politics at the University of Texas.\"The very existence of a diaspora is a clear signal to the entire world that something is wrong in Chechnya. It's a matter of personal pride and political image,\" Mr Dennis told the BBC.Since the early 2000s, asylum seekers from Chechnya have been coming to Europe - fleeing first the war and later Kadyrov's repressive rule.But changes to EU migration policy, followed by visa restrictions for Russians because of the war in Ukraine, have all but closed that route.That leaves the South Caucasus, where Russians can travel visa-free, as the easiest escape route, but far from the safest.In July, another escapee, 24-year-old Laura Avtorkhanova, was found in a shelter in Georgia by a group of male relatives who reportedly tried to coerce her into returning to Russia. After being questioned by police she was able to stay safely in Georgia.For other Chechen women who have fled, Aishat's death has reinvigorated a fear that has haunted them since they left Russia.Several have told the BBC how even before her murder they had steered clear of community events, avoided speaking Chechen in public and restricted their social media presence. Now they worry it may not be enough to hide from those who may want to punish them.\"The fear I've lived with all my life - embedded in my DNA - has reawakened with renewed vigour,\" said one escapee living in Western Europe, who asked to hide her name and precise location.\"It's like sleep paralysis: a monster appears, and I lie there frozen, staring into its eyes. It's the fear of being killed.\"\"You can escape,\" she said, \"but you never really feel free.\"",

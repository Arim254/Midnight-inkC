    "body": "20 hours agoKatya Adler Europe EditorBBCSomething in Europe has snapped. Donald Trump doubled down again on Monday night in his insistence that the US \"has to have\" Greenland for national security reasons. He predicted that Europe's leaders aren't \"gonna push back too much\". But that's not the plan they have in mind when their paths cross with the US president at the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Wednesday.Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark - a member of the EU and of Nato.President Trump is now leaning heavily on Denmark's allies in both those organisations to abandon Copenhagen and let the US take control of Greenland, or face punitive taxes on all their exports to the United States.It's a horror scenario for European economies, which are already in the doldrums, especially those reliant on exporting to the US like Germany's car industry and Italy's luxury goods market.AFP via Getty ImagesPolls suggest that 55% of Americans don't want to buy GreenlandOn Monday Germany's finance minister said “we will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed,” after an emergency meeting ahead of the WEF with his French counterpart.The Trump threats landed like a slap in the face of European governments, who (separately, in the case of the EU and the UK) had only just settled tariff deals with the US president last year.\"We're living through uncharted territories. We've never seen this before. An ally, a friend of 250 years, is considering using tariffs… as a geopolitical weapon,\" said France's Finance Minister Roland Lescure.His German counterpart Lars Klingbeil added: \"A line has been crossed... You'll understand that today I'm not saying exactly what will happen. But one thing must be clear: Europe must be prepared.\"All of a sudden, the softly-softly approach to Trump, that Europe's leaders had clearly favoured since he returned for a second term to the White House, seems to have passed its sell-by date.Europe's good cop, bad cop approachIt's too early to read the last rites on transatlantic relations altogether but the EU, at least, is hoping to approach the US president in Switzerland this Wednesday at the Global Economic Forum \"speaking softly, while carrying a big stick\" to paraphrase a former US president.Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt believed that, to achieve your goals, you need diplomacy backed by credible power. And Europe now seems to be adopting a good cop, bad cop approach.European leaders are telling President Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over Greenland.At the same time, EU diplomats have let it be known they're considering imposing €93 billion (£80 billion) worth of tariffs on US goods or even restricting the access of American businesses, possibly including banks and high tech companies - to the bloc's massive single market, if Trump goes ahead with his \"Greenland tariffs\" as they've become known.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesEuropean leaders are telling Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over GreenlandThese retaliatory measures would most likely have a knock-on effect on US consumers too.European Union investors have a massive presence in nearly all 50 US states and are said to be responsible for employing 3.4 million Americans.The EU has a weak voice on the world stage of international diplomacy. The bloc is made up of 27 often bickering countries. But it has huge clout when it comes to the global economy and trade, where decisions are largely taken by the European Commission on behalf of EU single market members. The European Union is the world's biggest trader of goods and services, accounting for nearly 16% of world trade in 2024.So, Brussels is crossing its fingers that President Trump will climb down from from his maximalist position and negotiate a compromise solution, if he realises, that he may end up gaining an island (Greenland) but he'll probably lose close allies (Europe), and be seen as responsible for US consumer costs going up (because of EU retaliatory tariffs).\"Our priority is to engage, not escalate,\" EU Commission deputy spokesperson Olof Gill said on Monday.WPA Pool/Getty ImagesEurope needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security\"Trump is forcing the Europeans to grow a spine,\" says Niclas Poitiers, an economist and expert in international trade at the Brussels-based Bruegel think-tank.\"[While] the damage of [Trump's] tariffs is very manageable for Europe… the much bigger question here is not economic but security and foreign policy.\"The EU cannot afford not to react.\"Trust in US security guaranteesBut on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared less than impressed.Speaking in Davos, he painted a picture of a US president with his mind set: \"The president is looking at Greenland as a strategic asset for the United States. We are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to anyone else.\"European tariff retaliation would be \"unwise\", he warned. And here Europe feels stuck. Damned if it takes action. Damned if it doesn't.Some in Europe worry that if they are now more confrontational with Trump, they risk alienating the US even further.And the brutal truth is: Europe needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security. Despite pledging more defence-spending, Europe is still heavily reliant on the US.Getty ImagesThe Danish Navy patrols near Nuuk, Greenland earlier this monthWhile also reiterating his support for Danish and Greenlandic sovereignty, Sir Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, was at pains to make that point on Monday, saying it was in the UK's \"national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence.\"Our nuclear deterrence is our foremost weapon. A deterrent when it comes to securing the safety of everybody in the United Kingdom is my primary duty and that requires us to have a good relationship with the United States.\"But, if Europe continues to try to \"manage\" president Trump, rather than stand up to him, when he is threatening the sovereignty of his fellow Nato ally (Denmark), and brandishing economic sanctions over other allies if they support Copenhagen, then the continent risks looking seriously weak.ShutterstockIt's in the UK's 'national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence,' Sir Keir Starmer has saidOn X on Monday the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas wrote, \"We have no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground\".As a former prime minister of Estonia, a country that fears the looming shadow of an expansionist Russia, she is keen to demonstrate to Moscow that Europe can - and will - bare its teeth, if pushed.\"Europeans can't shy away anymore,\" Tara Varma told me. She's an expert in security and geopolitics at think tank, German Marshall Fund.\"They tried personal diplomacy alone [with Donald Trump] over the last year, in order to try and tie him into Europe's collective defence and guaranteeing Ukraine's security after a ceasefire with Russia,\" she said.But if he can suddenly turn around (as he just has), linking economic and security issues and threatening Nato, if he doesn't get his way over a certain issue, then, she says, how much trust can Europe ultimately put in US security guarantees under this administration?\"Putin and the Board of PeaceWatching all this from the sidelines is not only Russia, but China. In their eyes the West - traditionally with the US and Europe tightly-knit at its core, dominant for decades in global politics - is now unravelling.The world is increasingly dominated by a number of big powers, including Russia and China, but also India, Saudi Arabia and, to an extent, Brazil.China hopes Donald Trump's apparent fickleness with his allies may make Beijing appear a more stable, reliable partner and drive more international trade its way.Canada, which President Trump had threatened to make the 51st state of the US, has just agreed to a limited trade deal with Beijing. It's trying to reduce its exposure to Washington.AFP via GettyThe Kremlin has said that Vladimir Putin was invited to join the Board of PeaceThe US president has also shown little regard for multilateral institutions like Nato and the United Nations set up by western powers after the second world war, to manage global order.Some point to the Board of Peace that President Trump is now establishing, and that he reportedly wants to stage a signing ceremony for this Thursday in Davos. Many world leaders and leading business figures are attending the conference.The Board is ostensibly designed to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza after Israel's devastating two year offensive, aimed at destroying Hamas following its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.But the Board's charter calls for \"a more nimble and effective international peace-building body\", suggesting its remit would be far wider, possibly to rival the UN.AFP via Getty ImagesFrance does not plan to accept an invitation that it has received to join the Board of Peace, according to a sourceThat's how France's President sees it. A source close to Emmanuel Macron issued a statement on Monday saying that France did not plan to accept an invitation that, \"along with many countries\", it had received to join the Board of Peace.\"The [Board's] Charter... raises major questions, particularly with regard to respect for the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question under any circumstances,\" the statement reads.The Kremlin said on Monday that Vladimir Putin had also been asked to join the Board, suggesting that Trump is keen to maintain ties with the Russian president, despite Moscow's four-year long assault on Ukraine and its failure so far to accept a US-backed peace plan.Questions have been raised too about Trump's overarching role on the Board, and his demand that world leaders pay $1 billion for permanent membership.More from InDepthBut Tara Varma insists that the Peace Board isn't about peace. \"How can it be, if you invite leaders like Putin to be part of it?\"Trump wants to be seen as a peacemaker. He wants the headlines, but without doing the hard graft to lay the groundwork needed for peace to be durable. His is more of a hit and run strategy.\"He can't replace multilateral institutions like the UN that have been around for 80 years.\"Relations are strained but not brokenPerhaps, though, President Trump, with his flouting of decades-old international norms, is shaking some of these multilateral institutions up a bit, pushing or even forcing them to modernise and become more relevant.The membership of the UN security council should arguably be less western-centric, and more representative of changes in global power structures.Nato's European members have admitted they ought to be paying more for their own defence. Trump is not the first US president to say that they should, though he's far blunter.It was after he threatened that the US would no longer defend nations that didn't pay their way, that all Nato members except Spain agreed to dramatically increase security spending.Back to Greenland, polls suggest 55% of Americans don't want to buy the island and 86% oppose a military takeover by the US. Denmark and other European powers have been lobbying lawmakers on Capitol Hill to persuade them that Greenlandic and Danish sovereignty must be protected.Getty ImagesAsked if he was prepared to use force to seize Greenland, President Trump said, \"No comment\", sending chills down the spine of many GreenlandersTransatlantic relations aren't broken yet, though they are damaged. Donald Trump is still picking up the phone to his pal, the Italian premier, Giorgia Meloni, to Starmer, and to Nato's Secretary General Mark Rutte. Lines of communication are still open.Ultimately, though, if Europeans want to try to cut through with Donald Trump, they will have to stick together.Not only the EU's disparate member states, not just Nato: all countries together. And the UK, with its closer relationship with the US will be key here.But Europe's leaders are torn between wanting to do what they see as right internationally, and their own domestic concerns. If a full-blown transatlantic trade war were to break out, that would hurt their voters.All singing from the same sheet over Greenland for any length of time, is going to be tough.Top picture credits: Getty Images and Getty/Bloomberg/LightrocketBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Shock and confusion as Spain struggles for answers after deadly train crash11 hours agoGuy Hedgecoein Adamuz, southern SpainReutersSpain's King Felipe (far right) visited the crash site with Queen Letizia on TuesdaySunday's high-speed train crash in southern Spain, the worst in over a decade, has been a devastating tragedy for the country, with the loss of at least 42 lives.And amid the grief, many are asking what could have caused such a failure on one of Europe's most admired rail systems.The CIAF rail investigatory commission has started analysing why a train travelling north from Málaga was derailed on a straight section of the route, causing it to collide with an oncoming train, which was also derailed. The Spanish government has described the accident as \"extremely strange\".Three bodies already located in the wreckage were recovered on Tuesday afternoon, and a 42nd victim was also found at the crash site near Adamuz.The shock felt in this sleepy town has been compounded by confusion at how a rail route that ran efficiently for so long suddenly failed.After its inauguration in 1992, Spain's high-speed rail, or AVE, network was seen as a symbol of the country's modernisation. Built with EU funds, it provided a state-of-the-art transport system that was fast, efficient and safe.A derailment near Santiago de Compostela in 2013 that killed 80 people was not part of the AVE network, although that train was travelling at high speed. Sunday's collision, however, took place on the oldest AVE route, that which connects Madrid with Andalusia.Watch: At the scene of Spain's worst rail disaster in over a decadeSeveral officials, including the president of Renfe, the national rail operator, Álvaro Fernández Heredia, said that human error was almost certainly not the cause of the accident, given that neither train was travelling at an excessive speed. Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska insisted that sabotage was not a possible cause.Inevitably, investigators are looking closely at the train that derailed. Owned by Italian firm Iryo, it was manufactured in 2022. Transport Minister Óscar Puente said that carriage number six of the train was going to be examined closely, because it was the first to derail and it offered \"many pieces of the puzzle\".EPAGrieving Spaniards want answers about what caused the deadly crashHowever, investigators are also examining the section of track where the derailment occurred and intend to analyse parts of it in a laboratory. The revelation that part of the track at the crash site was broken has encouraged speculation that this might be the culprit. The government has been keen to play down such conclusions, pointing out that the track may have been damaged by the force of the collision.Some observers have drawn attention to possible underlying factors on the network. It has emerged that rail infrastructure administrator Adif drew attention to eight technical issues on the line near where the accident happened on social media over the last year. Most of those issues were related to signalling, and last summer one was discussed in the Senate.Adif has reduced the speed limit for the AVE along a 150-km (93-mile) stretch between Madrid and Barcelona, due to concerns about the state of the line. The new limit along that section is 160km/h, nearly half the previous limit.Since the collision, many social media users have flagged posts from the past in which they had complained about uncomfortable movement while travelling on AVE trains. One user filmed the interior of a train vigorously vibrating in December, commenting that it had caused them to \"fear for my safety and that of my daughter\".In August 2025, train drivers' union Semaf issued a communiqué warning that the state of a number of AVE lines was causing \"a lack of comfort and reliability\" for those travelling. It called for a reduction in speed limits in order to prevent further degradation of the infrastructure and \"to guarantee the safety of workers and travellers\".Such grievances might suggest that Spain's high-speed rail network is badly in need of an overhaul. However, the government counters that last year the section of track where the accident took place was renovated, at a cost of €49m (£42m), as part of a broader €700m investment to update the Madrid-Andalusia network in recent years.\"When we find the answer, with absolute transparency we will make it known to Spaniards,\" Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, said of the investigation, as he declared three day's mourning during his visit to Adamuz.That answer could have enormous significance for the future of Spain's renowned rail system.",

    "body": "A tribunal in Colombia has sentenced a former paramilitary leader, Salvatore Mancuso, to 40 years in prison for murders and forced disappearances committed at the height of the country's armed conflict.Mancuso was a commander in the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AUC), a right-wing paramilitary group originally created to defend landowners from attacks by Marxist guerrilla groups, which became involved in drug trafficking.The tribunal found that under his command, AUC members committed more than 100 crimes in La Guajira povince between 2002 and 2006.Mancuso was sent back to Colombia in 2024 after serving a 15-year prison sentence in the US for drug trafficking. The 61-year-old was sentenced on Monday by a special tribunal created to deal with cases arising from Colombia's decades-long armed conflict, in which at least 450,000 people were killed between 1985 and 2018 according to figures compiled by a truth commission.The tribunal said that Mancuso's 40-year-long sentence could be reduced to eight years if he agreed to work with the transitional justice and took part in reparation activities. Mancuso's name became a byword for the atrocities committed by AUC groups in the 1990s and early 2000s.The tribunal said that under his leadership the AUC had targeted members of the indigenous Wayuu group who live in La Guajira, in the far north of Colombia.It documented 117 crimes, including murders, forced disappearances and gender violence, committed by the AUC in the area.Indigenous groups were often caught in between warring factions of Colombia's armed conflict.Marxist rebel groups forcibly recruited many indigenous children into their ranks, holding them against their will in rebel camps where they had to perform chores and were sometimes forced to fight.The AUC and other paramilitary groups, which suspected the indigenous groups of siding with the rebels, drove them off their land and waged a campaign of terror and intimidation against them. The AUC negotiated a peace deal with the Colombian government in 2005 but offshoots of the group refused to lay down arms and became even more heavily involved in the trafficking of drugs, which they had already been engaging in to raise funds for their fight against the guerrilla. Mancuso was extradited to the US in 2008, where he was put on trial on drug trafficking charges. He was sentenced in 2015, after having been found guilty of smuggling large quantities of cocaine into the US \"to arm a paramilitary force of more than 30,000 fighters and cement his control over regions of Colombia\", the US justice department said at the time. After he had served his sentence in the US, Mancuso, a dual Colombian and Italian national, asked to be allowed to move to Italy. But his request was denied and he was deported to Colombia. There, he offered to provide testimony into how Colombian politicians, business leaders and other members of the country's establishment allegedly cooperated with the AUC.Pleased with his offer of co-operation, the government of Colombian President Gustavo Petro named Mancuso a \"promoter of peace\", saying he would act as a mediator between the administration and illegal armed groups still active in the country. The move was vehemently criticised by human rights groups who pointed to the atrocities his group carried out under his command. With additional reporting by BBC Monitoring's Latin America team. ",

According to local officials, on Tuesday evening the Rodalies train collided with a retaining wall which fell onto the track between Gelida and Sant Sadurní. Catalonia regional fire Inspector Claudi Gallardo said all passengers had been removed from the train.The incident occurred as heavy storms battered north-eastern Spain, as coastal areas in the east and north-west of Spain are on high alert because of the weather. Eleven ambulances were on the scene in Gelida, Catalonia - around 35km (21.7 miles) west of Barcelona - treating those injured, emergency services said.The local fire service said 35 crews had been sent to the area and one passenger trapped inside the train had been rescued.In a later update it said that no-one remained inside and that its crews were conducting a sweep of the area to rule out any further victims.Emergency services said they had evacuated some of the injured to nearby Moisès Broggi, Bellvitge, and Vila Franca hospitals.As well as the five seriously injured people, six were in a less serious condition and 26 were in a \"mild\" condition, emergency medical services said.MossosLocal police shared an image of emergency services at the scene near GélidaServices suspendedAnother train on the Barcelona commuter network also derailed on Tuesday.\"The axle was struck by a rock dislodged by the storm,\" Spain's rail network operator Adif said in a statement.The train was running between Blanes and Maçanet-Massanes, north-east of Barcelona.No injuries have been reported and services have been suspended.About 400,000 commuters are expected to be without train services on Wednesday morning, Spanish newspaper El Pais reported.Services across the Rodalies commuter rail network have been suspended completely while safety checks are carried out.Rail operators are expected to meet with authorities after the inspections.The crashes in Catalonia come two days after two high-speed trains collided in Adamuz, Andalusia, in one of the worst Spanish rail accidents in over a decade.At least 42 people are known to have died after carriages on a Madrid-bound train derailed and crossed over to the opposite tracks and then collided with an oncoming high-speed train.",

    "body": "Usha Vance, the wife of Vice-President JD Vance, has announced she is pregnant with her fourth child. In a post on X, the second lady said she is looking forward to welcoming a boy in late July. \"Usha and the baby are doing well,\" a statement posted on Tuesday to the second lady's social media account read. Vance and his wife, Usha, 40, have three young children: Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel.Usha Vance (née Chilukuri) was born and raised in the working-class suburbs of San Diego, California, to a mechanical engineer father and a molecular biologist mother who had moved to the US from Andhra Pradesh, India.She met JD Vance as a student at Yale Law School in 2010, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".Before becoming second lady, Usha Vance had a legal career, including a job as a corporate litigator at firm Munger, Tolles & Olson in San Francisco. She also worked for conservative judges, Chief Justice John Roberts on the Supreme Court and appeals court judge Brett Kavanaugh, before he was appointed by Trump to the Supreme Court. Usha Vance is the first to have a baby as second lady, though other first ladies have had children while their husbands were in office. First lady Frances Cleveland, wife of President Grover Cleveland, gave birth to daughter Esther in the White House in 1893, followed by a second child, Marion, who was born outside the White House. JD Vance has been one of the most vocal members of the Trump administration in calling for higher birth rates in the US. \"Let me say very simply: I want more babies in the United States of America,\" he said in 2025.

    "description": "Beijing has demanded the Taliban government protect its citizens after an explosion at a Chinese restaurant in the Afghan capital Kabul killed at leas",
    "body": "Beijing has demanded the Taliban government protect its citizens after an explosion at a Chinese restaurant in the Afghan capital Kabul killed at least seven people.Six Afghans and one Chinese national were killed, and several more injured, in the blast at a Chinese restaurant in a heavily-guarded part of the city centre on Monday, officials told the media.The jihadist group Islamic State (IS) said it was behind the attack - although police in Kabul said the \"nature of the explosion is unknown so far and is being investigated\".China has urged its citizens not to travel to Afghanistan, where the Taliban seized control in 2021. Islamic State has claimed numerous bombings since then.  Speaking on Tuesday, Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun added that China had \"made urgent representations with the Afghan side, demanding that the Afghan side spare no effort to treat the injured, further take effective measures to protect the safety of Chinese citizens\". City police spokesman Khalid Zadran said the explosion took place near the kitchen of the Chinese Noodle restaurant, which is located under a guesthouse in the  capital's Shahr-e-Naw area.Dejan Panic, the Afghanistan director of humanitarian group EMERGENCY, said they received \"20 people\" at their hospital, seven of whom were dead on arrival. Four women and a child were also among the injured.Footage circulating on social media of the aftermath of the explosion showed a large hole torn in the side of the building, Reuters news agency said.Eyewitnesses told BBC Afghan that a car outside the restaurant had been completely destroyed, and that locals had helped rush people in \"critical condition\" to hospital. Large sheets were later put up to cover the damaged building.Police spokesman Zadran said the restaurant mainly served Chinese Muslims, and was run by a Chinese Muslim man from the Chinese region of Xinjiang, his wife and his Afghan business partner.In its statement, the local branch of IS said that China was on \"the list\" of its targets, especially given China's \"increasing crimes against the oppressed Uyghur Muslims\".China has been accused of committing crimes against humanity against the Uyghur population and other mostly-Muslim ethnic groups in the north-western region of Xinjiang.The Chinese government has denied all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang.IS has previously said it was behind an attack on a Chinese-owned hotel in Kabul back in 2022, in which three of the attackers died and at least two other people were injured. More recently, Chinese nationals just over the border in Tajikistan have been targeted by unknown attackers. In November, six Chinese nationals were killed in three separate incidents. Beijing has told its citizens to leave the Tajik-Afghan border.",

    "body": "14 hours agoHugh Schofield,Paris correspondentandPaul Pradier,in ParisFrench officials have made their first interception on the water as part of a new policy aimed at stopping small boats carrying illegal migrants to the UK.A so-called \"taxi-boat\" was boarded by French officers on Saturday on the Aa canal in Gravelines, which is on the Channel coast above Calais.It follows a change of tactics agreed in November following growing pressure from the UK government to step up interventions.A photograph of the aftermath of the operation obtained by the BBC shows a number of men - apparently people-smugglers - on an inflatable dinghy with the police launch alongside. The inflatable is then towed to the dockside.The French maritime prefecture declined to comment to the BBC, saying only that there was \"an ongoing judicial investigation\" regarding the small boat.France agreed to the new tactics at a summit in the UK last July between President Emmanuel Macron and Sir Keir Starmer.Until then French police had only intervened to stop small boats as they were being prepared for launch on beaches. Intervening at sea was judged to be too dangerous.But smugglers' gangs learned to avoid police by using \"taxi-boats\", which enter the water some distance away and then travel along the coast picking up groups of migrants who themselves enter the water to get aboard.According to an official French documents, this method was proving extremely effective, with an 81% success rate in 2025.The number of migrants who reached the UK from France rose last year from 36,566 in 2024 to 41,472, but it was lower than the peak of 45,774 in 2022.After the July 2025 agreement to start on-water interventions, there were more delays because of worries about the risk to life, and about officers' liability to prosecution were migrants to die in an operation.These concerns appear now to have been addressed.  Under the terms of engagement, gendarmes will only intervene to stop \"taxi-boats\" before they take on migrants – and not when they are fully charged.This seems to have been the procedure used in Saturday's operation. Police suspected that the inflatable, which was moving down the canal to its mouth at the sea, was about to be used for picking up migrants, so they moved to arrest the men on board.",

    "body": "7 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterElon Musk has suggested he could buy Ryanair and called for its chief executive to be fired amid a deepening spat between the pair. The budget airline on Tuesday branded the Tesla chief executive an \"idiot\", and used the extraordinary row to promote its January sale. Musk and Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary have been trading insults over the past week after O'Leary rejected the idea of using Musk's Starlink technology to provide wi-fi on flights.The two are among the world's most outspoken business chiefs, with Musk the world's richest man with an estimated net worth of $769bn (£573bn), and O'Leary running Europe's busiest airline. A statement on Ryanair's X account on Tuesday evening said: \"Perhaps Musk needs a break??\"Ryanair is launching a Great Idiots seat sale especially for Elon and any other idiots on 'X'.\" It came after Musk floated the idea of buying Ryanair several times on X in the past week, suggesting that O'Leary should be sacked for rejecting the use of Starlink to provide wi-fi on Ryanair flights.EU-based airlines must be majority owned by people from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein.The Irish airline also said O'Leary would hold a press conference in Dublin on Wednesday to \"address\" Musk's latest move.Ryanair's social media is known for its punchy posts, often mocking criticisms of the airline or weighing in on current events.Last week, after German airline Lufthansa announced it would install Starlink on its planes to provide all passengers with free wi-fi, O'Leary said Musk knew \"zero\" about flight aerodynamics.He told Irish radio station Newstalk that passengers would not want to pay a small charge for wi-fi on an hour-long flight, and that Starlink hardware would increase fuel costs because of drag.\"We [would] have to put an aerial antenna on top of the aircraft. It would cost us about $200-250m a year, in other words about an extra dollar for every passenger we fly.\"We can't afford those costs. Passengers won't pay for internet usage... so we're not putting it on board.\"O'Leary called Musk an \"idiot\", with Musk using the same insult in response.Airlines have become increasingly important for Starlink, a network powered by thousands of low-earth orbit satellites.The technology is already being rolled out by airlines such as Qatar Airways and United Airlines.Both Musk and O'Leary have been known to court media attention with provocative public statements.",

    "body": "14 hours agoWatch: Veronika the cow shows off her unique skillsScientists are rethinking what cattle are capable of after an Austrian cow named Veronika was found to use tools with impressive skill. The discovery, reported by researchers in Vienna, suggests cows may have far greater cognitive abilities than previously assumed.Veronika, a cow living in a mountain village in the Austrian countryside, has spent years perfecting the art of scratching herself using sticks, rakes, and brooms. Word of her behaviour eventually reached animal intelligence specialists in Vienna, who found Veronika used both ends of the same object for different tasks. Antonio J Osuna MascaróVeronika, a Swiss brown cow living in AustriaIf it were her back or another tough area that warranted a good scratch, she would use the bristle end of a broom. When a softer touch was needed, such as on her sensitive underbelly, she would use the smooth handle end.This kind of tool use is rarely seen in the animal kingdom and has never been documented in cattle before.Dr Antonio Osuna-Mascaro of the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna said: \"We were not expecting cows to be able to use tools, and we were not expecting a cow to use a tool as a multipurpose tool. Until now this has only been consistently reported in chimpanzees.\"Getty ImagesChimpanzees show sophisticated tool use, such as using a stick to get fruit from a boxChimpanzees show the most varied range of tool use outside of humans. They use sticks to gather ants and termites, and stones to crack nuts.However, despite about 10,000 years of humans living alongside cattle, this is the first time scientists have documented a cow using a tool.The researchers say their discovery shows that cows are smarter than we think and that other cows could develop similar skills, given the chance.As for Veronika's owner, organic farmer Witgar Wiegele, he hopes her unexpected talents will inspire people to value the natural world. As he puts it: \"Save the nature, then you protect yourself. Nature diversity is the key to survive on this planet.\"The study is published in the journal Current Biology.",

    "body": "5 hours agoHideharu Tamura,TokyoandKelly Ng,SingaporeThere is little question that the man who killed Japan's former prime minister Shinzo Abe in 2022 will be convicted when the court delivers its verdict – Tetsuya Yamagami himself pleaded guilty to the crime at the trial's opening last year.The 45-year-old is set to be sentenced on Wednesday but what punishment he deserves has divided public opinion in Japan. While many see Yamagami as a cold-blooded murderer, some sympathise with his troubled upbringing.Prosecutors have demanded life in prison for the \"grave act\" of shooting Abe dead. The former PM was a huge figure in public life in Japan, where there is virtually no gun crime - and the country was left stunned by his assassination.Seeking leniency, Yamagami's defence team say he was a victim of \"religious abuse\".  His mother's devotion to the Unification Church bankrupted the family, and Yamagami bore a grudge against Abe after realising the ex-leader's ties to the  controversial church.Abe's shocking death while giving a speech in broad daylight prompted investigations into the Unification Church and its questionable practices, including soliciting financially ruinous donations from its followers.The case also exposed links with politicians from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party and resulted in the resignations of several cabinet ministers.Journalist Eito Suzuki, who covered all but one of Yamagami's court hearings, said Yamagami and his family seemed \"overwhelmed with despair\" throughout the trial.Yamagami \"exuded a sense of world-weariness and resignation\", recounts Suzuki, who began looking into the Unification Church long before Abe's shocking murder.\"Everything is true. There is no doubt that I did this,\" Yamagami said solemnly on the first day of his trial in October 2025. Armed with a homemade gun assembled using two metal pipes and duct tape, he fired two shots at Abe during a political campaign event in the western city of Nara on 8 July 2022.The murder of Japan's most recognisable public figure at the time – Abe remains the longest-serving PM in Japanese history – sent shockwaves around the world.Calling for a jail term of no more than 20 years, Yamagami's lawyers argued that he was a victim of \"religious abuse\". He resented the church because his mother donated to it his late father's life insurance and other assets, amounting to 100 million yen (S$828,750), the court heard.Yamagami spoke of his grievance against Abe after seeing his video message at a church-related event in 2021, but said he had initially planned to attack church executives, not Abe. Suzuki recalls Abe's widow Akie's look of disbelief when Yamagami said the ex-leader was not his main target. Her expression \"remains vividly etched in my mind\", Suzuki says.\"It conveyed a sense of shock, like she was asking: Was my husband merely a tool used to settle a grudge against the religious organisation? Is that all it was?\" In an emotional statement read to the court, Akie Abe said the sorrow of losing her husband \"will never be relieved\". \"I just wanted him to stay alive,\" she had said.Founded in South Korea, the Unification Church entered Japan in the 1960s and cultivated ties with politicians to grow its following, researchers say.While not a member, Abe, like several other Japanese politicians, would occasionally appear at church-related events. His grandfather Nobusuke Kishi, also a former PM, was said to have been close to the group because of its anti-communist stance.In March last year, a Tokyo court revoked the church's status as a religious corporation, ruling that it coerced followers into buying expensive items by exploiting fears about their spiritual well-being.The church has also drawn controversy for holding mass wedding ceremonies involving thousands of couples.Yamagami's sister, who appeared as a defence witness during his trial, gave a tearful testimony on the \"dire circumstances she and her siblings endured\" because of their mother's deep involvement with the church, Suzuki recalls.\"It was an intensely emotional moment. Nearly everyone in the public gallery appeared to be crying,\" he says.But prosecutors argue there is \"a leap in logic\" as to why Yamagami directed his resentment of the church at Abe. During the trial, the judges also raised questions suggesting they found it hard to understand this aspect of his defence.Observers, too, are divided on whether Yamagami's personal tragedies justify a reduced penalty for his actions.\"It's hard to dismantle the prosecution's case that Abe didn't directly harm Yamagami or his family,\" Suzuki says. But he believes Yamagami's case illustrates how \"victims of social problems are led to commit serious crimes\". \"This chain must be broken, we must properly examine why he committed the crime,\" Suzuki says.Rin Ushiyama, a sociologist at Queen's University Belfast, says sympathy for Yamagami is largely rooted in \"widespread distrust and antipathy in Japan towards controversial religions like the Unification Church\".\"Yamagami was certainly a 'victim' of parental neglect and economic hardship caused by the [Unification Church], but this does not explain, let alone justify, his [actions],\" Ushiyama says.",

    "body": "13 hours agoHelen Livingstone,SydneyandSimon Fraser,LondonAustralia's parliament has voted for sweeping gun law reforms and a crackdown on hate speech, a month after two attackers shot 15 people dead at a Jewish festival at Bondi Beach.Both bills passed the House of Representatives and Senate at a special sitting late on Tuesday. The gun reform measures include a national gun buyback scheme and new checks on firearm licence applications.Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the Bondi gunmen would not legally have had access to firearms if such a law had been in place prior to the attack, the country's worst mass shooting in decades.Governing Labor senators were backed on the anti-hate bill by Liberal lawmakers, whose coalition partners abstained.After last month's mass shooting, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese came under huge pressure for not having done enough to prevent the attack in the first place, amid growing fears of antisemitism in the Jewish community. Politicians were recalled two weeks early to debate the legislation. Introducing the reforms, Burke said individuals with \"hate in their hearts and guns in their hands\" had carried out the 14 December attack.The father in the father-son duo allegedly behind the attack legally owned six firearms, while his son had been on the radar of intelligence agencies. The gun reform bill, which cleared the House of Representatives by 96 votes to 45, includes stricter firearm import controls and provisions to improve information sharing between intelligence agencies on people trying to obtain gun licences. The buyback scheme will target \"surplus and newly restricted firearms\", Burke said, reducing the country's four million registered guns.Burke added that it \"comes as a shock to most Australians\" to know that the country has more firearms that it did before the 1996 Port Arthur attack, in which a gunman killed 35 people in Tasmania. That attack, the country's worst mass shooting, had prompted the then government to introduce some of the world's strictest gun controls. The new law will bring in some of the most significant changes to Australia's guns laws since then.The hate speech reforms had originally been included in an omnibus bill with the gun reforms but the government split the legislation last week after both the Liberal-National opposition coalition and the Greens said they would vote against.While the Labor government has a comfortable majority in the lower house, it needs the support of other parties in the Senate.Coalition MPs cited concerns about free speech and said the legislation was not clearly defined, among other things, while the Greens said they could not support it unless changes were made to protect all minorities and legitimate protest.But on Tuesday, Liberals leader Sussan Ley, who last week said the bill was \"unsalvageable\", said her party had reached agreement with the government on a watered-down version.The Liberals had \"stepped up to fix legislation\" that the government had \"mishandled\", she said in a statement, adding that the bill had been \"narrowed, strengthened and properly focused on keeping Australians safe\".The bill includes provisions that will ban groups deemed to spread hate and introduce tougher penalties for preachers who advocate violence. It will be subject to a review every two years by a parliamentary joint committee. The opposition will also be consulted on the listing and delisting of extremist organisations.The bill was passed by the lower house and late in the evening it cleared the Senate - by 38 votes to 22 - after the National Party abstained while their Liberal coalition partners voted in favour. The Greens voted against, saying it would have a \"chilling effect\" on political debate and protest.",

    "body": "50 minutes agoTabby WilsonWatch: BBC asks if breakup of Nato is price Trump willing to pay for GreenlandUS president Donald Trump has doubled down on his threats to take control of Greenland, saying on social media that there is \"no going back\" and that \"Greenland is imperative\". During a news conference at the White House, Trump was asked how far he was willing to go to acquire Greenland and replied, \"You'll find out\".  Meanwhile, French president Emmanuel Macron warned at a meeting at the World Economic Forum meeting in Switzerland of a \"shift towards a world without rules\", while Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the \"old order is not coming back\".Trump is due to arrive in Davos on Wednesday, where he has said there are \"a lot of meetings scheduled on Greenland\". During the lengthy press briefing, Trump also told reporters that \"things are going to work out pretty well\" in Greenland. Asked by the BBC whether the possible break up of the Nato alliance was a price the president was willing to pay for Greenland, he responded, \"Nobody has done more for Nato than I have, in every way,\" and said \"Nato is going to be happy and we are going to be happy,\" adding, \"We need it for world security.\" But he earlier questioned whether Nato would come to aid of the US, should it be required. \"I know we'll come to (Nato's) rescue, but I just really do question whether or not they'll come to ours,\" he told reporters. Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - currently has 32 member states, with the US one of the 12 founding countries. Designed to safeguard freedom and security through a collective defence, one of the core principles of the Nato alliance is outlined in Article 5, which says that an armed attack against one or more members will be considered an attack against all.Trump has not ruled out using military force to acquire Greenland; when NBC News asked yesterday whether he would use force to seize the territory, the president replied \"no comment\".ReutersIn an interview with BBC Newsnight on Tuesday evening, Greenland's Minister of Industry and Natural Resources, Naaja Nathanielsen, said that Greenlanders were \"bewildered\" by the president's demands. \"We do not want to be Americans, and we have been quite clear about that,\" Nathanielsen said. \"What value do you put on our culture and our right to decide what happens with us in the future?\"Trump is shaking the world order more than any president since WW2Confronted over Greenland, Europe is ditching its softly-softly approach to TrumpWhy does Trump want Greenland and what could it mean for Nato and the EU?Ahead of the forum in Davos, Trump shared screenshots that he says showed text messages sent to him by Macron and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte.In them, Rutte said he was committed to finding a way forward on Greenland, while Macron said he \"does not understand what you are doing\", but offered to organise a meeting with other leaders in Paris.The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, addressed the matter directly in a speech to attendees on Tuesday, which was the first day of the forum, emphasising that Europe is \"fully committed\" when it comes to the security of the Arctic.However, she said that this could only be achieved together, and called Trump's proposed additional tariffs \"a mistake\".The US president has said he will add a 10% tariff to \"any and all goods\" imported from eight European countries from 1 February if they opposed his proposed takeover of Greenland.In her speech, Von der Leyen added that the European Union stands in \"full solidarity\" with Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark – adding that their sovereignty is \"non-negotiable\".Her words were echoed by Canada's Mark Carney, who said that his country's commitment to Nato's Article 5 – which states an armed attack against one or more members is considered an attack against all – is \"unwavering\".\"We stand firmly with Greenland and Denmark and fully support their unique right to determine Greenland's future,\" Carney said.In Macron's remarks, he said he preferred \"respect to bullies\" and the \"rule of law to brutality\".Earlier on Tuesday, Trump threatened a 200% tariff on French wine and champagne after Macron reportedly declined an invitation to join the Gaza \"Board of Peace\".The French president condemned the \"endless accumulation of new tariffs\" as \"fundamentally unacceptable\", particularly when used as leverage against territorial sovereignty.Macron is among those urging the EU to consider retaliatory options against US tariffs, including the anti-coercion instrument, nicknamed a \"trade bazooka\".Sources close to the international trade committee have said that the European Parliament is planning to suspend approval of the US trade deal agreed in July, in a move that would mark another escalation in tensions between the US and Europe.",

    "body": "2 days agoThomas Naadi,BBC Africa, Accra andJean OtalorCyber Security AuthorityThe authorities released pictures of some of those found in the raids along with their equipmentGhana's security forces have arrested nine Nigerians suspected of co-ordinating a host of cyber-crime activities from makeshift offices in and around the capital, Accra.Forty-four others, believed to be victims brought to Ghana from Nigeria under false pretences, have also been detained and handed over to the immigration authority.During the two-day intelligence-led operation, raids uncovered 62 laptops, 52 mobile phones and two pump-action guns, the authorities have said.There is a growing trend of foreigners being lured to Ghana under the pretext of lucrative work. They are then put in gated compounds, have their documents confiscated and are compelled to engage in cyber-crime.They often work on romance scams, where a victim is encouraged to send money to a fictitious partner who they believe is real, or business email compromise, where someone poses as an employer and gets people to sends funds or sensitive data.The weekend's operation was jointly co-ordinated by a host of agencies, including the Cyber Security Authority (CSA).''All the arrested individuals have been duly profiled and handed over to the Ghana Immigration Service for safekeeping and further investigations,\" Communications Minister Sam George said in a post on X.\"We caution foreign nationals invited to Ghana to verify claims made by their fellow nationals to lure them here.''George also indicated that suspects arrested in previous recent operations have been handed over to Nigerian law enforcement or are facing prosecution.The CSA and other agencies have been making efforts to flush out cyber-criminals, including working with the US authorities to arrest high-profile suspects. Among recent operations was the arrest of a popular Ghanaian social media influencer known as Abu Trica, whose real name is Frederick Kumi, who allegedly stole $8m (£5.9m) from vulnerable Americans through a romance scam. He has not yet commented on the allegations.Another successful operation was the dismantling of a syndicate that defrauded over 200 victims of $400,000 (£300,000).You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcastsMore from the BBC",

    "body": "10 hours agoLaura Gozziin KyivReutersZelensky said repelling Monday night's attack had cost Ukraine about €80m (£69m) just in terms of air defence missilesA large Russian aerial strike on Ukraine has left the Ukrainian parliament and half of Kyiv's residential buildings without heating or power as temperatures across the country continue to hover around -10C.President Volodymyr Zelensky, in his evening address on Tuesday, said one million people in the capital remained without power.Drones, ballistic and cruise missiles targeted several locations in Ukraine overnight, including Kyiv, Dnipro in the centre and Odesa in the south.Zelensky said earlier a \"significant number\" of targets had been intercepted. But he also said that, in terms of air defence missile prices alone, repelling that attack had cost Ukraine about €80m (£69m).Between Monday and Tuesday, at least four people died and 33 others were injured in strikes across Ukraine.Air raid alerts in Kyiv lasted most of the night. Sirens rang out later as Russian drones and cruise missiles approached the capital.On Tuesday morning, more than 5,600 residential buildings – each with dozens of flats – in Kyiv woke up to no heating. A large part of the capital also has no water.Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said almost 80% of those buildings had just had their heating restored following a large-scale attack on 9 January, which knocked out power for much of the city. Since then, relentless efforts by technicians had managed to reinstate electricity and gas for thousands - only for that work to be undone overnight.\"I have no electricity and no water,\" Oleksandr Palii, a 29-year-old veteran, told the BBC. \"I didn't sleep until 3am because of the strikes either – there were explosions all night.\"Parliament speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk said that, just like Ukrainian cities, the Verkhovna Rada was also without basic services of electricity, water and heating, and he called other parliaments not to remain silent.The Ukrainian president had been due to travel to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday but, in the wake of the overnight strikes, he said he had decided to stay in Kyiv.He would travel to Davos only if documents on security guarantees with the United States and a prosperity plan were ready to be signed, he added.Temperatures have stayed well below freezing since the start of the year. Ukrainian media has reported instances of radiators bursting due to the water in them freezing, leading to flooding in entire buildings. There have also been reports of fires starting due to people using gas heaters indoor.As the power cuts continue, Kyiv residents are finding innovative solutions to carry on living. Many now use portable stoves to cook, and entire buildings chip in to buy generators. But much depends on individual financial capacities.\"I think people who are less well-off are coping much worse,\" says Olha Zasiadvovk, who has a young child. She and other parents have bought lamps and thermal containers for their children's kindergarten \"so that when the kitchen has no electricity they can cook all the meals at once and store them.\"But if electricity is only available sporadically, she says, \"the food doesn't keep very well. There were cases when food was cooked in the morning and by dinner the porridge had become completely solid.\"In recent days, videos have circulated on social media showing Ukrainians barbecuing in snowy yards and dancing to keep warm in the face of continued power cuts and freezing temperatures. But many say this is the worst winter since the start of the full-scale war in 2022, and with no end to hostilities in sight, nerves are frayed.ReutersAround 10,000 people sought shelter in Kyiv's metro stations overnight\"The resilience of the Ukrainian people cannot be an excuse for this war to continue. It must end as soon as possible,\" said Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha‎ on Tuesday.The Kyiv city administration said more than 10,000 people, including nearly 800 children, took refuge in the city's metro stations on Monday night.Many of the high-rise buildings that are often hit by drones do not have shelters, so the deep metro system is still the only place people can seek safety as the thudding sounds of air defence systems ring overhead. President Zelensky said Ukraine had received missiles to repel the overnight attack on Monday, and added they had helped significantly.But he also emphasised the need for air defence systems was still critical. In a call with reporters, he said Russia was using \"far more\" ballistic missiles in its attacks and that Moscow's capacity to produce them had not been dented. \"So far, this has not happened. That is why we need more missiles and more air defence systems,\" he said.A flurry of diplomatic activity in late 2025 gave rise to hope that progress was being made towards a peace deal with Russia.But on Tuesday Zelensky hinted at concerns that growing tensions between the US and Europe could be detrimental to Ukraine's ability to defend itself. As it stands, Kyiv's European partners are buying missiles from the US on Ukraine's behalf.\"When it comes to [protection from] ballistic missiles, for now the key is in the hands of the United States of the America,\" he said.\"It is very important that deliveries are timely, that production works, and that partners help us purchase the necessary missiles,\" Zelensky stressed. \"In other words, a great deal in the security of Ukrainians depends on the unity of Europe and America.\"Additional reporting by Liubov Sholudko.",

    "body": "Togo has arrested and extradited Burkina Faso's former leader to his home country, after authorities in Ouagadougou accused him of plotting to kill his successor.Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba - who came to power in a coup in 2022 before himself being overthrown by Ibrahim Traoré eight months later - is accused by the current regime of masterminding an assassination attempt against Traoré.According to the Togolese justice ministry, Damiba was handed over to the Burkinabè authorities on Saturday.It says as part of the deal, Burkina Faso promised to ensure \"physical integrity, dignity and fair‑trial rights of Mr Paul‑Henri Sandaogo Damiba, and the absence of the death penalty\". Among the charges levelled at Damiba by Burkina Faso's military government are \"criminal embezzlement of public funds, illicit enrichment, corruption, aggravated receiving of stolen goods and money laundering\", said Togo's justice ministry in a statement.No comments from Damiba on the charges have been reported and neither have the BBC's calls to him been picked up.Most serious are the murder plot allegations. Earlier this month, Burkina Faso's Security Minister Mahamadou Sana announced on state television that security forces had foiled a planned series of targeted assassinations aimed at destabilising the state, including what he called the \"neutralisation\" of Traoré.Officials in Ouagadougou have repeatedly accused Damiba of orchestrating plots from exile. In late 2024, he was again named publicly as the head of what authorities described as the \"military wing\" of a broader conspiracy.Damiba first seized power in January 2022, toppling the elected government of Roch Marc Christian Kaboré amid frustration over the state's failure to curb Islamist violence.But after just eight months, he was himself overthrown by Traoré, then a 34‑year‑old artillery officer who accused him of failing to deliver security improvements.Since then, the Traoré-led junta has tightened its grip on the country, expelling French forces, adopting an assertive nationalist stance and recently reinstating the death penalty, including for crimes of high treason.Despite promises to restore order, Burkina Faso remains mired in one of the world's most severe security crises, with militant jihadist attacks continuing across large parts of the country.The return of Damiba to Burkina Faso, under arrest and possibly facing a long list of criminal charges, is expected to escalate tensions within the military and political establishment.Political observers suggest that repeated accusations, foiled plots and widening divisions within the armed forces will likely lead to questions about the stability of a government still confronting both a brutal insurgency and internal rivalries.Additional reporting by Natasha Booty",

    "body": "10 hours agoBethany BellGetty ImagesPolice believe the man who died had climbed into the vehicle without being noticed (file pic)An 82-year-old German man who was in a car at a scrapyard in Munich has been crushed to death by a crane.In a statement, police said the car was intended to be scrapped and the man must have climbed into it without being noticed.The incident took place at the site of a firm in the Obersendling district of Munich on Wednesday afternoon and news of it has just been made public.Police said it happened when a 60-year-old employee at the firm was operating the heavy excavation equipment used to scrap old cars.The employee used the crane to crush the roof of the car and then turned the vehicle onto its roof.Police said it was only at this point that a witness noticed there was someone inside the car.The 82-year-old suffered fatal injuries when the car roof was crushed.Emergency services were alerted and firefighters, paramedics, and police officers attended.The fire service had to use special equipment to recover the man's body from the car.According to a police spokesperson, the car did not belong to the man who died.It is believed the victim, who lived in Munich, may have been at the site to collect scrap metal.Munich traffic police have launched an investigation into the accident.",

    "body": "First writing may be 40,000 years earlier than thought17 hours agoGeorgina RannardScience reporterUniversity of Tübingen / Hildegard JensenA 40,000-year-old mammoth figurine with engraved rows of crosses and dotsThe history of writing down thoughts and feelings could be tens of thousands of years older than previously believed, surprising archaeologists who made the discovery.The researchers discerned patterns of meaning in lines, notches, dots, and crosses on objects like mammoth tusks as old as 45,000 years in caves in Germany.Traditionally historians date the first written words to proto-cuneiform scripts made around 5,000 years ago in ancient Iraq, or Mesopotamia.The precise meaning of the symbols in Germany remains a mystery.The objects are from just before Homo sapiens moved to Europe from Africa where they interacted with Neanderthals.Until now it was thought that writing developed in Mesopotamia around 3,000 BCE, followed by hieroglyphics in Egypt and later in China and Mesoamerica.\"The Stone Age sign sequences are an early alternative to writing,\" says Prof Christian Bentz from Saarland University, an author of the new research.The work suggests that Stone Age people were as clever as modern-day humans, according to researcher Ewa Dutkiewicz from Berlin's Museum of Prehistory and Early History.\"So far, we've only scratched the surface of what can be found in terms of symbol sequences on a wide variety of artifacts,\" she says.The team analysed more than 3,000 characters on 260 objects to uncover what they call the DNA of writing.Some of the objects are from a 37-km long cave system called the Lonetal in Baden-Württemberg, southern Germany.Landesmuseum Württemberg / Hendrik ZwietaschThe so-called \"adorant\" has a human-like figure and several rows of notches and dots. On a small mammoth carved from tusk, the researchers analysed carefully engraved rows of crosses and dots.And on an artefact called \"adorant\" from the Geißenklösterle cave in the Achtal valley, they identified rows of dots and notches on an ivory plaque showing a lion-human creature.They believe the arrangement of the marks, in particular the dots on the back, show the patterns acted as communication.The researchers believe that Stone Age people deliberately carved these symbols to communicate messages, meaning, and convey thoughts.Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Vorderasiatisches Museum / Olaf M. TesmerA proto-cuneiform tablet from around 3350 years ago \"Our results also show that the hunter-gatherers of the Paleolithic era developed a symbol system with a statistically comparable information density to the earliest proto-cuneiform tablets from ancient Mesopotamia – a full 40,000 years later,\" says Bentz.The clue to finding meaning is in the density of the symbols. They found high repetition of the signs and predictability in the subsequent symbols that is \"comparable to much later proto-cuneiform,\" according to Bentz.They found denser patterns on figurines than on tools.The team say that it shows that communicating information was very important for Paleolithic people.\"They were skilled craftspeople. You can tell they carried the objects with them. Many of them fit very well in the hand, just the right size to fit in the palm,\" says Dutkiewicz.The research is published in the journal PNAS.",

    "body": "42 minutes agoYvette TanGetty ImagesSince coming to power, Xi has launched waves of anti-corruption drivesChina has removed 19 officials, including nine from the military, from its list of lawmakers ahead of its biggest annual political meeting next week.The removals were announced by the country's top legislative body, the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee. No official reason for the removal has been given, but it comes just weeks after President Xi Jinping removed Zhang Youxia, his highest-ranking general and also one of his closest military allies, from his role. Since coming to power, Xi has launched waves of anti-corruption drives, calling corruption \"the biggest threat\" to the Communist Party. However, some critics say it has been used as a tool to purge political rivals.According to a report by state media outlets, those removed include Li Qiaoming, commander of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Ground Force and Shen Jinlong, a former PLA Navy commander. Also on the list were several other military officers and a number of provincial officials including Sun Shaochong, the former party chief of the Inner Mongolia region. It comes just weeks after Zhang was removed from his post, after he was accused of \"serious violations of discipline and law\" - typically a euphemism for corruption.But it is also the latest in a series of purges of high-profile figures in the military over the last few years, including a October 2025 crackdown which saw nine top generals removed from their posts. Authorities at the time said the purges were part of an anti-corruption drive. Xi has made the fight against corruption a central pillar of his rule beginning with his \"tigers and flies\" anti-corruption drive targeting both high-level and low-level officials, launched shortly after he took power in 2013. He has said recently that the battle \"remains grave and complex\".Thousands of delegates are due to descend on the capital Beijing next week for the Two Sessions. These are- the annual meetings of the NPC, which is China's legislature, and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference which is the country's top political advisory body.The Two Sessions will run from March 4 to 11 and will see the government announce its five year plan, where it outlines its key policy objectives, and its annual economic targets.

    "body": "53 minutes agoBrandon DrenonGettyThe FBI has fired roughly 10 members, all of whom participated in a probe into Donald Trump's handling of classified documents after his first term.Their termination on Wednesday, confirmed by the BBC's US partner CBS, was announced shortly after FBI director Kash Patel told Reuters that federal agents subpoenaed his phone records when he was a private citizen during the documents investigation. Susie Wiles, now White House chief of staff, also had her phone records subpoenaed  when she was a private citizen as part of the investigation.Patel did not offer any evidence of wrongdoing by the FBI employees who were fired.After Trump left the White House in 2021, Special Counsel Jack Smith led two federal investigations into now-President Trump. One case was focused on whether Trump tried to overturn the 2020 election results. The other involved classified documents Trump brought back to his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida and his alleged efforts to obstruct the US Department of Justice from later retrieving them. The FBI staffers who were terminated on Wednesday all participated in the classified documents case.The BBC has reached out to the FBI for comment. An advocacy group representing current and former FBI employees condemned the firings. \"These actions weaken the Bureau by stripping away critical expertise and destabilizing the workforce, undermining trust in leadership and jeopardizing the Bureau's ability to meet its recruitment goals - ultimately putting the nation at greater risk,\" the FBI Agents Association said in a statement. Trump and two of his associates were indicted in 2023, following Smith's investigation into the classified documents.In 2024, a federal judge in Florida dropped the case against Trump, however, having found that Smith was unlawfully appointed. This year, a federal appeals court in Georgia dropped the case against the last two defendants at the request of Trump's justice department.Since Trump returned to the White House in January, the justice department and FBI have fired employees who participated in the federal investigations against him.The justice department also attempted to pursue charges against former FBI director James Comey, whom Trump fired during his first term in 2017, and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led a civil fraud lawsuit against Trump.",

    "body": "15 hours agoBen HattonReutersThe president and CEO of the World Economic Forum (WEF), Borge Brende, has resigned after a review into his links to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The forum ordered an independent review into Brende over his ties to the disgraced financier following the release of Epstein files by the US Department of Justice.Brende has acknowledged he dined with Epstein three times between 2018 and 2019 and communicated with him by email and text, but said he was \"completely unaware\" of his past criminal activity.The WEF said a review into his links to Epstein found \"there were no additional concerns beyond what has been previously disclosed\".Brende, a former Norwegian foreign minister, has also said he regretted not having investigated Epstein more thoroughly.The WEF holds an annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, which attracts political and business leaders from across the world.In a statement on Thursday, Brende said he had decided to step down after more than eight years in the role following \"careful consideration\". \"I believe now is the right moment for the Forum to continue its important work without distractions,\" he said.Epstein was convicted for soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008, for which he was registered as a sex offender.Being named in the Epstein files does not indicate criminality and Brende has not been accused of wrongdoing.WEF co-chairs Andre Hoffmann and Larry Fink thanked Brende for his \"significant contributions\" and said they respected his decision.Alois Zwinggi will serve as interim president and CEO while the organisation's board of trustees oversees a process to identify a permanent successor, the WEF said. Zwinggi had been a managing director on the WEF's executive body. A number of politicians, celebrities, business leaders and royals from across the world have faced scrutiny over their links to Epstein following the release of the latest tranche of files linked to US investigations into Epstein. The files contain millions of private emails, images and FBI reports into Epstein, who died in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking.Former Norwegian Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland was charged with \"gross corruption\" earlier this month over his ties with Epstein, police said.",

The party's co-leader Alice Weidel said the verdict was \"a major victory not only for the AfD but also for democracy and the rule of law\".The AfD came second in federal elections in Germany last year, winning a record 152 seats in the 630-seat parliament with 20.8% of the vote.A designation as an extremist group gives authorities greater surveillance powers and, in fact, the AfD had already been placed under observation for suspected extremism in Germany. The intelligence agency had also classed it as right-wing extremist in three states in the east, where its popularity is highest.The AfD challenged the label in Cologne - where the BfV is based - which is why Thursday's decision was issued by the city's administrative court.It did not say when its final ruling would be issued.As part of its role in ensuring Germany's \"free democratic basic order\", the domestic intelligence agency is responsible for both counter-intelligence and investigating terror threats. Germany's Constitutional Court has banned only two parties since the end of World War Two, both in the 1950s.",

The past few months of Danish politics have been dominated by US President Donald Trump's threats to annex Greenland - a semi-autonomous Danish territory. Last month, Trump dropped threats to use force against the fellow Nato ally to seize the Arctic island he argues is necessary to defend against possible attacks from Russia and China.Announcing the decision to call early elections on 24 March, Prime Minister Frederiksen told parliament that security \"is and will remain the very foundation of Danish politics for many, many years to come\". \"We must rearm to ensure peace on our continent,\" she said. \"We must stick together in Europe, and we must secure the future of the Danish Commonwealth\" - Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands.\"Whether I will continue to be your prime minister depends on how strong a mandate you give the Social Democrats,\" Frederiksen said mentioning her party, the lead partner in the current Danish coalition. Trump has claimed without evidence that it is \"covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place\". More than 100 US military personnel are permanently stationed at a US base in Greenland's north-western tip - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two.Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.But Trump has not abandoned his plans - he has said previously that the US needs to own Greenland to properly defend it - and talks continue over ways of establishing US control over the entire island. Both Denmark and Greenland have said they will not agree to cede sovereignty to the US. Their European allies have rallied to their support.The latest confrontation may come in the next few days if Trump follows through with an announcement that the US plans to send a boat filled with medical supplies to Greenland, alleging \"many people\" on the island are sick and \"not being taken care of\". Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen rejected the proposal, telling Trump that Greenland provides free healthcare for all citizens, unlike the US.",

Residents in Kabul heard loud blasts across the city on Friday, AFP reported.Both sides claim to have inflicted heavy losses on each other during recent clashes. People in Pakistan's border regions told the BBC they had heard explosions and were asked to move to safety.Pakistan earlier said that two of its soldiers have been killed after the Afghan Taliban launched an operation against military positions along their shared border late on Thursday.Three others were injured as Pakistani forces responded to the \"unprovoked fire\", Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said.The Afghan Taliban said it had launched the \"large-scale\" operation in response to strikes earlier this week, which it claimed had killed at least 18 people. Islamabad said it had targeted alleged militant camps and hideouts.Taliban military spokesman Mawlawi Wahidullah Mohammadi said the \"retaliatory operation\" had been launched at around 20:00 local time (15:30 GMT) on Thursday.The group's chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the offensive had killed \"numerous\" Pakistani soldiers and captured others.This was denied by a spokesman for Pakistan's prime minister, who also contested Mujahid's claim that 15 military posts had been captured.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's spokesman Mosharraf Zaidi dismissed claims of damage on the Pakistani side and said all aggression would receive an \"immediate and effective\" response.Mujahid wrote on X that \"in response to repeated border violations and insurgency by Pakistani military circles, large-scale preemptive operations were launched against Pakistani army centres and military installations\" along the border.Pakistan's government said the Taliban had \"miscalculated and opened unprovoked fire on multiple locations\" across the border in its north-western province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which had been met with an \"immediate and effective response\" by Islamabad's security forces.\"Early reports confirm heavy casualties on [the] Afghan side with multiple posts and equipment destroyed,\" said a Ministry of Information & Broadcasting statement shared on X.\"Pakistan will take all necessary measures to ensure its territorial integrity and the safety and security of its citizens.\"Residents reported hearing a heavy exchange of fire along the border. Those living near Pakistan's border town of Torkham were asked to vacate the area. Officials suspended the repatriation of deported Afghan nationals back over the border in the town due to the clashes. The crossing was also closed to Afghan refugees.Islamabad had said it targeted seven alleged militant camps and hideouts near the border and that they had been launched after recent suicide bombings in Pakistan.Kabul meanwhile said civilian homes and a religious school had been targeted, with women and children among the dead.Pakistan and Afghanistan share a 1,600-mile (2,574 km) mountainous border.",

    "body": "5 hours agoMaia DaviesandChris GrahamWatch: \"I'm not going to speculate\", says Marco Rubio on Cuba boat shootingAt least one American citizen was shot dead and another injured by Cuban officials intercepting a speedboat off its coast on Wednesday, a US official has said.Border guards shot dead four people and injured the remaining six aboard the Florida-registered speedboat. Cuba accused the 10 people on the boat of planning \"an infiltration with terrorist aims\" and said they opened fire first.A third person was on a US K-1 visa - for fiancées of American citizens - the US official said. The boat's owner alleged the vessel had been stolen by an employee.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had said Washington was investigating the \"highly unusual\" incident.Cuban authorities had said all 10 were Cuban nationals residing in the US.They also identified an 11th person they said had been arrested and had confessed to being part of the alleged plot.The interior ministry said earlier that the speedboat had entered its territorial waters and was \"one nautical mile off Cayo Falcones\" on the country's northern coast when it was intercepted.It said the commander of the Cuban boat was injured in the firefight that ensued.The Cuban authorities added that most of the passengers on the US-registered boat had \"prior records involving criminal and violent activity\".Handguns, assault rifles and improvised explosive devices were recovered from the speedboat, along with other tactical gear, according to the statement.The deadly shooting comes at a time of increased tension between the two countries. Rubio has said the speedboat incident was not a US operation and no US government personnel were involved.Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel on Thursday vowed to defend the Caribbean country against aggression.\"Cuba will defend itself with determination and firmness against any terrorist and mercenary aggression that seeks to affect its sovereignty and national stability,\" Díaz-Canel said on X.\"Cuba does not attack, nor threaten,\" Díaz-Canel added.Cuba's deputy foreign minister Carlos Fernández de Cossío said the US had shown a \"willingness\" to cooperate on \"clarifying these regrettable events\".BBC Verify checked the speedboat's registration details provided by the Cuban embassy in the US (FL7726SH, Florida registered), but they yielded no ownership details or tracking history on any of the platforms the BBC relies on.ReutersRubio has said it was not a US operation and no US government personnel were involvedCuba's interior ministry has in the past denounced other incursions into its territorial waters by privately owned US boats it said were engaged in smuggling Cubans from the Caribbean island to the US.The incident also comes almost 30 years to the day since Cuban defence forces shot down two small civilian planes belonging to Brothers to the Rescue, a US-based group that searched for rafts carrying migrants from Cuba to the US.Four people aboard were killed in the 1996 incident, triggering outrage in the US.Last month, following the seizure of Venezuela's Maduro in a US military operation, US President Donald Trump told Cuba to \"make a deal\" or face unspecified consequences.The move has further exacerbated the already crippling oil and fuel shortages Cuba has been suffering for years.On Wednesday, however, the US Treasury said it would ease some small private sector transactions, including oil sales, to \"support the Cuban people, for commercial and humanitarian use\".",

    "body": "11 hours agoWedaeli ChibelushiKenya's Office of The Director of ProsecutionsFestus Arasa Omwamba was arrested earlier this month near the Ethiopian borderPolice in Kenya have charged a man accused of luring young men to Russia with job opportunities, only for them to end up fighting in Ukraine.Festus Arasa Omwamba, head of recruitment agency Global Faces Human Resources, recruited 22 Kenyans \"for the purpose of exploitation by means of deception\", state prosecutors said on Thursday.The victims were rescued last September from an apartment complex in Athi River, a town near the capital, Nairobi, before they could travel to Russia.However, three others had already left Kenya, finding themselves on the front line of the war and returning home with injuries, the prosecutors added. Omwamba, aged 33, pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.A total of 1,000 Kenyans have been recruited to fight for Russia in its four-year war against Ukraine, a report from Kenya's National Intelligence Service (NIS), released last week, said.Presenting the report to MPs, parliament majority leader Kimani Ichung'wah, described a \"deeply disturbing\" network of rogue state officials allegedly colluding with human trafficking syndicates to recruit and transport Kenyans.Omwamba was arrested earlier this month in a town near the Ethiopian border after surrendering to police.Victims rescued from the Athi Rivers complex last September revealed they had signed contracts with an unnamed overseas employment agency, committing to pay up to $18,000 (£13,000) for visas, travel, accommodation, and other logistics, the police said.The National Intelligence Service said that upon arrival in Russia, many Kenyans reportedly find themselves deployed to front-line combat roles after minimal military training.Earlier this month, the government of the East African country said it would urge Russia to ban the recruitment of Kenyans to fight in Ukraine.The Russian embassy in Nairobi has denied encouraging Kenyans to fight in Ukraine, or issuing visas \"to Kenyan citizens who sought to travel to Russia with the stated pose of participating in the Special Military Operation (SMO) in Ukraine\".The embassy added that while it does not recruit foreigners, Russian law allows foreign nationals who are legally in Russia to voluntarily enlist in their armed forces.Ukraine's foreign minister said on Wednesday that more than 1,700 people from 36 countries in Africa had been recruited to fight for Russia.South Africa on Thursday said that two of its citizens had been killed in Ukraine, while another 15 had been repatriated over the past week. Two more remain in Russia getting treatment for \"very severe\" injuries, said Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola.Ukrainian officials have repeatedly warned that anyone fighting for Russia will be treated as an enemy combatant, and that the only safe route out is to surrender and be treated as a prisoner of war.However, Ukraine itself has previously come in for criticism for trying to recruit foreign nationals, including Africans, to fight on its side.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Russia and Ukraine exchange more than 1,000 soldiers' bodies15 hours agoPaulin KolaMedinski Instagram postThe peace talks have not produced any results, but prisoners and bodies have been exchangedRussia says it has handed over the remains of 1,000 soldiers to Ukraine and has received the bodies of 35 Russian soldiers in return.It comes as Ukraine's chief negotiator met US President Donald Trump's envoys in Geneva to discuss economic plans for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war.Negotiators were also preparing a third round of US-led talks aimed at ending the conflict which has entered its fifth year - a trilateral meeting involving the Russian side, too. Hours before the Geneva talks, Russia launched 420 drones and 39 missiles in six different regions of Ukraine, injuring dozens of people, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said.Vladimir Medinsky, a top aide of Russian President Vladimir Putin, announced the exchange of bodies in a short announcement on Telegram. He gave no details, but included an image showing bodies being unloaded from a truck. Hours later, Ukraine said it had received 1,000 bodies which, \"according to prior information from the Russian side, may belong to Ukrainian defenders\".The two sides have exchanged thousands of soldiers' bodies over the course of the conflict that began with Putin's decision to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. The exchange is based on an agreement reached by the two sides during negotiations in Istanbul in June 2025. Moscow and Kyiv agreed to return the bodies of up to 6,000 soldiers each, as well as all sick and heavily wounded prisoners of war and those aged under 25.Kyiv and Moscow regularly publish estimates of the other side's losses, but do not detail their own.And from public sources, the BBC has confirmed the names of almost 186,000 people killed fighting on Russia's side in Ukraine. The true death toll is generally accepted to be much higher, as many deaths on the battlefield are not recorded.So even though estimates suggest more Russians are dying every day, Moscow has returned more bodies to Ukraine overall than it has received. No-one has explained the discrepancy, even though Russia has previously accused Ukraine of not abiding by the Istanbul agreement, and Ukraine has alleged Russian body returns were irregular and sometimes included Russians' remains - a charge Moscow has rejected.One possible explanation is that Russia captures more Ukrainian bodies given its troops have been on the attack most of the time and, therefore, more able to retrieve them from the battlefield.On the eve of the Geneva talks, President Zelensky had a telephone conversation with Trump and said he expected the Geneva meeting would lead to trilateral negotiations at the beginning of March - thus creating \"an opportunity to move talks to the leaders' level\". \"President Trump supports this sequence of steps,\" Zelensky said, adding: \"This is the only way to resolve all the complex and sensitive issues and finally end the war.\" Putin, for his part, has refused to meet Zelensky, describing him as illegitimate - an argument centring on the fact that no presidential election has been held in Ukraine, despite the expiry of Zelensky's term in March 2024.However, Ukraine's constitution bars holding elections under martial law - imposed in the wake of Putin's invasion of his neighbour.",

    "body": "Girl, 14, shot dead as South Africa's 'taxi wars' hit school15 hours agoWycliffe MuiaGeach/Gallo Images via Getty Images)South Africa's competitive and lucrative taxi industry has been plagued by violence for years Police in South Africa are investigating a fatal shooting at a secondary school in the coastal city of Cape Town that killed a 14-year-old pupil and a taxi operator.An unidentified man opened fire on a taxi as the driver waited to pick up pupils on Wednesday, shooting the driver, another man and two children, police said. Two pupils, aged 14 and 16, were also injured in the attack, which has been linked to long-running deadly turf wars between rival taxi associations. \"It is unacceptable that our children continue to be exposed to danger as a result of ongoing conflict within the taxi industry,\" said Isaac Sileku, a senior Western Cape official. Violence has plagued South Africa's highly competitive and lucrative taxi industry for decades.While minibus taxis continue to dominate the market, the rise of e-hailing services is increasing tensions, leading to violent and sometimes deadly clashes between operators.On Thursday, Cape Town Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis said the local authority was offering a reward of up to 100,000 rand (£4,600; $6,400) for information that leads to the arrest and prosecution of those responsible for the shooting.Wednesday's attack took place as students at Atlantis Senior Secondary were leaving school, when gunshots rang out and sparked panic.Police arrived at the scene and found a minibus taxi parked outside the school, with the body of a 42-year-old a taxi operator inside. He had multiple gunshot wounds.In the school grounds, officers discovered the body of a 14-year-old girl who had been shot multiple times in the chest. Police said she had been shot while attempting to run from the gunfire.\"A 14-year-old learner [female] sustained a gunshot wound to her back. Another 16-year-old female was grazed by a bullet,\" said police spokesperson FC van Wyk.He said it was not yet clear how many gunmen were involved, adding that detectives and officers from the Taxi Violence Investigations Unit were investigating the attack.This was the second attempt on the taxi operator's life this month, local media reported.In a statement, the Western Cape regional authorities condemned the \"senseless act\", saying \"no learner should ever face danger while travelling to or from school\". \"Violence of this nature undermines community safety, disrupts education, and instils fear among residents,\" it added. Sileku said the safety of commuters and learners \"is non-negotiable and must never be compromised by [taxi] industry conflict\". \"We also urge law enforcement agencies to act decisively to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice swiftly.\"More about South Africa from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "16 hours agoNardine SaadLos AngelesGetty ImagesD4vd has not been charged or officially named as a suspect in the caseNewly unsealed court filings have revealed that US singer D4vd - real name David Anthony Burke - is the target of a grand jury investigation into the apparent murder of a 14-year-old girl, whose remains were found in his car in September.The filings were released after D4vd's family were summoned by a California court to testify before the grand jury.Dawud Burke, D4vd's father, fought against the summons in a Texas court, and in doing so included portions of material from the California case that had not been previously available to the public.The filings confirm that D4vd has been identified as a \"target\" of a grand jury investigation in Los Angeles and that he may be subject to proceedings for one count of murder.He has not been charged or officially named as a suspect in the case and an indictment has not been announced. Grand jury proceedings remain ongoing, according to US media. D4vd has not commented on the case, but his representatives previously said he was cooperating with police.A lawyer for the singer did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.Warning - this story contains content that some may find distressingThe unsealed court filings mark the latest chapter in a case which has been dissected by internet sleuths for months.On 8 September 2025, investigators found the decomposed head and torso of 14-year-old Celeste Rivas Hernandez in a cadaver bag in the front boot of a Tesla car registered to D4vd's address in Texas, the court documents said.When they removed the bag, they discovered severed arms and legs in a black bag, the documents said.D4vd - who released his debut album in April - was on tour when the remains were discovered.Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesCeleste Rivas Hernandez, of Lake Elsinore, California, was reported missing before she was found dead and dismemberedPolice had previously said that they discovered Rivas Hernandez's remains inside the boot of the impounded car after responding to reports of a foul odour at the Hollywood tow yard.Rivas Hernandez, from Lake Elsinore in California, had been missing and was last seen in April 2024, according to a missing person flyer cited by CBS, the BBC's US news partner. The decomposition of her body indicated that she had already been \"deceased for several weeks\", investigators have said.A police spokesperson previously said that the case was being investigated by its robbery-homicide division.As the grand jury proceedings got under way last year, the court filings said that prosecutors believed the testimony of D4vd's family was \"material and necessary\" to the investigation. But Dawud Burke, along with his wife Colleen and son Caleb, have argued that the summons violates their right to due process because the notice they received from the California court contained redacted information, according to Texas court transcripts included in the filings.\"The Court ordered Mr. Burke to travel across the country to appear before a California grand jury without ever allowing him to see the full documents that justified the extraordinary compulsion,\" Dawud Burke's attorney said in the filing.He challenged the California court's out-of-state subpoena, which he believed was compelling him to travel against his will.Los Angeles Police Department detectives travelled to Texas to bring the singer's family to California to appear before the grand jury, whose proceedings are secret, court records said.The related documents have provided the biggest tranche of information about the case thus far, delineating key details in the ongoing investigation, which has been shrouded in secrecy.In November, the Los Angeles County medical examiner's office said it received a court order imposing a security hold on the case, and that no details about Rivas Hernandez's death could be released or posted on its website.The police department said it requested the order to ensure officers \"receive information from the Medical Examiner before the public\".Chief Medical Examiner Dr Odey Ukpo said the practice of security holds is \"virtually unheard of in other counties\" and \"has not been proven to improve outcomes in the legal system\".The Los Angeles District Attorney's Office declined to comment when contacted by the BBC.",

    "body": "6 hours agoKathryn Armstrong and David GrittenIsrael has confirmed Hamas handed over the remains of deceased Tanzanian hostage Joshua Mollel on Wednesday under the US-brokered Gaza ceasefire deal.The Israeli prime minister's office said that, following the completion of forensic tests at the National Centre of Forensic Medicine, the foreign ministry had informed the 21-year-old student's family.Mollel was undertaking an agricultural internship in southern Israel when Hamas-led gunmen attacked on 7 October 2023. He was killed at Kibbutz Nahal Oz and his body was then taken by fighters.His return means six deceased hostages - five Israelis and one Thai - are still in Gaza.\"The government of Israel shares in the deep sorrow of the Mollel family and all the families of the fallen hostages,\" the Israeli prime minister's office said in a statement on Thursday.It also stressed that Hamas was required to return all the deceased hostages under the ceasefire deal, adding that Israeli authorities would \"spare no effort until we return all of the fallen hostages, every last one of them.\"The Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel said: \"Amid their grief and the knowledge that their hearts will never fully heal, Joshua's return offers some comfort to a family that has endured unbearable uncertainty for over two years.\"Before handing over Mollel's remains to the Red Cross in Gaza on Wednesday evening, Hamas's military wing said that it had recovered a hostage's body in the eastern Shejaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City.In recent days, Israel has allowed members of Hamas and Red Cross staff to search for remains in the area, which is inside territory still controlled by Israeli forces.The body of Israel-US soldier Staff Sgt Itay Chen was found there on Tuesday.Under the first phase of the ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages it was holding within 72 hours.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has handed over the bodies of 285 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 19 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas, along with those of three foreign hostages - one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.Five of the six dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis and one is Thai.Israel has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the bodies, while Hamas has insisted it is struggling to find them under rubble.The slow progress has meant there has been no advance on the second phase of President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan. This includes plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas, and reconstruction.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the 7 October 2023 attack, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "German nurse gets life in jail after murdering 10 to reduce workload14 hours agoTabby WilsonGetty ImagesA palliative care nurse in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison after he was convicted of the murder of 10 patients and the attempted murder of 27 others.Prosecutors alleged that the man, who has not been publicly named, injected his mostly elderly patients with painkillers or sedatives in an effort to ease his workload during shifts overnight.The offences were committed between December 2023 and May 2024 in a hospital in Wuerselen, in western Germany. Investigators are reported to be looking into several other suspicious cases during his career.According to media outlet Agence France-Presse (AFP), the unnamed man had been employed at the hospital in Wuerselen since 2020, after completing training as a nursing professional in 2007. Prosecutors told a court in Aachen that he showed \"irritation\" and a lack of empathy to patients who required a higher level of care, and accused him of playing \"master of life and death\". The court was told that he injected patients with large doses of morphine and midazolam, a type of sedative, in an effort to reduce his workload during night shifts.He was arrested in 2024.When issuing the life sentence, the court said that the man's crimes carried a \"particular severity of guilt\" which should bar him from early release after 15 years.He will be able to appeal the verdict.Prosecutors have told AFP that exhumations are taking place to identify further potential victims, which could see the man put on trial again.The case bears similarity to that of former nurse Niels Högel, who was handed a life sentence in 2019 after he was convicted of murdering 85 patients at two hospitals in northern Germany. A court found that he administered lethal doses of heart medication to people in his care between 1999 and 2005.He is believed to be the most prolific killer in Germany's modern history.",

    "body": "4 hours agoBethany Bell,Vienna and Yogita Limaye,South Asia and Afghanistan correspondentOpium farming in Afghanistan has dropped significantly following a ban imposed by the Taliban government in 2022, the United Nations said.The total area of land for growing opium poppy shrank 20% since last year, while the amount of opium has fallen by 32% over the same period, the UN's Office on Drugs and Crime said in a survey.Afghanistan used to produce more than 80% of the world's opium, with heroin made from Afghan opium making up 95% of the market in Europe.But after retaking power the Taliban banned the practice in April 2022, saying opium was harmful and went against their religious beliefs. The UN said most farmers continued to observe the ban despite \"severe economic challenges\".Many Afghan farmers are harvesting cereals, but poppy - from which opium, the key ingredient for the drug heroin can be extracted - continues to be \"far more profitable\" than legitimate crops, the UNODC noted.Over 40% of available farmland has remained fallow because of the lack of profitable alternatives, limited agricultural outputs and, adverse climate conditions it added.The total area under opium poppy cultivation this year was estimated at 10,200 hectares, mostly in the north-east of the country, with Badakhshan province accounting for the largest share. Before the 2022 ban, more than 200,000 hectares were under poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. Four provinces with opium poppy cultivation in 2024 (Balkh, Farah, Laghman, Uruzgan) were declared opium poppy-free in 2025. \"The near elimination of cultivation from traditional strongholds illustrates the scale and durability of the ban on opium poppy cultivation,\" the survey said.The Taliban's efforts to destroy opium fields occasionally sparked violent resistance from the farmers, particularly in the north-east, the UNODC said, noting that casualties were reported during clashes in several districts of Badakhshan.But the vast majority of Afghan farmers adhere to the ban issued by the Taliban's supreme leader. However, farmers say they lack support to grow alternative crops - as a result, they have to choose between poverty or punishment.\"If we violate the ban, we face prison. If we comply, we face destitution,\" one unnamed farmer in Helmand province told BBC Pashto this summer.\"If there's no money, then I'll grow poppies again.\"Poppy fields are no longer openly visible in Helmand, but they do still exist.Another farmer showed BBC Pashto around his small walled-off poppy field in front of his house in a remote village. He's risking jail, but he said he had no option.\"What should I do? I'm forced to do this - I have nothing else. I can't even provide food for my family.\"While opium is in decline, trafficking in synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine have risen since the ban, the UNODC said. Seizures of such drugs in and around Afghanistan was 50% higher in late 2024 compared with the previous year. Organised crime groups favour synthetic drugs which are easier to produce and less vulnerable to climate shocks, the UNODC said.",

    "body": "38 minutes agoLily Jamali,in San Francisco and Aoife Walsh,in WashingtonNancy Pelosi has announced her retirement from Congress, ending a decades-long career that saw the California Democrat become one of the most powerful figures in US politics.In a video message on Thursday, Pelosi said she will not be seeking re-election to Congress at the end of her term in January 2027.It marks the end of a storied political career: Pelosi, 85, became the first woman to serve as Speaker of the House and led her party in the lower chamber of Congress from 2003 until 2023.\"We have made history, we have made progress,\" Pelosi said in her message. \"We have always led the way, and now we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our democracy, and fighting for the American ideals we hold dear.\"\"As we go forward, my message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power,\" Pelosi added.Pelosi was first elected to Congress to represent San Francisco in 1987 aged 47, and quickly rose through the ranks. She was elected by her party to be speaker of the House in 2007, becoming the first woman to serve in that role. She served until 2011, when Democrats lost control of the lower chamber, before returning to the speaker's chair from 2019 to 2023.Speaker of the House is the one congressional job detailed in the US Constitution. After the vice-president, it is next in line to the presidency.In that role, Pelosi played a critical role in advancing - or thwarting - the agendas of multiple presidents during her long career on Capitol Hill.She is widely credited with marshalling the passage of former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare legislation, as well as bills to address infrastructure and climate change during Joe Biden's presidency.Pelosi also directly challenged Donald Trump throughout his presidency, famously ripping up a copy of his State of the Union address behind his back.By then she was also a lightning rod for Republican anger - in their eyes, representing the coastal elites pushing a big-spending, radical platform.She led two impeachment efforts against Trump - the first in 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine. Trump was accused of pressing Ukraine to dig up damaging information on Biden, and of using military aid as leverage. He was later acquitted in the Republican-controlled Senate.The second was in 2021, when he was accused by the House of inciting the storming of the Capitol - the seat of the US Congress - with a speech on 6 January to supporters outside the White House. That effort ultimately failed and Trump was acquitted once again.Later, Pelosi worked with Biden to shepherd much of his legislative agenda through her chamber despite the razor-thin margins.In less than two years, Democrats in the House pushed through a Covid relief bill, a bipartisan infrastructure spending package, a multi-trillion-dollar environment and social spending programme, and legislation protecting gay marriage.She was succeeded as Democratic leader in the House by New York Representative Hakeem Jeffries in 2022.Since leaving her speakership, she has remained a major political influence. Most recently, she played a key role in helping to pass Proposition 50 in California -  a state redistricting effort aimed at flipping five House seats to Democrats during the midterms in 2026.",

    "body": "19 hours agoWill GrantCentral America and Cuba correspondentMexico President Claudia Sheinbaum has said she will press charges against a man who groped her during a public appearance.Mobile phone footage of the incident on Tuesday shows Sheinbaum speaking to a group of supporters on a street near the National Palace in Mexico City. In the video, a man approaches her from behind and attempts to kiss her on the neck and place his hands on her body. Sheinbaum moved away quickly and a member of her team stepped in, but she was visibly shaken. The offender has been arrested.\"My view is, if I don't file a complaint, what will happen to other Mexican women? If they do this to the president, what will happen to all women in our country?\" Sheinbaum said at a news conference on Wednesday.\"I decided to press charges because this is something that I experienced as a woman, but that we as women experience in our country,\" she said. \"I have experienced it before, when I wasn't president, when I was a student.\"She added that she had decided to press ahead with bringing charges against the suspect as he had allegedly harassed other women in the crowd.\"A line must be drawn,\" she said.Women's rights groups and feminist commentators have said the incident shows the extent of ingrained machismo in Mexican society, where a man believes he has the right to accost even the president if she is a woman. Femicide is also a huge problem in Mexico, with a staggering 98% of gender-based murders estimated to go unpunished.Sheinbaum promised to tackle the issue as a candidate, but so far in her administration there has been no discernible improvement in that area of violent crime.The incident also comes amid discussions about presidential security and the wider safety of politicians.As president, Sheinbaum has broadly followed the approach of her predecessor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, in having close and regular contact with her supporters on the streets or in campaign events. On occasion, that has presented security concerns for her team. However, she confirmed in her new conference she had no intention of changing her policy of interacting with her supporters.The incident also happened just days after the murder of Carlos Manzo, the mayor of Uruapan, a municipality in the violent state of Michoacan, at the local Day of the Dead celebrations.Manzo had called on Sheinbaum for greater federal support in Uruapan in the fight against drug cartels. Around 35 candidates were killed in the lead up to the general election last year in what was considered the bloodiest campaign in modern Mexico.Since taking office, Sheinbaum has made in-roads in improving the country's dire security situation, particularly clamping down on fentanyl-trafficking – a key issue for her US counterpart, President Trump.",

    "body": "20 hours agoAnbarasan EthirajanGlobal News ReporterItaly says seven of its citizens are missing in Nepal after trying to climb a Himalayan peak in the north-east of the country.Officials said the Italian team was at the base camp of Dolma Khang peak, which has an elevation of 6,332m (20,774ft), in Dolakha district.Three other Italian climbers have been confirmed dead this week, including in an avalanche that struck close to Dolma Khang on Monday. A senior Italian diplomat from neighbouring India has arrived in Kathmandu to coordinate with the Nepalese authorities and search teams.Nepal has been hit by avalanches and ferocious storms in the past week, killing and injuring a number of climbers and their local guides.\"At this stage, the local authorities have confirmed the deaths of three Italian climbers,\" Rome's foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. \"There remains no news of seven other Italian nationals, including Marco Di Marcello and Markus Kircheler.\"The foreign ministry said both Mr Marcello and Mr Kircheler were in the Yalung Ri area, where Monday's avalanche struck. Italian Paolo Cocco was among seven climbers who were already confirmed to have died near the Yalung Ri base camp. On Tuesday, Mr Marcello's family told Italy's Ansa news agency that his satellite radio signal was continuing to update and appeared to be moving. A Nepali tourism official, Ram Krishna Lamichhane, told the BBC they had been in contact with rescue teams searching the base camp at Dolma Khang peak, which was hit by an avalanche.\"According to the information we have, five people, including three foreign climbers and two Nepali guides, are missing in the Dolma Khang base camp area,\" Mr Lamichhane said.There have been conflicting reports about the number of dead and missing climbers in the area in recent days, as well as their nationalities. Mr Lamichhane added that they were also coordinating with the trekking agency that had organised their expedition to Dolma Khang to find out more details on the missing.As well as Paolo Cocco, the bodies of two other Italian climbers who went missing while attempting to scale the Panbari peak in western Nepal have also been recovered. Stefano Farronato and Alessandro Caputo were part of a three-man group that became stranded along with three local guides last week.The group had been granted permission to climb the 6,887m peak, but were reported missing when they lost contact with the base camp following heavy snowfall on 28 October.The third member of the group, another Italian man, was rescued along with one sherpa.Autumn is a popular season for trekkers and mountaineers in Nepal as weather conditions and visibility have tended to be better. However, the risk of severe weather and avalanches remains.Last week, Cyclone Montha triggered heavy rain and snowfall across Nepal, stranding people in the Himalayas.",

    "body": "7 hours agoMeryl Sebastian & Devina Gupta,BBC News and Abhishek Dey,BBC News, DelhiElection Commission of IndiaVoters are casting their ballots for 243 seats in a two-phase election to choose the next state governmentBrisk voting is being reported in the eastern Indian state of Bihar where more than 74 million people are eligible to vote in a crucial election that will be a precursor to several key state polls.Voters are casting their ballots for 243 seats in a two-phase election to choose the next state government. Counting of votes is scheduled for 14 November.The election comes after a controversial revision of electoral rolls that the opposition alleged would exclude genuine voters and give an edge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The BJP and India's Election Commission have denied these allegations.Long queues were witnessed through the day outside the polling stations in all the 18 districts where voting was being held on Thursday. The second and final day of voting would be 11 November.In hundreds of polling booths, people could be seen arriving in electric three-wheelers arranged by the district administration, especially for the elderly and persons with disabilities.In Alipur district, a 70-year-old woman was carried on a cot to a polling centre by her family members. When reporters asked her for comments, she could hardly speak. Her relatives said she was unwell but still wanted to make sure that her vote counted.Some polling stations were decorated with balloons and makeshift tents were arranged outside for voters to rest while they waited for their turn.At many centres in Siwan, Darbhaga and Begusarai districts, voters could be seen clicking photos at selfie points set up by the local booth officials.At 16:00 local time [07:30GMT], the voter turnout was recorded by the Election Commission at 53.77%.Election Commission of IndiaLong queues were seen outside most polling stations on ThursdayBihar is one of India's poorest and most populous states, which sees millions migrating to other states for jobs. It is also among the few states in India where Modi's party has not managed to form a government yet on its own.The outgoing government is an alliance between the BJP and the Janata Dal (United), or JD(U). They are contesting the elections again together while India's main opposition Congress party has tied up with the regional Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and a number of smaller parties.The election has also seen the entry of a new political party led by Prashant Kishor, a former political consultant who has in the past worked with both the BJP and the Congress.The election is also being closely watched as it might be the last to see active participation from two leaders who have shaped Bihar's politics for almost four decades - JD(U)'s Nitish Kumar and RJD's Lalu Prasad Yadav. The rivals, who are said to be in poor health, have on occasion joined hands to stay in power.Incumbent chief minister Kumar is one of the state's most influential leaders and has led the government for a major part of the past two decades.He is a key ally of the BJP and played a crucial role in helping Modi's party form the federal government after the 2024 election. Election Commission of IndiaBihar is one of India's poorest and most populous statesRJD's Lalu Yadav served as chief minister from 1990-97. Known for his colourful personality and witty one-liners, Yadav's rise as a politician who championed marginalised caste groups transformed the political landscape of the state. His party's years in power, however, became associated with misrule and corruption. He is currently out on bail after being convicted in corruption cases.Yadav's son Tejashwi has been projected as the chief minister candidate for the opposition alliance.The election comes on the back of a controversial voter list revision carried out by India's Election Commission a few months ago. The commission released a list of 74.2 million voters in September, weeding out 4.7 million names.The exercise was sharply criticised by the opposition, which accused the commission of dropping many voters - especially Muslims - to aid Modi's party. Both the BJP and the Election Commission denied this.New voters list in Indian state includes wrong photos and dead peopleAnalysts say female voters are expected to play a key role in these elections - nearly half of the voters are women and their turnout has seen a steady rise.Political analyst Santosh Singh says women in Bihar are more likely to vote over issues and that's why political parties are trying to target them with different welfare schemes. Both alliances have offered financial assistance to woo women voters.Earlier this week, the BBC met Kushboo Devi, 40, who's been campaigning for her local candidate in Masaurhi village. She says she has been trying to get everyone to come out and vote, but her focus is on women. \"Because in Bihar, wherever you see a higher voting percentage, it's usually the women who are showing up at the poll booths.\"",

    "body": "Attackers have boarded a ship off the coast of Somalia after firing machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades at the vessel, according to a UK maritime agency.Greek shipping company Latsco Marine Management confirmed the attack on a ship carrying gasoline, saying all the ship's 24 crew were \"safe and accounted for\" and \"we remain in close contact with them\".The crew have taken shelter in the ship's fortified safe room, Reuters news agency quotes an official from maritime security company Diaplous as saying. European Union naval forces operating in the area have been asked for assistance, Reuters says.The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) says the raid happened about 560 nautical miles south-east of the Somali town of Eyl. \"The Master of a vessel has reported being approached by one small craft on its stern. The small craft fired small arms and RPGs towards the vessel,\" UKMTO said in a statement.Private security firm Ambrey said the attackers were probably Somali pirates, who have been active in the region in recent days.According to Latsco, the attack on the Malta-registered vessel occurred at around 11:48 local time (08:48GMT). \"[Latsco] has activated its emergency response team and is coordinating with the relevant authorities to ensure the continued safety and welfare of the crew,\" it said.The vessel, named Hellas Aphrodite, was built in 2016, and was en route from Sikka, India, to Durban, South Africa, it saidThe attack comes amid a resurgence of piracy in the region, which had declined after peaking more than a decade ago.There were at least seven reported incidents last year, and several fishing vessels have already been seized by pirates this year, according to the International Maritime Bureau.",

    "body": "Watch: \"There will be frustration\" - Transport secretary outlines reduction in air trafficUS Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has warned that air travel capacity will be cut by up to 10% at 40 major airports over the coming days, if the government shutdown continues.The decision, which is expected to affect domestic flights only, was made because air traffic controllers had been reporting fatigue, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said at a briefing alongside Duffy.Some 1.4 million federal workers, from air traffic controllers to park wardens, are working without pay - or are on forced leave - because the US Congress has not agreed a federal funding budget.Unions say many employees are becoming ill with stress or are being forced into taking second jobs.On Wednesday, the impasse became the longest shutdown in US history.\"It is unusual,\" said FAA chief Bryan Bedford of the planned flight reductions, \"just as the shutdown is unusual, just as the fact that our controllers haven't been paid for a month is unusual\".The flight reductions will be gradual, starting at 4% of domestic flights on Friday, then rising to 5% on Saturday and 6% on Sunday, before hitting the full 10% next week, the Reuters news agency reported, citing four unnamed sources. The names of the affected airports - all high-traffic locations - would be released on Thursday, the officials said.US media including the BBC's partner CBS News reported that the list would include some of the nation's busiest hubs, including Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, Dallas/Fort Worth International, Denver International, Chicago O'Hare International and Los Angeles International. The cancellations could affect between 3,500 and 4,000 flights per day. US media also reported that international flights would not be affected.\"We are seeing pressures build in a way that we don't feel - if we allow it to go unchecked - will allow us to continue to tell the public that we operate the safest airline system in the world,\" Bedford said during Wednesday's briefing.Duffy insisted that air travel was still safe, and the decision to cancel the flights was being made to maintain safety and efficiency. If the shutdown continued and added more pressure to the system, additional restrictive measures may be required, Bedford said. In a statement, American Airlines, the second-largest carrier in North America, said it was awaiting additional information from the FAA so it could determine which flights will be scrapped, but that \"we expect the vast majority of our customers' travel will be unaffected\".A spokesperson for Southwest Airlines, another major carrier, said in a statement that the company was still evaluating how the flight restrictions would affect its services, and that it would let customers know as soon as possible. \"We continue to urge Congress to immediately resolve its impasse and restore the National Airspace System to its full capacity,\" the spokesperson added.Delta Airlines declined to comment. The BBC has also asked for comment from other major US airlines. Once government funds ran out on 1 October, most federal workers were sent home and told they would be paid once the government reopened. Those deemed essential, like controllers, though, had to keep doing their jobs without pay.Almost immediately after the shutdown started, airports began feeling the effects. Some had to ground flights for hours after air traffic controllers called out sick, while others relied on controllers from other airports.Duffy warned earlier this week that the flight cancellations could be coming, as half of the country's 30 major airports experienced staff shortages. Nick Daniels, the president of the labour union representing more than 20,000 aviation workers, put the situation into stark terms on Wednesday. \"Air traffic controllers are texting 'I don't even have enough money to put gas in my car to come to work,'\" he told CNN.\"We base what we do day in and day out on predictability,\" he said. \"Right now there is no predictability.\"Speaking to NPR, one controller suggested that the situation might be reaching \"tipping point\" for them and their colleagues. \"This is kind of about the point in the last shutdown where people just started getting fed up with it,\" they said.Another controller told the same broadcaster: \"It does degrade that margin of safety if a bunch of people are sick and not at work and I'm having to do their jobs along with my own.\"Writing recently for MSNBC, another controller, a single father, said he was working for food delivery service DoorDash after his daily air traffic shift ended, and was \"sleeping only two hours most nights\". \"Like many families, we didn't plan for a shutdown,\" he wrote. \"Yet the bills don't stop.\"Duffy previously said there was a risk that came with air traffic controllers taking on additional jobs during the shutdown, and had threatened to fire controllers who did not come to work.\"They have to make a decision, do I go to work and not get a paycheque and not put food on the table? Or do I drive for Uber or DoorDash or wait tables?\" Duffy said on Sunday. ",

    "body": "18 hours agoIan AikmanSeveral contestants have walked out of a Miss Universe event after an official from host nation Thailand publicly berated Miss Mexico in a tense confrontation. At a pre-pageant ceremony, Miss Universe Thailand director Nawat Itsaragrisil told off Fatima Bosch in front of dozens of contestants for failing to post promotional content.When she objected, Mr Nawat called security and threatened to disqualify those supporting her. Ms Bosch then left the room and others joined her in solidarity.Video of the incident, which was live streamed, has been shared online. The Miss Universe Organisation (MUO) has condemned Mr Nawat's \"malicious\" behaviour, for which he has since apologised.The Miss Universe contestants, who are the winners of national pageants in their home countries, attended Tuesday's event in their sashes and gowns.Some can be heard shouting back at Mr Nawat in the video, after he raises his voice to reprimand Ms Bosch and repeatedly tells her to stop talking. As many of them stand to show support, Mr Nawat says: \"If anyone wants to continue the contest, sit down. If you step out, the rest of the girls continue.\"Despite this, the majority of the women in the video appear standing, with several heading towards the door.After leaving the event on Tuesday, Ms Bosch told the press the 60-year-old executive was \"not respectful\" and said he had called her \"dumb\". Mr Nawat has disputed this, claiming his words had been misunderstood. He is widely reported to have called the 25-year-old a \"dumbhead\". But at a press conference he later claimed he was saying she had caused \"damage\".His conduct prompted a stern rebuke from the MUO, which has sent a delegation of international executives to take over running the competition.In a video statement, MUO President Raul Rocha said Mr Nawat had \"forgotten the true meaning of what it means to be a genuine host\". He said the Thai official had \"humiliated, insulted and showed a lack of respect\" to Ms Bosch, and committed the \"serious abuse of having called security to intimidate a defenceless woman\".Mr Nawat's participation in the pageant would be limited \"as much as possible\" or eliminated entirely, he said, adding the MUO would be taking \"legal actions\" against him.\"I wish to reiterate that Miss Universe is an empowerment platform for women so that their voices can be heard in the world,\" Mr Rocha said.RUNGROJ YONGRIT/EPA/ShutterstockFatima Bosch said Nawat Itsaragrisil was \"not respectful\" at the pre-pageant ceremony on TuesdayAmong those to walk out on Tuesday was reigning Miss Universe Victoria Kjaer Theilvig of Denmark. \"This is about women's rights,\" she said as she left the event. \"This is not how things should be handled. To trash another girl is beyond disrespectful... That's why I'm taking my coat and I'm walking out.\"Ms Bosch later said in an interview: \"I just want to let my country know, I'm not afraid to make my voice heard. It's here stronger than ever. I have a purpose. I have things to say.\"We're in the 21st century. I'm not a doll to be made up, styled and have my clothes changed,\" she added. \"I came here to be a voice for all the women and all the girls who fight for causes and to tell my country that I'm completely committed to that.\"Video of Mr Nawat has outraged fans of the pageant, with many heavily criticising his actions and praising Ms Bosch's response.In a social media video statement, Mr Nawat said: \"If anyone feels bad, uncomfortable, or affected, I apologise to everyone. I especially apologised to the girls who were present, around 75 of them.\"The Miss Universe competition has pressed on despite this controversy, with contestants taking part in a welcome event in Bangkok on Wednesday.The winner will be crowned the new Miss Universe on 21 November.RUNGROJ YONGRIT/EPA/ShutterstockThai businessman and media personality Nawat Itsaragrisil has apologised for the incident",

    "body": "2 hours agoHugh SchofieldIn ParisReutersThree weeks after the spectacular jewel theft at the Louvre, the museum has been heavily criticised for neglecting security.The Court of Auditors report, drawn up before the heist, found that for years managers had preferred to invest in new artworks and exhibitions rather than basic upkeep and protection.\"Let no-one be mistaken: the theft of the crown jewels is a resounding wake-up call,\" said the court's president, Pierre Moscovici.In broad daylight on Sunday 19 October, thieves broke into the Louvre's first-floor Apollo Gallery. Using a angle-grinder to open display cases, the gang made off with €88m (£78m) of jewels that once belonged to 19th-Century queens and empresses.Basing its findings on the years 2018 to 2024, the report says the Louvre \"favoured operations that were visible and attractive at the expense of maintenance and renovation of technical installations, notably in the fields of safety and security\".In the period studied, it found the museum spent €105.4m on buying new artworks and €63.5m on exhibition spaces.But at the same time it spent only €26.7m on maintenance works and €59.5m on restoration of the palace building.The findings chime with other criticisms, such as from Culture Minister Rachida Dati who said managers had \"grossly underestimated\" the dangers of intrusion into the museum.One of France's leading art experts, Didier Rykner, has also accused the museum of preferring to spend its \"abundant\" resources on eye-catching initiatives rather than basic protection of what it already has.One possible casualty is the Louvre's ambitious New Renaissance project which was launched with fanfare earlier this year by President Emmanuel Macron and the museum's director, Laurence des Cars.The plan includes a new entrance at the eastern end of the Louvre, and the excavation of new exhibition spaces including a separate gallery for the Mona Lisa.Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen A tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenBut the Court of Auditors found that the project had been \"undertaken without proper studies - either of technical and architectural feasibility (or)… financial evaluations\".The projected cost had already soared to €1.15bn, it said, compared with the €700m announced in January.In its response, the Louvre said it accepted most of the court's recommendations, but it believed the court did not fully understand all that it had done – notably in security.\"When it comes to the biggest and most visited museum on the world , the only balanced judgment is one that looks at the long term,\" it said.Meanwhile it has been revealed that one of the suspected thieves, named as Abdoulaye N, 39, was for many years considered a local hero in the Aubervilliers neighbourhood of northern Paris, renowned for his often illegal feats of motorcycling.Going by the nickname Doudou Cross Bitume, he regularly posted videos of himself performing skills on a motocross bike – such as wheelies at Paris landmarks like the Trocadero. More recently his videos showed him conducting body-building gymnastics.Abdoulaye N was previously a guard at the Center Pompidou in Paris, an arts centre containing Europe's largest museum of modern art.He had a number of convictions for traffic and other offences, but nothing linked to organised crime.  According to French media, his profile – and that of the other main suspect Ayed G – suggests they might have been petty criminals possibly in the pay of a wealthy third party.Two other people are in custody.They are a man suspected of being one of the two who waited with getaway motorbikes on the street outside the Louvre; and his wife, who faces a possible charge of conspiracy. The fourth man at the scene is still being sought – as are the jewels.According to Le Parisien newspaper, quoting investigators, Abdoulaye N and Ayed G made some surprising statements under interrogation.Abdoulaye N apparently did not realise he was breaking into the Louvre, he just thought the museum was in the area around the famous glass pyramid, while Ayed G assumed it would be empty because it was a Sunday.  In fact it was open and had plenty of visitors.Watch: Two people leave Louvre in lift mounted to vehicle",

    "body": "50 minutes agoMayeni JonesSouthern Africa correspondent, JohannesburgSouth Africa has skated over the latest criticism from US President Donald Trump, who has said he does not think the country should be part of the G20 any longer.Presidential spokesperson Vincent Magwenya told the BBC his country was confident it would host a very successful G20 summit when leaders from the world's largest economies gather in Johannesburg later this month.Trump, who has repeatedly accused South Africa of discriminating against its white minority, will not be attending - sending Vice-President JD Vance instead.Every year, a different member state holds the presidency of the G20 and sets the agenda for the leaders' summit - with the US due to take over after South Africa.\"South Africa shouldn't even be in the Gs any more, because what's happened there is bad. I'm not going to represent our country there. It shouldn't be there,\" Trump said at a conference in Miami on Wednesday.South Africa's government declined to make a full statement in response to these comments, though last week it hit back at the US's decision to prioritise refugee applications from white South African Afrikaners, who are mostly descendants of Dutch and French settlers.It said claims of a white genocide had been widely discredited and lacked reliable evidence.South Africa's latest crime statistics do not indicate that more white people have fallen victim to violent crime than other racial groups.The G20 was founded in 1999 after the Asian financial crisis. The nations involved have more than 85% of the world's wealth and its aim was to restore economic stability.The first leaders' summit was held in 2008 in response to that year's global financial turmoil, to promote international co-operation.Now the leaders get together each year - along with representatives of the European Union and African Union - to talk about the world's economies and the issues countries are facing.There is no formal procedure laid down for kicking a country out of the G20 as it is not a treaty-based organisation like the UN and does not have a legal charter or constitution. It is an informal forum that operates by consensus.\"If a country was going to be kicked out, it would basically mean that it was excluded from the meetings - it wasn't invited to the meetings by whoever was hosting the G20 that year,\" Dr Andrew Gawthorpe from UK-based think-tank the Foreign Policy Centre told the BBC.\"But the host country would be unlikely to take the decision to not invite another country unless there was agreement amongst the rest of the members to do that,\" he said. The obvious historical precedent is Russia's expulsion from what was then the G8 - a grouping of the world's most advanced economies - after the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Russia remains in the G20, which includes countries from around the world. There were calls for Russia to be expelled from the G20 after the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but in a larger grouping of countries with their own alliances, consensus couldn't be reached.This year South Africa has adopted the theme of solidarity, equality and sustainability - something the country's foreign ministry spokesperson Chrispin Phiri emphasised following Trump's criticism.\"Drawing on our own journey from racial and ethnic division to democracy, South Africa is uniquely positioned to champion within the G20 a future of genuine solidarity, where shared prosperity bridges deep inequalities,\" Mr Phiri said in a statement to the BBC.\"And collective action for sustainability that centres the development to address the impact of colonialism of the African continent.\"Trump offered refugee status to Afrikaners earlier this year after South African President Cyril Ramaphosa signed a law allowing the government to seize land without compensation in rare instances.Most private farmland is owned by white South Africans, who make up just over 7% of the population.South Africa made efforts to soothe tensions, with Ramaphosa going to the White House in May with a large delegation that included white members of his coalition government and also famous white South African golfers.But Trump ambushed the Oval Office meeting with claims that white South African farmers were being killed and \"persecuted\" - producing unsubstantiated evidence that has been widely discredited.Further efforts by South Africa to mend the relationship failed, with Africa's largest economy being hit in August with 30% tariffs on goods being exported to the US - the highest rate in sub-Saharan Africa.Additional reporting by Stuart Hughes",

    "body": "23 minutes agoLucy Clarke-Billings and Jonathan Head,South East Asia correspondentGettyStrong winds hit Quy Nhon beach in Gia Lai province, central Vietnam, on ThursdayTyphoon Kalmaegi made landfall in Vietnam on Thursday after killing at least 114 people and flooding entire towns in the Philippines. More than 260,000 soldiers are on standby for rescue efforts as winds of up to 92mph (149km/h) hit the country's coastline, according to Vietnamese media and the government's online portal.Six airports in the country have been forced to close and hundreds of flights are expected to be affected, the government warned. The country, which has already been battling record rains and floods, is now facing one of Asia's strongest typhoons this year.The country's environment ministry said on Thursday that \"the storm is on land, in the provinces of Dak Lak and Gia Lai\" in a statement quoted by various outlets, including the AFP news agency.The Vietnamese national weather forecaster says hundreds of localities in seven cities and provinces are at risk of flooding and landslides in the next six hours. There have already been reports of damage from several provinces, including roofs torn off homes, shattered glass panels at hotels, and trees uprooted or snapped along city streets and rural roads by powerful gusts.In the Quy Non area, trees have fallen on main roads and windows in hotels have smashed.The typhoon made landfall in Vietnam at 19:29 local time (12:29 GMT). About 30 minutes later, hundreds of residents in two communes of Dak Lak province called for help, local media reported.Many people reported that their homes had collapsed or been flooded, while strong winds and heavy rain continued to batter the area.Dak Lak province is approximately 350km (215 miles) north-east of Ho Chi Minh City.The typhoon could generate waves of up to 8m (26ft) on the South China Sea, according to Vietnam's weather bureau. Vietnam's military has deployed more than 260,000 soldiers and personnel, along with more than 6,700 vehicles and pieces of equipment, including six aircraft, to help with storm relief efforts.On Wednesday morning, a reporter from AFP news agency saw officials knocking on the doors of homes in coastal communities and warning people to evacuate.According to local media reports, Prime Minister of Vietnam Pham Minh Chinh held an online meeting to direct the emergency response.\"We must reach isolated areas and ensure people have food, drinking water, and essential supplies,\" he was quoted as saying.\"No one should be left hungry or cold.\" AFP via Getty ImagesThe clean up begins at a hotel in VietnamBefore making landfall in Vietnam, the typhoon, known locally as Tino, left a trail of devastation in the Philippines.At least 114 people were killed and tens of thousands were evacuated, particularly from central areas including the populous island and tourist hotspot of Cebu, where cars were swept through the streets. Kalmaegi dumped the equivalent of a month of rain on the island in just 24 hours, sending torrents of mud and debris down mountainsides and into urban areas. Stunned survivors who had made it to higher ground watched as buses and shipping containers were tossed about in the raging floodwaters. The storm has wiped out entire neighbourhoods in poorer districts, where building materials are flimsier.Mely Saberon looked on in despair at the pile of debris that had once been her home in Talisay City, which suffered some of the worst destruction.\"We don't have any home anymore,\" she said. \"We weren't able to salvage anything from our house. \"We didn't expect the surge of rain and wind. We've experienced many typhoons before, but this one was different.\"Residents have now started the backbreaking task of cleaning away the thick layer of mud, and picking through the wreckage for anything that can be used. Early on Thursday, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr declared a state of emergency, the threshold of which involves mass casualty, major damage to property, and disruption to means of livelihoods and the normal way of life for people in the affected areas.ReutersHomes were destroyed in floods caused by Typhoon Kalmaegi in Talisay, Cebu, Philippines, on 5 November Vietnam has already been battling with floods and record rains for the past week.Burst riverbanks have flooded some of the country's most popular tourist spots, including the Unesco-listed city of Hue and historic hotspot Hoi An, where residents have been pictured navigating the city in wooden boats after the Hoai river overflowed.Seaside communities in Vietnam are expected to be hit hard by Typhoon Kalmaegi. A sea-level rise of 4 to 6m (13 to 20ft) in at least two provinces could capsize boats and devastate fishing farms, according to a forecast issued at 16:00 local time (9:00 GMT) by a senior official at Vietnam's National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.Meanwhile, deputy director Nguyen Xuan Hien says Typhoon Damrey - which struck Vietnam in 2017 with less intensity than Kalmaegi, but still caused severe damage to coastal communities - should serve as a warning and urged people to remain highly alert.Thailand is also bracing for the storm's impact. Local officials have warned of flash floods, landslides and river overflows.EPAWaves crashed on the beach in Cua Dai, Da Nang, central Vietnam, on Thursday",

    "body": "3 hours agoTom BatemanState Department correspondentA former chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC) has told the BBC that US air strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats would be treated under international law as crimes against humanity.The comments by Luis Moreno Ocampo come as the Trump administration faces mounting questions over the legality of the attacks in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific - which have killed at least 66 people in the last two months.The administration says it is in a formal armed conflict with South American traffickers who are bringing drugs into the US.But Mr Moreno Ocampo said the military campaign fell into the category of a planned, systematic attack against civilians during peacetime.This, he said, meant that the campaign fell into the category of crimes against humanity.\"These are criminals, not soldiers. Criminals are civilians,\" said Mr Moreno Ocampo of the US allegations against the boat crews. \"They are criminals, and we should do better at investigating them, prosecuting them and controlling them, but not killing people,\" he told the BBC.The White House said in response that President Donald Trump acted in line with the laws of armed conflict to protect the US from cartels \"trying to bring poison to our shores... destroying American lives.\" It highlighted that the ICC had no jurisdiction over the United States and argued that it was a \"biased, unserious entity\".\"It's ridiculous that they are now lecturing President Trump and running cover for evil narcoterrorists trying to murder Americans,\" said White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly.Mr Moreno Ocampo, a lawyer from Argentina who helped lead the 1985 prosecution of that country's former military junta, described the strikes as a \"very dangerous\" expansion of the president's remit to use lethal force. In the past, he said, alleged drug boats would be stopped and suspects incarcerated.\"The US is alleging it can kill whoever they want, and that's a huge change because in the past the US, in particular after 1945, was the guarantor of global peace to protect Western values, basically,\" he said.\"That's… a very bad trend for the world,\" added Mr Moreno Ocampo, who served as the first chief prosecutor at the ICC from 2003 to 2012, opening investigations in seven different countries.The US is not a signatory to the Rome Statute which established the ICC and has recently sanctioned several of its judges in retaliation for the court's investigations related to the US and Israel.Mr Moreno Ocampo said: \"For me, it's very clear. A crime against humanity is a systematic attack against a civilian population, and there is no clarity why these people are not civilians, even [though] they could be criminals... and it's clearly systematic, because President Trump says they have planned and they organised this, so that should be the charge.\"The Trump administration has sought to justify the boat strikes by saying the US is engaged in an armed conflict with drug cartels who are \"unlawful combatants\" whose actions \"constitute an armed attack against the United States\", according to a confidential note to Congress.In February, it designated eight Latin American organised crime groups as foreign terrorist organisations (FTOs), naming Tren de Aragua in Venezuela, MS-13 in El Salvador and others. The move marked a significant extension in the use of FTO designations.On 2 September, Trump announced the first US airstrike on a vessel he said was a \"drug-carrying boat\" operated by Tren de Aragua with \"a lot of drugs\" onboard, killing 11 people. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro called the attack a \"heinous crime\".Since then, at least 13 further strikes have taken place. No evidence has been made public for the claims of drugs onboard, nor which substances are allegedly involved. The BBC has repeatedly asked the Pentagon for names of the those targeted, but none have been given.Meanwhile, a major US military buildup has taken place in the region, leading to speculation about future land strikes, though Trump recently downplayed the possibility of any war unfolding. Maduro sees the action as an attempt to drive him from power. Venezuela plays a relatively minor role in the region's drug trade.An FTO designation - of the sort used by the Trump administration against the drugs traffickers - carries no inherent legal weight when it comes to the use of lethal military force, according to Brian Finucane, a former legal adviser at the US Department of State. He described the overall US legal position on the strikes as \"completely unconvincing\".\"You're left with a situation which involves premeditated killing outside of armed conflict, and we refer to that as murder,\" he said.Republicans in Congress have largely rallied around Trump's military action. On Wednesday, in a classified meeting, Secretary of State Marco Rubio briefed key lawmakers on the attacks. Afterwards, James Risch, a Republican on the Senate intelligence committee, said he was \"fully satisfied\" they were lawful.\"The administration has kept me and other members fully advised… They've got good legal justification for what they're doing,\" he said.\"The president really ought to be congratulated for saving the lives of young American people,\" Risch added.But many opposition Democrats have challenged the legality of the strikes. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, said after leaving the briefing: \"What we heard isn't enough. We need a lot more answers and I am now asking [the administration] for an all-senators briefing on this issue,\" he said.Under the US Constitution, the power to declare war rests with Congress. Many past presidents have ordered military action without congressional approval, but usually provide legal justifications as required by the 1973 War Powers Resolution which sets out limits on the president's powers.Following a classified briefing to members of the House Armed Services Committee last Thursday, Democratic Congresswoman Sara Jacobs said Pentagon officials had not provided a legal justification for what she called \"extrajudicial killings where we have no evidence\".She added that lawmakers were told the strikes had targeted the alleged trafficking of cocaine instead of fentanyl – though fentanyl is the substance linked to the majority of overdose related deaths from illicit drugs in the US.",

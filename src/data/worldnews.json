    "body": "Four people have been killed and 12 others injured, four critically, after a mass shooting in the US state of Mississippi.The shooting happened at around midnight on the main street in Leland, a small town 120 miles (190km) north-east of the state capital Jackson, the small city's Mayor John Lee told the BBC.Four of the injured were airlifted to hospital, Lee added. No suspects were in custody, but a police manhunt was under way.Leland was busier than usual on Friday with the local high school scheduled to play a football game to mark homecoming, an annual US tradition, usually in autumn, when former students are welcomed back to celebrate school spirit and community. The mayor said that the shooting did not take place on the Leland High School campus.\"This is an event where we have held yearly for years and hadn't had any incidents of this sort, ever,\" Lee told BBC. \"And we're a city that, not high crime and about 3,700 people. We all get along, and everybody knows everybody. So this is definitely a tragedy to us.\"The Leland Police Department is still investigating the incident and told the BBC it cannot share any further details at this time, including how many rounds were fired and what kind of gun was used. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is helping the inquiry.State Senator Derrick Simmons told the Associated Press that the scene was \"very chaotic\" after the gunfire erupted, as police and first responders rushed to the area \"from all over\". \"People were just congregating and having a good time in the downtown of Leland,\" Simmons told the AP. Officials are asking for anyone with information about the \"horrific\" shooting to come forward, Simmons added. A deadly shooting was also reported on Friday night in another small Mississippi town, Heidelberg, about 200 miles south-east of Leland.That attack also happened during the town's homecoming weekend, and claimed two lives, Heidelberg Police Chief Cornell White told the AP. There is no indication the Leland and Heidelberg shootings were linked. ",

    "body": "Former US President Joe Biden is receiving radiation therapy as part of his treatment for prostate cancer, his spokesman has said.The spokesman also said that Biden, 82, was undergoing hormone treatment, without giving any further details.The radiation treatment was expected to span five weeks and marked a new point in his care, a source told NBC News.In May, Biden's office announced that he had been diagnosed with a more aggressive form of the disease, which had spread to his bones. The discovery came after the Democratic politician reported urinary symptoms that led doctors to find a small nodule on his prostate. The Biden office said at the time that \"he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterised by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone\".\"While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management.\"A Gleason score of nine meant his illness was classified as \"high-grade\" and the cancer cells could spread quickly, according to Cancer Research UK.A person close to Biden has said the former president is doing well and responding to treatment, the BBC's US news partner CBS reported, with another source telling the outlet that the radiation started \"a few weeks ago\" in Philadelphia. Biden left office in January as the oldest serving US president in history and questions about his health dogged his first term, leading him to end his run for re-election late in his campaign.His former Vice-President, Kamala Harris, ran instead as the Democrats' presidential candidate, losing to current US President Donald Trump.For many years, Biden has advocated for cancer research.In 2022, he and his wife Jill Biden relaunched the \"cancer moonshot\" initiative with the goal of mobilising research efforts to prevent more than four million cancer deaths by the year 2047.Biden lost his eldest son, Beau, to brain cancer in 2015.The former president and vice-president has also been treated twice for skin cancer, in 2023 and 2025.In recent months, Biden has largely retreated from the public eye. In May, he sat down for an interview with the BBC - his first since leaving the White House - where he admitted that the decision to step down from the 2024 race was \"difficult\".Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer affecting men, behind skin cancer, according to the American Cancer Society.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that 13 out of every 100 men will develop prostate cancer at some point in their lives. It says age is the most common risk factor.",

    "body": "9 hours agoCarrie DaviesPakistan correspondent,Stuart Lau andEthirajan AnbarasanThe Taliban government has confirmed that it attacked Pakistani troops in multiple mountainous locations on the northern border.A Taliban spokesman said 58 Pakistani military personnel had been killed in what it called \"an act of retaliation\". It claimed Pakistan had violated Afghan airspace and bombed a market inside its border on Thursday.Pakistan has disputed that figure, saying 23 of its armed forces' members had died and claiming that \"200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralized\". Pakistan's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said the Afghan attacks were \"unprovoked\" and civilians were fired at, warning that his country's forces would respond \"with a stone for every brick\".Islamabad has accused Kabul of harbouring terrorists who target Pakistan on its soil, a claim the Taliban government rejected.Both the Afghan and Pakistani sides are said to have used small arms and artillery in the Kunar-Kurram region, the BBC understands.At a press conference on Sunday, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in addition to the 58 Pakistani military deaths, around 30 others had been wounded.He added that nine Taliban fighters had died and between 16 and 18 people had been injured.Pakistan Armed Forces said 29 of its soldiers had been injured, and the number of wounded Taliban and \"affiliated\" fighters was in the hundreds.Afghanistan’s foreign minister said in a press conference in New Delhi that \"we have no problems\" with Pakistan's people and its leadership but added \"there are some groups in Pakistan that are trying to spoil the situation. Afghanistan has a right to keep its territory and its borders safe, and so it has retaliated to the violation.\"Pakistan's interior minister said he \"strongly condemns\" the Taliban's attacks: \"The firing by Afghan forces on civilian populations is a blatant violation of international laws.\"Afghanistan is playing a game of fire and blood,\" he said in a post on X.The two main crossings between Pakistan and Afghanistan - Torkham in the north and Chaman in the south - have been closed, leaving hundreds of trucks carrying goods stranded on both sides. A Pakistani military spokesman said they would take necessary measures to safeguard Pakistani lives and properties.Pakistan's military has not officially commented, but a security source speaking to the BBC claimed that firing took place at several locations along the Pakistani-Afghan border, including Angoor Adda, Bajaur, Kurram, Dir, Chitral and Baramcha.A police official stationed near the Zero Point in Kurram district told the BBC that heavy weapons fire began from the Afghan side around 22:00 local time (17:00 GMT).He said they had received reports of intense gunfire from multiple locations along the border.Last week, Afghanistan's Taliban government accused Pakistan of violating Kabul's \"sovereign territory\", as two loud blasts were heard in the city late on Thursday.Pakistan bombed a civilian market in the border province of Paktika, in Afghanistan's south-east, the Taliban Defence Ministry said on Friday. Locals there told the BBC's Afghan service that a number of shops had been destroyed.A top Pakistani general alleged Afghanistan was being used as a \"base of operation for terrorism against Pakistan\". Pakistan has long accused the Afghan Taliban of permitting the Pakistan Taliban,  known as the TTP, to operate from their land and fight against the Islamabad government in a bid to enforce a strict Islamic-led system of governance. The Afghan Taliban government has always denied this.The latest escalation coincided with an historic week-long trip to India made by Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, his first since the Taliban's return to power. In a diplomatic thaw, New Delhi said that it would reopen the embassy in Kabul, which was shut four years ago.\"Afghanistan will also be given a befitting reply like India, so that it will not dare to look at Pakistan with a malicious eye,\" Naqvi warned.In a statement, Saudi Arabia, which signed a mutual defence pact with Pakistan last month, called for self-restraint and avoidance of escalation between Islamabad and Kabul.Qatar also expressed concern over the Pakistan-Afghanistan border tensions, calling on both sides to \"prioritise dialogue, diplomacy, and restraint\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoRushdi AbualoufGaza correspondent in IstanbulAt least 27 people have been killed in fierce clashes between Hamas security forces and armed members of the Dughmush family in Gaza City, in one of the most violent internal confrontations since the end of major Israeli operations in the enclave.Masked Hamas gunmen exchanged fire with clan fighters near the city's Jordanian hospital, witnesses said.A senior official in the Hamas-run interior ministry said security units surrounded them and engaged in heavy fighting to detain them. The ministry said eight its members were killed in \"an armed assault by a militia\".Medical sources said 19 Dughmush clan members and eight Hamas fighters had been killed since fighting began on Saturday.Eyewitnesses said the clashes erupted in the Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood in southern Gaza City after a Hamas force of more than 300 fighters moved to storm a residential block where Dughmush gunmen were entrenched.Residents described scenes of panic as dozens of families fled their homes under heavy gunfire, many of them displaced multiple times during the war. \"This time people weren't fleeing Israeli attacks,\" one resident said. \"They were running from their own people.\"The Dughmush family, one of Gaza's most prominent clans, has long had a tense relationship with Hamas, and its armed members have clashed with the group on several occasions in the past.The Hamas-run interior ministry said its forces were seeking to restore order, warning that \"any armed activity outside the framework of the resistance\" would be dealt with firmly.Both sides traded accusations over who was responsible for triggering the clashes.Hamas earlier said Dughmush gunmen killed two of its fighters and wounded five others, prompting the group to launch an operation against them.However, a source from the Dughmush family told local media that Hamas forces had come to a building that once served as the Jordanian Hospital, where the family had taken refuge after their homes in the al-Sabra neighbourhood were destroyed in the recent Israeli attack.The source claimed that Hamas sought to evict the family from the building to establish a new base for its forces there.Hamas has recalled about 7,000 members of its security forces to reassert control over areas of Gaza recently vacated by Israeli troops, according to local sources.Reports suggest armed Hamas units have already deployed across several districts, some wearing civilian clothes and others in the blue uniforms of the Gaza police. The Hamas media office denied it was deploying \"fighters in the streets\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoStephen McDonellChina correspondent andNick Edserbusiness reporterDonald Trump's latest threat to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods is \"a typical example of US double standards\", China's government has said.A commerce ministry spokesperson also said China could introduce its own unspecified \"countermeasures\" if the US president carries out his threat, adding it was \"not afraid\" of a possible trade war.On Friday, Trump hit back at Beijing's move to tighten its rules for rare earths exports, accusing it  of \"becoming very hostile\" and trying to hold the world \"captive\". He also threatened to pull out of a meeting with China's President Xi Jinping later this month.But on Sunday, Trump wrote: \"Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!\" \"Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn't want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!\" Trump said in a post on social media, without elaborating further. Trump's comments on Friday rattled financial markets, with the S&P 500 share index closing down 2.7%, its steepest fall since April.The president's words renewed fears of a trade war between the US and China.In May, the two sides had agreed to drop triple-digit tariffs on each others' goods. which had raised the prospect of trade halting between the two countries.This left US tariffs on Chinese goods facing an added 30% levy compared with the start of the year, while US goods entering China face a 10% tariff.China's response - released by the commerce ministry in the form of written responses to journalist's questions - echoed language from the height of the recent trade conflict.They criticised US export restrictions on chips and semi-conductors as well as defending China's own export controls on rare earths as \"normal actions\" to safeguard national security and that of all nations.The spokesperson said that for \"a long time\", the US had \"overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures\" and \"adopted discriminatory practices against China\".\"Resorting to tariff threats is not the right way to engage with China,\" the spokesperson said.\"China's position on a tariff war has always been consistent: we do not want one, but we are not afraid of one.\"Last week, China announced it was tightening export controls on rare earths and other materials critical for advanced tech manufacturing.This was seen as key move, as the country processes about 90% of the world's rare earths, which are used in goods such as solar panels and smartphones.The recent comments from Washington and Beijing are being seen by some as a means of strengthening positions ahead of future trade talks.It is unclear whether a meeting between Trump and Xi, expected at a summit in South Korea later this month, will still proceed.",

    "body": "1 day agoNorberto ParedesBBC Mundo andAlex BoydWatch: 'A great honour for Venezuelan society' - Machado speaks to the BBCNobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado has told the BBC she is grateful for what US President Donald Trump is doing \"around the world for peace\".Machado, Venezuela's opposition leader, was awarded the 2025 prize having long campaigned against the country's President Nicolás Maduro Moros, whose 12-year rule is viewed by many as illegitimate.She told BBC Mundo that during a congratulatory phone call with Trump she told him \"how grateful the Venezuelan people are for what he's doing, not only in the Americas, but around the world for peace, for freedom, for democracy\".Trump has made no secret about wanting to win the award himself, regularly speaking about the seven wars he claims to have ended.Nominations for the award closed in January, just as Trump's second term as president began. A White House official said on Friday the \"Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace\".Machado said she was \"very glad\" to speak to the US president and was \"able to convey to him our appreciation\".The 58-year-old, forced to live in hiding for much of the past year, was hailed by the Nobel Committee as \"one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times\".Nobel chairman Jørgen Watne Frydnes said she was recognised for \"her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy\".He added: \"Despite serious threats against her life, she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions.\"Machado was barred from running in last year's presidential elections, in which Maduro won a third six-year term in office.The elections were widely dismissed on the international stage as neither free nor fair, and sparked protests across the country.Even after she was barred from the polls, she managed to unite the notoriously divided opposition faction and succeeded in getting millions of Venezuelans behind the little-known candidate which replaced her on the ballot, Edmundo González.When the government-controlled National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner - even though tallies from polling stations showed that González had won by a landslide - Machado continued to campaign from hiding as the Maduro government has repeatedly threatened her with arrest.Machado told BBC Mundo her award was \"like an injection\" for her political movement.\"It infuses energy, hope, strength on the Venezuelan people because we realise that we are not alone,\" she added. \"The democrats around the world share our struggle.\"She said she thought Trump and the international community were already helping with the political situation in Venezuela.\"The regime in Venezuela is a criminal structure,\" Machado told the BBC. \"And as such, it sustains themselves on the criminal flows from their illicit activities.\"We need the international community to cut those flows that are not only used for corruption, but also for repression, violence and terror.\"So when you cut the inflows that come from drug trafficking, gold smuggling, arms smuggling, human trafficking, or the black market of oil, then the regime falls.\"And that's exactly what we're seeing, cracks that are getting deeper and deeper as we talk right now.\"Earlier this month, US forces killed four people in an attack on a boat off the coast of Venezuela that was allegedly trafficking drugs.It was the latest in a number of recent strikes by the US on boats in international waters it said were involved in \"narco-trafficking\".They have attracted condemnation in countries including Venezuela and Colombia, with some international lawyers describing the strikes as a breach of international law.On Thursday Colombian President Gustavo Petro said one of the boats was \"Colombian with Colombian citizens inside\", an allegation the White House called \"baseless\".",

He pivoted the West African state towards Russia in a bid to stem a growing insurgency by jihadists. He expelled French troops, and brought in mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group, which is under Moscow's defence ministry. They have since been replaced by Africa Corps. Last week, Burkina Faso's military government refused to take in deportees from the US, as Washington suspended issuing visas in the West African nation.Foreign affairs minister Karamoko Jean-Marie Traoré questioned if the embassy's decision was \"blackmail\" after he said he had rejected a US proposal to take in migrants from third countries.The Trump administration has turned to African countries as a destination to deport migrants to as part of its crackdown on immigration.",

    "body": "2 days agoBrandon DrenonWashington DC First Lady Melania Trump says Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to her letter of concern about the child victims of the Russia-Ukraine war.She made the announcement on Friday, saying that after an \"open channel of communication\" with Putin, Ukranian children displaced in the war had been reunited with families.The First Lady's \"peace letter\" was hand delivered to Putin during his Alaska visit in August.President Donald Trump shared parts of the letter on social media. In it, the first lady pleads with Putin to protect children, writing that doing so \"will do more than serve Russia alone\" and \"will serve humanity itself\".\"Eight children have been rejoined with their families during the past 24 hours,\" Mrs Trump said, flanked by American flags behind a podium in the White House.\"Each child has lived in turmoil because of the war in Ukraine.\"Of the eight children, the First Lady said three separated from their families were displaced to Russia because of front-line fighting.Another young girl displaced by the conflict has now been returned from Ukraine to Russia, Mrs Trump says.The children's reunification with their families was facilitated by both Ukraine and Russia, the First Lady said, adding that she was given a detailed report with photographs and the \"identities and circumstances\" of each child.The US government \"confirmed the facts\", she said.Mrs Trump said she has \"learned a lot about this matter\" since her letter was first handed to Putin. She said he responded in writing. In her letter, the First Lady wrote: \"Every child shares the same quiet dreams in their heart... They dream of love, possibility, and safety from danger.\" The announcement marks a positive development in her advocacy for children from the White House, which began during President Trump's first term. She launched the BE BEST initiative in January 2021, which the White House describes as an awareness campaign focused around the well-being of children globally.Earlier this year, the First Lady led an initiative for Congress to pass a bill banning revenge porn called the Take It Down Act. After the bill was signed, she said it was \"a powerful statement that we stand united in protecting the dignity, privacy, and safety of our children\".According to the Ukrainian government, at least 19,500 Ukrainian children have been deported and forcibly displaced from their homes to Russia and Russian-occupied territories since February 2022.Just 1,605 have come home so far, according to the government's Children of War database, external.The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Children's Rights Commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, in 2023 for the alleged unlawful deportation of children.Russia denies the accusation and says it has protected children by moving them from a war zone for their safety.",

    "body": "Rare wildflowers blanket Atacama desert2 days agoBBC WeatherAFP via Getty Images/Jose TorresThe Atacama desert in Chile sits long and lean, sandwiched between the Andes Mountains and the Pacific Ocean.The desert's extreme aridity makes it one of the clearest places on Earth to view the night sky and is famous for being home to the largest radio telescope in the world. But the usually barren landscape has been transformed by a carpet of colourful wildflowers, which have been brought to life by significant rainfall during the southern hemisphere's winter months.This is thought to be an event that only occurs every few years, when above average rainfall soaks the desert floor, causing dormant seeds to spring to life.Anadolu via Getty Images/Lucas Aguayo AraosAFP via Getty Images/Jose TorresThe Atacama desert typically receives less than 15mm of rain every year.But the area had more than 12mm of rain during August alone - most of which fell on just one day.The desert even saw a rare blanket of snow back in June.AFP via Getty Images/Jose TorresThis magnificent bloom is made up of more than 200 different species of wildflowers, some of which do not grow anywhere else in the world. It typically occurs between the end of August and November.Although thought of as rare, this phenomenon also occurred in 2024, following heavy rainfall in the area.This year's display will be at its peak for another few weeks, according to CONAF, Chile's National Forest Corporation.Click here to play 'Cooler than me?'",

    "body": "Indian student captured by Ukraine joined Russian army to avoid drug charges, says mother 23 hours agoGopal KateshiyaBBC Gujarati, MorbiHasina MajotiSahil Majothi had gone to Russia to study computer engineeringUkraine has captured an Indian national allegedly fighting for Russian forces, the first known Indian detained in the ongoing war.Sahil Majothi, 22, from the Indian state of Gujarat, went to Russia to study computer engineering two years ago. His mother claims he was falsely accused in a drug case last April.Mr Majothi joined the Russian army to avoid imprisonment over drug charges,  according to a video released by Ukraine's army on Tuesday.The Indian foreign ministry says it is investigating the case and has not received formal communication from Ukraine. The BBC has asked the Russian government for a response. In an interview with BBC Gujarati, Mr Majothi's mother Hasina Majothi said her son went to Russia in January 2024. He completed a three-month language course in St Petersburg before moving to Moscow for college, supporting himself part-time as a kitchenware courier.She alleges that in April 2024, someone slipped drugs into a parcel handed to Mr Majothi during his deliveries.\"The police caught him with it and charged him,\" Ms Hasina said. According to Ms Hasina, her son was detained, held for six months and later sentenced to seven years in prison. The family hired a private lawyer in Russia to defend him, but they had no idea when or how he was drafted into the military.\"I don't know how he ended up in Ukraine. I only found out through the viral video,\" Ms Hasina said.In the video released by the 63rd Mechanized Brigade of the Ukrainian army, Mr Majothi can be heard saying he was given a choice between joining the Russian army, with pay for his service, or serving jail time. He said he was told he would serve in the military for a year before being released. Mr Majothi claims that different people promised him varying amounts of money - from a hundred thousand to over a million roubles - but he never received any payment.He says he underwent 15 days of training in September 2024 and was sent to the battlefield a year later, on 30 September.The next day, on 1 October, Mr Majothi said he had an altercation with his commander, after which he separated from Russian soldiers. That was when he came across a Ukrainian dugout and asked them for help, he added.The BBC cannot independently verify the date or location of the video in which he makes these claims. Ukrainian army/FacebookMr Majothi says he underwent 15 days of training before being sent to the battlefield a year laterOn Wednesday, after the video went viral, Gujarat's Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS)  questioned Ms Hasina and her brother in Ahmedabad. Her relatives said she separated from her husband around her son's birth and supports her family as a seamstress while living with her maternal relatives.ATS officials confirmed Mr Majothi's arrest and subsequent detention in Russia. They said the family claimed to have had no contact with him since his arrest. At his former school in Morbi, teachers called Mr Majothi an \"average student\" but deeply motivated to fulfil his mother's dreams through education. They spoke on condition of anonymity.Local community leaders have also appealed to the government to intervene and secure his return. \"Many young men like him have been trapped and dragged into the war,\" said  Kasam Sumra. \"We appeal to the government to bring back Sahil and other young Indians who went abroad seeking work.\" Mr Majothi's arrest comes amid rising concerns over Indians being recruited into the Russian military. Reports say over 150 Indians, some on student or visitor visas, have enlisted. At least 12 have died in the conflict and 16 remain missing.In September, Indian officials urged Moscow to release and repatriate 27 Indian nationals who had been recruited into the army.The Indian government has consistently advised its citizens against participating in the ongoing war in Ukraine.\"We once again strongly urge all Indian nationals to stay away from offers to serve in the Russian army, as they are fraught with danger and risk to life,\" a spokesperson from India's foreign ministry said last month.Additional reporting by Roxy Gagdekar Chhara from Ahmedabad and Nikita Yadav from DelhiFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "Trump directs Pentagon to 'use all available funds' to pay troops during shutdownDonald Trump is directing US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth to pay military personnel despite the federal government shutdown. The president said on Saturday that Hegseth must make sure troops do not miss out on their regular paycheque, scheduled for Wednesday. The directive comes as other government employees have already had some pay withheld and others are being laid off.\"I will not allow the Democrats to hold our Military, and the entire Security of our Nation, HOSTAGE, with their dangerous Government Shutdown,\" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. The Republican and Democratic parties blame each other for failing to agree on a spending plan to reopen the government.Trump's message asks Hegseth to \"use all available funds to get our Troops PAID\" on 15 October, when military personnel would see their pay withheld for the first time since the shutdown began on 1 October.Many US military employees are considered \"essential\", meaning they must still show up for duty without pay. Some 750,000 other federal employees - about 40% - have been furloughed, or sent home, also without pay.Furloughed employees are legally supposed to receive back-pay after a shutdown ends and they return to work, but the Trump administration has insinuated this might not happen.\"The Radical Left Democrats should OPEN THE GOVERNMENT, and then we can work together to address Healthcare, and many other things that they want to destroy,\" Trump posted on Saturday.Democrats have refused to vote for a Republican spending plan that would reopen the government after nearly 12 days shut down, saying any resolution must preserve expiring tax credits that reduce health insurance costs for millions of Americans and reverse Trump's cuts to Medicaid, the healthcare program for elderly and low-income people.Republicans accuse Democrats of unnecessarily bringing the government to a halt, and blame them for the knock-on effects caused by the federal work stoppage.Finding a way to pay for military salaries could help reduce some of the political risk  for congressional leaders if the shutdown drags on.In an effort to pressure Democrats, the Trump administration has also begun laying off thousands of government workers, an unprecedented move during a shutdown.\"The RIFs have begun,\" White House Office of Management Director Russell Vought announced in a post on X on Friday morning, referring to an acronym for \"reductions in force\".The administration disclosed later on Friday that seven agencies had started firing more than 4,000 people, making good on the president's repeated threats to use the shutdown to further his long-held goal of reducing the federal workforce.The reductions included dozens of employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), according to the BBC's US partner CBS news, citing sources familiar with the situation. The agency's entire Washington DC office was laid off, the sources told CBS, adding that among the laid-off employees were those working on the CDC's Mortality and Morbidity Weekly Report, the agency's Ebola response and immunisations. There were also reductions in the human resources department, they said. Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, told CBS that the let-go workers were not essential, and that \"HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities, including those that are at odds with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda\".Employees at the Treasury Department and in the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in the Department of Homeland Security were also among those laid off on Friday, those agencies confirmed.   The American Federation of Government Employees and AFL-CIO, two major unions representing federal workers, have filed a lawsuit in northern California, asking a judge to temporarily block the layoff orders. \"It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country,\" AFGE president Everett Kelley said.A spokesman from the White House budget office told the BBC on Saturday that the layoffs were just the beginning.\"These RIF numbers from the court filing are just a snapshot in time,\" he said. \"More RIFs are coming.\"In a court filing opposing the unions' request for a temporary restraining order, the justice department revealed that agencies such as the Departments of Education, Housing and Urban Development, Commerce and Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency could also see staff cuts. The government lawyers said the labour unions had failed to establish that their members would be irreparably harmed by the layoffs, which is needed for the judge to grant the restraining order. But they said a restraining order would \"irreparably harm the government\". Are you a federal worker in the US? Get in touch here",

    "body": "1 day agoRushdi AbualoufGaza correspondent in IstanbulHamas has recalled about 7,000 members of its security forces to reassert control over areas of Gaza recently vacated by Israeli troops, according to local sources.The Palestinian group also appointed five new governors all with military backgrounds, some of whom previously commanded brigades in its armed wing.The mobilisation order was reportedly issued via phone calls and text messages which said the aim was to \"cleanse Gaza of outlaws and collaborators with Israel\" and told fighters to report within 24 hours.Reports from Gaza suggest armed Hamas units have already deployed across several districts, some wearing civilian clothes and others in the blue uniforms of the Gaza police. The Hamas media office denied it was deploying \"fighters in the streets\".Tensions rose sharply and quickly after two members of Hamas's elite forces were shot dead by gunmen from the powerful Dughmush clan in Gaza City's Sabra neighbourhood. One of them was the son of a senior commander in Hamas's armed wing, Imad Aqel, who now heads the group's military intelligence.Their bodies were left in the street, triggering anger and raising the prospect of a major armed response by Hamas.Hamas members later surrounded a large area where more than 300 Dughmush gunmen were believed to be holed up, armed with machine guns and improvised explosives.This morning Hamas killed one Dughmush clan member, and reportedly kidnapped another 30.Some of the clan's weapons were looted from Hamas depots during the war, while others had been in the clan's possession for years.Palestinians return to devastation in Gaza CityWhat we know about the Gaza ceasefire agreementWho are the 48 hostages still held in Gaza?The Hamas mobilisation had been widely anticipated amid growing uncertainty about who will govern Gaza once the war ends.This is a key issue that could complicate the start of the second phase of US President Donald Trump's peace plan, which calls for Hamas to disarm.A Hamas official abroad declined to comment directly on reports of the security deployment, but told the BBC: \"We cannot leave Gaza at the mercy of thieves and militias backed by the Israeli occupation. Our weapons are legitimate... to resist occupation, and they will remain as long as the occupation continues.\"A retired security officer who served for years with the Palestinian Authority in Gaza said he feared the territory was sliding towards another round of internal bloodshed. \"Hamas hasn't changed. It still believes that weapons and violence are the only means to keep its movement alive,\" he told the BBC. \"Gaza is flooded with arms. Looters have stolen thousands of weapons and rounds of ammunition from Hamas stores during the war, and some groups have even received supplies from Israel. \"This is a perfect recipe for civil war: weapons, frustration, chaos, and a movement desperate to reassert control over a shattered and exhausted population.\"Khalil Abu Shammala, a human rights expert who lives in Gaza, said it remained to be seen whether Hamas would accept handing over control on the ground or seek to obstruct the plan's implementation.  \"There is undoubtedly widespread fear among many Gazans of potential internal fighting, given the many conditions that could fuel it,\" he said.He said Hamas had been forced to accept the peace plan by the severe pressure it was under.\"I believe its continued attempts to maintain influence by any means, including involvement in security affairs, could ultimately jeopardise the agreement and plunge Gaza's residents into even greater suffering,\" he said.These developments since the ceasefire earlier this week have sparked deep concern among Gazans already worn down by two years of a devastating conflict.",

The statement by the Danish defence ministry says the purpose of its military is security, and if necessary, defence in the Nato security alliance.\"The task of the Armed Forces is to ensure security throughout the Kingdom - and, if necessary, to defend Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Denmark within the framework of Nato in all domains,\" the Chief of Defence, Michael Hyldgaard, told Danish public broadcaster DR, without saying who the potential adversaries were.Denmark worked on the new defence package with the governments of Greenland and the Faroe Islands.It will buy two new Arctic ships, maritime patrol planes, drones and early warning radar.Crucially, a new Arctic command headquarters will be set up in the Greenlandic capital, Nuuk, alongside a new military unit under Joint Arctic Command in Greenland.In addition, an undersea cable connecting Greenland and Denmark will be funded. The struggle for control of the Arctic is accelerating - and riskier than everGreenland in particular is strategically located between North America and Russia. Though the island has wide-ranging autonomy, it remains part of the kingdom of Denmark.In recent years, there has been increased interest in the vast island's natural resources, including mining for rare earth minerals, uranium and iron.Greenland lies on the shortest route from North America to Europe, making it strategically important for the US. The island has been home to a US radar base since the Cold War and also hosts a large American space facility.US President Donald Trump has suggested the island is crucial to military efforts to track Chinese and Russian ships, which he said are \"all over the place\".Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to acquire Greenland, saying the island was \"critical\" for national and economic security.Greenland's prime minister has said the territory is not for sale, adding that \"Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland\".",

Heavy rainfall on Thursday and Friday caused rivers to burst their banks. Hidalgo in east Mexico was one of the worst affected areas, with 16 deaths reported.   Thousands of houses have been damaged or destroyed as fast-running water careered down streets, carrying cars, while highways were blocked with debris and electricity cut off.  Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said the government has deployed 5,400 personnel to help communities, clear roads and hand out aid.She wrote on social media: \"We are working to support the population, open roads and restore electrical service.\"In addition, 3,300 naval troops are helping with evacuations as well as clearing up the aftereffects of the floods.In Puebla, state governor Alejandro Armenta said at least nine people had died while five others had been reported missing. An estimated 80,000 people have been impacted by the weather in Puebla alone, the state's government said.An additional two people died in Veracruz.\"No one was prepared for this,\" Jose Cervantes, owner of a coffee shop in one of the affected areas, told Reuters news agency.\"The flood reached a height of one and a half meters. Everything was flooded, the dining room and the entire restaurant, the kitchen, the bathroom, the games room, the private area. Everything is in terrible condition.\"",

    "body": "'In an instant, they were gone' - small town mourns after Tennessee explosives factory blast3 hours agoKwasi Gyamfi AsieduBucksnort, TennesseeBBCMourners gather for a vigil at the Maple Valley Baptist Church in Tennessee in memory of 16 people presumed dead after a blast at an explosives factoryIn Bucksnort, Tennessee, residents have spent a chilly autumn night heeding a simple message spraypainted on a concrete barrier by the side of the road: \"Pray for the AES families\". Community members gathered on Saturday for a candlelit vigil outside the Maple Valley Baptist Church after a blast at local explosives factory Accurate Energetic Systems (AES) left 16 people presumed dead.This community of Hickman and Humphreys Counties is \"not huge, so that's a lot of people to lose in an instant,\" Deacon Danny Bates said to the approximately 40 attendees, who comforted each other and sang hymns such as \"It Is Well With My Soul\".\"It was just another day at work, and then in an instant, they were gone. We have unanswered questions\".A concrete barrier on the side of a road reads \"Pray for AES families\".Vigil-goer Jerri Newcombe said her friend of more than 20 years was among the victims. The two met when Newcombe's granddaughter and the victim's daughter became close as little girls.\"They grew up together - we were in each other's homes,\" Newcombe told the BBC at the vigil. \"We celebrated birthdays together. It's just surreal, because she's gone and her babies are hurting,\" she said, referring to the victim's children and grandchildren. Local police have not publicly identified any of the unaccounted-for victims, who authorities presume have all been killed.Her friend was \"full of life\", Ms Newcombe said. \"She was the type of person that could make you laugh over anything, but you didn't cross her either, or she would tear into you,\" Ms. Newcombe added amid tears and laughter, as her granddaughter comforted her.Bucksnort is a close-knit town where the cell service is spotty and a gas station - adorned with a Confederate flag centrepiece - is the local watering hole, residents say. This tragedy has hit the area hard as the community mourns family, friends, neighbours and coworkers.The town had been holding out hope for good news after the explosion on Friday morning shook homes across the area, clouded the skies with smoke and drew a surge of hundreds of state and national first responders to an otherwise sleepy community tucked behind forests along a busy motorway.But after nearly two days with no sign of survivors and the explosion site still considered dangerous for first responders, even the previously optimistic Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis said the time had come to switch to a recovery - rather than rescue - strategy.\"At some point in time, we have got to rip off the Band-Aid,\" Davis, who has held back tears at news conferences, said. \"We are dealing with remains.\"Hickman County Sheriff Jason Craft told the BBC on Saturday night that rapid DNA analysis was still ongoing, but that after a search by 300 first responders, authorities had enough confidence in their assessment of the scene to notify families that their loved ones were likely deceased. No cause of the blast has yet been identified, and agents from the national Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) are investigating. It could take as long as a month for federal investigators to reach the main site of the explosion, ATF official Brice McCracken told the BBC. The volatile nature of the explosive materials has also hampered the emergency response, officials said, as controlled detonations to render the site safe are also expected in the coming days.Watch: Tennessee town comes together to confront tragedyTiffany Story says her cousin was also among the victims, along with four other people that she knew, including someone she once used to babysit for.\"Everybody knows everybody here,\" an emotional Mrs Story told the BBC. \"With everybody being so close, it's very comforting to have family. That's what we are - whether [by] blood, not blood, this whole community is family.\"\"There's probably never gonna be any answers\" to the tragedy, she said.Janie Brown said she also knew victims at the site. \"They were loved by their families and by the community,\" she said outside another prayer vigil at the Hurricane Chapel Free Will Baptist Church in nearby McEwen. \"It's just a sad, sad day,\" she said.Residents told the BBC the Accurate Energetic Systems (AES) company employed about 80 workers, and is one of the only private well-paying jobs around in these counties. For many here, the plant was known as a reliable first job for themselves or close friends.A recent job opening advertised a $19-per-hour salary for an entry-level manual labour job, more than double the state's minimum wage of $7.25.The factory has seen other difficulties, but none at such a scale as this.In 2014, an explosion at the company killed one person, and a 2019 workplace safety inspection led to relatively minor financial penalties, which the company settled, according to online records. Residents who spoke to the BBC had mostly positive feelings towards the company, and local police say they had no previous reports of unsafe working conditions.Hurricane Chapel Free Will Baptist Church Pastor Tim Ferris praised his congregation's response to the tragedy.\"One thing about a small community is that when something like this happens, they rally around each other, and they come close to be the hands and the feet of Jesus, to administer to these people, to care for them, provide for them. And that's a wonderful thing,\" he said.",

    "body": "Dutch volleyball player and convicted child rapist denied visa to compete in Australia1 day agoLana LamSydneyReutersSteven van de Velde was due to compete in Adelaide next monthA Dutch Olympic volleyball player convicted of raping a British girl a decade ago has been denied a visa to compete in Australia.Steven van de Velde, 31, was due to play at the Beach Volleyball World Championships in Adelaide, South Australia, next month.In 2016, the then 21-year-old pleaded guilty to three counts of raping a 12-year-old girl in Milton Keynes and was sentenced to four years in jail. He had met the girl on Facebook and travelled to England from Amsterdam before raping her in her home in 2014.Two weeks ago, South Australia's Attorney-General Kyam Maher wrote to the federal government, calling on authorities to reject his visa as his crimes were \"utterly abhorrent\".The letter also said \"we do not believe that foreign child sex offenders should be granted entry to this country\".Australia's Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the government will \"continue to use every tool we have available to ensure that Australians can be safe and feel safe in their communities\".After the rape in 2014, Van de Velde returned to the Netherlands but in 2016, he was extradited to the UK and arrested. Ahead of his sentencing, the court heard he was aware of the girl's age.He served 12 months of his four-year sentence and restarted his professional sporting career in 2018, playing for his national team in several global tournaments.Last year, he represented the Netherlands at the Paris Olympics and was booed by some people in the crowd. Earlier, an online petition calling for him to be banned from the Olympics had attracted 90,000 signatures.The BBC has contacted the organisers of the world championship event in South Australia and the Dutch national volleyball association for comment.

    "body": "1 day agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology Correspondent, San FranciscoOpenAI has released new estimates of the number of ChatGPT users who exhibit possible signs of mental health emergencies, including mania, psychosis or suicidal thoughts.The company said that around 0.07% of ChatGPT users active in a given week exhibited such signs, adding that its artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot recognizes and responds to these sensitive conversations.While OpenAI maintains these cases are \"extremely rare,\" critics said even a small percentage may amount to hundreds of thousands of people, as ChatGPT recently reached 800 million weekly active users, per boss Sam Altman.As scrutiny mounts, the company said it built a network of experts around the world to advise it.Those experts include more than 170 psychiatrists, psychologists, and primary care physicians who have practiced in 60 countries, the company said.They have devised a series of responses in ChatGPT to encourage users to seek help in the real world, according to OpenAI.But the glimpse at the company's data raised eyebrows among some mental health professionals.\"Even though 0.07% sounds like a small percentage, at a population level with hundreds of millions of users, that actually can be quite a few people,\" said Dr. Jason Nagata, a professor who studies technology use among young adults at the University of California, San Francisco.\"AI can broaden access to mental health support, and in some ways support mental health, but we have to be aware of the limitations,\" Dr. Nagata added.The company also estimates 0.15% of ChatGPT users have conversations that include \"explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.\"OpenAI said recent updates to its chatbot are designed to \"respond safely and empathetically to potential signs of delusion or mania\" and note \"indirect signals of potential self-harm or suicide risk.\"ChatGPT has also been trained to reroute sensitive conversations \"originating from other models to safer models\" by opening in a new window.In response to questions by the BBC on criticism about the numbers of people potentially affected, OpenAI said that this small percentage of users amounts to a meaningful amount of people and noted they are taking changes seriously. The changes come as OpenAI faces mounting legal scrutiny over the way ChatGPT interacts with users.In one of the most high-profile lawsuits recently filed against OpenAI, a California couple sued the company over the death of their teenage son alleging that ChatGPT encouraged him to take his own life in April.The lawsuit was filed by the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine and was the first legal action accusing OpenAI of wrongful death.In a separate case, the suspect in a murder-suicide that took place in August in Greenwich, Connecticut posted hours of his conversations with ChatGPT, which appear to have fuelled the alleged perpetrator's delusions.More users struggle with AI psychosis as \"chatbots create the illusion of reality,\" said Professor Robin Feldman, Director of the AI Law & Innovation Institute at the University of California Law. \"It is a powerful illusion.\"She said OpenAI deserved credit for \"sharing statistics and for efforts to improve the problem\" but added: \"the company can put all kinds of warnings on the screen but a person who is mentally at risk may not be able to heed those warnings.\" ",

    "body": "Australian girls are being hunted by online crime networks and coerced into acts of violence - against themselves, their siblings or pets - in a \"twisted type of gamification\", police have warned.A new taskforce has been set up to help global authorities tackle this \"new and disturbing front in traditional gender-based violence\", Australian Federal Police (AFP) Commissioner Krissy Barrett will say in a speech on Wednesday.Three people have already been arrested in Australia, and another nine people around the world.It is unclear what the acts being committed by targets are, but Ms Barrett says the alleged perpetrators hold violent extremist views and want to hurt people \"for fun\".Aged in their late teens or early 20s and largely from Western backgrounds, they recruit pre-teen or teenage girls through gaming platforms such as Roblox or messaging apps such as Discord and Telegram.The boys and men - whom Ms Barrett calls \"crimefluencers\" - subscribe to a variety of ideologies, including including nihilism, sadism, Nazism and satanism.\"These groups have a similar culture to multiplayer, online gaming culture, and hunt, stalk and draw in victims from a range of online platforms,\" she will say in the speech, also adding that they may not fully understand the consequences of their behaviour.\"The motivation of individuals within these networks is not financial nor is it for sexual gratification – this is purely for their amusement, for fun, or to be popular online.\"Almost 60 alleged offenders have been identified in Australia alone, Ms Barrett says, and the AFP is working with other Five Eyes nations - the US, UK, New Zealand and Canada - to target the groups.It comes as Australia prepares to introduce a world first social media ban for kids under the age of 16, aimed at minimising online harm. However gaming and messaging platforms are exempt from the new laws, which come into effect in December.",

    "body": "5 hours agoMimi SwabyGlobal affairs reporterAt least 64 people were killed in a police operation against the Red Command gang in Rio de Janeiro's northern suburbs - the largest and deadliest raid in the Brazilian state's history.Four police officers were among those killed during Operation Containment in the Alemão and Penha districts, state Governor Cláudio Castro said. More than 80 people were arrested.Fierce clashes erupted when about 2,500 security personnel moved in on Tuesday morning. The Red Command (Comando Vermelho) responded with gunfire, burning barricades and dropping bombs from drones, officials said. The UN Human Rights Office said it was \"horrified\" by the police operation, urging \"prompt and effective investigations\".The area of favelas near Rio's airport is considered to be the headquarters of one of Brazil's most powerful organised crime groups.State officials said at least 50 of those killed were \"indicated by police as suspected of being criminals\".Dozens of people were injured, including civilians caught in the crossfire.Locals have likened the hillside area - home to about 300,000 people - to a \"war zone\" since the operation began.Roads remain closed throughout the region.The Red Command group have been expanding their territory across the Rio state, increasing drug trafficking routes and control of the hillside favelas.Rio's police said more than 200kg (441lb) of drugs were seized in the raid, along with dozens of firearms.The joint operation by civil and military police comes after a year-long investigation.Dozens of the suspects are thought to be members of a faction from the Pará state who are currently hiding in Rio de Janeiro.Large-scale police operations are not uncommon in Brazil ahead of major international events in the South American nation. The UN climate summit COP30 is taking place in the northern city of Belem in November.",

    "body": "Most countries fail to submit new climate pledges ahead of summit17 hours agoMatt McGrathEnvironment correspondentGetty ImagesOnly 64 countries have submitted new plans to cut carbon, the UN says, despite all being required to do so ahead of next month's COP30 summit.Added together these national pledges would fail to keep the world from warming by more than 1.5C, a key threshold to very dangerous levels of climate change.While the UN review does show progress in curbing carbon emissions over the next decade, the projected fall is not enough to stop temperatures surging past this global target.The report underlines the scale of the task facing world leaders who head to Belém in northern Brazil next week for the COP30 climate gathering.Ten years after the Paris climate pact was agreed in 2015, the efforts of countries to restrict the rise in global temperatures are under renewed scrutiny.Every signatory agreed to submit a new carbon-cutting plan every five years, which would cover the next decade.But only 64 countries managed to put a new pledge in place this year, despite many extensions of the deadline. These represent around 30% of global emissions.In addition, the UN's review includes statements from China and the EU on their future plans made at Climate Week in New York in September.Taken together, the efforts mean that global emissions of carbon dioxide should fall by around 10% by 2035.However, scientists say that such a drop is nowhere near enough to keep the rise in temperatures under 1.5C.To keep that goal alive will require steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, up to 57% by 2035, according to the UN last year.\"This report shows that we are going in the right direction but too slowly,\" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation, often referred to as a key architect of the Paris Agreement.\"It is essential to acknowledge the missing national pledges and confront the persistent gap between ambition and actual implementation.\"The 1.5C limit, agreed at Paris, has long been seen as the threshold of very dangerous warming. In 2018, scientists outlined the massive benefits to the world of keeping the rise under 1.5C as compared to allowing them to rise to 2C. Passing 1.5C include more frequent and intense heatwaves and storms, increased damage to coral reefs and growing threats to human health and livelihoods, UN scientists have said.However, that limit was breached in 2024 for a whole year for the first time. UN leaders are increasingly accepting the fact that the threshold will be breached permanently by the early 2030s at current rates.Getty ImagesBrazil's President Lula visits Belém ahead of COP30 in November\"One thing is already clear: we will not be able to contain the global warming below 1.5C in the next few years,\" UN secretary general António Guterres told delegates at a meeting of the World Meteorological Organisation last week.\"Overshooting is now inevitable. Which means that we're going to have a period, bigger or smaller, with higher or lower intensity, above 1.5C in the years to come.\"Despite this, the UN is keen to stress that there are some significant green shoots in the new report that provide hope.Many more countries are expected to lodge plans as their leaders gather for COP30 in Belém in Brazil.Large carbon producers such as India and Indonesia haven't yet unveiled their carbon plans. They will likely do so during COP30 and these may have a significant impact on the overall projections for 2035.Some countries are also likely to cut faster and deeper than they've promised, say experts.\"It's actually completely reasonable to look at China,\" said Todd Stern, former US Special Envoy for climate change.\"They'll put down a certain number, which is not great, and then they will overachieve it, and China does that a lot.\"The UN says they are confident that emissions globally will likely peak and start to decline in the next few years, for the first time since the industrial revolution in the 19th century.They say the plans in place show clear stepping stones to net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. Net zero means balancing the amount of planet-warming \"greenhouse\" gases produced by human activities with the amount being actively removed from the atmosphere.One important factor is that the cuts assessed by the UN include the planned US pledge submitted under President Biden.While President Donald Trump has said he will pull out of the Paris agreement, that process is not completed yet, so the UN are keeping the US plans in their calculations even if these won't happen as planned.",

    "body": "A man accused of killing former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial.Tetsuya Yamagami, 45, told a court in the capital Tokyo that \"everything is true\", according to local media. Yamagami used a homemade gun to shoot Abe during a political campaign event in the western city of Nara in 2022.Abe - who was known for his hawkish foreign policy and a signature economic strategy that popularly came to be known as \"Abenomics\" - was struck several times, and died in hospital later the same day, sending shockwaves around the world.The assassination shone a spotlight on links between Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Unification Church, more popularly known as the \"Moonies\".Yamagami is reported to have told investigators he targeted Abe because he blamed the 67-year-old for allegedly promoting the church, which he said had bankrupted his mother and the wider family.He alleged his mother made donations, said to total about 100 million yen ($660,000), as proof of her faith to the church.The allegations prompted investigations into the church, which started in South Korea and is known for its mass weddings, and led to four ministers resigning.Then, in March this year, a Tokyo court ordered the disbandment of the church, stripping it of its tax exempt status and requiring it to liquidate its assets. But Yamagami's mother - who is expected to be called as a witness - has reportedly not wavered in her beliefs, telling Japanese media that the killing has made her faith stronger, according to the Japan Times.Yamagami's trial is not expected to conclude until January, with the defendant denying charges relating to violation of arms control laws. His lawyer told the court the homemade weapon did not fall into the correct category, Japan's NHK said.Japan, which has very low levels of gun violence, has further strengthened its laws around homemade guns since Abe's killing.",

    "body": "29 minutes agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterThe co-founder of ice cream maker Ben & Jerry's says that its parent company Unilever blocked it from launching an ice cream flavour that expressed \"solidarity with Palestine\".Ben Cohen announced that he will independently create the new flavour as part of a personal series highlighting causes the company has been barred from addressing publicly.Ben & Jerry's is known for its activism on social issues and has consistently spoken out on political, environmental and humanitarian matters - including the Israel-Gaza conflict.The BBC has contacted Unilever for comment.Mr Cohen's statement deepens the long-drawn dispute between the world-famous ice cream maker and Unilever, the British packaged goods giant which has owned Ben & Jerry's since 2000.The co-founders said Unilever and its ice cream arm Magnum, which is being spun off from its parent company, had unlawfully blocked their company from \"honouring its social mission\".Mr Cohen said in an Instagram video on Tuesday that he is creating a new watermelon-flavoured sorbet, calling for ideas for the product's name and what ingredients should be added.The watermelon has become a symbol for solidarity with Palestinians due to its colours, which are similar to those of the Palestinian flag – red, green, black and white. The American entrepreneur said Ben & Jerry's were prevented by Unilever from creating the dessert.\"I'm doing what they couldn't,\" Mr Cohen says from his set in a kitchen. \"I'm making a watermelon-flavoured ice cream that calls for permanent peace in Palestine and calls for repairing the damage that was done there.\"In 2021, Ben & Jerry's refused to sell its products in areas occupied by Israel. Its Israeli operation was sold by Unilever to a local licensee, allowing its ice cream to continue being sold in the occupied West Bank.The dessert series will be developed under Ben's Best, Mr Cohen's activist ice cream brand, he said in a statement to the press. The flavour is being produced independently of Ben & Jerry's, the statement said.Ben's Best was first setup in 2016 to support former US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, with the flavour \"Bernie's Back\". Mr Cohen said he will develop other ice cream flavours that speak to the issues Ben & Jerry's was silenced from addressing publicly by Unilever.In September, co-founder Jerry Greenfield stepped down from Ben & Jerry's after decades at the company, citing concerns that its independence had been compromised following Unilever's decision to curb its social activism.At the time, Ben Cohen said that \"Jerry has a really big heart and this conflict with Unilever was breaking it.\"\"My heart leads me to continue to work inside the company to advocate for its independence so that it can actualise the social mission, the values that it was founded on and has maintained for over 40 years,\" he told the BBC's PM programme.",

    "body": "2 hours agoPaul NjieBBC Africa, YaoundéCameroon's Interior Minister Paul Atanga Nji says opposition leader Issa Tchiroma Bakary will face legal action over allegations he incited \"violent post-election demonstrations\".  At least four protesters have been killed during clashes between security forces and opposition supporters since Cameroon's election on 12 October, with 92-year-old President Paul Biya winning an eighth consecutive term.Tchiroma Bakary insists he won the election, a claim dismissed by Biya's ruling party, the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM).Violent crackdowns by police and security officers on protesters have alarmed the international community, with the UN, African Union and EU calling for restraint.On Tuesday, Nji accused Tchiroma Bakary of organising what he said were \"illegal\" protests leading to the loss of lives, and also criticised him for declaring victory in the election.He added that Tchiroma Bakary's \"accomplices responsible for an insurrectionary plan\" will also face legal action.Paul Biya, who came to power in 1982 and is now the world's oldest head of state, won the 12 October election with 53.7% of the vote, compared to 35.2% for Tchiroma Bakary, according to Cameroon's Constitutional Council.Tchiroma Bakary is yet to respond to the government's decision to try him, but he had previously told the BBC that he would not accept a stolen vote - and that he was not afraid of being arrested.On election result day, he said armed men opened fire on protesters assembled near his residence in Garoua, fatally wounding at least two civilians.On Tuesday, the interior minister revealed that an investigation would be launched into violent incidents before and after the announcement of the election results.\"During these attacks, some of the criminals lost their lives,\" he said, without providing a specific number of protesters who have been killed in the clashes.Nji added that several members of the security forces also sustained serious injuries.Although Nji insisted the situation nationwide was now under control, protesters remain active in some parts of the country, especially in Douala and Garoua, where demonstrators mounted roadblocks on Tuesday, and burnt tyres on the streets.Analysts warn the post-electoral violence could plunge the country into a political crisis.Additional reporting by Natasha Booty and Michel Mvondo",

    "body": "10 hours agoLaura Gozzi,London and Abdujalil Abdurasulov,WarsawRussian troops are making a concerted push in eastern Ukraine and have gained a foothold in the strategic hub of Pokrovsk, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says. Moscow's soldiers outnumber Kyiv's 8-1 in the area and Ukraine cannot match that, Zelensky added while insisting Russia had not yet \"achieved the planned result\". Russia has been trying to capture Pokrovsk for two years. The key supply and transport hub provides supplies and reinforcements to the eastern front - and it would get Moscow closer to occupying the entirety of the Donetsk region. It would also put towns of the heavily fortified \"fortress belt\" - Kramatorsk, Slovyansk, Kostyantynivka and Druzhkivka - within easier reach of Moscow. Zelensky said drone imagery showed that around 200 Russian soldiers were inside Pokrovsk. Describing the situation as \"difficult\", he said earlier that there was widespread fierce fighting and \"sabotage groups\" had entered the town. However, he rejected reports by Russia's Chief of General Staff, Gen Valery Gerasimov, that Ukrainian troops had been completely surrounded. In an update on Tuesday, Russia's defence ministry said its forces had encircled Ukrainian troops around the main railway station and cleared the city's Troyanda district of Ukrainian forces.One soldier from Ukraine's 155th Brigade, Artem Pribylnov, rejected the notion that Ukrainian troops had been encircled in a \"cauldron\" at Pokrovsk.\"But the war has changed and it's very technological now,\" he said. In previous assaults there had been a path out of the cauldron that troops could drive in and out of, he said, but now drones controlled access points, which made it \"extremely dangerous\".\"Perhaps that's why Russians claim they've encircled Pokrovsk even if there is no physical encirclement of the city?\" he suggested.According to Capt Hryhoriy Shapoval, spokesperson of Ukraine's East operational group, 79 attacks had been repelled near Pokrovsk since Monday - almost a third of the total 218 assaults recorded across the entire front line.He said that Russian troops had concentrated a large number of troops and equipment near Pokrovsk and that they were using armoured vehicles to cover their infantry. \"So it's hard to stop them,\" he said.He added that Kyiv's troops normally used drones to counter the Russians' advance but foggy and rainy weather conditions had made it harder to detect and destroy infantry troops.The situation in and around Pokrovsk exemplifies the high cost of shifting the front line forward, even just by a few metres. Last week, Ukrainian media reported that Russian forces were engaging in street battles and targeting Ukrainian positions, including drone operators.Away from the towns, drone technology means both Russian and Ukrainian forces are able to pound one another deep on either side of the front line.Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 is almost into its fifth year. Moscow's troops currently occupy about 20% of Ukrainian territory. Kyiv's defence capabilities are shrinking and Zelensky has said Ukraine needs  financial support from its European allies to continue fighting Russian forces for another two or three years. European leaders have so far failed to divert €140bn worth of Russian frozen assets to Ukraine - a move which would require complex legal machinations and which was blocked by Belgium at an EU summit last week. The proposal will be revisited in December.Zelensky said he had told his European counterparts that while Ukraine was \"not going to fight for decades... you must show that for some time you will be able to provide stable financial support to Ukraine\".The Ukrainian president also said he hoped a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday would result in a decision by China to cut its support for Russia. Last week Trump slapped Lukoil and Rosneft - two major Russian oil companies - with sanctions, and urged Turkey and China to halt purchases of Russian oil in a bid to put economic pressure on the Kremlin.\"I think this may be one of [Trump's] strong moves, especially if, following this decisive sanctions step, China is ready to reduce imports\" from Russia, Zelensky told journalists earlier this week.",

    "body": "A statue of a Confederate general that was torn down and set on fire in 2020 during social justice protests in Washington has been reinstalled under orders from President Donald Trump. General Albert Pike's statue has long been a source of controversy, as have many Confederate monuments across the US which were erected decades after the Civil War.The National Park Service announced in August its plan to return the refurbished statue, after Trump signed an executive order called \"Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History\".Democratic Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents the District of Columbia, called the restoration  “offensive to members of the military who serve honorably”.On Monday afternoon,  videos showed the area surrounding Pike's statue in Washington with a sign that read  \"Area close. Historic preservation work in progress\". \"The restoration aligns with federal responsibilities under historic-preservation law and recent executive orders to beautify the nation’s capital and restore pre-existing statues,\"  the National Park Service in a statement.These confederate statues caused US protests. Knocked down, they're the centre of a new art showThe statue, which was built in 1901, has been a source of controversy for many years. Members of local government have been calling for its removal for decades. Holmes Norton, a long-time critic, has introduced legislation to remove the Pike statue permanently multiple times. \"Pike himself served dishonourably,\" she said in a statement after the statue was restored. \"He took up arms against the United States, misappropriated funds, and was ultimately captured and imprisoned by his own troops.\"\"Confederate statues should be placed in museums as historical artifacts, not remain in parks or other locations that imply honor,\" Holmes Norton added. Pike's statue was the only monument to a Confederate general in the nation's capital before it was pulled down in 2020.Pike was a longtime leader of the Freemasons, a centuries-old secretive society, who paid for the statue. His body is interred at the Washington headquarters of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, which also contains a small museum in his honour.Pike's critics have accused him of being instrumental in the formation of the Ku Klux Klan. Masons insist that evidence doesn't support the allegations.The plaque that previously labelled the statue read \"author, poet, scholar, soldier, jurist, orator, philanthropist and philosopher\". Anti-racism protesters used ropes and chains to pull down the Pike statue following the murder of  George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of a police officer in 2020.Then-President Trump, in his first term, condemned the toppling on Twitter, writing: \"The DC police are not doing their job as they watched a statue be ripped down and burn. These people should be immediately arrested. A disgrace to our country.\"Floyd's death ignited a nationwide reckoning with systemic racism, prompting widespread calls to remove Confederate monuments. Ultimately, more than 300 such memorials were taken down across the country.Since returning to the White House, Trump has ordered statues and paintings of Confederate generals to be reinstalled. ",

    "body": "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is suing the makers of Tylenol, claiming the companies hid alleged dangers that the drug posed to children's brain development. The lawsuit comes a month after President Donald Trump promoted an unproven link between taking Tylenol - also known as paracetamol - during pregnancy and autism in children.  Paxton is suing Johnson & Johnson, which previously sold the drug, the only pain reliever recommended for pregnant women, and Kenvue, which now manufacturers it.  In a statement, he said they \"betrayed America by profiting off of pain and pushing pills regardless of the risks.\"Kenvue says there is no credible evidence tying Tylenol to autism.\"These corporations lied for decades, knowingly endangering millions to line their pockets,\" Paxton, a Republican, said.Kenvue said in a statement that it was \"deeply concerned by the perpetuation of misinformation on the safety of acetaminophen and the potential impact that could have on the health of American women and children\".On its website, Kenvue also said it had \"continuously evaluated the relevant science and there is no credible data that shows a proven link between taking acetaminophen and autism\". Organizations representing doctors and healthcare providers agree. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has said acetaminophen - the main ingredient in Tylenol - is one of the few options for pregnant women to treat pain and fever, which can pose serious health risks if left untreated. \"In more than two decades of research on the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy, not a single reputable study has successfully concluded that the use of acetaminophen in any trimester of pregnancy causes neurodevelopmental disorders in children,\" the group said. The lawsuit cites recent announcements from the Trump administration in arguing the drug is allegedly unsafe.Last month, Trump raised alarms from public health officials when he told pregnant women to \"fight like hell\" not to take Tylenol when ill. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) then issued a notice that doctors should consider limiting the use of Tylenol, while also stating that \"a causal relationship\" between the drug and autism in children has not been established. Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, who oversees the FDA, had pledged in April to undertake \"a massive testing and research effort\" that would determine the cause of autism in a matter of months. But experts cautioned that finding a single cause of autism - thought by researchers to be the result of a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors - would not be simple. Autism is a form of lifelong neurodivergence and disability that affects how people experience and interact with the world, and is diagnosed using doctors' observations.In his court filing, Paxton - a Trump ally who is running for US Senate - alleges Kenvue and Johnson & Johnson \"willfully ignored and attempted to silence the science\" around acetaminophen and autism. The lawsuit seeks to make the companies \"destroy any marketing or advertising\" that claims Tylenol is safe for pregnant women. The Texas lawsuit echoes the complaints of a group of parents of children with autism and ADHD who sued the makers of Tylenol in 2022.  A federal judge dismissed the case, saying research from the parents' expert witnesses was not conclusive. ",

Indian law allows children above 14 years to work in some industries which are seen as non-hazardous.Aarish is among hundreds of children and young adults from at least five states across northern India who have suffered serious eye injuries from using the same kind of device - called \"carbide guns\" - during Diwali.The \"carbide gun\", a rudimentary device, using calcium carbide in a plastic pipe, gives dramatic results  - a loud blast that sounds like a gunshot, accompanied by fiery sparks. But the explosion is unpredictable and often delayed - officials told the BBC that many of the injuries occurred when children peeped inside the pipe to check just as the blast happened.The sale and purchase of calcium carbide is regulated in India, but farmers and shopkeepers often use it to artificially ripen fruit. Police officials also say the crude guns are sometimes used to scare away animals from fields.But many in India had not heard of these guns until last week, when a spate of injuries was reported after Diwali. Officials said these devices began flooding local markets in northern India after viral social media videos showed them being used as firecrackers.Karan, 14, went through surgery at Hamidia Hospital in BhopalMore than 100 cases of carbide gun-related eye injuries have been reported in Madhya Pradesh's Bhopal district alone, with at least 15 requiring surgery. Another 100 cases have been reported from three other districts. In Bihar state, 170 cases have been reported, with 40 requiring surgery, says Dr Bibhuti Prassan Sinha, who heads the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology in Patna city. The actual numbers are likely to be higher, he added.Cases have also been reported from the states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, as well as capital Delhi. Some states, including Madhya Pradesh, have now banned the use of carbide guns as firecrackers and several sellers have been arrested.Kavitha Kumar, head of ophthalmology at Hamidia Hospital in Bhopal, says that patients have been coming in with mild, moderate and severe eye injuries.\"In milder cases, skin on the eye and around it has sustained chemical injuries and thermal burns. In moderate cases, chemical particulate matter has caused mild damage to the cornea and in severe cases, there's extensive damage to the cornea, causing temporary vision loss. With surgery, the patient may be able to regain their sight over time,\" she says. Some doctors told the BBC that they were shocked by the severity of the injuries. Dr Aditi Dubey from Hamidia Hospital said that she had never seen chemical injuries caused by Diwali firecrackers and had to research what \"carbide guns\" were.Many patients said that they bought the gun after seeing it on Instagram Reels and YouTube videos. An attractive aspect was the price - at 150-200 rupees ($1.70-$2; £1.28-£1.70) a piece, it was a relatively cheap firecracker that promised to make a big impact.A search for the term \"carbide gun\" on Instagram and YouTube throws up dozens of videos of young people making and using these devices, often accompanied by rap music. Carbide guns began popping up in local markets in the weeks before DiwaliSome accounts have also termed these videos \"science experiments\" with hashtags like \"useful project\" and \"experiment video\".Dr Sinha told the BBC that one of his patients was an engineering student who made the gun at home after watching such videos. He's currently being treated after losing vision in one of his eyes.Calcium carbide is a regulated substance in India - its possession, use and manufacturing are controlled by law because of its harmful effects and potential for abuse.When it comes in contact with water, it produces acetylene gas, which is highly flammable and has damaging properties on health.Under the Calcium Carbide Rules, 1987, a licence is needed for its sale, purchase and storage - but only for quantities above 200kg.A government official in Bhopal who didn't want to be named told the BBC that calcium carbide is still widely used to artificially ripen fruit despite a federal ban as it contains traces of poisonous substances.Alzain and his mother, Afreen, at Hamidia HospitalHarinarayanachari Mishra, Police Commissioner of Bhopal, told the BBC that carbide guns are also used in northern India during wedding festivities and by farmers to drive away monkeys.Dr Partha Biswas, president of the All India Ophthalmological Society, says carbide guns should be banned urgently.\"It's a national problem. And the seriousness of these incidents shouldn't be minimised as mere \"accidents\" that took place during the Diwali festival,\" he says.He adds that there's potential for these guns to be used as firecrackers during other festivals and events, like when India wins a cricket match or during New Year.\"These crude 'carbide bombs' or 'carbide guns' can cause permanent blindness, disfigurement and disability,\" he says, demanding a nationwide crackdown on manufacturers and sellers of the guns as well as more control over the supply chain of calcium carbide.Back at Hamidia Hospital, Alzain, whose left eye was operated on after he lost his vision, sits inside the tight embrace of his mother. The seven-year-old had pestered his uncle to buy the gun after watching videos on YouTube. Alzain's worried mother, Afreen, hasn't left his bedside since he was admitted a week ago.\"I'm scared for his future,\" she says. \"I hope he's able to see again.\"",

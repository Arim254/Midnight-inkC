    "body": "3 hours agoVikas Pandey,in Goa,Devina Gupta,in Delhi,andHarry SekulichWatch: BBC reports from scene of deadly Goa nightclub fireA fire at a popular nightclub in India's coastal region of Goa has killed 25 people, local officials say. Police had initially thought a gas cylinder in the Birch nightclub's kitchen exploded – but the region's chief minister said on Sunday that this had been ruled out and that indoor fireworks were now thought to be the cause of the blaze.The venue, located near a popular beach, was packed with revellers who had come to hear a Bollywood DJ. Four members of the same Delhi family and 21 staff died, police said.Four people have been arrested, including the nightclub's manager, and an arrest warrant for the owner has also been issued.Goa is a former Portuguese colony on the Arabian Sea. Its nightlife, sandy beaches, and resorts attract millions of tourists annually.Eyewitnesses told the BBC of scenes of panic in the bustling nightlife area.One said that he had been outside the club on what was a usual Saturday night with holidaymakers enjoying themselves when he heard screams.\"I didn't initially understand what was going on,\" he said. \"In a bit, it became clear that a massive fire had broken out. The scenes were just horrific.\" Though the main entrance is wide, the crossing over a small lake leading to the main structure is narrow and that made it difficult for firefighters to reach the spot.The BBC saw what appeared to be melted remains of chairs, tables and plants in one corner of the club.EPAPolice believe a gas cylinder exploded in the club's kitchen, causing a blaze to rip through the venueGoa's chief minister Pramod Sawant told journalists three people had died from burns, while most of the others had died of suffocation. Six people are in a stable condition in hospital.Officials said 20 of the workers who died were from the Indian states of Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Karnataka. One worker was from Nepal.A chef who works at a nearby venue told the BBC he knew some of the workers at the Birch club.\"People from all over the country and also from Nepal work in different clubs in Goa,\" he said.\"I am really worried for some people who I knew at the club. Their phones are off.On Sunday, emergency teams were combing through the charred wreckage.An inquiry into the cause of the fire has been launched, Sawant said, and a full report into the incident will be released within a week.\"Those found responsible will face most stringent action under the law – any negligence will be dealt with firmly,\" Dr Sawant added.India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the Goa fire \"deeply saddening\" in a post on social media.A rescue operation and investigation was ongoing at the Goa nightclub on Sunday morningAbout 5.5 million tourists visited Goa in the first half of the year, government data showed, with 270,000 coming from abroad.Some opposition politicians told the BBC that stricter regulations were needed to avoid such tragedies.They alleged that newer clubs were opening too frequently and the government needed to ensure they were safe for people to visit.India has seen a number of deadly fires at entertainment venues in recent years.A fire at a three-storey building killed 17 in the southern city of Hyderabad in May, while a hotel blaze in north-east Kolkata left 15 dead a month earlier.Last year, 24 died at an amusement park arcade in the western state of Gujarat after visitors were trapped inside. An official review later found poor safety standards contributed to the death toll.here.",

    "body": "A drone attack on the town of Kalogi, in Sudan's South Kordofan region, is said to have hit a kindergarten and killed at least 50 people, including 33 children. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the paramilitary group battling the army in Sudan's civil war, was accused of Thursday's attack by a medical organisation, the Sudan Doctors' Network, and the army.There was no immediate comment from the RSF. The RSF in turn accused the army of hitting a market on Friday in a drone attack in the Darfur region, on a fuel depot at the Adre border crossing with Chad.Sudan has been ravaged by war since April 2023 when a power struggle broke out between the RSF and the army, who were formerly allies .The reports could not be verified independently.   According to the army-aligned foreign ministry, the kindergarten was struck twice with missiles from drones.Civilians and medics who rushed to the school were also attacked, it added.Responding to reports of the attack in Kalogi, a spokesman for the UN children's agency Unicef said: \"Killing children in their school is a horrific violation of children's rights.\"\"Children should never pay the price of conflict,\" Sheldon Yett added.The agency, he said, urged \"all parties to stop these attacks immediately and allow safe, unhindered access for humanitarian assistance to reach those in desperate need\".The RSF accused the army of attacking the Adre crossing because it was used for the \"delivery of aid and commercial supplies\". According to the Sudan War Monitor, a group of researchers tracking the conflict, the attack caused civilian casualties and significant damage to a market.The military did not immediately comment on the reports from Darfur.Wedged between Sudan's capital Khartoum and Darfur, the region made up of North Kordofan, South Kordofan and West Kordofan has been a frontline in the civil war.The battle for the Kordofans - which have a population of almost eight million - has intensified as the army pushes towards Darfur.",

    "body": "A protective shield covering the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in Ukraine can no longer provide its main containment function following a drone strike earlier this year, according to a UN watchdog.  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors found that the massive structure, built over the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster, had lost its \"primary safety functions including the confinement capability\".In February, Ukraine accused Russia of targeting the power plant - a claim the Kremlin denied.The IAEA said repairs were \"essential\" to \"prevent further degradation\" of the nuclear shelter. However environmental expert Jim Smith told the BBC: \"It is not something to panic about.\"Prof Smith from the University of Portsmouth in the UK, who has studied the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster, said the biggest danger linked to the site was disturbing radioactive dust.But he said that \"the risk is low\" because contaminated dust is contained within a thick concrete \"sarcophagus\" which is covered by the protective shield. The 1986 explosion at Chernobyl blasted radioactive material into the air, triggering a public health emergency across Europe.In response, the former Soviet Union constructed the sarcophagus over the nuclear reactor. The sarcophagus only had a 30-year lifespan, prompting the need for the protective shell to prevent radioactive material leaking out over the next 100 years.The IAEA said a team had completed a safety assessment of the site last week after it was \"severely damaged\" by the drone strike. The attack caused a fire in the outer cladding of the steel structure.Inspectors said there was no permanent damage to shell's load-bearing structures or monitoring systems and some repairs had been carried out on the roof.But IAEA director general Rafael Grossi, said: \"Timely and comprehensive restoration remains essential to prevent further degradation and ensure long-term nuclear safety.\"Since the beginning of December, the UN's nuclear watchdog has been assessing Ukraine's energy infrastructure as the country continues to defend itself against Russia.Overnight, Russia launched airstrikes on the city of Kremenchuk, a major industrial hub in the centre of Ukraine. As well as assessing Chernobyl, the IAEA has been inspecting electrical substations linked to nuclear safety and security.Mr Grossi said: \"They are absolutely indispensable for providing the electricity all nuclear power plants need for reactor cooling and other safety systems.\"They are also needed to distribute the electricity that they produce to households and industry.\"",

    "body": "A National Guardsman is on the mend after he was critically injured in an ambush-style shooting last month in Washington DC. The parents of Andrew Wolfe, 24, say \"his head wound is slowly healing and that he's beginning to 'look more like himself'\", said West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey. The family expects the Air Force staff sergeant to be in acute care for the next two to three weeks, and they feel optimistic about his progress, Morrisey said in a statement.Staff Sgt Wolfe was one of two West Virginia National Guard members shot when a gunman opened fire not far from the White House on 26 November. His colleague, 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom, died from her injuries. \"We continue to ask all West Virginians and Americans for their prayers!\" the governor said in his statement. Morrisey attended a vigil on Friday evening for Staff Sgt Wolfe at Musselman High School in Inwood, West Virginia, where the guardsman was once a student.A pastor at the vigil read a message from the soldier's parents, Jason and Melody Wolfe.\"We know that there is a long road to go,\" they wrote, according to local news outlet Metro News. \"But our faith keeps us hopeful. We remain grateful for the prayers and the support from people all over the world.\"Earlier in the week, the governor said Staff Sgt Wolfe had responded to a nurse with a thumbs-up and was able to move his toes.Police have charged the suspected shooter, an Afghan national named Rahmanullah Lakanwal, with first-degree murder and assault with intent to kill.Before coming to the US in 2021, he was once a counterterrorism soldier in a CIA-backed unit that worked with American troops in Afghanistan.Staff Sgt Wolfe was one of 2,000 National Guard members whom President Donald Trump deployed to the nation's capitol in August as part of his immigration and crime-related crackdown in Democratic-led cities. Following the shooting, Trump said he wanted another 500 National Guard troops sent to the nation's capital. The Trump administration has also cited the shooting as a reason for additional immigration crackdown measures.They have cancelled all citizenship ceremonies for immigrants from 19 countries that were part of a travel ban announced over the summer, including Afghanistan.

    "body": "Russia has welcomed US President Donald Trump's new National Security Strategy, calling it \"largely consistent\" with Moscow's vision. The 33-page document, unveiled by the US administration this week, suggests Europe is facing \"civilisational erasure\" and does not cast Russia as a threat to the US. Combatting foreign influence, ending mass migration, and rejecting the EU's perceived practice of \"censorship\" are mentioned as other priorities in the report. Several EU officials and analysts had pushed back on the strategy, questioning its focus on freedom of expression and likening it to language used by the Kremlin. \"The adjustments we're seeing... are largely consistent with our vision,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in an interview published by Russia's state news agency Tass on Sunday. \"We consider this a positive step,\" he said, adding that Moscow would continue to analyse the document before drawing strong conclusions. The strategy adopts a softer language towards Russia, which EU officials worry could weaken its stance towards Moscow as it pushes for an end to the war in Ukraine. In the document, the EU is blamed for blocking US efforts to end the conflict and says that the US must \"re-establish strategic stability to Russia\" which would \"stabilise European economies\".It appears to endorse efforts to influence policy on the continent, noting that US policy should prioritise \"resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations\".The new report also calls for the restoration of \"Western identity\", and claims that Europe will be \"unrecognisable in 20 years or less\" and its economic issues are \"eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilisational erasure\".\"It is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies,\" the document states.In stark contrast, the document celebrates the influence of \"patriotic European parties\" and says \"America encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit\".As the EU engages in ongoing talks with the Trump administration to set out a peace deal in Ukraine, some officials emphasised their lasting relationship with the US, while raising \"questions\" over the document. \"The US will remain our most important ally in the [Nato] alliance. This alliance, however, is focused on addressing security policy issues,\" German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Friday. \"I believe questions of freedom of expression or the organisation of our free societies do not belong [in the strategy], in any case at least when it comes to Germany.\"In a social media post addressed to his \"American friends\", Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that \"Europe is your closest ally, not your problem\" and noted their \"common enemies\".\"This is the only reasonable strategy of our common security. Unless something has changed.\"Meanwhile, former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt wrote that the document \"places itself to the right of the extreme right\".The US has been growing closer to the far-right AfD party in Germany, which has been classified as extreme right by German intelligence.Promoting an \"America First\" message, the strategy says the US intends to target alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean, considering possible military action in Venezuela.The US also calls on an increased defence spending from Japan, South Korea, Australia and Taiwan.Democrats in Congress warned that the document could shatter US foreign relations. Representative Jason Crow of Colorado, who sits on House committees overseeing intelligence and the armed forces, called the strategy \"catastrophic to America's standing in the world\".New York Representative Gregory Meeks said it \"discards decades of value-based, US leadership\".",

    "body": "Russian air strikes on Ukraine have continued overnight, hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had a \"very constructive\" phone call with Donald Trump's negotiating team following three days of talks in Florida.Early on Sunday the mayor of Kremenchuk, a major industrial hub in central Ukraine, said the city had been repeatedly struck in a \"massive\" attack. No deaths have been confirmed so far.Meanwhile, Russia said it had shot down 77 Ukrainian drones in several locations.Aerial assaults have persisted even as efforts to negotiate an end to the war have intensified, including detailed Ukraine-US talks in Miami aimed at drafting a peace settlement acceptable to both sides.Zelensky said on Saturday that he was \"determined\" to continue working with the US after speaking to Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the US president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, at the conclusion of those negotiations. He added that they had discussed how to ensure Russia stuck to any potential deal to end the war.Hours later, Kremenchuk Mayor Vitaliy Maletsk said his city had sustained a \"massive combined strike\" on its infrastructure. The extent of the damage was unclear as of Sunday morning but the mayor said water, electricity and heating had been cut off for some.The city, which is roughly halfway between Kyiv and the frontline in the east, has been repeatedly targeted since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.The White House has pushed Kyiv and Moscow to agree to a multi-point plan to end the war but there has been little sign of a breakthrough, despite both sides engaging with the US-led process.\"Ukraine is determined to keep working in good faith with the American side to genuinely achieve peace,\" Zelensky said on X. \"We covered many aspects and went through key points that could ensure an end to the bloodshed and eliminate the threat of a new Russian full scale invasion.\"The Russian strikes in the early hours of Sunday followed a wider attack 24 hours earlier, which drew condemnation from Kyiv's European allies.In a social media post, French President Emmanuel Macron said he had spoken to Zelensky and offered his \"full solidarity\". \"France is determined to work with all partners to secure de-escalation measures and to impose a ceasefire,\" Macron added. Macron, Zelensky, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are due to hold in-person talks in London on Monday.European leaders have pushed back against early versions of the US-led peace plan and have sought to win support from the White House for their own proposals, such as comprehensive security guarantees for a post-war Ukraine, including the possibility of a peacekeeping force.Sir Keir has led the push for a so-called \"coalition of the willing\", a loose collection of Ukrainian allies who are committed to continuing to underwrite Kyiv's defence in the event of a ceasefire to deter a second invasion. He has called that proposal \"vital\" for Ukraine's long-term security.Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected the idea of such a force, saying any troops deployed to Ukraine would be \"legitimate targets\".Also on Saturday, US and Ukrainian negotiators urged Russia to show a \"serious commitment to long-term peace\".The joint statement was issued days after Witkoff returned from talks with Putin at the Kremlin which failed to produce a breakthrough.Witkoff and Rustem Umerov, newly installed as Zelensky's most senior negotiator, said they had \"agreed on the framework of security arrangements\" and \"discussed necessary deterrence capabilities to sustain a lasting peace\".",

    "body": "The death toll in Indonesia from recent flooding has passed 900, with hundreds still missing.More than 100,000 homes were destroyed when a rare and powerful cyclone formed over the Malaca Strait last week, bringing torrential rain and landslides to parts of the South East Asian country.Efforts to reach people in areas still cut off are ongoing, with aid having to be airdropped into some places.The Indonesia floods were one of several extreme weather events to hit Asia in recent weeks, with the cumulative death toll in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam approaching 2,000. In Aceh Tamiang, one of the hardest-hit areas of Indonesia, survivors described villages being entirely swept away by fast-moving deluges.One survivor in Lintang Bawah Village told the BBC Indonesian service that people survived by sitting on top of their homes.Fitriana said: \"There were also those who survived on the roofs of their houses with their four-year-old children, for three days without eating or drinking.\"She said around 90% of the homes in her village were destroyed, leaving 300 families with nowhere to go.One man recounted how he and his family were evacuated by boat when the floodwaters inundated his home up to the second floor, only for them to need to flee again from a nearby village.He said: \"That night, while we were sleeping, water suddenly soaked the mattresses we were sleeping on [in Gampoeng Dalam Village]. But we couldn't go anywhere else, because there was no higher ground.\"Luckily, my daughter-in-law's house was on two levels. So we climbed upstairs and that's where we survived.\"The region's governor said response teams were still searching for bodies in \"waist-deep\" mud, according to the AFP news agency. He said: \"Many people need basic necessities. Many areas remain untouched in the remote areas of Aceh.\"People are not dying from the flood, but from starvation. That's how it is.\"Indonesian media reported inmates were released from one prison when floodwaters threatened to engulf the facility, with officials saying there was nowhere else for them to be sent.Land access to two areas, Sibolga City and Central Tapanuli, remained cut off as of Sunday, with aid only able to reach them by air and sea respectively. There have been reports of looting at supermarkets in some areas.",

    "body": "2 hours agoTessa WongSingaporeGetty ImagesHongkongers are mourning the worst blaze the city has seen in more than 70 yearsHongkongers have voted in an election seen as a test of public sentiment following a deadly fire that angered some in the city. The government mounted a huge campaign to encourage residents to choose members of the Legislative Council (LegCo). All of the candidates have been vetted to ensure they are loyal to China.Voter turnout was 31.9%, according to the city's electoral office. The last election in 2021 saw the administrative region's lowest-ever turnout of 30% amid widespread voter apathy.This election took place as many were mourning a devastating fire in Hong Kong's Tai Po district last month that killed nearly 160 people.Around 1.3 million voted out of around 4.1 million registered voters in the city, which has a population of more than seven million. China earlier made sweeping changes to Hong Kong's electoral system to ensure only \"patriots\" could run for seats. Beijing has said the changes, which were put in place after anti-government protests in 2019, were necessary to ensure stability in Hong Kong, but critics say they weakened democracy.Ahead of the recent election, authorities distributed aid to survivors of the Tai Po fire, arrested suspects and sought to improve building safety, as some Hongkongers raised questions about the incident.A total of 161 candidates competed for 90 seats in the LegCo, which acts as a mini parliament and can make and amend laws. Twenty of those are directly elected, while nearly half are picked by the pro-Beijing Election Committee and the rest chosen by special interest groups like business and trade.This year, the government has blanketed the city with posters urging Hongkongers to head to the polls, while dangling freebies and shopping discounts.After casting their vote, each person received a \"thank you card\" that could be redeemed for vouchers in selected shops and restaurants, or for beauty services, medical check-ups and insurance policy premiums.Authorities also offered free entry to public swimming pools and museums on polling day, organising carnivals in various neighbourhoods, and holding a televised variety show and gala. They have also created cartoon mascots and a theme tune for the election, adapted from a 2001 hit song by Cantopop star Aaron Kwok, called \"Let's Vote, Together We Create The Future\".Hong Kong's Chief Secretary Eric Chan told reporters last month that the measures were aimed at ensuring \"a happy and festive mood\" and to \"let residents recognise the importance of the election\".VCG via Getty ImagesThe Hong Kong government has launched a campaign urging residents to voteBut in recent days focus has been on the 26 November fire that engulfed high-rise residential blocks at Wang Fuk Court in the northerly suburban district of Tai Po.The blaze was the worst seen in Hong Kong in more than 70 years. The death toll, which currently stands at 159, is likely to rise further as officials continue to recover bodies.As Hong Kong mourns its dead, some are asking whether the fire could have been prevented and questioning building safety standards. Many Hongkongers live in ageing high-rise buildings similar to Wang Fuk Court.Authorities have since ordered the creation of an independent committee to investigate the cause of the fire, and have arrested 13 people on suspicion of manslaughter. They have also ordered the removal of scaffolding mesh used in all building renovations across the city. Investigators have found that a scaffolding mesh used for renovations in Wang Fuk Court failed to meet flame retardant standards - and that the fire spread quickly due to the mesh and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings.Authorities have also moved quickly to quell dissent. Police have reportedly detained a man, who was part of a group petitioning for an independent inquiry, for suspected sedition on Saturday. The petition was also wiped from the internet.Two other people, including a former district councillor, were also taken in by police.VCG via Getty ImagesHong Kong has been blanketed with posters for the Legco electionPolitical campaigning for the LegCo election was immediately suspended following the fire, though government-organised debate forums resumed after a few days. Carnivals organised for the election campaign were also cancelled.Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee insisted the LegCo election continued as planned as \"we must move forward before we can turn our grief into strength\".He said that the new legislators would be able to quickly support reconstruction and reforms.John P Burns, an emeritus professor and Chinese politics expert at the University of Hong Kong, said he believed the government would interpret a high turnout as a sign that voters perceive Hong Kong's reshaped political system as \"relatively legitimate\".But he expected the numbers to be low, in part due to the Tai Po fire.He pointed out that most Hongkongers have traditionally supported the pan-democrat opposition - which have effectively been barred from taking part. \"I think they won't be convinced to participate this time, just as they mostly stayed away in 2021.\"Mobilising pro-establishment voters following the fire would be difficult for the government as well, he added.Some in that camp will be impressed by how authorities have speedily re-housed those made homeless in the fire and the aid authorities have provided, \"which by any measure has been rapid and relatively generous\", noted Prof Burns.But others may have stayed away from the polls as they were \"disappointed, even angry, by the governance problems the fire has exposed\", he said.Hong Kong's national security office this week reposted a commentary from a pro-Beijing news outlet that urged residents to vote to show support for government's reconstruction efforts.\"Building a good future together starts with this vote. If you truly love Hong Kong, you should sincerely vote,\" the commentary said.This year's LegCo election featured a number of new faces, with about a quarter of the incumbent lawmakers stepping down.Local media reports that Beijing pressured several lawmakers to retire as it had unofficially set an age limit. A number of those stepping down are aged above 70, including the prominent politician Regina Ip, a former security chief nicknamed the \"Iron Lady\".",

    "body": "Image source, BBC Weather Watchers / MoxleyByChris Fawkes Lead Weather PresenterWitnessing a dazzling display of the Northern Lights with vivid sheets of colour dancing across the night sky is a real treat for those lucky enough to be in the right place at just the right time. But the charged particles hurled into space by our tempestuous Sun - the particles that create the aurora borealis - can also unleash very rare but extremely disruptive events here on Earth. Electricity supplies, satellites and air travel can all be affected by the most violent solar storms.Recently 6,000 planes were grounded by Airbus, requiring a software update after one of their planes experienced a \"sudden drop in altitude\" in October thought to be caused by interference from intense solar radiation.This kind of disruption is something that scientists and governments are actively researching and planning for.What damage can solar storms cause?The UK government publishes The National Risk Register, external - a list of serious hazards that could affect the country at some point in the future. It catalogues the sorts of nightmare scenarios that give politicians sleepless nights.Alongside risks such as nuclear incidents, terrorist attacks and outbreaks of disease sits the threat of severe space weather.Image source, Nasa/Goddard/SDO/PA WireImage caption, A photo of a solar flare on the left side of the Sun hurling charged particles into spaceMuch of the planning for a severe space weather is based on the Carrington Event of 1859, the most intense geomagnetic storm in recorded history.  This created rapid variations in the Earth's magnetic field that caused electricity to be generated in long wires. Telegraph operators suffered electric shocks, pylons were seen to spark and some conversations between operators could carry on while batteries were disconnected. All this happened a long time ago, but with today's advanced technologies the effects of a similar event would be far more disruptive.Satellites can be badly affected. Strong solar storms can cause the Earth's atmosphere to expand out into space, which creates more drag for satellites. This can cause them to slow down enough for some to deorbit and fall back to Earth. This is not just a theoretical risk - in February 2022 a solar storm led to the loss of 38 satellites, external.Orbital changes of satellites also increase the risk of collision and space weather can also play havoc with sensitive electronics on board, causing malfunctions.Radio communications can be badly impacted with GPS systems lost or disrupted for many days - so your car sat-nav could stop working, creating gridlock in cities. Image caption, A major solar storm could cause chaos for drivers relying on sat-nav to get aroundWithout GPS a plane's ability to operate safely would be compromised – meaning air travel would be big casualty too.Space weather has already been blamed for affecting aviation electronics. On 30 October 2025 a JetBlue Airlines Airbus A320 plane flying between Cancun (Mexico) and Newark (USA) suddenly and unexpectedly lost altitude, resulting in injuries to some passengers. The plane diverted to Florida with 15 passengers taken to hospital for treatment. Airbus investigated this incident and found that space weather had corrupted data in an elevator aileron computer which sends commands to the plane's flaps. In this case it caused the plane to unexpectedly pitch down. An Emergency Airworthiness Directive, external (EAD) was issued, grounding more than 6,000 planes until a software update was installed or computers upgraded. Bad as this incident was, it could have been catastrophic.The EAD states that \"in the worst-case scenario an uncommanded elevator movement may result in exceeding the aircraft's structural capability\".Image source, Bill Clarke/Getty ImagesImage caption, A JetBlue Airlines Airbus A320 landing in Washington DC.Electricity grids can also fail, causing power cuts. In March 1989 the Canadian province of Quebec was hit by a power cut caused by space weather with millions left without power and heat for nine hours. What are the chances of another Carrington event?In July 2012 a Carrington-class event narrowly missed hitting the planet. The sun rotates once every 25 days and by good luck the active area of the sun was not pointing straight at earth - so this dangerous space weather was flung harmlessly beyond Earth and out into space.And it is even possible that we could see something bigger.Researchers have discovered evidence in tree ring data from fossilised wood that suggests we could get events perhaps ten times larger than the Carrington event.Miyake events, named after the scientist who discovered them, could pose a threat to modern society on a scale that is hard to comprehend. With the last one identified around a thousand years ago, you could argue it's just a matter of time.",

    "body": "The US National Park Service (NPS) is removing Martin Luther King Jr Day and Juneteenth from its list of fee-free entrance days.The move is part of President Donald Trump's \"modernisation\" of the park service, which, beginning in 2026, also includes changing the parks' cost structure to favour American citizens over foreign visitors, following a July executive order from Trump.In addition to removing the two holidays that celebrate civil rights leader MLK Jr and the end of slavery in the US, the agency is adding Flag Day, which is also Trump's birthday, as a \"patriotic\" fee-free day. People who are not US citizens will still have to pay fees on the fee-free dates, the NPS said.For the 2026 calendar year, US residents will be granted free access to national parks on President's Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day/President Trump's birthday, Independence Day weekend, 110th Birthday of the National Park Service, Constitution Day, Theodore Roosevelt's birthday and Veteran's Day.Previously, Martin Luther King Jr Day and Juneteenth were both deemed fee-free entry days by the Biden administration.Under the Trump administration's new rules, US residents will continue to pay $80 (£60) for an annual park service pass. But for non-residents, the cost will rise from $80 to to $250, the Department of the Interior, which oversees the park service, announced last month. Those without a  pass will now pay $100 per person, in addition to the standard entrance fee, at 11 of the most visited parks. \"President Trump's leadership always puts American families first,\" said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. \"These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations,\" Burgum's statement continued. In May, the department estimated in its budget proposal for 2026 fiscal year that surcharges for foreign visitors would bring in more than $90 million per year.  This is not the first time the Trump administration has targeted Juneteenth and MLK Jr Day. On his first day in office this year, Trump issued an executive order banning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes from federal agencies, which led many agencies to bar celebrations of holidays seen as DEI-related, including MLK Jr Day and Juneteenth. However, the two dates remain national holidays. In June, the Trump administration held a military parade in Washington DC to celebrate the US Army's 250th anniversary, which also happened to fall on both Flag Day and Trump's birthday. The BBC has contacted the White House for comment. ",

    "body": "53 minutes agoPaul Njie,Thomas Naadi,Chiagozie Nwonwu,BBC Africa reportersandLucy FlemingBTVThe soldiers appeared on state TV early on Sunday morning to say they were suspending the constitutionThe government of Benin says it has foiled an attempted coup by members of the West African nation's armed forces.\"The Beninese armed forces and their leadership, true to their oath, remained committed to the republic,\" Interior Minister Alassane Seidou said in a televised address several hours after a group of soldiers made a broadcast in which they said they had ousted President Patrice Talon.A presidential adviser later told the BBC the president was in a safe location.However, the situation in Cotonou, Benin's largest city and the seat of the country's government, remains unclear as huge explosions were heard in the late afternoon - thought to have been the result of an air strike.Prior to the explosions, flight-tracking data shows that three aircraft entered Benin's airspace from neighbouring Nigeria.Two have since returned to the Nigerian city of Lagos and a third appears to be heading towards an airbase in Kanji in western Nigeria. At one stage, two of the aircraft were flying side by side, which analysts suggest indicates they were military planes.At the time, a French air force plane was maintaining a circular pattern over Cotonou. French diplomats have denied earlier reports that Talon had taken refuge at France's embassy in Cotonou.There have been a series of coups in West Africa before Sunday's thwarted attempt in Benin, heightening fears that the security of the region could worsen.Benin, a former French colony, has been regarded as one of Africa's more stable democracies. But Talon has faced accusations of suppressing criticism of his policies.The nation is one of the continent's largest cotton producers, but ranks among the world's poorest countries.Nigeria, Benin's large neighbour to the east, has described the coup attempt as a \"direct assault on democracy\".Seidou said in his address that \"a small group of soldiers launched a mutiny aimed at destabilising the state and its institutions\", adding that loyalist soldiers had been able \"to retain control of the situation and foil the attempt\".Fourteen people have been arrested in connection with the attempted coup, government spokesperson Wilfried Leandre Houngbedji told news agency Reuters.A journalist in Benin told the BBC that, of those reportedly arrested, 12 are believed to have stormed the offices of the national TV station - including a soldier who had previously been sacked.Eyewitnesses told the BBC that, early on Sunday morning, gunfire was heard near the presidential residence. They also said some journalists working for the state broadcaster had been held hostage for a few hours.The French and Russian embassies urged their citizens to remain indoors, while the US embassy's advice was to stay away from Cotonou, especially the area around the presidential compound.The rebel soldiers, led by Lt Col Pascal Tigri, justified their actions by criticising Talon's management of the country, complaining first about his handling of the \"continuing deterioration of the security situation in northern Benin\".Benin's army has suffered loses near its northern border with insurgency-hit Niger and Burkina Faso in recent years, as jihadist militants linked to Islamic State and al-Qaeda spread southwards.The soldier's statement cited \"the ignorance and neglect of the situation of our brothers in arms who have fallen at the front and, above all, that of their families, abandoned to their sad fate by Mr Patrice Talon's policies\".The rebels also hit out at cuts in health care, including the cancellation of state-funded kidney dialysis, and taxes rises, as well as curbs on political activities.Talon, 67, who is regarded as a close ally of the West, is due to step down next year after completing his second term in office, with elections scheduled for April.A businessman known as the \"king of cotton\", he first came to power in 2016. He promised not to seek a third term, despite Benin's current two-term limit for presidencies, and has endorsed Finance Minister Romuald Wadagni as his successor.Talon has been praised by his supporters for overseeing economic development, but his government has also been criticised for suppressing dissenting voices.In October, Benin's electoral commission barred the main opposition candidate from standing on the grounds that he did not have enough sponsors.Last month, constitutional amendments were passed by MPs, including the creation of a second parliamentary chamber, the Senate.Terms for elected officials were extended from five to seven years, but the presidential two-term limit remained in place.AFPPresident Patrice Talon, a businessman known as the \"king of cotton\", has said he intends step down next year after two terms in officeSunday's attempted coup comes just over a week after Guinea-Bissau's President Umaro Sissoco Embaló was overthrown - though some regional figures have questioned whether this was staged.In recent years, West Africa has also seen coups in Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali and Niger, prompting concerns about the region's stability.Russia has strengthened its ties with these Sahel countries over recent years - and Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger have left the West African regional bloc Ecowas to form their own group, the Alliance of Sahel States.News of the attempted takeover in Benin was hailed by several pro-Russian social media accounts, according to BBC Monitoring.Ecowas and the African Union (AU) have condemned the coup attempt.AU Commission chair Mahmoud Ali Yousouf reiterated the pan-African organisation's \"zero tolerance stance toward any unconstitutional change of government, regardless of context or justification\".You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "2 days agoPatrick JacksonandEmma BrancatisanoReutersRecruits on live-fire exercises in Ahlen, Germany, last monthSome of Europe's biggest Nato members are moving to strengthen their professional armies through voluntary national service schemes.Large conscripted armies were a feature of Nato states during the Cold War but they dwindled in size after the collapse of the Soviet Union.However, Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the ongoing war there have kindled fears of a possible future Russian attack on Nato.Here we look at how this new recruitment drive is playing out among Nato's 30 European member states, many of whom still have conscript armies.Who conscripts?Conscription is in place for nine of Europe's Nato states: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Sweden and Turkey.In Turkey, which has the second largest military in the security alliance after the US, men between the ages of 20 and 41 are obliged to do military service for between six and 12 months.By comparison, Norway conscripts both men and women, generally for 12 months.Croatia plans to reintroduce conscription next year - it will become mandatory for men aged 19 to 29 to undergo two months of basic military training.Other Nato members do not conscript but have professional militaries.The UK, which rivals France or Germany in conventional military strength (and is the only Nato state in Europe along with France to have nuclear weapons), relies on a professional army.It is unique among Nato members for recruiting minors - 16-year-olds may join with parental consent.Albania, Czechia, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain also have professional militaries.Iceland has no regular military forces, though its Coast Guard performs some defence tasks.Who is looking for volunteers?Only this month, Belgium's defence ministry sent letters to 17-year-olds inviting them to volunteer for about €2,000 a month.The voluntary military service scheme, due to start next year, aims to raise the number of reservists in the army from a pool of about 6,000 to 20,000.Belgium's neighbour, the Netherlands, launched voluntary military service in 2023 as it sought to underpin its professional armed forces.Poland, which has one of Nato's biggest armies, launched one-month voluntary basic military training in 2024. This year, Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced plans to introduce \"large-scale military training for every adult male\" in the country.\"We're talking about the need to have an army of half a million in Poland, including the reservists,\" he said.In 2020, Bulgaria introduced voluntary military service for citizens up to the age of 40 for a period of six months and Romania plans to bring in four-month voluntary military service next year.Poland announces military training plan for all menHow does Germany plan to build 'Europe's strongest army'?Germany ended compulsory military service in 2011.Its parliament has now voted in favour of instating military service on a voluntary basis. If the security situation worsens or if too few volunteers came forward, a form of compulsory military service could be considered.The new law will require all 18-year-old men to fill in a questionnaire asking if they are willing and able to join the armed forces, and from July 2027, undergo a medical examination to establish their suitability. If war were to break out, the military would be able to draw on the questionnaires and medical exams for potential recruits.Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said he wants to create the \"strongest conventional army in Europe\".The plan is to expand the armed forces from the current 183,000 active service personnel to 260,000 by 2035 – plus 200,000 reservists.Students in about 90 cities across the country took part in a school strike on 5 December in protest against the move, with some using the slogan \"Don't end up as cannon fodder\".A recent Forsa survey of German public opinion for Stern magazine suggested that while just over half of respondents favoured compulsory service, opposition rose to 63% among 18 to 29-year-olds.Germany agrees new military service plan\"I don't want to be part of this war machine\": Young Germans protest against military service plansWhat are French teenagers being offered?France, which abolished military conscription 25 years ago, currently has around 200,000 military personnel and a further 47,000 reservists. A new scheme envisages adding volunteers to the structure.Young men and women will be invited to serve for 10 months of paid military training.This new \"national service\" will be brought in gradually from next summer, mainly for 18 and 19-year-olds, who will receive at least €800 (£700) a month.Initially, numbers will be restricted to 3,000 next year, but this should rise to 50,000 by 2035.\"The only way to avoid danger is to prepare for it,\" President Emmanuel Macron said while announcing the plan. \"We need to mobilise, mobilising the nation to defend itself, to be ready and remain respected.\"Polls suggest a large majority of the public favour voluntary military service. An Elabe survey found that 73% supported the measure. Young people – aged 25-34 – were the least supportive, but even in this age group there was a 60% majority.France to bring in form of military serviceWhat about the rest of Europe?Europe's other states take various approaches to staffing their militaries.Among EU states not belonging to Nato: Austria has a system of compulsory military service for men aged between 18 and 35, who are required to serve for around six months or take part in alternative service. Women can serve voluntarilyCyprus has compulsory military service for all male citizens over 18, along with some of those who are of Cypriot descent. Women can enlist voluntarily after a law passed parliament in AprilBoth the Republic of Ireland and Malta have professional militariesIn Switzerland, a non-EU country, male citizens aged 18 to 30 must serve in the military, or join civil defence or an alternate civilian service. Last week, Swiss voters widely rejected a proposal to extend national service - in the military, civil protection teams or other forms - to women.",

    "body": "Lured by lucrative job offers and sent to fight for Russia - Kenyans want their sons back2 days agoDavid WafulaBBC Newsday, NairobiKuloba familyDavid Kuloba, seen here with a Russian fighter, thought he had secured a well-paying job as a security guardDavid Kuloba's mother warned him about going to Russia after he accepted a job as a security guard advertised by a recruitment agency in Kenya.At first the family, who live in the Kenyan capital's crowded informal settlement of Kibera had been excited when he said he had found work abroad - it sounded like a rare break.The 22-year-old had been doing casual labour in Nairobi - from selling groundnuts to construction jobs - and had long hoped to secure work in the Gulf.But when his mother asked which country he was heading to, his reply shocked her.\"He showed me his phone and said: 'Look, it's Russia,'\" Susan Kuloba told the BBC's Newsday programme. \"I told him: 'Don't you see what they show on TV about Russia? It's never good,\" she recalled.But her son insisted the offer was genuine, telling her he had been promised more than $7,000 (£5,250) on arrival - a life-changing sum for a young man with no stable income.Despite her protests, he travelled to Russia in August without telling her the exact date of his departure. She was shocked when he contacted her later, saying he had arrived and sending a photograph of himself in full combat uniform.\"He told me: 'Mum, the job we were told we came to do has been changed, but even this one is not bad,'\" she said.Kuloba familyThis is David Kuloba's military ID. He told his mother his unit was ambushed within days of arriving in Russian-controlled territory Her son explained that he and some other Kenyan men had been given two weeks of combat training - and he was heading to the battle zone in Ukraine, which Russia invaded in 2022.Within days, he told her that he and others had been ambushed in an area controlled by Russian forces. She pleaded with him to come home.\"I said: 'David, please leave that place.' He told me: 'How can I leave? I signed a contract. Give me at least one year.'\"Then I received the message I feared,\" Mrs Kuloba said.It was 4 October. David had sent her a voice note saying he was about to go into battle and in case he did not survive, he wanted her to have details of his Russian military ID and contract, which was written in Russian.He urged her to take the documents to the Russian embassy if anything happened to him.That was the last time she heard from him. Confused and terrified, she sought help not long after from her son's  friend, who told her that he had heard David was dead.\"I asked his friend: 'How do you know?' He said: 'Let me give you the number of the agent who received us in Russia.'\"Mrs Kuloba messaged the number - the replies came in Russian at first. When she identified herself, the person told her in English that David was missing, feared dead.\"I'm sorry to tell you this about your son,\" the agent said.Kuloba familyDavid Kuloba, who sent his family this photo of himself in battle gear, last contacted his mother on 4 OctoberShe asked for a picture of his body, or confirmation that David was in a morgue. None came.The contact told her he was \"very far away\", and suggested that she travel to Russia herself, or send another relative, something she said the family could not afford to do.Later, the same contact told her she was \"entitled to compensation\" for her son's death but again, without providing any documentation.Mrs Kuloba says she has been unable to obtain official confirmation from the Russian authorities about David. When she visited the Russian embassy in Nairobi, officials there told her they did not \"associate with the army\".She has no idea what to do next and is beside herself with grief: \"How do we start? Because we don't know anything. He was my first-born. I depended on him.\"The father of another Kenyan man who went to work in Russia told the BBC he was recruited on the understanding that he was going to be driver - nothing to do with armed combat.The young man ended up being wounded in Ukraine and has been too traumatised to speak since returning home two weeks ago. The BBC has agreed not to identify him to protect his wellbeing.His father only discovered that his son had travelled to Russia after receiving word that he had been injured.\"He had hinted that people were going, and I discouraged him,\" the father told the BBC. \"I was following the war from the beginning. I was not comfortable.\"Agents had promised around $1,500 a month, he said - \"good money\" for a qualified driver in Kenya.His son later told him that, like David Kuloba, he had been trained for only two weeks before being sent to the battlefield.\"He said he was injured in the bush and for five days he could not find treatment. He was using painkillers,\" the father said.He was eventually taken towards the border where he received first aid and was later transferred to St Petersburg.He had described seeing \"scattered bodies of other fighters\" and explained that many like him had signed one-year contracts without fully understanding the terms, the father said.Last month, Kenya's foreign minister said some 200 Kenyans were known to be fighting for Russia and acknowledged that recruitment networks were still active.This followed the news in September that a young Kenyan athlete had been captured in Ukraine, saying he had been tricked into joining the Russian army.The government now says several recruitment agencies are under investigation, and some licences have already been suspended.\"Some agencies lure young people with promises of large payments. The government is tracking those agencies linked to this fraud,\" Sylvanus Osoro, Kenya's parliamentary majority chief whip, told the BBC.Out of about 130 registered recruitment agencies in Kenya, around five had been flagged, with three already suspended and two others under investigation, he explained.Parliament's Defence and Foreign Relations Committee had taken up the matter and the agencies it summoned were expected to outline how they had recruited young people, what information they had provided and how contracts were presented, Osoro said.But families with relatives unexpectedly fighting for Russian forces have criticised the government for its slow response, saying they feel helpless.Pressed on what was being done to repatriate those who were lured into combat roles, Osoro said the process must follow diplomatic channels.\"A contract is signed willingly, even if they were not aware,\" he said. \"It can only be handled diplomatically. Those engagements are happening.\"He said that all known cases had \"been mapped\" and that officials were verifying the circumstances under which contracts had been signed. But he declined to confirm how many Kenyans might have died.\"I wouldn't give such a report. That is not for me,\" he said. \"What I can say is that work is in progress.\"Osoro said new legislation was being drafted to tighten controls on recruitment agencies, including stricter scrutiny before licences were issued and clearer distinctions between categories of work.The issue extends beyond Kenya. The authorities in several African countries have reported cases of young people being approached with offers of lucrative jobs in Russia that later led to military recruitment.Many families are reluctant to speak publicly, fearing stigma or uncertainty about the legal implications for their relatives abroad.In South Africa, it has become a major scandal after it was alleged that a daughter of former President Jacob Zuma was involved in the recruitment process. She denies any wrongdoing.Ukrainian officials have repeatedly warned that anyone fighting for Russia will be treated as an enemy combatant, and that the only safe route out is to surrender and be treated as a prisoner of war.Mrs Kuloba still has no official confirmation of her son's fate. She would like his body to be repatriated if he has died.\"I just feel heartbroken,\" she said. \"He wanted to help us. He thought he was going for a better job.\"Additional reporting by BBC Newsday's Maureen Nyukuri in NairobiYou may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "1 day agoSebastian UsherBBC Middle East analystThe Iranian judiciary says two organisers of a marathon have been arrested for allowing women who were not wearing hijabs to take part.The move comes after images appeared online of unveiled women competing in the race on Friday.Around 2,000 women and 3,000 men took part separately in the marathon on Kish Island off the southern coast of Iran.Dressed in red t-shirts, some of the female competitors were clearly not wearing the hijab or any other head covering.This drew very different reactions. Many supporters of change in Iran enthusiastically hailed the images as further evidence of Iranian women rejecting the restrictions placed by the authorities on what they can wear.For their part, Iranian officials have responded to it as an unacceptable challenge to the status quo.The judiciary has moved quickly against the organisers.It is not just the flouting of the rules on the hijab by some female competitors but that the marathon was held at all that has drawn condemnation from the country theocratic Islamic leadership.Just a few years ago, the sight of so many Iranian women in sports gear participating in such a mass public event – even if segregated from male participants – would have been seen as a contravention.The prosecutor in Kish said the way that the race was being held was in itself a \"violation of public decency\". The issue of the hijab remains at the heart of the debate on where Iran might be going.Government action against women appearing in public without a head covering has varied - sometimes permitting a loosening of the rules, at others mounting a clampdown on any transgression.The mass protests that rocked Iran for months three years ago were triggered by the death of the young Kurdish Iranian woman, Mahsa Amini, who died in custody after being detained over an alleged breach of the dress code.Since the protests were quelled through force and mass arrests, some Iranian women have continued to defy the rules.That has prompted a recent pushback by the authorities.The head of the judiciary has warned of a renewed campaign against women not wearing the hijab in public.Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said that intelligence agencies had been ordered to identify and report on what he called \"organised trends promoting immorality and non-veiling\". There is clearly no end for now in the standoff between Iran's leaders and many of its own people – particularly in the younger generation – over how women are allowed to dress.",

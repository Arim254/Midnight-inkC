    "body": "Four people have been killed and 12 others injured, four critically, after a mass shooting in the US state of Mississippi.The shooting happened at around midnight on the main street in Leland, a small town 120 miles (190km) north-east of the state capital Jackson, the small city's Mayor John Lee told the BBC.Four of the injured were airlifted to hospital, Lee added. No suspects were in custody, but a police manhunt was under way.Leland was busier than usual on Friday with the local high school scheduled to play a football game to mark homecoming, an annual US tradition, usually in autumn, when former students are welcomed back to celebrate school spirit and community. The mayor said that the shooting did not take place on the Leland High School campus.\"This is an event where we have held yearly for years and hadn't had any incidents of this sort, ever,\" Lee told BBC. \"And we're a city that, not high crime and about 3,700 people. We all get along, and everybody knows everybody. So this is definitely a tragedy to us.\"The Leland Police Department is still investigating the incident and told the BBC it cannot share any further details at this time, including how many rounds were fired and what kind of gun was used. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is helping the inquiry.State Senator Derrick Simmons told the Associated Press that the scene was \"very chaotic\" after the gunfire erupted, as police and first responders rushed to the area \"from all over\". \"People were just congregating and having a good time in the downtown of Leland,\" Simmons told the AP. Officials are asking for anyone with information about the \"horrific\" shooting to come forward, Simmons added. A deadly shooting was also reported on Friday night in another small Mississippi town, Heidelberg, about 200 miles south-east of Leland.That attack also happened during the town's homecoming weekend, and claimed two lives, Heidelberg Police Chief Cornell White told the AP. There is no indication the Leland and Heidelberg shootings were linked. ",

    "body": "Former US President Joe Biden is receiving radiation therapy as part of his treatment for prostate cancer, his spokesman has said.The spokesman also said that Biden, 82, was undergoing hormone treatment, without giving any further details.The radiation treatment was expected to span five weeks and marked a new point in his care, a source told NBC News.In May, Biden's office announced that he was diagnosed with a more aggressive form of the disease, which had spread to his bones. The discovery was made after the Democrat politician reported urinary symptoms which led doctors to find a small nodule on his prostate. The Biden office said at the time that \"he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterised by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone.\"While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management.\"A Gleason score of nine meant his illness was classified as \"high-grade\" and the cancer cells could spread quickly, according to Cancer Research UK.Biden left office in January as the oldest serving US president in history and questions about his health dogged his first term, leading him to end his run for re-election late in his campaign.His former vice-president, Kamala Harris, ran instead as the Democrat's presidential candidate, losing to current US President Donald Trump.For many years, Biden has advocated for cancer research.In 2022, he and his wife Jill Biden relaunched the \"cancer moonshot\" initiative with the goal of mobilising research efforts to prevent more than four million cancer deaths by the year 2047.Biden himself lost his eldest son, Beau, to brain cancer in 2015.In recent months, Biden has largely retreated from the public eye. In May, he sat down for an interview with the BBC - his first since leaving the White House - where he admitted that the decision to step down from the 2024 race was \"difficult\".Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer affecting men, behind skin cancer, according to the American Cancer Society.The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that 13 out of every 100 men will develop prostate cancer at some point in their lives. It says age is the most common risk factor.",

    "body": "52 minutes agoDanai Nesta Kupemba andChris EwokorDozens of people have been killed in a drone strike at a displacement shelter in el-Fasher, a besieged Sudanese city on the brink of collapse, activists said.The resistance committee for el-Fasher, made up of local citizens and activists, said the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) hit Dar al-Arqam camp, located within a university, with two drone strikes and eight artillery shells. The RSF has denied it carried out the strike.\"Children, women and the elderly were killed in cold blood, and many were completely burned,\" a statement from the group said. Eyewitnesses described scenes of panic as rescuers pulled bodies from the rubble.Sudan Doctors Network said 57 people were killed in the drone attack, including 17 children, and 17 were injured. Activists said at least 60 people had been killed.Hospitals already struggling under months of siege have been overwhelmed, with doctors treating the wounded on floors and in corridors.The RSF has surrounded el-Fasher for the last 17 months, in an attempt to take control of the Sudanese army's last stronghold in the Darfur region. The situation in el-Fasher has \"gone beyond disaster and genocide\", the resistance group said.Sudan has been ravished by conflict since 2023, after top commanders of the RSF and Sudanese army fell out and a vicious power struggle ensued - creating one of the worst humanitarian crises.The army controls most of the north and the east. El-Fasher is the last major urban centre in Darfur still held by the army and its allies. The RSF also controls almost all of Darfur and much of neighbouring Kordofan.If el-Fasher falls the RSF will control the entire Darfur region, where they hope to form an alternative government. In recent weeks, the RSF has intensified its assault on el-Fasher, leading experts to believe the city could soon fall unless the army receives immediate reinforcements. Research showed the RSF had finished building an earthen wall around el-Fasher, bolstering their siege and making it even harder for civilians to escape.The UN said there were 250,000 civilians trapped in el-Fasher, and warned that continued strikes on civilian areas may amount to war crimes.Hunger and disease has spread across the city as residents contend with constant bombardment and dwindling food and medical supplies. Two days ago, at least 13 people were killed after the RSF shelled one of the last remaining hospitals in el-Fasher.UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk condemned the continued killing and injuring of civilians on Friday. \"I am appalled by the RSF's endless and wanton disregard for civilian life,\" he said.More than 150,000 people have died in the conflict across the country, and about 12 million have fled their homes.",

    "body": "The US has finalised an agreement that will allow Qatar to build an air force facility in Idaho, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has announced.He said the facility - where pilots from the Gulf state would be trained to fly F-15 fighter jets - would be established at the Mountain Home Airbase in the north-western US state.\"It's just another example of our partnership,\" Hegseth said during a meeting with his Qatari counterpart, Saoud bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, at the Pentagon on Friday.Hegseth also praised Qatar for playing a \"substantial role\" in efforts led by President Donald Trump to secure a Gaza ceasefire and hostage return deal.Qatar - along with Egypt and Turkey - has been an active mediator during months of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas.On Friday, Hegseth said he was \"proud that today we're signing a letter of acceptance to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force Facility at the Mountain Home Airbase in Idaho\".\"The location will host a contingent of Qatari F-15s and pilots to enhance our combined training, increase lethality, interoperability, it's just another example of our partnership.\"You can count on us,\" Hegseth told al-Thani.The Pentagon chief did not say how many Qatari F-15s would be based at the Idaho facility, and when it would become operational.Last month, President Trump signed an executive order pledging to use all measures - including the US military - to defend Qatar.The order amounts to an extraordinary security pact between America and a key Arab ally, almost mirroring aspects of a Nato alliance.The move came after Israeli air strikes targeted Hamas leaders in Qatar's capital Doha on 9 September, leaving several lower-level members of the Palestinian group dead, along with a Qatari security official.Qatar hosts Washington's biggest military base in the Middle East - the al-Udeid.The base - home to the US military's headquarters for all air operations in the region - was attacked earlier this by Iran in retaliation for American strikes against its nuclear sites.",

    "body": "6 hours agoDearbail Jordan andHafizullah MaroofBBC AfghanIndian politicians and journalists have criticised the government for failing to speak out after female journalists were excluded from a press event with the Afghan Taliban foreign minister in Delhi.Around 16 male reporters were selected to attend a forum on Friday with Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi at the Afghan embassy. Journalists observed women and foreign media being turned away.India's Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said it \"had no involvement in the press interaction\" at the Afghan embassy.A source in the Taliban government admitted women had not been invited to attend.They told the BBC \"female journalists were excluded due to lack of proper coordination and will be invited to next conference if held in Delhi\". Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said by allowing the event to go ahead, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi was \"telling every woman in India that you are too weak to stand up for them\".The Editors Guild of India strongly condemned the exclusion and said: \"Whether or not the MEA coordinated the event, it is deeply troubling that such a discriminatory exclusion was allowed to proceed without objection.\"It called for India's government to \"publicly reaffirm that press access at diplomatic events held in India must respect gender equity\".Muttaqi is in India for a week of high-level talks with the government. On Friday, he met with Foreign Minister S Jaishankar who announced that India would re-open its embassy in Kabul. It was shut after the Taliban returned to power.Since 2021, the Taliban government has imposed numerous restrictions in accordance with their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law which have severely impacted the rights of Afghan women and girls.  Following the men-only press event, Rahul Gandhi said on social media: \"In our country, women have the right to equal participation in every space.\"Indian politician Priyanka Gandhi Vadra asked Modi to clarify his position on \"the removal of female journalists\" from the gathering.She asked how \"this insult to some of India's most competent women\" had been allowed in \"a country whose women are its backbone and its pride\".Others expressed shock and said the men who went to the event should have walked out in solidarity with their female colleagues.\"Why did our emasculated spineless male journos remain in room?\" wrote politician Mahua Moitra on social media. She added: \"Government has dishonoured every single Indian woman by allowing  Taliban minister to exclude women journalists from presser. Shameful bunch of spineless hypocrites.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoNorberto ParedesBBC Mundo andAlex BoydWatch: 'A great honour for Venezuelan society' - Machado speaks to the BBCNobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado has told the BBC she is grateful for what US President Donald Trump is doing \"around the world for peace\".Machado, Venezuela's opposition leader, was awarded the 2025 prize having long campaigned against the country's President Nicolás Maduro Moros, whose 12-year rule is viewed by many as illegitimate.She told BBC Mundo that during a congratulatory phone call with Trump she told him \"how grateful the Venezuelan people are for what he's doing, not only in the Americas, but around the world for peace, for freedom, for democracy\".Trump has made no secret about wanting to win the award himself, regularly speaking about the seven wars he claims to have ended.Nominations for the award closed in January, just as Trump's second term as president began. A White House official said on Friday the \"Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace\".Machado said she was \"very glad\" to speak to the US president and was \"able to convey to him our appreciation\".The 58-year-old, forced to live in hiding for much of the past year, was hailed by the Nobel Committee as \"one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times\".Nobel chairman Jørgen Watne Frydnes said she was recognised for \"her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy\".He added: \"Despite serious threats against her life, she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions.\"Machado was barred from running in last year's presidential elections, in which Maduro won a third six-year term in office.The elections were widely dismissed on the international stage as neither free nor fair, and sparked protests across the country.Even after she was barred from the polls, she managed to unite the notoriously divided opposition faction and succeeded in getting millions of Venezuelans behind the little-known candidate which replaced her on the ballot, Edmundo González.When the government-controlled National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner - even though tallies from polling stations showed that González had won by a landslide - Machado continued to campaign from hiding as the Maduro government has repeatedly threatened her with arrest.Machado told BBC Mundo her award was \"like an injection\" for her political movement.\"It infuses energy, hope, strength on the Venezuelan people because we realise that we are not alone,\" she added. \"The democrats around the world share our struggle.\"She said she thought Trump and the international community were already helping with the political situation in Venezuela.\"The regime in Venezuela is a criminal structure,\" Machado told the BBC. \"And as such, it sustains themselves on the criminal flows from their illicit activities.\"We need the international community to cut those flows that are not only used for corruption, but also for repression, violence and terror.\"So when you cut the inflows that come from drug trafficking, gold smuggling, arms smuggling, human trafficking, or the black market of oil, then the regime falls.\"And that's exactly what we're seeing, cracks that are getting deeper and deeper as we talk right now.\"Earlier this month, US forces killed four people in an attack on a boat off the coast of Venezuela that was allegedly trafficking drugs.It was the latest in a number of recent strikes by the US on boats in international waters it said were involved in \"narco-trafficking\".They have attracted condemnation in countries including Venezuela and Colombia, with some international lawyers describing the strikes as a breach of international law.On Thursday Colombian President Gustavo Petro said one of the boats was \"Colombian with Colombian citizens inside\", an allegation the White House called \"baseless\".",

The facility specialises in the development and manufacture of explosives.Video footage taken on Friday showed fires still burning, charred vehicles, and smoke rising from the razed building. Officials said debris was scattered for half a mile around where the building once stood.Accurate Energetic Systems (AES), which runs the plant, has suspended its operations.Aerial footage shows devastation after blast at explosives manufacturer in TennesseeMore than 300 state and local first responders have been searching the site since Friday morning, Sheriff Davis said on Saturday.\"The expectation of anyone who's inside of that building… we can assume that they are deceased,\" he told media.By Saturday morning, the rescue mission had shifted to a recovery operation, said a visibly choked-up Davis. The FBI is also at the scene conducting rapid DNA tests to identify victims and notify families.\"We're trying to focus as much attention as we can, on taking care of their families,\" Sheriff Jason Craft, from neighbouring Hickman County, told the BBC.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms is at the scene helping to investigate the incident. There was a previous fatal explosion at a unit in the same location in 2014.Ann Myers was woken from her sleep by the explosion on Friday morning and feared for the safety of her four children. She wondered if it was a tornado or a road accident.The camper home they live in shook and the electricity went out briefly.\"It was the weirdest thing ever,\" she said. \"So then I'm like, are we in a tornado? Is there, you know, a bomb somewhere? \"But then I thought maybe a tractor trailer, you know, hit somewhere off the interstate. So it's definitely very frightening.\"Justin Stover, whose property borders the sprawling AES plant, told the BBC his house shook violently following the explosion. At first, he thought it was a plane crash and he feared his house would collapse.\"Things fell off the wall, items fell off shelves,\" Mr Stover said. \"It was very intimidating, like the loudest thunder you've ever heard in your life and rumble.\"Then he saw \"a large cloud of smoke coming from the area of AES\", Stover added.He is still assessing damage to his house and said the explosion may have affected his water well.Stover, who has lived in Bucksnort for 20 years, said AES had about 80 workers.\"It's one of the only businesses in this area,\" he said. \"So it's one of the only places for employment, for locals. \"There's a lot of people that we know that work there and that possibly lost their lives yesterday morning.The tragedy will be devastating for the whole community, he said, as it has already been for families of the victims. Residents farther away from the site also heard the blast, including some in a town about 15 miles (25km) away, Sheriff Davis said on Friday.One local resident who lives about 20 minutes away from the facility told the BBC she was sitting at her daughter's dining table when she heard it. \"All of a sudden we just a heard a loud bang. We didn't know if it was a gun or what,\" she said.Another local resident, Lucy Garton said her husband knows people who worked in the facility.\"I think it will definitely impact the area,\" she said. \"It's a very close-knit community and everyone, they're just simple people, go to work every day, take care of their families and just real a family-oriented community.\"",

    "body": "1 day agoTom Batemanstate department correspondent andElaine OkyereBBC News EPAUp to 200 US troops already based in the Middle East will be moved to Israel to help monitor the ceasefire in Gaza, according to US officials.The US military will establish a multinational taskforce in Israel, known as a civil-military coordination centre, which is likely to include troops from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and the UAE, they said.One senior official said no US forces will enter Gaza, adding that the American role was to create a Joint Control Center which will \"integrate\" the multinational force going in.The Israeli government has approved the first phase of a Gaza deal with Hamas, which has led to a ceasefire and the release of hostages and prisoners. Israel-Gaza war ceasefire live updatesThe taskforce will be led by US Central Command (Centcom) based in the region, and is intended to oversee the progress of the ceasefire agreement and also help coordinate humanitarian assistance.The multinational force will inform both the Israelis and Hamas via Egypt and Qatar of the situation on the ground and any potential violations of the truce, one of the officials said.The force is being established under the leadership of Adm Brad Cooper, head of Centcom. He joined the American delegation for part of indirect talks in Egypt earlier this week, one of the officials said. Those talks led to US President Donald Trump announcing on Thursday that Israel and Hamas had \"signed off on the first phase\" of a peace plan he unveiled last week. One of the point's in Trump's 20-point Gaza plan included the US working with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilisation Force to immediately deploy in Gaza but this is yet to be agreed between the sides and would only happen if a hostage and prisoner exchange is completed.Israel launched the war in Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.Since then, Israel's massive military offensive has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, including more than 18,000 children. These figures are seen as reliable by the UN and other international bodies.",

    "body": "Zimbabwean opposition lawmaker Desire Moyo has died after the vehicle he was travelling in hit an elephant, local media report.The accident happened in the early hours of Friday morning while Mr Moyo and four other MPs were travelling along the Bulawayo-Gweru highway, according to state-owned broadcaster ZBC.He died instantly while his fellow lawmakers were left injured, the news outlet added.Tributes are pouring in for the well-known poet, hailed for his contribution to the arts, who died a day before his 46th birthday.He was a member of the opposition Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), and served in the Zimbabwean parliament's sport, recreation, arts and culture committee.The Nkulumane Constituency in Zimbabwe's second city, Bulawayo, which he represented, confirmed the news of his death in a statement and shared its \"deep sorrow and profound shock\". Fellow CCC member and MP Discent Bajila provided more details on the horrific crash to local news site ZimLive.com. He told the publication he had spoken to the injured MPs, who relayed what had happened.\"I spoke to [Madalaboy] Ndebele, who was in the front passenger seat. His recollection is that they hit the elephant on its backside. After the impact, he remembers the elephant turning round and fighting the vehicle. \"This, he believes, is what did the most damage on the top right side of the vehicle and ultimately led to Moyo's fatal injuries,\" Bajila said.The accident took place in an area where elephants are known to roam to and from their home ranges in the north-west of Zimbabwe.Fellow lawmaker Caston Matewu was among those to pay tribute to Moyo, affectionately known as Moyoxide, hailing him as \"one of the hardest working MPs in Parliament\".\"The people of Nkulumani [sic] have been robbed of this great [man],\" Mr Matewu said.The City of Bulawayo, led by mayor David Coltart, said Mr Moyo would be remembered as an \"iconic leader ... and creative\" who \"strove to champion the arts\" in the city and beyond.Mr Moyo was an award-winning poet, educator and arts administrator \"who devoted his life to nurturing Zimbabwe's creative sector\", according to the state-run Herald news site.The other lawmakers involved in Friday's crash have been taken to hospital.",

The statement by the Danish defence ministry says the purpose of its military is security, and if necessary, defence in the Nato security alliance.\"The task of the Armed Forces is to ensure security throughout the Kingdom - and, if necessary, to defend Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Denmark within the framework of Nato in all domains,\" the Chief of Defence, Michael Hyldgaard, told Danish public broadcaster DR, without saying who the potential adversaries were.Denmark worked on the new defence package with the governments of Greenland and the Faroe Islands.It will buy two new Arctic ships, maritime patrol planes, drones and early warning radar.Crucially, a new Arctic command headquarters will be set up in the Greenlandic capital, Nuuk, alongside a new military unit under Joint Arctic Command in Greenland.In addition, an undersea cable connecting Greenland and Denmark will be funded. The struggle for control of the Arctic is accelerating - and riskier than everGreenland in particular is strategically located between North America and Russia. Though the island has wide-ranging autonomy, it remains part of the kingdom of Denmark.In recent years, there has been increased interest in the vast island's natural resources, including mining for rare earth minerals, uranium and iron.Greenland lies on the shortest route from North America to Europe, making it strategically important for the US. The island has been home to a US radar base since the Cold War and also hosts a large American space facility.US President Donald Trump has suggested the island is crucial to military efforts to track Chinese and Russian ships, which he said are \"all over the place\".Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to acquire Greenland, saying the island was \"critical\" for national and economic security.Greenland's prime minister has said the territory is not for sale, adding that \"Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland\".",

    "body": "Burkina Faso's military government has refused to take in deportees from the US, as Washington suspended issuing visas in the West African nation.Foreign affairs minister Karamoko Jean-Marie Traoré questioned if the embassy's decision was \"blackmail\" after he said he had rejected a US proposal to take in migrants from third countries. Donald Trump's administration has turned to African countries as a destination to deport migrants to as part of his crackdown on immigration.  The US State Department said it was committed to ending illegal and mass migration and bolstering US border security. The Department of Homeland Security have been contacted for comment.Burkina Faso's leader Capt Ibrahim Traoré styles himself as a pan-African champion, standing up to Western imperialism. His military government seized power in a coup three years ago, and has had a frosty relationship with Western nations ever since.Destination: Africa - is it legal for US to deport foreign criminals to the continent?Deported from the US to Ghana then 'dumped' at the border: Nigerian man speaks outAppearing on state broadcaster RTB late on Thursday, the foreign minister asked: \"Is this a way to put pressure on us? Is this blackmail? Whatever it is... Burkina Faso is a place of dignity, a destination, not a place of expulsion.\" He said he had a meeting with the US Embassy on Wednesday in which he rejected the offer - that he said had been made repeatedly - to accept deportees.On Thursday, the US embassy in Burkina Faso's capital Ouagadougou announced on its website that it would temporarily pause issuing immigrant, tourist, student and business traveller visas. Instead, residents of Burkina Faso will have to travel to the US embassy in the capital of neighbouring Togo. Foreign Minister Traoré said he had received a diplomatic note from the US explaining that Burkina Faso was put on a list of countries whose nationals had not respected rules around US visas and referring to the US proposals, according to a local news outlet's transcript of the interview. Several African countries - Eswatini, Ghana, Rwanda and South Sudan - have all accepted people from third countries expelled from the US in recent months. On Monday, Eswatini accepted 10 deportees despite legal challenges, adding to an earlier group of five, which the US had described as serious criminals. However, Nigeria has said it would not take any US deportees.Trump's crackdown aims to deport millions of immigrants in the US illegally. \"Naturally, this proposal, which we considered indecent at the time, runs completely contrary to the principle of dignity,\" Traoré added.

In it, the first lady pleads with Putin to protect children, writing that doing so \"will do more than serve Russia alone\" and \"will serve humanity itself\".\"Eight children have been rejoined with their families during the past 24 hours,\" Mrs Trump said, flanked by American flags behind a podium in the White House.\"Each child has lived in turmoil because of the war in Ukraine.\"Of the eight children, the First Lady said three separated from their families were displaced to Russia because of front-line fighting.Another young girl displaced by the conflict has now been returned from Ukraine to Russia, Mrs Trump says.The children's reunification with their families was facilitated by both Ukraine and Russia, the First Lady said, adding that she was given a detailed report with photographs and the \"identities and circumstances\" of each child.The US government \"confirmed the facts\", she said.Mrs Trump said she has \"learned a lot about this matter\" since her letter was first handed to Putin. She said he responded in writing. In her letter, the First Lady wrote: \"Every child shares the same quiet dreams in their heart... They dream of love, possibility, and safety from danger.\" The announcement marks a positive development in her advocacy for children from the White House, which began during President Trump's first term. She launched the BE BEST initiative in January 2021, which the White House describes as an awareness campaign focused around the well-being of children globally.Earlier this year, the First Lady led an initiative for Congress to pass a bill banning revenge porn called the Take It Down Act. After the bill was signed, she said it was \"a powerful statement that we stand united in protecting the dignity, privacy, and safety of our children\".According to the Ukrainian government, at least 19,500 Ukrainian children have been deported and forcibly displaced from their homes to Russia and Russian-occupied territories since February 2022.Just 1,605 have come home so far, according to the government's Children of War database, external.The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Children's Rights Commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, in 2023 for the alleged unlawful deportation of children.Russia denies the accusation and says it has protected children by moving them from a war zone for their safety.",

    "body": "23 hours agoNatalie ShermanBusiness reporterWatch: 'It was shocking', Trump says of China's tightened export rules for rare earthsUS President Donald Trump has said he would impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China from next month. In a post on social media, Trump said the US would also put export controls on critical software. In an earlier post on Friday, he hit back at Beijing's move this week to tighten its rules for exports of rare earths, accusing China of \"becoming very hostile\" and trying to hold the world \"captive\".He threatened to pull out of a meeting with China's President Xi Jinping. He later said he had not cancelled it, but that he did not know \"that we're going to have it\". \"I'm going to be there regardless,\" he told reporters at the White House.Financial markets dropped in the wake of Trump's remarks, with the S&P 500 closing down 2.7%, its steepest fall since April.  China dominates production of rare earths and certain other key materials, which are key components in cars, smartphones and many other items.The last time Beijing tightened export controls - after Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods early this year - there was an outcry from many US firms reliant on the materials. Carmaker Ford even had to temporarily pause production.In addition to tightening rules for rare earth exports, China has opened a monopoly investigation into the US tech firm Qualcomm that could stall its acquisition of another chipmaker. Getty ImagesTrump visited China in his first termAlthough Qualcomm is based in the US, a significant portion of its business is concentrated in China.Beijing has also said it will charge new port fees to ships with ties to the US, including those owned or operated by US firms.\"Some very strange things are happening in China!\" Trump wrote in a post on social media on Friday. \"They are becoming very hostile.\"The US and China have been in a fragile trade détente since May, when the two sides agreed to drop triple-digit tariffs on each others' goods that had nearly stopped trade between the two countries. The move left US tariffs on Chinese goods facing an added 30% levy compared with the start of the year, while US goods entering China face a new 10% tariff.Officials have held a series of talks since then on matters including TikTok, agricultural purchases, and the trade of rare earths and advanced technology like semiconductors.The two sides were expected to meet again this month at a summit in South Korea.China expert Jonathan Czin, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, said Xi's recent actions were a bid to shape the upcoming talks, noting that the recent rare earths directive does not go into effect immediately.\"He's looking for ways to seize the initiative,\" he said. \"The Trump administration is having to play a game of whack-a-mole and deal with these issues as they come up.\"He added that he did not think China was worried about US retaliation in response.\"What China took away from the Liberation Day tariffs and the cycle of escalation followed by de-escalation is that the Chinese side had a higher pain threshold,\" he said. \"From their perspective, the Trump administration blinked.\" In prior rounds of trade talks, China has pushed for looser US restrictions on semiconductors. It is also interested in securing more stable tariff policies that would make it easier for its businesses to sell into the US. Xi had previously used as leverage his country's dominance of rare earths production. But the export rules unveiled this week target overseas defence manufacturers, making them particularly serious, said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"Nothing makes America move like targeting our defence industry,\" she said. \"The US is going to have to negotiate because we have limited options, and in an era of rising geopolitical tension and potential conflict, we need to build our industrial defence base.\"While a Trump-Xi meeting now looks unlikely, she said it was not necessarily completely off the table. Ms Baskaran said there's still time and room for talks. China's new rules don't take effect until December. \"Negotiations are likely imminent,\" she said. \"Who does them and where they happen will be determined with time.\"",

    "body": "New York Attorney General Letitia James has been criminally indicted on federal charges by a grand jury. James, who led a civil fraud investigation against Trump in 2023, was indicted on charges of bank fraud in the Eastern District of Virginia in Alexandria, according to court documents. Prosecutors accuse James of alleged bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution regarding a mortgage loan for a house in Norfolk, Virginia, the documents state. In a statement, James accused the president - who recently publicly pressured prosecutors to file criminal charges against her - of a \"desperate weaponization of our justice system\".\"He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the New York State attorney general,\" she said. \"These charges are baseless, and the president's own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost.\"The US prosecutor assigned to the case, Lindsey Halligan, meanwhile, said the case proved that \"no one is above the law\". \"The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust,\" she said. \"The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served.\"Watch: Trump's only goal is \"political retribution\" - Letitia James responds to indictmentTrump appointed Halligan, his former personal attorney, to oversee the case after another US prosecutor, Erik Siebert, resigned. Siebert was reportedly ousted after he told the justice department he had not found sufficient evidence to charge James.James' first court appearance is scheduled for 24 October in Norfolk.The federal government alleges James bought a three-bedroom home in Norfolk using a mortgage loan that required her to use the property as her secondary residence and did not allow for shared ownership or \"timesharing\" of the home. The indictment claims the property \"was not occupied or used\" by James as a secondary residence, but was instead \"used as a rental investment property\", which was being rented to a family of three.The \"misrepresentation\" allowed James to obtain favourable loan terms that would not have been available for an investment property, prosecutors claim.Halligan said that, if convicted, James could face up to 30 years in prison per count and up to a $1 million (£751,755) fine on each count.James's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said: \"We are deeply concerned that this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge.\"Trump last month called on US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who leads the justice department, in a social media post to prosecute his political opponents, including James. \"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" he wrote.James was one of several Trump adversaries named in that post. He also called on Bondi to investigate former FBI Director James Comey, who was criminally charged shortly after the post. He pleaded not guilty on Wednesday after being charged with making a false statement to Congress.The justice department has also reportedly opened investigations into Trump's ex-national security adviser John Bolton and California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff.In the civil fraud case brought by James, Trump was found liable of falsifying records to secure better loan deals, leading to a $500m (£375m) fine. The penalty was thrown out by an appeals court, which called the fine excessive, though it upheld that Trump was liable for fraud. During the case, Trump frequently attacked James outside of the courtroom, accusing her of carrying out a \"political witch hunt\" against him. James said the courts had ruled that Trump was \"not above the law\". James on Thursday said she stands behind her office's litigation against Trump and his organisation. New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said James's indictment \"is nothing less than the weaponization of the Justice Department to punish those who hold the powerful accountable.\"The New York Civil Liberties Union and American Civil Liberties Union called it \"the latest in a long list of brazen abuses of power by President Trump\".",

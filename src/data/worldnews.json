    "body": "26 minutes agoRachel Muller-HeyndykUS Department of Justice/PAEpstein took dozens more flights to the UK than were previously knownEssex Police has said it is assessing information about private flights into and out of Stansted Airport following the publication of the Epstein files.The BBC understands that while the police is \"assessing\" the information, it should not be inferred as the opening of an investigation.Last year a BBC investigation found 87 flights linked to the convicted sex offender had arrived at or departed from UK airports between the early 1990s and 2018.Ex-Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the New Statesman last week that police \"urgently\" need to re-examine whether Jeffrey Epstein's victims were trafficked within and outside of the UK.An Essex Police spokesperson said: \"We are assessing the information that has emerged in relation to private flights into and out of Stansted Airport following the publication of the US DoJ Epstein files.\"In December, BBC News discovered that three British women who were allegedly trafficked appear in Epstein's records of flights in and out of the UK alongside other documents related to the convicted sex offender.US lawyers representing hundreds of Epstein victims told the BBC it was \"shocking\" that there has never been a \"full-scale\" investigation into his activities in the UK.He added that Stansted, located around 40 miles away from central London, was one of the airports \"where women were transferred from one Epstein plane to another\".Stansted Airport said all private aircraft use entirely independent terminals not operated by Stansted, and the airport does not manage or have any visibility of passenger arrangements on privately operated aircraft.A new national group has been set up to support UK police forces that are \"assessing allegations\" following the publication of the Epstein files, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) has said.The force previously said it has held discussions with specialists from the Crown Prosecution Service about the allegations that Andrew shared confidential reports with Epstein during his time as the UK's trade envoy.The former prince has always denied any wrongdoing.Earlier this month, the Metropolitan Police launched a criminal investigation into Peter Mandelson following claims he passed market-sensitive information to Epstein.He was dismissed from his role as ambassador role in September, after Downing Street said new information had emerged about the depth of this relationship with Epstein.",

Four other people were slightly hurt in the blaze.The identities of those who died is not yet known but reports said they include children and none of them lived in the building.It is not clear why they could not escape the storage room, which is on the upper floor, according to firefighters. An investigation is under way into the fire's cause.  The grandfather of one of the young victims told La Vanguardia that the boys used the storage room, which is thought to have been converted into a living space, to meet each other. No official details have been confirmed about the victims but witnesses told local media that they were aged between 14 and 18.The local authority said it was providing support to the victims and it declared three days of mourning.Catalan President Salvador Illa Roca said he was shocked by the deaths and expressed his deepest condolences to families and friends.",

    "body": "5 hours agoWatch: High school hockey players recount Rhode Island ice rink shootingPolice have identified the suspect in a shooting at a high school ice hockey game in Rhode Island that killed two people and injured three others.Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves said Robert Dorgan, who also used the name Roberta and the surname Esposito, died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound inside the Dennis M Lynch Arena on Sunday.\"It appears that this was a targeted event, that it may be a family dispute,\" Goncalves said. She did not provide details about the identity of the victims.Video of the incident showed shots were fired while players were on the rink, sparking panic as the teams scrambled to leave the arena.Getty ImagesThe shooting happened at the Dennis M Lynch Arena in Pawtucket, about five miles (8km) north of the state capital, ProvidenceGoncalves said a bystander \"stepped in and interjected\" and \"that's probably what led to a swift end of this tragic event\".After the incident, hockey players and their families described their fear after gunfire broke out. Melissa Dunn, whose son played for one of the hockey teams, said she saw paramedics performing CPR in the stands of the arena after she ran back inside to find her son. \"You don't know what's going on at first,\" Dunn said. \"You just hear the loud noises. And we're used to the kids banging on the board with their skates, so we thought it was that at first.\"She said she screamed for her son to duck and avoid gunfire. \"We ran out of the rink… your first thought is 'where's my kid?'\" she said. \"I tried to get back in the rink, and I actually got back in there to find out where he was, and I saw them doing CPR in the stands and it was just really disturbing.\"Olin Lawrence, a high school hockey player who was on the ice at the time of the shooting, told reporters he ran inside the locker room when he heard shots being fired.\"I went down and then I ran,\" he said. \"We pressed against the door and just tried to stay safe down in there. It was very scary. We were very nervous. It was a lot of shots.\"The shooting happened at the Dennis M Lynch Arena in Pawtucket, about five miles (8km) north of the state capital, Providence, and about 45 miles south of Boston.\"Our state is grieving again,\" Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee said, referring to a shooting in December at Brown University. \"As governor, a parent and a former coach, my heart breaks for the victims, families and everyone impacted by the devastating shooting at Lynch Arena in Pawtucket.\"",

US forces have been targeting vessels they suspect of smuggling narcotics through the Caribbean and eastern Pacific since September.But the frequency of the strikes has notably ebbed since US forces in early January captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro - who has been accused by the Trump administration of working with drug trafficking groups.Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has said the overall operation is aimed at removing \"narco-terrorists from our hemisphere\" and securing the US from \"the drugs that are killing our people\".The US has provided no evidence to back up its allegations that the boats it has struck have been carrying drugs.Some legal experts have also said that the strikes could be illegal and violate international law by targeting civilians, with no due process.The Trump administration has said the killings are lawful. In a statement to Congress, the White House said President Trump had \"determined\" that the US was  in a formal armed conflict with drug cartels and that crews of drug-running boats were \"combatants\".More than 130 people have been killed in the strikes. A few families of the alleged drug-traffickers killed in strikes have gone to court against the US government.The families of two Trinidadian men killed in a 14 October strike filed a lawsuit  alleging the strike amounted to \"lawless killings in cold blood; killings for sport and killings for theatre\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoWatch: Jesse Jackson's life in civil rights, diplomacy, and politicsUS civil rights leader Jesse Jackson died aged 84 on Tuesday morning surrounded by relatives, according to a statement released by his family. \"It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of Civil Rights leader and founder of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the Honorable Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson, Sr,\" the family said, adding he died \"peacefully.\"  His cause of death has not been released, but Jackson had been diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy and was in hospital late last year.Tributes poured in for the prominent activist who twice ran to be Democrats' presidential nominee, including from the first black US president, Barack Obama.Jackson is survived by his wife Jacqueline and their children: Santita, Jesse Jr, Jonathan, Yusef, Jacqueline and Ashley. In their statement, Jackson's family said his \"unwavering commitment to justice, equality, and human rights helped shape a global movement for freedom and dignity\". \"A tireless change agent, he elevated the voices of the voiceless from his Presidential campaigns in the 1980s to mobilising millions to register to vote - leaving an indelible mark on history,\" they added.Along with working with Marting Luther King, Jr, and running for president in 1984 and 1988, Jackson is remembered as the founder of a nonprofit organisation focused on social justice and civil rights, the Rainbow PUSH coalition.Calling Jackson a \"true giant\", Obama said in a statement that Jackson's \"two historic runs for president\" had \"laid the foundation for my own campaign to the highest office of the land\". Obama added that his wife Michelle \"got her first glimpse of political organizing at the Jacksons' kitchen table when she was a teenager\".\"For more than 60 years, Reverend Jackson helped lead some of the most significant movements for change in human history,\" the Obamas also said in the statement. \"From organizing boycotts and sit-ins, to registering millions of voters, to advocating for freedom and democracy around the world, he was relentless in his belief that we are all children of God, deserving of dignity and respect.\"Jackson was admitted to hospital last November, and doctors said he had been diagnosed with a rare degenerative condition called progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) in April 2025, revising an earlier diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease that Jackson had said was made in 2015.Both diseases affect the brain, nervous system, and muscle control and, according to the American Parkinson Disease Association and the group CurePSP, many people with PSP are initially diagnosed with Parkinson's because a number of the symptoms overlap. Born in 1941 in Greenville, South Carolina, Jackson became involved in politics at an early age. He rose to prominence in the 1960s as a leader in Martin Luther King, Jr 's Southern Christian Leadership Conference and was with King when he was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1968.Over the course of his career, Jackson built a movement to bring America's increasingly diverse population together, with a message that centred on poor and working-class Americans.After his presidential runs, Jackson later positioned himself as an elder statesman within the Democratic Party.His son Jesse Jackson, Jr is a former US congressman.Getty ImagesJackson was remembered by politicians and friends as an agent of change and a transformative leaderShortly after his death was announced, politicians and other public figures took to social media to mourn the loss of Jackson. US President Donald Trump said he knew Jackson \"long before becoming president\". \"He was a good man, with lots of personality, grit, and 'street smarts,'\" Trump said. \"He was very gregarious - Someone who truly loved people!\"Former President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary, a former secretary of state, also shared tributes, saying they were friends with Jackson for \"almost fifty years\".\"Reverend Jackson championed human dignity and helped create opportunities for countless people to live better lives,\" they said in a statement. House of Representatives Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Jackson \"was a legendary voice for the voiceless,\" in a tribute to the late civil rights leader posted on X.\"For decades, while laboring in the vineyards of the community, he inspired us to keep hope alive in the struggle for liberty and justice for all,\" the Democrat said.New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani said the civil rights leader \"never stopped demanding that America live up to its promise\".\"He marched, he ran, he organized and he preached justice without apology,\" Mamdani said. King's daughter Bernice said Jackson had \"devoted his life to lifting people in poverty, the marginalized, and those pushed to society's edges\". Civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton, who worked closely with Jackson during the civil rights movement, said Jackson was a \"consequential and transformative leader who changed this nation and the world\". \"He told us we were somebody and made us believe. I will always cherish him taking me under his wing, and I will forever try to do my part to keep hope alive,\" Sharpton said. Watch: BBC interviews Jesse Jackson in Birmingham in 2013",

    "body": "46 minutes agoSakshi VenkatramanUS reporterGetty ImagesA glove discovered as part of the investigation into Nancy Guthrie's kidnapping has produced no DNA matches, authorities in Pima County, Arizona, say. Found approximately two miles from Guthrie's home, the glove appeared to match one that can be seen on the hand of a suspect in doorbell-camera footage taken the night she went missing.DNA from the glove was sent for testing on Thursday, but produced no matches in CODIS, the FBI's database of DNA from known offenders. Nancy Guthrie, the 84 year-old mother of news anchor Savannah Guthrie, has been missing since 1 February, when investigators believe she was taken from her home against her will. The family has made repeated pleas for her return.The FBI said on Sunday that investigators recovered the glove from a field near the side of the road about two miles (3 km) from Guthrie's home near Tucson, Arizona.The agency collected about 16 gloves from various locations near Nancy Guthrie's home, although most turned out to have been discarded by people searching for her.Last week, investigators released video footage taken from a doorbell camera at Guthrie's front door that showed a masked man wearing gloves and a backpack.In the video, the suspect walks toward the camera and tries to cover it with his gloved hand before grabbing some brush from the front yard to block the camera's view.After conducting a forensic analysis of the video, the FBI said it believed the man was between 5ft 9in and 5ft 10in (175-177cm) tall with an average build.More than two weeks since Guthrie was reported missing, no arrests have been made, the sheriff's department confirmed on Tuesday, adding that more DNA found in the home is being analysed.Authorities also shared that they are working with Walmart to determine who purchased the backpack worn by the suspect in the video. Watch: New video shows masked person outside Nancy Guthrie's homePolice said over the weekend that the Guthrie family, including Nancy Guthrie's children and their spouses, are not suspects in her abduction. Guthrie's three children have posted multiple videos pleading for their mother's safe return in the two weeks since her disappearance, saying they are willing to pay her abductors. Over the weekend, Savannah Guthrie posted one addressing a potential kidnapper directly. \"It is never too late to do the right thing,\" she said. \"We are here and...we believe in the essential goodness of every human being.\"Guthrie was last seen on the evening of 31 January, when a family member dropped her off at her home following a get-together at her daughter Annie Guthrie's house.Members of her church noticed her absence the following day and notified her family.A massive search operation has involved both the Pima County Sheriff's Department and the FBI, who have been combing through Guthrie's home and the surrounding areas.Officials have warned that Guthrie needs regular medication and is \"not in good physical health\". They have said she has no reported cognitive issues.Police have also found blood on the floor of Guthrie's porch - which was confirmed to be hers.The FBI has increased the reward for information about her disappearance from $50,000 (£36,700) to $100,000.",

    "body": "6 hours agoJessica RawnsleyGetty ImagesThe oil tanker, named Grinch, under the watch of the French navy near MarseilleFrance says it has released an oil tanker suspected of being part of Russia's sanctions-busting \"shadow fleet\" after its owner paid a fine.French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said the vessel, Grinch, was \"leaving French waters\" on Tuesday having paid a penalty of \"several million euros\".The tanker was seized by French forces in the Mediterranean in January and then diverted to the port city of Marseille. It had set sail from Murmansk in northern Russia and was flying under a Comoros flag, officials said.Moscow's so-called shadow fleet is a clandestine network of tankers used to evade Western sanctions on Russian oil exports by using aged tankers with obscure ownership or insurance.Many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian oil after it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\"Circumventing European sanctions comes at a price. Russia will no longer be able to finance its war with impunity through a ghost fleet off our coasts,\" Barrot said in a post on X.He added: \"The tanker Grinch will leave French waters after shelling out several million euros and three weeks of costly immobilisation at Fos-sur-Mer. Let's keep it up.\"\"As part of a guilty plea procedure the company that owns the vessel was sentenced by the Marseille judicial court to a financial penalty of confiscation,\" the public prosecutor's office and regional maritime authorities said in a statement.The exact amount the vessel's owner was fined was unclear.While estimates vary, data from the monitoring group TankerTrackers.com suggests the fleet currently consists of 1,468 vessels, roughly triple its size at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine four years ago.The vessels tend to be old and are often poorly maintained. Details of ownership and management are deliberately opaque - names, identification numbers and flags are frequently changed.Efforts have been stepped up to tackle shadow fleets in recent months and a number of sanctioned tankers have been seized.Moscow denounced the move, saying no state had the right to use force against vessels properly registered in other states' jurisdictions.More on this story",

    "body": "16 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThomas Pritzker, 75, said he had exercised \"terrible judgement\"Billionaire Thomas Pritzker says he has retired as the Hyatt Hotels chairman, after his ties with Jeffrey Epstein surfaced in the latest files released by the US Department of Justice.He said in a statement on Monday that he had exercised \"terrible judgement\" in maintaining contact with the convicted sex offender.Recently released files showed that Pritzker was in regular contact with Epstein in the years after the financier's 2008 plea deal on sex crime charges.Pritzker, who has held the role of executive chairman at the global hotel chain since 2004, said he decided to step down after discussions with fellow board members and would not stand for re-election.\"My job and responsibility is to provide good stewardship... Good stewardship includes ensuring a proper transition at Hyatt\", said Pritzker, the billionaire heir to the hotel chain's fortune.He said: \"Good stewardship also means protecting Hyatt, particularly in the context of my association with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell which I deeply regret.\"Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in luring underage girls for Epstein.He was convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a child and died while in custody facing sex trafficking charges in 2019.Pritzker said he condemned the actions of the pair, adding: \"There is no excuse for failing to distance myself sooner.\"His statement was paired with a letter to the board, in which Pritzker points out that he will be 76 this year and that the company is in a \"strong and sustainable position\" with the strength to thrive. He does not mention his links to Epstein or Maxwell in his letter to the board.The board named Mark Hoplamazian, Hyatt's president and chief executive, to take over from Pritzker as chairman.Hoplamazian said Pritzker's decision \"reflects his stewardship and strong commitment\" to Hyatt over decades of service.The release of the Epstein files has revealed the financier's ties to numerous prominent figures in politics, business and academia, many of whom are facing scrutiny.There is no suggestion that appearing in the documents suggests any wrongdoing.Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs' top lawyer, Kathy Ruemmler, announced she would leave the company after emails in the latest tranche of Epstein documents showed she had a close relationship with the financier.Ruemmler has denied having any knowledge of his criminal conduct.Brad Karp, the chairman of US law firm Paul Weiss, also stepped down in February after emails reportedly showed he discussed Epstein's 2008 conviction with him. Paul Weiss has previously said that Karp \"never witnessed or participated in any misconduct\".",

The FBI has not yet responded.AFP via Getty ImagesA memorial was laid out for Alex Pretti a day after he was shot deadMinnesota's BCA said it would \"welcome a joint investigation\" with federal officials. \"The BCA is committed to thorough, independent and transparent investigations of these incidents, even if hampered by a lack of access to key information and evidence,\" it said in a statement.Pretti's family has also pushed for a joint investigation, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.\"Justice and accountability requires a thorough and impartial investigation to establish the facts. A truly joint state and federal investigation would be a welcome development,\" Pretti's family said in a statement.\"It remains unclear if there will be any co-operation or sharing of information related to those two shootings,\" the BCA said.State and federal officials sparred over the course of Operation Metro Surge, an immigration crackdown launched by the Trump administration.It prompted a wave of national protests opposing US President Donald Trump's migration policy and the tactics of ICE.More than 4,000 undocumented immigrants had been arrested, according to Homan, including men he said were convicted of rape and other sexual offences.Minnesota's Democrat Governor Tim Walz said the operation left the state with \"deep damage, generational trauma... and many unanswered questions\".",

    "body": "Ancient bone may prove legendary war elephant crossing of Alps1 day agoGeorgina RannardScience reporterGetty ImagesHannibal's invasion of Europe has acquired almost mythical statusAn elephant foot bone found by archaeologists digging in southern Spain may be evidence that a troop of war elephants stomped through ancient Europe.It would be the first concrete proof of the legendary Carthaginian General Hannibal's troop of battle elephants, according to academics.Drawings of Hannibal's war against the Romans had long suggested that the beasts were used in fighting, but no hard evidence backed up the theories.Now the creatures' skeletal remains appear to have been found in an Iron Age dig near Cordoba.\"Beyond ivory, the discovery of elephant remains in European archaeological contexts is exceptionally rare,\" says the team of scientists in a paper published in Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports.Often considered one of the most successful commanders of classical times, Hannibal led his army from the powerful imperial city Carthage, in modern day Tunisia, into Europe as he battled to control the Mediterranean.It is thought he took soldiers and animals from Carthage through Spain and France to invade Italy, crossing the Alps with 37 elephants in 218 BCE during the second of the so-called Punic Wars.The remains found in Spain are presumed to be from an animal that died before reaching the Alps.The archaeologists, led by Professor Rafael M. Martínez Sánchez, found the elephant's bone beneath a collapsed wall on a site called Colina de los Quemados. Martínez Sánchez et alThe top row is the Iron Age elephant bone found in SpainThey used carbon dating techniques to estimate the age of the 10cm cube-shaped bone. The result led them to believe it is from the Second Punic War.They also compared the bone of modern elephants and steppe mammoths to determine which animal it came from.The team found artillery, coins and ceramics during the excavations in 2020, providing more clues that the place was the site of a battle.\"As non-native species and the largest living terrestrial animals, these imported beasts would have required transportation by ship,\" the academics said.They say that it is very unlikely that dead animals were transported, and the bones are unattractive suggesting they were not decorative or used in craft.But the scientists say it will be very challenging to work out which species of elephant the creature was.\"While [the bone] would not represent one of the mythical specimens Hannibal took across the Alps, it could potentially embody the first known relic − so sought after by European scholars of the Modern Age − of the animals used in the Punic Roman wars for the control of the Mediterranean,\" the scientists conclude in their paper.",

I've got combat experience, that's kind of rare. I spent 25 years in the military,\" he said.He added: \"It's a serious decision. I just haven't made it yet.\"Kelly, 61, and five other lawmakers, who had all either served in the military or had roles in intelligence, have been targeted by the government after they published a 90-second video encouraging troops to disobey orders they deemed illegal. It was released at the time of rising questions of the legality regarding American strikes on alleged narco-trafficking boats off the coast of South America.But Kelly said he expected Trump to continue his legal action against him.He added: \"This is not going to end by me going away. I'm going to continue to fight this thing even if it goes all the way to the Supreme Court.\"Critics of the Trump administration have called the government's crackdown on the six lawmakers an attack on free speech and said it was another instance of the president seeking to punish those he perceives as political enemies.\"Donald Trump, is so reckless about what he says,\" he said. \"There are folks out there that, you know, react to what he said and people listen to him.\"The BBC has contacted the White House for comment.Among the other Democrats considering a presidential run are Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump in 2024, and California Governor Gavin Newsom. Ina BBC interview in October, Harris said she would \"possibly\" be president one day and was confident there would be a woman in the White House in future.However, he has also suggested vice-president JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as potential successors, calling them \"unstoppable\".",

    "body": "1 day agoCBS via Getty ImagesDuvall played mafia consigliere Tom Hagen in The Godfather and The Godfather Part II Robert Duvall was a distinguished and prolific screen actor who lent a brooding intensity and grizzled authority to seven decades of American film-making.Nominated for Academy Awards on seven occasions, he won best actor for his role as a troubled country singer in 1983's Tender Mercies.His many other roles included a mafia consigliere in The Godfather, a bombastic army officer in Apocalypse Now, and a Texas Ranger-turned-cattle driver in Lonesome Dove.More character actor than leading man, he could be relied upon to inject a feisty, fiery machismo and a cantankerous contrariness into the most mainstream Hollywood offering.Born Robert Selden Duvall in January 1931 in San Diego, California, Duvall was a self-proclaimed \"navy brat\" due to his father's life-long career in the United States Navy.His father expected him to follow him into the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. Yet his son instead served two years in the army following his 1953 college graduation.Getty ImagesDuvall and Dustin Hoffman, pictured in 2014, studied acting together in the 1950sDuvall subsequently moved to New York to study acting, working as a postal clerk to make ends meet. His classmates included Dustin Hoffman and Gene Hackman, who both became lifelong friends.\"A friend is someone who many years ago offered you his last $300 when you broke your pelvis,\" he would later recall. \"A friend is Gene Hackman.\"Duvall began acting professionally at the Gateway Playhouse, a summer theatre in Long Island, where he starred in plays by Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams and others.His performance in Horton Foote's one-act play The Midnight Caller led the playwright to recommend him for the role of Boo Radley in the 1962 film version of To Kill a Mockingbird.By that time, Duvall had already appeared on television in such shows as Naked City, Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Armstrong Circle Theatre.To Kill a Mockingbird, which Foote adapted from Harper Lee's novel, was the actor's first film role and led to appearances in such films as The Chase, Bullitt and True Grit.Getty ImagesDuvall played the reclusive Boo Radley in To Kill a MockingbirdThe Rain People, released in 1969, marked his first collaboration with director Francis Ford Coppola, with whom he would go on to work in the first two Godfather films.Other significant roles around this time included the highly strung Major Burns in Robert Altman's M*A*S*H and THX 1138, the eponymous protagonist of George Lucas's dystopian 1971 sci-fi debut.Duvall's performance as The Godfather's Tom Hagen, the shrewd chief advisor to Marlon Brando's ageing Don Vito Corleone, earned him his first Academy Award nomination in 1973.He reprised the role in 1974's The Godfather Part II, by which time he had collaborated with Foote again in the 1972 film of his play Tomorrow. Network, from 1976, cast him as a venal television producer.Meanwhile, there were appearances with Michael Caine in The Eagle Has Landed, Laurence Olivier in The Betsy, and Muhammad Ali in the boxer's biopic The Greatest.Getty ImagesRobert Duvall (centre) on the Apocalypse Now setIn 1979, Duvall gave perhaps his most memorable performance as Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore in Coppola's Vietnam war epic Apocalypse Now.\"I love the smell of napalm in the morning,\" his character famously declared after leading a deadly helicopter attack on a Vietnamese village.The actor was shown to no less domineering effect in The Great Santini, playing a frustrated Marine pilot who hectors and browbeats his teenage children.The scene in which he torments his son by bouncing a basketball against his head was spoofed by Mike Myers' Dr Evil in the second Austin Powers film.Duvall's work in Apocalypse Now and The Great Santini saw him nominated for Oscars in consecutive years. The former also earned him a Bafta and the first of four Golden Globe awards.Yet it was his role as alcoholic singer Mac Sledge in Tender Mercies that finally saw him land an Oscar, beating an all-British line-up of fellow nominees that included Caine and Albert Finney.Watch: Robert Duvall honoured in Hollywood 'hand and footprint ceremony' in 2011Duvall's other Oscar nominations came for his performances in 1997's The Apostle, 1998 legal drama A Civil Action and 2014's The Judge.In The Apostle, which he also wrote and directed, the actor played an evangelical preacher who begins a new life in Louisiana after committing a crime.In real life, Duvall attended church regularly during his childhood but was reluctant to discuss his faith, merely disclosing he had \"always been a believer\".The staunch Republican was less reticent about his political persuasions and was a guest at President George W Bush's inauguration in 2001.Duvall's other many screen roles included an LA police office in Colors, an astronaut in Deep Impact, and a Nascar crew chief in Days of Thunder alongside Tom Cruise.He was reunited with Cruise in 2012's Jack Reacher, in which Duvall played a former soldier turned gun shop owner.Yet Duvall often looked happiest when riding a horse, be it in the acclaimed TV mini-series Lonesome Dove or in the Kevin Costner Western Open Range.\"I think the Western kind of defines us,\" the actor said in 2016. \"The English have Shakespeare; the French, Moliere; the Russians have Chekhov. But the Western is ours.\"Getty ImagesDuvall was named best actor at the 1984 Academy AwardsHis other passions included football, the tango and the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, a city he professed to love \"more than any place else\".\"A young actor once asked me 'What do you do between jobs?'\" he once recalled. \"I said, 'Hobbies, hobbies and more hobbies'. It keeps you off dope.\"Duvall was married and divorced three times and is survived by his fourth wife, the Argentine actress Luciana Pedraza. He did not father any children, commenting in 2003 that it had \"never worked out\".",

He had led Zambia from 2015 until 2021, when he lost elections by a huge margin to current President Hakainde Hichilema.The Zambian government wants Lungu's remains to be repatriated and given a state funeral, with full state honours - and a South African court ruled in its favour in August.But Lungu's family want a private burial in South Africa as they say the former president had not wanted Hichilema to attend his funeral. The relationship between the two politicians had long been fraught.In the letter to the South African police, dated 11 February 2026, Mashele Attorneys confirmed that on behalf of the Lungu family it had \"complied with the five subpoenas issued\" in relation to a criminal probe looking into allegations that the former Zambian president was poisoned.\"For the avoidance of doubt, it is our clients' instruction that the allegations underlying the criminal case are denied,\" the letter said.Neo Mashele, from Mashele Attorneys, told the BBC the investigation by police appeared to be based on a \"public utterance\" about a poisoning allegation made by one of Lungu's daughters that was \"absolutely not true\".In its letter, Mashele Attorneys also raised concern over another subpoena it said had been issued by police to the funeral home looking after Lungu's body.It said there were two High Court orders that directed that \"possession and custody of the body remain with Two Mountains Funeral Services pending the finalisation of the legal proceedings\".\"Those orders are binding and operative,\" the letter said.An official from the morgue where the remains are being stored told the BBC that Lungu's body was \"under tight security [and] surveillance 24/7\".Mrs Lungu has remained in South Africa since the death of her husband and is leading legal efforts to have him buried in South Africa.Additional reporting by Nomsa MasekoYou may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "1 day agoTom BennettReutersMany have been held in Roj camp for nearly seven years, since IS lost its last territorial foothold in Syria in 2019A group of 34 Australian women and children who have been held in a camp in northern Syria for nearly seven years due to their links to the Islamic State (IS) group were released on Monday to head home, but then returned to the camp for \"technical reasons\".The group - thought by authorities to be the wives and children of IS fighters - have been stuck in Roj detention camp until now, with the Australian government refusing to officially repatriate them.It is unclear why their release was halted, but Australian media has reported it may have been due to a failure to coordinate the correct permissions between the factions governing the region. Their future - and that of thousands of other IS relatives in Syria - remains unclear. Other foreign governments have also refused to repatriate their citizens.Reuters news agency quoted a co-director of Roj camp as saying that the 34 Australians had been handed over to members of their families who had travelled to Syria for their release, and had boarded minibuses to travel to Damascus with a military escort.Australian media reported that the group were intending to continue their journey to Beirut, where they hoped to be issued passports. The Australian government has repeatedly said it would not repatriate people from Syria and said those who returned who had committed crimes would be \"met with the full force of the law\".But it has previously taken the position that it is obliged to issue passports to citizens who present themselves at an Australian embassy.Roj is home to more than 2,000 others from 40 different nationalities - mainly women and children - who have been held there since IS was driven from its final foothold in Syria in 2019.Among them is thought to be Shamima Begum, who was stripped of her British citizenship in 2019 on national security grounds.BBC's Orla Guerin reported from Roj camp last monthSpeaking to Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), the camp's director, Hakmiyeh Ibrahim said: \"My message is not only to Australia but to all countries: take your citizens, take these children and women\". She added that children were growing up surrounded by \"dangerous ideas and ideologies\" in the camp.\"We brought families of ISIS-affiliated women and children here in 2017 and now it's 2026,\" she said. \"The more time passes, the more complicated the situation becomes.\"The Australian government said in a statement: \"Our security agencies have been monitoring - and continue to monitor - the situation in Syria to ensure they are prepared for any Australians seeking to return to Australia\".\"People in this cohort need to know that if they have committed a crime and if they return to Australia they will be met with the full force of the law.\"The safety of Australians and the protection of Australia's national interests remain the overriding priority.\"Last month the UK home secretary said she would \"robustly defend\" the decision to remove Shamima Begum's citizenship, according to a government source.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has called for an investigation, but the government source said the decision had already been upheld by UK courts.Ms Begum was 15 when she travelled from east London to the Middle East, to a territory held by the Islamic State group, where she married a fighter.",

    "body": "A Canadian man has lost a 16-year legal battle to reclaim more than C$1.2m (£651,000) in cash seized from his home.Police found the large amount of money stashed in various places around Marcel Breton's north-western Ontario home during a search for an illegal firearm in 2009, as well as a variety of drugs.Breton was convicted of various offences but was acquitted at a retrial after arguing the search of his property had not been lawful.But earlier this week, an Ontario appeals court upheld a 2023 ruling that decided most of the seized money should go to the Canadian government, putting an end to his chances of recouping it.The trial judge had concluded that Breton did not lawfully possess the cash found around his property.Police recovered C$1,235,620 buried under his garage, C$32,000 stored elsewhere in the garage, and bundles of money totalling $15,000 in the under-floor heating ducts of the living room.In particular, the trial judge noted that it was \"unusual for an average person to have such a large amount of money buried in tubs underneath their property\", that the most common denomination was C$20 - an amount an expert said was commonly associated with the drug trade - and that the cash was found near drugs and drug paraphernalia.Breton also did not report any income to the revenue agency between 2001 and 2008, the judge said.But the appeals court upheld the decision for the $15,000 found inside the vents of his home to be returned to him, as the judge could not rule out that it had been obtained lawfully as it was not bundled in consistent denominations like the cash found in the garage.",

At least 10 students were injured in a stampede as they tried to leave Dhaka University on Friday.\"We have never experienced an earthquake this powerful in the last five years,\" said the country's environmental adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan.At least three people were killed when a railing and debris fell from a five-storey building in Dhaka's Armanitola area, deputy police commissioner Mallik Ahsan Uddin Sami said.Nitai Chandra De Sarkar, director of the department's monitoring division, said 461 people have been reported injured across the country, including 252 in the Gazipur district, north of Dhaka.Sarker told the BBC: \"Our main task at the moment is to assess casualties and damage. We are not yet seeing the challenge of rescue from the rubble or debris management at that level.\"Bengali Sadman Sakib told Reuters news agency: \"I have never felt such tremor in my 30 years of life. We were at the office when the furniture started shaking.\"We rushed down the stairs on the street and saw other people on the road already.\"A student called Abdullah, who was sleeping at the time of the earthquake, told Reuters the \"whole building was shaking\".Abdul Goni/Anadolu via Getty ImagesTremors were felt in eastern Indian states bordering Bangladesh, but there were no reports of major damage.The earthquake caused Ireland's second cricket test match in Bangladesh to stop temporarily.Coaches and players not involved gathered at the boundary, while those in the stands took shelter. The game was stopped for three minutes but play soon resumed.Ireland's head coach Heinrich Malan said: \"I've been involved in a couple of earthquakes from my time living in New Zealand.\"It's never a nice feeling and you're trying to understand what is happening in the moment around you, but also the bigger impacts about where the earthquake struck.\"Everything stood still for a couple of minutes and we got back to business, but we're thinking of everyone and hoping there wasn't too much damage done.\"",

    "body": "13 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterA surrealist painting by famed Mexican artist Frida Kahlo has sold for $54.7m (£41.8m) - shattering the auction record for an artwork by a woman. The painting, from the 1940s, went for more than 1,000 times its original auction price in 1980, after a tense bidding battle between two collectors, according to the auction house Sotheby's.The work - titled El sueño (la cama), which is translated to The dream (The bed)  - depicts Kahlo asleep in a canopy bed beneath a skeleton entwined with dynamite.The auction broke the previous record figure for a female artist's work of $44m, as well as for the highest amount paid for a Kahlo portrait - $34.9 million in 2021.The self-portrait is one of Kahlo's \"psychologically charged\" artworks, Sotheby's said, and was painted during a turbulent chapter in her life - the year her former lover was assassinated, and shortly after her divorce and remarriage.Kahlo, who died in 1954, is widely regarded as one of the greatest painters in the past century and became known for her personal portraits.Her work often conveyed her painful relationship with her body, disabled through polio in her childhood and serious injuries following a bus accident.Few could have imagined El sueño (la cama) would eventually sell for $55m when it was first went under the hammer at Sotheby's for $51,000 in 1980, the auction house's head of Latin American art Anna Di Stasi said. \"This record-breaking result shows just how far we have come, not only in our appreciation of Frida Kahlo's genius, but in the recognition of women artists at the very highest level of the market,\" she added.The previous highest price at auction for a work by a female artist is Georgia O'Keeffe's Jimson Weed / White Flower No.1, which was sold at Sotheby's in 2014 for $44m.El sueño (la cama) is one of the few Kahlo paintings in the public market since the Mexican authorities declared her artworks as artistic monuments in the 1980s, preventing them from being exported without authorisation.Kahlo's story was adapted into a biographical film starring Salma Hayek in 2002, telling the story of her rocky relationship with her husband, artist Diego Rivera, and her injuries.",

    "body": "1 hour agoGeorgina RannardClimate and science correspondent, in Belém, BrazilGetty ImagesMembers of the Ipereg Ayu movement, representing the indigenous Munduruku group, demoonstrated outside this year's summitAll mention of fossil fuels, by far the largest contributor to climate change, has been dropped from the draft deal under negotiation as the COP30 UN climate talks in Belém, Brazil enter their final stretch.Draft agreements at the meeting of nearly 200 countries usually go through multiple revisions as all parties must agree in order for a deal to pass.Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and some countries including the UK want the summit to commit countries to stronger, faster action to reduce their use of fossil fuels.An earlier text included three possible routes to achieve this, but that language has now been dropped after opposition from oil-producing nations.A group of countries including the UK have published a letter rejecting the new draft deal.\"We express deep concern regarding the current proposal under consideration for a take it or leave it,\" it said.\"We cannot support an outcome that does not include a roadmap for implementing a just, orderly and equitable transition away from fossil fuels.\" A source close to the negotiations said that Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations are blocking the fossil fuel deal. The BBC has approached Saudi Arabia for comment.French Environment Minister Monique Barbut said the deal is being blocked by \"oil-producing countries - Russia, India, Saudi Arabia, but joined by many emerging countries.\"She suggested that small island nations may agree to a weaker deal on fossil fuels if they secured more finance to adapt to the changes in their countries caused by rising temperatures.On France's position she said:\"At this point, even if we don't have the roadmap, but at least a mention of the fossil fuels, I think we would accept it. But as it stands now, we have nothing left.\"Dropping the language is likely to be a negotiating tactic to raise the temperature at the talks and force countries to come to agreement.The meeting is a fraught and delicate diplomatic process as countries jostle to protect their national interests, while also attempting to address the issue of climate change.Some observers question the value of the complex, legalistic talks which almost always over-run. But others point to the significant advances in measures to tackle climate change, including renewable energy, electric vehicles, and protection of nature in recent years linked to COP agreements. Other issues discussed at the COP include the gap in climate finance promised by richer nations to developing nations that are most impacted by climate change.The new draft deal called for global efforts to triple financing available to countries by 2030. But it did not say if this should come from richer nations or from other sources, like the private sector.This could anger poorer countries who want stronger support from richer nations and heavily criticised a deal at last year's COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, which they considered paltry.gettyBrazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, wants the summit to commit countries to stronger, faster action to reduce their use of fossil fuelsDeforestation has been been a fraught issue at the meeting, which takes place on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon.The new draft also weakened language around tackling deforestation. \"For a COP hosted in the Amazon, it's shattering that deforestation is taking a back seat,\" said Kelly Dent, Director of External Engagement for World Animal Protection.\"The wildlife and indigenous people who call the forest their home deserve better than this.\"The two-week meeting has been interrupted by two evacuations. Last week a group of protesters broke into the COP venue in Belém carrying signs reading \"Our forests are not for sale\".On Thursday a fire broke out, burning a hole through the sheeting covering the venue and causing 13 smoke inhalation injuries. The summit was evacuated and closed for at least six hours.The summit has been praised for including the largest number yet of delegates from indigenous groups.",

    "body": "7 hours agoMatt SpiveyGetty ImagesMaría Corina Machado has been in hiding since the start of the yearVenezuela's opposition leader will be considered a \"fugitive\" if she travels to Norway to collect her Nobel Peace Prize, the nation's attorney general has said.Tarik William Saab told news agency AFP that María Corina Machado - who has been living in hiding to avoid arrest - was accused of \"acts of conspiracy, incitement of hatred, and terrorism\".The 58-year-old was named as the prestigious prize's recipient in October, being praised for her efforts towards a \"peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy\".She has long denounced President Nicolás Maduro's government as \"criminal\" and called on Venezuelans to unite to depose it. Many nations view his rule as illegitimate.Machado - who has long been one of the most respected voices in Venezuela's opposition - was barred from running in last year's presidential elections, in which Maduro won a third six-year term in office.The elections were widely dismissed on the international stage as neither free nor fair, and sparked protests across the country.Despite her barring, Machado was able to unite Venezuela's opposition behind her little-known surrogate on the ballot, Edmundo González.The government-controlled National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner - even though tallies from polling stations showed that González had won by a landslide.González later fled to Spain, fearing repression. This was followed by attempts to detain other opposition officials.The Nobel Committee, when announcing the recipient of the prize at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo, hailed Machado as \"one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times\".Nobel chairman Jørgen Watne Frydnes said at the time he hoped Machado would be able to attend an award ceremony in Oslo on 10 December, but acknowledged the serious security situation she faced.Machado expressed shock at winning the prize, saying: \"I am just one person. I certainly do not deserve this.\"She added that it was the \"achievement of a whole society\".Getty ImagesMachado has long been a staunch critic of President Nicolás Maduro (pictured)Among the leaders to congratulate her at the time was US President Donald Trump, who was also up for the award and whom tensions with Maduro's government have become increasingly strained. Attorney General Saab also said Machado was under investigation for her support of the deployment of US military forces in the Caribbean.The Trump administration has launched an operation targeting boats, mostly in the Caribbean, it accuses of transporting drugs from South America to the US. More than 80 people have been killed in the strikes, most of whom were Venezuelan.Trump has accused Maduro of being the leader of a drugs cartel, something the Venezuelan leader has denied.Maduro has, in turn, accused Trump of trying to incite a war to gain control of Venezuela's oil reserves, but recently said he was willing to hold face-to-face talks with representatives of the Trump administration.Meanwhile, Machado has been trying to encourage the Venezuelan military to switch sides and turn on Maduro, outlining her vision for a post-Maduro Venezuela in what she called a \"freedom manifesto\" in a video posted on Tuesday.\"We stand at the edge of a new era - one where our natural rights will prevail,\" she told viewers.",

    "body": "14 hours agoVictoria GillScience correspondentThe \"swarm\" of tens of thousands of earthquakes near the Greek island of Santorini earlier this year was triggered by molten rock pumping through an underground channel over three months, scientists have discovered.They used physics and artificial intelligence to work out exactly what caused the more than 25,000 earthquakes, which travelled about 20km (12 miles) horizontally through the Earth's crust. They used each of the tremors as virtual sensors, then used artificial intelligence to analyse patterns associated with them.One of the lead researchers, Dr Stephen Hicks from UCL, said combining physics and machine learning in this way could help forecast volcanic eruptions.The seismic activity started to stir beneath the Greek islands of Santorini, Amorgos, and Anafi in January 2025. The islands experienced tens of thousands of earthquakes - many of which were over magnitude 5.0 and could be felt.Many tourists fled, and locals feared that the nearby underwater volcano, Kolumbo, might be about to erupt -  or that this was a seismic prelude to a larger earthquake, like the devastating, magnitude 7.7 quake that struck the same region in 1956.The scientists, who published their findings in the journal Science, created a 3D map of the Earth around Santorini. They then mapped the evolving patterns of seismic activity of each tremor and the movement and stress in the crust. This resulted in a detailed model of exactly what drove this months-long seismic swarm.The team found that the event was driven by the horizontal movement of magma - from beneath Santorini and the Kolumbo volcano - through a 30km channel that is more than 10km beneath the seafloor between the two islands of Santorini and Anydros.The researchers estimated that the volume of magma that moved through the crust could have filled 200,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. These \"magma intrusions\", as they are known, smashed through layers of rock, triggering thousands of tremors. Lead author on the study, Anthony Lomax, a research geophysicist who develops scientific software to analyse seismic activity, explained: \"The tremors act as if we had instruments deep in the Earth, and they're telling us something.\"[When we analyse] the pattern those earthquakes make in our 3D model of the Earth, it matches very, very well what we expect for magma moving horizontally.\"For now, the researchers say, it appears to be over.\"The magma remained quite deep - more than 8km depth - in the crust,\" explained Dr Hicks. \"We know that magma can ascend and erupt at the surface in a matter of hours to days, but because the activity has now died down, we can be almost certain that the melt eventually got stuck and cooled down deep in the crust.\"Volcanoes, though, can enter prolonged phases of unrest and unpredictability that can last many years. Recent volcanic activity in south-west Iceland has demonstrated that.And these researchers say using AI, in combination with the fundamental physics of how the Earth's crust moves and responds to stress, could transform the ability to monitor, understand and even forecast volcanic activity. This could help keep people in seismically active parts of the world safe.\"Ultimately, this could be used as a forecasting tool,\" explained Dr Hicks. Whenever we see a cluster of earthquakes, \"that is data that can be used to work out the most likely cause\".",

    "body": "Spain's Attorney General, Álvaro García Ortiz, has been forced to step down after being found guilty of revealing confidential information in a deeply controversial case, which accentuated the country's political division.The Supreme Court found that García Ortiz had unlawfully revealed details of the tax status of businessman Alberto González Amador, boyfriend of a senior conservative politician. The court handed him a two-year ban from the post and a fine of €7,200 (£6,438). He must also pay €10,000 to Mr González Amador as compensation.The trial of García Ortiz fuelled already acrimonious relations between the left-wing government of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and right-wing opposition.Their contrasting positions were underlined by reactions to the conviction.\"Sánchez must apologise to Spaniards, resign and call elections, in that order,\" said Ester Muñoz, spokeswoman for the conservative People's Party.The government said it did not agree with the ruling but respected it and would proceed with the appointment of a new attorney general.However, a number of politicians on the left expressed outrage at what they saw as a politically motivated ruling.Health Minister Mónica García, of the Sumar party, said the conviction dealt a \"lethal blow to [the concept of] presumption of innocence\" and threw ordinary Spaniards \"under the bus\" when it came to the rule of law.The complex case dates back to March 2024, when the attorney general's office issued a press release stating that Mr González Amador had requested a plea bargain after being found to have evaded tax payments worth €350,951. The document corrected mistaken press reports stating that the attorney general's office had proposed the bargain.The source of the incorrect reports was the head of communications of the conservative regional president of Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso. Ms Díaz Ayuso is the partner of Mr González Amador.Mr González Amador filed a complaint against the attorney general, claiming his privacy had been breached. The case against García Ortiz also saw him accused of leaking information about the affair to the media. Prosecutors pointed to the attorney general's decision to change his phone as incriminating.However, there was no direct evidence linking García Ortiz to the leak and several journalists testified during the trial that he had not been the source of their information. Regarding the press statement, the attorney general said he was simply correcting the erroneous reports.García Ortiz can appeal against the ruling.This comes as a severe blow for the prime minister, who has been under judicial pressure on various fronts. His brother is due to go on trial for influence peddling, his wife is under investigation for her business activities and two former senior figures in the Socialist Party, José Luis Ábalos and Santos Cerdán, are accused of overseeing a massive kickback scheme.",

    "body": "19 minutes agoSteve RosenbergRussia editorIt was quite a contrast.On Thursday, a US Pentagon delegation was in Kyiv. They were talking to President Zelensky about a draft plan to end the war in Ukraine.The same day, on Russian state TV, President Putin was in military fatigues. He was talking to his army chiefs about fighting on.\"We have our tasks, our goals,\" the Kremlin leader declared. \"The chief one is the unconditional achievement of the aims of the special military operation.\"The Izvestia newspaper called President Putin's visit to a command post \"a signal to America that he's prepared to negotiate on Ukraine, on Russia's terms.\"Which brings us back to the peace plan.The Kremlin claims it \"hasn't received anything official\" from Washington. But a 28-point proposal has been widely leaked and reported on - and widely interpreted as favouring Russia's peace terms.What's more, the reported plan appeared after a visit to America by President Putin's envoy Kirill Dmitriev. He took part in three days of discussions in Miami with President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff.According to drafts of the peace proposal widely available, Ukraine would cede to Russia parts of the Donbass still under Kyiv's control; the Ukrainian armed forces would be reduced in size and Ukraine would vow not to join Nato.The Kremlin won't confirm the contents. But it's advising Kyiv to agree terms.\"The Russian military's effective work should convince Zelensky and his regime that it's better to strike a deal and do it now,\" President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists on a Kremlin conference call.A peace proposal does not automatically mean peace. What if there's no agreement?Pro-Kremlin commentators insist that, deal or no deal, Russia will prevail.\"Everyone thought that the idea of a peace deal had sunk in a swamp,\" wrote Russian news outlet Moskovsky Komsomolets. \"But suddenly, a rocket has shot out of this bog with a new, or rather an 'old new' peace plan, with something of the Alaska summit about it. It shot out like a jack in the box.\"How long and how far will this missile fly? Will it crash, sabotaged by Europe and Kyiv? Even if the launch is a false start, it's unlikely to change the general trend. The balance of power is shifting in Russia's favour.\"But after nearly four years of war Russia is under pressure, too. Since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, not only has Russian's army suffered huge losses on the battlefield, but back home the economy is faltering. Russia's budget deficit is growing, revenues from oil and gas falling.\"Russia's industry is somewhere between stagnation and decline,\" declared the broadsheet Nezavisimaya Gazeta this week.It's unclear, though, whether economic pressures will change President Putin's calculations and convince him that now is the moment to end his so-called special operation: even on terms that many believe benefit Moscow.Many. But not everyone.Some elements of the peace plan haven't gone down well in Russia. Some reports suggest that Ukraine could be offered security guarantees modelled on Nato's Article 5. That might commit Western allies to treat any future Russian attack on Ukraine as an attack on the transatlantic community as a whole and trigger a combined military response.\"This is, in effect, Ukraine in Nato,\" wrote Moskovsky Komsomolets, \"only without the deployment of bases and weapons on its territory.\"The full details of the peace plan have yet to be confirmed. We may be entering another period of intense diplomacy.For now, though, Russia's war on Ukraine continues.",

    "body": "Raccoons may be inching closer to becoming America's next pet.Affectionately referred to as trash pandas, the masked mammals known for rummaging rubbish bins for easy food, are evolving based on their proximity to humans, even starting to look cuter, a new study says. Evaluation of nearly 20,000 photos found \"a clear reduction in snout length\" in urban raccoons compared to their rural cousins - a physical shift consistent with the early stages of domestication seen in cats and dogs.Some that have been adopted as pets have become TikTok celebrities. One particularly bold dumpster-diver even sprinted across the pitch during a Major League Soccer match in Philadelphia last year.The stripe-tailed mammals, also nicknamed \"backyard bandits\", are widespread across the contiguous US. Their ability to thrive in both wild and urban settings has left them occupying an unusual space in American life - beloved pet in some neighbourhoods, persistent pest in others.The proximity to humans could signal that the creatures are growing more comfortable around us, or, scientifically speaking, dampening their innate flight responses, according to the study published in the journal Frontiers in Zoology.The softening of their features could be due to shifts in their fight-or-flight response on the cellular level, it says.This urban domestication starts with trash, the study's co-author, Raffaela Lesch of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, told Scientific American.\"Trash is really the kickstarter,\" she said. \"Wherever humans go, there's trash — and animals love our trash.\"But to take advantage of this endless buffet, wildlife must strike a delicate balance: bold enough to root through bins and navigate human environments, yet not so bold as to pose a threat. \"If you have an animal that lives close to humans, you have to be well-behaved enough,\" Lesch said. \"That selection pressure is quite intense.\"The finding, the authors said, is consistent with the \"domestication syndrome phenotype\". Domestication syndrome - anatomical and morphological changes such as curly tails, floppy ears, depigmentation, smaller brains and reduced facial skeletons - are commonly cited as some of the most salient traits, the study says. Those traits are also seen among more common household pets, such as dogs that evolved from wolves.The study's authors also hypothesised that the domestication process is wrongly believed to be initiated by humans, who have captured or selectively bred animals in the past. The process might actually begin much earlier than previously thought, they said, notably when animals became habituated to human environments.\"Only animals with dampened flight (or fight) responses would succeed best,\" the authors wrote. \"This makes the initial stages of the domestication process a process of pure natural selection.\"",

    "body": "More than 250 people have been arrested in Charlotte, North Carolina, as part of President Donald Trump's escalating crackdown on undocumented immigration, US officials say. Charlotte is the latest US city that Trump has targeted with federal troops, following similar measures in bigger cities like Chicago and Los Angeles earlier this year. Officials with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) told the BBC that those arrested are criminals and gang members.But local lawmakers and residents have railed against the detainments, which the federal government has dubbed \"Operation Charlotte's Web\". The state's Democratic governor has alleged people are being targeted because of their race. In a statement released on Wednesday, a DHS spokesperson said the operation has led to the arrest of \"some of the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens\", including gang members. Others arrested had been convicted of a range of crimes, including assault on law enforcement, driving while intoxicated, theft and tampering with government documents, the department said earlier.North Carolina's Democratic Governor Josh Stein, who has denounced Trump's operations, accused agents of racially profiling residents. \"We've seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin colour, racially profiling and picking up random people in parking lots,\" Stein said on Sunday. \"This is not making us safer.\"The city's mayor, also a Democrat, urged federal agents to operate with \"respect\" for the city's values. She also commended those who came out in droves on Saturday to protest the Trump administration's actions in the city. \"I am deeply concerned with many of the videos I've seen,\" Mayor Vi Lyles said. \"To everyone in Charlotte who is feeling anxious or fearful: you are not alone. Your city stands with you.\" DHS has not said how long the raids will last. Chicago's crackdown started in September and is still ongoing. Like other cities subject to immigration crackdowns, some migrants in Charlotte are staying home for fear of federal agents in the city, according to local media reports.Stein says he's monitoring reports that the operation will come to Raleigh, another North Carolina city, next. \"Once again, I call on federal agents to target violent criminals, not neighbors walking down the street, going to church, or putting up Christmas decorations,\" he wrote.",

    "body": "11 hours agoTom BatemanState Department correspondent, Washington DCCountries enforcing race or gender diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies will now be at risk of the Trump administration deeming them as infringing on human rights.The State Department is issuing the new rules to all US embassies and consulates involved in compiling its annual report on global human rights abuses.The new instructions also deem countries that subsidise abortion or facilitate mass migration as infringing on human rights.The changes, which the State Department says are intended to stop \"destructive ideologies\", have been condemned by rights campaigners who argue the Trump administration is re-defining long-established human rights principles to pursue ideological goals.The changes reflect a major shift in Washington's established focus on global human rights protection, and signal the expansion into foreign policy of the Trump administration's domestic agenda on issues that have become a lightning rod of division in the US over recent years.A senior State Department official said the new rules were \"a tool to change the behaviour of governments\".DEI policies were designed with the objective of improving outcomes for specific racial and identity-based groups. Since assuming office, US President Donald Trump has aggressively sought to terminate DEI and restore what he calls merit-based opportunity in the US.The senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: \"The United States remains committed to the Declaration of Independence's recognition that all men are endowed by the Creator with certain unalienable rights.\" The official added that rights were \"given to us by God, our creator, not by governments\".Other policies by foreign governments which US embassies will be told to categorise as human rights infringements include:Subsidising abortions, \"as well as the total estimated number of annual abortions\"Gender-transition surgery for children, defined by the state department as \"operations involving chemical or surgical mutilation... to modify their sex\"Facilitating mass or illegal migration \"across a country's territory into other countries\"Arrests or \"official investigations or warnings for speech\" - a reference to the Trump administration's opposition to internet safety laws adopted by some European countries to deter online hate speechState Department deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said the new instructions are intended to stop \"new destructive ideologies [that] have given safe harbour to human rights violations\".He said: \"The Trump administration will not allow these human rights violations, such as the mutilation of children, laws that infringe on free speech, and racially discriminatory employment practices, to go unchecked.\" He added: \"Enough is enough.\"Critics have accused the administration of redefining long-established universal human rights principles to pursue its own ideological goals.Uzra Zeya, a former senior State Department official who now runs the charity Human Rights First, said the Trump administration was \"weaponising international human rights for domestic partisan ends\". \"Attempting to label DEI as a human rights violation sets a new low in the Trump administration's weaponization of international human rights,\" she said.She added that the new instructions excluded the rights of \"women, LGBTQI+ persons, religious and ethnic minorities, and non-believers - all of whom enjoy equal rights under US and international law, despite the meandering and obtuse rights rhetoric of the Trump Administration\".The new rules conveyed \"jaw-dropping\" animosity towards LGBTQI+ people, Ms Zeya added. The State Department's annual human rights report has been seen historically as the most comprehensive study of its kind by any government. It has documented abuses, including torture, extrajudicial killing and political persecution of minorities. Much of its focus and scope had remained broadly similar across Republican and Democrat administrations.The new instructions follow the Trump administration's publication of the latest annual report in August, which was significantly rewritten and downscaled compared to those of previous years.It reduced criticism of some US allies while escalating disapproval of perceived foes. Entire sections included in reports from previous years were eliminated, dramatically reducing coverage of issues including government corruption and persecution of LGBTQ+ individuals.The report also said the human rights situation had \"worsened\" in some European democracies, including the UK, France and Germany, due to laws against online hate speech. The language in the report echoed previous criticism by some US tech bosses who oppose online harm reduction laws, portraying them as attacks on free speech.",

    "body": "24 hours agoMansur AbubakarAbujaReutersKanu was not in court when the verdict was delivered, after being removed for unruly behaviourA court in Nigeria has found separatist leader Nnamdi Kanu guilty of terrorism and other charges following a decade-long legal case full of drama.He has been given four life sentences, along with other terms, to be served concurrently. The prosecution had called for the death penalty but Judge James Omotosho said that executions were now \"frowned upon\".In his ruling he said he was satisfied that Kanu had made a series of broadcasts to incite violence and killings, as part of his campaign for a separate state in south-east Nigeria, known as Biafra.Kanu was convicted on all seven charges he faced. As well as terrorism, they included treason and involvement with an outlawed movement.Kanu always denied the charges and challenged the court's jurisdiction. At the start of the trial he sacked his lawyers but refused to defend himself.He was not in court when the verdict was delivered, after being removed for unruly behaviour.Security around the courthouse in the capital, Abuja, was tightened ahead of the verdict in case of protests by Kanu's supporters.Once a relatively obscure figure, he came to national prominence in 2009 when he started Radio Biafra, a station that called for an independent state for the Igbo people, broadcast to Nigeria from London.Though he grew up in south-eastern Nigeria, where he attended the University of Nsukka, Kanu moved to the UK before graduating, and acquired British nationality.In 2014, he set up the Indigenous People Of Biafra (Ipob), a movement demanding independence.Ipob was banned as a terrorist organisation in 2017. Its armed wing - the Eastern Security Network - has been accused of killings and other acts of violence in recent years.Delivering his judgement, Justice Omotosho said: \"Mr Kanu knew what he was doing, he was bent on carrying out these threats without consideration to his own people.\"From the incontroverted evidence, it is clear that the defendant carried out preparatory act of terrorism.\"He had the duty to explain himself but failed to do so.\"Kanu is a popular figure in his movement's heartland in south-eastern Nigeria, but reaction to the verdict there has so far been muted.In court ahead of the ruling, Kanu insisted that proceedings could not continue because he had not yet filed his final written address, accusing the judge of bias and not understanding the law.The judgement was delivered after Kanu had been forcibly removed from the courtroom for unruly behaviour.Getty ImagesNnamdi Kanu has a global network of supporters - this group had gathered in London earlier this month to demand his freedomHe was first arrested in October 2015 but he jumped bail in 2017 and left the country after a military raid on his home. The court later revoked his bail in March 2019.Two years later, the government announced that he had been re-arrested. His lawyers say he was detained in Kenya and forcibly returned to Nigeria. Kenya has not commented.In 2022, an appeal court ordered that the charges against him be dropped, saying he had been illegally arrested abroad, but this ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court the following year.The calls for Biafran independence date back many years. In 1967 Igbo leaders declared a Biafran state, but after a brutal civil war, which led to the deaths of up to a million people, the secessionist rebellion was defeated.Many Igbo people continue to feel that they are marginalised by the Nigerian state however, it is not clear how many are in favour of independence.Additional reporting from BBC Igbo's Ebere Ekeopara in EnuguMore about Nigeria from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

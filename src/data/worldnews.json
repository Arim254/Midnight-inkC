Authorities believe she was taken against her will.The sheriff's department said in a social media post that \"law enforcement activity\" was ongoing \"related to the Guthrie case\" without providing further details.Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told local news station KOLD that investigators were \"actively working a lead\", the BBC's US news partner CBS reported.More than a dozen law enforcement vehicles, both marked and unmarked, were  seen in the area by BBC News, including Swat teams and forensics.Investigators have also found several gloves, with the closest discovered about two miles from Nancy Guthrie's home.The sheriff's department said reports that a glove was found inside her home or on the property were inaccurate. All collected evidence had been sent for laboratory analysis, they added.It said investigators had been able to establish identifying details about the suspect after analysing footage from a doorbell camera outside Guthrie's home.Getty ImagesUS news anchor Savannah Guthrie and her mother NancyThe suspect was wearing a 25-litre Ozark Trail Hiker Pack backpack in the footage, the FBI said.

    "body": "1 day agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorBloomberg via Getty ImagesPeter Magyar is ahead in the polls with less than two months to go before electionsLess than two months before Hungary's election, opposition leader Peter Magyar has accused his rivals of planning to blackmail him with a secretly recorded sex tape, and says he is filing a complaint with authorities.Magyar, who leads long-time Prime Minister Viktor Orban in the polls, said he suspected there were plans to release a tape of him from August 2024, when he says he engaged in consensual sex with a now ex-girlfriend at a party.He was responding to a photo recently posted online of a bedroom in an apartment dating back to then. Leading figures in Orban's Fidesz party said they knew nothing about the claims. The BBC has approached Orban's spokesman for comment.Magyar accused Fidesz of trying to blackmail him and made three allegations of unlawful conduct in a statement on Friday.Although no video has been published, he said one from that date would have been \"recorded with secret service equipment and possibly faked\".Magyar made no mention in his statement of the ex-girlfriend he had been with at the time of the alleged incident, although he said on Thursday he had accused her of extortion 15 months ago - an allegation she denied.She told Hungarian media that they were both victims regarding the alleged illicit video and she was ready to take legal action with him.Magyar accused Fidesz leaders of timing their campaign to coincide with the start of his nationwide campaign next week, and of trying to ruin the last week he was spending with his three sons ahead of the April election.Fidesz communications director Tamas Menczer accused Magyar of lying, while Orban's chief of staff Gergely Gulyas told reporters he could not comment on something he knew nothing about.Orban, Hungary's nationalist leader, has been in office for 16 years, but with parliamentary elections on 12 April, Magyar's centre-right Tisza party is at least eight points ahead in the latest opinion poll by Hungary's Idea Institute.Fidesz has so far focused its campaign on attacking the European Union, accusing Brussels of trying to bring down his government. He is seen as Vladimir Putin's closest ally in Europe and has called on the EU to stop sending money to Ukraine.On Friday, US President Donald Trump praised Orban as a \"truly strong and powerful leader\", ahead of a visit by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Trump said he had been \"proud to ENDORSE Viktor\" for re-election in 2022 and was \"honoured to do so again\".The election campaign is not even due to start until 21 February, but Magyar's allegations of dirty tricks are an indication of how murky the next few weeks may become.Magyar has built support across Hungary over the past two years, promising to reset relations with Hungary's European partners. A one-time Fidesz loyalist, he was once married to former justice minister Judit Varga, whose political career ended during a scandal in 2024. They divorced the year prior.",

    "body": "2 hours agoAleks PhillipsGetty ImagesThe event was due to take place over five days in late FebruaryAn annual cigar festival in Cuban capital Havana has become the latest casualty of a fuel shortage caused by a US oil blockade.The organising committee of the Festival del Habano announced on Saturday that this year's event - which was due to take place over five days in late February - would be postponed until further notice. It said the decision was motivated \"by the complex economic situation\" facing Cuba due to the \"economic, commercial and financial blockade\" by the US.A fuel shortage causing power cuts on the Caribbean island has been worsened by the US seizing oil shipments from Cuba's long-standing ally Venezuela.Cuba also has a shortage of aviation fuel, leading several airlines to suspend services there, while some countries, including the UK, have warned against non-essential travel to the island.Cuban cigars are regarded as among the finest in the world, but are illegal in the US due to long-standing American trade embargoes. More than 1,300 people from around 70 countries are estimated to attend the Habano Festival each year to sample cigars from Cuba's producers, as well as visit tobacco plantations and factories.With international tourism to the island nation limited by the US embargo, the festival's organisers said they hoped to wait until conditions had improved.The organising committee said it was working on setting a new date, which has yet to be announced.\"The priority of the Habano Festival is to offer its participants a comprehensive experience at the height of the relevance and prestige that this event represents internationally,\" it said.\"The postponement of this celebration is a measure aimed at protecting this experience.\"Venezuela was previously believed to have sent around 35,000 barrels of oil a day to Cuba before the US military seized former president Nicolás Maduro on 3 January.Power cuts lasting up to 18 hours a day have since affected hospital emergency wards, dialysis patients and pumping stations.US President Donald Trump has urged Cuban leaders to \"make a deal\" or face unspecified consequences.UN human rights experts have described Washington's restrictions on Cuba's oil imports as an \"extreme form of unilateral economic coercion\".The US and Cuba have had a strained relationship since the communist Fidel Castro overthrew a US-backed government in 1959. US economic and trade embargoes on Cuba have been in place since 1960.While steps were taken to improve diplomatic relations, particularly under former US President Barack Obama, the Trump administration has reversed many of these moves.",

    "body": "23 hours agoMadeline HalpertWatch: \"I will not back down\", says Don Lemon after pleading not guiltyFormer CNN host Don Lemon has pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from his coverage of a protest last month at a church over federal immigration raids in the US state of Minnesota.Lemon, 59, was charged with conspiracy to deprive rights and interfering with religious freedoms by allegedly obstructing someone's First Amendment rights by force.He was arrested after entering the Cities Church in St Paul on 18 January with protesters who said one of its pastors was an immigration enforcement official.He livestreamed the protest in an incident that resulted in charges for eight other people.Lemon did not speak as he entered the courtroom on Friday in St Paul, where two dozen protesters were gathered to support him, chanting \"[Attorney General] Pam Bondi has got to go\", according to the Associated Press. Four co-defendants who were there with Lemon also pleaded not guilty. Lemon has defended his decision to enter the church, saying he was simply carrying out his duty as an independent journalist covering a protest. \"I have spent my entire career covering the news. I will not stop now,\" he said soon after he was arrested. During Friday's hearing, one of Lemon's lawyers, Abbe Lowell, expressed concerns to the judge that investigators had taken Lemon's mobile phone when they arrested him in Los Angeles late last month, according to US media. Lemon and eight other co-defendants, including another journalist, have been charged with conspiracy against religious freedom at a place of worship and injuring, intimidating and interfering with the exercise of the right of religious freedom at a place of worship.In the 18 January incident, protesters interrupted a service the church by chanting \"ICE out\" and \"Justice for Renee Good\", the mother of three who was fatally shot by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer last month in Minneapolis. Lemon has said he was there as a journalist and not affiliated with the church protestors. Footage showed a chaotic scene unfolding inside the church, which belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention, as protesters and members of the congregation shout at each other.Federal agents killed a second protester, intensive care nurse Alex Pretti, in Minneapolis two weeks later. Both Pretti and Good were killed as they were protesting against the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts in Minnesota, an operation that has since ended. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in a social media post after Lemon's arrest that \"Trump will not tolerate the intimidation and harassment of Christians in their sacred places of worship\". A longstanding Trump critic, Lemon was fired from CNN in April 2023 after 17 years with the broadcaster. The morning show host had apologised for on-air comments that Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, then 51, was past her prime.ICE protester speaks out after White House shared fake arrest image",

    "body": "15 hours agoMadeline HalpertReutersTravel groups and airlines are warning of potential disruption as the US federal government partially shut down after lawmakers failed to reach a deal on funding the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) .Several groups, including Airlines for America, said in a joint statement on Friday that without a deal, the risk of unscheduled absences by Transportation Security Administration workers increased, causing flight delays and longer wait times.\"Travellers and the US economy cannot afford to have essential TSA personnel working without pay,\" they said.A partial government shutdown began at midnight (05:00 GMT) on Saturday after Congress failed to pass a bill to fund DHS operations.In exchange for a funding deal, Democrats had been pushing for more restrictions on US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which will not be significantly affected by the shutdown because of funding from the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" last year. Democrats have been demanding reforms after federal agents killed Alex Pretti and Renee Good, two Minneapolis residents who were protesting the Trump administration's immigration raids in Minnesota, in January.They have asked for a number of changes within the DHS including a ban on immigration agents wearing face masks, better identification for officers and stricter rules for obtaining warrants. On Thursday, Senate Democrats blocked two funding bills because the measures did not include the immigration reforms. The most recent funding measure passed at the end of January only funded the DHS for two weeks while lawmakers from both sides of the aisle attempted to reach a deal on immigration reforms. On Friday, US President Donald Trump said \"we'll see what happens\" when asked by reporters whether he anticipated cutting a deal with Democrats to fund the DHS.\"We always have to protect our law enforcement,\" Trump added.  The shutdown is expected to affect several agencies under the DHS umbrella, including the US Coast Guard and TSA. Last year, the US government saw its longest full shutdown in history, which lasted 43 days and led to many federal workers going without pay as well as flight chaos. Democrats at the time were pushing for more health care funding to address rising health care costs. Congress is set to take a recess until 23 February, meaning the shutdown could continue until Trump's State of the Union address the following day. However, lawmakers could be called back to Washington earlier if they seem on the brink of a deal. The partial shutdown is unlikely to cause as much travel chaos as last year's because the Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees air traffic controllers, has already been funded for the rest of the year. But TSA agents - who fall under the DHS - may have to go without pay if the shutdown drags on, meaning people could see longer lines at airports if workers call in sick. The US Coast Guard, which the DHS also oversees, could also be affected. Vice Admiral Thomas Allan told lawmakers that going a few days without funding would mean about 56,000 workers going without pay, leading the agency to suspend missions that were not critical or lifesaving. DHS has $165bn (£120bn) from Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act - which also included $75bn to fund ICE - that it could use to address some of the funding shortfalls. ",

    "body": "22 hours agoAleks PhillipsGetty ImagesProsecutors in Paris have opened investigations into five baby formula manufacturers after several issued mass recalls over concerns their product contained a toxin.Nestle, Lactalis, Danone, Babybio and La Marque en moins will be probed over whether there was any criminal wrongdoing in distributing baby formula that may have been contaminated with cereulide.French authorities have received complaints from eight individuals who reported their child vomited after consuming baby formula.Last week, Nestle and Danone issued recalls in more than 60 countries, including the UK, over potentially contaminated batches.At least 36 infants in the UK have suffered from suspected food poisoning after consuming baby formula, officials have said.Cereulide is a toxin which is unlikely to be destroyed through cooking or when making baby milk. If consumed, it can cause nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps.The toxin in baby formula was linked to an ingredient called arachidonic acid (ARA) oil, which gives it some of the same growth properties as breast milk.The UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) earlier said a third-party supplier of ARA was the source of the contamination and was no longer being used.That supplier is now widely thought to be a Chinese firm, which Agence France-Presse identified as Wuhan-based Cabio Biotech. The BBC has approached the company for comment.On Thursday, China's national market regulator told domestic baby formula manufacturers to test for cereulide, without mentioning specific companies.Prosecutors in Paris will seek to establish whether the baby formula producers are liable for distributing a tainted product.It will be co-ordinated with local probes into whether there was a causal link between the contaminated formula and the deaths of three babies in France. Nestle and France's health ministry have stressed there was as-yet no evidence to indicate such a link.So far 28 batches of baby formula produced by Nestle, which makes SMA, and Danone, which makes Aptamil and Cow & Gate, have been recalled.Danone and Nestle have given assurances to the FSA that recalled batches were produced some time ago and were unlikely still to be on UK shop shelves. However, they may be in cupboards at home, which is why parents and caregivers are being asked to check their supplies.Nestle said on Friday that it intended to run five factories around the clock to increase baby formula production after the global recall. Those factories are in France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands.\"We are focused on increasing the availability of infant formula to meet demand, providing parents and families with high quality products they can trust,\" the Swiss firm said.",

    "body": "20 hours agoMadeline HalpertandSakshi VenkatramanGetty ImagesJames Van Der Beek kept working after being diagnosed with cancerActor James Van Der Beek seemed to be everywhere in the 1990s and 2000s. With the title role in coming-of-age teen drama Dawson's Creek, he walked some of the industry's hottest red carpets, and his face plastered magazine covers - one even dubbing him a \"new superstar\".But when tragedy struck later in life, his family needed to rely on the kindness of his friends - and fans - for financial help, shedding light on the precarious situation of not just many actors, no matter how famous, but millions of everyday Americans struggling with medical bills.Van Der Beek - who had six children with his wife - died on Wednesday at the age of 48 after being diagnosed with colorectal cancer three years ago.The cost of his medical treatments were so financially draining, his wife says, that she has now made a public plea for donations so they would not lose their home. They have raised $2.3m (£1.7m) thus far.Getty ImagesJames Van Der Beek auctioned off the shirt he wore in this promotional stillIn the months before his death, Van Der Beek had shared how cash-strapped the cancer treatments had left him and his family. He even publicly auctioned off items he'd saved for decades from the roles that defined his career: a tartan buttoned shirt he wore in the first episode of Dawson's Creek, a necklace he gave to Katie Holmes' character on the teen drama series and sports shoes he wore when he starred in the 1999 film Varsity Blues.\"I've been storing these treasures for years, waiting for the right time to do something with them, and with all of the recent unexpected twists and turns life has presented recently, it's clear that the time is now,\" Van Der Beek told People magazine last November.On top of the costly treatments, Van Der Beek was not making the same cash that he'd seen in the prime of his career decades ago. He had said he was paid \"almost nothing\" for Dawson's Creek and his contract didn't include residuals - payments writers, actors and directors receive when their work is re-aired on television. Actors on other still-popular shows from that same period, like Friends, are said to make about $20m annually from such payments.\"There was no residual money,\" Van Der Beek told Today in 2012. \"I was 20. It was a bad contract. I saw almost nothing from that.\"He continued working after his diagnosis, appearing in two episodes of the television show Overcompensating in 2025, but it's unclear whether that was enough to qualify him for health insurance from the prominent actors' union in Hollywood. Actors can qualify for health insurance through Sag-Aftra only if they work 108 days a year or earn at least $28,090 on union shoots. The BBC has contacted the union.Van Der Beek is not the first high-profile US actor to highlight the issue. Beverly Hills 90210 star Shannen Doherty, who died in 2024, said she did not have insurance when she was first diagnosed with breast cancer.Getty ImagesVan Der Beek and his Dawson's Creek co-stars pictured in 1997Benjamin Byron Davis, 53, an actor who has appeared on television shows as well as in movies like Marvel's Ant-Man, told the BBC that decreased residuals had become a problem for actors across the board.\"Revenue streams that actors have depended upon have disappeared,\" he said, noting that the rise of streaming has affected how production companies compensate performers. He said many actors depend on these payments both for income and to qualify for health insurance through their union Sag-Aftra. \"I work when I'm hired and I survive when I'm not.\"Davis said he lost his health insurance during the 2023 Sag-Aftra strikes. \"There wasn't work,\" he said, adding that he ended up getting it back when the strikes were over and he was able to meet the qualifications again.Davis said that, just 10 years ago, the union's minimum earnings for health insurance was a third of what it is now, at a level today that is out of reach for the vast majority of actors.Those who are covered by the union plan get good health coverage, said Valerie Yaros, an archivist with Sag-Aftra.But it was possible Van Der Beek no longer received the union plan because of his fewer work hours, she added.In 2024, Van Der Beek told People that it had become a \"full-time job\" dealing with cancer treatment appointments and his insurance.A heated debate on health insuranceHis death put a new celebrity face on the debate about rising healthcare costs in the US - an issue that Republicans and Democrats have long recognised needs reform but have disagreed on the best ways to resolve the problem.The US has one of the most expensive health systems in the world, with spending on health care estimated to reach $5.9tn in 2026, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.About 100 million people in the US are estimated to struggle to pay off their medical and dental healthcare debt, according to recent data.The GoFundMe page posted online on Wednesday solicited donations to assist Van Der Beek's widow Kimberley and their six children, whose ages range from four to 15.His wife shared the page, which noted the \"significant financial strain\" the family had seen as they \"did everything possible to support James and provide for his care\".\"In the wake of this loss, Kimberly and the children are facing an uncertain future. The costs of James's medical care and the extended fight against cancer have left the family out of funds,\" the page reads. \"They are working hard to stay in their home and to ensure the children can continue their education and maintain some stability during this incredibly difficult time.\"Even with health insurance, cancer treatment can prove extremely costly for those in the US. Some studies suggest the average monthly cost of chemotherapy can range from $1,000 to $12,000.This is because in the US private healthcare system, even those with insurance can face high deductibles and thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs, said Eva Stahl, the vice-president of policy at Undue Medical Debt, a non-profit that has paid off about $25bn of medical debt for almost 15 million people.\"People simply can't afford vital, life-saving treatments without going into debt,\" she said. \"When even someone with James Van Der Beek's resources has no option but to fundraise for treatment, it's clear how fundamentally unfair our healthcare system is.\"Michael Short, a graphic artist in Tennessee who has had his own battles with medical debt, told the BBC that his sister has had to declare bankruptcy because of medical debt for treatments for her endometrial and another cancer, even with insurance coverage.\"It's in the hundreds of thousands if not millions for these cancer treatments,\" he said. \"The prices on these medications and on these treatments are just so high.\"More weekend picks",

    "body": "1 day agoMax MatzaGetty ImagesKathryn Ruemmler appears on a news programme in 2014Goldman Sachs' top lawyer, Kathryn Ruemmler, has announced she will step down from her role after months of pressure over her friendship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Emails disclosed by the US justice department show she referred to the disgraced financier in emails as \"Uncle Jeffrey\", advised him on how to push back against media and accepted luxury gifts from him.\"My responsibility is to put Goldman Sachs' interests first,\" Ruemmler, who previously served as White House counsel to former US President Barack Obama, said in a statement.Goldman CEO David Solomon thanked her for \"sound advice\". Her resignation will take effect from 30 June.\"Throughout her tenure, Kathy has been an extraordinary general counsel, and we are grateful for her contributions,\" Solomon said in a statement.\"Kathy has also been a mentor and friend to many of our people, and she will be missed. I accepted her resignation, and I respect her decision.\"There is no suggestion that appearing in the millions of documents related to Epstein that have been released in the US implies any criminal wrongdoing. But the drip of revelations became a public relations headache for the Wall Street bank, where Ruemmler led its reputational risk committee. She joined Goldman in 2020.Ruemmler said in a statement to news agency Reuters earlier this month: \"I got to know him [Epstein] as a lawyer and that was the foundation of my relationship with him.\"I had no knowledge of any ongoing criminal conduct on his part, and I did not know him as the monster he has been revealed to be.\"The BBC has contacted Ruemmler for comment.Emails show she had a large number of communications with Epstein between 2014 and 2019, when she was in private practice after leaving the White House.Epstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a child and died while in custody facing sex trafficking charges in 2019.In one December 2015 email exchange, Ruemmler wrote to a redacted recipient. \"I adore him [Epstein]. It's like having another older brother!\"That message came after Epstein offered to buy her a first-class ticket to Europe, according to the BBC's US news partner CBS.Her exit from Goldman follows the release of handwritten notes from a law enforcement official who participated in Epstein's sex trafficking arrest in July 2019.The notes suggest that, on the night he was taken into custody, Epstein called Ruemmler, whose mobile phone number is redacted in the documents.She has said she never represented Epstein as a legal client.Communications from March 2019, four months before Epstein's arrest, show Ruemmler advising him on how to push back against media scrutiny that his 2008 plea deal was too lenient.\"Far from [receiving] a sweetheart deal, Mr Epstein was subjected to a lengthy, aggressive, [and] highly unusual federal investigation for what were, in essence, local [offences] of sexual solicitation,\" Ruemmler wrote.She suggests arguing that Epstein was being persecuted due to his \"wealth\".The emails also show that Epstein lavished Ruemmler with gifts, including flowers, wine, a Hermès bag, $10,000 (£7,300) in Bergdorf Goodman gift cards and an Apple watch.\"Am totally tricked out by Uncle Jeffrey today! Jeffrey boots, handbag, and watch!\" Ruemmler wrote in a 2019 message.Last month, a Goldman spokesman played down the gifts, saying: \"It's well known that Epstein often offered unsolicited favours and gifts to his many business contacts.\"Ruemmler's departure is the latest corporate resignation linked to the latest Epstein disclosures.Last week, Brad Karp, the chairman of prestigious US law firm Paul Weiss, stepped down after emails revealed he discussed Epstein's 2008 conviction with him.",

    "body": "17 hours agoHarry SekulichGetty ImagesA fire at an oil refinery in Cuba has been brought under control quickly, as the country faces a deepening fuel crisis.Black smoke clouds could be seen billowing from the Ñico López Refinery in the capital, Havana, on Friday. No-one was injured and an investigation into the blaze has been established, Cuba's energy ministry said in a post on X. The fire occurred close to where two oil tankers had been moored in Havana Bay.A fuel shortage in Cuba has been worsened by the US blocking oil shipments from Venezuela, a long-standing ally in the region, to the island.Venezuela was previously believed to have sent it around 35,000 barrels of oil a day before the US military captured former president Nicolás Maduro in a raid on the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, on 3 January.The US also confiscated Venezuelan oil tankers, cutting off key supplies of fuel to Cuba, and pledged new tariffs on countries that sell oil to Cuba.US President Donald Trump has urged Cuban leaders to \"make a deal\" or face unspecified consequences, after flows of oil and money from Venezuela were cut off.Electricity cuts have impacted hospital emergency wards, dialysis patients and pumping stations amid the latest supply shortfalls.Cuba also has a shortage of aviation fuel, leading several airlines to suspend services to the Caribbean island nation, while some countries, including the UK, have warned against non-essential travel there.\"Authorities have introduced fuel rationing, scaled back public services, and made temporary changes to healthcare, education, transport and tourism operations to conserve severely limited energy supplies,\" the UK Foreign Office warned recently.As the oil embargo continues to make life and access to essentials difficult in Cuba, two Mexican ships carrying 800 tonnes of humanitarian aid arrived in Havana Bay on Thursday.United Nations human rights experts have described Washington's restrictions on Cuba's oil imports as an \"extreme form of unilateral economic coercion\".UN human rights chief Volker Türk said he was \"extremely concerned\" about the worsening crisis in Cuba.The US and Cuba have had a strained relationship since the communist Fidel Castro overthrew a US-backed government in 1959. US economic and trade embargoes on Cuba have been in place since 1960.While steps were taken to improve diplomatic relations, particularly under former US President Barack Obama, the Trump administration has reversed many of these moves.",

    "body": "7 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykReutersProminent US agent Casey Wasserman is selling his talent company after documents linking him to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell were published in the US.Several high-profile clients, including singer Chappell Roan, quit the firm this week after it emerged he flew on Epstein's private plane and exchanged flirtatious emails with Maxwell in 2003.Wasserman said in an company-wide email sent on Friday that he had \"become a distraction\" as he announced he has begun the process to sell the major LA-based agency.The 51-year-old, who has also resisted calls to stand down from his role as chair of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, previously said he had no \"personal or business relationship\" with Epstein.\"I'm deeply sorry that my past personal mistakes have caused you so much discomfort,\" Wasserman wrote to the agency's 4,000 employees in the email, which was obtained by the BBC.He continued: \"It's not fair to you, and it's not fair to the clients and partners we represent so vigorously and care so deeply about.\"Wasserman said he \"deeply regrets\" his discussions with Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for facilitating the sexual abuse of teenage girls by Epstein. He said his email exchanges with Maxwell \"took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light\".Wasserman has not been accused of wrongdoing by any of Epstein's victims and the appearance of his name in the files does not imply criminal activity of any kind.Earlier this week, LA28 said Wasserman would remain chairman of the 2028 games after organisers reviewed his past interactions with Maxwell. They found his relationship did not go further than the exchanges that had already been documented and that he had fully co-operated with an investigation. The LA28 board said in a statement that Wasserman and his then-wife flew on a humanitarian mission to Africa on Epstein's plane at the invitation of the Clinton Foundation in 2003.The board said the journey was long before \"Wasserman or the public knew of Epstein and Maxwell's deplorable crimes\". \"This was his single interaction with Epstein. Shortly after, he traded the publicly-known emails with Maxwell,\" the statement continued.A number of stars have have walked away from Wasserman's agency in recent days.She said: \"No artist, agent or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values.\"Roan did not specifically mention the Epstein-related documents in her statement. Other musical artists have announced their plans to exit Wasserman's agency, including country music singer-songwriter Orville Peck, North Carolina-based rock band Wednesday, and singer-songwriter Weyes Blood. Former US football player Abby Wambach also said she was leaving the agency, saying: \"I know what I know and I am following my gut and values. I will not participate in any business arrangement under his leadership.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoNatasha BootyAFP via Getty ImagesThe $1.6m (£1.2m) trial was funded by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (stock image)A now-halted plan to run a hepatitis B vaccine trial involving thousands of newborns in Guinea-Bissau has been criticised by the World Health Organization as \"unethical\".The US-funded study had sought to give one set of babies the vaccine at birth, while another would have had the shot delayed until six weeks of age. The WHO said it had \"significant concerns\" about the plan, and described the birth-dose vaccine as \"an effective and essential public health intervention, with a proven record\".The US health department, headed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has questioned the effects of vaccines, had sought to use the trial to answer questions about the jab's broader health effects.The WHO said on Friday that its concerns regarded the study's scientific justification, ethical safeguards and consistency with established standards for research involving humans.It stressed that the jab had been used for more than three decades in more than 115 countries.The WHO said giving a proven life-saving intervention to some newborns but not others exposed them to \"potentially irreversible harm\".A sizeable portion of Guinea-Bissau's population is estimated to have hepatitis B, and the WHO says vaccination at birth prevents the virus being transmitted from mother to baby in 70-95% of cases.It argued that trials giving one group a placebo or not treating them were only acceptable when no proven treatment existed, something that was not the case with the hepatitis B birth dose vaccine.The WHO recommends that all newborns receive the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth. It says infection at birth is the most common way of having a lifelong infection, with 90% of infected newborns becoming chronic carriers.In Guinea-Bissau, the dose is currently given at six weeks, though authorities plan to introduce the birth dose nationwide by 2028 to align with global standards, something the WHO said it would help accelerate.A total of 14,000 babies in the West African country were due to be involved in the study funded by the US and led by Danish researchers.But public outrage at the project prompted the Guinea-Bissau government to suspend it last month. 'We are not guinea pigs'Critics have questioned why babies in the African country were being proposed for the trial.Two months ago, a panel of top advisers voted to stop recommending that all newborns in the US receive a hepatitis B vaccine.Kennedy has on several occasions denied being against vaccinations and has said he and his children had been vaccinated, but has also repeatedly stated widely debunked claims about vaccine harms.Vocal opponents of the project in Guinea-Bissau include the country's former health minister, Magda Robalo.Most people with the virus do not have any symptoms, or have very mild symptoms.But some people can experience jaundice, dark urine, feeling very tired, nausea, vomiting and pain in the abdomen.The WHO says chronic patients have a high risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "22 hours agoAFP via Getty ImagesMinneapolis residents and students protesting against ICETwo immigration agents may have made \"untruthful statements\" in sworn testimony about the shooting of a migrant in Minneapolis last month, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has said.ICE acting director Todd Lyons said the two officers, who have not been named,  were immediately placed on administrative leave pending an internal investigation.\"Lying under oath is a serious federal offence,\" Lyons said. On Friday, a judge granted a request to drop charges against two men who were accused of attacking the officers.The Department of Homeland Security initially said a federal officer shot a man in the leg after being attacked with a shovel and broom handle by three migrants on 14 January.Lyons said in a statement on Friday that the two officers appeared to have provided inaccurate testimony and that the US attorney's office was actively investigating the matter.\"Video evidence has revealed that sworn testimony provided by two separate officers appears to have made untruthful statements,\" he said.\"Upon conclusion of the investigation, the officers may face termination of employment, as well as potential criminal prosecution.\"After the 14 January incident, the DHS issued a statement saying the shooting happened after a car chase involving a Venezuelan national who was in the country illegally. After the pursuit, the man got out of his car and an altercation broke out between him and the federal agent, it added.\"While the subject and law enforcement were in a struggle on the ground, two subjects came out of a nearby apartment and also attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle,\" the agency had claimed.\"As the officer was being ambushed and attacked by the two individuals, the original subject got loose and began striking the officer with a shovel or broom stick.\"The DHS statement went on to say: \"Fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired defensive shots.\" The three people then ran into an apartment and were later all arrested, the DHS said. Watch: Protesters clash with authorities in Minneapolis after ICE shoot man in legShortly after the incident, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said an agent was \"beat up, he's bruised, he is injured, he's getting treatment, and we're thankful that he made it out alive\".It was soon followed by a statement on X from US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who said: \"Minnesota insurrection is a direct result of a FAILED governor and a TERRIBLE mayor encouraging violence against law enforcement. It's disgusting.\"Two men, Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna and Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, were charged with forcibly assaulting, resisting or impeding federal officers in the performance of their official duties.From the outset, the official account of the incident was inconsistent. DHS said it was Sosa-Celis who was driving the car then fled on foot but an FBI affidavit said it was Aljorna, the BBC's US partner CBS News reports.The DHS also scaled back an earlier claim that three people had attacked the immigration agent, as charging documents later stated there were only two individuals involved.Sosa-Celis was shot in the leg during the incident. On Thursday, in an extraordinary reversal, Minnesota's top federal prosecutor Daniel N Rosen asked a judge to dismiss the charges against Aljorna and Sosa-Celis, saying that \"newly discovered evidence in this matter is materially inconsistent with the allegations\".US border tsar: Minneapolis immigration enforcement surge endingThe US attorney wrote that, as a result, dismissing the case with prejudice - meaning it cannot be refiled - \"will serve the interests of justice\".A judge granted the request on Friday and dismissed the case.Frederick Goetz, a lawyer representing Aljorna, said he was \"delighted\" by the decision to dismiss the charges with prejudice.\"It is my understanding that the video surveillance evidence that captured the incident was materially inconsistent with the federal agent's claims of what happened,\" Goetz said in a statement to CBS News, adding that \"the agent's claims of being assaulted were not backed up by the video evidence\".Sosa-Celis' lawyer Robin Wolpert said his client was \"a crime victim\".\"These untruthful statements had serious consequences for my client and his family,\" he said. A third Venezuelan man, Gabriel Alejandro Hernandez Ledezma, who lived nearby, was also arrested after the 14 January incident, but a court filing shows he was taken to an ICE detention facility in Texas, and was later returned to Minnesota and released by order of a federal judge.More than 4,000 undocumented immigrants were arrested during the campaign, he said.",

    "body": "3 hours agoAdam GoldsmithandTom McArthurGetty ImagesRussian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed using a poison developed from a dart frog toxin, the UK and European allies have said.Two years on from the death of Navalny at a Siberian penal colony, Britain and its allies have blamed the Kremlin following analysis of material samples found on his body.Speaking from the Munich Security Conference, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said \"only the Russian government had the means, motive and opportunity\" to use the poison while Navalny was imprisoned in Russia.According to Tass news agency Moscow has dismissed the finding as \"an information campaign\", but Cooper said there is no explanation for the toxin, called epibatidine, being found.While Cooper announced the findings, a joint statement was issued by the UK, Sweden, France, Germany and the Netherlands.Cooper met with Navalny's widow Yulia Navalnaya at the conference this weekend.\"Russia saw Navalny as a threat,\" Cooper said at the event.\"By using this form of poison the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition,\" she added.In the statement the allies said: \"Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny during his imprisonment in a Russian penal colony in Siberia, and we hold it responsible for his death.\"Epibatidine can be found naturally in dart frogs in the wild in South America. Dart frogs in captivity do not produce this toxin and it is not found naturally in Russia.\"There is no innocent explanation for its presence in Navalny's body.\"The Foreign Office said the UK has informed the Organisation on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons of Russia's alleged breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Praising Navalny's \"huge courage\", UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said \"his determination to expose the truth has left an enduring legacy\".\"I am doing whatever it takes to defend our people, our values and our way of life from the threat of Russia and Putin's murderous intent,\" he added.French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot also said his country \"pays tribute\" to Navalny, who he suggested was \"killed for his fight in favour of a free and democratic Russia\".Navalny – an anti-corruption campaigner and Russia's most vociferous opposition leader - died suddenly in jail on 16 February 2024 at the age of 47.In 2020 he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. He underwent treatment in Germany, and was arrested at the airport upon his return to Russia.Watch: 'Only Russian state had means' to poison Navalny, says Yvette CooperBefore Saturday's announcement, Navalny's wife Yulia Navalnaya had consistently argued that her husband was killed by poisoning while serving a prison sentence in an Arctic penal colony in 2024.She did not provide details on the poison allegedly used, on the samples or on the analysis – but challenged the two laboratories to publish their results.Reacting to the announcement, Navalnaya said: \"I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof.\"I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth,\" she added.German Federal Foreign Office via Getty ImagesNavalny's wife Yulia Navalnaya had consistently claimed that her husband was poisoned by RussiaAccording to the state-run news agency Tass, Kremlin spokesperson Maria Zakharova said: \"All the talks and statements are an information campaign aimed at distracting attention from the West's pressing problems.\"Russian President Vladimir Putin, who studiously avoided naming Navalny while he was alive, briefly referred to him a month after his death by stating that a person passing was \"always a sad event\".At the time of his death, Navalny had been in jail for three years on trumped-up charges and had recently been transferred to the penal colony.According to Russian accounts, the 47-year-old took a short walk at his Siberian penal colony, said he felt unwell, then collapsed and never regained consciousness.Speaking to BBC Russian, toxicology expert Jill Johnson said epibatidine was \"200 times more potent than morphine\". By acting on receptors in the central nervous system, it can cause \"muscle twitching and paralysis, seizures, slow heart rate, respiratory failure and finally death,\" she said.The extremely rare neurotoxin is only found in one wild frog species in tiny quantities, and only when the frog eats a specific diet, Johnson said, describing it as an \"incredibly rare way to poison a person\".She said: \"Finding the wild frog in the correct location that is eating the specific diet to create the correct alkaloids is almost impossible...almost.\"",

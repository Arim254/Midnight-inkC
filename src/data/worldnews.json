    "body": "13 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent, BeirutIsrael's military has killed a senior member of the militant group Hezbollah in an air strike on the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital, Beirut, despite a ceasefire.It described Haitham Ali al-Tabtabai, Hezbollah's chief of staff, as a veteran of the group who had held a series of senior positions.Lebanon's health ministry said at least five people were killed and 28 others wounded in the strike, which hit an apartment building in the densely populated Dahieh district.Hezbollah confirmed Tabtabai's death, adding Israel had crossed a \"red line\" in carrying out the strike.The strike is Israel's first on southern Beirut for months.It comes as Israel has escalated its campaign on people and targets it says are linked to Hezbollah - a Shia Muslim group supported by Iran - despite a ceasefire brokered by the US and France that came into effect last November.Israeli officials say Hezbollah has been trying to rebuild its military capabilities, is smuggling weapons into Lebanon and stepping up the production of explosive drones as an alternative to rockets and missiles, and there are growing fears of an escalation of hostilities.In a statement after the strike, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: \"Under my leadership, the State of Israel will not allow Hezbollah to rebuild its power, and we will not allow it to once again pose a threat to the State of Israel.\"He said he expected the Lebanese government \"to fulfill its commitment to disarm Hezbollah\".Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun has urged the international community to put pressure on Israel - which continues to occupy at least five locations in southern Lebanon - to stop the attacks and withdraw from the country, saying the Israeli actions are a violation of the agreement that put an end to 13 months of conflict.The Lebanese government has vowed to disarm Hezbollah, but the group has rejected calls to discuss the future of its weapons before Israel stops its attacks, fully withdraws from Lebanon, and releases Lebanese prisoners. A Western diplomatic official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the BBC the authorities are under pressure from the Trump administration, which is growing impatient with what they see as the slow progress against the group, considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the US and UK.The latest conflict between Israel and Hezbollah erupted after the Lebanese group started firing rockets at Israeli positions the day after the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023. Hezbollah said it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.Lebanese authorities said Israel's attacks killed about 4,000 people there - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israeli authorities said more than 80 of its soldiers and 47 of its civilians were killed in the hostilities.The US government imposed sanctions on Tabtabai in 2016 and designated him a terrorist. It has a $5m (£3.8m) award on offer for information about him.The US described him as a key Hezbollah military leader who once commanded the group's special forces in Syria and Yemen, adding his actions in these countries were part of a larger Hezbollah effort to provide training, material, and personnel \"in support of its destabilising regional activities\".",

Officials estimate there has been hundreds of millions of pounds worth of damage.The mountainous province of Dak Lak has been severely impacted, recording more than 60 deaths since 16 November, according to news agency AFP.The floods are the latest extreme weather event to hit Vietnam in recent months, after typhoons Kalmaegi and Bualoi hit the country within weeks of each other.Some 258,000 people were without power on Sunday morning and sections of major motorways and train tracks were blocked, officials said.Military and police resources have been mobilised to assist in the hardest hit areas.The government said the most severe impacts had been observed in five provinces - Quang Ngai, Gia Lai, Dak Lak, Khanh Hoa, and Lam Dong - clustered in south and south-central Vietnam.Mach Van Si, a farmer in Dak Lak, told AFP: \"Our neighbourhood was completely destroyed. Nothing was left. Everything was covered in mud.\"Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính chaired a virtual emergency meeting on Sunday morning from South Africa, where he had been attending the G20 summit. Rainfall had exceeded 1.5m (5ft) in several areas leading up to Friday, with some areas surpassing a 5.2m level not seen since 1993. The rain is forecast to ease in the coming days.Scientists say that Vietnam has been left more exposed to extreme weather events by human-driven climate change, which has made typhoons stronger and more frequent.",

The area has been cordoned off and rescue teams are currently on site. One official said five security officials and seven civilians were injured.Pakistan authorities have described the attack as a \"foiled terrorist plot\", noting that the attackers were gunned down at the gate, before they managed to enter the building.\"The perpetrators of this incident should be identified as soon as possible and brought to justice,\" said Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Pakistan's Federal Constabulary, previously known as the Frontier Constabulary, is responsible for handling situations beyond the capabilities of the police force, including tribal incursions and criminal gang violence.Peshawar is part of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which sits along the border Afghanistan and has long been a flashpoint for militant violence.The Pakistani Taliban, also known as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, is active in the province and had claimed responsibility for similar attacks across the country.Additional reporting by Kelly Ng",

The thieves pretended to be officers of the Reserve Bank of India. They stopped the transport vehicle saying they had to check the paperwork for such a large amount of money.The vehicle's cash custodian and two security guards were instructed to get into an SUV, while one of the gang members took control of the van, police said.Police said the gang had changed vehicles, used fake registration plates and selected locations with minimal CCTV coverage to transfer the boxes of cash.A massive hunt was launched on Wednesday, with more than 200 police officers deployed across Karnataka state and the neighbouring Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Goa states.Detectives are investigating the role of CMS and possible violations of guidelines for transferring cash, Singh said.\"The vans should not follow the same route and timing repeatedly so as to become predictable,'' he added.",

    "body": "8 hours agoJane ChambersBusiness reporter, Aguas Calientes, PeruAFP via Getty ImagesMachu Picchu attracts more than 1.6 million tourists per year, but getting there is not easyMachu Picchu, the remains of a 15th Century Inca city, is Peru's most popular tourist destination, and a Unesco world heritage site. Yet a continuing dispute over the buses that take visitors up to the mountain-top site recently saw some 1,400 stranded tourists needing to be evacuated.Cristian Alberto Caballero Chacón is head of operations for bus company Consettur, which for the past 30 years has transported some 4,500 people every day to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas Calientes.It is a 20-minute journey, and the only alternative is an arduous, steep, two-hour walk.He admits that in the past few months \"there have been some conflicts between people from different communities here\".This conflict revolves around Consettur losing its licence to a rival bus firm in this remote part of Peru, where, unless you want to hike over Andes mountains, the only access is by public transport.To get to Machu Picchu without walking, tourists must first take a train to Aguas Calientes, which takes from two to three and a half hours. And then transfer to a bus for the final leg.Wilson ChiloA fleet of buses ferry tourists to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas CalientesBack in September, local protestors angry that Consettur was being replaced following what they saw as an insufficiently open bidding process, blocked the railway line to Aguas Calientes with rocks.This resulted in Peruvian authorities having to clear the tracks and evacuate tourists on special train services.A number of local people, who didn't want to go on the record, say the protestors were unhappy that Consettur had a monopoly on the lucrative bus service, and that its position as sole provider was simply due to be transferred to new company San Antonio de Torontoy. A round-trip bus ticket costs $24 (£18) for a foreigner and $15 for a Peruvian.Although Consettur's licence ran out in September, it is continuing to run its buses. And due to legal challenges, San Antonio de Torontoy has yet to start.It's a complex situation, involving people from different local communities wanting a slice of the bus income, but Mr Caballero is adamant that Consettur is not a monopoly.\"The owners of the business have been running the company for the past 30 years, and they are people who come from around here,\" he says. \"This is not a monopoly. Consettur is made up of 12 different companies with various partners.\"These partners include the local district council, which owns 38% of Consettur.Meanwhile, San Antonio de Torontoy is based slightly further away in the wider Urubamba Province.AFP via Getty ImagesUnless you fancy a long hike, the only way to get to the town of Aguas Calientes is by trainAs the row and legal dispute over the buses rumbles on, Australian tourist Annalise Jaksic complains about the cost of the trains to Aguas Calientes. The cheapest round-trip ticket is $140, rising to $2,000 for luxury first class.Speaking in Aguas Calientes, she says: \"We thought it was one train [all the way to Machu Picchu]. And we thought if there was any more transport to get up there it would all be included, because you pay so much money for the train.\"Her friend and travelling companion Todd Carland adds that buying the entry tickets for the site \"was a nightmare for us\". He says it was difficult to arrange because they weren't doing it through an expensive guided tour. A standard adult price for Machu Picchu is $57.The mayor of Aguas Calientes, Elvis La Torre, is also unhappy about the tickets, because he says that most of the revenues do not stay locally.\"Only 10% of the ticket sales stay in the region. The rest of the money goes to the Ministry of Culture to look after other archaeological sites around Peru and pay for wages.\"He wants more money to go to his community and the surrounding region to help improve tourism and fund more projects to help the locals. The Ministry of Culture was asked for a comment.Wilson ChiloCristian Alberto Caballero Chacón says Consettur would welcome the competitionOutside on one of the side streets that are full of stalls offering tourism souvenirs, like fluffy alpacas and scarves, Dina Huillca is sitting on the pavement selling roses, tomatoes and mint. She travels from her village to get here, and says that \"more needs to be done for the local communities\".She adds: \"We don't have basic services like running water, or a hospital, and the schools need to be in better condition.\"Carlos González is president of the chamber of tourism for this region of Peru, the Department of Cusco. He has an ambitious desire to see the state control of all public transport in Peru.\"We are pushing for an update in the law so that the vice ministry of tourism can take care of all the travel resources in our country,\" he says. \"If we don't have a unified approach to Peru as a destination we can't be competitive in the long term.\"He also wants to change tourists' experiences in Machu Picchu, with more entrances, and separate areas where different types of visitors can gather.\"[Such as] spiritual travellers going and having meditative rituals in one area,\" says Mr Gonzalez. \"And let's not forget the younger crowd who are more inclined to do their Tik Toks and their stories for Instagram. They also need a place for doing that and enjoying themselves in a young fashion.\"But he says that Peru's unstable national governments make change difficult. The country has had six different presidents in the past six years.\"I've been a leader of the tourism sector for five years now, and I have lost count of how many ministers, vice ministers and congress people I have spoken to.\"Back in Aguas Calientes, Mr Caballero says he'd be happy to see both Consettur and San Antonio de Toronto run buses to and from Machu Picchu.\"If they are given the final approval we don't have a problem with working with them. We won't stop them.\"Read more global business and tech stories",

    "body": "A Ukrainian refugee has become the first person from his country to win an elite-level sumo tournament.Danylo Yavhusishyn - known by his sumo ring name Aonishiki - arrived in Japan as an 18-year-old in 2022 after the Russian invasion of his country.Now aged 21, he is the first Ukrainian to claim the prized Emperor's Cup and the first European in almost eight years to do so.He is now on the verge of being promoted to the second-highest rank of Ozeki, in what would be the fastest promotion in history.Aonishiki finished the 15-day tournament in Fukuoka, Japan, with a record of 12 wins and three losses and went on to win the championship play-off against Yokozuna grand champion Hoshoryu, a 26-year-old Mongolian who won last month's London tournament.In his winning ceremony interview, Aonishiki was asked if he felt satisfied with his results after three years in sumo.\"No, I think this is just the beginning,\" he replied.The name Aonishiki contains the Japanese character for \"blue\" - a reference to the Ukrainian flag.Aonishiki is only the second Ukrainian in the top division in sumo. He first tried sumo aged seven, after also practicing judo and freestyle wrestling.He impressed in youth amateur sumo competitions, and fled to Germany with his family after Russia's invasion.He moved to Japan by himself in April 2022, without knowing the language, with the help of a university sumo club captain he met previously at a youth championship event.Despite only being in professional sumo for a short time, he has gained fans in Japan and worldwide with his impressive skills, constant improvement and competitiveness.He often defeats opponents with seldom-used techniques, receiving praise from both professionals and sumo enthusiasts.Aonishiki, who was one of the most cheered wrestlers at last month's Grand Sumo Tournament at the Royal Albert Hall in London, is tipped by many to become the first-ever European to reach sumo's highest rank of Yokozuna grand champion.",

    "body": "3 hours agoRichard Kagoe,Nairobi, Kenya and Wedaeli ChibelushiFifty of the 315 children kidnapped by gunmen from a Catholic school in Nigeria's Niger State on Friday have escaped. The Christian Association of Nigeria says they have been reunited with their families. A major military-led search and rescue operation is under way for the remaining 265 children and 12 teachers who were taken with them.Authorities in several Nigerian states ordered schools to shut following the mass abduction in Niger and another smaller hostage-taking in Kebbi state on Monday when 20 pupils were kidnapped from a boarding school.  In response to a spate of abductions, Nigerian President Bola Tinubu ordered the recruitment of an additional 30,000 police officers.In another development, 38 people abducted from a church service in Kwara state last week were freed on Sunday, the state governor said.Two people were killed in the attack on Christ Apostolic Church in Eruku.Orders were given for many schools to close in the states of Kebbi, Niger, Katsina, Yobe and Kwara.News of the children's escape brought welcome relief for families and for a country that has been agonising over the fate of hundreds of schoolchildren abducted in Nigeria's northwest. Tinubu also directed the redeployment of all police in Very Important Persons (VIP) protection services to focus on core duties, especially in remote areas prone to attacks.VIPs in need of safeguarding will now be able to request armed personnel from the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC).According to a Christian group involved in the case, the pupils managed to escape between Friday and Saturday in what is being described as a brave and risky attempt to flee their captors.The students and teachers were taken from St Mary's School in Papiri, Niger state. Earlier reports spoke of 303 students and 12 teachers being taken. Their number surpasses the 276 abducted during the infamous Chibok mass abduction of 2014.Local police say armed men stormed St Mary's at around 02:00 (01:00 GMT), abducting students staying there.Niger state governor Mohammed Umaru Bongo announced on Saturday that all schools in the area would close, warning that was \"not a time for blame game\".Calling for the release of the abductees, Pope Leo XIV expressed \"immense sadness\" and urged the authorities to act swiftly.Dominic Adamu, whose daughters attend the school but were not taken, told the BBC: \"Everybody is weak... It took everybody by surprise.\"One distressed woman tearfully told the BBC that her nieces, aged six and 13, had been kidnapped, adding: \"I just want them to come home.\"The military, police and local vigilantes are conducting a search for the children, combing nearby forests and remote routes believed to have been used by the gunmen.Authorities in Niger state said St Mary's School had disregarded an order to close all boarding facilities following intelligence warnings of a heightened risk of attacks. The school has not commented on that allegation.The kidnapping of people for ransom by criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, has become a major problem in many parts of Nigeria.The payment of ransoms has been outlawed in an attempt to cut the supply of money to the criminal gangs, but it has had little effect.On Monday, more than 20 schoolgirls, who the BBC has been told are Muslim, were kidnapped from a boarding school in Kebbi state.Authorities there have now ordered all secondary schools and colleges to close.The Nigerian president has postponed foreign trips - including to this weekend's G20 summit in South Africa - in order to address the security concerns.This week's attacks follows claims by right-wing figures in the US, including President Donald Trump, that Christians are being persecuted in Nigeria.For months, campaigners and politicians in Washington have been alleging that Islamist militants are systematically targeting Christians. The Nigerian government has dismissed this claim.Earlier this month, Trump said he would send troops into Nigeria \"guns a-blazing\" if the African nation's government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".The Nigerian government has called claims that Christians are being persecuted \"a gross misrepresentation of reality\".An official said that \"terrorists attack all who reject their murderous ideology - Muslims, Christians and those of no faith alike\".In the north-east, jihadist groups have been battling the state for more than a decade.Organisations monitoring violence say most of the victims of these groups are Muslim because most attacks happen in the majority-Muslim north of the country.In the centre of Nigeria, there are also frequently deadly attacks between herders - who are mostly Muslim - on farmers, who are largely Christian.However, analysts say these are often motivated by competition for resources, such as water or land, rather than religion.The militant Islamist group Boko Haram took 276 girls from their school in the town of Chibok in 2014.The incident drew international attention and sparked a global campaign seeking their return, which included an intervention from then-US First Lady Michelle Obama.Many have since either escaped or been freed, but as many as 100 remain missing.",

    "body": "1 day agoRushdi Abualouf,Gaza correspondent, Istanbul and Jon Donnison,correspondent, JerusalemAt least 22 Palestinians have been killed in a series of Israeli air strikes across northern and central Gaza, Hamas medical and civil defence officials have said.They said five sites had been hit, including residential homes. A senior Hamas commander was among the dead, according to local sources.The Israeli military said it had struck targets in Gaza in response to an incident earlier on Saturday, when it said an \"armed terrorist\" had fired at soldiers after crossing the Strip's so-called \"yellow line\" designating areas under full Israeli control. Hamas denied this.Both sides have accused each other of violating the ceasefire deal agreed on six weeks ago.More than 310 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since the ceasefire came into force, according to Gaza's health ministry.The territory's civil defence said Saturday's strikes by Israel targeted Gaza City in the north, as well as Deir al-Balah and Nuseirat camp in central Gaza.The Hamas officials said five people had been killed at the Abbas junction in the densely populated Rimal area of Gaza City. Witnesses said an Israeli strike set a car on fire.In addition, three people were killed near a mosque in Deir al-Balah, the officials said.Two houses were targeted in Israeli strikes in Nuseirat, they added, with three killed after the home of the Abu Amouneh family was hit. Seven others were killed in another strike targeting the house of the Abu Shawish family.Three more people were killed later on Saturday when a house in western Gaza City was hit, officials reported.The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a later statement: \"Today, Hamas violated the ceasefire again, sending a terrorist into Israel held territory to attack IDF soldiers. In response, Israel eliminated five senior Hamas terrorists.\"The statement also called on mediators to \"insist that Hamas fulfil its side of the ceasefire\".Following the strikes, Hamas said the army's westward push of the yellow line and continued bombardment of eastern Gaza amounted to a \"blatant breach\" of the agreement.The group called on mediators and the US to intervene urgently, warning that Israel was attempting to impose \"new facts on the ground\" and undermine the ceasefire.The Israeli military launched an offensive in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 69,500 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, including 280 during the ceasefire, according to the territory's health ministry.",

    "body": "US and Ukrainian negotiators have drawn up an \"updated and refined peace framework\", and plan to continue \"intensive\" work on a peace plan over the coming days, the countries announced on Sunday.  A joint statement said talks on a US-backed plan in Geneva had been \"highly productive\".US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said there had been a \"tremendous amount of progress\" on honing a US-backed plan, but there was \"still some work to be done\" before any final agreement could be put to Russia.The plan's original draft, the details of which were leaked last week, was cautiously welcomed by Russia, but not by leaders in Kyiv and Europe, who saw it as too favourable to the Kremlin.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said there were \"signals that President [Donald] Trump's team is hearing us\".Speaking to reporters late on Sunday, Rubio said the negotiating teams in Geneva had had a \"very good day\".He said the main goal had been to try to narrow \"open items\" from the 28-point US plan, and that the parties involved had achieved that in a \"substantial way\".However, America's top diplomat said any final agreement would have to be agreed by the Ukrainian and US presidents before it could be put to Russia, and that there were still some issues being negotiated.Positive accounts of the meeting came hours after Trump accused Ukraine's leaders of showing \"zero gratitude\" for US efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war.The US president also pointed out that Europe - where Kyiv has some of its most loyal allies - was continuing to buy oil from Russia. Moscow relies heavily on its oil and gas exports to continue financing its war in Ukraine.Several media outlets, including Reuters news agency, reported the text of an alternative plan to end the war drafted by Kyiv's European allies, lead by the UK, France and Germany. The BBC has not independently verified its contents and Rubio denied any knowledge of its existence.While the draft of the US-backed plan has not been published in full, major details have leaked in recent days.Controversial provisions include Ukraine agreeing to withdraw troops from parts of the eastern Donetsk region that they currently control, and international recognition of de facto Russian control of Donetsk, the neighbouring Luhansk region and the southern Crimea peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in 2014.The plan also includes freezing the borders of Ukraine's southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions along the current battle lines, and would see Ukraine agreeing to limit the size of its military to 600,000 personnel, down from about 880,000 now.The draft crucially includes a pledge for Ukraine not to seek membership of Nato. Instead, Kyiv would receive \"reliable security guarantees\", about which no details have been given. The document says \"it is expected\" that Russia will not invade its neighbours and that Nato will not expand further.The draft also suggests Russia will be \"reintegrated into the global economy\", through the lifting of sanctions and by inviting Russia to rejoin the G7 group of the world's most powerful countries - making it the G8 again.Trump previously gave Ukraine until this coming Thursday to agree to the proposals, though later said the draft did not amount to a \"final offer\" after Ukraine's allies voiced their concerns.And Rubio told reporters on Sunday he was \"very optimistic that we're going to get there in a very reasonable period of time very soon\", whether it was Thursday, other days, or Monday the following week.Before the talks began in Geneva, Rubio and the State Department insisted the widely-leaked plan had been authored by the US.That came after a bipartisan group of US senators claimed the secretary of state had told them the draft was a Russian proposal and did not represent the Trump administration's position.Rubio rebutted that account and said it had been authored by the US with \"input\" from Moscow and Kyiv, while a State Department spokesperson described the senators' account of their conversation with Rubio as \"blatantly false\".",

    "body": "2 days agoAnthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent, WashingtonKey moments from Trump and Greene's public falloutMarjorie Taylor Greene came into Congress as one of Donald Trump's staunchest defenders. Sworn into office just days before the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol, Greene supported the president - and echoed his contention that the 2020 presidential election was \"stolen\" - when many in the Republican Party disavowed him.Now, five years later, Greene will leave Congress having been branded a \"traitor\" by the man she once revered.Over the course of just a handful of months, Greene broke with Trump in the most dramatic fashion. Although Greene had criticised Trump's decision to launch airstrikes on Iran, his support for Israel during the Gaza War and a lack of sufficient regulation of big technology companies earlier this year, the final fracture began over Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted paedophile who had connections to the wealthy and powerful. She condemned Trump's unwillingness to order his justice department to fully release its files on the case, and appeared alongside Epstein's victims – and Democrats - to force a House vote on the matter.It didn't end there, however.Greene would also question Republican strategy during the recent government shutdown, siding with Democrats in calling on her party to address expiring healthcare subsidies for low-income Americans.She publicly berated Trump for what she said was an undue emphasis on foreign policy at the expense of addressing economic and affordability concerns.\"The American people aren't motivated by foreign wars or bailouts for other countries,\" she wrote on X earlier this month. \"They want leaders who show up, do the job, and fight for them every single day!\"Getty ImagesGreene spoke at a press conference alongside US lawmakers and Epstein's accusers at the US Capitol in SeptemberGreene continued to insist that she supported Trump, but it became increasingly clear that she has a view of the \"America First\" movement that differs from the US president's. An activist turned congresswoman who made her name railing against the political establishment had now found that the Maga – \"Make America Great Again\" - movement she supported had become the establishment.And as the weight of Trump's power focused on her ouster – she broke for the exits with a few parting shots.\"I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and gets better,\" she said in her resignation statement. \"If I am cast aside by Maga Inc and replaced by Neocons, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Military Industrial War Complex, foreign leaders, and the elite donor class that can't even relate to real Americans, then many common Americans have been cast aside and replaced as well.\"Watch: Marjorie Taylor Greene announces resignation in video messageThroughout her career, she often embraced controversy and leaned into conflict. A gym instructor in Georgia, she began engaging in politics in 2016, as Trump started his successful campaign for the White House. She made frequent trips to Washington DC, where she would berate Democratic members of Congress for what she said were their socialist and pro-Islam policies.She promoted baseless QAnon conspiracy theories, questioning whether shootings in a US school were \"staged\" and alleging that the Democratic party was secretly run by a group of powerful paedophiles.Once in Congress, she clashed with Democrats - and members of her own party. Although she renounced some of her past conspiratorial views, the House voted to remove her from her committee assignments shortly after she took office.When Republicans returned to power in Congress she had a political rehabilitation of sorts, working with then Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy to consolidate conservative support in the chamber. When McCarthy was ousted, Greene fought with his replacement, Mike Johnson, and launched an unsuccessful bid to remove him as well. In 2023, she was expelled from the conservative House Freedom Caucus.She had become a political wildcard – still despised by many on the left but also viewed with suspicion by conservatives. She still had close ties with Trump, which gave her influence in Washington. And then she didn't.AFP via Getty ImagesGreene and Trump on the campaign trail in 2024In a brief interview on Friday night, Trump told ABC News that Greene's departure from Congress was \"great news for the country\".He would later post on Truth Social that Greene \"went bad\" but that he would \"always appreciate Marjorie and thank her for her service to our country\".Greene said she will return to her home in Georgia and a \"new path ahead\". Although she had reportedly expressed interest in the state's governor race next year, she recently said she would not seek that office – or seek to unseat incumbent Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff.Her decision to resign effective 5 January, however, leaves open the possibility that she could change her mind and run for office in a state where Republican politicians, like the current Georgia governor Brian Kemp, have shown that it is possible to win elections even without Trump's support.The move also allows Greene to reposition herself politically, as the Republican Party begins grappling with an environment where public support for Trump - particularly his handling of the economy - appears to be souring and the president, limited by the constitution, will never appear on a presidential ballot again.At 51, Greene's tenure in Congress may be at an end, but her involvement in American political life may be far from over.More on this story",

    "body": "8 hours agoYolande KnellMiddle East correspondent, JerusalemBBCAnera's kitchen in al-Zuwayda is one of more than 35 across Gaza providing 210,000 hot meals per dayGarlic simmers in huge metal pots heated over open wood fires and set up in a long line.Cooks add canned tomatoes and peppers with handfuls of spices, stirring the sauce with giant spoons.What is being prepared here is not just lunch, it is a lifeline.American Near East Refugee Aid (Anera) opened this community kitchen in al-Zawayda in central Gaza after the ceasefire began six weeks ago.The US humanitarian organisation has another kitchen in al-Mawasi in the south of the strip, which the BBC visited in early May.Back then, two months into an Israeli blockade, preventing the entry of all food and other goods, stocks were dwindling. Now, with more food allowed to enter, the situation has improved. Sami Matar of Anera says its kitchens are unable to secure essential proteins like meatEach day, Anera feeds a hot meal to more than 20,000 people.\"We have moved from using 15 pots in the past, and now we increased to up to 120 pots in a day, targeting more than 30 internally displaced people's camps,\" says team leader Sami Matar. \"We're serving more than 4,000 families compared to just 900 families six months ago.\"Access to food has been a constant concern since the start of the war in October 2023, with Israel heavily restricting supplies allowed through Gaza's crossings. This has exacerbated the dire humanitarian situation. Famine was confirmed in Gaza City in August and projected to spread to other areas of the strip. The UN continues to call for more aid to be allowed in.ReutersIsrael has allowed hundreds of aid lorries into Gaza daily since the ceasefire beganOn the menu today is spaghetti served with canned vegetables and tomato sauce and flavoured with generous handfuls of spices. Sami gives an approving nod as he tastes a spoonful.But while Anera is managing to get access to more food, brought into Gaza by its partner, the US humanitarian organisation World Central Kitchen, there are still vital ingredients missing to improve people's diets.\"We are mostly confined to cooking just three types of meals in a week: rice, pasta and lentils,\" Mr Matar says. \"We work hard to include vegetables like sweet peppers, onion and potatoes. This enables us to improve the taste and the nutritional value.\"\"We need the food to be more diverse, to secure fresh vegetables and essential proteins like meat and chicken,\" he goes on. \"Those essentials are not allowed to enter Gaza for humanitarian aid distribution.\"For now, fresh meat and poultry are only being imported by commercial sellers. They are too expensive for aid organisations to buy locally.Since the ceasefire, Anera has only once served a meal with meat, which came from tins. Anera says its kitchens also lack utensils, packaging and canisters of gas, with which it would be cleaner to cook.Six months ago, when a BBC freelance journalist visited the al-Mawasi kitchen, horses and carts were being used to take pots of food to the camps.Now, with some fuel entering Gaza once again, a small truck is used to transport the meals to where crowds are waiting for them.The pasta is a popular choice.A little red-haired boy squeals with delight. \"Sweetcorn and everything!\" he exclaims.Other children grin as they immediately sit on the ground and start slurping on the spaghetti, eating it with their hands.Hundreds of thousands of Gazans remain in urgent need of food assistanceIn the past week, the UN says that the daily number of meals distributed in Gaza through a network of kitchens, run by different organisations, has reached 1.4 million - up from fewer than one million meals just a month ago. The total population of the strip is over two million.Anera has a list of those vetted to receive aid in the tent camps. Most people come from northern Gaza, they have had their homes destroyed in the war, lost loved ones, and have no money.\"We live off the community kitchen, the takia,\" says Aida Salha from Gaza City. \"They bring us food, water and bread. There is bread maybe once a week or once every four days.\"The mother-of-six is living with other relatives in a borrowed tent, which she says collapsed on them during the recent heavy rain.\"I swear nothing has changed since the ceasefire,\" she continues. \"We were only happy that the constant bloodshed stopped.\"Aida Salha, a displaced mother-of-six, lives with other relatives in a borrowed tentAid agencies are pushing for Israel to open up all five crossing points into Gaza; currently only three are operating.They also want restrictions to be eased on the operations of some established humanitarian organisations - caused by Israeli registration issues - so that they can bring in their own supplies.For now, the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) reports that a quarter of households in Gaza are eating just one meal daily.It says the prices of basics such as vegetables, sunflower oil and flour have dropped on local markets, although they remain far higher than they were two years ago, before the war.In surveys, two-thirds of households reported difficulties buying food – in almost all cases because of a lack of cash.\"We've entered the third year since the war and I have no money left - no gold, no possessions. I'm totally wiped out,\" says Abdul Karim Abdul Hadi, a father-of-seven from Jabalia in northern Gaza who receives food from Anera.\"My son was martyred. All four floors of our house were destroyed. We lost two cars. We are totally destroyed. We live in a catastrophic situation every day.\"Anadolu via Getty ImagesLocal markets are coming back to life, but food prices are out of reach for many peopleWith the onset of cold, wet weather, life has been getting harder.Aid workers like Sami Matar, do their best to help those living in the camps.\"The conversations we have with the families in the camps are heartbreaking,\" he says.\"The overwhelming feelings are deep uncertainty and exhaustion. They see no clear path to return to their homes. They worry how to keep their children warm and fed.\"After the UN Security Council approved the Trump blueprint for Gaza this week, people are waiting to see what happens next.They know the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas remains shaky but desperately need it to stick.\"The future hope is very simple,\" Mr Matar says. \"People want to live in a safe secure place and be able to cook a hot meal for their children with love and dignity.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoHelen LivingstoneSydneyGetty ImagesThe ban on under-16s using social media is a world firstFrom 10 December, social media companies will have to take \"reasonable steps\" to ensure that under-16s in Australia cannot set up accounts on their platforms and that existing accounts are deactivated or removed.The government says the ban - a world-first policy popular with many parents - is aimed at reducing the \"pressures and risks\" children can be exposed to on social media, which come from \"design features that encourage them to spend more time on screens, while also serving up content that can harm their health and wellbeing\".A study commissioned by the government earlier this year said 96% of children aged 10-15 used social media and that seven out of 10 of them had been exposed to harmful content and behaviour. This behaviour ranged from misogynistic material to fight videos and content promoting eating disorders and suicide.  One in seven also reported experiencing grooming-type behaviour from adults or older children, and more than half said they had been the victims of cyberbullying.What platforms are affected?The Australian government has so far named ten platforms to be included in the ban: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube, Reddit and streaming platforms Kick and Twitch. It is also under pressure to expand the ban to online gaming. Fearing they may be targeted, gaming platforms such as Roblox and Discord have recently introduced age checks on some features in an apparent bid to ward off inclusion in the ban. The government has said it will continue to review the list of affected platforms, and will consider three main criteria when doing so.These comprise whether the platform's sole or \"significant purpose\" is to enable online social interaction between two or more users; whether it allows users to interact with some or all other users; and whether it allows users to post material.YouTube Kids, Google Classroom and WhatsApp are not included as they were not deemed to have met those criteria. Children will also still be available to view most content on platforms like YouTube, which do not require an account.How will the ban be enforced?Children and parents will not be punished for infringing the ban - it is social media companies who are charged with enforcing it, and they face fines of up to $49.5m (US$32m, £25m) for serious or repeated breaches. The government says these companies must take \"reasonable steps\" to keep kids off their platforms, and use age assurance technologies - without specifying which ones.Several possibilities have been raised, including the use of government IDs, face or voice recognition and age inference. The latter of these uses online information other than a date of birth - such as online behaviour or interactions - to estimate a person's age.Getty ImagesA recent Australian government study found 96% of children aged 10-15 used social media - and seven out of 10 of them had been exposed to harmful content and behaviourThe government is encouraging platforms to use multiple different methods. It has also said platforms cannot rely on users declaring their own age, or on parents vouching for their children.Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, has announced it will begin closing teen accounts from 4 December. Those mistakenly kicked off could use a government ID or provide a video selfie to verify their age, the company said. Snapchat has said users can use bank accounts or photo IDs to verify their age or take a selfie, which will be used to estimate their age.The other affected platforms have not yet said how they will comply with the ban.Will it work? Without a clear idea of what methods companies will be using, it's hard to say whether the social media ban will be effective - but concerns have been raised that age assurance technologies may wrongly block some users while failing to spot others who are underage.The government's own report found that facial assessment technology, for example, is least reliable for the exact demographic it's needed to target.Questions have also been raised as to whether the fines for infringement are big enough. As former Facebook executive Stephen Scheeler told AAP: \"It takes Meta about an hour and 52 minutes to make $50 million in revenue\".Critics argue that the ban, even if properly implemented, will not actually reduce online harm for children. Dating websites and gaming platforms are not included, and nor are AI chatbots, which have recently made headlines for allegedly encouraging children to commit suicide and for having \"sensual\" conversations with minors.Others point out that teens who rely on social media for community will be left isolated, and argue that educating children about how to navigate social media would be more effective.Communications Minister Annika Wells has conceded that the ban may not be \"perfect\". \"It's going to look a bit untidy on the way through,\" she said in early November. \"Big reforms always do.\"Are there data protection concerns?Critics have also raised concerns about the large-scale collection and storage of data that will be required, and its potential mishandling, as platforms try to verify users' ages. Australia - like much of the world - has in recent years seen a series of high-profile data breaches, including several where sensitive personal information was stolen and sold or published.But the government says the legislation incorporates \"strong protections\" for personal information. These protections stipulate that such information may not be used for anything other than age verification and must be destroyed once that has been done, with \"serious penalties\" for breaches. It also says platforms must offer an alternative to the use of governments IDs for age assurance.How have social media companies responded?Social media companies were aghast at the announcement of the ban in November 2024. They argued it would be difficult to implement, easy to circumvent and time consuming for users, as well as posing risks to their privacy. They also suggested it would drive children into dark corners of the internet and deprive young people of social contact. Snap - which owns Snapchat - and YouTube also denied being social media companies. YouTube's parent company, Google, is reportedly still considering whether to launch a legal challenge to the platform's inclusion. It did not respond to a BBC request for comment. Getty ImagesThough included in the ban, YouTube has denied being a social media companyEven as it announced that it would implement it early, Meta argued the ban would leave teens with \"inconsistent protections across the many apps they use\". At parliamentary hearings in October, TikTok and Snap said they still opposed the ban but would implement it. Kick - the only Australian company included in the ban - has said it will introduce a \"range of measures\" and continue to engage \"constructively\" with authorities.Do other countries have similar bans?The ban on under-16s using social media is a world first, and other countries will be watching closely. Different approaches have been tried elsewhere to limit screen and social media time for children and keep them from accessing harmful material, but nowhere has put a total ban on the platforms involved.In the UK, new safety rules introduced in July mean online companies face large fines or even the jailing of their executives if they fail to implement measures to protect young people from seeing illegal and harmful content.Other European countries allow the use of social media under a certain age only with parental consent. In September, a French parliamentary enquiry recommended banning under-15s from social media, as well as a social media \"curfew\" for 15- to 18-year-olds.Denmark has announced plans to ban social media for under-15s, while Norway is considering a similar proposal. Spain's government has sent to parliament a draft law for under-16s to require their legal guardians to authorise access.Meanwhile, an attempt in the US state of Utah to ban under-18s from social media without parental consent was blocked by a federal judge last year.Will children try to get around the ban?Teens interviewed by the BBC said they were opening new accounts with fake ages ahead of the ban - although the government has warned social media companies it expects them to detect such accounts and remove them.Online, teenagers are also recommending alternative social media apps or giving tips they hope will help them bypass the ban.Some teens, including influencers, have switched to joint accounts with their parents. Commentators are also predicting a surge in the use of VPNs - which hide the country a person is accessing the internet from - as happened in the UK after the implementation of age control rules.",

    "body": "23 hours agoDanai Nesta KupembaBBC NewsAn Australian man who jumped over a barricade and grabbed Hollywood star Ariana Grande has been deported and banned from Singapore.Johnson Wen, 26, was sentenced to nine days in prison for being a public nuisance and has now been \"barred from re-entering Singapore\", the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) told local media. Wen pushed past photographers and charged at the actress and singer, who was attending the Asian premier for Wicked: For Good on 13 November. Co-star Cynthia Erivo wrestled him away from Grande. Wen has a history of disrupting concerts and celebrity events, including jumping on stage at Katy Perry's Sydney concert in June this year.The incident sparked outrage in Singapore, with many accusing him of re-traumatising Grande. The pop star has spoken of experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder after a suicide bomb attack at her concert in Manchester in May 2017 killed 22 people and injured hundreds.During Wen's trial, the court heard he had attempted to intrude on the film's premiere twice, according to Singaporean media.He then made a second attempt to jump the barricades. Security staff stopped him and pinned him down.Wen later posted videos thanking Grande for letting him on the carpet and said he was \"free\". Police arrested him the next day and charged him with public nuisance, to which Wen pleaded guilty. The District Judge Christopher Goh was quoted by Channel News Asia as saying that Wen was \"attention seeking\", adding that he was wrong to think he would not suffer any consequences. Grande has not commented on the case. Erivo spoke about the incident to NBC, saying that she \"just wanted to make sure my friend was safe\".\"I'm sure he didn't mean us harm, but you never know with those things, and I wanted to make sure that she was OK. That was my first instinct,\" she said. ",

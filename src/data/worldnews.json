    "body": "18 hours agoGrace Tsoi,BBC World ServiceandBBC News Chinese,Hong KongBBCJimmy Lai, 78, faces life in prison for national security offencesOn a winter morning in 2022 Raphael Wong and Figo Chan walked into Hong Kong's Stanley prison to meet Jimmy Lai, the media billionaire who had been arrested two years before and was awaiting trial charged with national security offences.They had all been part of the turbulent protests that had rocked Hong Kong in 2019, when hundreds of thousands took to the streets demanding democracy and more freedom in the Chinese territory. They would also often meet for dinner, sometimes lavish meals, gossiping and bantering over dim sum, pizza or claypot rice.In prison, he \"loved eating rice with pickled ginger,\" Chan said. \"No-one could have imagined Jimmy Lai would eat something like that!\"But neither had they imagined a reunion at a maximum security prison, the protests crushed, friends and fellow activists jailed, Hong Kong just as boisterous and yet, changed. And gone was the owner of the irreverent nickname \"Fatty Lai\": he had lost considerable weight.Decades apart - Lai in his 70s, Wong and Chan about 40 years younger - they had still dreamed of a different Hong Kong. Lai was a key figure in the protests, wielding his most influential asset, the hugely popular newspaper, Apple Daily, in the hope of shaping Hong Kong into a liberal democracy. That proved risky under a contentious national security law imposed in 2020 by China's Communist Party rulers in Beijing.Lai always said he owed Hong Kong. Although he is a UK citizen, he refused to leave. \"I got everything I have because of this place,\" he told the BBC hours before he was arrested in 2020. \"This is my redemption,\" he said, choking up.He wanted the city to continue to have the freedom it had given him. That's what drove his politics - fiercely critical of the Communist Party and avowedly supportive of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. It cost him his own freedom.Watch: Jimmy Lai's last interview as a free man in 2020Lai harboured \"a rabid hatred\" of the Chinese Communist Party and \"an obsession to change the Party's values to those of the Western world\", the High Court ruled in December when it convicted him. It said that Lai had hoped the party would be ousted - or, at the very least, that its leader Xi Jinping would be removed.Lai was found guilty on all counts of charges he had always denied, including sedition under a separate colonial-era law.  The most serious one, colluding with foreign forces, carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.On 9 February, the court jailed him for 20 years in a hearing that lasted less than 30 minutes. It is the harshest sentence given so far under the NSL - \"an effective death sentence\", given his age, according to rights groups.    \"Never,\" Lai had said to the charge of collusion when he testified, arguing that he had only advocated for what he believed were Hong Kong's values: \"rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly\".His conviction in December was welcomed by Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee, who said Lai had used his newspaper to \"wantonly create social conflicts\" and \"glorify violence\". The law, he added, never allows anyone to harm the country \"under the guise of human rights, democracy and freedom\".Getty ImagesLai's wife Teresa and son Shun-yan at court for Lai's verdict, along with Cardinal Joseph Zen, former bishop of Hong Kong who baptised Lai in 1997 Back in 2022, before Wong and Chan left the prison, Lai asked them to pray with him, to Wong's surprise.Lai's Catholic faith had deepened in solitary confinement - an arrangement he had requested, according to authorities. He prayed six hours a day and he made drawings of Christ, which he sent in the mail to friends. \"Even though he was suffering,\" Wong said, \"he didn't complain nor was he afraid. He was at peace.\"Peace was not what Jimmy Lai had pursued for much of his life - not when he fled China as a 12-year-old, not while he worked his way up the gruelling factory chain, not even after he became a famous Hong Kong tycoon, and certainly not as his media empire took on Beijing.For Lai, Hong Kong was everything that China was not - deeply capitalist, a land of opportunity and limitless wealth, and free. In the city, which was still a British colony when he arrived in 1959, he found success - and then a voice.Apple Daily became one of the top-selling papers almost instantly after its debut in 1995. Modelled on USA Today, it revolutionised the aesthetics and layout of newspapers, and kicked off a cut-throat price war.From a guide to hiring prostitutes in the \"adult section\" to investigative reports, to columns by economists and novelists, it was a \"buffet\" targeting \"a full range of readers\", said Francis Lee, a journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Former editors and employees spoke of Lai's encouragement - \"If you dared to do it, he would dare to let you do it\" - and his temper. One said he often swore.They describe him as unconventional, and as a visionary who wasn't afraid to bet on experiments. \"Even before the iPhone was launched, he kept saying mobile phones would be the future,\" recalled one of the paper's editors, adding that he was full of ideas. \"It was as if he asked us to create a new website every day.\"It had been the same when he owned a clothing label. \"He was not afraid of disrupting the industry, and he was not afraid of making enemies,\" said Herbert Chow, a former marketing director at a rival brand.That was both his making and undoing, Chow said: \"Otherwise, there would have been no Apple Daily. Of course, he wouldn't have ended up like this either.\"An early TV commercial for Apple Daily featured the then 48-year-old Lai biting the forbidden fruit while dozens of arrows took aim at him.It became a self-fulfilling prophecy.Jimmylai.substack.comThe Apple Daily commercial when it launched in 1995Escape from ChinaIt was his first taste of chocolate that beckoned Lai to Hong Kong as a boy.After carrying a passenger's luggage at a railway station in China, Lai was given a tip, and a bar of chocolate. He took a bite. \"I asked him where he's from. He said Hong Kong. I said, 'Hong Kong must be heaven' because I had never tasted anything like that,\" Lai said of the encounter in a 2007 documentary, The Call of the Entrepreneur.Life in Mao Zedong's China was punctuated by waves of oppressive campaigns - to industrialise China overnight, to weed out capitalist \"class enemies\". The Lais, once a family of business people, were blacklisted. His father fled to Hong Kong, leaving them behind. His mother was sent to a labour camp.Decades later, Lai wrote of how of he and his sisters would be dragged out of their homes to watch a crowd forcing their mother to kneel while she was shoved and taunted - cruel public shaming that soon became the norm. The first time, Lai wrote, was terrifying: \"My tears flowed freely and wet my shirt. I dared not make a move. My body was burning with humiliation.\"Uncowed, his grandmother finished every story with the same message: \"You have to become a businessman even if you only sell seasoned peanuts!\"And so, at the age of 12, he set off for Hong Kong, among millions who fled the mainland - and Mao's devastating rule - over the years.The day he arrived, on the bottom of a fishing boat, along with about 80 seasick travellers, he was hired by a mitten factory. He described the long working hours as a \"very happy time, a time that I knew I had a future\". It was there that one of his co-workers helped him learn English. Years later, he would give interviews and even testify at court in fluent English.By his early 20s, he was managing a textile factory and after making money on the stock market, he started his own, Comitex Knitters. He was 27.Getty ImagesJimmy Lai at his home in Hong Kong in 1993 Business often took Lai to New York, and on one of those trips, he was lent a book that came to define his worldview: The Road to Serfdom by Nobel Prize-winning economist Friedrich Hayek, a champion of free-market capitalism. \"People's spontaneous reaction\" and \"the exchange of information\" have created the best in the world, was his takeaway. To him, that was Hong Kong's strength.The book spurred a voracious reading habit. He would read the same book multiple times, and read every book by authors he admired.  \"I want to turn the author's thoughts into my backyard garden. I want to buy a garden, not cut flowers,\" he said in a 2009 interview.After a decade in manufacturing, he was \"bored\" and founded the clothing chain Giordano in 1981, which became a fast-fashion pioneer. It was so successful that Tadashi Yanai sought advice from Lai when his Japanese label Uniqlo opened shops.Lai launched stores in China, which had begun to open up after Mao died. He was \"excited\", China \"was going to be changed, like a Western country\", he said in the 2007 documentary.Giordano sold tees with photos of Tiananmen protest leaders and anti-Beijing slogans, and put up pro-democracy banners in stores across Hong Kong.A million people marched in Hong Kong in solidarity with student protesters in Beijing. Until 2020, Hong Kong held the largest vigil that mourned the massacre.Lai said later that he \"didn't feel anything about China\" until then. He had always wanted to forget that part of his life but \"all of a sudden, it was like my mother was calling in the darkness of the night\".Getty ImagesLai was a frequent attendee at Hong Kong 's annual vigils in memory of those who died at Tiananmen Square in 1989'Choice is freedom'The following year Lai launched a magazine called Next, and in 1994 published an open letter to Li Peng, \"the Butcher of Beijing\" who played a key role in the Tiananmen massacre. He called him \"the son of a turtle egg with zero intelligence\".Beijing was furious. Between 1994 and 1996, Giordano's flagship store in Beijing and 11 franchises in Shanghai closed. Lai sold his shares and stepped down as chairman.\"If I just go on making money, it doesn't mean anything to me. But if I go into the media business, then I deliver information, which is choice, and choice is freedom,\" Lai said in the 2007 documentary.He soon became a \"very active participant\" in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, meeting leaders to discuss strategy, said Lee Wing Tat, a former lawmaker from the Democratic Party.He became an outspoken critic of the CCP, writing in 1994: \"I entirely oppose the Communist Party because I hate everything that restrains personal liberties.\" He also started to voice concerns about the looming handover of Hong Kong, from Britain to China, in 1997. \"After more than a century of colonial rule, Hong Kongers feel proud to return to the embrace of the motherland,\" he wrote. \"But should we love the motherland even if it doesn't have freedom?\"During the handover, however, China's then-leader Jiang Zemin promised that Hongkongers would govern Hong Kong and the city would have a high degree of autonomy for the next 50 years.Getty ImagesLai at an \"Occupy Central\" protest in Admiralty in October 2014The 2014 Umbrella Movement sparked by Beijing's refusal to allow completely free elections in Hong Kong became another turning point for Lai.Protesters occupied the city's main commercial districts for 79 days. Lai turned up from 9am to 5pm every day, undeterred after a man threw animal entrails at him. \"When the police started firing tear gas, I was with Fatty,\" the former lawmaker Lee recalled.The movement ended when the court ordered protest sites to be cleared, but the government did not budge. Five years later, in 2019, Hong Kong erupted again, this time because of a controversial plan that would have allowed extradition to mainland China.What began as peaceful marches became increasingly violent, turning the city into a battleground for six months. Black-clad protesters threw bricks and Molotov cocktails, stormed parliament and started fires; riot police fired tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons and live rounds.Lai was at the forefront of the protests and served 20 months for participating in four unauthorised assemblies. A protester told the BBC he was surprised to see Lai: \"To me, he's a busy businessman, but he showed up.\"Getty ImagesLai at a pro-democracy march in 2019 Apple Daily provided blanket coverage or, as critics would argue, a sounding board for an anti-government movement.Government adviser Ronny Tong said Lai was \"instrumental\" in the protests because Apple Daily carried a \"totally false\" slogan – anti-extradition to China – which \"caught the imagination of people who wanted to cause havoc in Hong Kong\".Whether Apple Daily played a seditious role, and how much control Lai exerted over its stance was at the centre of his 156-day national security trial.Lai instructed the editorial team to \"urge people to take to the streets\", according to Cheung Kim-hung, former chief executive of Apple Daily's parent company Next Digital, and a defendant-turned-prosecution witness. After the National Security Law took effect, the newspaper was raided twice and eventually shut down in 2021.During the height of the protests, Lai flew to the US where he met then Vice-President Mike Pence to discuss the situation in Hong Kong. A month before the National Security Law was imposed, Lai launched a controversial campaign, despite internal pushback, urging Apple Daily readers to send letters to then US President Donald Trump to \"save Hong Kong\".All of this, the court ruled, amounted to a public appeal for a foreign government to interfere in Hong Kong's internal affairs.\"Nobody in their right mind should think that Hong Kong can undergo any kind of political reform without at least tacit acceptance from Beijing,\" Tong said. The protests in 2014 and 2019 \"are totally against common sense\".Getty ImagesCopies of the last Apple Daily newspaper early on June 24, 2021Beijing says Hong Kong has now moved from \"chaos to governance\" and onto \"greater prosperity\" because of the national security law and a \"patriot-only\" parliament. But critics, including hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers who have since left, say dissent has been stifled, and the city's freedoms severely curbed.Lee, the lawmaker, is among them: \"When I first came to the UK, I had nightmares. I felt very guilty. Why could we live in other places freely, while our good friends were jailed?\"Lai's family has been calling for his release for years, citing concerns for his health because he is diabetic, but their calls have been rejected so far. The government and Lai's Hong Kong legal team have said that his medical needs are being met.Carmen Tsang, Lai's daughter-in-law who lives in Hong Kong with her family, says her children miss grandpa - and the big family dinners he hosted every two weeks. His loud voice scared her daughter when she was younger, but \"they loved going to grandpa's place… They think he's a funny guy\".She is not sure today's Hong Kong has a place for Lai. \"If there's a speck of dust in your eye, you just get rid of it, right?\"Watch: What does the Jimmy Lai verdict mean for democracy in Hong Kong?",

Attempts by Kim to defuse the outrage with an apology a day after the town hall appear to have failed.The town hall had been called to discuss a potential merger between the province where Jindo County is located and a nearby city - something regions with shrinking  populations are looking at for administrative reasons.Kim said his comment had been intended to highlight population issues in rural regions but admitted the language he had used was \"inappropriate\", local media reported.South Jeolla Province also issued a formal apology for Kim's \"inappropriate remarks\", which it said \"has caused deep pain to Vietnamese people and to women\", local media reported.The Vietnamese Embassy in Seoul had condemned Kim's remarks, saying in a statement on Facebook that his words were \"not simply a matter of expression but a matter of values and attitudes towards migrant women and minority groups\".Sri Lanka authorities have not publicly addressed the controversy.The Democratic Party's Supreme Council had voted unanimously to expel Kim, a party spokesperson told reporters on Monday.Meanwhile, activists for women and migrant rights are reportedly planning to hold a rally in front of Jindo County Office on Tuesday over Kim's comments.",

    "body": "4 hours agoYang TianGetty ImagesVenezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado said her opposition colleague Juan Pablo Guanipa has been kidnapped just hours after being released from detention.The Nobel Peace Prize winner said on Sunday that Guanipa, leader of the Justice First party, was taken in the Los Chorros neighbourhood of the capital, Caracas.\"Heavily armed men dressed in civilian clothes arrived in four vehicles and took him away by force,\" she wrote on social media early on Monday. A former vice-president of the National Assembly, Guanipa spent eight months in prison and was among several political prisoners released since the US seized Venezuela's then-president Nicolás Maduro in January.Guanipa's centre-right party said he had been kidnapped by the \"repressive forces of the dictatorship\" while he was moving between locations.They added that those accompanying him said weapons were pointed at the group before Guanipa was loaded into a car.\"We hold Delcy Rodríguez, Jorge Rodríguez, and Diosdado Cabello responsible for any harm to Juan Pablo's life,\" Justice First wrote on social media, referring to Venezuela's interim president, the National Assembly speaker, and the interior minister respectively. The party also called on the international community to demand the \"immediate release\" of Guanipa and an end to the Venezuelan government's \"persecution of the opposition\".Another key figure in Venezuela's opposition, Edmundo González, demanded proof of life, saying on X that the \"absence of information\" on Guanipa's whereabouts \"constitutes a forced disappearance\".Just hours earlier, Guanipa's son Ramón was celebrating his father's release on social media: \"Our entire family will be able to hug again soon.\" He subsequently posted a video online, in which he demanded immediate proof that his father was still alive.\"I hold the regime responsible for anything that happens to my father. Enough of this repression,\" Ramón Guanipa said in the video.Guanipa was among at least 30 people freed on Sunday, according to Foro Penal, which provides assistance to political prisoners in Venezuela.The leader of the Justice First party, he was elected governor of the Zulia region in 2017 but was barred from taking office after he refused to swear an oath before Maduro's National Constituent Assembly.Guanipa went into hiding after being accused of terrorism and treason for challenging the 2024 election result.He was tracked down by Venezuela's security forces and detained in May 2025. Opposition and human rights groups say the government under Maduro had for years used detentions of political prisoners to stamp out dissent and silence critics.",

    "body": "7 hours agoJack BurgessWorld Without ExploitationSurvivors appeared in the advert with black redaction marks over their mouthsSurvivors of late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have appeared in an advert calling for the release of more files related to him.In the 40 second video from the World Without Exploitation group, released in the US on Super Bowl Sunday, survivors held up photographs of their younger selves and said \"we all deserve the truth\".The US Department of Justice (DOJ) was required by law to make all the files public in December last year. However, only some have been released - many with redactions.The DOJ said files not published were either unrelated, duplicates, or had been withheld under deliberative process or attorney-client privilege, or because they depicted violence.Deliberative process privilege allows US government agencies to withhold documents which reflect decision-making processes, while attorney-client privilege is intended to protect the confidentiality of communications between lawyers and clients.Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche said last month that the most recent release of material, on 30 January, \"marks the end of a very comprehensive document identification and review process\".Blanche also said there was a \"built in assumption that somehow there's this hidden tranche of information of men that we know about that we're covering up or that we're not we're choosing not to prosecute\", before adding \"that is not the case\".Sunday's advert featuring the survivors began with a text slate on screen that said: \"On November 19, 2025, the Epstein Files Transparency Act was signed into law.\" It continued with a statement that said: \"3 MILLION FILES Still Have Not Been Released.\"The survivors appeared with black redaction marks over their mouths, addressed the camera directly and each said \"we're standing together\". The advert concluded with a call for people to \"stand with us\" and \"Tell Attorney General Pam Bondi IT'S TIME FOR THE TRUTH\".While the video was released on the day of the Super Bowl it was not aired on television during the match, which traditionally has the largest television audience in the US.The group told the Reuters news agency it could not afford to air a commercial during the game, noting that a 30-second Super Bowl advertisement can cost \"more than $8 million (£5.9m)\".The DOJ's release of documents has shed light on the disgraced financier's close association with many prominent people. However, the justice department has faced heavy scrutiny after missing the 19 December deadline to release all files as mandated in the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which passed Congress and was signed into law in November.Ghislaine Maxwell, the jailed associate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, is scheduled to appear before the congressional committee investigating the federal government's handling of the Epstein files on Monday.She has agreed to testify under oath but her legal team previously said she would decline to answer questions under her constitutional right to remain silent unless she is granted legal immunity.",

    "body": "Fifteen killed in latest Lebanon building collapse, as warnings of neglect grow7 hours agoSamantha GranvilleBeirutReutersAll residents have been accounted for but officials have warned other people could still be missingThe death toll from the collapse of two residential buildings in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli has risen to 15, state media say.Eight people were rescued alive, Civil Defence director general Imad Khreiss said.Khreiss said the two adjoining buildings were home to 22 residents, but local municipal authorities warned people could still be missing.Social media footage captured the moment the buildings collapsed, with one side giving way at the lower floors before both structures fell almost simultaneously.The latest disaster is the fifth residential building collapse in Tripoli this winter, highlighting growing concerns over old and undermaintained buildings in Lebanon's poorest city.The footage shows a thick cloud of dust and debris engulfing the street as the buildings folded in on one another.After the collapse, large crowds gathered around the site of a crater where the buildings had stood.Tripoli's mayor, Abdel Hamid Karimeh, said the city had suffered long-term dereliction.\"Thousands of our people in Tripoli are threatened due to years of neglect,\" he said. \"The situation is beyond the capabilities of the Tripoli municipality.\"He later announced he had submitted his resignation to the interior minister, describing Tripoli as \"disaster-stricken.\"President Joseph Aoun said he was \"monitoring developments\" and called on rescue workers across the country to mobilise. Prime Minister Nawaf Salam described the buildings collapse as a \"humanitarian catastrophe\" and said the government was ready to help.\"The government is fully prepared to provide accommodation for all residents of buildings that need to be evacuated,\" he said, adding that the disaster was the \"results of years of accumulated neglect\".The collapse comes days after residents were evacuated from a nearby building following structural cracking, and two weeks after another deadly collapse, where a father and daughter were killed.Tripoli is Lebanon's second-largest city and has seen repeated building failures amid years of economic crisis, lack of maintenance, and weak regulation.Last month, the head of the Higher Relief Authority said more than 100 buildings in the city required evacuation warnings.Many residential blocks across Lebanon were built illegally or without permits, especially during the 1975-1990 civil war, while others have been expanded with additional floors without proper oversight, authorities say, leaving thousands at risk, especially during the cold and wet winter months.In a statement, the national syndicate for property owners said the collapse was the result of \"blatant negligence and shortcomings of the Lebanese state toward the safety of citizens and their housing security,\" and urged the government to carry out a nationwide assessment of buildings at risk of collapse.",

    "body": "12 hours agoBasillioh RukangaAFP via Getty ImagesSenegalese police have pledged to pursue and dismantle such crime networksSenegalese police say they have arrested 14 people and broken up a paedophile gang operating between the country and France.Those arrested, who are all Senegalese, were part of a \"transnational\" criminal group that has been in operation since 2017, according to a police statement.It said the group was accused of \"organised paedophilia, pimping, rape of minors under 15, sodomy, and intentional transmission of HIV/Aids\".  They allegedly repeatedly forced boys to have \"unprotected sex\" with men who were mostly HIV-positive and filmed it.Four of the accused are said to have been acting \"on the instructions\" of a Frenchman arrested in France in April 2025 \"in exchange for money transfers\".The 14 accused were brought before a judge on Friday following searches in several neighbourhoods in Dakar, and the city of Kaolack, 200km (124 miles) south-east of the capital.A police statement released on Sunday said coordinated raids had been carried out at the homes of the various suspects, with items believed to be linked to the alleged crimes seized.\"The DIC [Criminal Investigations Division] carried out a major operation, dismantling a transnational organised criminal group whose members are based primarily between France and Senegal,\" the police said.The statement said the operation was conducted through cooperation between Senegal and France, with a delegation of French officers involved in the mission.The police have pledged to continue pursuing and dismantling such criminal networks and have released a toll-free number for the public to report any relevant information.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "13 hours agoKoh Ewe,news reporter,Shaimaa Khalil,Tokyo correspondentandOsmond Chia,business reporterAFP via Getty ImagesThe Nikkei 225 briefly surpassed 57,000 for the first time after the electionJapanese stocks surged to a record high on Monday, as Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) basked in a historic election victory.The LDP secured 316 out of 465 seats in Sunday's election, the first time a single party has won a two-thirds lower house majority since Japan's parliament was established in its current form in 1947.The Japan Innovation Party, the LDP's coalition partner, won in 36 more constituencies, taking their combined total to 352 seats.The resounding mandate is a gamble that paid off for Takaichi, who now faces the challenge of reviving Japan's moribund economy and tackling cost-of-living woes. The Nikkei 225 index rallied by more than 5% in early trade on Monday, briefly crossing the 57,000 mark for the first time. It then gave up some gains, but still closed up 3.9% at a record high of 56,363.94.The LDP's decisive win will help Takaichi advance her pro-business policies without having to negotiate extensively with opposition parties.Takaichi told reporters on Sunday that she would pursue a \"responsible yet aggressive\" fiscal policy and would not reshuffle the Cabinet, which was formed less than four months ago.Japan's first female prime minister called the snap election last month, just a few months after taking office in October. Her success is in marked contrast to her two predecessors, under whom the party lost its parliamentary majority, battled corruption scandals and struggled to curb rising costs.Markets commentators say Takaichi's policies could boost the Japanese economy. The election outcome and upcoming moves like \"stimulus, tax tweaks, and deregulation\" will be \"additional fuel for an existing bull trend\", investment analyst Yuka Marosek told the BBC.Chris Scicluna, head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets Europe, said Japanese stock investors had \"long been believers in Takaichi\".\"They're confident that Japanese firms will benefit from her pledge to end austerity, they love her promises of more investment to boost growth, [and] they like the fact she's identified several strategic sectors such as defence and AI to benefit from extra policy support,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.However, he added that investors in Japanese government bonds and the yen were \"a lot more agnostic if not downright sceptical\" about Takaichi's intentions.\"Japanese government debt's extremely high and investors in bonds and the yen want to know how she intends to finance her plans,\" he said.Historically low inflation in the country has made it very sensitive to the rising cost of living over recent years.At this election, voters at polling stations told the BBC that they were worried about the increasing costs of groceries and rent.The economy is also under pressure from the country's ageing population, which has seen a shrinking workforce and ballooning social care costs.Takaichi has pledged to cut taxes and boost the Japanese economy through more spending - though where that money will come from is another big concern, given Japan's high government debt. Critics warn this could deepen instability in Japan's already fragile economy.\"We bear an extremely heavy responsibility to focus on steadily delivering on the campaign pledges we have made,\" Takaichi said on Sunday as her party's victory became clear, Kyodo reported.The LDP had lost its parliamentary majority under Takaichi's predecessor Shigeru Ishiba. And Takaichi banked on her personal appeal to turn the LDP's lost fortunes around.She has consolidated support among the LDP's conservative base by reviving long-dormant goals like revision to Japan's pacifist constitution and emphasising traditional values.But she has also connected with younger voters in a way not seen before: her handbags and pink pens have become unlikely zeitgeist items.US President Donald Trump congratulated Takaichi on her victory, writing on Truth Social that it was an \"Honor\" to endorse her ahead of the election.\"The wonderful people of Japan, who voted with such enthusiasm, will always have my strong support,\" Trump said.Just one week after Takaichi took office in October last year, Tokyo rolled out the red carpet for Trump when he visited Japan. It was her diplomatic debut, and the optics were striking: fists pumping as the US president praised her in front of thousands of US soldiers.Takaichi is due to travel to Washington in March for a second meeting with Trump.

    "body": "6 hours agoJean OtalorAFP via Getty ImagesThe migrants were travelling in a rubber dinghy similar to this, when it capsized off the coast of LibyaA rubber boat carrying 55 passengers, including two babies, has overturned off the coast of Libya, the UN migration agency says.The only survivors, two Nigerian women, were rescued by the Libyan authorities on Friday, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) announced on Monday.  The boat was carrying migrants and refugees from various African countries, it said.The boat sank after taking on water approximately six hours after departing from the coastal city of al-Zawiya in north-western Libya.The IOM says that almost 500 migrants have been reported dead or missing trying the cross the Mediterranean Sea from Libya so far in 2026.Libya has become a staging point for migrants from sub-Saharan Africa seeking to reach Europe since long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi was killed in 2011.Survivors told IOM that the rubber dinghy had departed at around 23:00 local time from al-Zawiya, west of Tripoli. It overturned several hours later in the early hours of Friday north of Zuwara.It is not immediately clear why it has taken so long for the news to emerge.One of the two survivors said she had lost her husband, while the other reported that her two babies had died, the agency said. IOM teams provided both women with emergency medical care.IOM says at least 375 migrants were reported dead or missing in January alone after a series of \"invisible\" shipwrecks in the central Mediterranean during periods of extreme winter weather. The true toll is feared to be higher.Despite the repeated tragedies, migrants continue to attempt the crossing. IOM says traffickers and smuggling networks profit by forcing people onto overcrowded and unseaworthy vessels, contributing to the mounting death toll.The agency has urged stronger international cooperation to dismantle smuggling and trafficking networks, alongside the creation of safe and legal migration pathways to reduce deaths at sea.Many vessels that sink are never reported by the people smugglers who operate them. Those who die simply vanish, their families left without ever knowing what happened to them.Several countries, including the UK, Spain, Norway and Sierra Leone, have called on Libya to shut down detention centres where rights groups say migrants have been tortured, abused or killed.More about migrants from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "15 hours agoKaty Watson,Australia correspondentandSimon AtkinsonBBCMany of the victims had moved to New Zealand to work or study, and some were refugees who thought they had found safetyA white supremacist who killed 51 people at two New Zealand mosques has appeared in court to try and withdraw his guilty plea.Australian Brenton Tarrant is serving a life sentence with no parole after admitting to murdering the 51 people and attempting to murder another 40 in the March 2019 attack on worshippers during Friday prayers in Christchurch.He initially denied the charges, but changed his plea a year after the attack.The 35-year-old, who also admitted one count of terrorism, has now launched an appeal, filed out of time, arguing he was incapable of making rational decisions at the time because of \"torturous and inhumane\" conditions in prison. He also wants to appeal against his sentence. The hearing at New Zealand's Court of Appeal in Wellington is scheduled to run all week, with Tarrant expected to give evidence via video link.The massacre at Al Noor mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre - parts of which were live-streamed - led to stricter gun laws in New Zealand.'He wants to open traumas again'Victims and family members will be able to watch the hearing via a delayed broadcast.Among those planning to attend is Aya al-Umari, who lost her older brother Hussein in the attack on Al Noor mosque.\"I very distinctly remember that I left court after the sentencing thinking 'Right, the trauma chapter is now closed, time to heal, time to focus on your own mental well-being', but then it pops up again and again,\" al-Umari told the BBC.She said she was preparing for a tough week, seeing the man who murdered her brother on screen.\"It will be just an image that I am looking at, because he means absolutely nothing to me at this stage.\"I suspect one of his main motivations to do this is to open up traumas again and I won't let him succeed in doing that - he just wants his limelight and to be relevant again.\"Hussein al-Umari was awarded a New Zealand Bravery Star, for standing up to Tarrant.\"He took the right of life of my brother and 50 others, and then we're going to sit through now and talk about the legal arguments of his right to appeal,\" al-Umari  said. \"When you place those two together, they are morally not comparable.\"Family handoutAya al-Umari and her brother HusseinAt the time of the sentencing in August 2020, then Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern said life imprisonment without parole meant Tarrant would have \"no notoriety, no platform... and we have no cause to think about him, to see him or to hear from him again\".If the three appeal court judges decide he can withdraw his guilty plea, the case would potentially go to trial on all charges.If he is not allowed to retract his plea, there will be another hearing later in the year to consider his appeal against his sentence.Tarrant was born in New South Wales, Australia, but moved to New Zealand in 2017 - which, prosecutors said, was when he started planning his attacks against the Muslim community.He was active on fringe online forums and before the attack, he had posted a 74-page \"manifesto\" online.The massacre prompted New Zealand to pass stricter gun laws and buy back certain types of weapons from owners.Within a month of the shootings, the country's parliament had voted overwhelmingly to ban military-style semi-automatic weapons as well as parts that could be used to build prohibited firearms.The government offered to compensate owners of newly-illegal weapons in a buy-back scheme.",

    "body": "10 hours agoDamian ZaneBBCThere are fears that a conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea could break out once againEritrea has hit back at its neighbour Ethiopia describing accusations that its troops were on Ethiopian territory as \"false\".On Saturday, a letter sent from Ethiopia's foreign minister to his Eritrean counterpart demanded that the soldiers withdraw.It also accused Eritrea of \"outright aggression\" saying it was conducting joint manoeuvres with Ethiopian rebels in the north and supplying them with weapons. In its response Eritrea said this was part of a \"spiral of hostile campaigns against Eritrea for more than two years\".There has long been a history of tension between Ethiopia and Eritrea, which split off from its larger neighbour three decades ago, and there are fears of a renewed conflict.The countries fought a border war between 1998-2000 in which more than 100,000 people died. A peace deal was never fully implemented and relations only eased after Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who later won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts, travelled to the Eritrean capital, Asmara, in 2018.The two had been allies in Ethiopia's recent civil war when Eritrea supported its army against Tigrayan forces, but things have once again soured.\"Developments over the last few days indicate that the Government of Eritrea has chosen the path of further escalation,\" Ethiopia Foreign Minister Gedion Timothewos's letter alleged.\"The incursion of Eritrean troops further into Ethiopian territory in our north-eastern borders and the joint military manoeuvres being carried out by Eritrean forces with rebel groups in our north-western borders are not just provocations but acts of outright aggression.\"One of the points of tension is the call from landlocked Ethiopia for access to the sea, which Abiy has described as an existential matter. He said that losing a port as a result of Eritrean independence was a \"mistake\".In his letter, the foreign minister said that if Eritrea's soldiers withdraw then the two countries could start talks including over \"the issue of access to the sea through the port of Assab\".In its response, Eritrea's information ministry said the \"patently false and fabricated accusations... [were] astounding in its tone and substance, underlying motivation, and overarching objective.\"As underlined before, the Government of Eritrea has no appetite for, or desire to, engage in meaningless acrimony to add fuel and exacerbate the situation.\"Last week, in a further sign of deteriorating relations, Abiy said for the first time that during to the 2020-2022 civil war in Tigray Eritrean troops had massacred people in the Ethiopian city Aksum. These were allegations Eritrea had previously denied following reports of mass killings that took place in the historic city in November 2020.In shifting alliances, Ethiopia now says that Eritrea is supporting rebels in Tigray who oppose the peace deal that ended the civil war. Eritrea denied the allegation and accused Ethiopia of \"floating false flags to justify the war that it has been itching to unleash for two long years\".More about Ethiopia from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "1 day agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent, BangkokandThanyarat Doksone,BangkokThailand election explained as voters head to the pollsPrime Minister Anutin Charnavirakul has claimed victory in Thailand's general election, with preliminary vote counts putting his ruling conservatives well ahead of their rivals.Anutin said his success belonged to \"all Thais, no matter whether you voted for us or not\", after his party's expected result defied opinion polls that had placed the reformist People's Party ahead.With 90% of the votes counted, Anutin's Bhumjaithai party is projected to win 194 seats in Bangkok's 500-seat parliament, with the People's Party in second place on 116.People's Party leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut appeared to concede the election, saying he was ready to serve in opposition if Anutin could form a government.The election was called in December after the coalition led by Anutin collapsed after just three months.While no party is projected to gain an overall majority, Anutin is now almost certain to stay in office, with his Bhumjaithai likely to have more than double the number of seats it won in the last election in 2023.Elections in Thailand are often unpredictable, and so it proved this time. This shock result is a huge disappointment for the People's Party, which had expected to improve on its winning performance three years ago. But a widely expected \"orange wave\" of support for its young, idealistic candidates did not materialise.The party, which under a different name Move Forward won the election in 2023, but was blocked from taking power by the unelected senate, found itself pushed into second place this time by Anutin's pragmatic conservatives. The reformists will remain in opposition for now. The feared crisis that could have occurred had they won, and once again been barred from office, has been averted.ReutersPM Anutin celebrated at his party's Bangkok headquartersOpinion polls have frequently been wrong in Thailand, but there will be a lot of post-election analysis of how Anutin turned his once small, provincial Bhumjaithai - \"Thai Pride\"-  party into such a formidable electoral machine.Playing on patriotic sentiment after the two short border wars with Cambodia last year, Anutin's party became the standard-bearer for conservatives, promising to defend the status of traditional Thai institutions like the monarchy and military.He campaigned on hard-line nationalist sentiments and populist giveaways - but his victory was also down to his ability to win local power-brokers to his side, in an electoral system where 80% of seats were decided in individual constituencies on a first-past-the-post basis, with the remaining 20% allocated on the proportion of the vote won at a national level.He also broadened the appeal of his party by putting well-known technocrats with reputations for competence at the heart of his campaign.The People's Party did much better in the proportional votes, but appears to have lost some of the support it had in 2023, and was unable to overcome its lack of networks at a local level.The third main contender was the Shinawatra family and its Pheu Thai – \"For Thais\" – party, which is projected to win 86 seats, a huge drop from its 2023 result.In the past it dominated elections, with well-marketed populist policies. It formed a coalition administration after Move Forward was blocked in 2023, but had two of its prime ministers dismissed by the notoriously interventionist constitutional court. Its standing in Thailand was damaged by accusations it had mishandled the conflict with Cambodia, and by its patriarch, former PM Thaksin Shinawatra, being sent to jail last September.Getty ImagesPeople in Thailand voted in the election throughout SundayThe state of the economy was uppermost in many voters' minds, with household debt at record levels and growth far lower than in previous years.\"I want the economy to improve and I don't want big factories to relocate to our neighbouring countries,\" civil servant Phananya Bunthong told the BBC, a reference to Thailand falling behind Vietnam. The People's Party promised big changes, from curbing the power of the biggest businesses and military, to streamlining the extensive bureaucracy and modernising the education system.   In the eight years since the movement was founded its radical agenda has been popular  with younger Thais.\"I want change. I don't want things to be the same,\" 28-year-old Kittitat Daengkongkho told the BBC.But it is clear from the result that this time that agenda was less successful among older people and those in the provinces, than the simpler promises of financial assistance made by Anutin's party.Alongside the election, Thais also voted in a referendum on whether to reform the 2017 constitution, which was drafted under military rule in 2017. Critics of the charter believe it gives too much power to unelected institutions like the courts and senate, \"handcuffing\" the country's democracy.With over 90% of votes counted, preliminary tallies suggested around 65% had voted in favour.",

    "body": "Maxwell refuses to answer questions about Epstein in congressional hearing4 hours agoCaitlin WilsonandCai Pigliucci,at Capitol HillWatch: New footage of Ghislaine Maxwell in prison cell released by DOJGhislaine Maxwell, the convicted associate of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, refused to answer questions from the US House Oversight Committee on Monday. Maxwell appeared virtually for a closed-door deposition from the Texas prison where she is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking.Republican House Oversight Committee chairman James Comer said that \"as expected\", Maxwell pleaded the Fifth Amendment, invoking her right to remain silent. \"This is obviously very disappointing,\" he said. \"We had many questions to ask about the crimes she and Epstein committed, as well as questions about potential co-conspirators.\"Reuters\"We sincerely want to get to the truth for the American people, and justice for the survivors, that's what this investigation is about,\" Comer added. The Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution gives Americans the right to avoid self-incrimination by refusing to answer questions while under oath. Demcoratic Representative Melanie Stansbury told reporters after the hearing that Maxwell used the opportunity to \"campaign for clemency\".Comer said it was clear from speaking to Epstein survivors \"that Maxwell was was a very bad person\" who did not deserve any type of immunity. In a social media post earlier, Maxwell's lawyer David Oscar Markus said Maxwell was \"prepared to speak fully and honestly if granted clemency by President Trump\".\"Only she can provide the complete account. Some may not like what they hear, but the truth matters,\" he posted.US lawmakers react after Maxwell refuses to answer questionsIn a letter sent to the House Oversight Committee before Maxwell's appearance, a group of Epstein survivors urged lawmakers to be sceptical of any information provided by Maxwell.They criticised her for refusing to identify \"the many powerful men\" involved in Epstein's trafficking operation and her refusals to \"meaningfully cooperate\" with law enforcement, saying any \"special treatment\" or \"credibility afforded to her testimony\", would be catastrophic for survivors. The White House has previously said \"no leniency is being given or discussed\" in relation to Maxwell.Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in luring underage girls for Epstein, her former boyfriend, to exploit. Epstein died in prison in 2019. She is seeking a pardon from Trump and has been accused of lying to federal officials.In a letter addressed to Comer before the deposition, Democratic Representative Ro Khanna said he planned to ask Maxwell about a court document she filed last year saying there were \"four named co-conspirators\" and 25 others who were not indicted as part of the Epstein investigation. He also planned to ask about her and the deceased financier's \"social relationship\" with Donald Trump, and whether the US president ever discussed a potential pardon for Maxwell with her defence team.Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, with whom he says he severed contact decades ago, and has not been accused of any crimes by Epstein's victims.Khanna said Maxwell's decision to not answer questions from the Oversight Committee \"appears inconsistent with Ms Maxwell's prior conduct, as she did not invoke the Fifth Amendment when she previously met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to discuss substantially similar subject matter\".According to a justice department transcript of that meeting in July, Maxwell told Blanche - who previously worked as Trump's personal attorney - that she did not witness any inappropriate conduct by Donald Trump or former US President Bill Clinton and that a rumoured Epstein \"client list\" does not exist.Monday's deposition was originally scheduled for last August but was postponed by Comer after a request from Maxwell's lawyers to wait for a Supreme Court ruling related to her case.The testimony comes as the US Department of Justice has released millions of pages of new files from its investigation into the disgraced financier after a law compelling their unveiling was passed by Congress last year.Members of Congress will be allowed to view the un-redacted versions of the nearly three million pages in person at the Department of Justice starting on Monday, the BBC's US news partner CBS reported. \"I think it's great that the Department of Justice is letting members of Congress come in and look at all the un-redacted versions of the documents,\" Comer told reporters at the Capitol on Monday.A group of Epstein survivors on Sunday released a video calling for further transparency around redactions and certain unreleased files. Blanche has rejected any accusations of a cover-up, saying previously that the notion of a \"hidden tranche of information of men that we know about\" and that the justice department is choosing not to prosecute is not the case.

    "body": "3 hours agoFarzad SeifikaranBBC News PersianMamlekateVerified images showing weaponry used by security forces against protesters Warning: The following story contains graphic details of violence which some readers might find upsetting.A BBC News Persian analysis of hundreds of videos and photographs taken during recent protests in Iran confirms the security forces' use of a wide range of weaponry, including machine guns, snipier rifles and shotguns.Protesters were reportedly killed in many of the more than 200 cities where protests had been recorded. While the exact death toll remains unclear, the level of brutality and the deployment of lethal weaponry evidenced in pictures, witness accounts and reports by human rights groups and the media show thousands have been killed across the country.The crackdown on protests  - which began over the economy but rapidly escalated - employed a level of violence unprecedented in modern Iranian history.\"This is the largest mass killing in contemporary Iranian history and one of the largest in the world,\" Payam Akhavan, an Iranian Canadian former UN prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, in The Hague, told BBC News Persian.The Iranian government has blamed the killings on \"rioters and terrorists\".But BBC News Persian analysis shows security forces used a number of different weapons on protesters, including:machine gunssniper riflesassault riflesshotgunshandgunspellet-firing paintball gunstear gasmachetesknivesbatonslarge wooden clubsgreen laser sights and pointers (for blinding and targeting)Machine gunsVahid Online / Fars News AgencyBBC News Persian cross-referenced photographs of Tehran's Sadeghiyeh Square with those of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard CorpsFootage from cities such as Tehran, Isfahan, Yazdanshahr, and Shahsavar, verified by BBC News Persian, shows both heavy - such as the DShK - and medium - such as the PK - machine guns mounted on military pickup trucks.The security forces reportedly used these for crowd control and to impose a state of siege.The Vahid Online Telegram channel shared two photographs of a black pickup truck with a machine gun mounted in the back in Tehran's Sadeghiyeh Square on the night of 8 January.BBC News Persian cross-referenced these with photos, published by Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency, of a 2025 military parade, showing nearly identical Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) pickups equipped with the same weapon. Weapons expert Amael Kotlarski, of Janes defence-intelligence company, has identified it as the DShKM model, produced under licence in Iran.Iran InternationalA video of protests in Yazdanshahr shows the muzzle fire of a machine gun mounted on the back of a pickup truckA video of the 9 January protests in Yazdanshahr, published by the Iran International television network, clearly shows protesters coming under sustained machine-gun fire. The gun's massive muzzle fire is visible at the 46-second mark.A representative of Thames Valley Guns, a UK-based company specialising in the expert analysis of military firearms, also told BBC News Persian vehicles equipped with DShK machine guns could be seen in the videos of the protests.MamlekateIn one verified video, someone displays spent cartridge casings from a Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle and a 20mm automatic cannon round, saying security forces had fired them at protestersIn one verified video, someone displays two spent cartridge casings from a Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle and one large spent shell, explaining security forces had fired them at protesters in Tehran's Behesht Square.Thames Valley Guns confirmed the large black projectile was a 20mm automatic cannon round designed to be used against military hardware. And rifling marks on its driving band confirm it had been fired.\"Ammunition of this nature is intended to defeat structures, vehicles and hardened targets, including lightly armoured personnel carriers,\" the representative said.\"They are not engineered for use against personnel, though the consequences of such a strike on a human would be catastrophic.\"Sniper riflesObtained by BBC News PersianA video from the city of Mashhad, verified by BBC News Persian, shows figures in IRGC-style uniform, on a rooftop, with a Dragunov sniper rifleWitnesses have told BBC News Persian sniper rifles were widely used during the January protests and this is confirmed by the verified footage.One of the videos verified by BBC News Persian, of the 9 January protests in the north-eastern city of Mashhad, shows two figures in black tactical uniforms of the type worn by several branches of the security forces, including the IRGC, on a hotel rooftop. And one of them has a Dragunov sniper rifle (SVD) leaning against a wall next to him.In an interview with Iranian state television, a forensic expert confirmed snipers had killed protesters. On 8 January, a relative of Ebrahim Pourahmadian, from Saqqez, in the western province of Kurdistan, who was in Tehran, working as the caretaker of a building, told BBC News Persian a sniper had shot him in the head, right in front of his child. And photographs obtained by BBC News News Persian of Pourahmadian's body confirm a single precision gunshot wound, in the middle of his forehead.The Thames Valley Guns representative explained the profound psychological impact of a well positioned sniper. \"For untrained civilians, the effect is even more severe,\" the representative said. \"Most people have no understanding of how to respond to a distant, unseen threat — and the resulting fear certainly triggers mass panic.\"Assault riflesSpent cartridge casings from a Kalashnikov-type assault rifle were found on the streetsThe Kalashnikov assault rifle is the standard-issue weapon for all military and law-enforcement branches in Iran. And BBC News Persian has analysed numerous videos showing members of both the police and the IRGC using using AK-47 Kalashnikovs and the Iranian-produced KL variants.One, from the northern city of Amol, on 9 January, shows a security officer aiming and firing a Kalashnikov directly at protesters. And after analysing exclusive images obtained by BBC News Persian of spent casings recovered from the streets, Kotlarski confirmed they were 7.62x39mm rounds - the specific calibre for Kalashnikov-type rifles.ShotgunsVahid OnlineVerified footage from Abadan, western Iran, on 7 January, shows police officers with shotguns deployed on streets during protestsBBC News Persian's investigation confirms the extensive use of shotguns.Verified footage from the western city of Lordegan, on 1 January, and Abadan, also in the west, on 7 January, shows police officers with shotguns deployed on streets during protests. And Kotlarski identified several models, including the Iranian-made Maher shotgun in both standard and short-barrelled configurations.Obtained by BBC News PersianAn exclusive CT-scan image obtained by BBC News Persian shows a metal pellet embedded in a Mashad protester's right eyeball​​As we saw during the crackdown on the 2022 Woman, Life, Freedom protests, the widespread use of shotguns in January resulted in the killing of many protesters and left hundreds, if not thousands, more with permanent eye injuries.Between 9 and 10 January, about 1,000 patients needing emergency surgery for ruptured eyeballs caused by metal pellets arrived at a single eye hospital alone, its head, Dr Ghasem Fakhraei, told the semi-official Iranian Students' News Agency. And BBC News Persian has obtained CT scans and medical records of several wounded protesters from Mashhad, one of which clearly shows a metal pellet embedded in the eye tissue.HandgunsIn two videos from Kermanshah, on 8 January, plainclothes security forces agents are seen wielding at least two types of pistols, which, analysts suggest, resemble the Beretta Model 50 or CZ 75.MachetesVahid OnlineCCTV footage from Tehran shows a plainclothes security agent wielding a machete attacking a female protester, on 8 JanuaryNumerous protesters have told BBC News Persian they were attacked with knives and machetes. Photographs obtained by BBC News Persian of the bodies also reveal machete as well as bullet woundsCCTV footage from Tehran clearly shows plainclothes agents attacking protesters seeking refuge in a block of flats with machetes. Another video from the capital, on 8 January, shows a plainclothes officer hitting a female protester in the head with a machete. Several other security personnel in military uniforms are also visible.BatonsVideos and interviews carried out by BBC News Persianwith the survivors show people being beaten with batons. BBC News Persian verified that one protester, Saghar Seifollahi Fars, was killed in this way and another, Ali Taherkhani, who was first shot, died not because of bullet wounds but from being beaten afterwards by batons and gun butts.",

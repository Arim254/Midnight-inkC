    "body": "9 hours agoAdam Easton,Warsaw correspondent and Jaroslav LukivTwo Ukrainian citizens who long worked for Russian intelligence have been identified as the suspects behind two acts of sabotage on Poland's rail network, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said.One suspect had already been convicted in absentia of acts of sabotage in Ukraine, Tusk told parliament.On Monday, he visited the scene of an explosion near Mika, south-east of Warsaw, which damaged the railway line leading to the Ukrainian border at the weekend, and called it an \"unprecedented act of sabotage\".Another incident down the line near Pulawy on Monday forced a packed train to stop suddenly and damage was found to overhead cables.The Kremlin brushed off suggestions of Russian involvement.Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said: \"It would have been really strange, if Russia hadn't been blamed first.\"\"Russia is accused of all acts of hybrid and direct war... in Poland,\" he told Russia's state-run media, adding: \"Russophobia is certainly rampant there.\"Polish authorities had initially said there was a very high chance that the two acts of sabotage on the Warsaw-Lublin railway line had been ordered by a \"foreign service\". Then a spokesman for Poland's special services minister said on Tuesday that \"everything points to them being Russian special services\".\"The goal was to cause a rail catastrophe,\" Tusk told MPs.The Polish prime minister said he would not disclose the names of the two suspects as this could complicate the operation, though he told parliament that one was living in Belarus and the other was a resident of eastern Ukraine.Both suspects had crossed into Poland from Belarus during the autumn and had now returned there via the border crossing at Terespol in the far south-west of Belarus, close to the Ukrainian border, he added.Tusk said that a military-grade C4 explosive device had been detonated on 15 November at about 21:00 (20:00 GMT) near the village of Mika.The explosion, which happened as a freight train was passing, caused minor damage to a wagon floor. It was captured on CCTV.Tusk said the train driver had not even noticed the incident.A previous attempt to derail a train by placing a steel clamp on the rail had failed, he added.The second act of sabotage, on 17 November, involved a train carrying 475 passengers having to suddenly brake because of damaged railway infrastructure, said Tusk.The prime minister also said he would issue an order later on Tuesday to raise the alert level on certain railway lines.He said since the start of last year 55 people had been detained on suspicion of assisting, preparing, or committing acts of sabotage and that 23 of them had been remanded in custody.Russia's motivation, Tusk went on, was to sow panic and stir up anti-Ukrainian sentiment in Polish society, which is home to more than one million Ukrainian war refugees.\"I want to emphasise that what the Russian authorities care about is not only the direct effect of this type of action, but also the social and political consequences of the fact that this action is taking place,\" he said.\"This of course means disorganisation, chaos, panic, speculation and uncertainty.\"Poland is both a Nato and EU member state, and its railway network has become vital for moving supplies of aid into Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.In September, Tusk said three Russian drones had been shot down by Polish and other Nato aircraft in Poland's airspace during overnight attacks on Ukraine.He said at the time that authorities had recorded 19 drone incursions, with some flying deep enough to temporarily close four airports, including Warsaw's main hub Chopin.Russia's defence ministry responded by saying there had been \"no plans\" to target facilities on Polish soil.",

    "body": "Superstar footballer Cristiano Ronaldo is to visit the White House on Tuesday, a US official has confirmed - the same day as the leader of Saudi Arabia where the Portuguese currently plays the game.The White House official did not say Ronaldo was part of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's official delegation.However his starring role in the Saudi football league has seen him become a face of the country's modernisation drive under the crown prince, the country's de-facto ruler, who wants to reduce the country's dependence on oil revenues by diversifying into other areas including sports and tourism.The footballer is not believed to have been to the US since 2016.In the interim he has faced an allegation of sexual assault. Kathryn Mayorga alleged that Ronaldo raped her in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009, which he denied.\"I firmly deny the accusations being issued against me. Rape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in,\" he said in a statement in 2018.In 2019, US prosecutors said Ronaldo would not face charges because the claims could not be proven. In early 2023, Ronaldo made the jump to Saudi Arabia when he became the face of the Saudi Pro League and captain of Al Nassr - the football club owned by sovereign wealth fund PIF which is chaired by the crown prince.In an industry where players are paid extraordinary amounts of money, Ronaldo's pay deal with Saudi Arabia was astronomical. The footballer was reportedly paid $200m (£152m) a year - or more than half a million dollars a day. Then in June this year, he signed a new two-year deal for a reported total of $400m (£300m) and became football's first billionaire player, according to Bloomberg, with a net worth of $1.4bn.That's a lot of money for a 40-year-old footballer in the twilight of his career.But, according to Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House, Saudi Arabia has \"invested heavily in high profile events and individuals to put the kingdom on the map\" in terms of sports and tourism in its quest for modernism.Ronaldo has referred to Prince Mohammed as \"our boss\" in an interview with broadcaster Piers Morgan.Earlier this month, he appeared at a Ministry of Tourism event in Riyadh where he talked up the kingdom's development projects and his hopes for the 2034 FIFA World Cup being held in Saudi Arabia.As for meeting Trump, Vakil says: \"The US president likes shiny things and Ronaldo is a shiny thing.\" Though the footballer has loftier ambitions for the meeting in Washington - world peace. In July, European Council president Antonio Costa handed Trump a Portugal jersey signed by Ronaldo which read: \"To president Donald J. Trump, Playing for Peace.\"He told Morgan: \"I hope to sit down with him someday because he's one of those people I really like.\"I think he can make things happen and I respect people like that.\"President Trump has already hosted the Saudi crown prince in the Oval Office and their next encounter is at a lavish black tie gala dinner in the East Room of the White House - which Ronaldo appears set to attend.The White House has so far been quiet about the guest list, but it will reportedly also include chief executives of prominent US companies, many of whom have business ties with Saudi Arabia.",

    "body": "US special envoy Steve Witkoff is set to join talks with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara on Wednesday, as the Ukrainian president said he wanted to \"intensify\" peace negotiations.\"Bringing the end of the war closer with all our might is Ukraine's top priority,\" Zelensky said, adding that efforts would also focus on resuming prisoner exchanges.Turkey has maintained ties with both Kyiv and Moscow and has previously hosted talks between the two factions.But no Russian representative is set to join the meeting in Ankara, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. He added that while there were \"no concrete plans\" for Vladimir Putin to speak to either the Turkish side or to Witkoff, the Russian president was \"of course open to a conversation\".Ankara will be the fourth capital Zelensky visits in only a few days. In Athens he secured a gas deal, in Paris he signed an agreement to obtain up to 100 fighter jets and in Madrid he held talks on co-operation with Spanish arms manufacturers.The visits are part of Zelensky's mission to try to shore up European support for Ukraine while Russian attacks on the country intensify and Moscow's troops close in on the key city eastern city of Pokrovsk.Domestically, Zelensky is facing the most serious crisis in years. Several members of his closest circle are under investigation for co-organising a large-scale criminal scheme, and two ministers have resigned. The scandal threatens to widen still and some EU leaders – who in December will decide whether to unblock a €140bn (£121bn) loan for Kyiv based on frozen Russian state assets – have warned Zelensky needs to do more to tackle corruption. As the fourth anniversary of the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 inches closer, Moscow and Kyiv remain fundamentally opposed in their views of how to end the war.Earlier in November Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russia's conditions for a peace deal had not changed since Putin laid them out in 2024.At the time, the Russian president demanded that Kyiv renounce any ambition to join Nato, as well as full Ukrainian withdrawal from the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.Zelensky has repeatedly argued that withdrawing from Donetsk and Luhansk – together known as the Donbas – would leave the rest of the country vulnerable to future attacks.Following a long meeting with Putin in April, Witkoff appeared to suggest that a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv hinged on the status of the contested Ukrainian regions as well as Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014. This stance led to tensions with Zelensky, who accused him of \"disseminating Russian narratives\". Zelensky and Witkoff have not met since early September. Although the summer saw a flurry of high-level talks and meetings - including between Trump and Putin - American efforts to bring a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine closer have stalled.At one point, it appeared Trump and Putin were about to meet again in Budapest –but that summit was scrapped, apparently after the US side became aware that Moscow had no intention of budging from several demands that were unacceptable to Kyiv.But contact between US and Russian officials has continued, albeit under the radar. Putin's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev was reportedly in Washington for meetings with Witkoff in late October, only days after Trump imposed sanctions on Russia's two biggest oil companies.",

    "body": "4 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseWatch: Trump says Saudi crown prince \"knew nothing\" about Jamal Khashoggi's murderUS President Donald Trump said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \"knew nothing\" about the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as he welcomed the kingdom's de facto ruler to the White House.Trump's comments appeared to contradict a US intelligence assessment in 2021 which determined the crown prince had approved the operation that led to Khashoggi's death at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. The crown prince, who has denied any wrongdoing, said at the White House that Saudi Arabia \"did all the right things\" to investigate Khashoggi's death, which he called \"painful\".It was his first US visit since the assassination, which sent shockwaves through the US-Saudi relationship. In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump shot back at a reporter who asked a question about the killing. \"You're mentioning someone that was extremely controversial,\" the US president said. \"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about. Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen.\" \"But he [the Crown Prince] knew nothing about it,\" Trump added. \"You don't have to embarrass our guests.\"The crown prince added that Saudi Arabia \"did all the right steps\" to investigate the murder, which he called \"painful\" and a \"huge mistake\". A US intelligence report made public in 2021 - under President Joe Biden's administration - determined that the crown prince had approved of a plan to \"capture or kill\" Khashoggi in Istanbul. During his first administration, Trump White House officials declined to release the report. While dozens of Saudi officials faced sanctions in the wake of the assassination, none directly targeted the crown prince.At the time, Saudi Arabia rejected the report as \"negative, false and unacceptable\". On Tuesday, Khashoggi's widow called on the crown prince to apologise for her husband's murder, for which she said there was \"no justification\".\"The Crown Prince said he was sorry so he should meet me, apologize and compensate me for the murder of my husband @JKhashoggi,\" Hanan Elatr Khashoggi posted on X. Granted political asylum in the US, she lives in the Washington DC area.Tuesday's meeting between Trump and Mohammed bin Salman was expected to include deals on civilian nuclear power, artificial intelligence and Saudi investment in the US, which the crown prince said was being upped to $1tr (£761bn) from $600bn pledged earlier this year. Echoing Trump's own words, bin Salman said that the US was the \"hottest country on the planet\" and praised the US president for creating \"long-term opportunity\". The two men also discussed the potential sale of advanced F-35 fighter aircraft to the Saudis. Trump said that while export licences were still being announced, he expected a deal between the Saudis and US defence giant Lockheed Martin. The potential sale has caused alarm among some Israeli officials, who have said that it could potentially hurt the country's \"qualitative military edge\" in the Middle East, where it is so far the only nation to have F-35s. The US president said the model sold to the Saudis would be broadly similar to the one the Israelis operate.\"This [Saudi Arabia] is a great ally, and Israel is a great ally,\" Trump said. \"I know they'd like you to get planes of reduced calibre.\"But as far as I'm concerned, I think they are both at a level where they should get top of the line,\" he added. The crown prince's visit to Washington continues with a gala dinner on Tuesday night, followed by an investment summit on Wednesday. Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo - who plays in the Saudi professional league - was also expected to be at the White House on Tuesday, a White House official confirmed to the BBC. Biden did not host the crown prince and vowed to make Saudi Arabia a \"pariah\" over its human rights record. In 2022, however, Biden visited the kingdom to reach agreement on other issues. ",

    "body": "The bodies of a 34-year-old woman and her daughter, 10, have been found inside freezers in an apartment in western Austria.The remains of the Syrian woman and child, who had been missing for several months, were discovered on Friday. The freezers were hidden behind a drywall partition in the flat, located in the city of Innsbruck.Two men, a 55-year-old Austrian and his 53-year-old brother, were arrested in June. The older man, a colleague of the Syrian woman, told police last week there had been an accident - but denied murder.Speaking to reporters earlier, Hansjörg Mayr, a spokesman for the public prosecutor's office, said the pair were being held on \"strong suspicion of murder\".The names of those involved have not been released by police, in accordance with Austrian law. The family's disappearance was first reported by the woman's cousin, who lives in Germany, on 25 July 2024. Police said the woman's colleague - the 55-year-old man - told them at the time she had gone on an extended trip with her child to visit her parents in Turkey.Her bank card was then found to have been used abroad several times. But when police searched the woman's home, her mobile phone was found.A witness also reported hearing a loud noise in the apartment, and cries of \"mama\", on the day the two were thought to have disappeared. A wider police investigation was launched, with officers discovering various messages sent from the woman's phone - including a resignation letter to her employer and messages to the male colleague. Authorities said a four-figure sum was also transferred to the man.Katja Tersch, head of the State Criminal Police Office in Tyrol, told reporters on Tuesday that a storage unit had been rented out before the victims' disappearance and a freezer had been placed there. The brothers removed the freezer from the unit on the day the woman and her child disappeared, Tersch said. And a week later, they acquired another freezer. Authorities say they believe this suggests the deaths were premeditated. \"The cause of death could not be determined due to the state of decomposition of the bodies,\" Tersch said.Mayr - of the public prosecutor's office - said the exact sequence of events is not yet known, but the bodies were professionally hidden and not discovered during a previous house search.While the brothers were arrested in June, it was not until 12 November that the 55-year-old admitted to an incident and to hiding the bodies. He denies any intent to kill, authorities said. Meanwhile, his younger brother admitted to a cover-up but denied knowledge of a homicide.The pair are currently in pre-trial detention in prisons in Innsbruck and Salzburg, around 117 miles (189km) apart.In a joint statement, Austria's Minister for Women Eva-Maria Holzleitner and Justice Minister Anna Sporrer said the \"alleged double murder... represents the sudden and brutal end of two human lives and exposes a cruel system\".\"Women and girls are being murdered due to the mere fact that they are women and girls,\" they continued.\"Femicides are a deeply rooted and society-wide problem that we must fight resolutely.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoSam Hancock and Hugo Bachega,Middle East correspondent  ReutersAt least 13 people have been killed in an Israeli strike near a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon, the country's health ministry says.The Israeli military said it had targeted members of the Palestinian armed group Hamas \"operating in a training compound... in the Ein el-Hilweh area\". It said the location was used by Hamas to plan and carry out attacks against Israel, which Hamas rejected as \"fabrication and lies\".Israel has carried out regular air strikes on people and places in Lebanon since a deal to end the conflict with the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah. Most strikes have targeted Hezbollah but Israel has also attacked Hamas in the country.As well as those killed, Lebanon's health ministry said at least four people had been injured in the strike.Images showed emergency workers at the entrance of Ein el-Hilweh, the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon.Footage online also showed ambulances rushing through the narrow streets of the crowded camp as a huge plume of smoke billowed from the location hit.Initial reports said the strike hit an area outside a mosque that is usually busy at night. Condemning the attack, Hamas said it had \"no military installations in the Palestinian camps in Lebanon\" and that the site targeted was an \"open sports field\".In its statement, the IDF said \"prior to the strike, measures were taken to reduce the chance of harm to civilians, including the use of precision munitions, aerial observations, and additional intelligence information\".Hamas attacked southern Israel from Gaza on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages. Israel's military response has killed at least 69,169 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated after the Lebanese group fired rockets at Israeli positions the day after 7 October 2023. Hezbollah said it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.Israel and Hezbollah fought an escalating conflict for 13 months that culminated in an intense Israeli bombing campaign and ground incursion into southern Lebanon in October 2024.Lebanese authorities said Israel's attacks killed about 4,000 people there - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israeli authorities said more than 80 of its soldiers and 47 of its civilians were killed in the hostilities.",

    "body": "Venezuela's Maduro 'ready to talk' as US ramps up pressure11 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterLatin America editor, BBC News Online'Face to face': Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro open to US talksVenezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro has said that he is willing to hold face-to-face talks with representatives of the Trump administration as US pressure on him grows.Maduro made the comment hours after US President Donald Trump said he had not ruled out deploying ground forces to the South American country.The Trump administration has accused Maduro - whose re-election last year was dismissed as rigged by many countries - of being the leader of a drugs cartel.Maduro has denied the allegation and accuses the US of trying to incite a war to gain control of Venezuela's oil reserves. Since Trump was sworn in to a second term in office in January, the US government has been increasing its pressure on Maduro.It has doubled the reward it offers for information leading to his capture to $50m (38m) and in August launched a counternarcotics operation targeting boats it accuses of transporting drugs from Venezuela to the US.More than 80 people have been killed in the US strikes on suspected vessels since, most of them in the Caribbean as well as some in the Pacific.According to US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, the aim of \"Operation Southern Spear\" is to remove \"narcoterrorists\" from the Western Hemisphere.But legal experts have questioned the legality of the strikes, pointing out that the US has provided no evidence that the boats were carrying drugs. It is also unclear how much of an impact the strikes are having on the wider flow of drugs, a significant portion of which cross the land border between Mexico and the US.The size of the US military deployment - which includes the US Navy's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford - has also led to speculation both in Venezuela and in the US that its real aim is to remove Maduro from power.Trump has been repeatedly asked by journalists about his government's plan and has given seemingly contradictory answers. Asked by US broadcaster CBS on 3 November whether the US was going to war with Venezuela, Trump said, \"I don't think so\".But on Sunday, when asked whether he would rule out US troops on the ground in Venezuela, he answered: \"No, I don't rule out that, I don't rule out anything.\"However, when pressed on whether he would speak to his Venezuelan counterpart directly, he said: \"I would probably talk to him, yeah.\"  \"I talk to everybody,\" Trump added. Also on Sunday, the US state department said it \"intended to designate Cartel de los Soles\", the Venezuelan drug trafficking gang it alleges is led by Maduro, as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO).But rather than doing so immediately, the state department said the move would become effective on 24 November. This delay - combined with Trump leaving the door open to direct talks - has been interpreted by some as a US ultimatum for Maduro: enter into negotiations or face even more draconian US measures.Being labelled as an FTO means it becomes illegal for US citizens to knowingly provide material support or resources to the group in question. According to the White House, it also then becomes the policy of the US to \"ensure the total elimination of these organisations' presence in the United States and their ability to threaten the territory, safety, and security of the United States\".Some analysts think that just as the Trump administration has argued that it is legal to target alleged drug boats in the Caribbean because of the danger they say they pose to US citizens, it could use the FTO designation to bolster support for strikes against the Cartel de los Soles on Venezuelan soil.In several of his recent public appearances, Maduro has addressed the US people directly, even speaking - and once even singing - in English. On Monday, he said \"dialogue, call, yes, peace, yes, war, no, never, never war\" and stressed that he was ready to talk \"face to face\" with anyone in the US \"who wants to talk to Venezuela\".Past attempts by various parties at negotiating with representatives of the Maduro government have failed. Talks between the Venezuelan opposition and the Maduro government mediated by Norway and held in Barbados broke down as did an earlier Vatican-backed effort at finding a way out of Venezuela's political crisis. While the US has been ratcheting up the pressure on Maduro, Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize Winner María Corina Machado has been trying to encourage the Venezuelan military to switch sides and turn on Maduro.Speaking and posting from an undisclosed location in Venezuela, where she has been hiding to escape arrest, Machado has long denounced the Maduro government as \"a criminal structure\" and called on Venezuelans to unite to depose it. On Tuesday, she uploaded what she called a \"freedom manifesto\" to social media in which she outlined her vision for a post-Maduro Venezuela. In it she states that \"we stand at the edge of a new era - one where our natural rights will prevail\" and argues that Maduro and his close allies need to be held accountable for \"crimes against humanity\", citing the mistreatment of political prisoners and detainees under his rule.

    "body": "What does Trump want with boat strike campaign?1 day agoBernd Debusmann Jr,at the White House and Joshua Cheetham,BBC VerifyUS Southern CommandThe US military posted a video Sunday showing a strike on an alleged drug boat in the eastern PacificUS airstrikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific have continued unabated since early September - a deadly campaign now dubbed Operation Southern Spear. Tens of thousands of troops and substantial air and naval assets have been deployed to the region, collectively forming the largest US military presence in and around Latin America in decades. On Sunday the US military confirmed the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, had arrived in the Caribbean. The Trump administration argues the strikes are necessary to stem the flow of drugs to the US. They have, however, been controversial and sparked fears of a wider conflict in the region. Why is the US conducting strikes?President Trump and members of his administration have justified the strikes as a necessary counter-drug measure to stem the flow of narcotics from Latin America to US streets. In a statement, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said that the campaign - which on 13 November was officially named Operation Southern Spear - is aimed at removing \"narco-terrorists from our hemisphere\" and securing the US from \"the drugs that are killing our people\".But little information about the targets or what drug trafficking organisations they allegedly belonged to has been officially released by the Pentagon. In at least a few cases, Hegseth and several other officials have claimed that the targets were tied to Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang designated as a foreign terrorist organisation by the Trump administration at the start of the year. It is unclear how much of an impact US officials believe that the strikes are having on the wider flow of drugs, a significant portion of which cross the land border between Mexico and the US. Where are US military units?The US has deployed substantial strike power in the Caribbean and western Atlantic within striking distance of Venezuela.BBC Verify has identified 15 warships in the region based on ship-tracking data, satellite imagery and announcements by US authorities.This includes the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, described by the US Navy as \"the most capable, adaptable, and lethal combat platform in the world\".The deployment also includes a range of guided-missile destroyers and amphibious assault ships capable of landing thousands of troops. Additionally, US combat aircraft have been deployed to bases in Puerto Rico, and US long-range bombers have flown within striking distance of Venezuela's coastline. Trump has also acknowledged that he authorised the CIA to conduct covert action in Venezuela, although the scope of what that could mean remains highly classified.How many strikes have there been?Between 2 September and 16 November, US forces hit at least 22 vessels in 21 separate strikes in international waters, both in the Caribbean and in the eastern Pacific. The majority of these strikes have taken place off the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia. US Southern Command announced on Sunday that its latest strike, conducted on Saturday in eastern Pacific international waters, killed three \"male narco-terrorists\" on board. \"Intelligence confirmed that the vessel was involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,\" Southern Command wrote in a post on X, alongside a video showing the boat exploding in a massive fireball. Collectively, at least 83 people have been killed. While US forces have not publicly identified them, they have all been alleged to be \"narco-terrorists\". One investigation, from the Associated Press, reported that several Venezuelan nationals killed in the strikes were low-level traffickers driven by poverty to a life of crime, as well as at least one local crime boss. Are these boat strikes legal? The Trump administration has insisted that the strikes are legal, justifying them as a necessary self-defence measure aimed at saving American lives.In a confidential note to Congress, the administration argued that the US is engaged in an armed conflict with drug cartels who are \"unlawful combatants\" and whose actions - drug trafficking - \"constitute an armed attack against the United States\".But some legal experts have said the strikes could be illegal and violate international law by targeting civilians, with no due process afforded to the suspects.Luis Moreno Ocampo, a former chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC), told the BBC that he believes that the strikes could be treated as crimes against humanity.Critics have also questioned whether the White House complied with US law in initially authorising the strikes.According to the US constitution, only Congress is able to declare war.In October, President Trump said the US is \"allowed\" to strike vessels near Venezuela, but that his administration \"may go back to Congress\" if the campaign was expanded to include targets on land.\"We don't have to do that,\" he said. \"But I think...I'd like to do that.\"Is the US preparing to attack Venezuela?The build-up has prompted concerns that the US is preparing to directly target Venezuela, or potentially to try to topple the left-wing socialist government of President Nicolás Maduro. On 3 November, Trump downplayed the possibility of a war with Venezuela, but suggested that he believed Maduro's days as the country's president were numbered. Asked if the US was going to war against Venezuela, the US president told CBS' 60 Minutes: \"I doubt it.\" \"I don't think so,\" he added. \"But they've been treating us very badly.\" How has Maduro responded? The Maduro government has accused the US of stoking tensions in the region, with the aim of toppling the government. In response, the Venezuelan military have announced readiness exercises and in November declared a \"massive mobilisation\" of troops, which saw 200,000 personnel sent across the country. Maduro has cautioned against the US becoming involved in Venezuela, and called for peace. \"No more forever wars. No more unjust wars. No more Libya. No more Afghanistan,\" Maduro said on CNN on 13 November. \"Long live peace.\"Additional reporting by Tom Edgington",

    "body": "2 days agoAnbarasan Ethirajan and Tessa WongBBC NewsGetty ImagesMs Hasina oversaw a transformation in Bangladesh's economy but critics say she crushed dissentBangladesh's longest-serving prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed began her political career as a pro-democracy icon, but fled mass protests against her rule in August 2024 after 15 years in power.Since then, Hasina has been in self-imposed exile in India, where she flew after being deposed by the student-led uprising which spiralled into nationwide unrest. On 17 November, a special tribunal in Dhaka sentenced her to death after convicting her of crimes against humanity. It was found Hasina had ordered a deadly crackdown on protesters between 15 July and 5 August 2024. She denied all charges against her.Up to 1,400 people were killed during the weeks of protests leading up to her ousting, most by gunfire from security forces, UN human rights investigators said. Their report found that she and her government had tried to cling to power using systematic, deadly violence against protesters. It was the worst bloodshed the country had seen since independence in 1971.The protests brought an unexpected end to the reign of Hasina, who had ruled Bangladesh for more than 20 years. She and her Awami League party were credited with overseeing the South Asian country's economic progress. But in recent years she was accused of turning autocratic and clamping down on any opposition to her rule. Politically motivated arrests, disappearances, extra-judicial killings and other abuses all rose under her rule. An order to 'use lethal weapons'In January 2024, Hasina won an unprecedented fourth term as prime minister in an election widely decried by critics as being a sham and boycotted by the main opposition. Protests began later that year with a demand to abolish quotas in civil service jobs. By summer they had morphed into a wider anti-government movement as she used the police to violently crack down on protesters.Amid increasing calls for her to resign, Hasina remained defiant and condemned the agitators as “terrorists”. She also threw hundreds of people into jail and brought criminal charges against hundreds more. A leaked audio clip suggested she had ordered security forces to \"use lethal weapons\" against protesters. She denies ever issuing an order to fire on unarmed civilians. Some of the bloodiest scenes occurred on 5 August, the day Hasina fled by helicopter before crowds stormed her residence in Dhaka. Police killed at least 52 people that day in a busy neighbourhood, making it one of the worst cases of police violence in the country's history.Hasina, who has been tried in absentia, called the tribunal a \"farce\". \"It is a kangaroo court controlled by my political opponents to deliver a pre-ordained guilty verdict... and to distract the world's attention from the chaos, violence and misrule of [the new] government,\" she told the BBC in the week before her verdict. She called for the ban on her party to be lifted before elections due in February.Hasina is also charged with crimes against humanity relating to forced disappearances during the Awami League's rule in another case at the same tribunal in Bangladesh. Hasina and the Awami League deny all the charges.Hasina and other senior members of her former government are also facing trial for corruption in a separate court - charges they deny.How did Sheikh Hasina come to power?Born to a Muslim family in East Bengal in 1947, Hasina had politics in her blood.Her father was the nationalist leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's \"Father of the Nation\" who led the country's independence from Pakistan in 1971 and became its first president. At that time, Hasina had already established a reputation as a student leader at Dhaka University.Her father was assassinated with most of his family members in a military coup in 1975. Only Hasina and her younger sister survived as they were travelling abroad at the time.After living in exile in India, Hasina returned to Bangladesh in 1981 and became the leader of the Awami League, the political party her father belonged to.She joined hands with other political parties to hold pro-democracy street protests during the military rule of General Hussain Muhammed Ershad. Propelled by the popular uprising, Hasina quickly became a national icon.Getty ImagesPropelled by the pro-democracy movement in the 1980s and early 1990s, Hasina became a national iconShe was first elected to power in 1996. She earned credit for signing a water-sharing deal with India and a peace deal with tribal insurgents in the south-east of the country.But at the same time, her government was criticised for numerous allegedly corrupt business deals and for being too subservient to India.She later lost to her former ally-turned-nemesis, Begum Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, in 2001.As heirs to political dynasties, both women have dominated Bangladesh politics for more than three decades and used to be known as the \"battling begums\". Begum refers to a Muslim woman of high rank.Observers say their bitter rivalry resulted in bus bombs, disappearances and extrajudicial killings becoming regular occurrences.Hasina eventually came back to power in 2009 in polls held under a caretaker government.A true political survivor, she endured numerous arrests while in opposition as well as several assassination attempts, including one in 2004 that damaged her hearing. She has also survived efforts to force her into exile and numerous court cases in which she has been accused of corruption.Achievements and controversiesOnce one of the world's poorest nations, Bangladesh achieved credible economic success under her leadership from 2009.Its per capita income tripled in the last decade and the World Bank estimates that more than 25 million people have been lifted out of poverty in the last 20 years.Much of this growth has been fuelled by the garment industry, which accounts for the vast majority of total exports from Bangladesh and has expanded rapidly in recent decades, supplying markets in Europe, North America and Asia.Using the country's own funds, loans and development assistance, Hasina's government also undertook huge infrastructure projects, including the flagship $2.9bn Padma bridge across the Ganges. But Hasina has long been accused of enacting repressive authoritarian measures against her political opponents, detractors and the media - a remarkable turnaround for a leader who once fought for multi-party democracy. Rights groups estimate there have been at least 700 cases of enforced disappearances, with hundreds more subject to extra-judicial killings, since Hasina took power again in 2009. Hasina denies involvement in these.Bangladesh's security forces have also been accused of serious abuses. In 2021, the US sanctioned its Rapid Action Battalion - a notorious police unit accused of carrying out numerous extra-judicial killings - citing human rights violations.Human rights activists and journalists also faced increasing attacks including arrests, surveillance and harassment. Hasina's government was also accused of \"judicially harassing\" targets with court cases, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus - who became head of the interim government after Hasina fled. He had been jailed earlier in 2024 and faced more than 100 charges, in cases his supporters say were politically motivated.Hasina's government flatly denied claims of such abuses, while also restricting visits when it was in power by foreign journalists seeking to investigate the allegations. The protests against civil service quotas, which sparked last year's uprising, came as Bangladesh struggled with the escalating costs of living in the wake of the pandemic. Inflation skyrocketed, the country's foreign exchange reserves dropped precipitously, and its foreign debt doubled since 2016.Critics blamed this on mismanagement by Hasina's government, claiming that Bangladesh's economic progress only helped those close to her.Getty ImagesBangladeshis wave the national flag on 5 August, 2025 as they celebrate one year since Sheikh Hasina was ousted from power",

    "body": "1 day agoCelia HattonGetty ImagesSince 2018, the United States has been tightening its laws to prevent its rivals from buying into its sensitive sectors – blocking investments in everything from semiconductors to telecommunications.But the rules weren't always so strict.In 2016, Jeff Stein, a veteran journalist covering the US intelligence community, got a tip-off: a small insurance company that specialised in selling liability insurance to FBI and CIA agents had been sold to a Chinese entity.\"Someone with direct knowledge called me up and said, 'Do you know that the insurance company that insures intelligence personnel is owned by the Chinese?'\" he remembers. \"I was astonished!\"In 2015, the insurer, Wright USA, had been quietly purchased by Fosun Group, a private company believed to have very close connections with China's leadership.US concerns became immediately clear: Wright USA was privy to the personal details of many of America's top secret service agents and intelligence officials. No one in the US knew who might have access to that information now the insurer and its parent, Ironshore, were Chinese-owned.Wright USA wasn't an isolated case. The BBC has exclusive early access to new data that shows how Chinese state money has been flowing into wealthy countries, buying up assets in the US, Europe, the Middle East and Australia.Jeff Stein's story brought a swift reaction in WashingtonIn the past couple of decades China has become the world's biggest overseas investor, giving it the potential to dominate sensitive industries, secrets and key technologies. Beijing considers the details of its foreign spending overseas – how much money it's spending and where - to be a state secret.But on the terms of the Wright USA sale, Stein says: \"There was nothing illegal about it; it was in the open, so to speak. But because everything's intertwined so closely in Beijing, you're essentially giving that [information] up to Chinese intelligence.\"The Chinese government was involved in the deal: fresh data seen by the BBC reveals that four Chinese state banks had provided a $1.2bn (£912m) loan, routed through the Cayman Islands, to allow Fosun to buy Wright USA.Stein's story ran in Newsweek magazine. And there was a swift reaction in Washington: triggering an inquiry by the branch of the US Treasury that screens investments, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Shortly after, the company was sold again - back to Americans. It's unclear who ordered that sale.Fosun and Starr Wright USA, the company that now owns Wright USA, did not respond to a BBC request for comment.High-level US intelligence sources confirm the Wright USA sale was one of the cases that led the first Trump administration to tighten its investment laws in 2018.Very few could have understood at the time that this Chinese state-backed spending appears to have been part of a much bigger strategy carried out by Beijing to invest and buy assets in every continent.\"For many years, we assumed that virtually all of China's money flows were going to developing countries,\" says Brad Parks, executive director of AidData. \"And so, it came as a great surprise to us when we realised that actually there were hundreds of billions of dollars going into places like the US, the UK and Germany, happening right underneath our noses.\"AidData is a research lab based in Virginia that specialises in tracking how governments spend their money outside their borders.  It's based at William & Mary, one of America's oldest universities and it gets its funding from governments and charitable organisations around the world. For the past 12 years, AidData has had a major focus on China.A four-year effort involving 120 researchers has led to the first known effort to tally all of China's state-backed investments around the world. The group's entire dataset is available open source although the BBC was given exclusive advance access.AidData's key discovery: since 2000, Beijing has spent $2.1 trillion outside its borders, with a roughly equal split between developing and wealthy countries.Getty ImagesMore than 70% of the container shipping terminals at Rotterdam, the largest seaport in Europe, are Chinese-owned  \"China has a kind of financial system that the world has never seen,\" says Victor Shih, director of the 21st Century China Centre at University of California San Diego. China has the largest banking system in the world – larger than the US, Europe and Japan put together, he adds. That size, along with the amount of control Beijing exerts over state banks, gives it unique capabilities.\"The government controls interest rates and directs where the credit goes,\" Mr Shih says. \"This is only possible with very strict capital control, which no other country could have on a sustainable basis.\"Some of the investments in wealthy economies appear to have been made in order to generate a healthy return. Others fall in line with Beijing's strategic objectives, set out a decade ago in a major government initiative called Made in China 2025.In it the Chinese authorities outlined a clear plan to dominate 10 cutting-edge industries, like robotics, electric vehicles and semiconductors by this year. Beijing wanted to fund big investments abroad so key technologies could be brought back to China.Global alarm at the plan led China to drop public mention of it, but Victor Shih says it \"stayed very much alive\" as a guiding strategy.\"There are all kinds of plans still being published,\" he says, \"including an artificial intelligence plan and a smart manufacturing plan. However, the mother of all plans is the 15th five-year plan.\"At a key meeting of the Communist Party last month, China's leaders  set the goal of accelerating \"high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-improvement\" until 2030.AidData's new database highlights state-backed spending overseas that matches the 10 sectors targeted in 2015. The BBC's earlier reporting detailed how the Chinese government bankrolled the purchase of a UK semiconductor company.The United States, the UK and many other major economies have tightened their investment screening mechanisms after each country appears to have been caught off-guard by deals like the sale of the insurer, Wright USA.AidData's Brad Parks says wealthy governments didn't realise at first that Chinese investments in each country were part of Beijing's larger strategy.\"At first blush, they thought it was just a lot of individual initiative from Chinese companies,\" he says. \"I think what they've learned over time is that actually Beijing's party state is behind the scenes writing the cheques to make this happen.\"However, it must be underlined that such investments and purchases are legal, even if they are sometimes obscured within shell companies or routed through offshore accounts.\"The Chinese government has always required Chinese enterprises operating overseas to strictly comply with local laws and regulations, and has consistently supported them in conducting international co-operation based on mutual benefit,\" the Chinese embassy in London told the BBC.\"Chinese companies not only provide quality products and services to people around the world, but also contribute actively to local economic growth, social development and job creation.\"China's spending patterns are changing, the AidData database shows, with Beijing's state money flowing to countries that have decided to welcome Chinese investment.In the Netherlands there's been debate around Nexperia, a troubled Chinese-owned semiconductor company.It shows up in the AidData database too – Chinese state banks loaned $800m to help a Chinese consortium acquire Nexperia in 2017. Two years later, the ownership passed to another Chinese company - Wingtech.Nexperia's strategic value was highlighted when the Dutch authorities took control of the company's operations in September -  in part, the Dutch government said, over concerns that Nexperia's technology was at risk of being transferred to other parts of the larger Wingtech company.That bold move had resulted in Nexperia effectively being cut into two – separating Dutch operations from its Chinese manufacturing.Nexperia confirmed to the BBC that its Chinese business had stopped operating within Nexperia's governance framework and was ignoring instructions. The company said it welcomed China's commitment to resuming exports of its critical chips to global markets.Xiaoxue Martin, a research fellow at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague, says many in the Netherlands were surprised at how the government handled the case, since they've always managed their relationship with China carefully in the past.\"We're a country that has always done very well with open trade, free trade. And this is really the merchant side of Dutch policy,\" she says. \"Only recently we found that actually, hold on - geopolitics makes it necessary to have more industrial policy, to have this investment screening, when in the past there wasn't that much attention for this.\"Xiaoxue Martin is clear – it's easy to go too far down the path of fearing what could happen as a result of doing so much business with a superpower like China.\"There's a danger of making it seem as if China is this monolith, that they all want the same thing, and that they're all out to get Europe, and to get the United States, when obviously that's not the case,\" she says. \"Most companies, especially if they're private, they just want to make money. They want to be treated as a normal company. They don't want to have this negative reception that they're getting in Europe.\"If China is so far ahead of its rivals in its plans to buy into sensitive sectors, does that mean the race to dominate these arenas is already over?\"No! There's gonna be multiple laps,\" maintains Brad Parks. \"There are many Chinese companies that are still trying to make these types of acquisitions. The difference is, now they're facing higher levels of scrutiny to vet these inbound sources of foreign capital.\"So China makes its move. China is not the follower any more, it is the leader. It is the pace setter. But what I'm anticipating is that many G7 countries are going to move from the back foot to the front foot. \"They're going to move from defence to offence.\"",

    "body": "A Lebanese man has gone on trial in Celle, northern Germany, accused of being a member of Hezbollah - a Shia Muslim group whose military wing is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the EU.The 35 year-old man, named only as Fadel Z, in line with German privacy laws, is charged with having played a key role in procuring products for Hezbollah's drone programme.The German Federal Prosecutor's Office said Fadel Z joined Hezbollah more than 10 years ago, first working in public relations.In a statement, prosecutors said Fadel Z became a \"foreign operator\" for the group's drone programme in 2022, first from Barcelona in Spain. In the summer of 2023, he started working from Germany.According to the statement by prosecutors, Hezbollah has been running \"an extensive drone programme for some time\".Following Hamas's 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, prosecutors said Hezbollah had \"systematically fired rockets and explosive-laden drones at both military and civilian targets in Israel\".\"By June 2024, it had built up an arsenal of over 10,000 [drone] units.\"To procure such drones \"the organisation employs foreign operatives who covertly purchase components in Europe and export them to Lebanon\", prosecutors said.Fadel Z is accused of purchasing materials and products for drone construction worth around €1.4m (£1.2m), until he was arrested in July 2024.The products came from companies in Europe, China and the US.According to prosecutors, these included more than 2,000 petrol and electric motors, and over 600 propellers.Fadel Z is said to have often used front companies registered in his own name or that of his contacts to place orders. Suppliers were also paid via these companies.Prosecutors say he also arranged for the goods to be transported to Lebanon - where the group is based - either by container ship from ports in Hamburg or Spain or by air freight.Two of the engines purchased by Fadel Z were used in explosive drones that Hezbollah fired at Israel, they added.One of the drones was flown into a retirement home in the town of Herzliya, near Tel Aviv, on the night of 11 October 2024, the Jewish Holy Day of Yom Kippur.Although the explosive device detonated inside the building, none of the 200 or so residents was injured.The Federal Prosecutor's Office said it considered this to be aiding and abetting attempted murder.The trial at the regional court in Celle is expected to last until August next year.Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated after Hezbollah fired rockets at Israeli positions the day after Hamas's attacks on Israel in October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah fought an escalating conflict for 13 months. It culminated in an intense Israeli bombing campaign and ground incursion into southern Lebanon in October.Lebanese authorities said Israel's attacks killed about 4,000 people there - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israeli authorities said more than 80 of its soldiers and 47 of its civilians were killed in the hostilities.",

    "body": "From bicycles to cash: The rising cost of India's poll promises24 hours agoNikhil InamdarBBC News, MumbaiHindustan Times via Getty ImagesCash transfer announcements, especially directed towards women, have become popular ahead of electionsFreebies are powering election victories in India, but can its states afford them? Over the years, handouts have taken different forms in the hotly contested political landscape of the world's largest democracy. Voters have been lured with everything from television sets to bicycles and sometimes even gold ornaments - blurring the fine line between welfare economics and pre-poll populism.In recent years, cash transfers, especially directed towards women, have become a popular election-winning strategy for political parties of all stripes.A sweeping victory last week in the eastern state of Bihar - India's poorest state - for an alliance led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is being credited in part to a 10,000 rupee ($112; £85.18) cash handout to the state's women. A record number of women turned out to vote in the election.Similar women-oriented financial support schemes were launched by Modi's party in other states like Maharashtra ahead of polls last year. Opposition parties have also promised similar schemes in some states ahead of elections.Economists like Jean Drèze have argued in favour of such giveaways. He says that while distinguishing between \"useful\" and \"wasteful\" handouts is important, it is only by extracting promises during elections that the poor in India get anything at all from their political representatives.On the other hand, despite his party's own track record on the issue, Modi has in the past warned of the dangers of \"revdi culture\" - likening election giveaways to the frivolous distribution of sweets. India's top court had also sought to curb the distribution of such \"irrational freebies\" during elections back in 2023.While there is broad agreement on the need for targeted subsidies to challenge the use of handouts as electoral bait, Indian elections are increasingly dominated by unaffordable, poll-driven freebie economics that states can ill afford.Hindustan Times via Getty ImagesModi (right) with incumbent Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar ahead of the electionAccording to research from brokerage Emkay Global, Bihar is facing considerable fiscal pressure, with the deficit or gap between what the state earns and spends at 6% of its gross domestic product (GDP).Despite this, the state announced pre-election schemes amounting to 4% of GDP, more than its capital outlay - money that could have been spent in job-creating, long-term assets that would have aided the state's development. It is just one example in a litany of states practising indiscriminate election populism, according to Emkay Global.\"Even good [fiscally prudent] states are now in the grip of freebie economics,\" the brokerage said, as a result of which the 3% fiscal deficit to GDP ceiling that has been mandated for states, to curb non-budgeted spending, is now actually the floor.Some estimates suggest that 21 of India's 29 states have crossed this 3% deficit target, with disproportionate costs imposed by election-driven spending being one of the reasons.The fact that such populism is unsustainable is illustrated by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led alliance's Ladki Bahin (Beloved Sister) financial assistance scheme, which led to a 0.4% jump in Maharashtra state's deficit, according to Emkay Global. It forced the government to roll back some of the promises once the polls were over.India's central bank has also flagged the rising burden of such subsidies on state-level debt as a key emerging concern.According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), while overall debt of Indian states declined to about 28.5% of GDP by March 2024 compared with the levels seen over the past decade, it remains well above the 20% recommended threshold, with new pressures emerging in the form of an increasing subsidy burden.\"An area of incipient stress is the sharp rise in expenditure on subsidies, driven by farm loan waivers, free/subsidised services (like electricity to agriculture and households, transport, gas cylinder) and cash transfers to farmers, youth and women,\" the RBI said in its 2024-25 report on state finances.\"States need to contain and rationalise their subsidy outgoes, so that such spending does not crowd out more productive expenditure.\"Hindustan Times via Getty ImagesState governments have distributed free cycles to female students in the pastThis warning comes as the private sector continues to hold back on investment in new job-creating factories, and the government, forced to slow its own capital spending on infrastructure, turns instead to tax cuts and giveaways to spur middle-class consumption.But with freebies seeing such success in Bihar - and more state elections looming - that warning is unlikely to be heeded.\"This [Bihar] election outcome reinforces the freebie wave that has swept states in the last two years, and with Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and crucially, West Bengal going to polls next year, one can expect this race to the bottom to continue,\" Emkay Global economists Medhavi Arora and Harshal Patel said in their note.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

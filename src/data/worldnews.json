The indictment was later dismissed at the direction of the Trump administration. </p></div><div><p>\"I cannot continue my re-election campaign,\" Adams said in a video posted on social media on Sunday. </p><p>\"The constant media speculation about my future and the campaign finance board's decision to withhold millions of dollars have undermined my ability to raise the funds needed for a serious campaign.\" </p><p>Adams has not endorsed any of his rivals in the race. But he did make comments in his withdrawal statement that appeared to be directed at Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee and front-runner in the race.</p><p>\"Major change is welcome and necessary, but beware of those who claim the answer to destroy the very system we built together over generations,\" he said without naming Mamdani, a self-described socialist. \"That is not change, that is chaos.\"</p><p>Adams warned that \"insidious forces\" were pushing \"divisive agendas\" in city politics. </p><p>Once seen as a rising star in New York politics, the former police officer's popularity waned due to corruption allegations, tensions with Democrats over immigration, and frustration with the city's rising cost of living.</p><p>In an indictment last September, Adams was alleged to have accepted gifts totalling more than $100,000 (£75,000) from Turkish citizens in exchange for favours. He denied any wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty. </p><p>In April, the justice department ordered federal prosecutors in New York to drop the charges. But the controversy continued to haunt Adams as he trailed in the re-election race.</p><p>His relationship with the Democrats deteriorated during the Biden administration as he criticised its immigration strategy. </p><p>Earlier this year, he said he would run as an independent - a move that spared him from the competitive Democratic primary, which was won by Mamdani.</p><p>Adams will serve out the remainder of his term, which ends on 1 January. His name will remain on the ballot because the deadline to change it has passed.</p></div>"

They are also at risk, with just 5,000 to 8,000 of them left.</p><p>This year marks the 20th anniversary of the hotly-contested race, which seeks to raise awareness of the country's many native species considered to be in danger.</p><p>Each one of the 73 birds in the running this year had a volunteer campaign manager, who sought to win over voters with memes, reels and hand-drawn posters.</p></div><div><p>\"Behind the memes and mayhem is a serious message. This year's top 10 manu matches the statistics exactly – 80% of them are in trouble,\" says Nicola Toki, chief executive of conservation group Forest & Bird, which organised the poll.</p><p>Ms Toki added that two of this year's contestants, the kākāpō and karure black robin, are \"nationally critical\", each with fewer than 300 birds remaining.</p><p>\"Habitat destruction, climate change and introduced predators continue to push many species towards extinction. But public awareness can be powerful,\" she said.</p><p>This year's contest saw a record number of more than 75,000 voters.</p><p>As part of the election campaign, the birds were also able to take part in an election debate, where their campaign managers made the case for why the public should vote for them. </p><p>As well as earning the annual title, the kārearea will become the subject of a new waiata [Māori language song] that will be released to the public. </p><p>The next highest votes went to the kea, which got 12,506 votes; and the kakaruia or black robin, which followed closely with 11,726 votes. The black robin came close to winning last year but was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckg00xp0442o\">beaten by a shy yellow-eyed penguin called the hoiho. </a></p><p>Also in the running was the kākāpō, the world's fattest parrot <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/54974607\">which has won Bird of the Year twice</a> and had to be removed from the contest in 2022 to give other birds a chance to win. </p><p>Other birds that did well in this year's competition and have never won before were the takahē, which was once thought to have been extinct before being brought back from the brink, and the enigmatic ruru or morepork - a type of small owl.</p></div><div><p>As well as voting for their favourite bird, nature lovers have also been able to take part this year in a version of the popular web-based word game Wordle - called, of course, Birdle. </p><p>The competition has gained international attention in recent years, following the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-67376814\">controversial campaign by comedian John Oliver</a> to get the endangered pūteketeke to win.</p><p>This included him dressing up as the bird on his talk show and the erection of billboards in countries including New Zealand, Japan, France and the UK. </p><p>There have also been allegations in the past of voter fraud and foreign interference, as well as outrage from some when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/59120252\">a bat was crowned the winner in 2021. </a></p><p>More than 70 species of bird were contestants this year, and ranged in conservation status from \"doing okay\" to \"in serious trouble\" due to a number of factors including predators and habitat loss. </p><p>New Zealand is not the only country holding a competition to celebrate its local birdlife.

Opinion polls had suggested up to 60% backed digital IDs, which also had the approval of the Swiss government, and both houses of parliament. </p><p>It was Switzerland's second vote on digital IDs. An earlier proposal was rejected in 2021, amid concerns the data would be held centrally, and controlled largely by private providers. </p></div><div><p>Sunday's revised proposal keeps the system in government hands.  Data will be stored only on the smartphones of individual users, and digital IDs will be optional. </p><p>Citizens can continue to use national identity card if they choose, which has been standard for decades in Switzerland.</p><p>To further ease privacy concerns, a particular authority seeking information on a person – such as proof of age or nationality, for example – will only be able to check for those specific details.</p><p>It comes after the UK government announced plans earlier this week to introduce its own digital ID - which would be mandatory for employment - as part of efforts to curb the number of illegal migrants living and working in the country.</p><p>The proposed British digital ID would have fewer intended uses than the Swiss version, but has still raised concerns about privacy and data security. </p><p>Supporters of the Swiss system say it will make life much easier for everyone, allowing a range of bureaucratic procedures - from getting a telephone contract to proving you are old enough to buy a bottle of wine - to happen quickly online.</p><p>Opponents of digital ID cards, who gathered enough signatures to force another referendum on the issue, argue that the measure could still undermine individual privacy.</p><p>They also fear that, despite the new restrictions on how data is collected and stored, it could still be used to track people and for marketing purposes.</p><p>Switzerland has a long tradition of protecting its citizens' privacy. The banking secrecy laws, now much diluted, were designed to shield an individual's personal finances from the prying eyes of the state.</p><p>For years, Google Street View was controversial in Switzerland - and even today, following a ruling by the Swiss Federal Court, images taken close to schools, women's refuges, hospitals or prisons must be automatically blurred before going online.</p></div>"

Matters ranging from criminal trials to property and family disputes have been pending here for decades, leaving thousands of people in India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, trapped in legal limbo.</p><p>Consider Babu Ram Rajput, 73, a retired government employee who has been battling a property dispute for over three decades. </p><p>He bought land at an auction in 1992, but the previous owner challenged the sale - and the case remains unresolved to this day.</p><p>\"I just hope my case is decided while I'm still alive,\" Mr Rajput says.</p><p>The high court's struggle mirrors a broader crisis in India's judiciary, where too few judges and a constant flood of cases have caused crippling delays.</p><p>With a sanctioned strength of 160 that experts say has never been completely filled, the court is severely understaffed. Delays in police investigations, frequent adjournments, and poor infrastructure further <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://indiajusticereport.org/files/IJR%204_Full%20Report_English_Low.pdf\">add to the backlog</a>, leaving the system stretched beyond capacity.</p><p>Each judge faces hundreds of cases a day - sometimes over 1,000. With just five working hours, that's less than a minute per case. In practice, many aren't heard at all. </p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d753/live/c3560050-99e1-11f0-ab25-c9c4c516f15a.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d753/live/c3560050-99e1-11f0-ab25-c9c4c516f15a.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d753/live/c3560050-99e1-11f0-ab25-c9c4c516f15a.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d753/live/c3560050-99e1-11f0-ab25-c9c4c516f15a.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d753/live/c3560050-99e1-11f0-ab25-c9c4c516f15a.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d753/live/c3560050-99e1-11f0-ab25-c9c4c516f15a.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d753/live/c3560050-99e1-11f0-ab25-c9c4c516f15a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d753/live/c3560050-99e1-11f0-ab25-c9c4c516f15a.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Umang Poddar/BBC Old and new files stacked in a room at the Allahabad high court \" /><span>Umang Poddar/BBC</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Over a million cases are pending at the Allahabad High Court</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Lawyers say urgent matters - like bail pleas or eviction stays - are heard first, pushing older cases further down the list.</p><p>Senior lawyer Syed Farman Naqvi says courts often issue interim or temporary orders in urgent cases - but once the immediate need is met, the matter lingers as new cases pile up.</p><p>Retired judge Amar Saran says the mounting backlog has forced judges into a \"cut-grass approach\" - issuing quick, standard orders, from nudging the government to act to directing lower courts to handle the matter.</p><p>In April, the court confronted the scale of its delays while ruling on a rape and murder case pending for over 40 years. By the verdict's delivery, four of the five convicted men had died. Ordering the sole surviving convict to surrender, the court admitted it regretted not ruling sooner.</p><p>The backlog has even prompted legal action. Earlier this year, a group of Allahabad High Court lawyers petitioned for more judicial appointments, calling the court \"paralysed\" by a shortage of judges that leaves cases lingering for years.</p><p>The crisis has caught the attention of India's top court. In January, the Supreme Court called it \"worrisome\" that case listings at the Allahabad High Court are unpredictable, saying the system had completely collapsed.</p><p>Uncertain hearing dates hit people hard, especially in vast Uttar Pradesh. Many travel hundreds of kilometres to Prayagraj where the court is located on just a few days' notice for their hearing.</p><p>Mr Rajput is from Kanpur, 200km (125 miles) from Prayagraj. He spends around four hours travelling each time his case is listed - yet can never be sure it will actually be heard.</p><p>\"I'm over 70,\" he says. \"I often learn just days in advance that my case is listed, \"making travel a hassle.\" He adds that many times his case isn't heard because other matters take up the whole day. </p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9275/live/15634d90-9a86-11f0-a64c-235ee04911fb.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9275/live/15634d90-9a86-11f0-a64c-235ee04911fb.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9275/live/15634d90-9a86-11f0-a64c-235ee04911fb.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9275/live/15634d90-9a86-11f0-a64c-235ee04911fb.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9275/live/15634d90-9a86-11f0-a64c-235ee04911fb.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9275/live/15634d90-9a86-11f0-a64c-235ee04911fb.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9275/live/15634d90-9a86-11f0-a64c-235ee04911fb.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9275/live/15634d90-9a86-11f0-a64c-235ee04911fb.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Umang Poddar/BBC A man binds case files outside the Allahabad high court \" /><span>Umang Poddar/BBC</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>A man preparing court files outside the Allahabad High Court</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Lawyers have long urged the court to set up another bench - a branch of the high court in a different city to ease access and speed up hearings - in the western part of the state. Currently, an additional bench exists in the city of Lucknow. A similar recommendation was made in 1985 by a government commission, but it has yet to be implemented.</p><p>Earlier this year, the state government reportedly <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/lawyers-attempt-to-establish-wup-hc-bench-fails-again-causing-gloom/articleshow/107196913.cms\">urged the high court</a> to set up another bench, but the letter was later withdrawn for unknown reasons. The push for more benches isn't limited to Uttar Pradesh; a 2009 Law Commission report said all states would benefit from additional high court branches.</p><p>While new benches could help long-term, experts say quicker fixes - like appointing more judges - are needed. </p><p>But the process is slow and complex: senior high court judges first shortlist candidates, then the list is reviewed by the state and federal governments, and the Chief Justice of India. After this, senior Supreme Court judges forward the final list to the federal government for appointment.</p><p>Experts say picking the right candidates is often challenging. Former Allahabad High Court Chief Justice Govind Mathur notes that chief justices, often appointed from outside the state, may not know local lawyers or judges, complicating recommendations. Names can be rejected at any stage and remain confidential until the Supreme Court forwards them to the government.</p><p>Last year, the Supreme Court <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cdnbbsr.s3waas.gov.in/s3ec0490f1f4972d133619a60c30f3559e/uploads/2025/05/2025051927.pdf\">recommended just one appointment </a>for the Allahabad High Court, despite nearly half the seats being vacant. Some progress came this year, after 40 new judges were added - 24 of whom were appointed last week - but the backlog persists.</p><p>Experts say the backlog is so huge that even at full strength, each judge would handle over 7,000 pending cases. </p><p>Mr Mathur says that deeper judicial reforms - like a \"uniform policy for hearing and disposing of cases\" - are essential, rather than leaving it to individual judges.</p></div></article>"

And so, it has announced that from next spring it will charge every visitor from outside the area €17.50 ($20.50; £15) to enter, to try to control the numbers.</p><p>It's very rare for a community to take such a measure, but talking to Marieke Verweij, director of the village's museum, you can understand why they want to do this.</p><p>\"In 2017 we had 1.7 million visitors… this year we're heading for 2.8 million,\" she says. \"But this is a small place! We just don't have room for all these people!\"</p><p>Worse, says Marieke Verweij, visitors often \"don't know that people live here so they walk into their gardens, they walk into their houses, they pee into their gardens, they knock on doors, they take pictures, they use selfie sticks to peek into the houses. So no privacy at all.\"</p></div><div><p>I leave the museum and walk past a coach car park in the general direction of the windmills. I probably shouldn't say this, as it's just going to make the problem worse, but these are some fabulous windmills.</p><p>One of them is wooden and painted green. Another has thatched walls.</p><p>Every so often the wind picks up and their sails go round. It's a fine sight - and one most people would want to get a picture with.</p><p>A lot of people are doing just that, of course. The windmills are actually still quite a long way off but, at the best spots, visitors form very civilised selfie-queues.</p><p>There's a bit of a queue also at a little bridge that leads over a canal towards the windmills. As I edge forward I hear Chinese, English, Spanish, Arabic, Italian and Russian.</p><p>The plan is to get everyone to book and pay online. The sort of thing you often have to do now to visit museums post-Covid.</p><p>The sweetener for tourists is that for the €17.50 they get admission to two things they currently have to pay for separately anyway – entry to the museum and to the inside of the windmills.</p><p>The former contains a painting of the local windmills by French impressionist Claude Monet, who visited in 1871. In the latter you can see how, in the 17th Century, the Dutch were using windmills not just to grind grain, but to do things like grind pigments to make paint or saw wood.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9b12/live/df33e7a0-8fec-11f0-be09-a9e2727d223b.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9b12/live/df33e7a0-8fec-11f0-be09-a9e2727d223b.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9b12/live/df33e7a0-8fec-11f0-be09-a9e2727d223b.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9b12/live/df33e7a0-8fec-11f0-be09-a9e2727d223b.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9b12/live/df33e7a0-8fec-11f0-be09-a9e2727d223b.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9b12/live/df33e7a0-8fec-11f0-be09-a9e2727d223b.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9b12/live/df33e7a0-8fec-11f0-be09-a9e2727d223b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9b12/live/df33e7a0-8fec-11f0-be09-a9e2727d223b.jpg.webp\" alt=\"The garden of one of the houses in the village, which is very pretty and quaint and is painted green and white.

New toilets, for example. But the shop and restaurant owners are not happy at all.</p><p>The stores, it should be said, are a bit of an attraction in themselves. The staff wear traditional costumes in the cheese shop, they do clog-making demonstrations in the shoe store.</p><p>And they are located inside old and beautiful wooden houses. The antique and gift shop for example, dates from 1623.</p><p>The planned entrance charge is threatening the livelihoods of Zaanse Schans's retailers and restaurant-owners, says Sterre Schaap. She co-runs the gift shop, which is called Trash and Treasures.</p><p>\"It's awful. It will mean that people who don't have a big wallet won't be able to come here,\" says Ms Schaap. \"It will mean that we will lose a lot of our shoppers.</p><p>\"If you're with a family of four and you have parking, it will be around €100.

Our communities are safe and calm,\" said Oregon Governor Tina Kotek on Saturday. </p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q74pxx871o\">Trump promised retribution - how far will he go?</a></li></ul></div><div><p>The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Portland has been targeted by protesters since early June, sometimes leading to violent clashes.</p><p>As of 8 September, the US Attorney's Office had brought federal charges against 26 people for crimes including arson, assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest.</p><p>The DHS said on Friday that demonstrators had \"repeatedly attacked and laid siege to an ICE processing centre\" in Portland.</p><p>The department stated that several individuals had been arrested and charged with federal offences in a post on social media.</p><p>\"Rose City Antifa, a recently designated domestic terrorist organisation, illegally doxed ICE officers,\" it wrote. </p><p>\"They published their home address online and on public flyers.

Such efforts, they said, could face constitutional challenges under the First Amendment, which protects free speech and assembly.</p><p>Democratic lawmakers have criticised both the president's rhetoric and the reported actions of ICE agents in the state.</p><p>Oregon Senator Ron Wyden said on Friday that there were \"credible\" reports that federal agents \"may be replaying the 2020 playbook\" - a reference to federal forces being deployed in response to protests over the murder of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody.</p><p>\"I urge Oregonians not to fall into Trump's attempt to incite violence,\" Wyden said.</p><p>Local lawmakers have also accused ICE of going after people who are not an actual danger to society.</p><p>\"ICE has said they're targeting people for arrest and detainment who have committed crimes. That's what they told us. But that's not what we are seeing,\" said Democratic house representative Suzanne Bonamici.</p><p>Lawmakers cited recent incidents, including the detention of a father outside his child's preschool and a wildland firefighter who was arrested while battling fires in the Olympic National Forest.</p><p>They also pointed to a statistic published by the Cato Institute, a US think tank based in Washington DC, which reported <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/65-people-taken-ice-had-no-convictions-93-no-violent-convictions\">that 65% of people detained by ICE had no criminal convictions</a>. </p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: National Guard arrives in Washington DC in August</figcaption><p></p><div><p>Despite the backlash from Democrats, the move has drawn support from some Republican officials.</p><p>US Labour Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said she had seen how \"lawlessness\" had turned Portland into a \"crime-ridden warzone\".</p><p>Chavez-DeRemer, who previously served as a Republican house representative for Oregon, thanked Trump \"for taking action to keep our ICE facilities protected and Make America Great Again\".</p><p>Earlier this year, Trump deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles and Washington DC. Federal agents are expected to arrive in Memphis in Tennessee next week.</p><p>In Los Angeles, the president ordered 2,000 federal personnel to deal with unrest over raids on undocumented migrants. Clashes erupted over several days, and tear gas was used to disperse protesting crowds.</p><p>A federal judge in California ruled earlier this month that the National Guard deployment in Los Angeles was illegal, and that it violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the power of the federal government to use military force for domestic matters.</p><p>It is unclear whether the president has legal ground to deploy federal forces to Oregon. </p></div></article>"

Turnout was 52%, higher than in recent years.</p><p>One of the main opposition leaders, Igor Dodon, had claimed victory even before results came in and called for protests outside parliament on Monday.</p></div><div><p>Recent Moldovan votes have been far closer, but it eventually became clear that Sandu's party was on course for another majority in the 101-seat parliament.</p><p>Four years ago, the president's party won 52.8% of the vote, and based on latest results it is now set to clinch 55 seats.</p><p>To form a government it will not need to rely on support from other parties, such as the Alternativa bloc or the populist Our Party.</p></div><div><p>In a measure of the tension surrounding the vote, bomb scares were reported at polling stations in Italy, Romania, Spain and the US.</p><p>Similar scares were reported in Moldova itself and three people were arrested on suspicion of plotting unrest the day after the vote. The head of Sandu's party, Igor Grosu, blamed criminal groups backed by Moscow for Sunday's incidents and appealed for \"patience and calm\" to let the electoral process continue.</p><p>Moldova also has a pro-Russian breakaway enclave called Transnistria along its border with Ukraine, complete with a Russian military presence. </p><p>Residents in this sliver of land have Moldovan passports. Many are strongly pro-Moscow and Socialist party leader Igor Dodon said there had been \"all sorts of harassment, stopping them from voting\".</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Sarah Rainsford reports from Moldova's administrative border with Transnistria</figcaption><p></p><div><p>Moldovans have been buffeted by Russia's full-scale war in neighbouring Ukraine, but they are also grappling with spiralling prices and high levels of corruption.</p><p>President Sandu, 53, who won a second term of office last November, warned Moldovans the future of their democracy was in their hands: \"Don't play with your vote or you'll lose everything!\"</p><p>Dodon, who is one of Sandu's main rivals, went on national TV as soon as polls closed to claim his pro-Russian allies in the Patriotic Electoral Bloc had won the election, despite there being no exit polls and before any early results were declared.</p></div><div><p>Thanking Moldovans for voting \"in record numbers\", Dodon called on the PAS government to leave power, and for supporters of all opposition parties to take to the streets on Monday to \"defend\" their vote outside parliament at midday.</p><p>\"We will not allow destabilisation,\" he promised. \"The citizens have voted. Their vote must be respected even if you don't like it,\" he added, addressing President Sandu and her party.</p><p>One of the parties in Dodon's bloc was barred from running two days before the vote because of alleged illicit funding. </p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8079/live/9e92d3b0-9c98-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8079/live/9e92d3b0-9c98-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8079/live/9e92d3b0-9c98-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8079/live/9e92d3b0-9c98-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8079/live/9e92d3b0-9c98-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8079/live/9e92d3b0-9c98-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8079/live/9e92d3b0-9c98-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8079/live/9e92d3b0-9c98-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp\" alt=\"Map of Moldova showing the Transnistria and Gagauzia\" /></p></div></figure><div><p>In the run-up to the vote, police reported evidence of an unprecedented effort by Russia to spread disinformation and buy votes. Dozens of men were also arrested, accused of travelling to Serbia for firearms training and co-ordinating unrest. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g5kl0n5d2o\">A BBC investigation uncovered a network</a> promising to pay participants if they posted pro-Russian propaganda and fake news.</p><p>Parties sympathetic to Moscow rejected the police claims as fake and a show - created by the government to scare people into supporting them. Russia's embassy in the UK rejected the BBC's allegations, accusing Moldova and its \"Western sponsors\" of seeking to divert attention from Chisinau's \"internal woes\". </p><p>Inside all the polling stations visited by the BBC a small camera had been placed on a tripod overlooking the transparent ballot boxes. </p><p>Election monitors said they were recording everything, to be checked if there were any reports of violations.</p></div><div><p>Dan Spatar, who was at one polling station in the capital with his young daughter said he was choosing a European future over a Russian past: \"We voted for this four years ago and deserve to continue with it.

Most cars had several people inside, often whole families.</p><p>By mid-afternoon, the queue stretched into the distance beyond a kiosk with a Soviet-style hammer-and-sickle emblem on top, and the green-and-red striped flag of Transnistria.</p><p>Speaking to drivers, most seemed unconcerned by the inconvenience, and the atmosphere was relatively relaxed.</p><p>One man told the BBC in Russian that he was voting for change because the PAS government had \"promised paradise and delivered nothing\". No-one would be more specific than that, insisting their voting preference was \"secret\".</p><p>Close to a giant statue of Lenin in the town of Anenii Noi, south-east of the Moldovan capital, a group of voters from Transnistria complained they had been sent first to one town and then another, because a bomb scare had closed the polling station. They believed it had been done deliberately to put them off voting. </p><p>One man said he ran a \"Russian business\" in the separatist enclave and was clear he wanted the pro-Russians back in power.</p></div></article>"

    "body": "4 hours agoDearbail JordanDeadly fire at Turkey ski resort hotelThe owner of a Turkish hotel and 10 others have been sentenced to life in prison following the deadliest fire in the country's history.The blaze at the Grand Kartal Hotel in Bolu broke out during school holidays in January, killed 78 people including 34 children.Owner Halit Ergül, his wife and two daughters were handed the maximum penalty after being found guilty of severe negligence, along with Bolu's deputy mayor and the local fire chief.In total, there were 32 people facing charges over the fire which tore through the building in the early hours of the morning, resulting in some residents jumping from the 12-storey building to escape the flames. What lead to the hotel fire disaster?Dozens killed as fire engulfs Turkish ski hotelIn addition, 137 people were injured in the blaze at the northern mountain resort of Kartalkaya. Hilmi Altin, who lost his wife and nine-year-old daughter, told AFP news agency: \"I go to the cemetery each day. No psychologist can ease such a pain.\"An inquiry found that some safety equipment had not worked at the time of the fire, which started in the hotel's restaurant. Also, some of the building's gas equipment did not meet safety standards.Ergul denied responsibility. He said the hotel had regular inspections and blamed the gas supplier. He also said the tourism ministry was responsible for oversight.\"If I had foreseen the risk, I would have closed the hotel myself,\" he told the hearing which took place inside a specially constructed court room at a local school. A further 18 defendants received sentences ranging from 12 to 22 years. Most were hotel employees. Others were acquitted, including two cooks.The Bolu mountains are popular with skiers from Istanbul and Turkey's capital Ankara, which is about 170km (105 miles) away. At the time of the disaster, the hotel was operating at high occupancy as it was the start of school holidays.",

    "body": "5 hours agoJessica MurphyUniversal Images Group via Getty ImagesThe Trump administration cannot suspend food aid used by more than 40 million low-income Americans amid the ongoing US government shutdown, two federal judges have ruled. The decisions, issued within moments of each other on Friday by judges in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, said the government must pay for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or Snap, benefits using emergency funds.The Snap programme works by giving people reloadable debit cards that they can use to buy essential grocery items.The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced this week it would not distribute food assistance funds in November due to the shutdown, saying \"the well has run dry\". A family of four on average receives $715 (£540) per month, which breaks down to a little less than $6 (£4.50) per day, per person.The states administer the benefits, using money from the federal government, which has been unfunded and shut down since 1 October. Several states have pledged to use their own funds to cover any shortfall, however the federal government has warned that they will not be reimbursed.Half of US states had sued the Trump administration over its plans to halt funding, hoping to force it to use a roughly $6bn (£4.5bn) emergency contingency fund for  Snap, also known as food stamps.The Massachusetts judge said the administration must access the contingency funding to pay the benefits and had until Monday to report back to the court on whether they will authorise at least partial benefits for November.Massachusetts US District Judge Indira Talwani wrote in her decision that the  states who sued are likely to win in court on their claim that \"Congress intended the funding of SNAP benefits, at a reduced rate if necessary, when appropriated funds prove insufficient\".Judge Talwani also wrote that the Trump administration \"erred in concluding\" that the USDA is blocked by law from tapping the emergency reserves in the contingency fund when there is a lapse in federal funding.The USDA had said those reserves were insufficient to pay full benefits, which cost $8.5bn to $9bn each month. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins had said she would only use the fund for an emergency such as a natural disaster.Even if the government turns to the contingency fund, it would only be able to cover about 60% of beneficiaries in a single month, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a think-tank focused on policies that help low-income families.Judge Talwani has asked the administration to report on Monday whether it will use the fund to pay reduced benefits or if it will pay full benefits for the month by moving money from other programmes, similar to the administration transferring military research funds earlier this month to pay members of the armed forces.Separately in Rhode Island, a lawsuit was brought by a number of US cities and NGOs who sued over what they called the \"unlawful suspension\" of the programme.\"There is no doubt and it is beyond argument that irreparable harm will begin to occur if it hasn't already occurred in the terror it has caused some people about the availability of funding for food, for their family,\" US  District Judge John  McConnell said.The White House and the USDA did not comment on the decisions. The BBC has also contacted the Office of Management and Budget for comment.At a news conference before the rulings were issued, Rollins said \"we're looking at all the options\" when asked whether the administration would comply if courts required it to release funds. On Friday, the group behind the lawsuit filed in Rhode Island said in a statement that the ruling \"is a lifeline for millions of families, seniors, and veterans who depend on SNAP to put food on the table\".\"It reaffirms a fundamental principle: no administration can use hunger as a political weapon.\"Republicans and Democrats have traded blame for the federal shutdown, which will soon enter its second month, and there has not been any meaningful progress toward a deal.",

    "body": "French actor Tchéky Karyo, who had a starring role in the film Nikita and the TV series The Missing, has died aged 72.Karyo, who was born in Turkey but grew up in Paris, died of a cancer on Friday, AFP news agency reported. Known largely for supporting roles, Karyo acted in films for nearly four decades, finding a second career in TV series in his final years.Karyo's wife, actress Valérie Keruzoré, and their children announced his death in a statement to the news agency. Karyo first made his mark in crime thriller La Balance (1982) and he played the handler Bob in Luc Besson's assassin film Nikita (1990).BBC audiences might best remember him for his role in The Missing (2014).The first eight-part series, about the search for a missing boy in France, starred Karyo as French detective Julien Baptiste. James Nesbitt and Frances O'Connor played the boy's parents.The second eight-part series, about a missing girl in Germany, was brodcast in 2016. Karyo returned as Baptiste, with David Morrissey and Keeley Hawes as the girl's parents.Both series received positive reviews, with critics praising the cast, especially Karyo's performance. In February 2019, a spin-off series titled Baptiste was broadcast on BBC One. Lindsay Salt, Director of BBC Drama, said: \"We are so sad to learn of the passing of Tchéky Karyo. He was a truly brilliant and much loved actor and he will be fondly remembered by BBC viewers for his roles in The Missing, Baptiste and most recently Boat Story. Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones at this time.\"Karyo was born on 4 October 1953 in Istanbul, the son of a Turkish lorry driver of Spanish-Jewish origin and a Greek mother, Le Monde newspaper writes.After several years as a theatrical actor, he saw his role in La Balance earn him a nomination for the César Award for Best Male Revelation.With his strong jaw and penetrating stare, he went on to star in dozens of films of all kinds. Other French films included Besson's Joan of Arc (1993) and the anti-war epic A Very Long Engagement (2004). He was also cast in Ridley Scott's 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992) and in the James Bond film GoldenEye (1995).One of his starring roles was as the medieval prophet Nostradamus in the 1994 film of the same name, while his tiniest role was undoubtedly in Amélie (2001) where he only appeared as a face on an ID photograph in an album.",

    "body": "Five people have been charged in connection with the 2023 overdose death of Robert De Niro's grandson and two other 19 year olds. New York authorities accuse the suspects, Bruce Epperson, Eddie Barreto, Grant McIver, John Nicolas, and Roy Nicolas, of running a fentanyl distribution network that sold counterfeit prescription opioid pills through social media to teenagers and young adults in the city. Authorities link the network to the overdose deaths of Leandro De Niro-Rodriguez,  Akira Stein - daughter of Blondie co-founder Chris Stein - and a third unnamed victim.The five are each charged with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute.\"Through their alleged actions, these defendants left behind a trail of irreversible loss that cut short the lives of three teenagers who held boundless potential and who had already made profound, immeasurable impacts on those who knew them,\" said Homeland Security Investigations New York special agent in charge Ricky Patel in a statement on Thursday. Prosecutors allege the five used social media and encrypted messaging apps to sell thousands fentanyl-laced pills in New York between January and July 2023.They allege that over that summer, the drugs they sold led to at least three deaths. Stein was found dead 30 May after taking fentanyl-laced pills she allegedly  purchased from John and Roy Nicolas. The unnamed victim, who died 13 June, allegedly purchased pills through an intermediary from Mr McIver.Authorities say De Niro-Rodriguez, who died 2 July, got pills from a dealer who allegedly obtained them from Mr McIver, Mr Epperson, and Mr Barreto.Separatedly in 2023, a woman was arrested for allegedly selling De Niro-Rodriguez three counterfeit oxycodone pills containing fentanyl - the drugs believed to have led to his death - and tablets of Xanax.In a statement after the death of his grandson, Academy-Award winner De Niro said he was \"deeply distressed\" by the passing of his \"beloved grandson\", who was the only child of his daughter Drena.In a statement on Instagram on Thursday, Chris Stein noted the arrests in his daughter's case and thanked officials \"for this hope of some justice for her\".If found guilty, the charges carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life in prison, officials said.

    "body": "A Japanese superhero series that inspired the hugely popular Power Rangers TV and movie franchise from the 1990s is ending after 50 years, local media report.Super Sentai will go off air as sales from merchandise and events have not been enough to cover production costs, reports say. Its broadcaster TV Asahi declined to comment on \"future programming\", according to the Asahi newspaper.The series premiered in 1975 and its formula - five teens who transform into colourful masked fighters to battle aliens - served as the blueprint for Power Rangers in the US and many other superhero shows that aired in Asia.It also served as a launchpad for the careers of many Japanese actors.Super Sentai was much more than a TV series. The show that aired weekly was essentially an advertisement for toys, clothes, costumes and collectibles.For animation and toy fans outside Japan, it served as a gateway to the country's colourful superhero and comic book culture.Similar shows like Choudenshi Bioman and Hikari Sentai Maskman were dubbed in English and developed cult followings in the Philippines.In the Super Sentai series, the superhero team, made up of three men and two women, is led by a fighter in a red suit - as in Power Rangers. The rest of team is colour-coded, green or black for the second-in-command, followed by blue, yellow and pink.Every episode also followed the same sequence - starting with martial arts and swordfights and ending with a battle between their robot spaceship and a giant alien in the end. A large part of its appeal is the live-action animation, which in the 1980s and 1990s bordered on crude.The original Power Rangers series aired on US TV from 1993 to 1996 and there have been multiple spin-offs. The episodes are now streamed on YouTube.Producer Haim Saban, who adapted Power Rangers from the Japanese original, said in a 2017 interview with the LA Times that the concept was a tough sell at first.\"Every selling season, I would go out and offer it to the networks - and would get kicked out of the room... They told me how crazy I was,\" he said.News of Super Sentai's demise drew sadness from fans and celebrities.Popular actress Keiko Kitagawa re-posted a news article on the reported cancellation with the caption \"despair\". Her post on X was viewed 15 million times.Yasuhisa Furuhara, an actor who played one of the Super Sentai fighters, noted how the series ran for half a century. \"I'm proud to be a part of history,\" he said on X.One fan on X said his parents had watched Super Sentai when they were children. And that he is watching the current series. \"I'll miss it... What a shame.\"\"Super Sentai is coming to an end, so what should boys watch from now on?\" another fan said.",

    "body": "US space agency Nasa has rejected reality star Kim Kardashian's claim that the 1969 space mission to land the first man on the Moon was faked.\"Yes, we've been to the Moon before... 6 times!\" Nasa acting administrator Sean Duffy wrote on social media.Kardashian made the comments on the latest episode of her long-running TV series The Kardashians, telling co-star Sarah Paulson she thought the Moon landing \"didn't happen\".Despite being consistently debunked, conspiracy theories as to whether humans actually reached the Moon have persisted for more than 50 years, particularly with the rise of social media. In the episode, Kardashian can be seen showing Paulson an interview with astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who along with Neil Armstrong took the first steps on the lunar surface during the Apollo 11 mission.\"I'm sending you a million articles with both Buzz Aldrin and the other one,\" Kardashian says, before reading a quote allegedly from Aldrin responding to a question about the scariest moment of the expedition.\"There was no scary moment because it didn't happen. It could've been scary, but it wasn't because it didn't happen,\" she reads.It is unclear which article Kardashian was reading from, or if the quotes were actually from Aldrin.The reality star is later seen telling a producer that she believes the Moon landing was fake.\"I think it was fake. I've seen a few videos on Buzz Aldrin talking about how it didn't happen. He says it all the time now, in interviews. Maybe we should find Buzz Aldrin,\" she says.Following the broadcast, Duffy tagged Kardashian in a post on X, rebuffing her comments, and promoted Nasa's current moon exploration program Artemis, which is \"going back under the leadership\" of Donald Trump.\"We won the last space race and we will win this one too,\" he added.In response, Kardashian wrote back asking about the interstellar object named 3I/Atlas, which astronomers said could be the oldest comet ever seen.\"Wait…. what's the tea on 3I Atlas?!?!!!!!!!?????\" she replied.Duffy later invited Kardashian to the Kennedy Space Center for the launch of the Artemis mission to the moon.For  decades, scientists and experts have rebutted conspiracy theories claiming the Apollo 11 mission was a hoax.\"Every single argument claiming that Nasa faked the Moon landings has been discredited,\" according to the Institute of Physics.",

Now measuring 162.91 metres tall, the Spanish basilica has officially pipped the record from the Ulm Minster in Germany, which has held the crown since 1890.Designed by acclaimed architect Antoni Gaudí, the place of worship has been under construction in the centre of Barcelona for more than a century, with the main building due to be completed next year. The central Tower of Jesus Christ will grow with the addition of the rest of the cross over the next few months, eventually standing at 172 metres tall. The first stone of the Sagrada Família was placed in 1882, with up-and-coming architect Gaudí taking over the project the following year. He transformed the original designs for the basilica into a far more ambitious proposal, which was initially funded by donations from repentant worshippers. At the time of his unexpected death in 1926, just one of the planned 18 towers had been built.In the years following, the construction of the architectural marvel was managed by the Sagrada Família foundation, and funded by contributions from tourists, visitors and private donors.Getty ImagesIn addition to the death of its primary architect, the basilica has hit a number of roadblocks throughout its almost 150-year construction. During the Spanish Civil War, Catalan anarchists set fire to the crypt, destroying plans and plaster models created by Gaudí that would guide future construction.Most recently, the Covid-19 pandemic saw construction on the building halted, with members of the foundation attributing the pause to a lack of tourism, and the subsequent drop in funding for the project.Behind the scenes of stunning La Sagrada FamiliaGaudí’s La Sagrada Família: Genius or folly?In September this year, Sagrada Família General Director Xavier Martínez told the Associated Press that the Tower of Jesus Christ would be completed in 2026, to coincide with the centenary of Gaudí's death.The foundation will hold a series of events to commemorate the architect, who is buried in the church's crypt.Work on decorative details, sculptures and a stairway leading to the building's main entrance is expected to continue over the next decade.",

    "body": "17 hours agoCherylann MollanBBC News, MumbaiIndia and the US have signed a framework agreement to expand defence cooperation over the next 10-years. The pact was announced after a meeting between US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh in Kuala Lumpur. The agreement will enhance \"coordination, information sharing and tech cooperation\" and advance \"regional stability and deterrence\", Hegseth said on X. It comes as the two countries are trying to close a trade deal and tide over tense ties after US President Donald Trump slapped 50% tariffs on India, including a 25% penalty for buying Russian oil and arms. The agreement is expected to provide policy direction to the entire spectrum of the India-US defence relationship. \"It is a signal of our growing strategic convergence and will herald a new decade of partnership. Defence will remain as a major pillar of our bilateral relations. Our partnership is critical for ensuring a free, open and rules-based Indo-Pacific region,\" Singh said, in a post on X. According to Pramit Pal Chaudhuri of the Eurasia Group think tank, the agreement was supposed to have been concluded in July-August this year, but India's irritation at Trump's statements about his role in ending the conflict with Pakistan led to it getting delayed. The pact is the latest in a series of agreements between the two countries that have made it \"easier for the two militaries to achieve interoperability, India to access technology and the two defence sectors to work together\", Mr Chaudhuri said. \"This provides for further potential in all three areas,\" he added. India and the US have been steadily ramping up their defence ties recently. Defence was a major talking point between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump on the former's visit to the US in February this year, withTrump saying the US would increase military equipment sales to India by many billions of dollars,  ultimately paving the way to providing Delhi with F-35 stealth warplanes.But since then, Delhi's dependence on discounted Russian oil as well as its long-standing defence relationship with Moscow have been a major point of irritation for the Trump administration. While Russia continues to be a major supplier of arms to India, its share of Indian defence imports has been steadily falling as Delhi seeks to diversify its portfolio and boost domestic capacity.In recent months India has hinted that it would be open to increasing energy and defence purchases from the US. The two countries are locked in high-stakes trade talks, aimed at reaching a long-awaited deal by November. With inputs from Soutik Biswas, India correspondent with the BBC.",

    "body": "8 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorPierre Crom/Getty ImagesRob Jetten, 38, is now tipped to become the youngest prime minister in modern Dutch historyCentrist liberal leader Rob Jetten has claimed victory in Wednesday's nail-biting Dutch election, after vote analysis indicated his party could not be beaten by anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders.Jetten's D66 party currently has a narrow lead of 15,000 votes over Wilders' Freedom Party, and Dutch news agency ANP says even though the vote count is not complete, Wilders can no longer win.\"We are the biggest party in the Netherlands! Now we'll get to work for all Dutch people,\" Jetten posted on X. Wilders said it was the electoral council not a news agency that decided the result: \"What arrogance not to wait for that.\"Projections from about 99% of the vote put both parties on 26 seats in the 150-seat parliament - but ANP says Jetten's centrists could win a 27th seat.Jetten, 38, told reporters he was \"very proud of this historic result\" and now felt a great responsibility to form a stable and ambitious government.Wilders had led opinion polls going into Wednesday's election, but Rob Jetten succeeded in winning in some of the main Dutch cities including Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht with a positive campaign using a catchphrase of \"Yes, we can\". No Dutch election race has ever been so close, and if Jetten does become prime minister he will be the youngest in Dutch history.Until now Jetten was careful not to declare victory until all votes were in, but ANP said based on figures from postal voters abroad he could now be declared the winner.Wilders said even if D66 did go on to become the biggest party, his Freedom Party (PVV) would \"not let the Netherlands be broken up by Jetten and his people\".Jetten told reporters that his party had \"shown to the rest of Europe and the world that it is possible to beat the populist movements if you campaign with a positive message\".The Dutch electoral system is based on proportional representation in one nationwide constituency, so whichever party secures most votes wins most seats. Jetten's liberals have so far won 16.9% of the vote, while Wilders' Freedom Party is on 16.7%. As results came in on Thursday, the race was so close that the lead flipped between the two parties.In a sign that he was not ready to concede victory, Wilders dubbed the Dutch news agency \"ANP66\" and shared unfounded claims from social media of vote-rigging. One local authority, in Zaanstad outside Amsterdam, rejected the allegation as \"fabricated\".Although the D66 leader's path to forming a coalition is not straightforward, Jetten has said he wants to make a quick start.Jetten said after the vote that never before had a party won a Dutch election with fewer than 30 seats. He will need the support of at least three other parties to gather the 76 seats needed to form a coalition. The most obvious candidates would be the conservative-liberal VVD, the left-wing Labour (PvdA)-GreenLeft alliance and the Christian Democrats, but it could take months if that is to happen.VVD leader Dilan Yesilgöz has so far ruled out working with the left, but Jetten said he favoured a broad-based government from the centre of Dutch politics.The weekend would be a good chance for all the parties to reflect, before a \"scout\" is given the task next Tuesday of sounding them out. Jetten said he wanted to construct a coalition that represented best the millions of voters who had backed other parties to tackle the main issues, including the housing shortage and asylum and migration.His path to victory has stunned observers. Less than two years ago he led D66 - a party formed by democratic reformers in 1966 - to fifth place and just nine seats. Only a few weeks ago they were still languishing in the opinion polls, but gradually improved as Jetten put in several polished performances in TV debates and even  competed in the final of a TV quiz show 11 days before the election.Outgoing Prime Minister Dick Schoof predicted on Friday that Jetten's task of forming a coalition would prove complicated. \"I reckon I'll still be prime minister at Christmas - I'd be surprised if it happened [by then]\".Schoof, a former chief of Dutch intelligence, was picked for the top job by Geert Wilders, who abandoned his bid to lead the country last year because his prospective coalition partners would not support having a far-right prime minister.Wilders won the last election in November 2023, and a government was only formed in July 2024. Eleven months later, he brought his own government down, in a row with his coalition partners over asylum and migration policy.",

    "body": "9 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorLatvian MPs have voted to withdraw from an international accord aimed at protecting women from violence, including domestic abuse, after a long and intense debate in parliament.Several thousand people protested against the vote this week in Riga. It is now up to President Edgars Rinkevics to decide whether to approve the law or not.Known as the Istanbul Convention, the 2011 treaty only came into force in Latvia last year, requiring governments to develop laws and support services to end all violence.Latvia is the first EU country to move towards pulling out of the treaty. Turkey withdrew in 2021, a move described as a huge setback by top human rights body  the Council of Europe.It is a setback for centre-right Prime Minister Evika Silina, who joined protesters outside parliament earlier this week. \"We will not give up, we will fight so that violence does not win,\" she told them.The treaty was ratified by the EU in 2023, however ultra-conservative groups have argued that the accord's focus on gender equality undermines family values and promotes \"gender ideology\".After a 13-hour debate in the Saeima, Latvian MPs voted by 56 to 32 to withdraw from the treaty, in a move sponsored by opposition parties but backed by politicians from one of the three coalition parties, the Union of Greens and Farmers.One of the main political groups behind the withdrawal is Latvia First, whose leader Ainars Slesers has called on Latvians to choose between a \"natural family\" and a \"gender ideology with multiple sexes\".Latvia's ombudswoman Karina Palkova called for the treaty not to be politicised, and the group Equality Now said it was \"not a threat to Latvian values, it was a tool to realise them\".Thursday's vote has prompted an outcry both within Latvia and beyond. Twenty-two thousand people have signed a Latvian petition not to drop the treaty. Women's rights group Centrs Marta has called a protest next Thursday, accusing MPs of not listening to the Latvian people.The head of the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly, Theodoros Rousopoulos, said Latvia had made a hasty decision fuelled by disinformation. It was, he said, an \"unprecedented and deeply worrying step backwards for women's rights and human rights in Europe\".Since Turkey abandoned the treaty four years ago, femicide and violence against women had risen sharply, he added.As the vote did not win a two-thirds majority, it means the president could return the bill for another reading, if he has objections. President Rinkevics said on X that he would assess the decision under the constitution, \"taking into account state and legal, rather than ideological or political, considerations\".Last week another member of the ruling coalition, the Progressives, said it would not rule out appealing to the Constitutional Court.Women are more likely to be victims of partner violence than men, according to the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE), an EU agency.In its latest figures, EIGE said 142 incidents of intimate partner violence against women were reported across Latvia in 2022. This was above the 109 offences recorded in 2021 but below the totals in the previous three years and during the Covid pandemic.",

    "body": "On Wednesday, over tea and cakes with veterans of the Ukraine war, President Vladimir Putin announced Russia had tested a new weapon.\"There is nothing like this,\" the Russian leader said of the Poseidon - a nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable underwater drone that can be fired like a torpedo and which a senior Russian MP said could \"put entire states out of operation\". When it was first unveiled in 2018, Russian media said the Poseidon would be able to achieve a speed of 200km/h (120mph) and travel in a \"constantly changing route\" that would make it impossible to intercept.Putin's claim came only days after the announcement that Moscow had conducted a test of its \"unlimited-range\" Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile. It's \"a unique product, unmatched in the world\", Putin said of the Burevestnik, noting the missile was so new \"we are yet to identify what it is, what class of weapons [it] belongs to\".It is not unusual for Russia to test and flaunt weapons.And, despite the boisterous nature of Russian announcements, their military value is ambiguous.\"They are basically Armageddon weapons - too powerful to be used unless you're happy to destroy the world,\" Mark Galeotti, a Russia scholar and long-time observer of Russian politics, told the BBC.Both the Poseidon and the Burevestnik are second-strike, retaliatory weapons, Mr Galeotti added - and not even the most rabid Kremlin propagandists are suggesting anyone is preparing to launch strikes on Russia. It is also unclear whether the weapons are actually viable. In 2019, five Russian nuclear engineers died in a rocket engine explosion which some Russian and Western experts said was linked to the Burevestnik.Two years later, the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) - a London-based think tank specialising in global conflict and security - noted that Russia faced \"considerable technical challenges\" in ensuring \"the reliable performance of the nuclear-propulsion unit\" of the missile.Neither the Poseidon nor the Burevestnik were entirely novel - both had first been presented to the world in 2018 as part of a new array of weapons that Putin called \"invincible\".So it is the timing of the announcements - rather than their contents - which could be noteworthy. After a whirlwind few months of tentative diplomacy by US President Donald Trump to try and bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table, Trump appears to have cooled off on the endeavour to end the war. Last week, the White House cancelled a summit between Trump and Putin, apparently after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio realised the gulf between Moscow and Washington's positions was too great for a high-level meeting to achieve meaningful results.Not only is there no suggestion of any further talks, but soon after the meeting was cancelled, Trump imposed sanctions on two of Russia's biggest oil producers as punishment for Moscow's failure to agree on a peace deal in Ukraine.And while his relationship with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky seems to still be fraught, it appears Trump is growing irritated with Moscow's intractability.So Putin may be vying for Trump's attention. \"In the face of Trump blowing hot and cold with his support for Ukraine or sympathy to Russia, here is an element in which Moscow has bigger cards than Kyiv,\" Mr Galeotti argued. \"So in that context [successful weapons tests] are more about keeping him thinking Russia is indeed powerful.\"Another clue could come from the battlefield in Ukraine. Three-and-a-half years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour, its troops continue to merely grind on - at great cost in human life and resources - with no obvious breakthrough likely any time soon.\"We are getting towards the end of summer fighting season in Ukraine and it has not gone very well for the Russians,\" said David Heathcote, head of intelligence at McKenzie Intelligence Services.The announcements about the Burevestnik and the Poseidon should be seen as a reflection of the weakness of their conventional forces, Mr Heathcote told the BBC. Russia is not formally part of any military alliances that would serve as a deterrent if it is on the back foot, and its army is tied up and under pressure in Ukraine. In these cases, Mr Heathcote says, \"the Russians always react with unnecessary and overexaggerated sabre rattling\".While Moscow's decision to publicly announce the Burevestnik and Poseidon tests may have been influenced by this, it seems the claim has already had the tangible effect of provoking Trump into instructing its military to resume nuclear weapons testing.Trump justified the move as a way of keeping pace with other countries such as Russia and China. \"With others doing testing, I think it's appropriate that we do also,\" Trump said - although it will likely take several months for the US to restart nuclear tests after a 33-year pause.The Kremlin's reaction to Trump's statement was quickPutin spokesman Dmitry Peskov questioned whether the US president had been correctly informed. The Russian tests \"cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test\", Peskov said. Trump did not elaborate on the kind of tests he wanted the US to resume.It was likely, said IISS Head of Strategy, Technology and Arms Control Dr Alexander Bollfrass, that Trump's decision was a direct response to the Russian test of the Burevestnik and that the US could be planning to conduct similar flight tests of US Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles.

    "body": "8 hours agoMayeni Jones,Africa correspondent, Bernd Debusmann Jr,at the White House and Natasha BootyThe South African government has criticised the US's decision to prioritise refugee applications from white Afrikaners, saying claims of a white genocide have been widely discredited and lack reliable evidence.It highlighted an open letter published by prominent members of the Afrikaner community earlier this week rejecting the narrative, with some signatories calling the relocation scheme racist.The limited number of white South African Afrikaners signing up to relocate to the US was indication that they were not being persecuted, it added.On Thursday, the administration of US President Donald Trump announced its lowest refugee annual cap on record - to just 7,500.The exact figures of the number of white South Africans who have been admitted through the US scheme are not available. South Africa's latest crime statistics do not indicate that more white people have fallen victim to violent crime than other racial groups. Earlier this year President Trump offered refugee status to Afrikaners - who are mostly descendants of Dutch and French settlers - after South African President Cyril Ramaphosa signed a law allowing the government to seize land without compensation in rare instances. Is there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?Unpacking the South African land law that so inflames TrumpOn the road incorrectly identified as a 'burial site' by TrumpMost private farmland is owned by white South Africans who make up just over 7% of the population.Several months ago, South Africa's ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool, was expelled after accusing Trump of \"mobilising a supremacism\" and trying to \"project white victimhood as a dog whistle\".In the Oval Office in May, Trump confronted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa and claimed white farmers in his nation were being killed and \"persecuted\".President Trump held up a photo purporting to show body bags containing the remains of white people in South Africa, but the Reuters news agency later identified the photo as one of their own - taken thousands of miles away in the war-struck Democratic Republic of Congo.Washington did not comment on the claim that they had misidentified the image.The White House also played a video which they said showed burial sites for murdered white farmers. It later emerged that the videos were scenes from a 2020 protest in which the crosses represented farmers killed over multiple years.",

    "body": "14 hours agoSuranjana Tewari,Asia Business Correspondent in Gyeongju and Osmond Chia,Business reporterUS chip giant Nvidia will supply more than 260,000 of its most advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips to South Korea's government, as well as Samsung, LG, and Hyundai.The companies will all deploy the AI chips in factories to make everything from semiconductors and robots to autonomous vehicles and meant that South Korea can \"now produce intelligence as a new export,\" chief executive Jensen Huang said.Mr Huang did not disclose the value of the South Korean deals.It caps off a busy week for Nvidia, which on Wednesday became the first company to be valued at $5 trillion and on Thursday saw signs of a thaw in US-China trade relations that may mean it can export more of its chips to China .Speaking at a CEO summit on the sidelines of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) in Gyeongju, South Korea, Mr Huang added that with the chips, companies would be able to create \"digital twins\" with other factories around the world.These deals form part of Nvidia's latest effort to expand AI infrastructure globally, to further integrate AI into products and services.Nvidia has been striking international partnerships which helped it become the first company ever to be valued at $5tn (£3.8tn) on Wednesday.The South Korea deals come as Nvidia grapples with the fallout of the China-US trade war.China made up more than a tenth of Nvidia's revenue last year, but the extent of China's access to Nvidia's chips has been a point of friction with Washington.\"We used to have 95% share of the AI business in China. Now we're at 0% share. And I'm disappointed by that,\" Huang said in Gyeongju on Friday.Trump said after his meeting with Xi on Thursday that Beijing will hold talks with Nvidia to discuss sales of its chips in China.Trump said the talks remained between China and the US company, but that the US government will play the role of a \"referee\" of sorts.On Friday, Huang said he would like to sell Nvidia's state-of-the-art Blackwell chips to China, although the decision needed to be made by the US President.The US imposes export controls on sales to China of Nvidia's most-advanced AI chips.The tech boss had no news on China sales, or the talks between the two leaders but that he hopes they'll find a way to have new policies that allow chips back into China. \"It's in the best interest of America to have the China market and it's in China's interest to have an American company bring technology to the country,\" Huang said.\"We'd like to see American technology be the global standard.\"South Korea - which is already home to major semiconductor companies and vehicle manufacturers - wants to become a regional AI hub.The country is the ideal place to expand AI infrastructure, according to the Nvidia CEO, because of its access to energy and land, and its ability to construct factories. President Lee Jae Myung said he would prioritise AI investment after coming into office in the face of US tariffs.With the Nvidia deal, the South Korean government plans to build computing infrastructure that it will control, a term known as \"sovereign AI\". More than 50,000 Nvidia chips will power data centres at the National AI Computing Center and facilities owned by South Korean companies like Kakao and Naver.The chip giant is dependent on the tightly-knit supply chains that run through the Asia Pacific region.Nvidia is primarily a chip designer, and so outsources most of its physical production to manufacturers like Samsung, SK Hynix and TSMC.TSMC has been a critical partner for Nvidia, making the company's most advanced AI chips, including its flagship Blackwell series.Samsung makes parts for Nvidia's H20 chips, a scaled-down processor made for the Chinese market under US export rules.National security experts and some politicians have long voiced concerns about the US selling AI chips to China, saying that Beijing could use them to gain an advantage in AI, as well as in military applications.Analysts say that US efforts to block China's access to advanced computer chips have fostered innovation within China.Both Huawei and Alibaba have unveiled their own chips that they say can rival Nvidia's products for the Chinese market.Beijing has also reportedly prohibited local firms from buying from Nvidia, urging them to buy from Chinese chipmakers to give its domestic tech industry a boost.\"We respect deeply the capabilities of China,\" Nvidia's Jensen Huang said on Friday.Nvidia's share price was this week further boosted by a wave of new deals, including partnerships with the US Department of Energy, Nokia, Uber, and Stellantis - moves aimed at reassuring investors that AI investments will deliver returns.Hopes of a revival in China sales, following trade talks between Presidents Trump and Xi, also lifted its share price.Additional reporting by Jaltson Akkanath Chummar",

    "body": "12 hours agoRachel Hagan and Imogen Foulkes,Geneva CorrespondentEPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockThe UN's human rights chief has condemned US military strikes on vessels allegedly carrying drugs in the Caribbean and Pacific, saying the lethal attacks violate international law and amount to \"extrajudicial killing\".Volker Türk said on Friday that more than 60 people have reportedly been killed in US strikes since early September.Calling the attacks \"unacceptable\", he said Washington must halt them immediately and conduct prompt, independent and transparent investigations.President Donald Trump has said the strikes are necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the US and he has the legal authority to continue bombing boats in international waters.Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth has said strikes are being carried out on vessels operated by drug-trafficking groups designated as terrorist organisations by the US, saying this week that \"the Western Hemisphere is no longer a safe haven for narco-terrorists bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans\".Türk, while acknowledging the challenges of tackling drug trafficking, said in a statement that the circumstances for the deadly strikes \"find no justification in international law\".\"Countering the serious issue of illicit trafficking of drugs across international borders is - as has long been agreed among States - a law-enforcement matter, governed by the careful limits on lethal force set out in international human rights law.\"Under law, the intentional use of lethal force \"is only permissible as a last resort against individuals who pose an imminent threat to life\", he said.He added that based on \"very sparse information provided publicly by the US authorities, none of the individuals on the targeted boats appeared to pose an imminent threat to lives of others\".He called on the US to use law enforcement methods including intercepting boats and detaining suspects, and if necessary, prosecuting individuals.Watch: What we know about US strikes targeting alleged drug boatsMost strikes have taken place off the coast of South America in the Caribbean, though attacks in the Pacific this week killed at least 18 people, according to Hegseth.In the Caribbean, the US has deployed troops, aircraft and naval vessels and last week ordered the world's largest warship - the USS Gerald R Ford - to the area.The strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. Members of US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have also raised concerns and questioned the president's authority to order them.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her government does not \"agree with these attacks\" and has called for meetings with the US ambassador, insisting that \"all international treaties be respected.\"BBC NewsThe US actions have also heightened tensions between Washington and the governments of Colombia and Venezuela.The US has placed sanctions on Colombian president Gustavo Petro, accusing him of failing to curb drug trafficking and allowing cartels to \"flourish\". Petro has responded that he has been fighting drug trafficking \"for decades\".Trump has also accused Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of leading a drug-trafficking organisation, which he denies.Venezuela's attorney general told the BBC there is \"no doubt\" that Trump is trying to overthrow the Venezuelan government. He accused the US of hoping to seize the country's natural resources, including reserves of gold, oil and copper.The US is among many nations that do not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader, after the last election in 2024 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair. Opposition tallies from polling stations showed its candidate had won by a landslide.",

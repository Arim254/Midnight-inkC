    "body": "1 hour agoThomas Naadi,BBC Africa, Accra andJean OtalorCyber Security AuthorityThe authorities released pictures of some of those found in the raids along with their equipmentGhana's security forces have arrested nine Nigerians suspected of co-ordinating a host of cyber-crime activities from makeshift offices in and around the capital, Accra.Forty-four others, believed to be victims brought to Ghana from Nigeria under false pretences, have also been detained and handed over to the immigration authority.During the two-day intelligence-led operation, raids uncovered 62 laptops, 52 mobile phones and two pump-action guns, the authorities have said.There is a growing trend of foreigners being lured to Ghana under the pretext of lucrative work. They are then put in gated compounds, have their documents confiscated and are compelled to engage in cyber-crime.They often work on romance scams, where a victim is encouraged to send money to a fictitious partner who they believe is real, or business email compromise, where someone poses as an employer and gets people to sends funds or sensitive data.The weekend's operation was jointly co-ordinated by a host of agencies, including the Cyber Security Authority (CSA).''All the arrested individuals have been duly profiled and handed over to the Ghana Immigration Service for safekeeping and further investigations,\" Communications Minister Sam George said in a post on X.\"We caution foreign nationals invited to Ghana to verify claims made by their fellow nationals to lure them here.''George also indicated that suspects arrested in previous recent operations have been handed over to Nigerian law enforcement or are facing prosecution.The CSA and other agencies have been making efforts to flush out cyber-criminals, including working with the US authorities to arrest high-profile suspects. Among recent operations was the arrest of a popular Ghanaian social media influencer known as Abu Trica, whose real name is Frederick Kumi, who allegedly stole $8m (£5.9m) from vulnerable Americans through a romance scam. He has not yet commented on the allegations.Another successful operation was the dismantling of a syndicate that defrauded over 200 victims of $400,000 (£300,000).You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Three shark attacks have been reported in Sydney in a little over 24 hours, leaving at least two people seriously injured, according to local authorities.A man was taken to hospital in critical condition after being injured at Manly beach on Monday evening, New South Wales Police said in a statement.Hours earlier, an 11-year-old surfer had to be assisted off Sydney's Dee Why Beach after a suspected shark bit his surfboard, with the local council urging swimmers and surfers to be cautious.The first incident saw a 12-year-old boy taken to hospital with critical injuries after he was attacked by a large shark while swimming in Sydney Harbour on Sunday afternoon, police said.The boy and his group of friends were jumping off a six-metre rock ledge at Shark Beach, in the Sydney suburb of Vaucluse, when the attack happened on Sunday.Despite its name, shark attacks are rare at Shark Beach, a popular swimming spot.The boy was pulled out of the water by his friends before rescuers arrived. Police said it was their actions that had given him a shot at survival, local media reported. He is currently in intensive care.\"The actions of his mates... have been nothing but brave. [It was] a gallant recovery,\" said Joseph McNulty, who leads the state of New South Wales' marine area command.\"Very confronting injuries for those boys to see, but I suppose that's mateship.\"Marine police arrived to a \"horrendous scene\", McNulty told reporters. They pulled the boy onto a police speedboat and used tourniquets to try and stop the bleeding from his legs. They also tried to resuscitate the boy as the boat made its way to an ambulance waiting by a wharf.Authorities believe the boy was attacked by a bull shark, an aggressive species found in warm, shallow waters. Many experts consider bull sharks among the most dangerous sharks in the world.McNulty believes heavy rainfall over the weekend and brackish water conditions could have created a \"perfect storm environment\" for Sunday's attack. Rain flushes nutrients into the rivers and oceans which can draw sharks closer to shore. The final attack, in Sydney's Northern Beaches, prompted police to close all beaches in the area until further notice.According to police, emergency services were alerted to the third attack after a surfer was pulled from the water at North Steyne Beach, Manly, at 18:20 local time (07:20 GMT). He had suffered serious injuries to his legs, and was rushed to hospital.Australia, which is home to some of the world's best beaches, is also one of the deadliest places for shark attacks. There were at least five fatal shark attacks in the country last year.",

    "body": "The lawyers of the owners of a Swiss bar where a deadly fire broke out on New Year's Eve killing 40 people and injuring 116 have broken their silence to criticise \"lies\" about their clients. Jessica and Jacques Moretti were  \"devastated\", the lawyers told local media, but denied being aware of any dangers at their venue.\"There is a sort of public vindictiveness directed against them,\" one of the three lawyers, Yaël Hayat, said.Initial findings from the investigation suggest the fire began as sparklers attached to champagne bottles ignited soundproof foaming that lined the ceiling of the basement of Le Constellation bar in the popular ski resort of Crans-Montana. Authorities have acknowledged that the bar had not undergone safety checks for five years.Most of the victims of the fire were young - eight were under the age of 16 - and many are being treated in hospital for severe burns.Many stories about the couple, the venue they managed, as well as their past have circulated in the local media since the fire, increasing pressure on the authorities as they investigate the accident and prosecute the owners.In an interview with Tribune de Geneve, the lawyers said the couple wanted to \"restore the truth\".Hayat said reports her client Jessica had left the burning building with cash from the register were a lie, telling BFMTV: \"In no way did she leave the scene in a hurry; she stayed there to help and support the injured.\"Patrick Michod, representing Jacques Moretti, said: \"When you run an establishment and a tragedy like this occurs, you feel responsible. Now, the major question in this case is the question of criminal responsibility, which is obviously not the same thing as the feelings one may have as the operator.\"Asked about the foam in the ceiling, Michod said his client obtained the material from a \"major construction retailer\" which did not disclose that it was flammable. \"He did not want to install a highly flammable foam. He wanted to install acoustic foam,\" he said. Lawyers representing the family of Cyane Panine, a staff member at Le Constellation who died in the blaze, said she had received no safety training and was unaware of the danger posed by the ceiling that caught fire. Hayat described Panine as a close friend of the couple, and pulled out a postcard she said had been written by her to the Morettis, Tribune de Geneve reported. \"I hope I will continue to grow alongside you and that we will spend many more New Year's Eves together [...] you are like my second family,\" the postcard said.The Moretti couple have been accused by authorities of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.Last week, a Swiss court imposed a travel ban on Jessica Moretti as an alternative to pre-trial detention. She has had to surrender her passport and must report to police every day.She previously told reporters that she was sorry about the \"unthinkable tragedy\".Jacques Moretti is being held in custody for an initial period of 90 days. Prosecutors have also argued the couple present a flight risk and have asked judges to impose a 400,000-franc bail ($500,000; £374,000)as a condition for their release - 200,000 for each.Michod said that he had filed a request to release Jacques Moretti.

The blast happened at around 15:00 local time (07:00 GMT) Sunday at Baogang United Steel plant in Inner Mongolia, causing noticeable tremors in the area.Footage online showed the explosion sending large plumes of smoke into the sky, while the ground was littered with debris, including collapsed ceilings and pipes. Five among the dozens hospitalised suffered serious injuries, state media reported. Authorities are investigating the cause of the blast.Baogang United Steel is a major state-owned iron and steel enterprise.China has a long history of industrial accidents, from factory explosions and mine collapses to mudslides.In 2015, two massive explosions in the port of Tianjin killed 173 people, leaving hundreds more injured and devastating large areas of the city.In May last year, an explosion in a chemical plant in the eastern province of Shandong killed five people and injured at least 19.

    "body": "44 minutes agoSofia Ferreira SantosandAlicia CurryReutersAt least 39 people have died and dozens more have been injured after two high-speed trains collided in southern Spain, the country's Civil Guard has said.The incident near the city of Córdoba has been described by local officials as Spain's worst rail crash in more than a decade.Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez visited the scene on Monday, where he announced a three-day mourning period.Here's what we know about the incident so far.Follow live updatesWhere did the crash happen?The crash occurred at around 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT) on Sunday, about an hour after one of the trains departed Málaga for Madrid.The train derailed and crossed over to the opposite track, operator Adif said.It then collided with an oncoming train travelling from south Madrid to Huelva, which was forced into an embankment running alongside the track, Spain's Transport Minister Óscar Puente said on Sunday. The majority of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the Huelva-bound train, he added.What caused the crash?What caused the train to derail remains unclear. Officials say an investigation has been launched but it is not expected to determine what happened for at least a month.Puente has described the crash as \"extremely strange\" and said all the railway experts consulted by the government \"are extremely baffled by the accident\".The president of Spain's state-owned rail operator, Renfe, said he had \"discarded\" the possibility that the incident occured due to excessive speed or human error.Álvaro Fernández Heredia told Spain's national radio RNE that even if a mistake had been made, a system within the train would have fixed it.He added that both trains were travelling under the maximum speed limit on the stretch of track where the crash happened. Fernández Heredia suggested a mechanical fault or an infrastructure issue was a more likely cause.Meanwhile, at a news conference during his visit to Adamuz, Prime Minister Sánchez vowed to uncover the cause of the crash and thanked emergency workers  for their help \"in a moment of such pain and tragedy\".Are people still trapped in the trains?Spanish Guardia Civil / Handout via ReutersThe Spanish Civil Guard arrived on scene to assess the situation and begin the evaluation processThere were around 400 passengers and staff on the two trains, operated by Iryo and Renfe, according to a statement from Renfe.It is not clear if there are people still trapped inside the carriages but rescue teams are on site. \"The problem is that the carriages are twisted, so the metal is twisted with the people inside,\" Francisco Carmona, head of firefighters in Córdoba, told Spanish public broadcaster RTVE.\"We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work,\" he added.The president of the Andalusian regional government, Juanma Moreno, told local outlet Canal Sur that they are waiting for \"heavy machinery\" to \"practically lift\" parts of the second train, which \"has taken the worst part of this accident\".\"Until the heavy machinery can do its job and free the wagons from the track\", emergency services will not be able to start \"searching and identifying\" any remaining victims, he added.Who are the victims?The 39 victims of the crash have not yet been identified, with Puente saying the death toll \"is not yet final\" as investigations into the crash commence.As of Monday afternoon, 122 people had received medical assistance, 48 of whom remained hospitalised, local emergency services said.Among the 48 victims still in hospital, five are under the age of 18.Moreno said teams are working to identify those who have died. What have the survivors said?ReutersA help centre for affected families of missing people was set up in the town of AdamuzPassengers on board the Madrid-bound train described the moment of impact feeling like an \"earthquake\" and said it shattered the train's windows, displaced luggage and threw people to the floor. \"I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed,\" journalist Salvador Jimenez told Canal Sur.\"There were people screaming, calling for doctors,\" he added.Another passenger, Lucas Meriako, told Spanish broadcaster La Sexta Noticias he was in the fifth carriage of the same train when he started to \"feel some banging\" that got louder and louder.\"Another train passed us and everything started vibrating. There was a jolt behind us and the feeling that the whole train was going to fall apart,\" he described.",

Boric said the death toll was expected to increase.The most dangerous fire has swept through dry forests bordering the coastal city of Concepción. About 250 homes have been destroyed, disaster officials said.Local media have shown pictures of charred cars in the streets.Chile's forestry agency, Conaf, said firefighters were battling 24 fires across the country on Sunday. The most threatening, it added, were in Ñuble and Biobío.The fires have burnt through 8,500 hectares (21,000 acres) in the two regions so far.\"In light of the serious ongoing wildfires, I have decided to declare a state of catastrophe\" in the two regions, Boric said in a post on X.\"All resources are available,\" he added.Under a state of catastrophe, Chile's armed forces can be deployed to help.The bulk of the evacuations were carried out in the cities of Penco and Lirquen, just north of Concepción, which have a combined population of 60,000.Strong winds have fanned the flames, exacerbated by high summer temperatures, endangering communities and hampering firefighting efforts.Much of Chile is under heat alerts, with temperatures expected to reach 38C between Santiago and Biobío in the coming days.Chile has experienced a series of devastating fires in recent years, worsened by long-term drought.Two years ago, forest fires killed at least 120 people in the Valparaíso region near Santiago.",

    "body": "19 hours agoNick BeakeEurope correspondent, in BrusselsIt's not yet a full year since European leaders buckled up for President Trump's second term, and now this rollercoaster ride feels it has reached its most dangerous turn yet.The occupant on the White House is dangling the threat of economic punishment over the heads of countries that are supporting the territorial integrity of an EU member, Denmark. Leaders will hold an emergency EU summit about this in the coming days. If the European Union fights back with similar countermeasures, then it risks a full-blown trade war with the US.If it doesn't take action, will Trump conclude the bloc of 27 is weak, divided and too scared to stop him carrying out his threat of obtaining Greenland – either by buying or taking it with military force?French President Emmanuel Macron says it's time to use the EU's \"trade bazooka\" for the first time. This is the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), which would allow Europe to hit back with counter-tariffs, restrict access to the Single Market and block applications for lucrative EU contracts.There is a great irony that this weapon was originally designed to combat any bullying interference from a hostile external power.They were thinking of China, not the US.In the here and now, some EU leaders are wary of the Macron approach. Among them is Italy's Giorgia Meloni, who has enjoyed a better-than-most rapport with Trump.She has spoken of a \"problem of understanding and communication\" over the recent sending of troops to Greenland by some European countries, including Denmark, but hasn't expanded on what may have been misunderstood.If the intention was to placate Trump and suggest he is absolutely right that Arctic security must be stepped up, the sight of those soldiers only seemed to provoke him into making his latest threat.Meloni's explanation of something lost in translation opens the door to a more diplomatic approach to tackling this precarious EU-US crisis.Sunday's emergency meeting in Brussels of EU ambassadors was a discreet affair, unlike the routine top level summits where the traffic stops, roads are closed and leaders stream towards the cameras to deliver their thoughts.It's not clear who will make the next move and whether Trump will take some heat out of his latest threat or in fact double down on it.EU action on something so sensitive is unlikely to be swift and unanimous.Europe has tried to placate President Trump in his second term as best they can. Some have called it shrewd, others sycophantic.But now, there's a distinct feeling he's not just pulling up the Transatlantic diplomatic drawbridge, but is threatening to blow it up altogether.",

    "body": "2 hours agoMallory MoenchREUTERS/Kevin LamarqueUS President Donald Trump has said he no longer feels obliged to think only of peace after he did not receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as he again repeated his demand for control of Greenland.In a message to Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, Trump blamed the country for not giving him the prize. In his reply to Trump, Støre explained that an independent committee, not the government of Norway, awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in October to Venezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado.CBS News, the BBC's US partner, confirmed the message and its contents.\"Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper' for the US\", Trump said in the message obtained by US media.\"The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland,\" he added.Prime Minister Støre said he had received the text message on Sunday in response to a text he and Finland's president Alexander Stubb had sent to Trump.Støre said they had conveyed opposition to proposed tariff increases over the Greenland dispute, and pointed to the need to de-escalate, proposing a three-way phone call the same day.Trump has made no secret of his desire to be awarded the annual prize. He has increasingly insisted that the US needs to take over Greenland for national security reasons. The sparsely-populated but resource-rich Arctic island is well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region.Trump has repeated that he wants the US to buy Greenland and has not ruled out using military force against a member of the Nato security alliance to take it. Over the weekend, he said he would impose a 10% tariff on goods from eight Nato allies starting in February if they oppose his proposed takeover, and threatened to raise it to 25% by June.In his message to Støre, Trump said Denmark cannot protect Greenland from Russia or China, and questioned \"why do they have a \"right of ownership\" anyway? There are no written documents, it's only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also\". \"I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States,\" he concluded.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said on Monday that any decision about the future status of Greenland \"belongs to the people of Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark alone\", and called the use of tariffs against allies \"wrong\".Danish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen and Greenlandic Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Motzfeldt are due to meet on Monday with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte.Last week, the Danish and Greenlandic governments, together with Nato allies, decided to increase military presence and exercise activity in the Arctic and the North Atlantic.Several European states sent small numbers of military personnel to Greenland in a so-called reconnaissance mission.As Trump's recent message said, he has claimed to have ended eight wars since his second term as president began last year.The White House has previously listed these as conflicts between Israel and Hamas, Israel and Iran, Pakistan and India, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Thailand and Cambodia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Serbia and Kosovo.BBC Verify has examined Trump's claim which include a number of \"wars\" which had lasted just days, although were the result of long-standing tensions, and in some cases – for example Egypt and Ethiopia - there was no fighting to end.There has also been fighting between Rwanda and the DRC, despite the two sides signing a peace agreement.How many wars has President Trump really ended?The peace prize was awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado. Later, when US forces seized and removed Venezuela's president Nicolás Maduro from Caracas, accusing him of drug trafficking and other crimes, Trump did not endorse Machado as the country's next leader and instead backed Maduro's vice-president as the interim head of government. Machado, who has praised Trump, met him at the White House last week and gave her medal to him. The Nobel Foundation had said the award could not \"even symbolically, be passed on or further distributed\".What questions do you have about  Donald Trump's first year since returning as US president?

    "body": "Thirteen school pupils have died in South Africa after the minibus they were travelling in collided with a lorry south of the city of Johannesburg.The crash happened on Monday morning at around 07:00 local time (05:00 GMT) in Vanderbijlpark, the local education authority said.Eleven students died at the scene, while two succumbed to their injuries later on. Two other pupils remains in critical condition.The minibus driver crashed into the lorry after attempting to overtake two vehicles, police spokesperson Mavela Masondo said.Masondo added that a case of culpable homicide would be opened.The minibus driver was \"reportedly\" being treated in hospital, Gauteng province's department of education said, while the details of what happened to the lorry driver were \"uncertain\".Fatal road collisions are common in South Africa, due to factors such as rampant speeding, reckless driving and poorly maintained vehicles.In 2025, 11,418 people died in crashes - about 6% lower than a year earlier but still equivalent to an average of 31 deaths a day.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called Monday's crash \"distressing\". \"Our children are the nation's most precious assets and we must do all we can – from observing the rules of the road to the quality of service providers appointed to transport scholars – to protect learners,\" the president added.",

    "body": "China's birth rates sunk to a record low in 2025, despite the government rolling out a spate of incentives to boost it, as the country's population fell for the fourth straight year.Government data on Monday showed that the country's birth rate fell to 5.63 per 1,000 people – a record low since the Communist Party took power in 1949 – while its death rate rose to 8.04 per 1,000 people, the highest since 1968.Its population fell 3.39 million to reach 1.4 billion by the end of 2025, marking a quicker decline than the previous year.Faced with an ageing population and sluggish economy, Beijing has been trying hard to encourage more young people to marry and have children.In 2016, it scrapped its longstanding one-child policy and replaced it with a two-child limit. When that did not lead to a sustained upsurge in births, authorities announced that they would allow up to three children per couple in 2021.More recently, China has offered parents 3,600 yuan (£375; $500) per each of their children under the age of three. Certain provinces are also dishing out their own baby bonuses, including additional payouts and extended maternity leave.Some of these incentives have stirred controversy. For instance, a new 13% tax on contraceptives - including condoms, birth control pills and devices - has sparked concern about unwanted pregnancies and HIV rates.China has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, at around one birth per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1. Other economies in the region, such as South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, have similarly low fertility rates.China is also one of the most expensive countries in which to raise a child, according to a 2024 report by the YuWa Population Research Institute in Beijing.But some Chinese people have told the BBC they are hindered by other factors - including the desire for a carefree life without constantly worrying about their children.\"I have very few peers who have children, and if they do, they're obsessed about getting the best nanny or enrolling the kids in the best schools. It sounds exhausting,\" a Beijing resident told the BBC in 2021.Experts at the United Nations believe China's population will continue on a downward trajectory, estimating that the nation will lose more than half of its current population by 2100.A shrinking population has economic and social implications for the world's second-largest economy: exacerbating an already declining workforce and weak consumer sentiment. With many young people moving away from their parents, there is also a growing number of seniors who are being left to look after themselves or rely on government payments.But the pension pot is running dry, according to the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences - and the country is running out of time to build enough funds to care for its growing elderly population.",

    "body": "Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi will dissolve parliament on Friday, paving the way for an early election on 8 February that she hopes will translate her strong public polling into a big majority in the lower house.It was an \"extremely weighty decision\" that would \"determine Japan's course together with the people\", Takaichi told a news conference in Tokyo.The country's first female leader and her cabinet have enjoyed high public support since taking office last October.But her party lags behind in polls and the move is risky. It's Japan's second general election in as many years and will test appetite for her plans to boost public spending when cost-of-living is top of voters' minds.Having been elected as prime minister by lawmakers on 21 October, Takaichi is now seeking a public mandate in the House of Representatives, the more powerful house in Japan.Since the day she took office, Takaichi said, she has been \"constantly concerned that the Takaichi cabinet has not yet been tested in an election where the public chooses the government\".\"Is Sanae Takaichi fit to be prime minister? I wanted to ask the sovereign people to decide,\" she told the news conference.Campaigning for the vote to elect the 465 lower house MPs, who serve four-year terms, starts on 27 January.Her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has governed Japan almost continuously since 1955. It currently has 199 seats - including three held by its independent partners - in the House of Representatives, the most of any party. The LDP's coalition with the Japan Innovation party gives it a fragile majority, with just enough seats to govern. A protege of former conservative PM Shinzo Abe and self-professed admirer of Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi is known as Japan's \"Iron Lady\". She came into office promising an economic upturn after years of stagnation.Takaichi is an advocate of heavy government-led spending to drive economic growth - a revival of the sort of stimulus measures that Japan saw under \"Abenomics\". Her first few months in office have seen soaring personal poll ratings - no Japanese PM has been popular since Abe, in 2012.In December, her cabinet approved a record defence budget of nine trillion yen ($57bn; £43bn). This comes amid growing concern over China, with Tokyo describing its neighbour's military activities in the region as its \"greatest strategic challenge\".Takaichi has found herself the target of China's ire since last November, when she made comments suggesting that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan. The diplomatic spat that ensued has sent bilateral ties plunging to their lowest point in more than a decade.Meanwhile, Takaichi has pursued closer ties with the US. During US President Donald Trump's visit to Japan last October, the two leaders heaped praise on each other and signed a deal on rare earths. They also signed a document heralding a new \"golden age\" of US-Japan relations.Opinion polls show that while the LDP remains broadly unpopular among Japanese residents, Takaichi and her government have charted approval ratings of 60-80%.This popularity is what Takaichi hopes can help the LDP secure a \"sole majority\" in parliament and push through bolder policies more easily, Dr Seijiro Takeshita, a management professor at the University of Shizuoka, told the BBC World Service's Asia Specific podcast.\"She wants to solidify her position to make things smoother at a later stage,\" Takeshita said.But the snap election gamble comes with its own set of risks.The LDP's leadership has been on shaky ground, and Takaichi is the country's fourth PM in five years. Her predecessors' terms were cut short by falling public support and scandals.Her immediate predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, also announced a snap election shortly after taking office - leading to one of the LDP's worst ever results and costing the party its majority in the House of Representatives.Another challenge looms in the form of a new, consolidated opposition, the Centrist Reform Alliance, which was formed last week by Japan's largest opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, and the Komeito party, the LDP's former coalition partner.Takaichi said the dissolution of parliament was being carried out only \"after establishing a thorough system\" which ensures there is no disruption to economic policies affecting livelihoods and rising prices.What Takaichi is hoping for is that \"people will trust her to deliver on her promises\", Dr Jeffrey Kingston, an Asian studies professor at Temple University in the US, told the BBC.Her high approval ratings are \"only going to decline so she wants to lock in the benefits of a long honeymoon\", he added.",

    "body": "8 hours agoHarry Sekulich,BBC News,Guy Hedgecoe,MadridandRachel Hagan,BBC NewsFootage shows emergency workers at scene of derailmentAt least 39 people have died in a train collision in southern Spain and dozens more have been injured in the country's worst rail crash in more than a decade, Spain's Civil Guard has said.Carriages on a Madrid-bound train derailed and crossed over to the opposite tracks, colliding with an oncoming train in Adamuz on Sunday evening.Four hundred passengers and staff were onboard both trains, the rail networks said. Emergency services treated 122 people, with 43, including four children, still in hospital. Of those, 12 adults and one child are in intensive care.Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente said the death toll \"is not yet final\", as officials launched an investigation.Puente described the incident as \"extremely strange\". All the railway experts consulted by the government \"are extremely baffled by the accident\", he told reporters in Madrid.Follow live updatesRail network operator Adif said the collision happened at 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT), about an hour after the train left Málaga heading north to Madrid, when it derailed on a straight stretch of track near the city of Córdoba.The force of the crash pushed the carriages of the second train into an embankment, Puente said. He added that most of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the second train, which was travelling south from Madrid to Huelva.The type of train involved in the crash was a Freccia 1000, which can reach top speeds of 400 km/h (250 mph), a spokesperson for the Italian rail company Ferrovie dello Stato told Reuters news agency.Rescue teams said the twisted wreckage of the trains made it difficult to recover people trapped inside the carriages.Córdoba fire chief Francisco Carmona told Spanish public broadcaster RTVE: \"We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work.\"Salvador Jimenez, a journalist with RTVE who was on one of the trains, said the impact felt like an \"earthquake\". \"I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed,\" Jimenez said.Footage from the scene appears to show some train carriages had tipped over on their sides. Rescue workers can be seen scaling the train to pull people out of the lopsided train doors and windows.A Madrid-bound passenger, José, told public broadcaster Canal Sur: \"There were people and screaming, calling for doctors.\"ReutersPassengers were taken to hospital and advanced medical posts near the site of the crashAll rail services between Madrid and Andalusia were suspended following the accident and are expected to remain closed all day on Monday.Iryo, a private rail company that operated the journey from Málaga, said around 300 passengers were on board the train that first derailed, while the other train – operated by the state-funded firm Renfe – had around 100 passengers.The official cause is not yet known. An investigation is not expected to determine what happened for at least a month, according to the transport minister. Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the country will endure a \"night of deep pain\". The mayor of Adamuz, Rafael Moreno, was one of the first people on the scene of the accident, describing it as \"a nightmare\".King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia said they were following news of the disaster \"with great concern\".\"We extend our most heartfelt condolences to the relatives and loved ones of the dead, as well as our love and wishes for a swift recovery to the injured,\" the royal palace said on X.The emergency agency in the region of Andalusia urged any crash survivors to contact their families or post on social media that they are alive.EPAFriends and relatives have been seeking information about their loved ones on board either train.Advanced medical posts were set up for impacted passengers to be treated for injuries and transferred to hospital. Adif said it set up spaces for relatives of the victims at Atocha, Seville, Córdoba, Málaga and Huelva stations. The Spanish Red Cross has deployed emergency support services to the scene, while also offering counselling to families nearby.Miguel Ángel Rodríguez from the Red Cross told RNE radio: \"The families are going through a situation of great anxiety due to the lack of information. These are very distressing moments.\"ReutersThe foyer of the hospital close to the crash site, Caseta Municipal in Adamuz, filled with affected passengers.French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen have published statements offering condolences. \"My thoughts are with the victims, their families and the entire Spanish people. France stands by your side,\" Macron wrote on social media.In 2013, Spain suffered its worst high-speed train derailment in Galicia, north-west Spain, which left 80 people dead and 140 others injured. Spain's high-speed rail network is the second largest in the world, behind China, connecting more than 50 cities across the country. Adif data shows the Spanish rail is more than 4,000km long (2,485 miles).Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. Sign up here.",

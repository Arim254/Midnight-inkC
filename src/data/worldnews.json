    "body": "Actor Kiefer Sutherland has been arrested after allegedly assaulting and threatening a ride-share driver in Hollywood, police have said. Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said Sutherland \"entered a ride-share vehicle, physically assaulted the driver (the victim), and made criminal threats\" in an incident at 00:15 PST (08:15 GMT) on Monday. The victim was not injured in the incident, the LAPD added.Sutherland, 59, was released after paying a bond of $50,000 (£37,000). He is due to appear in court on 2 February. The BBC has contacted his representatives for comment.The incident took place at the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue in Hollywood and is under investigation by the LAPD's Hollywood Division.Sutherland, known for roles such as special agent Jack Bauer on Fox's 24, and as the US president in Designated Survivor, is the son of actor Donald Sutherland.The British-Canadian actor has been arrested several times in the past, and in 2007 he was sentenced to 48 days in jail for driving under the influence and violating probation.He was arrested for assault in 2009, although the charge was later dropped, and was most recently arrested after making an illegal U-turn in Hollywood in 2020.",

    "body": "Claudette Colvin, who helped end racial segregation in the US by refusing to give up her bus seat to a white person, has died. She was 86 years old. Colvin's protest, which led to her arrest, came in 1955 at the age of 15 while she was living in Montgomery, Alabama. It happened nine months before the arrest of Rosa Parks, who also famously refused to give her bus seat to a white person, in a move that led to widespread boycotting of public transportation in the city, and a Supreme Court decision that outlawed such racial discrimination. Colvin's arrest was largely unknown until 2009, when the first detailed book about her experience was published. \"She leaves behind a legacy of courage that helped change the course of American history,\" said a statement from the Claudette Colvin Legacy Foundation, which announced her death.One year after her arrest, the US Supreme Court ruled that segregation on buses must end. The legal case turned on the testimony of four plaintiffs, one of whom was Colvin.In an interview with the BBC in 2018, Ms Colvin recalled that she \"was not frightened, but disappointed and angry\" because she knew she \"was sitting in the right seat\".She was the first person to be arrested for challenging Montgomery's bus segregation policies, but her story remained relatively unknown for decades. It was Rosa Parks who became one of the main figures of the civil rights movement after her very similar case led to the large-scale boycott of the bus system in the city. Colvin said she had been inspired by the great anti-slavery campaigners Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth. \"Whenever people ask me: 'Why didn't you get up when the bus driver asked you?' I say it felt as though Harriet Tubman's hands were pushing me down on one shoulder and Sojourner Truth's hands were pushing me down on the other shoulder,\" she told the BBC.Later in life, she became a nurse in New York. According to her organisation, she died in Texas.",

    "body": "You must have heard of Dubai chocolate: the sticky, indulgent confectionary filled with pistachio cream, tahini and shreds of knafeh pastry, which has become a global sensation.Now the decadent bar has inspired South Korea's latest dessert craze. The Dubai chewy cookie has been selling like wildfire - and even restaurants that don't usually offer baked goods are trying to get a nibble of the market.Despite its name, the cookie's texture more closely resembles a rice cake, and is made by stuffing pistachio cream and knafeh shreds into a chocolate marshmallow.Shops are selling hundreds of cookies within minutes and the frenzy has sent prices of key ingredients surging, local media reported.This South Korean twist on the viral Dubai dessert first took off last September, after Jang Won-young from the girl band Ive posted a photograph of the chewy cookie on Instagram.While they currently sell for between 5,000 ($3; £2.5) and 10,000 won, prices are expected to climb due to strong demand. And apart from dessert shops and bakeries, other restaurants - from sushi bars to cold-noodle shops - are now offering the dessert. Local convenience store chain CU launched its Dubai chewy rice cake in October, and has sold some 1.8 million pieces of it in the last few months. \"Our manufacturing plant's production capacity cannot keep up with demand,\" a company representative told Yonhap News.So obsessed are the South Koreans with the cookie that someone even created a map that tracks shops selling the dessert, as well as their stock levels, in real time. Some stores have started imposing limits on how many cookies each customer can buy. The trend has also sparked online chatter among gig workers on whether hardware stores and cleaning companies should also start cashing in on Dubai chewy cookies, The Korea Herald reported.Such demand has driven up the price of pistachios, with local media reporting that a major supermarket chain has raised prices by 20% this year.Counterfeits have also emerged, spurring some consumers to call them out in their online reviews. \"I bought two for 11,000 Korean won, but there's no knafeh, and the exterior isn't marshmallow. It's heartbreaking,\" wrote one, in a review quoted by The Chosun Daily.Several food critics say the Dubai chewy cookies have taken off in South Korea because of how thick and dense they are.\"It reflects Korean food culture, where visual overwhelmingness matters more than balance or harmony of ingredients and flavours,\" food critic Lee Yong-jae told The Chosun Daily.

    "body": "21 hours agoMatt McGrathEnvironment correspondentA very cold start to 2025 and the growing power demands of data centres and cryptocurrencies saw US emissions of planet-warming gases rise for the first time in three years, a new analysis shows.Last year homes burned more gas for heating while the use of coal surged by 13% to meet rising electricity demands, the data finds.Although solar power also shot up last year, overall, greenhouse gas emissions went up by 2.4% after two years of decreases, outpacing the level of economic growth, according to estimates from the Rhodium Group.The authors say the policies of the Trump administration didn't \"meaningfully impact\" the rise in emissions but they expect this to change in the coming years.In the colder parts of the United States, most homes rely on natural gas and other fossil fuels for their heating.The low temperatures experienced in early 2025 saw consumption of these fuels increase by nearly 7% compared with the previous year.Extra electric power was also needed by the boom in data centres and cryptocurrency mining operations in places like Texas and the Ohio Valley region.The rising demand for power combined with the higher cost of gas was behind the 13% surge in US coal use last year. That was in marked contrast to both India and China, where coal use for electricity dropped 3% and 1.6% respectively as both countries added record amounts of wind and solar energy, according to an analysis for the website, Carbon Brief.\"The grid decided to meet that additional load this year, in part with renewables, in part with fossil but because of higher natural gas prices, there was some fuel switching that saw marginally more coal than there was in 2024,\" said Michael Gaffney, from Rhodium Group, the report's lead author. Other observers see the high price of gas in the US as closely related to continuing large exports of gas to the rest of the world.\"Higher natural gas prices means that finally, coal, which had been kind of driven to extinction by low natural gas prices, well [gas is] now so expensive that coal's worthwhile again,\" said Jesse Lee, from Climate Power, a US-based environmental campaign group. \"And that's what is allowing coal to make this comeback.\"Since 2007 coal power generation in the US has shrunk by 64%, with last year's rise only the second in the last decade.Last year also saw a slowdown in the rate of coal plant retirements, as electricity companies delayed closures to meet demands.So is 2025 the start of the revival of coal?\"It's more than just a blip,\" said Michael Gaffney.\"This is a response to the demand growth in the sector, a lot of it is coming from data centres, cryptocurrency operations, other large load customers, and that demand growth is here to stay.\"Solar power also experienced a major growth spurt in the US last year, rising by 34%, the fastest rate since 2017.Transport in the US, by road, rail and air remains the largest source of warming gases, with road traffic volumes increasing for the fifth year in a row.However, emissions from this sector were virtually flat in 2025 due to increasing numbers of hybrid and electric vehicles on the roads.Hybrids, in particular, showed strong growth, up 25% compared to 2024.While President Trump has been forceful in his determination to rollback the climate-related policies of his predecessor, and to boost US extraction of fossil fuel, Rhodium analysts who carried out this report say those changes made little difference in 2025.Some others disagree.\"There is a data centre explosion, that is somewhat independent of Trump,\" says Lee, of Climate Power. \"You could argue maybe his policies haven't all kicked in full blast yet, but I don't think you can really divorce his natural gas exports and his blind support of AI and data centres from this dynamic that's driving up emissions.\"Graphic by Mark Poynting",

    "body": "1 day agoSakshi VenkatramanandBernd Debusmann Jr,White House ReporterVenezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado will meet President Donald Trump on Thursday,  the White House has confirmed.The visit comes just weeks after Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was seized in Caracas by US forces. But Trump declined to endorse Machado, whose movement claimed victory in 2024's widely contested elections, as its new leader. The US instead backed Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's former vice-president.Machado said last week she hoped to thank Trump personally for the action against Maduro and would like to give the Nobel Prize to him. Trump called it  \"a great honour\", but the Nobel Committee later clarified that it was not transferable.Earlier, Trump had expressed displeasure over Machado's decision to accept the  Nobel Peace Prize, an honour the president has long coveted.Asked on Friday whether receiving Machado's prize might change his view of her role in Venezuela, the president said: \"She might be involved in some aspect of it.\"\"I will have to speak to her. I think it's very nice that she wants to come in. And that's what I understand the reason is,\" he said.Earlier this month, after Maduro's ouster, Trump had said Machado \"doesn't have the support within, or the respect within, the country\". \"She's a very nice woman, but she doesn't have the respect,\" he said.The US has so far backed Delcy Rodríguez  as Venezuela's interim president.Trump describes Rodríguez as an \"ally\", and she has not been charged by US officials with any crimes.\"Delcy Rodríguez and her team have been very cooperative with the United States,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday. But Machado has maintained that her coalition should \"absolutely\" be in charge of the country.Machado has said nobody trusted Rodríguez, telling CBS that the interim leader was \"one of the main architects... of repression for innocent people\" in the South American country.\"Everybody in Venezuela and abroad knows perfectly who she is and the role she has played,\" Machado said.The former legislator, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year, described US military action in Venezuela as \"a major step towards restoring prosperity and rule of law and democracy in Venezuela\".Rodríguez has rebuffed claims by Trump that the US was in charge of Venezuela.\"The Venezuelan government rules our country, and no-one else does,\" she said in a televised speech. \"There is no external agent governing Venezuela.\"",

    "body": "The death toll in a collapsed landfill in the central Philippines has risen to 11, authorities said. The landslide occurred at the Binaliw landfill in Cebu City last week while more than 100 workers were on site, officials said. Rescuers have so far pulled 12 injured people out of the debris, but more than 20 people still remain missing. One local fire official had earlier told AFP that was unlikely for \"people to still be alive\" three days after \"tons of debris collapsed over them\".But \"signs of life\" were detected in the debris during a search on Monday, Cebu City Mayor Nestor Archival told GMA News in an interview, adding that officials remain in \"rescue mode\".The incident has sparked calls for investigation into the cause of the collapse, as well as a review of the country's waste management system.Environment authorities have since ordered Prime Integrated Waste Solutions, Inc., the landfill's operator, to suspend its activities at the site.The company would have to \"submit a compliance plan within 90 days\", the local Department of Environment and Natural Resources said in a statement on Monday.The department also said it would conduct an investigation into the cause of the collapse and hold to account the responsible parties.Lawmakers have called for reviews of the country's waste management system and working conditions of waste workers.\"This should have never happened,\" Senator Imee Marcos, who has requested an investigation into the Binaliw landfill's operations, said on Monday. \"We have seen similar tragedies before, yet the same dangers persist.\"\"The lives lost in Cebu demand clear answers and real reforms.\"Bienvinido Ranido, who lives near the landfill and whose wife worked there, told Reuters that he saw people fleeing from the site last week, saying the \"garbage exploded\".\"I quickly took my motorcycle and rushed to the landfill. When I got there, I saw the collapsed building and it was buried by the garbage. I just screamed,\" he said. Rescuers retrieved his wife's body the next day.The Binaliw landfill is located on a piece of land measuring 20 hectares (49 acres) - three hectares of which are used for the landfill, Cebu newspaper The Freeman reported, citing the landfill's operator.While authorities are still looking into the cause of the landslide, a preliminary report from the local Mines and Geosciences Bureau points to continuous rainfall in recent weeks, which made the rubbish heavier, as well as other engineering factors, local media reported.Landfills are common in major Philippine cities like Cebu, which is the trading centre and transportation gateway of the Visayas, the archipelago nation's central islands.",

    "body": "Joshua Cavallo - the first man to come out as gay while playing top-tier football - has alleged he was pushed out of his former club due to \"internal homophobia\".Cavallo, who recently joined semi-professional English outfit Stamford AFC after leaving Adelaide United in May last year, made global headlines in 2021 when he came out with the support of his Australian club.In an Instagram post on Tuesday, Cavallo alleged that the Adelaide United officials had afterwards sidelined him due to his sexuality, something a spokesperson for the club said it \"categorically rejects\".\"All on-field decisions relating to team selection are made solely on footballing grounds,\" the club's statement read.In the Instagram post, Cavallo wrote that it had taken him a while to \"digest how my time at Adelaide United ended\" but said he was speaking out because fans deserve honesty.\"It's hard to swallow when I realised my own club was homophobic. I was angry because people thought I was sidelined based on injuries, when in reality, it was internal homophobia that kept me on the bench.\"A change in management meant \"politics\" kept him off the pitch and limited his career opportunities, Cavallo said, also alleging a photo of him and his partner was mocked by his teammates in a group chat.\"For the first time, I actually questioned if I should have kept my sexuality a secret.\"A spokesperson for Adelaide United - which is due to take part in its fourth Pride Cup match on Saturday - said it was \"extremely disappointed by the claims made\".\"Adelaide United has always been committed to fostering an inclusive environment for players, staff and supporters, and we remain proud of our ongoing work to promote inclusion across football.\"Cavallo has previously spoken about receiving death threats on a near daily basis after his decision to publicly come out, but has said that his only regret is not coming out sooner.While former professional footballers or those in lower tiers have come out as gay before, Cavallo was the first to do so while actively playing in a premier league.His 2021 revelation inspired Jake Daniels, who in 2022, at the age of 17, became the first British professional male footballer to come out in more than 30 years.",

The two leaders also exchanged signed drumsticks after their performance.\"When we met at APEC last year, [Lee] said it was his dream to play the drums, so we prepared a surprise,\" Takaichi later wrote on X.Footage of the jam session has won praise on social media.\"Music seems to have the power to connect hearts at a deeper level than words ever could,\" one X user wrote in Korean. \"Exchanges like this may be quiet, but they will surely help move relations between Korea and Japan forward.\"There have long been sore spots between the two neighbours, including historical grievances from Japan's colonial rule and territorial disputes.But both countries are allies of the US, and have worked together to counter China's increasing assertiveness in the region.On Tuesday, Takaichi said in a statement that cooperation between Japan, South Korea and the US has become increasingly important amid heightened tensions in the region's \"strategic environment\".Lee and Takaichi have also agreed to boost economic cooperation - a pledge that comes as China has been tightening its export of rare earths and dual-use goods to Japan.\"Just seeing them actually playing drums together - not just posing - looks like they are having so much fun, and that's what matters most,\" an X user wrote in Japanese. \"Both Korea and Japan are facing tough situations, but if we can meet each other halfway, I truly believe things will move in a positive direction.\"Lee's smoothness as a diplomat has boosted his approval ratings back home.Days before his viral jam session with Takaichi, he met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, with whom he took selfies on a Chinese smartphone.Last October, he flattered US President Donald Trump with a large golden crown. The only leader he hasn't been able to charm is North Korea's Kim Jong Un. Pyongyang has rejected Lee's overtures for peace and shown little interest in reconciliation. This week, Pyongyang demanded an apology from Seoul after accusing it of flying surveillance drones in its territory.Lee's rise to become president of South Korea had previously sounded alarm bells in Tokyo and Washington. Relatively unknown outside his own country at the time, Lee had a reputation as a firebrand who was sympathetic to socialist economic causes. The US feared South Korea would tilt towards China, South Korea's largest trading partner.Japan, meanwhile, feared a repeat of a spat in 2019, when South Korea threatened to pull out of an intelligence-sharing agreement after Japan tightened its exports to the country.That fight broke out after a South Korean court ordered Japanese companies to compensate the survivors of Japan's wartime forced labour, an issue Japan now considers resolved.Since taking office, however, Lee has walked a diplomatic tightrope among the region's major powers, from the US to China and now Japan.Lee heaped praise on Takaichi's drumming skills in a post on X, and likened their diplomatic efforts to the musical duet.\"Even if our timing was slightly different, our intention to find the same rhythm was shared,\" he wrote. \"In that same spirit, we will continue to build a future-oriented Korea–Japan relationship together, with one heart.\"",

    "body": "15 hours agoPaul GlynnCulture reporterScott Adams, the US cartoonist who wrote and illustrated the comic strip Dilbert, has died of cancer at the age of 68.His ex-wife Shelly Miles announced his death on Tuesday during a live stream of his podcast, Real Coffee with Scott Adams.The satirical cartoon strip - about a competent but frustrated engineer and his dysfunctional workplace environment - was first published in 1989, and went on to feature in more than 2,000 newspapers in 65 countries.The character also later appeared in books, an animated TV series and video game. But in 2023, his comic strip was cancelled by newspapers including the Washington Post after Adams was accused of making racist comments about black people.Adams called black Americans a \"hate group\" and suggested white Americans \"get the hell away from black people,\" in response to a conservative organisation's poll purporting to show that many African-Americans do not think it is OK to be white.He later defended his comments and said that he had been using hyperbole to make a point, adding that he disavowed racists and that media reports had ignored the context of his comments.US President Donald Trump paid tribute to Adams on Truth Social, following news of his death: \"Sadly, the Great Influencer, Scott Adams, has passed away. He was a fantastic guy, who liked and respected me when it wasn't fashionable to do so. \"He bravely fought a long battle against a terrible disease,\" Trump wrote.A tearful Shelly told listeners at the start of Adams's latest podcast on Tuesday: \"He's not with us anymore.\"She then read out a posthumous message from Adams: \"I had an amazing life, I gave it everything I had.\"If I got any benefits from my work, I'm asking that you pay it forward as best as you can. That's the legacy I want.\"Be useful, and please know I loved you all to the very end.\"In his later career, Adams - also a trained hypnotist - wrote self-help books including How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big, Win Bigly, Loserthink and Reframe Your Brain.He had been receiving end-of-life care at his home after the prostate cancer, which he first revealed he had in May 2025, spread to his bones.On 1 January this year, he told listeners that the chances of him making a recovery were unlikely. \"I'll give you any updates if that changes, but it won't,\" he said.\"So there's no chance that I'll get my feeling back in my legs, and I've got some ongoing heart failure, which is making it difficult to breathe sometimes during the day.\"However, you should prepare yourself that January will probably be a month of transition, one way or another.\"",

    "body": "A Republican lawmaker is vowing to begin contempt-of-Congress proceedings against former President Bill Clinton after he failed to show up on Tuesday to testify before a committee investigating Jeffrey Epstein.House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer told reporters he would start proceedings against Clinton next week, and could do the same against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she fails to answer questions on Wednesday.The committee had issued subpoenas for both Clintons to testify about the late convicted sex offender.  Lawyers for the Clintons called the subpoenas \"unenforceable\", and said they had already provided the \"limited information\" they had about Epstein. Bill Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein's abuse, and has denied knowledge of his sex offending. In a statement on Tuesday, Comer said the subpoenas to the Clintons were voted on in a \"bipartisan manner\". \"We communicated with President Clinton's legal team for months now, giving them opportunity after opportunity to come in, to give us a day, and they continue to delay, delay, delay, to the point where we had no idea whether they're going to show up today or not,\" he said. The Clintons contended the subpoenas - legal orders to provide testimony - \"are nothing more than a ploy to attempt to embarrass political rivals, as President Trump has directed\".     In a letter to Comer, lawyers for the Clintons said they had communicated \"proactively and voluntarily\" with the committee and that the subpoenas were \"untethered to a valid legislative purpose, unwarranted because they do not seek pertinent information, and an unprecedented infringement on the separation of powers\". Bill Clinton appears with Epstein and at the late financier's estate in photographs that were recently released by the US Department of Justice after Congress passed a law requiring the agency to release material related to investigations of Epstein.One picture shows the former president swimming in a pool, and another shows him lying on his back with his hands behind his head in what appears to be a hot tub.Clinton was photographed with Epstein several times over the 1990s and early 2000s, before Epstein was arrested for sex-trafficking. Clinton spokesman Angel Ureña said when the photos were released last month that they were decades old and Clinton stopped associating with Epstein before his crimes came to light.A spokesperson has previously acknowledged that Bill Clinton took four trips with staff on Epstein's private plane in 2002 and 2003, and met with Epstein in New York in 2002. Clinton also visited Epstein's New York apartment around that time.Citing flight logs, US media have previously reported Clinton flew on Epstein's jet more than two dozen times, occasionally without his Secret Service detail.Congress has the authority to detain someone until they comply with a subpoena, send a contempt certification to the justice department for prosecution or ask a court to force compliance.\"If the court finds that the party is legally obligated to comply, continued non-compliance may result in the party being held in contempt of court,\" according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\"Where the target of the subpoena is an executive branch official, civil enforcement may be the only practical means by which Congress can effectively ensure compliance with its own subpoena.\"Criminal contempt of Congress is a misdemeanour offence punishable by a fine up to  $100,000 (£74,500) and imprisonment up to a year.Over the last year, lawmakers from both parties have pushed to learn about Epstein's associations with powerful people and passed a law demanding that the justice department release all  files from federal investigations into the sex offender by the middle of December. After the department only released a portion of the files, the legislation's authors - Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna - went to court last week and asked a federal judge to appoint a special master to make sure the government complies with its requirements.",

    "body": "4 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterThe US government has given chip giant Nvidia the green light to sell its advanced artificial intelligence (AI) processors in China, the Department of Commerce said on Tuesday.The H200, Nvidia's second-most-advanced semiconductor, had been restricted by Washington over concerns that it would give China's technology industry and military an edge over the US.The Commerce Department said the chips can be shipped to China granted that there is sufficient supply of the processors in the US.President Donald Trump said last month that he would allow the chip sales to \"approved customers\" in China and collect a 25% fee.Nvidia's spokesperson told the BBC that the company welcomed the move, saying it will benefit manufacturing and jobs in the US.The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security said its revised export policy applies to Nvidia's H200 chips, as well as less advanced processors. Chinese customers must also show \"sufficient security procedures\" and cannot use the chips for military uses.The H200 chip is a generation behind Nvidia's Blackwell processor, which is considered to be the world's most advanced AI semiconductor and remains blocked from sale in China.Chinese embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu told the BBC on Wednesday that Beijing has consistently opposed the \"politicisation and weaponisation of tech and trade issues\".\"We oppose blocking and restricting China, which disrupts the stability of industrial and supply chains,\" he said. \"This approach does not serve the common interests of both sides.\"Nvidia has been caught in a geopolitical tug-of-war between the US and China - two sides of a global AI race.Trump reversed the chip-selling restriction last July, but demanded that Nvidia pay a cut of its earnings from China to the US government.Beijing then reportedly ordered its tech companies to boycott Nvidia's China-bound chips and prioritise semiconductors made domestically. That move was designed to bolster China's tech industry, though experts have consistently said that the country's chips still lag behind the US.Throughout 2025, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang continually lobbied Washington to allow the sale of the firm's high-powered chips to China, arguing that global market excess is essential for America's competitiveness.Some officials in the US, however, have expressed concerns that the chips would benefit  Beijing's military and hurt America's progress in AI development.While Beijing is likely concerned about domestic firms becoming over-reliant on Nvidia, local firms will be eager to secure H200 chips - at least until homegrown alternatives get better, said semiconductor analyst Austin Lyons.Nvidia will also be happy to get any revenue from China, even if it comes at a lower margin due to the US government taking a cut of the sales, Lyons added.Trump's \"unique\" proposal to collect a cut of Nvidia's sales could also set a precedent for his negotiations in other trade tariffs, said Marc Einstein from Counterpoint Research.\"It will be interesting to see if this tariff model expands to other sectors.\"",

    "body": "15 hours agoJake Kwon,Seoul correspondentandKoh EweProsecutors have asked for South Korea's former president Yoon Suk Yeol to be handed a death sentence if he is found guilty over his botched attempt to impose martial law.A court in Seoul heard closing arguments in Yoon's trial, in which he was accused of being the \"ringleader of an insurrection\". The charge stems from Yoon's attempt in December 2024 to impose military rule in South Korea - an act that lasted just hours but plunged the country into political turmoil. He was later impeached by parliament and detained to face trial.Yoon has denied the charges against him, arguing that martial law was a symbolic gesture to draw public attention to the wrongdoings of the opposition party.Leading an insurrection - the most serious charge against Yoon - carries sentences of the death penalty, or life imprisonment. Under South Korean law, prosecutors had to ask the judge for either one sentence or the other.South Korea has not executed anyone in nearly 30 years. In 1996, former military dictator Chun Doo-hwan was given the death penalty for seizing power in a military coup in 1979, though his sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment.The prosecutors in Yoon's case argue that although no one was killed in his martial law attempt, Yoon's intent was no less violent. Closing their arguments at Seoul Central District Court on Tuesday, prosecutors said the former president had been motivated by a \"lust for power aimed at dictatorship and long-term rule\".\"The greatest victims of the insurrection in this case are the people of this country,\" they told the court.\"There are no mitigating circumstances to be considered in sentencing, and instead a severe punishment must be imposed,\" they said.Prosecutors had called to the stand the military commander who testified that Yoon had ordered the arrest of lawmakers during his abortive coup. They also presented as evidence the memo made by one of the planners of the martial law, a former military officer, containing the suggestion of \"disposing\" of hundreds of people including journalists, labour activists and lawmakers.Yoon's insurrection trial has been merged with those of two other senior figures in his administration, former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun and former police chief Cho Ji-ho. Prosecutors sought life imprisonment for Kim, and 20 years in jail for Cho for carrying out Yoon's illegal orders. There are five other defendants.Yoon was in court to hear the final legal arguments. He has argued that as president, he had the power to declare martial law. Yoon was quoted by Yonhap news agency as saying he had done so to fend off the \"wickedness that would ruin the nation\".Legal arguments were expected to end last Friday, but continued into Tuesday amid reports defence lawyers had delayed proceedings.The court is expected to deliver its verdict in February. Sentences sought by prosecutors are not always upheld in courts in South Korea.Yoon, 65, was removed from office in April, and is the country's first sitting president to be taken into custody. He has been detained for months while facing several criminal trials. Last month, prosecutors sought a 10-year prison term for Yoon for obstruction of justice and other charges related to his martial law attempt.On 3 December 2024, Yoon shocked the country - and the world - by declaring martial law over South Korea. He said at the time it was to protect the country from North Korean communist forces, but some saw it as a ploy by Yoon to get a grip on power amid domestic political woes.The short-lived martial law declaration sent South Korea into months of political turmoil, while Yoon became South Korea's first sitting president to be arrested and charged.South Korea's incumbent president, Lee Jae Myung, was elected in June following a snap election after Yoon's impeachment.Despite his downfall, Yoon retains loyal supporters in right-wing circles who see him as a martyr who dared to rail against the liberal Democratic Party led by Lee.",

Starting March 17, around 2,500 Somalis will lose their work authorisations and legal status, making them eligible for deportation.President Donald Trump has made it known he does not want Somali immigrants in the US, and has launched a major effort in Minneapolis to detain and deport people in the country illegally.\"Temporary means temporary,\" Noem said in a statement to the BBC. \"Further, allowing Somali nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interests. We are putting Americans first.\"Congress established TPS in 1990 to give refuge to people from countries that experienced war or environmental disasters. Immigrants with TPS authorisation are typically allowed to live and work legally in the US.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) told the BBC that there are 2,471 Somali nationals with TPS, and 1,383 people with pending applications. DHS responded to an online post about the announcement that the protective status was ending for those people with a Trump portrait carrying the caption: \"I am the captain now.\"Noem last month announced a surge of immigration officers in Minnesota, home to a large Somali diaspora community and where a sprawling federal fraud investigation found problems in the state's childcare industry, which the administration has linked to Somali immigrants.Jonathan Ross, an immigration enforcement agent, fatally shot US citizen Renee Good in her car last week during the Minneapolis operation sparking large protests locally and nationally. The Trump administration says the agent acted in self-defence but local officials insist the woman posed no danger.Trump has for months said he wants Somali immigrants to leave, saying they should \"go back to where they came from\" and \"their country is no good for a reason\". Trump also said the US would \"go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country\".Ahead of Tuesday's announcement, Trump also posted online saying \"FEAR NOT, GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, THE DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!\"TPS for Somalia was first designated in 1991 by Republican President George H W Bush, following the outbreak of civil war in the country, and has been renewed since then by both Democratic and Republican presidents.The Biden administration had renewed TPS for Somalia for the maximum 18 months allowed under the law, which are set to end in March.Over the last year, the Trump administration has moved to end TPS for immigrants from other countries previously deemed unsafe, including Venezuela, Haiti, Afghanistan, and Nepal.Those attempts have been challenged int he courts and in September a federal judge ruled that a move to end TPS for Haitians and Venezuelans was unlawful.",

    "body": "20 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorOrganised crime prosecutors on the French island of Corsica are investigating the killing of former separatist leader Alain Orsoni, who was shot dead while attending his mother's funeral.Orsoni, 71, who had been living in exile for years in Nicaragua, was a well-known figure in Corsica. It is thought he was hit in the chest by a single bullet fired by a gunman lying in wait as the funeral ceremony in the village of Vero ended on Monday afternoon.\"It would appear he was hit by a long-range shot. He died pretty quickly from his injuries,\" said Corsican prosecutor Nicolas Septe.\"We'd just finished burying Alain's mother - it was a moment of pain and grief,\" said Father Roger-Dominique Polge who had led the funeral service.\"Suddenly we hear a gunshot and Alain falls down dead. In the middle of a cemetery, after a religious ceremony, I ask where are we, what kind of home are we living in? It's as if Corsica is worse than Sicily - it's unimaginable.\"No motive is yet known but Orsoni was for decades a high-profile figure in Corsican society and his graveyard murder in his native village shines a light on the criminal clans that have blighted the island.The investigation into his murder is being handled by a newly created national anti-organised crime prosecutor alongside the Marseille-based specialised regional crime office.A police source told Le Monde newspaper there were similarities with recent gangland killings targeting people linked to Orsoni's son, Guy.In 2023, two of Guy Orsoni's associates were shot dead, both by a gunman firing from some distance away. Guy Orsoni is himself serving a 13-year jail term for the attempted murder of a member of the so-called Petit Bar gang in 2018.Alain Orsoni led a storied life in Corsica and abroad. Renowned for his good looks and rich singing voice, he became attracted to Corsican nationalism in the 1970s and took part in a gun attack in front of the Iranian embassy in 1980. Three years later his brother was kidnapped and presumed murdered.\"Father, brother and son all found themselves thrust over time into the heart of politics and criminal cases,\" criminologist Alain Bauer told Ouest-France newspaper.Alain Orsoni later founded the separatist Movement for Self-Determination (MPA), which won four seats in elections in 1992. He was unable to take up his seat because of campaign irregularities and later spent time in jail for a series of offences.Amid violent splits among Corsican nationalist leaders, he left the island for Central America in 1996, eventually returning to become president of football club AC Ajaccio in 2008.Weeks after his return, police thwarted a plot to kill him by the Petit Bar gang.His role at AC Ajaccio ended in 2015 but he returned as club president in 2022, before returning to exile in Nicaragua and then resigning from his post in September last year.He was long aware of the risk to his life and, after the killing of four of his associates over a two-year period, he told Le Figaro newspaper in 2012 that he had bought an armoured car under pressure from his family after he was targeted in 2008.\"I'm not afraid of dying. I don't wake up every morning thinking I'm going to be killed. I live a normal life, without a squad of bodyguards,\" he said.\"I'm portrayed as a godfather, even though I don't even own a business on Corsica. As former head of a nationalist movement for 15 years I wasn't exactly a saint. But to depict me as a dangerous wheeler-dealer? That's a joke.\"",

    "body": "US Senator Mark Kelly has sued Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, arguing that the Pentagon illegally tried to demote him in retaliation for criticising the Trump administration.Kelly, a former Navy captain, drew the ire of Hegseth and President Donald Trump after he filmed a video that told military personnel they could refuse unlawful orders.Trump accused Kelly of \"sedition\", and Hegseth said he would open proceedings to lower Kelly's retirement grade, which could result in a reduction in his pay.The actions violated Kelly's right to free speech and due process, and did not follow military procedure, his case alleges. The defence department was \"aware of the litigation,\" a spokesperson said.\"As a matter of policy, the Department does not comment on ongoing litigation,\" the spokesperson said.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Kelly had a prominent career as an astronaut before being elected to the US Senate for Arizona in 2020. He also founded a gun safety group along with his wife, former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head at an event in 2011 and survived.He staked out a position as a centrist Democrat focused on defence, and has criticised Trump's use of National Guard troops to patrol US cities. Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, Portland, Washington DC, and elsewhere has sparked major court battles. The Trump administration argues that the forces are necessary to suppress crime, and to protect federal immigration agents as they conduct sweeps in major US cities.In November, Kelly, along with five other Democrats, filmed a video that told military personnel: \"Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders.\"The video irked Trump, who posted \"LOCK THEM UP???\" on Truth Social. The president's account also reshared another user's post, that read, \"HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!\"Trump later clarified to Fox News: \"I'm not threatening death, but I think they're in serious trouble.\"Hegseth then announced he would open retirement-grade determination proceedings against Kelly and issue a formal letter of censure. He described Kelly's comments as \"seditious in nature\" and a violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.The case filed by Kelly argues that Hegseth \"is disciplining Senator Kelly solely for the content and viewpoint of his political speech\".Kelly also alleges that Hegseth did not have a legal basis to open a review of Kelly's retirement grade.\"Nothing in the statute authorizes the Department of Defense to reopen that determination based on post-retirement political speech - and if it did, it would raise serious constitutional concerns and subject all of the nation's retired veterans to an ever-present threat against their retirement,\" the case states.",

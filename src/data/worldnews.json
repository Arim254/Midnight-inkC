    "body": "6 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterGetty ImagesHello Kitty is a globally recognised brandThe designer behind Hello Kitty is stepping down after 46 years, during which time she oversaw the feline character achieving world recognition.Yuko Yamaguchi took over design duties for the character - who isn't actually a cat, but a little girl from London - in 1980, five years after she first launched.Hello Kitty was immediately popular in Japan, but over Yamaguchi's four-decade tenure it has become one of the most lucrative franchises in the world.Sanrio, the firm behind Hello Kitty, said Yamaguchi had \"passed the baton to the next generation\" as it thanked her for her work.Hello Kitty launched as the Japanese 'kawaii' culture - a hyperfeminine, girlish aesthetic - gained popularity across the world.Yamaguchi herself often wore Kitty-style dresses in public and piled her hair in buns.The designer, now aged 70, \"has grown Hello Kitty into a character loved by everyone\", Sanrio said on its website.Getty ImagesYuko Yamaguchi was known to dress like Hello Kitty at eventsThe company said one of its other designers, known only by the pseudonym \"Aya\", had already been working alongside Yamaguchi and will take over by the end of 2026.Yamaguchi will stay with Sanrio to provide advice and support.The Hello Kitty character first appeared on a coin purse in 1980 and has become a global marketing phenomenon.She has appeared on clothes, accessories, video games, and even an Airbus plane. She has partnered with brands such as Unicef, Nintendo and Balenciaga, and has also appeared in float form at the Macy's thanksgiving parade.There are Hello Kitty cafes around the world and a theme park in Japan. Another park is due to open in China.Unlike other Japanese exports such as Pokemon, there is little backstory to the character of Hello Kitty. Sanrio has said she \"isn't a human, [but] she's not quite a cat either\". She was born in London and has a twin sister named Mimmy and a boyfriend named Dear Daniel, according to Sanrio.Kitty will make her cinematic debut in a Warner Bros film in 2028. She has already appeared in several animated series but has never spoken, as she doesn't have a mouth.",

    "body": "4 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorBloomberg via Getty ImagesPeter Magyar is ahead in the polls with less than two months to go before electionsLess than two months before Hungary's election, opposition leader Peter Magyar has accused his rivals of planning to blackmail him with a secretly recorded sex tape, and says he is filing a complaint with authorities.Magyar, who leads long-time Prime Minister Viktor Orban in the polls, said he suspected there were plans to release a tape of him from August 2024, when he says he engaged in consensual sex with a now ex-girlfriend at a party.He was responding to a photo recently posted online of a bedroom in an apartment dating back to then. Leading figures in Orban's Fidesz party said they knew nothing about the claims. The BBC has approached Orban's spokesman for comment.Magyar accused Fidesz of trying to blackmail him and made three allegations of unlawful conduct in a statement on Friday.Although no video has been published, he said one from that date would have been \"recorded with secret service equipment and possibly faked\".Magyar made no mention in his statement of the ex-girlfriend he had been with at the time of the alleged incident, although he said on Thursday he had accused her of extortion 15 months ago - an allegation she denied.She told Hungarian media that they were both victims regarding the alleged illicit video and she was ready to take legal action with him.Magyar accused Fidesz leaders of timing their campaign to coincide with the start of his nationwide campaign next week, and of trying to ruin the last week he was spending with his three sons ahead of the April election.Fidesz communications director Tamas Menczer accused Magyar of lying, while Orban's chief of staff Gergely Gulyas told reporters he could not comment on something he knew nothing about.Orban, Hungary's nationalist leader, has been in office for 16 years, but with parliamentary elections on 12 April, Magyar's centre-right Tisza party is at least eight points ahead in the latest opinion poll by Hungary's Idea Institute.Fidesz has so far focused its campaign on attacking the European Union, accusing Brussels of trying to bring down his government. He is seen as Vladimir Putin's closest ally in Europe and has called on the EU to stop sending money to Ukraine.On Friday, US President Donald Trump praised Orban as a \"truly strong and powerful leader\", ahead of a visit by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Trump said he had been \"proud to ENDORSE Viktor\" for re-election in 2022 and was \"honoured to do so again\".The election campaign is not even due to start until 21 February, but Magyar's allegations of dirty tricks are an indication of how murky the next few weeks may become.Magyar has built support across Hungary over the past two years, promising to reset relations with Hungary's European partners. A one-time Fidesz loyalist, he was once married to former justice minister Judit Varga, whose political career ended during a scandal in 2024. They divorced the year prior.",

    "body": "10 hours agoMichael Sheils McNameeFBIThe FBI has now confirmed that the masked man seen in the video is a suspect in the case The FBI has released the first physical description of the man believed to have kidnapped Nancy Guthrie, the mother of US news anchor Savannah Guthrie. Nancy Guthrie, 84, disappeared in the middle of night from her Tucson, Arizona home and was last seen two weeks ago. The authorities believe she was taken against her will.The FBI has analysed footage from a doorbell camera outside her home and believes she was kidnapped by a male who is between 5ft 9in and 5ft 10in (175-177cm) tall with an average build. It is first time the man in the video has been officially identified as a suspect in the case, which has drawn a huge amount of attention both in the US and abroad.The FBI said in its latest statement that it had been able to establish identifying details after carrying out a forensic analysis. It highlighted the backpack being worn by the suspect in the video, which was released earlier this week and identified it is a 25-litre Ozark Trail Hiker Pack.A pair of black gloves has also been found during the search for Guthrie, the BBC's US broadcast partner CBS reported on Thursday.FBINancy Guthrie was last seen on the evening of 31 January when family members dropped her home. Members of her church noticed her absence the following day and notified her family.Officials have warned that she may be in dire health without her medication. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said she was \"not in good physical health\" but had no reported cognitive issues.Since 1 February, the FBI said it had received more than 13,000 tips in relation to the case - including 4,000 in the 24 hours after the doorbell camera footage was released.It has now doubled the reward for information about Guthrie's disappearance from  $50,000 (£36,700) to $100,000. Getty ImagesThe reward for information related to the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie (right) has increased to $100,000Earlier this week, a man was detained in connection with Guthrie's disappearance and his home in Rio Rico - south of Tucson - was searched before he was released. He told reporters he did not know who Nancy Guthrie was.Savannah Guthrie and her two siblings have released a number of social media pleas directed at their mother's potential abductors. They believe she is still alive and have indicated they would be willing to pay for her return. ",

    "body": "3 hours agoMax MatzaGetty ImagesKathryn Ruemmler appears on a news programme in 2014Goldman Sachs' top lawyer, Kathryn Ruemmler, has announced she will step down from her role after months of pressure over her friendship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Emails disclosed by the US justice department show she referred to the disgraced financier in emails as \"Uncle Jeffrey\", advised him on how to push back against media and accepted luxury gifts from him.\"My responsibility is to put Goldman Sachs' interests first,\" Ruemmler, who previously served as White House counsel to former US President Barack Obama, said in a statement.Goldman CEO David Solomon thanked her for \"sound advice\". Her resignation will take effect from 30 June.\"Throughout her tenure, Kathy has been an extraordinary general counsel, and we are grateful for her contributions,\" Solomon said in a statement.\"Kathy has also been a mentor and friend to many of our people, and she will be missed. I accepted her resignation, and I respect her decision.\"There is no suggestion that appearing in the millions of documents related to Epstein that have been released in the US implies any criminal wrongdoing. But the drip of revelations became a public relations headache for the Wall Street bank, where Ruemmler led its reputational risk committee. She joined Goldman in 2020.Ruemmler said in a statement to news agency Reuters earlier this month: \"I got to know him [Epstein] as a lawyer and that was the foundation of my relationship with him.\"I had no knowledge of any ongoing criminal conduct on his part, and I did not know him as the monster he has been revealed to be.\"The BBC has contacted Ruemmler for comment.Emails show she had a large number of communications with Epstein between 2014 and 2019, when she was in private practice after leaving the White House.Epstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a child and died while in custody facing sex trafficking charges in 2019.In one December 2015 email exchange, Ruemmler wrote to a redacted recipient. \"I adore him [Epstein]. It's like having another older brother!\"That message came after Epstein offered to buy her a first-class ticket to Europe, according to the BBC's US news partner CBS.Her exit from Goldman follows the release of handwritten notes from a law enforcement official who participated in Epstein's sex trafficking arrest in July 2019.The notes suggest that, on the night he was taken into custody, Epstein called Ruemmler, whose mobile phone number is redacted in the documents.She has said she never represented Epstein as a legal client.Communications from March 2019, four months before Epstein's arrest, show Ruemmler advising him on how to push back against media scrutiny that his 2008 plea deal was too lenient.\"Far from [receiving] a sweetheart deal, Mr Epstein was subjected to a lengthy, aggressive, [and] highly unusual federal investigation for what were, in essence, local [offences] of sexual solicitation,\" Ruemmler wrote.She suggests arguing that Epstein was being persecuted due to his \"wealth\".The emails also show that Epstein lavished Ruemmler with gifts, including flowers, wine, a Hermès bag, $10,000 (£7,300) in Bergdorf Goodman gift cards and an Apple watch.\"Am totally tricked out by Uncle Jeffrey today! Jeffrey boots, handbag, and watch!\" Ruemmler wrote in a 2019 message.Last month, a Goldman spokesman played down the gifts, saying: \"It's well known that Epstein often offered unsolicited favours and gifts to his many business contacts.\"Ruemmler's departure is the latest corporate resignation linked to the latest Epstein disclosures.Last week, Brad Karp, the chairman of prestigious US law firm Paul Weiss, stepped down after emails revealed he discussed Epstein's 2008 conviction with him.",

    "body": "18 hours agoToby MannGetty ImagesJapanese authorities say they have seized a Chinese fishing vessel that tried to flee when ordered to stop for an inspection, in a move that may further fuel tensions with Beijing.The boat was in Japan's exclusive economic zone off Nagasaki Prefecture in the south-west when it was intercepted and its captain arrested on Thursday, according to the country's fisheries agency.\"The vessel's captain was ordered to stop for an inspection by a fisheries inspector, but the vessel failed to comply and fled,\" the fisheries agency said.The seizure is the first time since 2022 that the agency has seized a Chinese fishing boat. China has yet to react to Japan's statement. There were 11 people aboard, including the captain who is a 47-year-old Chinese national, the fisheries agency said. Authorities and Japanese media have described the seized vessel as a \"tiger net fishing boat\" with a high capacity.\"We will continue to take resolute action in our enforcement activities to prevent and deter illegal fishing operations by foreign vessels,\" Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said on Friday.Thursday's incident comes amid strained relations after Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi enraged China in November by suggesting Tokyo would intervene militarily if Beijing sought to take Taiwan by force.China has long insisted that Taiwan, occupied for decades by Japan until 1945, is its territory.It has not ruled out using force to achieve what it calls \"reunification\".In response to Takaichi's remarks, which China's foreign ministry described as \"egregious\", Beijing summoned Tokyo's ambassador and warned its citizens to reconsider travel and study in Japan.That led to a sharp drop in visits to Japan by Chinese tourists, and a subsequent hit to Japanese stocks related to tourism and retail.As the diplomatic spat deepened during the end of 2025, Beijing repeatedly demanded that Takaichi retract her comments, and its foreign ministry warned Japan to \"stop playing with fire\".Japanese artists touring China have also had shows cancelled and releases of popular Japanese movies have been postponed.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJaroslav LukivEPA/ShutterstockThe rules-based world order \"no longer exists\", the German Chancellor has warned at a major security summit.Opening the annual Munich Security Conference, Friedrich Merz told other world leaders that \"our freedom is not guaranteed\" in an era of big power politics, and that Europeans must be ready to make \"sacrifice\".He also admitted that \"a deep divide has opened between Europe and the United States\".The conference is taking place on the backdrop of US President Donald Trump threatening Denmark's sovereignty over Greenland by pledging to annex the Arctic territory and his tariffs on imports from European nations.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was listening to Merz and will deliver his own speech on Saturday, earlier spoke of a \"new era in geopolitics\".Some 50 world leaders are expected to attend this year's conference, where European defence and the future of the transatlantic relationship will be discussed.It comes at a time when US commitments to the Nato military alliance have been called into question. Trump's ambition to acquire Greenland has also been viewed by many European leaders as a watershed moment that has eroded trust with their biggest ally.Trump told reporters outside the White House on Friday: \"Greenland's gonna want us... We get along very well with Europe. We'll see how it works out. We're negotiating right now for Greenland.\"The Russia-Ukraine war, tensions between the West and China, as well as a potential Iran-US nuclear deal are also on the agenda at the annual gathering.Referring to multiple warnings that the rules-based order was collapsing, Merz told the conference: \"I fear we must put it even more bluntly: this order, however imperfect it was even at its best, no longer exists in that form.\"He also said that \"a rift, a deep divide has opened between Europe and the United States. Vice-President JD Vance said this very openly here in Munich a year ago\".Merz continued: \"He was right. The culture war of the Maga [Make America Great Again] movement is not ours. Freedom of speech ends here with us when that speech goes against human dignity and the constitution. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade.\"Last year, Vance attacked Europe, including the UK, for policies on free speech and immigration. His speech triggered a year of unprecedented transatlantic tension.But Merz did not write off the decades-long partnership, instead appealing directly to the US by saying \"let's repair and revive transatlantic trust\".The German leader also revealed that \"confidential talks\" were ongoing with French President Emmanuel Macron on creating a joint European nuclear deterrent. He gave no further details.France and the UK are the only two nuclear powers in Europe - but Germany and many other European nations have traditionally relied on the US nuclear umbrella within the Nato alliance for deterrence.Addressing the conference later on Friday, Macron reiterated his call for Europe to \"learn to become a geopolitical power\" in the new global context.He said Europe was already re-arming following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 - but stressed that \"we have to accelerate\" and work collectively across the continent.Describing the war in Ukraine's as Europe's \"existential challenge\", the French leader urged others not to \"cave in to Russian demands\" - but rather to increase pressure on Moscow to achieve a just peace.\"We live in a new era in geopolitics, and it's going to require all of us to sort of re-examine what that looks like and what our role is going to be,\" he said.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said earlier in the day that she planned to meet Rubio to discuss the US threats to seize Greenland from its Nato ally.",

    "body": "5 hours agoAnna LamcheandMarianne Baisnee,in ParisGettyA water leak at the Louvre has caused damage to a 19th Century ceiling painting, in the latest major setback for the Parisian museum.Water damage was discovered in room 707, also known as the \"Duchâtel\" room, late on Thursday night, the museum said. The room houses multiple 15th and 16th Century artworks.The museum said the leak - from a heating pipe - was stopped shortly after midnight and the only painting damaged was Charles Meynier's The Apotheosis of Poussin, Le Sueur and Le Brun.It comes a day after French police reportedly detained nine people - including two museum staff - over a suspected ticket fraud scheme.The Louvre said Thursday night's leak occurred at the entrance to the paintings department in the Denon wing.It said firefighters responded \"immediately\" and the leak was stopped 40 minutes after it began.A painting restorer inspected Meynier's ceiling painting on Friday morning and found it had \"two tears in the same area, caused by the water, and the paint layer on the ceiling and its arches has lifted\".The ceiling painting, signed by Meynier in 1822, depicts lauded French painters Nicolas Poussin, Eustache Le Sueur, and Charles Le Brun, who appear in the clouds among angelic figures.Rooms 706, 707 and 708 in the Denon wing on the building's first floor were closed on Friday morning, but are expected to reopen later in the day.The chief architect of historic monuments also came to assess the condition of the ceiling, the Louvre said, but found there were no structural problems.A union representative told news agency Reuters that scaffolding had been erected in the affected area.The cost of the damage to the painting and the building remains unclear.This leak is the latest in a long series of problems faced by the museum, which is the most visited in the world, in the recent past.The month prior, structural weaknesses prompted the partial closure of one of the galleries hosting Greek vases and offices.This came shortly after a high-profile heist on 19 October in which four burglars made off with historic jewellery worth €88m (£76m; $102m), exposing glaring gaps in the musuem's security.The brazen theft involved a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift, which was used to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine.A report published in October by France's public audit body criticised the museum's excessive spending on artwork, which it said was \"to the detriment of the maintenance and renovation of buildings.\"Musee du LouvreCharles Meynier's ceiling painting (pictured) suffered two tears and lifted paint due to the latest leak",

    "body": "11 hours agoMatt McGrathEnvironment correspondentTrump announces rollback of Obama-era greenhouse gas rulingUS President Donald Trump has reversed a key Obama-era scientific ruling that underpins all federal actions on curbing planet-warming gases.The so-called 2009 \"endangerment finding\" concluded that a range of greenhouse gases were a threat to public health. It's become the legal bedrock of federal efforts to rein in emissions, especially in vehicles.The White House called the reversal the \"largest deregulation in American history\", saying it would make cars cheaper, bringing down costs for automakers by $2,400 per vehicle.Environmental groups say the move is by far the most significant rollback on climate change yet attempted and are set to challenge it in the courts.Speaking in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said the 2009 ruling  was \"a disastrous Obama era policy that severely damaged the American auto industry and massively drove up prices for American consumers\".\"This radical rule became the legal foundation for the Green New Scam, one of the greatest scams in history,\" added the Republican president, about the Democrats' climate agenda.Former President Barack Obama, who infrequently comments on the policies of sitting presidents, said that repealing the finding would make Americans more vulnerable.\"Without it, we'll be less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change — all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money,\" he wrote on X. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) first took a stance on the impacts of greenhouse gases in 2009, in the first year of Obama's first term.The agency decided that six key planet-warming greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, were a danger to human health.With a divided Congress unable to agree on legislation to tackle rising global temperatures, the EPA finding became central to federal efforts to rein in emissions in the years that followed.\"The endangerment finding has really served as the lynchpin of US regulation of greenhouse gases,\" said Meghan Greenfield, a former EPA and Department of Justice attorney.\"So that includes motor vehicles, but it also includes power plants, the oil and gas sector, methane from landfills, even aircraft. So it really runs the gamut, all of the standards for each of the sectors is premised on this one thing.\"Trump administration officials are stressing that overturning the regulation will save more than $1tn and will help cut the price of energy and transport.Reversing the finding will reduce automobile manufacturers' costs by $2,400 per vehicle, the White House claimed.These regulations have been an economic strain, said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, who served in the US Department of Transportation during the first Trump term.\"The burden on the economy results in higher prices and manufacturing has left. It's gone to China, where it's made in a dirtier way,\" she told the BBC. \"So to say that we're reducing global emissions by ending energy intensive manufacturing in some countries, then having it go to China and India, where it's made in a dirtier way, does not reduce global emissions.\"Many environmentalists are sceptical of the potential cost savings being touted by the Trump team. \"It's going to force Americans to spend more money, around $1.4tn in additional fuel costs to power these less efficient and higher polluting vehicles,\" said Peter Zalzal from the Environmental Defense Fund.\"We've also analysed the health impacts and found that the action would result in up to 58,000 additional premature deaths, 37 million more asthma attacks,\" he said.For some in the US car industry there will be uncertainty about the rollback as manufacturing less fuel-efficient vehicles might limit their sales overseas.\"This rollback is sort of cementing things that have already been done, such as the relaxation of the fuel economy standards,\" said Michael Gerrard, a climate law expert from Columbia University.\"But it really does put the US automakers in a bind, because nobody else is going to want to buy American cars.\"While the reversal will help the White House to roll back climate change regulations, there are likely to be unintended consequences, according to some observers.While working on overturning the finding, the Trump administration also utilised the 2009 ruling to prevent states from passing laws that would be stricter on carbon emissions.The fact that the finding gave responsibility for regulating warming gases to a federal authority was also used to suppress what are termed \"nuisance\" lawsuits, brought by individuals or organisations on the climate question.\"The endangerment finding decision has blocked any number of lawsuits, and has been pretty powerful in keeping plaintiffs' claims out of court ,\" said Meghan Greenfield, now with Washington law firm of Jenner & Block.\"I would expect states and non-profit groups to bring suits, probably primarily in our state courts, to try to figure out where the contours of this new law are.\"John Kerry to BBC: Trump's climate change policy will 'cost lives'Challenging climate science One key argument about the reversal of the endangerment finding will be about the science on which it is based. The Department of Energy formed a panel of scientists to write a report last year challenging widely accepted science on the warming impact of greenhouse gases.That report underpinned the initial proposal to reverse the 2009 finding.But many climate experts complained that the panel behind the report was unrepresentative and filled with people who were sceptical of the human influence on warming, and that it was inaccurate and misleading.While it's not clear how much the Trump administration will rely on this report to face off any challenges, a federal judge recently ruled that the department had violated the law in the formation of the hand-picked team that wrote it.In fact, a challenge in court on the reversal of the endangerment finding may well be what the Trump administration is now looking for.Many legal experts believe that they want the proposal to be tested in the Supreme Court before Trump's term ends, believing that if they win, the endangerment finding will be consigned to history.\"This is really different as the EPA is exiting the space entirely and wants to do it on a permanent basis,\" Meghan Greenfield said.\"If they were to win that issue as they framed it before the Supreme Court, a new presidential administration could not change that position, in the absence of new legislation.\"",

    "body": "South Africa to deploy troops to tackle crime gangs10 hours agoWycliffe MuiaGetty ImagesSoldiers will be deployed to the Western Cape and Gauteng, provinces hard hit by gang violence and illegal mining respectivelySouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa said he will deploy the army to help the police fight criminal gangs and illegal mining in the country.Gang violence is a major problem in South Africa, which has one of the world's highest murder rates.\"Organised crime is now the most immediate threat to our democracy, our society and our economic development,\" Ramaphosa said in his annual State of the Nation Address (Sona) on Thursday.\"I will be deploying the South African National Defence Force to support the police,\" he added. In his address to parliament, Ramaphosa said he had directed the chiefs of the police and army to draw up a plan on where \"our security forces should be deployed within the next few days\". He said the military deployment would start in the provinces of Western Cape and Gauteng, home to the cities of Cape Town and Johannesburg, because of rising gang violence and illegal mining respectively.\"Children here in the Western Cape are caught in the crossfire of gang wars. People are chased out of their homes by illegal miners in Gauteng,\" said Ramaphosa. Authorities blame illegal miners, known as \"zama zamas\", typically armed, undocumented foreign nationals, for their involvement in organised crime syndicates.Ramaphosa ruled out deploying troops to Cape Town just two weeks ago, saying soldiers were trained for combat and not community policing. He did not explain why he changed his mind but there have been increasing calls for him to take action to tackle gang violence.Beyond the military deployment, Ramaphosa announced additional measures to combat crime, including recruiting 5,500 police officers, strengthening intelligence, and targeting crime syndicates.South Africa, the continent's most industrialised nation, has long struggled with entrenched organised crime.Police data shows that an average of 63 people were killed each day between April and September last year.More about South Africa from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "23 hours agoEmma Pengelly,BBC VerifyandGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianVantorIran has been fortifying an underground complex near one of its nuclear facilities, according to analysis of new satellite images.This activity comes at a time of heightened tensions as talks between Iranian and US officials continue, with President Donald Trump threatening fresh military action against Iran if it does not agree a new deal on its nuclear programme.The photos, first analysed by the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS), a US-based think tank, show tunnel entrances being strengthened at Mount Kolang Gaz La - also known as Pickaxe Mountain.Experts say this facility may be designed to protect Iran's uranium enrichment activities or key equipment, but its exact purpose - and whether it is operational - remains unclear.Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and denies it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.However, Trump said Iran was as little as a month away from having a nuclear weapon in June 2025, when he ordered strikes on three underground nuclear sites where centrifuges were being used to produce highly enriched uranium during a 12-day war between Israel and Iran last year.Trump said the strikes had \"obliterated\" Iran's enrichment capacity, but that Iranian officials \"were thinking about starting a new site\".Pickaxe Mountain was not one of the locations attacked in US and Israeli air strikes in June 2025, but the Natanz nuclear facility, located about 2km (1.24 miles) north, was hit.A satellite image from 10 February shows what appears to be fresh concrete laid on top of one of the Pickaxe Mountain entrance areas.A boom pump used to deliver concrete can be seen at the location, analysts from both ISIS and UK-based intelligence analysis firm Maiar agreed.At another tunnel entrance, rock and soil has been pushed back and flattened. There's also a new concrete-reinforced structure nearby.Experts at ISIS suggest these changes are intended to strengthen the tunnel entrances and give additional protection against a potential air strike.ISIS says the ongoing presence of heavy construction machinery and material indicates the facility is not likely to be ready for operations yet.\"In the past, Iran has tied the construction to rebuilding an advanced centrifuge assembly plant, but the size of the facility, as well as the protection provided by the tall mountain, raised immediate concern whether additional sensitive activities are planned, such as uranium enrichment,\" they said.Satellite images also show repair work and defensive strengthening has been taking place at the nearby Natanz nuclear site and at the Isfahan nuclear complex, 125km (77 miles) to the north, in recent weeks.At Isfahan, all entrances to its tunnel complex now appear to be sealed off with earth, satellite images reviewed by ISIS reveal..Backfilling the tunnel entrances like this would \"help dampen\" any air strike, ISIS says, as well as help to defend against a land-based assault to seize or destroy any highly enriched uranium that may be housed inside..ISIS has assessed the roof was added to block the view of anyone trying to observe what Iran was doing beneath it.Prof Sina Azodi, director of the Middle East Studies Program at George Washington University in the US, says Iran is \"operating under the assumption that the attacks are going to happen and they need to protect the facilities as much as they can\".\"[The] Iranian nuclear programme hasn't been destroyed,\" he added. \"Clearly once you have the knowledge and capacity and technology to reconstruct the programme, you can always rebuild everything.\"Rafael Grossi, the head of the global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, told the BBC a new nuclear deal between Iran and the US was possible and was urgently needed.\"My sense, talking to all those involved, is that we have a window of opportunity, but windows of opportunity have a tendency to shut themselves quite abruptly and brusquely, so I think the we need to seize the moment,\" he said in an interview at the Munich Security Conference.He also said he believed Iran's estimated 400kg of highly enriched uranium - which is a short, technical step away from weapons grade - remained in the underground tunnels and chambers where the US dropped bunker-busting bombs last June.Graphics by Tom ShielMore on this story",

    "body": "4 hours agoSimon Fraser,Asia digital editor, in London,andYogita Limaye,South Asia and Afghanistan correspondent, in DhakaReutersTarique Rahman has promised that democracy will be restoredThe centre-right Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has secured a landslide majority in parliament, 18 months after mass protests ousted the country's longest-serving prime minister Sheikh Hasina.The party took more than two-thirds of seats in the historic general election, with Jamaat, the country's main Islamist party, coming second. Hasina's Awami League was banned from taking part.BNP leader Tarique Rahman is set to be the next prime minister and faces huge challenges in getting the economy back on its feet and restoring democracy after 15 years of authoritarian rule under Hasina.Voters also backed sweeping democratic reforms in a referendum held alongside the election.\"I am grateful for the love you have shown me,\" Raman told well-wishers in Dhaka as he attended Friday prayers. His party said there would be no victory procession and he urged supporters to attend prayers instead of street celebrations in memory of his late mother, former PM Khaleda Zia, who died in December.His formal election as the country's new leader will happen after new MPs are sworn in, which is expected to take place on Saturday.Rahman's family background - his late father was also a leader of Bangladesh - is a reminder that while the BNP have promised change, Rahman, like Hasina, hails from a political dynasty.BBC at memorial for Gen Z protesters after landmark electionThe absence of both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, who alternated in power over four decades, was one of a number of firsts in this election. Another was that, with the Awami League banned, Jamaat for the first time ran as one of the main parties vying for power. The alliance it leads took 77 seats, six of which went to the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) born out of the 2024 protests. The Awami League has questioned the legitimacy of the election given that it was unable to participate, while Jamaat has questioned the way the vote was conducted. Both it and the BNP have accused the other of voting irregularities. For Rahman, it is a huge change of fortunes. He spent 17 years in self-imposed exile in London before returning to the country five days before his mother's death and is seen by many as largely untested. As well as being on track to become the country's next leader, is also his first time as an MP. He was elected as member for the Dhaka-17 and Bogra-6 constituencies, and is one of 212 successful BNP candidates, according to the Election Commission, which put voter turnout at 59.44%.During his campaign, Rahman promised that Bangladesh's democracy would be restored. Reviving the country's economy, bringing rising food prices under control and creating jobs for its huge young population are the big challenges facing the new government.Repairing strained ties with giant neighbour India is also high on the list of priorities.Within hours of his win, Rahman had received a call from India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi who congratulated him on a \"remarkable victory\".\"As two close neighbours with deep-rooted historical and cultural ties, I reaffirmed India's continued commitment to the peace, progress, and prosperity of both our peoples,\" Modi wrote on X.ReutersBoth the BNP and Jamaat have been criticised for a lack of female political candidatesAlthough the BNP are promising to lead change in the country, the party was criticised for corruption and accused of human rights violations when it was last in government in the early 2000s.Rahman himself was subject to various criminal investigations while Sheikh Hasina was in power but was later cleared of all charges.Thursday's democratic exercise is a moment of huge potential - and risk - for the country, with one of its two main parties winning such a big victory. Among the constitutional reforms envisaged are prime ministerial term limits, a directly elected upper parliamentary house, stronger presidential powers and increased judicial independence. Greater representation of women in parliament is also in the charter but only a tiny number of female candidates were successful in the election, showing there is a long way to go.Of the main parties, the BNP fielded 10 female candidates, the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) just two and the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami none.Both the BNP and Jamaat have denied sidelining women, instead claiming the number of those standing was a result of Bangladesh's \"social structure\".One voter, Shima Akhter, was among many women who took part in the student-led protests leading to Hasina's downfall - paving the way for the election - and dismissed this as \"just a patriarchal excuse\".Rahman will be under great scrutiny to deliver for Akhter and other young people like her who are hungry for change as Bangladesh has one of the youngest demographics in the world.While there may be mixed feelings among some about the election result and concerns over whether the BNP can deliver, Rashna Mahzabin is among those who are happy they got to \"raise their voices\" after years of authoritarian rule. \"That's a huge win,\" she told the BBC.Additional reporting by Azadeh Moshiri and Kathryn Armstrong",

    "body": "2 hours agoAhmed Nour and Abdirahim Saeed,BBC ArabicandJemma Crew,Business reporterReutersThe head of global ports operator DP World has left the company after mounting pressure over his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem's exit as chairman and chief executive comes after newly-released files showed the Emirati mogul appears to have exchanged hundreds of emails with Epstein over a decade.Being mentioned in the files is not a sign of any wrongdoing, and the BBC has approached Sulayem for a comment.DP World announced his resignation, \"effective immediately\", on Friday, naming Essa Kazim as chairman and Yuvraj Narayan as chief executive. A photograph of Sulayem appeared to have been removed from its website.DP World, the Dubai-owned logistics giant that runs port terminals across six continents and plays a significant role in global trade infrastructure, has come under increasing pressure over recent days from businesses it works with.Earlier this week, the UK development finance agency and Canada's second largest pension fund La Caisse said they were suspending new investment into the firm.And the Prince of Wales' Earthshot project, which received funding from DP World, was reported to the UK Charity Commission after Sulayem appeared in the files.The documents reveal what appears to have been a close and wide-ranging relationship between one of the Gulf's most influential business figures and Epstein.They indicate Epstein introduced Sulayem to various international figures from politics and business by email, and that Sulayem gave the Prince of Wales a tour of DP World's London Gateway port in 2016.Sulayem was also accused by two US lawmakers, Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie, of being one of \"six powerful men\" who were associated with the disgraced financier.The congressmen, who co-sponsored the law that compelled the justice department to release the Epstein files last year, say they were improperly redacted.Among the redactions flagged by Massie on 9 February was a document appearing to show an email from Epstein in 2009 referring to a \"torture video\".  The recipient replied that they would be travelling between China and the US. The context is not known.US officials disclosed that Sulayem was the recipient behind that email from Epstein.'Trusted friends'According to a BBC News Arabic analysis of the documents, the emails appear to indicate Sulayem appears to have been in contact with Epstein as far back as 2007.The trail of emails suggest the two developed a close friendship, regularly sending each other their travel plans, business ideas and contacts as well as news articles and crude jokes.Epstein described Sulayem as \"one of his most trusted friends\" in an email from June 2013.The men discussed business ideas around the world, including for Dubai to launch an \"Islamic\" digital currency.Meanwhile, in several emails over the years, it would appear Sulayem sought Epstein's advice on health matters concerning himself, his daughter and his wider family and friends.They apparently stayed in touch until at least 2017, two years before Epstein's death and despite Epstein's first criminal conviction in 2008 for soliciting and procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution.Emails about womenThe emails appear to indicate Sulayem and Epstein exchanged many messages discussing girls and women around them.The context of those emails are not always clear.An email apparently sent from Sulayem to Epstein in 2013 regarding the arrival of two women, disparaged the \"Moldavian\" as less attractive than her photo while praising the \"Ukrainian\".Four years later, emails appear to indicate Sulayem arranged for Epstein's \"private masseuse\" to be trained on \"all the treatments\" at a Turkish hotel. A contact from the hotel confirms back that she will be provided with \"an extensive training programme\".The email trail shows the woman confirms she is a Russian passport holder.In an unrelated email in 2015, Sulayem told Epstein that he thinks \"Russia is the source of all beautiful women\".Two separate emails, which appear to be from Sulayem, revealed he had an Irish and Uzbek girlfriend. In 2017, he boasts \"This my new 22 years old Uzbek\" to Epstein. Epstein corrects him and appears to make a comment about her age: \"According to her passport she is now 23, old\".His correspondence over the years with Epstein suggests he was married and had two wives at one point.On at least one occasion, Sulayem also appears to have forwarded his friend sexist and racist jokes.Mandelson told 'Be nice to Sultan'Lord Mandelson appears to have been lobbied by Epstein on behalf of Sulayem who was trying to push through a deal with the UK government that would allow his company to run the London Gateway port.In a previously-unreported email from October 2009, Epstein tells Lord Mandelson, who was business secretary at the time, to \"be nice to Sultan\".Email chains also indicate there was a meeting set up between Sulayem and Lord Mandelson weeks earlier to persuade the UK government to support the DP World deal.The documents also indicate Epstein had helped Sulayem draft a letter to Lord Mandelson and shared the business secretary's personal email address.It is not clear from the documents whether Epstein's intervention played any role in the eventual approval of the project. But the exchanges appear to suggest that Epstein was acting as an informal intermediary between Sulayem and senior political figures.There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Lord Mandelson in relation to the matter. The BBC has contacted him for his comments.In a later email, from March 2016, Sulayem tells Epstein he received Prince William at the London Gateway port, and the following day attended a function with him at Buckingham Palace. The emails show Epstein replied with the word \"fun\".Other introductionsThe documents include emails indicating Epstein introduced Sulayem to international figures from politics and business by email, including former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak and former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon.Subsequent correspondence shows Sulayem and those figures communicating directly via emails while copying Epstein or forwarding messages to him.An email purportedly sent from Sulayem in 2015 also inquired about if Epstein mentioned his \"proposal\" to Elon Musk. It did not provide further details.The disgraced US financier also offered introductions to the African presidents of Kenya, Senegal, Gabon, and DR Congo. It is not clear from the documents seen by the BBC if this offer was taken up.Sulayem also apparently sought Epstein's counsel in 2017 regarding an invitation to Trump's presidential inauguration. In the correspondence, Sultan asked, \"Should I accept the invitation,\" before inquiring whether it would be possible to \"shake hand with Trump\".In an email in 2013, Sulayem tells Epstein he has been invited by the then-Prince Andrew to lunch at a function he is holding for the president of the UAE who was on an official visit.Several emails show discussions about plans for Sulayem to visit Epstein's home in New York or his island in the US Virgin Islands. They also regularly updated each other on their international travel plans.",

    "body": "Sudanese city had 6,000 killed in three days, UN says2 hours agoNatasha BootyandRichard KagoeAFP via Getty ImagesSome have managed to flee to aid camps further north and westMore than 6,000 people were killed in just three days when Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) seized the city of el-Fasher last year, according to victims and witnesses cited in a UN report. \"It was like a scene out of a horror movie,\" recalled one person, who saw bodies thrown into the air as RSF fighters opened fire on 1,000 people sheltering in a university building last October.The RSF has not commented on the report but has denied previous such accusations.Sudan remains locked in an almost three‑year power struggle between the regular army and the RSF paramilitaries. The ongoing civil war has killed hundreds of thousands of people, and forced more than 13 million people from their homes.  Widespread sexual violence against men, women and children is being used as a weapon of war.Both the RSF and the Sudanese Armed Forces have been accused of atrocities.The US and Human Rights Watch believe the RSF and its allies have waged a genocide in the western Darfur region against the Massalit people and other non-Arab communities, but recent UN reports have stopped short of calling it this.El-Fasher, a key city located in Darfur, came under 18 months of sustained siege. It is where some of the most harrowing stories have emerged in this conflict.More than 140 victims and witnesses gave testimony in Sudan's Northern state and in eastern Chad in late 2025, according to the UN Human Rights Office.In those first few days of the assault on el-Fasher, the UN says \"at least 4,400 people were killed\" within the city,  and \"over 1,600 others along exit routes as they fled\". \"The actual scale of the death toll during the week-long offensive is undoubtedly significantly higher,\" the report adds.The UN Human Rights Chief, Volker Türk, has renewed calls on all sides in Sudan to end what he described as grave violations by forces under their command.International pressure has been increasing on the backers of this conflict to disengage. The UAE has denied widespread claims that it is the main supplier of arms to RSF fighters.Last week, the UK imposed sanctions on six key figures it said were fuelling Sudan's war - including senior commanders in the army and the RSF, as well as three foreign nationals allegedly responsible for recruiting Colombian mercenaries to fight for the RSF.\"The UK has extremely strong controls on arms exports, including to prevent any diversion. We will continue to take that immensely seriously,\" Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said in response.Plans to set up a rival Sudanese government baaed in the west of the country have been announced by a coalition linked to the RSF, called the Sudan Founding Alliance.The African Union has rejected those plans, warning that such a move would threaten any prospect of unity.More BBC stories on Sudan:To support children in Sudan and other Arabic-speaking countries who are denied or restricted from accessing education, the BBC World Service is launching a new season of the Arabic edition of its award-winning educational programme Dars - or Lesson.The first episode aired on Saturday 24 January, on BBC News Arabic TV. New episodes are broadcast weekly on Saturdays at 09:30 GMT (11:30 EET), with repeats on Sundays at 05:30 GMT (07:30 EET) and throughout the week.The programme is also available on digital platforms, including BBC News Arabic YouTube.Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

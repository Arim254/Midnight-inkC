    "body": "7 hours agoFan WangCostfoto/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesA Su-35 fighter jet - the model Australia says was used by the PLA in Sunday's encounter - seen at the 2024 Zhuhai Air Show in ChinaAustralia has accused a Chinese military aircraft of releasing flares \"in close proximity\" to its patrol jet over the South China Sea.The Australian government has raised its concern with Beijing over the \"unsafe and unprofessional\" manoeuvre, the defence department said in a statement on Monday.There was no damage to Australia's P-8A aircraft and its personnel were unharmed after Sunday's encounter.A Chinese military spokesperson said the Australian jet \"illegally intruded\" into China's airspace and had to be expelled. The Australian aircraft's actions \"seriously infringed upon China's sovereignty\", Senior Colonel Li Jianjian, spokesperson for China's Southern Theater Command Air Force said, urging Canberra to \"immediately cease its infringing and provocative actions\".Australia Defence Force said it expects all countries, including China, to operate their militaries in a safe and professional manner.This is the latest in a string of encounters between the two countries' militaries in the region, where China's vast claims over islands and outcrops overlap with those of its neighbours.Sunday's incident also occurred as Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was heading to the US for a meeting with President Donald Trump, where the two leaders are expected to discuss the Aukus - a multi-billion dollar submarine deal between Australia, the US and the UK. Australia has also accused a Chinese jet of dropping flares near an Australian plane in the area in February. China at that time said the Australian jet had intentionally intruded into its airspace and that its response was \"lawful and restrained\".While it has no claims to the South China Sea, Australia has aligned itself close to the US and its allies in saying that China's assertions have no legal basis.In May last year, Australia accused a Chinese fighter plane of dropping flares close to an Australian navy helicopter that was part of a UN Security Council mission on the Yellow Sea off the Korean coastline.In November 2023, Canberra accused Beijing's navy of using sonar pulses in international waters off Japan, which resulted in injuries to Australian divers.",

    "body": "Japan has for the first time approved over-the-counter sales of an emergency contraceptive pill, its manufacturer says, allowing women in the country to take the medication without prescription.ASKA Pharmaceutical said wider access to the pill would \"empower Japanese women in the area of reproductive health\". A date for it to go on sale has yet to be announced.The pill will be labelled as \"medicine requiring guidance\", meaning women must take it in the presence of a pharmacist.The \"morning-after\" pill is already available without prescription in more than 90 countries. Japan's conservative views on abortion are rooted in patriarchy and deeply traditional views on the role of women.ASKA Pharmaceutical said in a statement on Monday that it \"has obtained the marketing authorisation as a switch to OTC [over-the-counter] use of the emergency contraceptive pill commercialised under the trademark Norlevo\".There will be no age restrictions on buyers and no requirement for parental consent, the saily newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported.The company said it had filed for regulatory approval in 2024, following prescription-free trial sales of the pill the year before.During the trial, Norlevo was made available at 145 pharmacies in Japan. Until then, the pill had only been supplied at clinics or pharmacies with a doctor's examination and prescription.At the time, rights groups criticised the trial, saying it was too small, and called for restrictions to be lifted. Campaigners have long argued that requiring a prescription deterred younger women and rape victims from accessing emergency contraception.Selling the drug without prescription was first discussed by a health ministry panel in 2017 - the public consultation found overwhelming support across the country.But officials stopped short of giving it the green light then, saying that making it more easily available would encourage irresponsible use of the \"morning-after\" pill.Norlevo - and the generic version levonorgestrel - works best within 72 hours after unprotected sex and has an efficacy rate of 80%.",

    "body": "12 minutes agoTom Bennettin Jerusalem, andAlaa Daraghmein Ramallah, occupied West BankA 55-year-old Palestinian woman has been taken to hospital after being clubbed over the head by a masked Jewish settler as she was picking olives.The unprovoked attack, which took place on Sunday morning in the Palestinian village of Turmus Ayya in the occupied West Bank, was captured on video by US journalist Jasper Nathaniel.Mr Nathaniel said the settler knocked the woman unconscious with the first strike of his stick, before hitting her again as she lay on the ground. She has been named locally as Umm Saleh Abu Alia.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC the confrontation was dispersed after its forces arrived, and that it \"strongly condemns any form of violence\" by settlers. However, Mr Nathaniel said Israeli soldiers were on-site prior to the attack and had \"lured\" him and others into an \"ambush\". He said soldiers \"sped off\" just before the settlers launched the assault. The BBC has put this specific allegation to the IDF.At least 80% of residents of Turmus Ayya hold US citizenship or residency, according to Israeli media. The BBC has reached out to the US State Department and US embassy for comment.The young male attacker is seen in the footage wielding a large wooden stick with a knot at one end, reminiscent of a club, before he swings it overhead and strikes Mrs Abu Alia.\"It's the most vivid image that's ever been seared in my mind,\" Mr Nathaniel told the BBC.\"He swings it one time and I saw her body go completely limp. And then he stood over her and hit her twice more.\"The mother of five is then seen bleeding as she is carried into a vehicle to be taken to hospital. She was initially admitted to an intensive care unit but is now in a stable condition, doctors say.Her cousin, Hamdi Abu Alia, told the BBC that medical staff found she had been struck twice in the head. Amin Abu Alia, the mayor of the adjacent village al-Mughayyir, confirmed details of the attack to the BBC.The attack was part of a wider incident in which at least 15 masked settlers were seen hurling stones and attacking other Palestinians who were harvesting olives - as well as activists who had arrived to support them, including Mr Nathaniel.At least one car was torched. Others had their windows smashed.The assault comes amid a spate of attacks in recent weeks linked to the olive harvest, which officially began on 9 October.The harvest is an age-old ritual that forms a major part of Palestinian culture. It is also an economic necessity for many, but is increasingly precarious.Farmers across the West Bank - internationally regarded as Palestinian land occupied by Israel - face heightened risks during harvest season, including organised assaults and the use of force by Israeli security forces to block roads and Palestinians' access to their lands.Of the 71 settler attacks documented by the UN's humanitarian office, Ocha, across the West Bank between 7 and 13 October, half were related to the ongoing harvest season. The attacks affected Palestinians in 27 villages.In 2025, more than 3,200 Palestinians have been injured in settler attacks across the West Bank, according to Ocha.Attacks are intended, monitors say, to intimidate Palestinians and eventually drive them from their land so settlers can seize it. The vast majority go unpunished, with just 3% of official investigations into settler violence between 2005 and 2023 ending in a conviction, according to Israeli civil rights group Yesh Din. Many incidents are not investigated.Shortly after entering office, US President Donald Trump cancelled a range of sanctions imposed on Israeli settlers by his predecessor Joe Biden.",

    "body": "10 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThe 4.8% growth in the third quarter marked a slowdown from 5.2% in the three months to JulyChina's economic growth slowed in the three months to the end of September as problems in the property market persisted and trade tensions with the US flared up.The world's second-largest economy grew by 4.8% compared to the same period in 2024, its weakest pace in a year, official figures released on Monday show.The data comes after China imposed sweeping controls on its exports of rare earths - minerals essential for the global production of electronics - a move that rocked its fragile trade truce with the US.The third-quarter growth figures will set the tone for a gathering of China's top leaders this week to discuss the country's economic blueprint over the next five years.The latest growth figure marked a slowdown from the annual rate of 5.2% seen in the three months to July.China's National Bureau of Statistics said the economy showed \"strong resilience and vitality\" against pressure . It credited momentum in its technology sector and business services as key growth drivers.Beijing has set a goal of \"around 5%\" economic growth this year and has so far avoided a sharp downturn, helped by government support measures and what - until recently - had been a trade ceasefire with Washington.When China announced controls on rare earths earlier this month, US President Donald Trump responded swiftly by threatening an additional 100% tariffs on imports from China.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said he expects to meet Chinese officials this week in Malaysia in an attempt to ease tensions and set up a meeting between Trump and his counterpart Xi Jinping.Before the recent flare-up, Chinese businesses had taken advantage of the trade truce with Washington to ship goods to the US, resulting in China's exports rising by 8.4% in September. The total value of imports to China was also up.China's industrial output grew by 6.5% last month from a year earlier, with its 3D-printing, robotics and electric vehicles manufacturers among its strongest performers.Its service sector, which includes IT support, consultancies, and transport and logistics companies, also grew.Getty ImagesChina has been struggling with a property crisis since 2021The latest data shows that China's exports have helped to offset its \"sluggish\" domestic spending, according to Sheana Yue, senior economist at Oxford Economics.Beijing has spent billions on incentives such as subsidies, higher wages and discounts to encourage locals to spend more and lift its economy.However, Ms Yue said it was unlikely China's economic growth this year would exceed 4.8% without further government support, which could come with the new Five-Year Plan laying out Beijing's economic goals.China's property sector also continued to struggle as real estate investment fell 13.9% in the year up to September.The housing market is going through a sharp downturn, marked by falling home prices, shrinking sales and instances of developers abandoning their projects.The real estate sector accounts for about a third of the Chinese economy and has been a major source of income for local governments.Home prices have fallen in almost every major city despite government support measures, said economics lecturer Laura Wu from Nanyang Technological University.In the long-run, housing \"is still the major drag on China's economic growth\" even as it faces uncertainty from Washington's tariffs and other trade barriers, said Prof Wu.",

    "body": "7 hours agoJonathan HeadSouth East Asia correspondentThe Myanmar military says it has captured one of the most notorious scam compounds on the border with Thailand, as it reclaims key territory it lost in the ongoing civil war.KK Park, south of the border town of Myawaddy, has been synonymous with online fraud, money laundering and human trafficking for the past five years. Thousands of people were lured to the compound with the promise of well-paid jobs, and then forced to run elaborate scams, stealing billions of dollars from victims all over the world.The military, long tainted by its links to the scam business, now says it has taken the complex as it expands control around Myawaddy, the main trade link to Thailand. In recent weeks the military, or junta, has pushed back insurgents in several parts of Myanmar, aiming to maximise the number of places where it can hold a planned election, starting in December.  It still doesn't control large swathes of the country, which has been torn apart by conflict since a military coup in February 2021. The election has been dismissed as a sham by opposition forces who have vowed to block it in areas they hold.KK Park began with a lease agreement in early 2020 to build an industrial park between the Karen National Union (KNU), the ethnic insurgent group which controls much of this region, and a little-known Hong Kong listed company, Huanya International. Researchers believe there are links between Huanya and a prominent Chinese underworld figure Wan Kuok Koi, better known as Broken Tooth, who has since invested in other scam centres on the border. The complex expanded rapidly, and is easily visible from the Thai side of the border. Those who managed to escape from it describe a brutal regime imposed on the thousands of people, many from African countries, who were held there, forced to work long hours, with torture and beatings inflicted on those who failed to meet targets.A statement by the junta's information ministry said its forces had \"cleared\" KK Park, releasing more than 2,000 workers there and confiscating 30 of Elon Musk's Starlink satellite terminals – widely used by scam centres on the Thai-Myanmar border for online activities. The statement blamed what it called the \"terrorist\" Karen National Union and volunteer people's defence forces, which have been fighting the junta since the coup, for illegally occupying the area.The junta's claim to have shut down this infamous scam centre is almost certainly directed at its main patron, China. Beijing has been pressing the junta and the Thai government to do more to end the illegal businesses run by Chinese syndicates on their border. Earlier this year thousands of Chinese workers were taken out of scam compounds and flown on chartered planes back to China, after Thailand cut access to power and fuel supplies.But KK Park is only one of at least 30 similar compounds located on the border. Most of these are under the protection of Karen militia groups allied to the junta, and most are still operating, with tens of thousands of people running scams inside them. In fact, the support of these militia groups has been crucial in helping the military drive back the KNU and other resistance groups from territory they captured over the past two years.The military now controls nearly all of the road linking Myawaddy to the rest of Myanmar, a goal the junta set itself before it holds the first stage of the election in December. It has taken Lay Kay Kaw, a new town established for the KNU with Japanese funding in 2015, a time when there had been hopes for lasting peace in Karen State following a national ceasefire.That is a more significant blow to the KNU than the takeover of KK Park, from which it did get some revenue, but where most of the financial benefits went to pro-junta militias. A well-placed source has told the BBC that scam work is continuing in KK Park, and that it is likely the military took control of only part of the sprawling complex. The source also believes Beijing is giving the Myanmar military lists of Chinese individuals it wants taken from the scam compounds, and sent back to face trial in China, which may explain why KK Park was attacked.",

    "body": "6 hours agoJohn Sudworthin Kyiv, andMaia DaviesUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he would be ready to join Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin at a proposed summit in Hungary if he were invited.The US and Russian presidents announced on Thursday that they planned to hold talks on the war in Ukraine in Budapest, possibly in the coming weeks.In comments released on Monday, Zelensky told reporters: \"If it is an invitation in a format where we meet as three or, as it's called, shuttle diplomacy... then in one format or another, we will agree.\"Meanwhile, media reports suggest his White House meeting with Trump on Friday descended into a \"shouting match\" - with the US side urging Ukraine to accept Russia's terms to end the war.Zelensky was guarded during his first press briefing since the talks, but still his comments made clear that there were large areas of disagreement between the two sides.He described the meeting as frank, and said he had told Trump that his main aim was a just peace, not a quick peace.He criticised Hungary as the location of the prospective Trump-Putin talks, saying the country's Prime Minister Viktor Orban could not do \"anything positive for Ukrainians or even provide a balanced contribution\".When asked by reporters on Friday if Zelensky would be involved in the meeting in Budapest, Trump said he wanted to \"make it comfortable for everybody\".\"We'll be involved in threes, but it may be separated,\" he said, adding the three leaders \"have to get together\".Zelensky had hoped to secure US Tomahawk missiles to strike deep into Russia at the talks, but appeared to walk away empty-handed as Trump struck a non-committal tone on the matter.Media reports on Monday suggested the atmosphere at the US and Ukrainian leaders' meeting had been far more acrimonious than previously understood.The Financial Times reported that Trump had warned Zelensky that Putin would \"destroy\" Ukraine if he did not agree to its terms, citing sources familiar with the conversation.The US side was said to have echoed Russian talking points at the \"volatile\" meeting. It also reported that Trump tossed aside maps of the front line in Ukraine and insisted Zelensky surrender the entire eastern Donbas region to Putin.Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It currently controls around a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including most - but not all - of the Donbas.Just last month, Trump appeared to take a major shift in his position on ending the war by saying Kyiv could \"win all of Ukraine back in its original form\".He said at the time that his position had changed \"after getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia military and economic situation\".Trump had previously warned the process would likely involve Ukraine giving up some territory - an outcome Zelensky has consistently rejected.The US president has been pressuring Nato nations, as well as China and India, to stop purchasing Russian oil in a bid to create further economic pressure on Moscow to end the conflict.He also previously threatened Russia with tougher sanctions if Putin did not meet deadlines to make progress in ending the war, though he did not follow through with those threats.Trump's public relations with Zelensky had also vastly improved in recent months, after an Oval Office meeting in February during which he and Vice-President JD Vance berated the Ukrainian president on live television.During his re-election campaign, Trump claimed he would be able to end the war in Ukraine within days but has since admitted resolving the conflict has been more challenging than any he has been involved in since returning to office.",

    "body": "These confederate statues caused nationwide protests. Melted down, they're now art pieces16 hours agoRegan MorrisLos AngelesBBC / Regan MorrisA statue of Matthew Fontaine Maury, a Confederate officer, on display A massive monument of General Robert E Lee that once sparked riots in the Virginia city of Charlottesville is now a pile of melted-down bronze, artfully displayed in a Los Angeles museum.Next to the sculpture are barrels of toxic \"slag\" leftover from the melting process.Around the corner, there is a massive, graffitied equestrian statue of Lee and Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson – the two most famous Confederate generals in the US Civil War, which the Confederacy lost in 1865 and ultimately led to the end of slavery in the United States.\"They fought for slavery,\" says curator Hamza Walker, who has been working for eight years to acquire and borrow the massive monuments amid lawsuits and the logistical challenges of moving tens of thousands of pounds of bronze and granite to Los Angeles.\"The idea of lionising those figures. What did they believe? They believed in white supremacy. Period.\"Coming at a time when President Donald Trump is ordering statues and paintings of Confederate generals to be reinstalled, the warring narratives of American history are at the heart of \"Monuments,\" which opens 23 October at The Brick and at the Geffen Contemporary at the Museum of Contemporary Art.The 18 decommissioned Confederate monuments are displayed alongside pieces of contemporary art. The massive, graffitied statue of Lee and Jackson, for example, stands next to a giant replica sculpture of the \"General Lee\" car from the iconic TV show, The Dukes of Hazzard.BBC / Regan MorrisJalane Schmidt, an activist who campaigned for the statue of Lee to be removed from Charlottesville, stands in front of the sculpture the statue has becomePresident Trump has often spoken of General Lee's bravery and he and others have criticised the removal and toppling of Confederate monuments, saying it's revisionist history. White nationalists marched in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017, triggering deadly clashes, to keep the statue from being removed. In the aftermath, similar statues sparked clashes in cities across the US. \"Under this historical revision, our Nation's unparalleled legacy of advancing liberty, individual rights, and human happiness is reconstructed as inherently racist, sexist, oppressive, or otherwise irredeemably flawed,\" President Trump wrote in a March executive order calling for paintings and monuments to be reinstalled.But Mr Walker says putting Lee and Jackson on pedestals – even though they lost the war – is racist and promotes the Lost Cause ideology that argues the Civil War was a noble cause for states' rights and not about slavery.\"States rights to do what? The reason for the Civil War was slavery,\" he said, adding that it perpetuates the idea that the South was a \"noble victim\", and that slavery wasn't so terrible.\"If you could distance them from slavery, right, then you could portray them as heroes, even though they lost the war and were on the wrong side of history, fighting for something that was morally repugnant,\" he says.BBC Keith “Chuck” Tayman\"Unmanned Drone\" by artist Kara Walker is the centrepiece of the exhibit The centrepiece of the show is \"Unmanned Drone\" – a completely reconstructed sculpture of Stonewall Jackson by artist Kara Walker, who transformed the horse and its rider heading into battle into a headless, zombie-like creature.\"The southern vernacular would be a 'haint', which would be a ghostly form,\" Kara Walker, who is not related to Hamza Walker, told the BBC when asked how she describes the work. \"It's an attempt to rethink the legacies of Stonewall Jackson as a mythology, as mythological holder for white supremacy.\"Most of the monuments on display will be returned to the cities and towns they've been borrowed from when the show closes in May. But Kara Walker's sculpture will need to find a new home. And the bronze ingots from the melted down Lee sculpture will be transformed again into a new work of art.The statue was removed in 2021 and melted in 2023 after the Charlottesville City Council voted to donate the statue to the Jefferson School - African American Heritage Center.\"It's a toxic representation of history, this lost cause narrative, and we're purifying it,\" says Jalane Schmidt, an activist and professor who was there when the statue came down in Charlottesville, and when it was melted at a secret foundry. She came to see it in its new form in Los Angeles.Getty ImagesWhite nationalists marched on Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017Living in Charlottesville, she said, the statue was always in the background until a teenage girl in 2016 started a petition to rename Lee Park and remove the statue because she found it offensive that the city would celebrate someone who fought for slavery.The statue was the focal point for the Unite the Right rally in 2017, which turned deadly when a 21-year-old white nationalist ploughed his car into counter protesters killing Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old paralegal and civil rights activist.Schmidt says the petition and the rally changed public opinion about the monuments in Charlottesville and elsewhere. \"Especially after Unite the Right, after we were attacked, well, clearly this was evidence that, you know, people are willing to die for symbols, but they're also willing to kill for them,\" she said. \"We had to remove them just for our own health.\"",

    "body": "A bus driver has died after being hit when a coach carrying supporters of an Italian basketball team was attacked with stones, allegedly by rival fans.Pistoia Basket fans were travelling on the highway near the town of Rieti, 80km (50 miles) north-east of Rome, when fans of SRS Sebastiani Rieti began throwing objects, according to local media.Fans of the Tuscany-based Pistoia had been returning from a game between the two second-tier sides, which their team had won.A large stone smashed through the windscreen and struck one of the two drivers on the head. Raffaele Marianella, 65, was sitting at the front but not driving at the time of the attack. He later died of his injuries.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the attack was \"an unacceptable and insane act of violence\". She expressed her condolences to the victim's family and said those responsible would be brought to justice.A police investigation is under way to track down the perpetrators.Italy's Sports Minister Andrea Abodi described the attack as a \"shocking assault\" carried out by \"criminals who have turned into murderers and can never be called fans\". \"This is not about basketball. These are criminals,\" said Gianni Petrucci, president of Federbasket, Italy's national basketball federation. He said he would work with the legal authorities on a response to the attack.\"They are murderers, people with no present and no future,\" he told national broadcaster RAI.",

    "body": "3 hours agoYolande KnellMiddle East correspondent, JerusalemReutersSunday saw the deadliest day of attacks since the ceasefire took effect on 10 OctoberOne week ago, US President Donald Trump was given a hero's welcome in Israel after securing the Gaza ceasefire and exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners.But the days since have shown just how precarious the ceasefire is, and Sunday brought its biggest test so far.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched a series of deadly strikes across Gaza, after two soldiers were killed in the southern city of Rafah in an attack it blamed on Hamas. Hamas said it was not responsible because it had not had contact with fighters in the area since communications were cut off in March.An Israeli security official announced the suspension of aid deliveries as a result of the attack.It appears US pressure ensured the truce was not derailed and that Israel's crossings with Gaza reopened on Monday.  Now it is clear mediators must stay closely involved to shore up the deal and settle key issues on the future of Gaza and Hamas.Already, the president's special envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are back in the region while Hamas negotiators are meeting Egyptian mediators and Palestinian factions in Cairo.All are expected to discuss the second phase of Trump's 20-point peace plan, which involves deploying an international stabilisation force in Gaza, the eventual withdrawal of the IDF and critically, the disarmament of Hamas.Shadi Abu Obeid said his teenage son was killed in an Israeli strike in the southern al-Mawasi areaPalestinians and Israelis have been shaken by the latest breakdown.\"From the start of the war I was with him 24 hours a day, I never left him,\" bereaved father, Shadi Abu Obeid told the BBC in Khan Younis as he fought back tears at the funeral of his 14-year-old son Mohammed early on Monday.\"Because of the ceasefire I was a bit more relaxed, and I let him go out with his friends,\" Shadi added. \"It was quiet and there were meant to be international guarantees.\"Mohammed was killed with two others in an Israeli strike on a tent in al-Mawasi.  The IDF would not comment on who or what was specifically being targeted.At least 45 Palestinians were killed, local hospitals say, after the IDF said it struck \"dozens of Hamas terror targets throughout the Gaza Strip\".The BBC understands that several members of Hamas's armed wing, including a commander, were killed in a strike on a makeshift café in central Gaza. However, footage from other locations showed civilians, including children, among the dead.ReutersIsrael said it struck targets across Gaza after a \"blatant violation\" of the truce by HamasTrump's envoys – who played a key role in negotiations with Hamas – had been expected in Israel to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, prior to the latest events.Before they left the US, the two men gave an interview to 60 Minutes on CBS, in which they described how they had broken with diplomatic protocols to hold direct talks with Hamas leaders during ceasefire talks in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt.They said this was intended to give guarantees that fighting would not resume after Israeli hostages were returned. Kushner - Trump's son-in-law – said the president had been \"very, very comfortable\" with such an approach.He also said the signs were that Hamas was acting \"in good faith\" to return the bodies of deceased hostages – a main point of contention with Israel, prior to Sunday's events, threatening the ceasefire.  Sixteen bodies have yet to be handed back.  Hamas has said it has recovered another corpse which will be handed back when \"conditions allow.\"ReutersHamas accused Israel of fabricating \"pretexts\" to resume the warSpeaking to journalists on Air Force One on Sunday, President Trump stressed the truce remained in place and that \"we want to make sure it's going to be very peaceful\".When it came to the threat of internal violence and score-settling by Hamas in Gaza, he said that Hamas had been \"quite rambunctious\" and \"they've been doing some shooting\".  But he added that \"maybe the leadership isn't involved\", and that it could be \"some rebels within\".The IDF denied reports that its actions on Sunday were triggered by a clash between Hamas and a militia allied to Israel in the city of Rafah, in southern Gaza. It said Hamas had launched several direct attacks on its troops in an area still under its control with an anti-tank missile and gunfire.An Israeli government spokeswoman said forces had been working near Rafah \"to dismantle terrorist infrastructure all in accordance with the ceasefire agreement.\"Hamas, which has accused Israel of multiple ceasefire violations, said communication with its remaining cells in Rafah had been cut off for months and that it was \"not responsible for any incidents occurring in those areas\".The latest events have Israeli commentators focusing once again on the weaknesses of the deal agreed by Israel and Hamas.In Israel's Haaretz newspaper, journalist and author Amir Tibon notes that it was \"full of vague wording that left significant loopholes.\"One problem that he says it left unresolved \"was the fate of Hamas fighters stranded in the areas of Gaza held by Israel when the ceasefire went into effect\". Israel's military currently holds about half of the territory, demarcated by a so-called Yellow Line.In Israel Hayom, military columnist Yoav Limor describes the firefight near Rafah as \"a warning\", adding: \"If Israel fails to establish tough and clear rules vis-à-vis Hamas it could find itself on a slippery slope.\"Israeli Defence Ministry via ReutersThe Israeli defence ministry posted a video showing the installation of blocks marking the \"Yellow Line\"Israel's Defence Minister, Israel Katz, has since appeared to do that, putting out a message that any Hamas fighters beyond the Yellow Line, in Israeli-controlled parts of Gaza must leave immediately and that Hamas leaders will be held responsible for their actions.With Palestinians expressing confusion about the exact location of the line, the IDF has put out a video showing bulldozers towing yellow blocks into place to mark it out.On Monday, Palestinian health officials said Israeli fire killed three people east of Gaza City. The IDF said its troops fired towards \"several terrorists\" who crossed the Yellow Line in the Shejaiya area.ReutersIsraelis have been celebrating the release of the 20 living hostages after two years in captivity in GazaTough rhetoric and domestic pressure on Netanyahu are now anticipated as Israel's parliament begins its winter session, and with an internal election due within the prime minister's Likud party.Netanyahu directed the military to take \"strong action\" against breaches of the deal, but he refrained from threatening a return to war.On the Palestinian side, Hamas spokesman Mohammed Nazzal has called for the speedy approval of a committee of politically independent Palestinian technocrats to govern Gaza, telling Al Jazeera that Hamas had submitted a list of more than 40 proposed names to mediators.However, in a separate interview with Reuters, he indicated that Hamas intended to maintain security control in Gaza for an interim period, illustrating another major obstacle to cementing the full end of the war in Gaza.In the US, Vice President JD Vance has downplayed the shakiness of the ceasefire, saying: \"There's going to be fits and starts.\" It was, he said, \"the best chance for a sustainable peace\".Meanwhile, Witkoff and Kushner are expected to go on to further meetings in Cairo.  There are significant obstacles to overcome before there can be more celebrations over the Gaza ceasefire.",

    "body": "'We have failed' says minister as France reels from Louvre heist4 hours agoGabriela PomeroyThe BBC's Hugh Schofield at the scene of ''brazen'' Louvre jewel theftSecurity protocols \"failed\" in preventing a major jewellery heist at the Louvre museum in Paris, leaving the country with a \"terrible image\", France's justice minister has said.Thieves wielding power tools broke into the world's most-visited museum in broad daylight on Sunday, stealing eight items described as of inestimable value, before escaping on scooters.Security measures have been tightened around France's cultural institutions, advisers for the country's interior minister said.There are fears that, unless the thieves are caught quickly, the priceless items, including a diamond and emerald necklace Emperor Napoleon gave to his wife, will be broken down and smuggled out of the country.The Louvre announced it would remain closed on Monday while investigations continued.French media reports that a preliminary assessment by the Court of Auditors (due to be published in November) found that a third of the rooms in the wing where the robbery took place have no surveillance cameras. \"What is certain is that we have failed, since people were able to park a furniture hoist in the middle of Paris, get people up it in several minutes to grab priceless jewels,\" Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin told France Inter radio.ReutersThe Louvre said it would remain closed on Monday due to \"exceptional reasons\"He added that he was certain police would eventually arrest the thieves.But the head of an organisation specialising in the location and recovery of stolen artworks warned that if the thieves were not caught in the next 24-48 hours, the stolen jewellery will likely be \"long gone\".\"There is a race going on right now,\" Chris Marinello, the chief executive of Art Recovery International, told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme. Crowns and diadems - which were stolen in the heist - can easily be broken apart and sold in small parts. The thieves \"are not going to keep them intact - they are going to break them up, melt down the valuable metal, recut the valuable stones and hide evidence of their crime\", Mr Marinello said, adding that it would be difficult to sell these jewels intact.The French police \"know that in the next 24 or 48 hours, if these thieves are not caught, those pieces are probably long gone\", he said.\"They may catch the criminals but they won't recover the jewels.\"Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen A tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenNuñez said he was aware of \"a great vulnerability\" in museum security in France. The decision to tighten security at the country's cultural institutions was made on Monday after a meeting with police and ministers, including Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez.French President Emmanuel Macron described the robbery as an \"attack on a heritage that we cherish because it is our history\". And Nathalie Goulet, a member of the French Senate's finance committee, said it was a \"very painful\" episode for France.\"We are all disappointed and angry,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding that it was \"difficult to understand how it happened so easily\".Goulet said that the gallery's alarm had recently been broken, and \"we have to wait for the investigation in order to know if the alarm was disactivated\".The cut-up jewels would be \"used in a money laundering system\", she suggested.\"I don't think we are facing amateurs. This is organised crime and they have absolutely no morals. They don't appreciate jewellery as a piece of history, only as a way to clean their dirty money.\"EPA/ShutterstockThe thieves approached the building from the River Seine banksideThe theft took place between 09:30 and 09:40 local time on Sunday morning, shortly after the museum opened to visitors.Four masked thieves used a truck equipped with a mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine.Pictures from the scene showed a vehicle-mounted ladder leading up to a first-floor window.Two of the thieves cut through glass panes with a battery-powered disc cutter and entered the museum.They then threatened the guards, who evacuated the building.The thieves smashed the glass display cases and stole the jewels, which collectively contained thousands of diamonds and precious gemstones.The robbery took just seven minutes.As the museum's alarms started blaring, staff followed protocol by contacting security forces, the culture ministry said in a statement.The thieves had tried to set fire to their vehicle outside but were prevented by the intervention of a museum staff-member, it added.Eight items of jewellery were stolen in total, including an emerald and diamond necklace that Napoleon gifted his wife, Empress Marie Louise.Also taken was a diadem (jewelled headband) that once belonged to the Empress Eugénie - Napoleon III's wife - which has nearly 2,000 diamonds.They also took a necklace that once belonged to Marie-Amelie, the last queen of France, which contains eight sapphires and 631 diamonds.",

    "body": "China will soon have a new Five Year Plan. Here's how they have changed the world so far17 hours agoNick MarshAFP via Getty ImagesChina's top leaders are gathering in Beijing this week to decide on the country's key goals and aspirations for the rest of the decade.Every year or so, the country's highest political body, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, convenes for a week of meetings, also known as a Plenum.What it decides at this one will eventually form the basis of China's next Five Year Plan - the blueprint that the world's second largest economy will follow between 2026 and 2030.The full plan won't come until next year, but officials are likely to hint at its contents on Wednesday and have previously given more details within a week of that.\"Western policy works on election cycles, but Chinese policy making operates on planning cycles,\" says Neil Thomas, a fellow in Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute.\"Five Year Plans spell out what China wants to achieve, signal the direction the leadership wants to go in and move the resources of the state towards these predefined conclusions,\" he adds.On the surface, the idea of hundreds of suited bureaucrats shaking hands and drawing up plans may appear drab - but history tells us that what they decide often has huge repercussions for the world.Here are three times China's Five Year Plan reshaped the global economy.1981-84: 'Reform and Opening Up'Pinpointing exactly when China began its journey to become an economic powerhouse is difficult, but many in the Party like to say it was on 18 December 1978.For nearly three decades, China's economy had been rigidly controlled by the state. But Soviet-style central planning had failed to lift prosperity and many were still struggling in poverty. The country was still recovering from Mao Zedong's devastating rule. The Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution - campaigns led by Communist China's founder to reshape the nation's economy and society - resulted in millions of deaths.Speaking at the 11th Committee's Third Plenum in Beijing, the country's new leader Deng Xiaoping declared that it was time to embrace some elements of the free market.His policy of \"reform and opening up\" became integral to the next Five Year Plan, which began in 1981.The creation of free trading Special Economic Zones - and the foreign investment they attracted - transformed the lives of people in China.Getty ImagesDeng Xiaoping's opening up of China's economy included a landmark agreement with US President Jimmy Carter in 1979According to Mr Thomas, the aims of that Five Year Plan could not have been achieved more emphatically.\"China today is beyond the wildest dreams of people in the 1970s,\" he says. \"In terms of restoring national pride as well as establishing its place amongst the great powers of the world,\" he says.But it also fundamentally reshaped the global economy. By the 21st Century, millions of Western manufacturing jobs had been outsourced to new factories in China's coastal regions.Economists have called this \"the China shock\" and it's been one of the driving forces behind the rise of populist parties in former industrial parts of Europe and the United States.For example, Donald Trump's economic policies - his tariffs and trade wars - are designed to bring back the American manufacturing jobs lost to China over the previous few decades.2011-15: 'Strategic emerging industries'China's status as the workshop of the world was cemented once it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. But at the turn of the century, the Communist Party leadership was already planning its next move.It was wary of China falling into the so-called \"middle income trap\". This happens when an upwardly mobile country can't offer ultra-low wages anymore, but at the same time doesn't have the innovative capacity to create the high-end goods and services of an advanced economy.So instead of just cheap manufacturing, China needed to find what it called \"strategic emerging industries\" - a term first officially used in 2010. For China's leaders, this meant green technology, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and solar panels.As climate change became increasingly important in Western politics, China mobilised an unprecedented amount of resources into these new industries.Today, China is not only the undisputed world leader in renewables and EVs, it also has a near monopoly over the rare earth supply chains needed to build them.China's stranglehold on these key resources - which are also crucial to chip-making and artificial intelligence (AI) - now puts it in a powerful position globally.So much so that Beijing's recent move to tighten export controls on rare earths was labelled by Trump as an attempt to \"hold the world captive\".Although \"strategic emerging forces\" was enshrined in the next Five Year Plan in 2011, green technology had been identified as a potential engine of growth and geopolitical power by China's then leader Hu Jintao in the early 2000s.\"This desire for China to be more self-reliant in its economy, in its technology, in its freedom of action, goes back a long way - it is part of the fibre of Chinese Communist Party ideology,\" explains Neil Thomas.2021-2025: 'High quality development'This may explain why China's Five Year Plans more recently have turned their attention to \"high quality development\", formally introduced by Xi Jinping in 2017.This means challenging American dominance in technology and putting China at the forefront of the sector.Domestic success stories such as the video sharing app TikTok, telecommunications giant Huawei and even DeepSeek, the AI model, are all testament to China's technological boom this century.But Western countries increasingly see this as a threat to their national security. The subsequent bans or attempted bans on popular Chinese technology have affected millions of internet users around the world and have sparked bitter diplomatic rows.Grigory Sysoev/RIA Novosti/Pool/Anadolu via Getty ImagesUnder Xi, China's Five Year Plans have focused on \"high quality development\"Until now, China has powered its tech success using American innovation, such as Nvidia's advanced semiconductors.Given their sale to China has now been blocked by Washington, expect \"high quality development\" to morph into \"new quality productive forces\" - a fresh slogan introduced by Xi in 2023, which tilts the focus more towards domestic pride and national security.This means putting China at the cutting edge of chip-making, computing and AI - not reliant on Western technology and immune to embargoes.Self-sufficiency in all areas, especially at the very top end of innovation, is likely to be one of the central tenets of the next Five Year Plan.\"National security and technological independence are now the defining mission of China's economic policy,\" Mr Thomas explains. \"Again, it goes back to that nationalist project that underpins communism in China, to ensure it never again is dominated by foreign countries\".",

    "body": "9 hours agoKoh Ewein Singapore, andJake Kwonin SeoulA South Korean court has sentenced a teacher to life in prison for fatally stabbing an eight-year-old girl, in a case that shocked the nation.Myeong Jae-wan, 48, killed Kim Hae-neul after luring her into a classroom in the central city of Daejeon in February.Prosecutors had sought the death penalty for Myeong, saying that the victim's family had asked for a harsh punishment.But the court said that while \"the risk of reoffending is high, it is difficult to conclude\" that Myeong must be executed. Myeong said that she would reflect on her mistakes for the rest of her life.She said her judgement had weakened at the time of the stabbing as she was receiving mental health treatment.Prosecutors said Myeong showed no remorse while the case was being investigated. However, Myeong submitted dozens of letters to the court expressing remorse.Myeong had previously requested a six-month leave of absence, citing depression, but returned to school 20 days later, after a doctor assessed her as being fit to work, the Daejeon education office said in February.She had displayed violent behaviour in the days before the stabbing, including putting another teacher in a headlock, the education office said.On the morning of the stabbing, two education officials had visited the school to investigate that earlier altercation.Myeong told police that she had bought a weapon on the day of the attack and brought it into school, planning to kill herself along with a random child.She also told the police that she had lured Kim into the media room before attacking her.Kim, the student, student was reported missing after a bus driver informed the school that she had not arrived to be picked up that day. She was found in school later that day with stab wounds, along with Myeong.Myeong also had a wound on her neck, which police said might have been self-inflicted. It was stitched up later in hospital.South Korea's leaders at the time called for safety measures to ensure such incidents never happen again.Myeong has also been ordered to wear an electronic location tracking device for 30 years.\"As an elementary school teacher, the accused was in a position to protect the victim,\" said the court's verdict on Monday. \"But she committed this brutal crime in which a child was not protected where they should be most safe.\"",

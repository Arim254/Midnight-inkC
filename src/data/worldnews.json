    "body": "Flights returning to normal after Airbus warning grounded planes8 hours agoHafsa KhalilGetty ImagesThousands of Airbus planes are returning to normal service after being briefly grounded following a warning that solar radiation could interfere with onboard computers.The aerospace giant - based in France - said about 6,000 of its A320 planes had been affected, with most requiring a quick software update. Some 900 older planes need a replacement computer.On Saturday, French Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot said the updates \"went very smoothly\" for more than 5,000 planes, and fewer than 100 still needed the update.Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury apologised for what he called \"logistical challenges and delays\".He said teams were working to ensure that updates are completed \"as swiftly as possible\".On Saturday morning, several Air France flights in and out of Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport were delayed or cancelled.American Airlines said it expected \"operational delays\" but added that the vast majority of updates would be carried out by Saturday. Delta Airlines said it believed the impact on its operations would be limited.The UK Civil Aviation Authority said that airlines operating in the country worked through the night to carry out the update and air traffic had not been seriously affected.London's Gatwick Airport reported \"some disruption\", while Heathrow said it had not experienced any cancellations.Manchester Airport said it did not anticipate significant problems, and Luton Airport reported that there was \"no expected impact\".British Airways and Air India are understood not to be heavily impacted by the issue.On Saturday, Easyjet said it had completed the update on a \"significant number\" of its aircraft, and planned to operate as normal.Wizz Air is also running as normal, having rolled out updates overnight.In Australia, budget airline Jetstar cancelled 90 flights. Most of its aircraft have now undergone the update, but some disruptions are expected though the weekend.Air New Zealand grounded its A320 planes, but all fights have now resumed after the update was completed.Airbus discovered the issue after a JetBlue Airways plane flying between the US and Mexico suddenly lost altitude and emergency landed in October. At least 15 people were injured.The firm identified a problem with the aircraft's computing software which calculates a plane's elevation, and found that at high altitudes, data could be corrupted by intense radiation released periodically by the Sun. As well as the A320, the company's best-selling aircraft, the A318, A319 and the A321 models were also affected.Older planes that require new computers remain grounded. How long the replacement takes will depend on the availability of computers.",

    "body": "Pope Leo XIV has visited Istanbul's Sultan Ahmed Mosque - widely known as the Blue Mosque - in his first visit to a Muslim place of worship since he took up the papacy in May.The Pontiff was seen bowing as he entered the building, but it is reported he did not pray at the mosque, as his two predecessors had done.The Vatican said in a statement Leo undertook the tour \"in a spirit of reflection and listening, with deep respect for the place and for the faith of those who gather there in prayer\".The Pope is on a four-day trip to Turkey, after which he will visit Lebanon.He was later welcomed to St George's Cathedral in Istanbul by the head of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Patriarch Bartholomew.The Blue Mosque is officially named for Sultan Ahmed I, leader of the Ottoman Empire from 1603 to 1617, who oversaw its construction. It is decorated with thousands of blue and turquoise ceramic tiles and receives millions of visitors each year.Pope Francis prayed there in 2014, and Pope Benedict XVI did so in 2006.The first pope to officially enter a mosque was John Paul II, who made history when he visited the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus in 2001. The papal visit to Turkey and Lebanon had been planned by late Pope Francis, but its theme of building bridges was embraced by Pope Leo from the moment he stepped on the balcony of St Peter's Basilica after his election in May.At the start of his trip, he warned that the world should not give into \"a heightened level of conflict on the global level\", adding that \"the future of humanity is at stake\".In Lebanon - where an estimated third of the country is Christian - he is expected to meet more faith leaders and hear from young people. On the final day of the trip, he will celebrate Mass at the Beirut waterfront at the site of the 2020 port explosion, praying for the more than 200 people who were killed and 7,000 others injured.",

The Labor leader's proposal and the wedding reception both took place at his official residence, The Lodge.ReutersAlbanese (right) alongside his son Nathan and his dog Toto - the ring bearerUntil the big day, the wedding plans had been kept under wraps due to concerns about security and potential disruptions.In attendance were Jodie Haydon's parents as well as Albanese's son, Nathan, from his previous marriage.Albanese's dog Toto acted as ring bearer while the couple walked back down the aisle to Stevie Wonder's \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours)\".The prime minister also shared a video on his official social media accounts showing the happy couple walking down the aisle as guests showered them in confetti. Several of Albanese's cabinet ministers attended the ceremony. ReutersAt the reception, their first dance was to The Way You Look Tonight by Frank Sinatra.The celebrations also featured custom-made beer cans printed with the image used to announce their engagement.The couple are set to honeymoon in Australia from Monday to Friday next week - plans that were pared back after his re-election in May.Albanese, 62, and Jodie Haydon, 47, first met at a business dinner in Melbourne in 2020, while he was leader of the opposition.ReutersShe appeared during Albanese's 2022 and 2025 election campaigns, and was seen alongside the PM at major events, including the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II and a state dinner hosted by former US President Joe Biden.Albanese also made Australian history by becoming the first prime minister to get engaged while in office.The couple said in a joint statement at the time that they were \"so lucky to have found each other\".",

    "body": "Donald Trump has said that he will pardon the former president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted of drug trafficking charges in a US court last year. The US president said Hernández had been \"treated very harshly and unfairly\" in a social media post announcing the move on Friday.Hernández was found guilty in March 2024 of conspiring to import cocaine into the US, and of possessing machine guns. He was sentenced to 45 years in prison.Trump also threw his support behind conservative presidential candidate Nasry \"Tito\" Asfura in the Central American nation's general election, due to be held on Sunday.Hernández, a member of the National Party, who served as Honduras's president from 2014 to 2022, was extradited to the US in April 2022 to stand trial for running a violent drug trafficking conspiracy and helping to smuggle hundreds of tons of cocaine to the US. During his trial, prosecutors in New York said Hernández ran the Central American country like a \"narco-state\" and accepted millions of dollars in bribes from drug traffickers to shield them from the law.He was also ordered to pay a fine of $8m (£6m) as part of his sentence. Polls indicate this year's Honduran election remains a toss-up between three candidates including Asfura, the former mayor of Tegucigalpa and leader of the conservative National Party.Also in the running is Rixi Moncada, a former defence minister standing for the ruling left-wing Libre Party, and Salvador Nasralla, a television host with the centrist Liberal Party.Trump criticised Moncada and Nasralla on Friday, writing that the latter was \"a boderline Communist\" who was only running to split the vote between Moncada and Asfura.He characterised Asfura as \"standing up for democracy\" and praised him for campaigning against Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro, with whom Trump has engaged in a war of words in recent months.Nasralla has pledged to cut ties with Venezuela if he wins.The Trump administration has accused the left-wing Maduro - whose re-election last year was dismissed as illegitimate by many countries - of being the leader of a drugs cartel.It used countering drug trafficking as a justification for a military build-up in the Caribbean and has conducted strikes on vessels it says have been used for smuggling - though some analysts have described these moves as a means of pressuring Latin American leaders.Honduras has been governed since 2022 by President Xiomara Castro, who has forged close ties with Cuba and Venezuela.But Castro has maintained a co-operative relationship with the US, agreeing to preserve a long-running extradition treaty with it. Her country also hosts a US military base involved in targeting transnational organised crime in the region. More than 80 people have been killed in the US strikes on vessels suspected of being involved in the transport of narcotics since they began in August.US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth has said the aim of \"Operation Southern Spear\" was to eliminate \"narcoterrorists\". But legal experts have questioned the legality of the strikes, pointing out that the US has provided no evidence that the boats it has targeted were carrying drugs.",

    "body": "1 day agoRaffi BergReutersIsrael's military has released footage showing an air strike hitting a buildingAt least 13 people have been killed in an Israeli raid on a village in southern Syria overnight, state media reported, in one of the deadliest incidents of its kind for months. It said children were among the dead.Sana news agency said residents of Beit Jinn \"confronted\" Israeli troops, leading to a firefight. Air strikes were also carried out. Syria's foreign ministry condemned what it called a \"war crime\" by Israel.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops went into the village, on the edge of the occupied Golan Heights, to detain militants who it said \"advanced terror attacks against Israeli civilians\".Six Israeli soldiers were injured in the clashes, three seriously, it said. The IDF said it targeted the Jamaa Islamiya militant group in Friday's operation. It said that when the raid began, \"several armed terrorists opened fire\" on its soldiers, who fired back. Sana said the village was also shelled. Footage released by the IDF shows two air strikes - one apparently on a group of people, and the other on a building. In bodycam footage also released by the IDF, soldiers can be seen firing on a street in the dark with the sound of automatic gunfire in the distance. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, said a building collapsed during the operation.The IDF later said \"all of the suspects were apprehended, and a number of terrorists were eliminated\".Sana said three people were arrested by the troops before they withdrew.ReutersIsrael said it targeted militants, although Syria said women and children were among the deadSana quoted the director of a local hospital as saying it had received bodies, including five from one family. The director said dozens of people had also been injured in the incident.The Syrian foreign ministry said more than 10 civilians had been killed, including women and children. It accused Israel of committing a \"fully-fledged war crime\", and called on the UN Security Council to do something to stop Israel's \"policy of aggression\". Israel regularly carries out incursions into Syrian villages, saying it acts to prevent the presence of armed groups.Since the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad nearly a year ago, Israel has moved its forces across a buffer zone on the Golan Heights into southern Syria, where a number of anti-Israel groups and cells operate.Israel says it will not allow the Syrian army, which it considers a threat, to deploy there.The buffer zone - a demilitarised stretch of land - had been a no-go area designed to keep the peace after a ceasefire ended the 1973 war between Israel and Syria. The UN has said the IDF's deployment there was a \"violation\" of the agreement which it said both sides should uphold.The US has for months been mediating talks between Israel and Syria for a security agreement in the area between the two sides, but without success.",

    "body": "8 hours agoAleks PhillipsandYang TianMore than 600,000 people in the Kyiv region of Ukraine were without power on Saturday morning after an overnight Russian attack.Ukraine's energy ministry said more than 500,000 of these were in the capital itself, with the rest in the surrounding region. It attributed the power losses to missile and drone strikes on energy infrastructure in the city and several other regions.Around 36 missiles and nearly 600 drones were launched on targets across Ukraine overnight, officials said, killing three and injuring dozens of others.Russia has intensified attacks on Ukrainian civilian and energy infrastructure as the embattled nation heads into winter, despite US-led efforts to secure a peace deal.Russia's defence ministry said it had launched \"a massive strike... against Ukrainian military-industrial complex enterprises and the energy facilities that support their operation\".Dtek Energy, which serves properties in Kyiv, said later on Saturday that power had been restored to more than 360,000 families.As well as energy infrastructure, several residential buildings were hit in the overnight strikes, Ukrainian officials said.Loud explosions were heard across Kyiv early on Saturday morning. Emergency services were later seen attending to burning blocks of flats damaged by strikes.Kyiv's Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said a 13-year-old child was among the 29 people injured in the capital city.Ukraine's Air Force said it shot down 558 of the drones and 19 of the missiles.Kyiv is among several cities that have suffered regular aerial bombardment since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Many Ukrainians have also had to live through regular blackouts, as Moscow has targeted energy infrastructure in previous winters.On Sunday it is forecast to fall to 2C in Kyiv, which has average temperatures below freezing in December.Ukraine has targeted Russian energy infrastructure, including oil refineries and depots, in particular with long-range weaponry that can probe deep inside Russia. It says this is to curb revenue for Moscow's war effort from Russia's main export.Meanwhile Ukrainian media is reporting that Ukrainian maritime drones struck two oil tankers in the Black Sea on Friday, which are thought to be part of Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\" of vessels used to evade Western sanctions.Video footage published online and verified by the BBC shows a waterborne drone barrelling towards one of the boats, before another video shows fire and smoke billowing out of the vessel's side.The stricken tankers are named Kairos and Virat, according to Turkish authorities. Both are flagged to Gambia. Footage released by Turkey's Transport Ministry shows two of its own boats trying to extinguish the fire on the Kairos.The latest bombardment came as Ukrainian negotiators were preparing for talks with US officials this weekend. US President Donald Trump is pushing for the two sides to accept a draft peace plan, which was initially slanted heavily in favour of Russia but subsequently revised during talks with Ukrainians and their European allies in Geneva.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has welcomed the diplomatic efforts while stressing Kyiv's need to retain its sovereignty and ability to fend off any future attack.On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin repeated his core demands for ending the war, saying Russia would only halt its offensive if Ukraine's troops withdrew from territory claimed by Moscow.Russian forces currently control most - but not all - of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, as well as a portion of the southern Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. US and European allies have called for the war to be frozen along the current front line.Putin also confirmed a US delegation including special envoy Steve Witkoff was expected in Moscow in the first half of next week to discuss the draft peace plan.",

    "body": "Three days of mourning begin after Hong Kong's deadliest fire in decades8 hours agoTabby WilsonHong Kong officials mark beginning of official mourning period with moment of silenceHong Kong officials have held a moment of silence at the start of a three-day mourning period to remember those killed after the city's deadliest fire in nearly 80 years.At least 128 people are now known to have died in the fire, which engulfed seven tower blocks on Wednesday. A further 83 were injured and 150 remain unaccounted for.Eight people have been arrested on suspicion of corruption over the renovation works the blocks had been undergoing. Three others were detained earlier on manslaughter charges.The cause of the fire has yet to be determined, but officials have said it spread up and between the blocks rapidly because of flammable materials placed on their exterior.Saturday morning's ceremony was held outside government headquarters, and saw city leader John Lee joined by other Hong Kong officials to observe three minutes of silence.The flags of China and Hong Kong were flown at half mast. The government has also set up memorial points across the city, where the public can pay their respects and sign condolence books.Once the fire started, it spread quickly to seven of the eight towers in Wang Fuk Court, in Hong Kong's northerly suburban Tai Po distric.It then took more than 2,000 firefighters almost two days to bring the blaze under control.The cause of the fire remains unclear, though authorities have said that polystyrene placed on the outside of the windows and plastic netting around the scaffolding on the buildings facilitated its spread.The tower blocks were also covered in bamboo scaffolding, which is commonly used for construction and renovation work in Hong Kong. The fire has sparked a debate on whether it should still be used.ReutersOfficials have confirmed that an investigation will be taking place over the next few weeks, with police already gathering evidence from the scene.The fire has caused anger throughout Hong Kong - which is known for its high-rise buildings - as questions about who should be held accountable grow.Residents of Wang Fuk Court have reported broken fire alarms and negligence from the company carrying out the renovations on the Wang Fuk Court, while Hong Kong's fire service has said fire alarms in all eight blocks were not working effectively.The Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) said those arrested in the corruption probe on Friday included directors at an engineering company and scaffolding subcontractors.Hong Kong's Labour and Welfare Secretary, Chris Sun, told reporters that his department had made 16 checks on the works at Wang Fuk Court since July last year.The housing estate was built in 1983 and had provided 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census.",

    "body": "Senegal's prime minister and Nigeria's former president have both said they believe the ousting of Guinea-Bissau's president this week was staged.Umaro Sissoco Embaló's apparent removal by the military on Wednesday came a day before authorities were due to announce election results. The military has since suspended the electoral process and blocked the release of the results, insisting it thwarted a plot to destabilise the politically unstable country.Senegal's PM Ousmane Sonko and Nigeria's ex-leader Goodluck Jonathan did not provide evidence to support their claim that the coup was fabricated. Embaló has previously faced accusations of using crises to quash dissent.Some local civil society groups have accused Embaló of masterminding a \"simulated coup\" against himself with the help of the military, saying it was a ruse to block election results from coming out in case he lost.Embaló has not responded to the allegations.The 53-year-old former president arrived in neighbouring Senegal on a chartered military flight late on Thursday following his release by the military forces who toppled his government.Nigeria's Jonathan, who led a team of election observers from the West African Elders Forum to Guinea-Bissau, said the incident \"was not a coup\".He described it as a \"ceremonial coup\", questioning the events that preceded it and why it was Embaló who first announced his own overthrow. The latter phoned French TV station France 24 and said: \"I have been deposed.\"Jonathan contrasted this with how other leaders in the region were ousted in recent coups.Meanwhile, Senegal's Sonko told lawmakers that \"what happened in Guinea-Bissau was a sham\".Both men have demanded the results of the presidential election be released.Their statements add to opposition claims in Guinea-Bissau that the coup was contrived, though no-one has so far presented evidence to support this.Embaló has said he has survived multiple coup attempts during his time in office - though critics have previously accused him of fabricating crises in order to crack down on dissent.He dissolved Guinea-Bissau's parliament after one attempted coup in December 2023 and the country has not had a sitting legislature since then.On Friday, Guinea-Bissau's transitional leader Gen Horta N'Tam appointed Ilidio Vieira Té, previously the finance minister, as the new prime minister.Additionally, the African Union suspended Guinea-Bissau's membership on Friday because of the unconstitutional military takeover, AFP reports. The West African bloc Ecowas took a similar action, while urging the military to return to the barracks.Guinea-Bissau is a coup-prone West African nation which is also strained by drug trafficking. The military said they were taking power to thwart a plot by unnamed politicians who had \"the support of a well-known drug baron\" to destabilise the country.A mother of three told the BBC that it was not the first military takeover she had lived through, but had nonetheless come as a surprise as people were expecting to hear about the outcome of the election, which had an estimated voter turnout of more than 65%.\"We heard gunfire. We ran away. We tried to pack our bags to go home,\" she said.Another resident of the capital, Bissau, said he was unhappy about the situation.\"This doesn't help anyone because it puts the country into chaos,\" Mohamed Sylla told the BBC.But reactions have been mixed, with some residents praising the army and hoping for an orderly transition.\"I am not against the military regime as long as they improve the living conditions in the country,\" Suncar Gassama told the BBC.",

    "body": "Venezuela has accused US President Donald Trump of making a \"colonialist threat\" after he said the airspace around the country should be considered closed.  The country's foreign ministry called Trump's comments \"another extravagant, illegal and unjustified aggression against the Venezuelan people\".The US does not legally have the authority to close another country's airspace, but Trump's online post could lead to travel uncertainty and deter airlines from operating there. The US has been building its military presence in the Caribbean, which officials say is to combat drug smuggling. Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has dismissed US claims of drug trafficking as an attempt to oust him. In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: \"To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY\".The White House did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment. Trump's comments come days after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned airlines of \"heightened military activity in and around Venezuela\".Venezuela on Wednesday banned six major international airlines – Iberia, TAP Portugal, Gol, Latam, Avianca and Turkish Airlines – from landing there after they failed to meet a 48-hour deadline to resume flights.The US has deployed the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, and about 15,000 troops to within striking distance of Venezuela.It has insisted that the deployment – the largest by the US in the region since it invaded Panama in 1989 – is to combat drug trafficking.On Thursday, Trump warned that US efforts to halt Venezuelan drug trafficking \"by land\" would begin \"very soon\". US forces have carried out at least 21 strikes on boats they said were carrying drugs, killing more than 80 people. However, the US has not provided evidence that the boats carried drugs. The Venezuelan government believes the aim of the US action is to depose Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced by the Venezuelan opposition and many foreign nations as rigged.The US has also designated Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns – a group it alleges is headed by Maduro – as a foreign terrorist organisation.Labelling an organisation as a terrorist group gives US law enforcement and military agencies broader powers to target and dismantle it.Venezuela's foreign ministry has \"categorically, firmly, and absolutely rejected\" the designation.Venezuela's interior and justice minister Diosdado Cabello, who is alleged to be one of the high-ranking members of the cartel, has long called it an \"invention\".The US state department has insisted that the Cartel de los Soles not only exists, but that it has \"corrupted Venezuela's military, intelligence, legislature, and judiciary\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoJessica RawnsleyGetty ImagesSearch and rescue operations are ongoing across Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Sri Lanka, with hundreds still missingTorrential rains have triggered floods and landslides across parts of southern Asia, killing about 600 people.Monsoon rain exacerbated by tropical storms caused some of the region's worst flooding in years, with millions affected in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Sri Lanka.Intense rainfall began on the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Wednesday. \"During the flood, everything was gone,\" a resident of Bireuen in Sumatra's Aceh province told Reuters news agency. \"I wanted to save my clothes, but my house came down.\" With hundreds still missing, the death toll is likely to rise. Thousands remain stranded, some awaiting rescue on rooftops.As of Saturday more than 300 people had died in Indonesia and 160 in Thailand. There were also several deaths reported in Malaysia.In Sri Lanka, which has been battered by Cyclone Ditwah, more than 130 people are dead and some 170 missing, officials said.Getty ImagesIn Indonesia hundreds are still missing after heavy rains wreaked havoc on the island of SumatraAn exceptionally rare tropical cyclone, named Cyclone Senyar, caused catastrophic landslides and flooding in Indonesia, with homes swept away and thousands of buildings submerged.Indonesia's disaster agency said on Saturday that nearly 300 people were still missing after flooding devastated Sumatra.\"The current was very fast, in a matter of seconds it reached the streets, entered the houses,\" a resident in Aceh Province, Arini Amalia, told the BBC. She and her grandmother raced to a relative's house on higher terrain. On returning the following day to retrieve some belongings, she said the flood had completely swallowed the house: \"It's already sunk.\"After waters rapidly rose in West Sumatra and submerged his home, Meri Osman said he was \"swept away by the current\" and clung onto a clothesline until he was rescued.The bad weather has hampered rescue operations, and while tens of thousands of people have been evacuated, hundreds are still stranded, the Indonesian disaster agency said.Getty ImagesTens of thousands of people have taken refuge in shelters in ThailandIn Thailand's southern Songkhla province, water rose 3m (10ft) and at least 145 people died in one of the worst floods in a decade.Across the 10 provinces hit by flooding, more than 160 people have been killed, the government said on Saturday. More than 3.8 million people have been affected.The city of Hat Yai experienced 335mm of rainfall in a single day, the heaviest in 300 years. As waters receded, officials recorded a sharp rise in the death toll. At one hospital in Hat Yai, employees were forced to move bodies to refrigerated trucks after the morgue became overwhelmed, news agency AFP reported.\"We were stuck in the water for seven days and no agency came to help,\" Hat Yai resident Thanita Khiawhom told BBC Thai.The government has promised relief measures, including compensation of up to two million baht ($62,000) for households that lost family members. Getty ImagesSri Lanka's government has declared a state of emergency and appealed for international assistanceIn neighbouring Malaysia, the death toll is far lower, but the damage is just as devastating.Flooding has wreaked havoc and left parts of northern Perlis state under water, with two people dead and tens of thousands forced into shelters.Sri Lanka is also grappling with one of its worst weather disasters in recent years, and the government has declared a state of emergency.More than 15,000 homes have been destroyed and some 78,000 people forced into temporary shelters, officials said. They added that about a third of the country was without electricity or running water.Meteorologists have said the extreme weather in South East Asia may have been caused by the interaction of Typhoon Koto in the Philippines and the rare formation of Cyclone Senyar in the Malacca Strait.The region's annual monsoon season, typically between June and September, often brings heavy rain.Climate change has altered storm patterns, including the intensity and duration of the season, resulting in heavier rainfall, flash flooding and stronger winds.More on this story",

    "body": "11 hours agoNatasha Booty,Chris Ewokor,AbujaandChiagozie Nwonwu,LagosThe Nigerian government says jihadist groups Boko Haram and Islamic State in West Africa Province (Iswap) are behind the recent wave of abductions in north-western and central Nigeria, but this has been disputed by analysts who tell the BBC they were committed by criminal gangs locally known as \"bandits\".This is the first time the government has stated who it believes is responsible for the kidnappings but it has not revealed any evidence to back its claims.Kidnap for ransom has become big business in parts of Nigeria in recent years - with the culprits ranging from kidnap gangs, jihadists and separatists.It is a lucrative money-spinner but officials consistently deny paying ransoms.In the past fortnight alone, there have been three mass kidnappings in the region:17 November - in Maga, Kebbi state, at Government Girls Comprehensive secondary school. Two people were killed and 25 abducted including one teacher - now all free18 November - in Eruku, Kwara state, at Christ Apostolic Church. Two were killed and 38 abducted - all since freed21 November - in Papiri, Niger state, at St Mary's Catholic School. More than 250 children and 12 members of staff reportedly kidnapped, although officials question these figuresPaying ransoms has been made illegal in Nigeria, although there are allegations this ban has been widely ignored.Speaking to the BBC, presidential spokesman Sunday Dare would not say whether money had been paid to free the minority of abductees who were recently released, simply stating: \"Whatever processes are involved - kinetic, non-kinetic, negotiations, etc - have been successful.\"Asked who was behind the kidnappings, he replied: \"Abundant data - both nationally and internationally - reveals clearly that Iswap are all over the place. Also, whatever is left of Boko Haram, they are right there,\" he continued. \"They are the ones involved in this process.\"Iswap is a splinter group of Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which has been waging an insurgency in north-eastern Nigeria for more than a decade.Mr Dare also reiterated President Bola Tinubu's promise to ensure the remaining abductees would be rescued, but failed to give assurances on how long it would take.In some of the worst cases in the past, kidnapped children have died at the hands of their captors - or been held for years on end, as in the case of the infamous Chibok kidnappings by Boko Haram.Analyst Bulama Bukarti told the BBC he did not agree with the government's claims that jihadist groups were behind the recent wave of kidnappings.\"I don't think that's accurate. There is no Iswap or Boko Haram cell resident in the north-west. The recent kidnappings, including the mass abductions, were carried out by bandits, not Boko Haram or Iswap,\" he said.The bandits are local armed groups, often on motorbikes, with no central organisation, who operate mainly in the north-west. Whereas Boko Haram and Iswap mainly operate hundreds of miles away, in Nigeria's north-east.The BBC asked Acled - an international monitoring group that analyses attacks by armed groups - to assess the three kidnappings.Acled said in all three cases Fulani militia groups, locally called \"bandits\", were responsible for the kidnappings.Fulani herders have come into conflict with both Muslim and Christian communities across Nigeria.It said the biggest of the recent kidnappings, in which more than 200 schoolchildren were reportedly abducted from St Mary's Catholic School, \"appears to have been partly carried out to spite the government and achieve some political objectives\".The church attack in southern Kwara state was \"part of the Fulani expansionist drive, and as a way to displace the locals from the communities for illegal mining activities\", Acled told the BBC. \"Local displacement for mining has become the emerging pattern of the Fulani militia activities as seen in Zamfara state and the Birnin Gwari area of Kaduna state.\"Shortly after the mass kidnappings in north-western and central Nigeria, 13 teenage girls were abducted in north-eastern Borno state, the stronghold of Boko Haram. Analysts agree that this is likely to have been the work of jihadist groups.Nigeria's security crisis has been thrown into the international spotlight in recent weeks after US President Donald Trump threatened to send over troops \"guns a-blazing\" if the government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\". Nigerian officials and analysts say that members of all faiths are victims of the violence and kidnappings, and say it is not true that Christians are being targeted.",

    "body": "13 hours agoYang TianandJames FitzGeraldWatch: Trump announces death of National Guard member Sarah BeckstromThe Trump administration has halted all asylum decisions following the shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington DC, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) director has said.Joseph Edlow said the pause would be in place \"until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible\".It came hours after US President Donald Trump pledged to \"permanently pause migration\" from all \"third world countries\".The flurry of immigration decisions come in the wake of Wednesday's shooting, which left one soldier dead and another in a critical condition, and which officials have accused an Afghan national for perpetrating.While the first of these specifically targeted Afghans seeking to enter the US, other decisions have been far more wide-reaching.The USCIS - a branch of the Department of Homeland Security - has been told not to approve, deny or close asylum applications it receives for all nationalities, according CBS News, the BBC's US partner.Its officers can continue to work on asylum applications and review cases up to the point of making a decision, CBS reported.But few details are known about Friday's directive.Trump did not name which countries might be affected by his migration pause, which could face legal challenges and has already prompted pushback from UN agencies.The US president's recent announcements represent a further toughening of his stance towards migrants during his second presidency.Trump has also sought to enact mass deportations of illegal migrants, cut the annual number of refugee admissions, and to end automatic citizenship rights currently applicable to many born on US territory.Following Wednesday's fatal attack, the Trump administration temporarily stopped issuing visas to Afghans through the same programme the shooting suspect had, before suspending all immigration requests from Afghans pending a review.Then on Thursday, the USCIS said it would re-examine green cards issued to individuals who had migrated to the US from 19 countries, without mentioning Wednesday's attack.The agency referred to a June proclamation that included Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Somalia and Venezuela. Details on what re-examination would look like were not provided.Trump then pledged to \"end all federal benefits and subsidies to non-citizens\" on Thursday. 'Third-world countries'Trump blamed refugees for causing the \"social dysfunction in America\" and vowed to remove \"anyone who is not a net asset\" to the US.\"Hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia were completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota,\" he said.\"I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover.\"The phrase \"third world\" is one previously used to describe poorer, developing nations. Earlier this year, a travel ban was imposed on nationals primarily from 11 African and Asian nations, including Afghanistan. During Trump's first term, he enacted a travel ban targeting multiple Muslim-majority countries.The UN has urged the US to observe international agreements on asylum seekers, news agency Reuters reported.Trump's reaction to the shooting amounted to a \"scapegoating\" of migrants in the US, argued Jeremy McKinney, the former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.He told the BBC World Service's Newsday programme before Trump's latest remarks that the attacker's motive were unclear, and that radicalisation and mental illness could affect anyone. \"These types of issues - they don't know skin colour, they don't know nationality.\"Suspect in DC shooting is AfghanOfficials said the shooting suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, came to the US in 2021.He travelled under a programme that offered special protections to Afghans who had worked with US forces in Afghanistan before their chaotic withdrawal and the return to power of the Taliban. Mr Lakanwal had been a member of a \"Zero Unit\" - an Afghan intelligence and paramilitary force that worked with the CIA - a former Afghan defence and security forces member told CBS.The US considered Zero Units to be among the most respected domestic forces in Afghanistan.The CIA's current director has confirmed that he previously worked with the US intelligence agency.FBI: Suspect had relationship with 'partner forces' in AfghanistanHe would have been vetted by the US both when he started working with the CIA and when he travelled to the US, a senior US official told CNN.A childhood friend told the New York Times that Mr Lakanwal had experienced mental health issues after his work with his unit.Mr Lakanwal was reportedly granted asylum after Trump returned to office, having applied in 2024.But his request for a green card - which shows a person has permanent residence in the US - is pending, an official told CBS.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "'This was preventable': Anger and unanswered questions after Hong Kong fire2 days agoKoh EweandKelly NgVideo shows how fast fire spread in Hong Kong high-riseShock is giving way to anger in Hong Kong after a massive fire ripped through a densely populated subsidised housing estate on Wednesday, killing at least 128 people and critically injuring dozens.Authorities say substandard mesh and plastic sheets on the buildings' windows may have spread the blaze, which raged for more than a day.Firefighting operations have now ended, with dozens of residents still unaccounted for.Questions are mounting as to how the fire at Wang Fuk Court spread so rapidly and who is responsible, with many calling it a \"man-made disaster\".Three people in charge of renovating the blocks are under arrest for manslaughter, and authorities have launched a corruption inquiry.A post that has gone viral on social media in the wake of the blaze reads: \"It's not an accident.\"Several residents have revealed in interviews that the fire alarm did not sound when the fire broke out. Authorities said on Friday that they had checked the fire alarms in all eight blocks and found that they were not working properly. Kiko Ma, who owns an apartment at Wang Fuk Court, says the alarms had been turned off amid renovation works, as construction workers regularly used fire escapes to get in and out of the building. Ms Ma lives in Canada with her family, but visits the Hong Kong apartment several times a year.\"This was preventable... A lot of people did not do their duties,\" the 33-year-old tells the BBC, claiming that the renovation firm used \"poor quality, flammable materials\".Residents often saw construction workers smoking and found cigarette butts along their window ledges, she adds.\"People kept asking what would happen if there was a fire. Everyone was very worried about this.\"Getty ImagesThe blaze spread rapidly and went on for more than a day in some blocksThis is Hong Kong's deadliest fire in at least 63 years - already having surpassed the toll of the August 1962 inferno in the Sham Shui Po neighbourhood, which killed 44 people and displaced hundreds.Built in the 1980s, Wang Fuk Court in Hong Kong's north-eastern Tai Po district comprises eight 31-storey buildings, seven of which went up in flames. The apartments here are sold at subsidised prices, but day-to-day affairs in the estate are managed by privately appointed firms.According to the 2021 census, the complex was home to about 4,600 people - nearly 40% of whom were 65 or older. The city's fire department on Thursday said firefighters faced major challenges trying to rescue residents, including high temperatures, the risk of further scaffolding collapse, and the small and crowded interiors of the apartments.Hong Kong is well-known for its tiny, densely packed inner-city dwellings, where many public rental housing tenants have, on average, a living space of just 14.1 square metres. It is unclear how many people were in Wang Fuk Court when the fire broke out, but the more recent census figures suggest it is home to around 4,600  residents. Hundreds of them have been evacuated to temporary shelters, and some are being allocated emergency housing units.Police are investigating whether mesh netting, plastic and canvas sheets used during renovations met fire safety standards. In a presser on Friday they attributed the rapid spread of the fire to styrofoam blocks placed outside the windows of the apartments, apparently to \"protect\" them from the debris and dust.Some experts also believe the bamboo scaffolding connecting the apartment blocks helped fuel the inferno. Such scaffolding is an iconic sight across Hong Kong, and widely used in construction.Earlier this year, authorities announced plans to phase out bamboo in favour of sturdier, fire-resistant steel, citing bamboo's combustibility and deterioration over time.Getty ImagesHundreds of residents have been evacuated to temporary shelters while emergency housing units are being allocated to someResidents at Wang Fuk Court had expressed unease about renovation plans when they were announced last year. Reports of those concerns have now resurfaced online, sparking accusations around a lack of transparency.Another homeowner who was abroad when the fire broke out said the plans were \"fundamentally shady\". \"[Those in charge] used small favours to encourage unsuspecting elderly residents to support their plans,\" they wrote in a comment on Instagram.Mr Lai, a sales associate who the BBC agreed to refer to by his last name only, says Wang Fuk Court residents had earlier questioned the high cost of renovation works. Calls from some residents to re-elect the estate's management committee went unheeded, he added. This week's fire is not an isolated incident, Mr Lai said, claiming that construction companies \"often prioritise cost efficiency\" over safety. He noted that a building in Hong Kong's Central district went up in flames last month after its bamboo scaffolding caught fire.\"When similar incidents happen, they raise the question of whether [there are] systemic weaknesses.\"Hong Kong authorities on Thursday ordered inspections of all housing estates undergoing \"major repairs\" to check for the \"safety of scaffolding and building materials\".",

    "body": "18 hours agoAna FaguyWashingtonWatch: How the shooting of two National Guard members unfoldedTwo members of the National Guard were shot and seriously wounded on Wednesday just blocks from the White House in Washington DC. One died on Thursday while the second remains in a critical condition, US President Donald Trump said the following day. The suspect, an Afghan national, is in custody. In response to the attack, Trump said he would deploy another 500 troops to the streets of the nation's capital. What happened in the shooting near the White House?Just after 14:00 EST (19:00 GMT) on Wednesday, two members of the National Guard, both from West Virginia, were shot at close range near Farragut Square in downtown Washington DC. The soldiers had been on a high-visibility patrol near the corner of 17th and I streets, an area where many office workers mill around at lunchtime. Metropolitan Police Assistant Chief Jeff Carroll said the suspect \"came around the corner\" and \"immediately started firing\", adding that the soldiers had been \"ambushed\".Muriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington DC, said the incident was a targeted attack. The location of the shooting, just blocks from the White House, meant a number of law enforcement officials were quickly on the scene to treat the two victims and apprehend the gunman. The guard members were taken to hospital, where one later died. Trump was at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida ahead of the US Thanksgiving holiday and not at the White House at the time.Patel: National Guard members 'brazenly attacked' and in critical conditionWhat do we know about the victims?The victims have been named as Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24 - both uniformed members of the West Virginia National Guard. Ms Beckstrom died on Thursday, Trump said while on a Thanksgiving call with US service members.He said Mr Wolfe remains in critical condition after being shot multiple times. ReutersAttorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News that Ms Beckstrom had volunteered to work in the nation's capital over the Thanksgiving holiday.\"She volunteered, as did many of those guardsmen and women, so other people could be home with their families,\" she said.What do we know about the suspect?The Department of Homeland Security named the suspect as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, and described him as \"a criminal alien from Afghanistan\".During his apprehension, the suspect was shot four times, law enforcement sources told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.ReutersMr Lakanwal is 29 years old and not co-operating with authorities, officials said.He is said to have come to the US in 2021. He lived with his wife and five children on the other side of the country, in the state of Washington.How did he come to the US?Mr Lakanwal reportedly came to the US in September 2021, under a programme for Afghans named Operation Allies Welcome that existed during the presidency of Joe Biden. This was during the time period that followed a chaotic withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan. As the Taliban took back control of the country, there were fears of retribution against those who had co-operated with the US.The Congressional Research Service has estimated that around 77,000 Afghans entered the US under special immigration protections, in place for about a year following the US withdrawal.Mr Lakanwal had a relationship in Afghanistan with the US forces, FBI Director Kash Patel said. CIA Director John Ratcliffe said he had worked with the intelligence agency.Mr Lakanwal applied for asylum in 2024, and his application was granted earlier this year, an official told CBS. What will he be charged with? The US attorney for Washington DC, Jeanine Pirro, said the initial charges of assault against the suspect will be upgraded to murder in the first degree.Initially, the administration had announced that Mr Lakanwal would be charged with three counts of assault with intent to kill while armed, along with possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. \"It is a premeditated murder. There was an ambush with a gun toward people who didn't know what was coming,\" Pirro told Fox and Friends on Friday. \"And that is the homicide, and that is the murder that we're looking at right now.\"Watch: Police chief describes how shooting of National Guard members unfoldedHow has the Trump administration responded?Just hours after the shooting, Trump posted a video speaking from Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida. He described the shooting as an \"act of terror\" and \"a crime against humanity\". Trump said he would deploy an additional 500 National Guardsmen to Washington DC - where there are currently nearly 2,200 troops.National Guard troops are a reservist force that can be activated to serve as military troops, but have limited power as they cannot enforce the law or make arrests.Trump deployed troops in August to tackle what he called \"out of control\" crime in the nation's capital.Overall crime in the nation's capital has fallen since the force was sent, which Trump credits to the troops' presence on the streets.The Trump administration has also highlighted the suspect's background, and announced a range of measures aimed at toughening the US approach to migration from Afghanistan and other nations.On Wednesday, the day of the shooting, it suspended processing all immigration requests from Afghans.The next day, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said it would re-examine green cards [permanent US residence cards] issued to individuals who migrated to the US from 19 countries.And Trump went on to say he would \"permanently pause migration\" to the US from all \"third-world countries\" - using a term that was used in the past to describe poorer, developing nations.On Friday in a post on X, USCIS director Joseph Edlow said the Trump administration would halt asylum decisions for all nationalities \"until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible\".",

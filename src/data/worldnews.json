    "body": "7 hours agoJack BurgessReutersVenezuelan opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa has announced on social media that he has been freed after \"almost nine months of unjust imprisonment\". His comments come shortly after the country's interim President, Delcy Rodríguez, signed an amnesty bill approved by its National Assembly that could lead to the release of hundreds of political prisoners. Rodríguez's interim government has faced pressure from the US to speed up the release of Venezuela's remaining political prisoners after delays to the law. However, Guanipa described the bill as a \"flawed document\" that excludes many Venezuelans who remain \"unjustly\" behind bars. Guanipa is the leader of Venezuela's centre-right Justice First party and was a former vice-president of the National Assembly.Venezuela's socialist government has always denied holding political prisoners but first announced days after Maduro's capture, on 8 January, that \"a significant number\" of prisoners would be freed as a goodwill gesture.Opposition and human rights groups have said the government under Maduro for years used detentions of political prisoners to stamp out dissent and silence critics.Interim President Rodriguez has described the amnesty bill as being intended for the offering and receiving of forgiveness.Meanwhile, exiled opposition figurehead Edmundo González wrote on social media on Friday that there would be \"no lasting reconciliation without memory or responsibility\" in Venezuela. He added that a \"legitimate\" amnesty must come with \"truth, recognition and reparation\".Activists within the South American country have denounced delays to the amnesty law and a lack of transparency over who is being freed.",

    "body": "4 hours agoLas Vegas Metropolitan Police DepartmentA woman has been charged with animal abandonment after she allegedly left her two-year-old dog at a Las Vegas airport, police have said. Officers found the golden doodle/mini poodle tied to a baggage sizer at Harry Reid International Airport after being alerted by other travellers. The animal's owner was stopped at a departure gate. The police said the dog was taken in by Animal Protective Services, but as the owner never returned a charity later took custody of the animal. The charity said it has been inundated with applications to adopt the dog, who authorities have nicknamed him Jet Blue as he was abandoned at the airline's ticket counter. Video of the incident appears to show a woman, who has not been named, walking up to the ticket counter with her dog and speaking to airline staff, before walking away leaving the dog on a leash on 2 February.She was told by airline staff that she did not have the required documents to travel with the animal as a service dog and was subsequently denied a boarding pass, police said. After leaving the dog, she went to a departure gate which is where officers found her.\"When asked why she abandoned the dog, she stated the airline would not allow her to fly with it and claimed the dog had a tracking device - implying it was acceptable to leave the animal behind and it would return to her,\" Las Vegas police said in a statement. They added that \"she became hostile and resisted officers' attempts to detain her\".The woman was also charged with resisting arrest, police said. \"We can't believe we have to say this... but please don't abandon your dog at the airport - or anywhere else,\" police said in the Facebook post.The golden doodle/mini poodle was placed in Animal Protective Services for 10 days, a mandatory period to allow the owner to retrieve the dog.  As the woman never returned the dog was placed in foster care.The charity, Retriever Rescue of Las Vegas, said it had received \"so many applications and inquiries\" about Jet Blue. ",

Local authorities have been trying to step up efforts to get a grip on the issue by using methods such as surveillance cameras to catch culprits.\"Ingenuity can never become an alibi for incivility,\" the municipality of Catania said in a post on its official Facebook page.\"Respect for urban etiquette and the environment is everyone's duty,\" it added.The post did not say whether any action had been taken.",

    "body": "3 hours agoRebecca Morelle,Science Editor,Alison Francis,Senior Science JournalistandGreg Brosnan,Senior Science JournalistShutterstockThe astronauts will begin their journey on Nasa's Space Launch System rocket Nasa is targeting early March to launch a crew around the Moon for the first time in more than 50 years, in what would be humankind's furthest trip into space.The Artemis II mission will see four astronauts embark on a 10-day journey around the far side of the Moon and back to Earth, paving the way for a future lunar landing.Nasa set the earliest launch date of March 6 (early on March 7 in the UK) following a successful \"wet dress rehearsal\" - a critical pre-launch test where the rocket is filled with fuel and taken through the countdown sequence.It was the Artemis team's second attempt at a practice run at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\"Every night I look up at the Moon and I see it and I get real excited because I can feel she's calling us and we're ready,\" Nasa's Lori Glaze told a news conference on Friday.\"The excitement for Artemis II is really, really starting to build, we can really start to feel it. It's coming.\"The first rehearsal, which took place at the beginning of February, ended early because of a hydrogen fuel leak at the launch pad.Glaze said issues including with seals and filters had now been remedied.\"Yesterday we were able to fully tank the SLS rocket within the planned time line […] we also succesfully demonstrated the launch countdown,\" she said.Three Americans - Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch - and one Canadian, Jeremy Hansen, make up the Artemis II crew.Glaze said the crew were excited following the successful rehearsal and would go into quarantine later on Friday.They'll begin their journey on Nasa's mega Moon rocket: the 98m-tall (322ft) Space Launch System, or SLS.It's only flown once before in November 2022 for the Artemis I mission, but this was with no people onboard.The crew will be strapped into the Orion capsule, which is located at the top of the rocket.The inside of their spacecraft is about the size of a minibus, and it's where the four will live, eat, work and sleep during the 10-day mission.The first day of their journey will be spent in orbit around the Earth, then if all systems are working well, the astronauts will head towards the Moon.The voyage takes about four days, and the crew will travel around the far side of the Moon, which is the side we never see from Earth.They'll be at a distance of 6,500-9,500km (4,000 to 6,000 miles) above the lunar surface, and will have several hours dedicated to studying and taking images of the Moon.After the fly by, the astronauts will begin their four-day journey home. They will end the mission with a splash down in the Pacific Ocean.NASAApollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmitt visited the Moon in 1972The mission, if successful, will pave the way for Artemis III, which will see astronauts set foot on the lunar surface. The last time humans visited the Moon was in 1972 for the Apollo 17 mission.Nasa says the landing will happen by 2028, but this is a very ambitious timescale.Elon Musk's SpaceX company has a contract to build the lander for Artemis III - which will be flown to the Moon on a SpaceX Starship rocket. But delays to the Starship rocket have led Nasa to ask SpaceX for a new streamlined plan to speed a return to the Moon.Nasa has also asked rival company Blue Origin - which is owned by Jeff Bezos - to come up with an accelerated lunar plan for Artemis III.As the tech billionaires battle it out, the US is under pressure to return to the Moon. China is aiming for a lunar landing by 2030, and has been making steady progress towards this.Both nations are planning to land at the Moon's south pole - and are competing for the best spots to build their lunar bases.",

    "body": "Mystery donor gives Japanese city $3.6m in gold bars to fix water system17 hours agoKoh EweOsaka City Waterworks BureauOsaka authorities received 21kg of gold bullion from a mystery donorA Japanese city has received a hefty donation to help fix its ageing water system: 21kg (46lb) in gold bars.The gold bars, worth an estimated 560 million yen ($3.6m; £2.7m), were given last November by a donor who wished to remain anonymous, Osaka Mayor Hideyuki Yokoyama told a press conference on Thursday.Home to nearly three million people, Osaka is a commercial hub located in the Japan's Kansai region and the country's third-largest city.But like many Japanese cities, Osaka's water and sewage pipes are ageing - a growing cause for safety concern.Osaka recorded more than 90 cases of water pipe leaks under its roads in the 2024 fiscal year, according to the city's waterworks bureau.\"Tackling ageing water pipes requires a huge investment. So I have nothing but appreciation,\" Yokoyama told reporters on Thursday, in response to a question about the huge gold donation.Yokoyama said the amount was \"staggering\" and he was \"lost for words\".The same mystery donor had previously given 500,000 yen in cash for municipal waterworks, he added.The city's waterworks bureau said in a statement on Thursday that it was grateful for the gold donation and would put it to good use - including tackling the deterioration of water pipes.More than 20% of Japan's water pipes have passed their legal service life of 40 years, according to local media.Sinkholes have also become increasingly common in Japanese cities, many of which have ageing sewage pipeline infrastructure.Last year, a massive sinkhole in Saitama Prefecture swallowed the cab of a truck, killing its driver. The sinkhole was believed to have been caused by a ruptured sewage pipe.That incident prompted Japanese authorities to step up efforts to replace corroded pipes across the country. But budget issues have stalled the progress of such pipe renewal works.",

The accused are in custody and haven't commented publicly yet.According to the National Crime Records Bureau, more than 2,500 people, mostly women, were killed in India on suspicion of witchcraft between 2000 and 2016.Mohammad Sartaj Alam/BBCThe murders occurred in the Kudsai hamlet of Jharkhand stateSuch cases are often reported from areas inhabited by disadvantaged tribal communities, where superstition is rife and a non-existent public health system leads to dependence on quacks for medical advice.The murders in Jharkhand occurred in the Kudsai hamlet, a remote tribal settlement of around 50 mud houses located 250km (155.3 miles) from the state capital, Ranchi.​The violence appears to have been triggered by recent incidents in the village, including rumours of sudden cattle deaths and the illness and death of a local man named Pustun Birua.His wife Jano Birua says she consulted an informal healthcare provider - common in villages where no doctors are available - when he began suffering from anxiety and fainting spells. He told her that her husband was not suffering from any physical illness.Asked why she did not take him to a hospital, she said: \"We are poor people, so it wasn't possible to take him that far.\"Meanwhile, rumours spread that Jyoti Sinku was practising witchcraft and was responsible for the man's illness.Pustun Birua died on Tuesday evening. That night, according to Jyoti's husband Kolhan Sinku who is in hospital, a mob of about a dozen people, including five women, stormed their home and set fire to his wife and child.Recalling the horror from his hospital bed, he said: ​\"I pleaded with folded hands to have the matter resolved in the village council but the attackers didn't listen to me.\"Based on the testimonies of Kolhan Sinku and another family member, the district police have registered a complaint of murder and criminal conspiracy.Police say four men have been arrested and a special police team has been set up to track down other members of the mob.They added that they would organise programmes in rural areas to raise awareness against superstitions.",

    "body": "19 hours agoBen KingBusiness reporterAFP via Getty ImagesEMI Records was one of the major players of the music industryWarning: this article contains offensive and derogatory languageJeffrey Epstein considered investing in music company EMI after his associate David Stern appeared to suggest it potentially offered access to women, recently released emails suggest.Epstein replied that he was interested, adding: \"Do we need help - mandelson? [sic]\"Stern and Lord Mandelson did not reply to requests for comment.Many of his emails to Epstein flagged potential deals, and in February 2010 he forwarded a short news article about the financial woes of EMI at the time. EMI is a now-defunct conglomerate that included EMI Records, formerly one of the major players of the music industry. It was acquired by Universal Music in 2012.\"Troubled industry but related to P,\" Stern wrote to Epstein.\"P\", which Epstein apparently used to refer to women, is believed to be an abbreviation of the word \"pussy\", another term Epstein often used.For birthdays and New Year greetings, Stern wished Epstein \"lots of P\", according to the recently released files. He once offered to get Epstein fashion show tickets \"to review Chinese P\". He would send Epstein a \"P factor\" for the places he visited, giving the Spanish island Ibiza 9/10, and Sarah Ferguson's 50th birthday party 0.2/10.The emails have been newly released by the US Department of JusticeAt the time Epstein had considered asking Stern for his help in an EMI investment, Lord Mandelson was First Secretary of State and Business Secretary in the UK government.Stern said it was \"too early to get Mandelson involved before i know more\".Epstein appears to have emailed Lord Mandelson a few days later, saying: \"please email me bens contact info.. or havehim cal me re emi. [sic]\"In reply, Lord Mandelson appears to say: \"Gave to [redacted]. Email is [redacted]. Talk re EMI ??\".It's not clear exactly who \"ben\" is.Epstein sent another reply to Stern, suggesting that if the deal went ahead, he would put US businessman and former Sony Music company CEO Tommy Mottola in charge of it.He wrote, \"my friend is tommy mottola former head of sony I'd like him to be brought in to fix it\".Mottola did not reply to a request for comment. US Department of JusticeAn image from the Epstein files showing David Stern at the opening of a new office for his company Asia Gateway in Beijing in 2011Epstein's proposed deal did not go ahead – and EMI's main lender Citigroup ended up taking control of the company.However later on, in 2011, Epstein's circle were still discussing a bid for EMI.Kevin Law, a businessmen in the US state of Connecticut who was often in touch with Epstein, apparently wrote: \"Tell your buddy Andrew from the UK if he's interested in EMI as we discussed I can put him in the syndicate w KKR.\" It is not clear if Epstein's \"buddy\" referred to here is Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.PA MediaDavid Stern sits to the left of the Queen at a Pitch@Palace event at St James's Palace in London, in November 2016Law has said he \"never bid on EMI with any group nor did I ever do a business deal with Epstein,\" and said he did not know the former prince.The giant private equity firm KKR declined to comment. At the time KKR had a controlling stake in a rival record company, BMG.Stern was apparently still keen on acquiring a record company in 2011. He wrote: \"EMI may now come up for sale. Could actually be of interest to Chinese if structured properly. Also, most certainly great asset to have for P!\"However Epstein did not buy it then either.In November 2011, Citigroup split EMI into two parts and, the following year, sold it to Universal and a consortium involving Sony and record executive David Geffen.The DOJ files show other discussions between Epstein and associates about buying model agencies and fashion-related businesses, which also did not go ahead.French prosecutors have previously suspected that Epstein used his contact in the fashion industry, Jean-Luc Brunel, to house and transport young girls.More on this story",

    "body": "12 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinWatch: Obama gave \"classified information\" with alien comments, says TrumpUS President Donald Trump says he will direct US agencies, including the defence department, to \"begin the process of identifying and releasing\" government files on aliens and extraterrestrial life. Trump made the declaration in a post on Truth Social, after he accused Barack Obama earlier in the day of revealing classified information when the former president said \"aliens are real\" on a podcast last week. \"He's not supposed to be doing that,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding: \"He made a big mistake.\"Asked if he also thinks aliens are real, Trump answered: \"Well, I don't know if they're real or not.\"Former US President Obama told podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen that he thinks aliens are real in an interview released last Saturday. \"They're real, but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in Area 51,\" Obama said. \"There's no underground facility unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.\"After the comment made headlines, Obama sought to clarify he thinks it is statistically likely life exists beyond Earth, given the vastness of the universe. In a follow-up post on Instagram, Obama, who served as US president between 2009-17, clarified: \"I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!\" Obama's initial comments were made during a quickfire \"lightning\" round of questions on the podcast.There was no indication that Obama relied on classified information when he gave the interview. The BBC has contacted Obama for comment. The Democrat and Trump, a Republican, are longstanding mutual political antagonists.For his part, Trump said on Thursday on Air Force One that while a lot of people believe in the existence of aliens, he never talks about it, and \"doesn't have an opinion on it\". Then a few hours later, he posted on Truth Social that \"based on the tremendous interest shown\" he will seek the release of files \"related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters\".The US has seen renewed public interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial life in recent years, sparked in 2017 by reports about a secret Pentagon programme to probe testimony from pilots and other US military members who had reported seeing strange objects in the sky.In 2022, Congress held the first hearings on UFOs in 50 years and the Pentagon promised more transparency on the matter - setting up a dedicated office to collect reports of all military UFO encounters.The following year, a US House of Representatives panel on the topic produced no major bombshells nor confirmation of alien life. In a 2024 report, the Pentagon said there was \"no evidence\" that the US government had encountered alien life, and that most UFO sightings were just ordinary objects. ",

    "body": "15 hours agoBernd Debusmann JrWhite House reporter Getty ImagesTrump told the Board of Peace, Trump said that talks with Iran have been 'very good' but historically difficult. US President Donald Trump says the world will find out \"over the next, probably, 10 days\" whether the US will reach a deal with Iran or take military action.At the first meeting of his Board of Peace in Washington DC, Trump said of negotiations with the Islamic Republic about its nuclear programme: \"We have to make a meaningful deal otherwise bad things happen.\" In recent days, the US has surged military forces to the Middle East, while progress was reported at talks between American and Iranian negotiators in Switzerland. The Iranian government has told the UN Secretary-General that it will regard US bases in the region as legitimate targets if used in any military aggression against Iran. Tehran's UN mission said in a letter to UN Secretary-General António Guterres that Trump's rhetoric signalled a real risk of an attack - but it said Iran did not want a war.Democratic lawmakers, and some Republicans, have voiced opposition to any potential military action in Iran without congressional approval.In his remarks, Trump noted that Special Envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who is also Trump's son-in-law, had \"some very good meetings\" with Iran. \"It's proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran,\" he said. \"Otherwise bad things happen.\" One day earlier, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt warned that Iran would be \"very wise\" to make a deal with the US, adding that Trump was still hoping for a diplomatic solution over Tehran's nuclear programme. When Trump first announced the Board of Peace, it was thought to be aimed at helping end the two-year war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and oversee reconstruction. But in the last month its mission has appeared to go beyond one conflict, with many wondering if the Trump-chaired board, made up of about two dozen countries, is meant to sideline the United Nations.US missile and aircraft struck three Iranian nuclear facilities in June last year, and the White House was reportedly discussing new attack options this week. American forces have been ramping up their presence in the region in recent weeks, including the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier.In previous military operations in the Middle East, the US used RAF Fairford, in Gloucestershire, and the UK overseas territory of Diego Garcia, in the Indian Ocean. Satellite images have also shown that Iran has reinforced military facilities, and the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei, has posted messages to social media threatening US forces. \"The US President constantly says that the US has sent a warship toward Iran. Of course, a warship is a dangerous piece of military hardware,\" one of Khamenei's posts read. \"However, more dangerous than that warship is the weapon that can send that warship to the bottom of the sea.\"Several members of US Congress have expressed opposition to any military action against Iran. California Democrat Ro Khanna and Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie have said they will try to force a vote on the matter next week, citing the 1973 War Powers Act. The act grants Congress the ability to check the president's power to commit the US to armed conflict.\"A war with Iran would be catastrophic,\" Khanna posted on social media. \"Iran is a complex society of 90 million people with significant air defences and military capabilities.\"He also said thousands of US troops in the region \"could be at risk of retaliation\".The chances of passage in both chambers of Congress are not strong.In January, Senate Republicans blocked a similar war powers resolution that would have required the Trump administration to obtain congressional approval before launching further military operations in Venezuela following the capture of Nicolas Maduro.",

    "body": "9 hours agoBethany BellBBC Vienna correspondentReutersThomas P, who cannot be identified under Austrian law, is appealing against the guilty verdictAn Austrian climber has been found guilty of gross negligent manslaughter after his girlfriend froze to death on Austria's highest mountain last year.The man, named only as Thomas P in line with Austrian privacy laws, has been given a five-month suspended sentence and fined €9,600 (£8,400).His girlfriend, Kerstin G, died of hypothermia during a climbing trip on the Grossglockner mountain in January 2025.In a statement sent to the BBC, the court said it considered Thomas P's previous clean record and the loss of a person close to him \"to be mitigating factors\". It said it also took into account \"the public discussion on social media, which was incriminating for the defendant\".The judge, Norbert Hofer, himself an experienced climber who works with mountain and helicopter rescue teams in Tyrol, said Thomas P was an excellent Alpinist, but that his girlfriend was light-years behind him in terms of her climbing abilities.He said the couple should have turned back as Kerstin G did not have enough experience in winter conditions.Although the judge decided Thomas P had misjudged the situation, he said he had not left her behind \"wilfully\": \"I don't see you as a murderer, I don't see you as cold-hearted.\"The court also heard from Andrea B, a former girlfriend of Thomas P, who described how he had left her alone on a previous tour on the Grossglockner in 2023. She said she had been at the end of her tether, feeling dizzy and her headlight had gone out. She said she was crying and screaming when he suddenly disappeared, walking ahead and leaving her behind.Grossglockner mountain in AustriaThe judge also questioned Thomas P's account of how he had left Kerstin on the mountainside. Hofer suggested instead that, based on her position in the photos taken by the rescue team, she may have had a fall.The court heard how the mountain rescue team found her body hanging upside down from a rock face, according to Austrian reports.\"We were amazed that she remained in that position,\" one of the rescuers told the court. If the wind had been any stronger, \"she would have fallen over the south face\".The prosecution said there were strong winds of up to 74 km/h (45 mph), and it was very cold. It was -8C, with a windchill temperature of -20C, they said.They argued that as the more experienced climber, Thomas P was \"the responsible guide for the tour\". They said he failed to turn back or call for help in time to help his girlfriend.Thomas P should never have allowed himself to get into this situation, the prosecutor said.Thomas P pleaded not guilty. He told the court he was deeply sorry. He said he had loved his girlfriend, who was very sporty and that they had planned the trip together.His lawyer Kurt Jelinek said the couple had found themselves in a really difficult and stressful situation.He said Kerstin G was not inexperienced and knew what she was getting into.Her parents told the court she had been \"really active\" in mountaineering since 2020, and her mother said she would not have \"gone along blindly\".Forensic pathologist Claudia Wöss confirmed to the court that she had died of hypothermia, adding that she had found evidence of viral pneumonia and the painkiller ibuprofen in Kerstin G's body. She was unable to assess whether her physical capacity had been impaired by the illness, and if it had made a sudden decline in her condition more likely.www.foto-webcam.euThis still from webcam footage shows the couple still climbing at 21:00 on 18 JanuaryProsecutors say the couple got stuck on the mountain and that Thomas P failed to call the police and did not send any distress signals when a police helicopter flew overhead at around 22:30.Video footage from the helicopter showed the couple still climbing. The judge noted that no distress signals were sent.The defence argued that at that point Thomas P and girlfriend still felt fine and did not call for help as they were close to the summit.Webcam images show lights from their torches as they scaled the mountain.But shortly afterwards, the defence said the situation changed dramatically, when Kerstin G became exhausted close to the summit.The defence said that she told Thomas P to go to get help.At 00:35 on 19 January, he called the mountain police. The content of the conversation is disputed. Rescuers said it wasn't an emergency call but the lawyer says he denies telling police that everything was fine.He scaled the summit and descended on the other side, leaving Kerstin G behind. Prosecutors say he left her at 02:00.Webcam images show his torch-lit figure coming down from the summit.The trial sparked interest and debate, not just in Austria but in mountain climbing communities far beyond its borders, raising questions about when personal judgement and risk-taking become a matter of criminal liability.The case is subject to appeal.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "13 hours agoAlpesh KarkareBBC MarathiSangram Patil/YouTubeSangram Patil is a consultant with the UK's National Health ServiceA British doctor has been unable to leave India for more than a month after police opened a case against him over a social media post about a top politician of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Sangram Patil, a UK citizen of Indian origin who works with the NHS, was stopped from taking a flight back to London from Mumbai on 19 January after a lookout circular was issued against him - a notice that prevents a person under investigation from leaving the country.He is being investigated for allegedly posting \"objectionable content\" about a BJP leader. Patil, who has a substantial following on Facebook and YouTube, has called the action against him \"unlawful\".It's not clear when the doctor will be allowed to go back to the UK. He has approached a court, seeking the police case registered against him be dropped and travel restrictions imposed on him be removed. The matter is due to be next heard on 27 February.\"My children and my job are in the UK. International law and Indian law give me the right to move freely. Restrictions have been imposed on that. I am not able to go home,\" he told BBC Marathi last week.The BBC has reached out to the Mumbai police, which is investigating the case, for a comment. A spokesperson from the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office did not offer specifics but said last week that they \"are supporting a British man in India and are in contact with the local authorities\".Police say they are investigating Patil over a complaint filed by Nikhil Bhamre, who handles BJP's social media in the western state of Maharashtra of which Mumbai is the capital.Bhamre's complaint, registered on 18 December, accuses Patil of publishing \"objectionable content\" against a top BJP leader on Facebook. The complaint did not name the BJP leader who was targeted, but it came four days after Patil had posted a comment about Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Facebook.The police complaint that BBC has seen a copy of contains a link to this post. According to the police complaint, Bhamre alleged that \"the post could create hostility between various groups that support and oppose the BJP's ideology\".Police registered a case against Patil under India's criminal code \"for making statements containing false information that could lead to a feeling of enmity and hatred between communities\". The offence is bailable and carries a maximum sentence of up to three years.Patil has rejected the allegations, saying it was \"unlawful to register such a complaint against me for that social media post\".\"My post is a simple question to government supporters and nothing else. It doesn't involve any community, any rumour or sensational news,\" Patil told BBC Marathi.He said he was first questioned for more than 10 hours when he arrived in Mumbai on 10 January with his wife, and again for eight hours on 16 January. He said he had provided \"written answers to all\" the police questions and asked for the lookout circular to be withdrawn so he could return to the UK on 19 January.He said officers told him the process to cancel the notice had been initiated, but he was stopped at the airport on the day of his flight.Being questioned for more than 20 hours over what he described as a single line on social media felt like \"targeted harassment\", he added.In an affidavit filed on 30 January, police defended the action against Patil saying the investigation was at a crucial stage and \"the possibility of an organised effort to malign constitutional authority cannot be ruled out\".\"It is a matter of serious concern, warranting investigation as to why a foreign citizen, despite being a qualified medical professional, visiting India on a Tourist e-Visa, has engaged in posting defamatory, scandalous, obscene and inflammatory material without any substance and basis against the prime minister of India while residing outside the country,\" the police told the court.They have also urged the court to dismiss Patil's \"misconceived and premature\" plea challenging the investigation against him. In a rejoinder filed in court last week, Patil denied the allegations. According to court filings reported by The Indian Express newspaper, he \"categorically denied\" writing any post naming or referring to the prime minister, adding that \"criminal prosecution cannot be founded on subjective political interpretation or perceived sentiment\".Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

Many tech leaders and politicians at the Summit have called for more global governance of AI, ahead of an expected joint statement as the event draws to a close.But the US has rejected this stance, with White House technology adviser Michael Kratsios saying: \"AI adoption cannot lead to a brighter future if it is subject to bureaucracies and centralised control.\"Sir Demis said it was important to build \"robust guardrails\" against the most serious threats from the rise of autonomous systems.He said the two main threats were the technology being used by \"bad actors\", and the risk of losing control of systems as they become more powerful.When asked whether he had the power to slow down the progress of the tech to give experts more time to work on its challenges, he said his firm had an important role to play, but was \"only one player in the ecosystem\".But he admitted keeping up with the pace of AI development was \"the hard thing\" for regulators. Sam Altman, the boss of OpenAI, also called for \"urgent regulation\" in a speech at the AI Summit, while Indian Prime Minster Narendra Modi said countries had to work together to benefit from AI.However, the US has taken the opposite view. \"As the Trump administration has now said many times: We totally reject global governance of AI,\" said the head of the US delegation Michael Kratsios.Sir Demis won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2024Delegates from more than 100 countries, including several world leaders, are attending the event. Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy MP represented the UK government. Mr Lammy said the power wasn't just with tech firms when it came to safety of AI and politicians need to work \"hand in hand\" with tech adding, \"security and safety must come first and it must be of benefit for the wider public\". Sir Demis believes the US and the west are \"slightly\" ahead in the race with China for AI dominance but added that it could be \"only a matter of months\" before China catches up.He said he felt the responsibility to balance being \"bold and responsible\" about deploying AI systems out in the world.\"We don't always get things right,\" he admitted, \"but we get it more correct than most\".Science education 'still very important'In the next 10 years the tech would become \"a superpower\" in terms of what people would be able to create, Sir Demis, who won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, said.\"I think it's still very important to have a Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) education,\" he added.\"If you have a technical background, I think it will still be an advantage in using these systems.\"He thinks AI writing code would open up the number of people who could build new applications, \"and then maybe the key thing becomes taste and creativity and judgement\".The AI Impact Summit is the largest ever global gathering of world leaders and tech bosses.  It ends on Friday with companies and countries expected to deliver a shared view of how to handle artificial intelligence.",

    "body": "20 hours agoRushdi AbualoufGaza correspondent, IstanbulReutersKhaled Meshaal, part of Hamas's \"old guard\", who has already led the group, is said to be one of the frontrunnersHamas is holding an election for a new interim leader, a senior Palestinian official familiar with the armed group's affairs has told the BBC.Voting is taking place across Gaza, the occupied West Bank and among Hamas's members elsewhere. The outcome may signal which direction the movement intends to take - particularly as the US and other mediators discuss post-war governance of Gaza, reconstruction efforts and the future status of armed groups there.The elections come after most of Hamas's senior leadership were killed in Israeli strikes following the group's 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage.People in Gaza have already cast their votes in secret, according to the source, but it is unclear whether the process has concluded elsewhere. When announced, the new leader will hold office for a year.Hamas governs the Gaza Strip and in recent years has had growing support in the West Bank, though its activities there are heavily constrained by the Israeli military and Palestinian Authority security forces.A US-backed ceasefire in Gaza came into effect in October, and negotiations continue over the deal's later phases.Under the proposed terms of the US plan, Hamas would have no role in the future governance of the territory. Governance would eventually be handed over to the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, once it has undergone reforms.Yahya Sinwar, the overall head of Hamas, was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza in October 2024, and its political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in an Israeli attack in Iran in July that year. Hamas's military chief Mohammed Deif was also killed that July, in an Israeli air strike on Gaza.The position of overall head of Hamas has remained vacant since the deaths of Haniyeh and Sinwar, with the movement being led by an interim committee headed by Qatar-based Mohammad Darwish after the latter was killed.Under the movement's rules, the head of Hamas is chosen by an electoral college of around 86 members drawn from the General Shura Council, Hamas's top decision-making body representing Gaza, the West Bank, Palestinian prisoners in Israel, and officials based abroad.According to the official, the race is primarily between:Khalil al-Hayya, who leads Hamas in Gaza and is widely seen as aligned with Sinwar and HaniyehKhaled Meshaal, the head of Hamas abroad and one of the movement's veteran figures, who previously served as its overall leader for nearly two decadesMeshaal is currently thought to reside in Doha, Qatar.Other internal discussions have included additional names, but no formal shortlist has been announced.Impact of warThe war that followed Hamas's 7 October attack has had a deep impact on the movement's internal politics. Israeli strikes have killed senior Hamas figures and significantly diminished the group's military and political structures, weakening the influence of its Gaza-based leadership.More than 72,000 people have been killed in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says, though it does not distinguish between civilians and fighters.For years, Hamas has been shaped by a persistent internal rivalry between two broad currents.One, often described as aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood, and represented by Meshaal and parts of the external leadership, is viewed by observers as more pragmatic and less ideologically rigid. The other was seen as closer to Iran, a vital Hamas ally that supplies financial backing and weaponry, and was represented most prominently by Sinwar and leaders inside Gaza.In 2017, when Haniyeh became head of the political bureau and Sinwar assumed leadership inside Gaza, decision-making shifted heavily towards the territory. The recent war, however, appears to have reopened space for figures from the movement's so-called \"old guard\", traditionally linked to Meshaal.Getty ImagesKhalil al-Hayya, seen here meeting Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in February, is considered ideologically close to Yahya SinwarUnder Hamas's internal regulations, its political leadership is composed of 18 members: six representing Gaza, six representing the West Bank and prisoners, and six representing Hamas abroad.Figures associated with the \"old guard\" appear to be regaining more prominence after years of Gaza-dominated decision making, according to officials familiar with the discussions.With Gaza devastated by years of conflict and its political landscape in flux, the selection of a new leader is seen as a critical step in determining how Hamas navigates mounting internal and external pressures in the year ahead.",

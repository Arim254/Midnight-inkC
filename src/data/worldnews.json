The resistance committee for El-Fasher, made up of local citizens and activists, said the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) hit Dar al-Arqam camp. located within a university, with two drone strikes and eight artillery shells. \"Children, women and the elderly were killed in cold blood, and many were completely burned,\" a statement from the group said, as quoted by AFP news agency. The RSF has surrounded El-Fasher for the last 17 months, in an attempt to take control of the Sudanese army's last stronghold in the Darfur region. The situation in El-Fasher has \"gone beyond disaster and genocide\", the resistance group said.Hunger and disease has spread across the city, as residents contend with constant bombardment and dwindling food and medical supplies.Sudan has been ravished by conflict since 2023, after top commanders of the RSF and Sudanese army fell out and a vicious power struggle ensued - creating one of the worst humanitarian crises.",

The statement by the Danish defence ministry says the purpose of its military is security, and if necessary, defence in the Nato security alliance.\"The task of the Armed Forces is to ensure security throughout the Kingdom - and, if necessary, to defend Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Denmark within the framework of Nato in all domains,\" the Chief of Defence, Michael Hyldgaard, told Danish public broadcaster DR, without saying who the potential adversaries were.Denmark worked on the new defence package with the governments of Greenland and the Faroe Islands.It will buy two new Arctic ships, maritime patrol planes, drones and early warning radar.Crucially, a new Arctic command headquarters will be set up in the Greenlandic capital, Nuuk, alongside a new military unit under Joint Arctic Command in Greenland.In addition, an undersea cable connecting Greenland and Denmark will be funded. The struggle for control of the Arctic is accelerating - and riskier than everGreenland in particular is strategically located between North America and Russia. Though the island has wide-ranging autonomy, it remains part of the kingdom of Denmark.In recent years, there has been increased interest in the vast island's natural resources, including mining for rare earth minerals, uranium and iron.Greenland lies on the shortest route from North America to Europe, making it strategically important for the US. The island has been home to a US radar base since the Cold War and also hosts a large American space facility.US President Donald Trump has suggested the island is crucial to military efforts to track Chinese and Russian ships, which he said are \"all over the place\".Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to acquire Greenland, saying the island was \"critical\" for national and economic security.Greenland's prime minister has said the territory is not for sale, adding that \"Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland\".",

But the usually barren landscape has been transformed by a carpet of colourful wildflowers, which have been brought to life by significant rainfall during the southern hemisphere's winter months.This is thought to be an event that only occurs every few years, when above average rainfall soaks the desert floor, causing dormant seeds to spring to life.Anadolu via Getty Images/Lucas Aguayo AraosAFP via Getty Images/Jose TorresThe Atacama desert typically receives less than 15mm of rain every year.But the area had more than 12mm of rain during August alone - most of which fell on just one day.The desert even saw a rare blanket of snow back in June.AFP via Getty Images/Jose TorresThis magnificent bloom is made up of more than 200 different species of wildflowers, some of which do not grow anywhere else in the world. It typically occurs between the end of August and November.Although thought of as rare, this phenomenon also occurred in 2024, following heavy rainfall in the area.This year's display will be at its peak for another few weeks, according to CONAF, Chile's National Forest Corporation.Click here to play 'Cooler than me?'",

In it, the first lady pleads with Putin to protect children, writing that doing so \"will do more than serve Russia alone\" and \"will serve humanity itself\".\"Eight children have been rejoined with their families during the past 24 hours,\" Mrs Trump said, flanked by American flags behind a podium in the White House.\"Each child has lived in turmoil because of the war in Ukraine.\"Of the eight children, the First Lady said three separated from their families were displaced to Russia because of front-line fighting.Another young girl displaced by the conflict has now been returned from Ukraine to Russia, Mrs Trump says.The children's reunification with their families was facilitated by both Ukraine and Russia, the First Lady said, adding that she was given a detailed report with photographs and the \"identities and circumstances\" of each child.The US government \"confirmed the facts\", she said.Mrs Trump said she has \"learned a lot about this matter\" since her letter was first handed to Putin. She said he responded in writing. In her letter, the First Lady wrote: \"Every child shares the same quiet dreams in their heart... They dream of love, possibility, and safety from danger.\" The announcement marks a positive development in her advocacy for children from the White House, which began during President Trump's first term. She launched the BE BEST initiative in January 2021, which the White House describes as an awareness campaign focused around the well-being of children globally.Earlier this year, the First Lady led an initiative for Congress to pass a bill banning revenge porn called the Take It Down Act. After the bill was signed, she said it was \"a powerful statement that we stand united in protecting the dignity, privacy, and safety of our children\".According to the Ukrainian government, at least 19,500 Ukrainian children have been deported and forcibly displaced from their homes to Russia and Russian-occupied territories since February 2022.Just 1,605 have come home so far, according to the government's Children of War database, external.The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Children's Rights Commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, in 2023 for the alleged unlawful deportation of children.Russia denies the accusation and says it has protected children by moving them from a war zone for their safety.",

Fellow CCC member and MP Discent Bajila provided more details on the horrific crash to local news site ZimLive.com. He told the publication he had spoken to the injured MPs, who relayed what had happened.\"I spoke to [Madalaboy] Ndebele, who was in the front passenger seat. His recollection is that they hit the elephant on its backside. After the impact, he remembers the elephant turning round and fighting the vehicle. \"This, he believes, is what did the most damage on the top right side of the vehicle and ultimately led to Moyo's fatal injuries,\" Bajila said.The accident took place in an area where elephants are known to roam to and from their home ranges in the north-west of Zimbabwe.Fellow lawmaker Caston Matewu was among those to pay tribute to Moyo, affectionately known as Moyoxide, hailing him as \"one of the hardest working MPs in Parliament\".\"The people of Nkulumani [sic] have been robbed of this great [man],\" Mr Matewu said.The City of Bulawayo, led by mayor David Coltart, said Mr Moyo would be remembered as an \"iconic leader ... and creative\" who \"strove to champion the arts\" in the city and beyond.Mr Moyo was an award-winning poet, educator and arts administrator \"who devoted his life to nurturing Zimbabwe's creative sector\", according to the state-run Herald news site.The other lawmakers involved in Friday's crash have been taken to hospital.",

Israel-Gaza war ceasefire live updatesThe taskforce will be led by US Central Command (Centcom) based in the region, and is intended to oversee the progress of the ceasefire agreement and also help coordinate humanitarian assistance.The multinational force will inform both the Israelis and Hamas via Egypt and Qatar of the situation on the ground and any potential violations of the truce, one of the officials said.The force is being established under the leadership of Adm Brad Cooper, head of Centcom. He joined the American delegation for part of indirect talks in Egypt earlier this week, one of the officials said. Those talks led to US President Donald Trump announcing on Thursday that Israel and Hamas had \"signed off on the first phase\" of a peace plan he unveiled last week. One of the point's in Trump's 20-point Gaza plan included the US working with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilisation Force to immediately deploy in Gaza but this is yet to be agreed between the sides and would only happen if a hostage and prisoner exchange is completed.Israel launched the war in Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.Since then, Israel's massive military offensive has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, including more than 18,000 children. These figures are seen as reliable by the UN and other international bodies.",

Locals there told the BBC's Afghan service that a number of shops had been destroyed.Pakistan has neither confirmed nor denied that they launched an attack inside Afghanistan.However, during a press conference held in the city of Peshawar on Friday, a top general alleged Afghanistan was being used as a \"base of operation for terrorism against Pakistan\". \"To safeguard Pakistani lives and properties, what measures need to be taken will be taken,\" General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry added.Pakistan has long accused the Afghan Taliban of permitting the Pakistan Taliban, also known as the TTP, to operate from their land. The Taliban government have always denied this.Rumours had circulated that the blasts in Kabul were part of a targeted attack on the TTP's leader, Noor Wali Mehsud.In response, the TTP released an unverified voice note from Mehsud saying he was still alive.Exactly what happened is unclear; BBC Afghan's correspondent saw no signs of an explosion in the suspected location of the blasts on Friday, but did report a heavy Taliban presence and mobile checkpoints.The Taliban Defence Ministry warned in its statement that, should the situation become worse, \"the consequences will be attributable to the Pakistani army\".However, the Taliban's foreign minister - who is currently in the Indian capital Delhi - said they wanted to maintain good relations with Pakistan.\"Pakistan should not repeat this mistake,\" Amir Khan Muttaqi told a select group of 16 male journalists from Indian media. \"Our issues can be solved by negotiation not by war.\"",

    "body": "12 minutes agoRushdi AbualoufGaza correspondent reporting from IstanbulHamas is pressing Israel to include prominent Palestinians in a prisoner-release list -  part of a ceasefire deal that will also see hostages returned from Gaza.Hamas's insistence comes after the Israeli justice ministry published the names of 250 prisoners to be freed, but excluded seven high-profile prisoners, including Marwan Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat.The men, who are serving sentences after being convicted of involvement in separate deadly attacks in Israel, have long been seen by Palestinians as symbols of resistance.Twenty Israeli hostages are expected to be released before 12:00 (09:00 GMT) on Monday as part of the deal proposed by US President Donald Trump.A senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks told the BBC that US envoy Steve Witkoff had promised to raise the exclusion of the Palestinian prisoners with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but Israel has firmly refused to include them.It is not clear whether this could be a sticking point, or impact the timeline for the release of hostages from the Gaza Strip and Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.Follow live updatesWho are the 48 hostages still held in Gaza?What we know about the Gaza ceasefire agreementPalestinians return to devastation in Gaza CityThe releases are due to take place in the first phase of Trump's ceasefire and hostage return deal, approved this week to end the two-year war in Gaza.It is unclear how the hostages will be released this time - on previous occasions Hamas paraded them in public, infuriating Israel and many of its Western allies. The bodies of deceased hostages will also be returned. It is thought that at least 26 hostages are deceased, with the fate of two others unknown.Israel will also release about 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences in Israeli jails, and another 1,700 Palestinians from Gaza who have been detained.Hamas had submitted a list of prisoners it wanted released that included Barghouti and Saadat.Barghouti is serving five life sentences plus 40 years after being convicted in 2004 of planning attacks that led to five civilians being killed. Opinion polls have consistently indicated that he remains the most popular Palestinian leader, and that Palestinians would vote for him in a presidential election ahead of the current Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas or Hamas leaders.Barghouti remains a senior figure in the Fatah faction that dominates the PA, which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under Israeli control.Saadat, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), was sentenced to 30 years after being convicted in 2008 of heading an \"illegal terrorist organisation\" and involvement in attacks, including the assassination of an Israeli minister in 2001.Among the 250 prisoners set to be released is Iyad Abu al-Rub, an Islamic Jihad commander convicted of orchestrating suicide bombings in Israel that killed 13 people in the early 2000s.According to the Israeli justice ministry, he will be released either to Gaza or deported abroad.The BBC understands that Hamas is also pushing for some possible additional prisoner releases. These relate to Palestinian prisoners who were released years ago as part of an exchange for the hostage Gilad Shalit - and then were rearrested after 7 October.Hamas argues that since they were part of a previous hostage exchange, they should not be included in the 250 figure.In Israel, hospitals are preparing for the release of hostages as families await their return.The first phase of the Israel-Hamas deal saw a ceasefire take effect on Friday and Israeli forces partially withdraw from parts of Gaza. Hundreds of aid trucks a day are now expected to enter. The next phases are still being negotiated.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have returned from southern Gaza to Gaza City, weeks after fleeing the Israeli offensive that destroyed much of the city.Gaza's Hamas-run civil defence agency has said it is conducting recovery operations and pulling bodies from the rubble, with Palestinians still missing across the territory.Israel's war on Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.Since then, 67,682 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military offensive in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says.Additional reporting by Mallory Moench",

    "body": "16 hours agoNatalie ShermanBusiness reporterWatch: 'It was shocking', Trump says of China's tightened export rules for rare earthsUS President Donald Trump has said he would impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China from next month. In a post on social media, Trump said the US would also put export controls on critical software. In an earlier post on Friday, he hit back at Beijing's move this week to tighten its rules for exports of rare earths, accusing China of \"becoming very hostile\" and trying to hold the world \"captive\".He threatened to pull out of a meeting with China's President Xi Jinping. He later said he had not cancelled it, but that he did not know \"that we're going to have it\". \"I'm going to be there regardless,\" he told reporters at the White House.Financial markets dropped in the wake of Trump's remarks, with the S&P 500 closing down 2.7%, its steepest fall since April.  China dominates production of rare earths and certain other key materials, which are key components in cars, smartphones and many other items.The last time Beijing tightened export controls - after Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods early this year - there was an outcry from many US firms reliant on the materials. Carmaker Ford even had to temporarily pause production.In addition to tightening rules for rare earth exports, China has opened a monopoly investigation into the US tech firm Qualcomm that could stall its acquisition of another chipmaker. Getty ImagesTrump visited China in his first termAlthough Qualcomm is based in the US, a significant portion of its business is concentrated in China.Beijing has also said it will charge new port fees to ships with ties to the US, including those owned or operated by US firms.\"Some very strange things are happening in China!\" Trump wrote in a post on social media on Friday. \"They are becoming very hostile.\"The US and China have been in a fragile trade dÃ©tente since May, when the two sides agreed to drop triple-digit tariffs on each others' goods that had nearly stopped trade between the two countries. The move left US tariffs on Chinese goods facing an added 30% levy compared with the start of the year, while US goods entering China face a new 10% tariff.Officials have held a series of talks since then on matters including TikTok, agricultural purchases, and the trade of rare earths and advanced technology like semiconductors.The two sides were expected to meet again this month at a summit in South Korea.China expert Jonathan Czin, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, said Xi's recent actions were a bid to shape the upcoming talks, noting that the recent rare earths directive does not go into effect immediately.\"He's looking for ways to seize the initiative,\" he said. \"The Trump administration is having to play a game of whack-a-mole and deal with these issues as they come up.\"He added that he did not think China was worried about US retaliation in response.\"What China took away from the Liberation Day tariffs and the cycle of escalation followed by de-escalation is that the Chinese side had a higher pain threshold,\" he said. \"From their perspective, the Trump administration blinked.\" In prior rounds of trade talks, China has pushed for looser US restrictions on semiconductors. It is also interested in securing more stable tariff policies that would make it easier for its businesses to sell into the US. Xi had previously used as leverage his country's dominance of rare earths production. But the export rules unveiled this week target overseas defence manufacturers, making them particularly serious, said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"Nothing makes America move like targeting our defence industry,\" she said. \"The US is going to have to negotiate because we have limited options, and in an era of rising geopolitical tension and potential conflict, we need to build our industrial defence base.\"While a Trump-Xi meeting now looks unlikely, she said it was not necessarily completely off the table. Ms Baskaran said there's still time and room for talks. China's new rules don't take effect until December. \"Negotiations are likely imminent,\" she said. \"Who does them and where they happen will be determined with time.\"",

    "body": "Aerial footage shows devastation after blast at explosives manufacturer in TennesseeEighteen people are missing after a blast at a military explosives manufacturing facility in Tennessee on Friday.Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis said one person initially believed to be on site had been located at home. Four or five people were taken to a nearby hospital after the enormous explosion that levelled the factory.\"There's nothing to describe, it's gone,\" he said.The plant in Bucksnort, Tennessee - roughly 56 miles (90km) south-west of Nashville -  specialises in the development, manufacture, handling and storage of explosives. The cause of the blast remains unclear.Aerial video from the scene showed charred debris, smouldering vehicles and little remaining of the facility, which is owned by Accurate Energetic Systems.Sheriff Davis, who was visibly emotional during his first media briefing of the day, declined to say exactly how many people died. But he noted that the plant had been up and running when the explosion happened and that secondary blasts forced first responders to keep their distance from the site.Workers who had just started their day \"now may be missing or deceased\".\"A lot of times, when I have these types of situations, I refer to them more than just a person...we're missing 19 souls,\" Davis said.During a second briefing hours later, Davis confirmed that 19 people were still unaccounted for and that the explosion happened in a large building. It flung debris across a half square mile, he added.\"This was a massive enough explosion that I can tell you that folks in Waverly felt and heard this explosion,\" he said, referring to a town about 15.5 miles (25km) north west of the facility.Davis declined to answer whether he believed the explosion was accidental or intentional, saying that \"we have to make the worst assumption in order to find the truth\".Tennessee Governor Bill Lee in a social media post said his office was monitoring the ongoing situation, and referred to it as a \"tragic incident\".  State and local authorities were working with federal agencies to respond to the explosion.Casey Stapp, director of media relations at TriStar Health in nearby Dickson, said two walk-in patients were treated for \"minor injuries\" from the explosion and have been released.A third walk-in patient, Stapp said, is still being treated for minor injuries.Local news media said patients were also being treated at other hospitals in the area and that residents who lived more than 20 miles away from the site could feel the explosion.The factory, which sat on about 1,300 acres of land, produced C-4, TNT and other high-grade military and commercial explosives and stored them there. Accurate Energetics Systems has now ceased operations, the sheriff said. It is believed that the company employed about 75 people.\"They are focusing on their families, their employees,\" Davis said.The explosion took place on the border of Hickman and Humphreys Counties and prompted a massive response from local and federal agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.The FBI and ATF secured the scene and declared it stable, Davis said. Officers are expected to remain on the scene for several days, with a number of teams trying to figure out what happened, Davis said, promising a \"slow and methodical\" investigation. Another blast took place at the same location in 2014 at a unit that was being operated by a company called Rio Ammunition.Reports from the time said one man was killed and three were injured in that blast.Mixing explosives and filling munitions is a \"high-hazard, low-probability industry\" when properly regulated, Ken Cross, former head of the Institute of Explosives Engineers, told the BBC. \"Competent staff are essential, and the majority of organisations provide relevant training and supervision for their explosives worker,\" he added.He also noted that, globally, there are reports of explosions in factories most weeks, but those are often in places that make fireworks or \"that might be considered to have less than ideal explosives safety legislation and official oversight in place\".",

    "body": "Burkina Faso's military government has refused to take in deportees from the US, as Washington suspended issuing visas in the West African nation.Foreign affairs minister Karamoko Jean-Marie TraorÃ© questioned if the embassy's decision was \"blackmail\" after he said he had rejected a US proposal to take in migrants from third countries. Donald Trump's administration has turned to African countries as a destination to deport migrants to as part of his crackdown on immigration.  The US State Department said it was committed to ending illegal and mass migration and bolstering US border security. The Department of Homeland Security have been contacted for comment.Burkina Faso's leader Capt Ibrahim TraorÃ© styles himself as a pan-African champion, standing up to Western imperialism. His military government seized power in a coup three years ago, and has had a frosty relationship with Western nations ever since.Destination: Africa - is it legal for US to deport foreign criminals to the continent?Deported from the US to Ghana then 'dumped' at the border: Nigerian man speaks outAppearing on state broadcaster RTB late on Thursday, the foreign minister asked: \"Is this a way to put pressure on us? Is this blackmail? Whatever it is... Burkina Faso is a place of dignity, a destination, not a place of expulsion.\" He said he had a meeting with the US Embassy on Wednesday in which he rejected the offer - that he said had been made repeatedly - to accept deportees.On Thursday, the US embassy in Burkina Faso's capital Ouagadougou announced on its website that it would temporarily pause issuing immigrant, tourist, student and business traveller visas. Instead, residents of Burkina Faso will have to travel to the US embassy in the capital of neighbouring Togo. Foreign Minister TraorÃ© said he had received a diplomatic note from the US explaining that Burkina Faso was put on a list of countries whose nationals had not respected rules around US visas and referring to the US proposals, according to a local news outlet's transcript of the interview. Several African countries - Eswatini, Ghana, Rwanda and South Sudan - have all accepted people from third countries expelled from the US in recent months. On Monday, Eswatini accepted 10 deportees despite legal challenges, adding to an earlier group of five, which the US had described as serious criminals. However, Nigeria has said it would not take any US deportees.Trump's crackdown aims to deport millions of immigrants in the US illegally. \"Naturally, this proposal, which we considered indecent at the time, runs completely contrary to the principle of dignity,\" TraorÃ© added.

    "body": "17 hours agoHarry Sekulich andJaroslav LukivOvernight Russian missile and drone strikes have caused power cuts in large parts of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, and eight other regions.Kyiv's authorities said power was later restored to more than 540,000 consumers in the city - but many households are still without electricity.Twelve people were injured in the city, said Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko. In the southern Zaporizhzhia region, a seven-year-old boy was killed and seven others injured. Ten people were also injured in the central Cherkasy region.Russia's defence ministry said its \"massive\" strike with high-precision weapons - including hypersonic missiles - targeted energy facilities used by Ukraine's \"military-industrial complex\".Russia - which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 - has escalated attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities as well as transport infrastructure as winter approaches.Reacting to the latest Russian strikes, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated calls for allies to act decisively to \"defend people from this terror\".\"What's needed is not empty words but decisive action - from the United States, Europe and the G7 - in delivering air defence systems and enforcing sanctions,\" he wrote.Zelensky said that more than 450 drones and over 30 missiles targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, describing such attacks as \"cynical and calculated\" and against \"everything that sustains normal life\" as temperatures become colder.More than 5,800 residential buildings in Kyiv were without electricity on Friday morning, local officials said. The city's eastern districts were the worst hit.Images of firefighters putting out blazes at a 10-storey building have been released by Ukraine's state emergency services.Residents in more than 7,000 buildings were left for hours without water - but the supplies were restored in the evening, the authorities said.Public transport - including the capital's widely used underground system - was also badly affected, with some stations forced to close after the Russian strikes.So-called \"invincibility\" tents - where people can get hot water and charge their gadgets - have been set up on the streets of Kyiv and other cities. Ukraine's Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk said Russia was \"inflicting a massive strike\" and repair crews were working to restore power.\"Exactly three years ago - to the day - on 10 October, our power system experienced one of the first massive attacks. Today, Russia continues to use cold and darkness as a tool of terror,\" she said.Ukrainian officials said they were forced to roll out emergency power outages in Kyiv and the capital region, as well as in the Sumy, Kharkiv, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kirovohrad and Zaporizhzhia regions.On Thursday, Zelensky told reporters that Russia was intentionally trying to demolish the country's energy grid, with attacks already disrupting gas facilities.He said energy workers and authorities were bracing for further attacks.Also on Friday, Zelensky told the BBC he would urge UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to join the PURL programme, under which Nato countries buy weapons from the US to give to Ukraine.While praising the UK's strong support for Kyiv - one of the largest in Europe - he said it should send a clear signal it will take part in the system, as well as imposing more sanctions on Russia.Downing Street later said Sir Keir and Zelensky had spoken, and agreed more sanctions on Russia \"in the coming days and weeks\" would put further \"pressure\" on Moscow.",

    "body": "16 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorAFPSÃ©bastien Lecornu spent just 26 days as prime minister before his dramatic resignation last MondayPresident Emmanuel Macron has asked SÃ©bastien Lecornu to return as French prime minister only four days after he stood down from the post, sparking a week of high drama and political turmoil.Macron made the announcement late on Friday, hours after meeting all the main parties together at the ÃlysÃ©e Palace, except the leaders of the far right and far left. Lecornu's return came as a surprise, as he said on national TV only two days ago he was not \"chasing the job\" and his \"mission is over\". It is not even certain he will be able to form a government, but he will have to hit the ground running. The new prime minister faces a deadline on Monday to put next year's budget before parliament.  The ÃlysÃ©e said the president had \"tasked [Lecornu] with forming a government\" and Macron's entourage indicated he had been given \"carte blanche\" to act.Lecornu, who is 39 and one of Macron's most loyal allies, then released a long statement on X in which he accepted \"out of duty the mission entrusted to me by the president, to do everything to provide France with a budget by the end of the year and respond to the everyday problems of our compatriots\".When he appeared on French TV this week, Lecornu described himself as a \"soldier-monk\", and as he prepared to get to grips with forming a government he said on Friday \"I will do everything to succeed in this mission\".AFP via Getty ImagesNational Rally leader Marine Le Pen (L) was not invited to Macron's talks and went to talk to voters at a livestock show insteadPolitical divisions over how to bring down France's national debt and cut the budget deficit have led to the fall of two of the past three prime ministers in the last year, so his challenge is immense. France's public debt earlier this year was almost 114% of economic output (GDP) - the third highest in the eurozone - and this year's budget deficit is projected to hit 5.4% of GDP.Among the conditions Lecornu listed for taking on the job, one was that \"no-one will be able to shirk\" the necessity of restoring France's public finances. With only 18 months before the end of Macron's presidency, he also warned that anyone joining his government would have to put on hold their presidential ambitions. What makes it even harder for Lecornu is that he will face a vote of confidence in a National Assembly where Macron has no majority to support him. The president's popularity hit a record low this week, according to an Elabe poll that put his approval rating on 14%.Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally, which was not invited to Macron's talks with party leaders on Friday, said that Lecornu's reappointment was a \"bad joke\", from a president \"more than ever isolated and disconnected at the ÃlysÃ©e\".Bardella said his party would immediately bring a vote of no confidence against a doomed coalition, whose only reason for being was fear of an election. National Rally is currently leading in the polls.Lecornu at least knows the pitfalls ahead as he tries to form a government, because he has already spent two days this week talking to parties that might take part.He was first appointed prime minister on 9 September and took the next three weeks to put together a government, only for it to fall apart overnight when the the leader of the conservative Republicans, Bruno Retailleau, criticised one of the ministerial appointments.By themselves the centrist parties cannot form a government, and there are splits within the conservative Republicans who have helped prop up Macron's governments since he lost his majority in elections last year. Retailleau, who is known to have presidential ambitions, has made clear he will not be part of Lecornu II, and has declared the socle commun (common platform) of centrists and conservatives as dead. Not all his party colleagues agree.But it means the centrist prime minister is also looking to left-wing parties for potential support.In an attempt to court the left, Macron's team indicated the president was considering a delay to part of his highly contentious pension reforms passed in 2023 which raised the retirement age from 62 to 64.AFP via Getty ImagesMarine Tondelier (L) of the Greens said she saw no reason not to bring a vote of no confidence in a Lecornu government That risks angering key centrist allies, who fought hard to get pension reforms through. It also falls short of the demands of left-wing leaders as they were hoping Macron would choose a prime minister from their side. Olivier Faure of the Socialists said \"since we've not been given any guarantees, we won't give any guarantee [to back the prime minister] in a vote of confidence\".Fabien Roussel from the Communists said after meeting the president that the left wanted real change, and a prime minister from the president's centrist camp would not be accepted by the French people.Greens leader Marine Tondelier said she was \"stunned\" Macron had offered the left almost nothing, adding that \"all of this is going to turn out very badly\". While Macron and his reappointed prime minister look to slash the government's budget deficit by tens of billions of euros, the head of France's central bank has warned that the political turmoil will set the economy back even further.The bank is forecasting growth this year of 0.7%, but its chief FranÃ§ois Villeroy de Galhau says it could have been higher and the uncertainty surrounding the crisis has cost France an estimated 0.2% of extra growth.\"Like many in France I've had enough of this [political] mess,\" he told RTL radio. \"It's time for compromises - that's not a dirty word - even forming coalitions.\"If Lecornu fails to form a government, there could be even more instability, and that will cost the French economy even more.",

    "body": "21 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent, Jerusalem andBBC Visual Journalism teamGetty ImagesA ceasefire has come into effect for the war in Gaza, after the Israeli government approved a US-brokered deal with Hamas in negotiations that had the personal involvement of US President Donald Trump.The full text of the agreement has not been made public - but part of it has been published by Israeli media.It appears to lack details and in some cases is vague and ambiguous - perhaps on purpose.Even its title, \"Implementation steps for President Trump's proposal for a comprehensive end of Gaza War\", leaves room for different interpretations.The full title suggests these are steps for the implementation of the 20-point plan that President Trump announced at the White House last week. The document was agreed after negotiations in Egypt over the first phase of the plan, related to a ceasefire, a hostage and prisoner exchange, and a surge in humanitarian aid.However, by highlighting \"Comprehensive end of Gaza war\", the document appears to be announcing the end of the two-year-old war.This paragraph explicitly says the war is over, which sets the scene for future discussions on later stages of the president's plan for Gaza. It appears to suggest that, even if the negotiations reach an impasse, hostilities will not resume.This is crucial as key sticking points remain, including the Israeli demand for Hamas to disarm, the scale of the Israeli withdrawal, and a plan for who will govern the territory. The document does not mention guarantees that could have been given that the conflict will not restart, or what could happen if either side returns to fighting.Speaking after the deal was reached, Hamas's exiled Gaza leader, Khalil Al-Hayya, said he had received assurances from the US and other mediators that the war had ended.Meanwhile, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not publicly said that the conflict is over. Following the approval of the deal by the Israeli government, Netanyahu released a video in which he appeared to threaten to use force if Israel's demands, including Hamas's disarmament, were not met. \"If this is achieved in the easy way, it's all for the better. And if not, it'll be achieved the hard way,\" he said.The document does not mention the next steps for the full implementation of Trump's plan.This appears to leave room for a return of Israeli troops to areas they had withdrawn from if Hamas is seen as not being fully compliant with the deal. It provides no details about what could constitute a violation.And the text does not explicitly rule out air strikes. Prior to the deal, Hamas officials were concerned that there would be a situation like the one in Lebanon, where a ceasefire deal has not prevented near-daily air strikes on people and targets Israel says are linked to Hezbollah, the Shia militia and political movement. The Lebanese government says Israel's actions are violations of the deal, which was also brokered with US help.Despite the demand that all hostages, alive and dead, should be freed within 72 hours of the partial Israeli withdrawal, the text concedes, although not explicitly, that Hamas is unlikely to be able to retrieve all bodies from deceased hostages within that timeframe, allowing the group to share the information it had gathered about those that could not be located.The text does not say what could happen in case of delays in freeing the 20 captives believed to be alive.This suggests the creation of a mechanism to monitor the deal and report any violations.US officials said separately that the US was moving up to 200 troops already based in the Middle East to co-ordinate the multination force. Assuming the hostage and prisoner exchange is completed, the officials said the intention was for a so-called International Stabilisation Force to be built, although this was yet to be agreed between the sides.Next phase of deal unclearThis deal is a significant diplomatic breakthrough led by Trump, who wants to be remembered as the one who brought the conflict to an end. The president employed American leverage to force Netanyahu, who has been accused of sabotaging earlier efforts for a deal, to engage with the negotiations. Hamas came under pressure from Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, and from a population in desperate need of help.Israel launched the war in response to the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023, when around 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians, and 251 were taken hostage.Israel's military campaign has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians and including more than 18,000 children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and led to a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.The first phase of the president's plan was, perhaps, the easiest one. Netanyahu was also facing growing domestic pressure, with polls consistently suggesting that the vast majority of Israelis wanted a deal with Hamas and the end of the war. Hamas, meanwhile, was apparently convinced that keeping the hostages had become a burden, giving Israel a reason to continue fighting.What happens next, however, is not clear. Progress will only happen if the Trump administration remains engaged, as both Israel and Hamas have reasons to stall the process. There is momentum, but major obstacles remain.",

    "body": "2 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorPoland has been told to recognise same-sex marriages registered elsewhere in the European Union, in a ruling by the EU's top court.The European Court of Justice (ECJ) said that EU member states were obliged to recognise a same-sex marriage between two EU citizens that had been \"lawfully concluded in another member state\".The ruling covers the case of a Polish couple who married in Berlin in 2018. When they decided to move to Poland, authorities refused to accept their marriage certificate as Polish law does not recognise same-sex marriage.The ECJ made clear that Polish domestic law would not have to be changed to recognise marriages between people of the same sex.Since the Netherlands recognised same-sex unions in 2001, a number of other EU countries have followed suit, but others, such as Poland, Hungary and Slovakia, have not.In September, Slovakia's populist-nationalist government changed its constitution to allow only heterosexual couples to adopt children.In its ruling on Tuesday, the ECJ said that while marriage rules fell within each member state's competence, \"countries were required to comply with EU law in exercising that competence\".As EU citizens, the Polish couple who married in Germany had the right to freedom of movement and the right to lead a family life, the court explained. \"In particular by virtue of marriage, they must have the certainty to be able to pursue that family life upon returning to their member state of origin,\" it added, so forcing them to live as an unmarried couple in Poland was contrary to EU law and infringed their rights.Poland's pro-European coalition government has tried to advance the rights of same-sex couples, but its move could be vetoed by conservative President Karol Nawrocki.The ECJ's ruling was welcomed by Katarzyna Kotula, a secretary of state and coalition ally of Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who said it was an important step on the path to marriage equality.Meanwhile, centre-left member of the European Parliament Krzysztof Smiszek wrote on social media that \"history is happening\".",

    "body": "A woman who was believed to be dead and about to be cremated at the Wat Rat Prakhong Tham Buddhist temple in the outskirts of Bangkok, Thailand, has been found alive by staff.The temple's general manager Pairat Soodthoop was \"startled\" to hear a faint knock from the coffin, he told the Associated Press news agency. Mr Soodthoop said he asked for the coffin to be opened and saw her \"opening her eyes slightly and knocking on the side of the coffin\". \"She must have been knocking for quite some time,\" he added. The brother of the 65-year-old woman said local officials told him his sister had died. However, the temple's manager said the brother did not have a death certificate.As Mr Soodthoop tried to explain to the brother how to obtain a death certificate, the temple's staff heard a faint knock coming from inside the coffin.Once it became clear the woman was alive, the temple's abbot (head of a Buddhist monastery) said the woman should be taken to hospital immediately. A doctor later confirmed that the woman had been experiencing severe hypoglycaemia - a condition where blood sugar levels get critically low, local reports said.The doctor ruled out the possibility that she had suffered respiratory failure or cardiac arrest, according to the reports.The younger brother said his sister had been bedridden for the last two years and as her health deteriorated she appeared to have stopped breathing on Saturday, according to the temple's manager.The family had travelled from the province of Phitsanulok in Thailand for the cremation ceremony, making a nearly 500km (311 mile) journey.",

    "body": "4 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterGetty ImagesA firm considered one of the leading global voices in encryption has cancelled the announcement of its leadership election results after an official lost the encrypted key needed to unlock them. The International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) uses an electronic voting system which needs three members, each with part of an encrypted key, to access the results. In a statement, the scientific organisation said one of the trustees had lost their key in \"an honest but unfortunate human mistake\", making it impossible for them to decrypt - and uncover - the final results.The IACR said it would rerun the election, adding \"new safeguards\" to stop similar mistakes happening again.The IACR is a global non-profit organisation which was founded in 1982 with the aim to \"further research\" in cryptology, the science of secure communication.It opened votes for three Director and four Officer positions on 17 October, with the process closing on 16 November.The Association used an open source electronic voting system called Helios for the process. The browser-based system uses cryptography to encrypt votes, or keep them secret.Three members of the association were chosen as independent trustees to each be given a third of the encrypted material, which when shared together would give the verdict.Whilst two of the trustees uploaded their share of the encrypted material online, a third never did.'Irretrievably' lostThe IACR said in a statement that the lack of results was due to one of the trustees \"irretrievably\" losing their private key, leaving it \"technically impossible\" for the firm to know the final verdict. It said it was therefore left with no choice but to cancel the election.The association added it was \"deeply sorry\" for the mistake, which it took \"very seriously\". American cryptographer Bruce Schneier told the BBC that failures in cryptographic systems often lie in the fact that \"to provide any actual security\" they have to be \"operated by humans\".\"Whether it's forgetting keys, improperly sharing keys, or making some other mistake,\" he said, \"cryptographic systems often fail for very human reasons\".Voting for the IACR positions has been renewed and will run until 20 December. The association said that it had replaced the initial trustee who lost the encrypted information and will now adopt a \"2-out-of-3\" threshold mechanism for the management of private keys, with a clear written procedure for trustees to follow.",

    "body": "Venezuela has told international airlines to resume flights to the country within 48 hours or risk being stripped of their clearance to fly there altogether.Several airlines suspended their flights to Venezuela after the US aviation regulator warned on Friday of \"heightened military activity\" in the area.The warning came as the US ramped up pressure on the Venezuelan government, sending the world's largest aircraft carrier to the southern Caribbean as part of a larger military build-up. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) has warned Venezuela's aviation authority that rescinding airlines' clearance would only isolate the country further. Venezuela's aviation authority (Inac), which reports to the country's ministry of transport, issued the ultimatum on Monday. Among the airlines affected are Spain's Iberia, Air Europa and Plus Ultra, Brazil's Gol, Chile's Latam, Colombia's Avianca, Portugal's TAP and Turkish Airlines. All of them - except Trinidad and Tobago's Caribbean Airlines, which had already stopped flights in September - halted their flights to Venezuela after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a \"Notice to Air Missions\" on Friday.In it, the FAA advised flight operators \"to exercise caution when operating in the Maiquetía flight information region at all altitudes due to the worsening security situation and heightened military activity in and around Venezuela\".Maiquetía is the location of Venezuela's main international airport, serving the capital, Caracas. While a number of airlines, including Panama's Copa and Venezuela's state-owned Conviasa, have continued to fly in and out of Maiquetía, the suspensions have severely curtailed the number of international flights.Aviation industry body Iata urged Inac to drop the deadline, to avoid further reducing \"connectivity to the country, which is already one of the least connected in the region\".Iata stressed in a statement that its member airlines had suspended their flights temporarily and remained \"committed to restoring operations to and from Venezuela as soon as conditions allow\".Tension between the US and Venezuela has been growing since the former escalated its military presence in the southern Caribbean, in an operation it says is designed to combat drug trafficking.The US Navy has carried out at least 21 strikes against boats allegedly carrying drugs - mostly in the Caribbean but also a few in the Pacific - since the beginning of September. The Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, has denounced the strikes and the military build-up, accusing the US of trying to overthrow him.On Monday, he struck a defiant note telling viewers of his TV show that \"they [the US] will not be able to defeat Venezuela, we are invincible\".The US government has labelled Maduro as an illegitimate leader, pointing to his 2024 re-election, which was widely dismissed as rigged.However, US President Donald Trump has not ruled out speaking directly to Maduro, telling reporters last week that \"at a certain period of time, I'll be talking to him\".",

    "body": "The controversial, US and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) says it is winding down its aid operations in the Palestinian territory, after almost six months.The organisation had already suspended its three food distribution sites in Gaza after the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel took effect six weeks ago.The GHF aimed to bypass the UN as the main supplier of aid to Gaza's population. UN and other aid agencies refused to co-operate with its system, saying it was unethical and unsafe.Hundreds of Palestinians were killed while seeking food amid chaotic scenes near GHF's sites, mostly by Israeli fire, according to the UN. Israel said its troops fired warning shots.The GHF said on Monday that it was winding down operations now because of the \"successful completion of its emergency mission\", with a total of three million packages containing the equivalent of more than 187 million meals delivered to Palestinians.The GHF's executive director, Jon Acree, also said the US-led Civil-Military Coordination Centre (CMCC) - which has been set up to help implement US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan - would be \"adopting and expanding the model GHF piloted\".US state department spokesperson Tommy Piggott wrote on X: \"GHF's model, in which Hamas could no longer loot and profit from stealing aid, played a huge role in getting Hamas to the table and achieving a ceasefire.\"Hamas - which denies stealing aid - welcomed the closure of the GHF, Reuters reported.A Hamas spokesman said GHF should be held accountable for the harm it caused to Palestinians.\"We call upon all international human rights organisations to ensure that it does not escape accountability after causing the death and injury of thousands of Gazans and covering up the starvation policy practised by the (Israeli) government,\" Hazem Qassem wrote on his Telegram channel.The GHF began operations in Gaza on 26 May, a week after Israel had partially eased a total blockade on aid and commercial deliveries to Gaza that lasted 11 weeks and caused severe shortages of essential supplies. Three months later, a famine was declared in Gaza City.The GHF's food distribution sites in southern and central Gaza were operated by US private security contractors and located inside Israeli military zones.The UN and its partners said the system contravened the fundamental humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence, and that channelling desperate people into militarised zones was inherently unsafe.The UN's human rights office said it recorded the killing of at least 859 Palestinians seeking food in the vicinity of GHF sites between 26 May and 31 July. Another 514 people were killed near the routes of UN and other aid convoys, it added. Most of them were killed by the Israeli military, according to the office.The Israeli military said its troops had fired warning shots at people who approached them in a \"threatening\" manner.The GHF said there were no shootings at the aid sites and accused the UN of using \"false and misleading\" statistics from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.The GHF's future had been uncertain since Hamas and Israel agreed a ceasefire deal to implement the first phase of Trump's peace plan.It said aid distribution would take place \"without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner\" with Hamas and Israel.UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Monday that the GHF's shutdown would have \"no impact\" on its operations \"because we never worked with them\".He also said that while more aid was getting into Gaza since the ceasefire took effect on 10 October, it was \"not enough to meet all the needs\" of the 2.1 million population.",

    "body": "10 hours agoJake KwonandLeehyun Choi,SeoulLee Soon-jae, one of South Korea's most beloved actors, died on Tuesday at the age of 91, his agency announced.In a career spanning more than 70 years across films, television and the stage, Lee was fondly known as the \"national TV dad\" for his many roles as a wise, older man. This included two of his best-known performances - as a strict father in the 1991 soap What on Earth is Love, and a silly but lovable grandpa in the popular sitcom High Kick! which aired from 2006 to 2012.News of his death has sparked an outpouring of tributes from young celebrities, including K-pop singers, speaking of his warmth and kindness, to President Lee Jae Myung.\"From theatre to film and television, he brought us laughter, emotion, comfort and courage,\" the president wrote on Facebook.Lee was acting until last year, when he won the grand prize at the KBS Drama Awards for his lead role in the comedy series, Dog Knows Everything. He was the oldest South Korean actor to ever win the honour. \"You become old when you sit down and expect to be waited on,\" he told fellow senior actors on the travel show Grandpas over Flowers. The 2013 show, which revolves around senior stars making strenuous journeys abroad, became a cultural phenomenon.Born in 1934 in Hoeryeong, a county now in North Korea, Lee was just four years old when his family moved south to Seoul.He was working in his grandparents' shop in the capital's Namdaemun market when Korea was liberated from Japanese rule in 1945.Lee studied philosophy at the prestigious Seoul National University but ventured into theatre and, eventually, TV and films. He said he was inspired to act after watching Sir Laurence Olivier play the title role in Hamlet.Lee appeared in some 140 TV shows through his career and continued to act on stage until October 2024, when he withdrew halfway through the run of the play Waiting for Godot because of an illness. He reappeared in public at the awards in December. He also had a brief foray into politics. In 1992, he was elected as a member of parliament for the conservative Democratic Liberal Party, but at the end of his four-year-term he did not run again. Lee's prolific career meant he has remained a household name for a decades, just as familiar to younger audiences and at a time when Korean entertainment is one of the country's biggest exports.His celebrity has even spilled onto the internet where scenes of him from High Kick! have resurfaced as memes on TikTok in recent years.Actor Yoo Yeon-seok, who studied under Lee, said he \"exemplified acting\"  and Lee Soon-jae's High Kick! co-star Jeong Bo-seok described Lee not just as a mentor in the industry, but a \"true mentor in my life\". He wrote on Instagram: \"Teacher, thank you so much for everything. I learned and felt so much from you - not only about acting, but also about life and the attitude of an actor.\" Additional reporting by Rachel Lee",

    "body": "15 hours agoBrandon DrenonGetty ImagesMarjorie Taylor Greene's five years in Congress will come to an early end on 5 January after she unexpectedly announced her resignation following a bitter rift with President Donald Trump.The surprise move from the Georgia congresswoman - a rising star in the Republican party - has left many speculating about her next steps.Her decision follows a public fallout with Trump, who branded her \"a traitor\" and said he would endorse her opponent in next year's election. It comes after months of Greene's blistering criticism on the Trump administration's refusal to release files related to the investigation into the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein - as well as several of Trump's policy positions.Rumours have already begun circulating that Greene, 51, might run for president in 2028, which she immediately shot down. So, if not the Oval Office, what is next for Greene? Run for president in 2028Although she claims she has no interest in the presidency now, having a future change of heart is not an unknown feature of US politics.When Greene signed a petition to force a vote requiring the release of the files related to Epstein - over Trump's objections - it went on to a bill authored by her Democratic colleague, Ro Khanna. Khanna told NBC News after Greene's latest announcement that she was \"likely to be a formidable 2028 candidate\", adding that she was \"more in touch\" with Trump's base than his number two, Vice-President JD Vance. Time Magazine also reported that Greene \"privately told allies\" she was considering a presidential bid, but Greene quickly dismissed the assertion as a \"complete lie\".\"I'm not running for President and never said I wanted to and have only laughed about it when anyone would mention it,\" Greene wrote on social media, re-posting Time Magazine's article. Greene has notably distanced herself from her party's positions - and from the president - for whom she once was an ardent supporter. She has spoken out against issues including Epstein files, Trump's global tariffs, support for Israel and healthcare funding. A possible run for governor or Senate Greene has not been quite as explicit about ruling out the possibility of running for Georgia governor or to represent her state in the US Senate.Elections for both take place in 2026.Two-time Republican Georgia Governor Brian Kemp is up against his term limit and unable to run again, widening the field of possible replacements. Greene could also use her clout to pursue the race for the US Senate and attempt to unseat Democrat Jon Ossoff, who is up for re-election next year.Both the role of governor and US senator are ones that Greene has expressed interest in, at least according to Trump.In the president's public spat with Greene following her resignation announcement, Trump wrote on social media that the feud began \"when I sent her a Poll stating that she should not run for Senator, or Governor\".\"She was at 12%, and didn't have a chance (unless, of course, she had my Endorsement — which she wasn't about to get!)\", he said.Kennesaw State University Professor of Political Science Kerwin Swint, who lives in Greene's congressional district, says that Trump is aware of her unpopularity outside of her immediate district, and that she would probably \"get obliterated\" if she ran for statewide office.Without those options, the only other office she may have her sights on is president, despite her protestations.\"I don't see that happening,\" Swint says. \"She would be such an amazing longshot to dark horse. \"But most politicians have a big enough ego that they look in the mirror, they see a future president. So it's not out of the question.\"Entering the conservative media landscape Swint predicts that she'll start a podcast and attempt to remain in the public spotlight by continuing to build her media profile.\"I think she wants to be an influencer basically. And so I think someone who wants to do that is going to reach for these media opportunities,\" he says.If she chooses a life outside of politics, Greene would join a host of former politicians and political operatives who have launched careers in the podcast arena. After Republican Representative Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress to accept his failed nomination to become Trump's US attorney general, he started his own podcast. The trend has even caught hold on the left, with Democrats like California Governor Gavin Newsom also hosting his own podcast. Meanwhile, FBI deputy director Dan Bongino went on to join the Trump administration after success as a radio host and commentator.Greene could also decide to become a conservative commentator on more left-leaning networks, like CNN, where she has made frequent appearances in recent days. \"I knew she was going to be the next co-host of The View!\", conservative personality Megan McCain wrote on X, referring to Greene's recent appearance on ABC's liberal-leaning daily chat show.Leave politics behind completelyIn the 10-minute video announcing her resignation, Greene also suggested she might leave politics to spend more time with her family who she said she missed \"precious time with\" as she fought for Trump. Throughout her time in politics, Greene said, she faced \"never ending personal attacks\" and \"threats\". \"It has been unfair and wrong, not only to me, but especially to my family,\" she said.  Since her public feud with the president, Greene said the threats against her have only increased.In addition to being a member of Congress, Greene is also the owner of a commercial construction and renovation company called Taylor Commercial. The company has managed roughly $250m in construction projects, since Greene acquired it in 2002, according to her website. With reporting by Max Matza",

A coroner's report was expected soon, his lawyer Chukwujiekwu Chukwudi said.Videos appearing to show the lifeless body of the actor began circulating online on Monday, causing upset.Mr Chukwudi told the BBC's Igbo service that an ambulance was called to Nwobu's hotel in the town of Benoni, near Johannesburg, after he was discovered in his room \"gasping for breath\".The actor was alone at the time, having returned from a night club where he had been with colleagues earlier in the evening, the lawyer said.Paramedics attempted to keep Nwobu alive using a defibrillator, but he died at the scene before they could take him to hospital, he added.Born in Nigeria's south-eastern state of Enugu in 1982, Odira Nwobu landed his first professional role - in a film called Joseph the Dreamer - straight out of secondary school.He had a prolific career but struggled with feeling typecast, he told BBC News Igbo back in 2021, which made him turn to content creation as a way to find more freedom. Across his TikTok, Instagram and YouTube accounts he amassed hundreds of thousands of followers.At the time of his death, Nwobu had been visiting South Africa with a group of social media influencers in order to promote a real estate company belonging to a Nigerian, said president of the Actors' Guild of Nigeria Emeka Rollas.Nwobu's lawyer had accompanied them as he is the legal adviser to the Nigerian firm that organised the trip.\"[We] were shocked to receive calls from Nigeria to confirm the passing away of the young man, while we were still debating how to break the news to his family,\" Mr Chukwudi said.In July, Nwobu survived a road accident which at the time led many people to wrongly speculate that he had died.The actor was not married and is not survived by any children, reports say.Additional reporting by Adline Okere",

    "body": "President Emmanuel Macron said he will announce a new military service aimed at boosting French army numbers later this week. Details are scant, but according to French media the scheme would be voluntary, remunerated and last 10 months.In an interview with local media he sought to reassure French people that the plan did not mean young people would be sent to fight in Ukraine.\"We really need to, right now, dispel any misconception that we're going to send our young people to Ukraine,\" he said. \"That's not at all what this is about.\"However, Macron stated the new framework was meant to address the \"desire for service\" among the youth - and to face the \"hybrid confrontation\" waged by Russia.\"If we French want to protect ourselves... we must show that we are not weak in the face of one power that threatens us the most.\"\"It is very important that as many of our fellow citizens as possible understand what our armed forces are and how they work,\" Macron added.No official details on the new military service have yet been shared, though it is expected Macron will elaborate on the proposal during a visit to an army base on Thursday.French media is reporting that the revamped voluntary military service could last 10 months. Volunteers will be paid between €900 (£790) and €1000 (£880) per month, according to La Tribune Dimanche.Conscription in France was scrapped in 1996. The current iteration of the national service, the Service national universel (SNU), only includes two weeks of training followed by another two weeks of community work. It was introduced in 2019 but never gained much traction.Raphaël Glucksmann of the centre-left Place Publique party said he was in favour of the proposal but suggested it should go further and be a universal and compulsory service - \"not necessarily military\" - which could create \"cohesion\". The National Rally (RN)'s Sébastien Chenu said he supported the idea, although he insisted it should start with a \"mandatory three-month military service for boys and girls\" which could then be extended further.Last week France's army chief-of-staff Gen Fabien Mandon sparked outrage when he told a congress of mayors that France's biggest weakness was the lack of a will to fight and warned the country risked \"losing its children\" in a potential war with Russia. Macron sounded the alarm over what he called a \"turning point in history\" earlier this year. In March, against the backdrop of the start of Donald Trump's second term in office and Russia's ongoing war on Ukraine, he gave a sombre address to the nation in which he said that France and Europe needed to be ready if the US was no longer by their side.\"We have to be united and determined to protect ourselves,\" Macron said at the time.Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, several European countries have brought back some form of military service. From next year Germany will mandate all 18-year-old men to fill out a questionnaire on their ability to serve, with the view of dramatically boosting troop numbers. Latvia and Sweden also recently restarted military service and Lithuania brought it back after Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014.",

    "body": "15 hours agoNardine Saadin Los Angeles Records about the death of Celeste Rivas Hernandez, a 15-year-old girl whose body was found in singer D4vd's car, have been barred from public release, officials said. The Los Angeles County medical examiner's office said it received a court order imposing a security hold on the case, and that no details about Ms Rivas Hernandez's death can be released or posted on its website.The police department said it requested the order to ensure officers \"receive information from the Medical Examiner before the public\".Chief Medical Examiner Dr Odey Ukpo said the practice of security holds is \"virtually unheard of in other counties\" and \"has not been proven to improve outcomes in the legal system\". \"We are dedicated to serving our community with full transparency; however, the law precludes us from doing so while the court order remains in this case,\" Dr Ukpo added.Police discovered Rivas Hernandez's remains inside the boot of the impounded Tesla on 8 September, after responding to reports of a foul odour at a Hollywood tow yard. Rivas Hernandez, from Lake Elsinore in California, had been missing and was last seen in April 2024, according to a missing person flyer cited by CBS, the BBC's US news partner.The car, registered to D4vd, had been towed from the Hollywood Hills neighbourhood five days after it had been abandoned. D4vd, 20, whose real name is David Anthony Burke, released his debut album in April and was on tour when the remains were discovered. He has not commented on the case, but his representatives previously said he was cooperating with police.A police spokesperson said the case was being investigated by its robbery-homicide division. No arrests have been made. The county's medical examiner previously said Ms Rivas Hernandez's body was \"severely decomposed\" when it was found in September and deferred making a ruling on how she died pending the death investigation.When her remains were found in a bag in D4vd's car on 8 September, the medical examiner said that she was wearing a tube top, size small black leggings and jewellery, including a yellow metal stud earring and a yellow metal chain bracelet.She also had a tattoo that read \"Shhh…\" on her index finger - a marking nearly identical to that on the pop singer's own index finger.The decomposition of her body indicated that she had already been \"deceased for several weeks\", investigators said.The girl, who lived about 75 miles away from where her body was discovered - had run away from her home repeatedly.Neighbours recognised the first-generation daughter of immigrant parents from El Salvador, as a girl who would visit the corner store almost daily to buy candy and soda, according to the Los Angeles Times.Her family, who described her as a beloved daughter, sister, cousin and friend, said they were \"heartbroken and devastated by this tragic loss\". They solicited money on a crowdfunding website to pay for her funeral, which took place in October.The case has also derailed the aspiring career of the viral hitmaker.His world tour was cancelled within days of the discovery, and Sony Music Publishing reportedly suspended promotion of his second album.Los Angeles police soon raided the posh Hollywood Hills mansion where the singer was living, just blocks from where his Tesla had been towed.US retailer Hollister and footwear giant Crocs dropped D4vd from marketing campaigns and Telepatía singer Kali Uchis announced she was taking down their collaboration, Crashing.",

    "body": "Music eases surgery and speeds recovery, Indian study finds16 hours agoSoutik BiswasIndia correspondentBBCA patient with headphones playing music during surgery in a hospital in DelhiUnder the harsh lights of an operating theatre in the Indian capital, Delhi, a woman lies motionless as surgeons prepare to remove her gallbladder.She is under general anaesthesia: unconscious, insensate and rendered completely still by a blend of drugs that induce deep sleep, block memory, blunt pain and temporarily paralyse her muscles.Yet, amid the hum of monitors and the steady rhythm of the surgical team, a gentle stream of flute music plays through the headphones placed over her ears.Even as the drugs silence much of her brain, its auditory pathway remains partly active. When she wakes up, she will regain consciousness more quickly and clearly because she required lower doses of anaesthetic drugs such as propofol and opioid painkillers than patients who heard no music.That, at least, is what a new peer-reviewed study from Delhi's Maulana Azad Medical College and Lok Nayak Hospital suggests. The research, published in the journal Music and Medicine, offers some of the strongest evidence yet that music played during general anaesthesia can modestly but meaningfully reduce drug requirements and improve recovery.The study focuses on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the standard keyhole operation to remove the gallbladder. The procedure is short - usually under an hour - and demands a particularly swift, \"clear-headed\" recovery.To understand why the researchers turned to music, it helps to decode the modern practice of anaesthesia.\"Our aim is early discharge after surgery,\" says Dr Farah Husain, senior specialist in anaesthesia and certified music therapist for the study. \"Patients need to wake up clear-headed, alert and oriented, and ideally pain-free. With better pain management, the stress response is curtailed.\" Achieving that requires a carefully balanced mix of five or six drugs that together keep the patient asleep, block pain, prevent memory of the surgery and relax the muscles.Getty ImagesPatients need to wake up clear-headed and ideally pain-free after surgeryIn procedures like laparoscopic gallbladder removal, anaesthesiologists now often supplement this drug regimen with regional \"blocks\" - ultrasound-guided injections that numb nerves in the abdominal wall. \"General anaesthesia plus blocks is the norm,\" says Dr Tanvi Goel, primary investigator and a former senior resident of Maulana Azad Medical College. \"We've been doing this for decades.\"But the body does not take to surgery easily. Even under anaesthesia, it reacts: heart rate rises, hormones surge, blood pressure spikes. Reducing and managing this cascade is one of the central goals of modern surgical care. Dr Husain explains that the stress response can slow recovery and worsen inflammation, highlighting why careful management is so important.The stress starts even before the first cut, with intubation - the insertion of a breathing tube into the windpipe.To do this, the anaesthesiologist uses a laryngoscope to lift the tongue and soft tissues at the base of the throat, obtain a clear view of the vocal cords, and guide the tube into the trachea. It's a routine step in general anaesthesia that keeps the airway open and allows precise control of the patient's breathing while they are unconscious.\"The laryngoscopy and intubation are considered the most stressful response during general anaesthesia,\" says Dr Sonia Wadhawan, director-professor of anaesthesia and intensive care at Maulana Azad Medical College and supervisor of the study.\"Although the patient is unconscious and will remember nothing, their body still reacts to the stress with changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones.\"To be sure, the drugs have evolved. The old ether masks have vanished. In their place are intravenous agents - most notably propofol, the hypnotic made infamous by Michael Jackson's death but prized in operating theatres for its rapid onset and clean recovery. \"Propofol acts within about 12 seconds,\" notes Dr Goel. \"We prefer it for short surgeries like laparoscopic cholecystectomy because it avoids the 'hangover' caused by inhalational gases.\"The team of researchers wanted to know whether music could reduce how much propofol and fentanyl (an opioid painkiller) patients required. Less drugs means faster awakening, steadier vital signs and reduced side effects.So they designed a study. A pilot involving eight patients led to a full 11-month trial of 56 adults, aged roughly 20 to 45, randomly assigned to two groups. All received the same five-drug regimen: a drug that prevents nausea and vomiting, a sedative, fentanyl, propofol and a muscle relaxant. Both groups wore noise-cancelling headphones - but only one heard music.\"We asked patients to select from two calming instrumental pieces - soft flute or piano,\" says Dr Husain. \"The unconscious mind still has areas that remain active. Even if the music isn't explicitly recalled, implicit awareness can lead to beneficial effects.\"A pilot involving eight patients led to a full trial of 56 adults randomly assigned to two groups The results were striking.Patients exposed to music required lower doses of propofol and fentanyl. They experienced smoother recoveries, lower cortisol or stress-hormone levels and a much better control of blood pressure during the surgery. \"Since the ability to hear remains intact under anaesthesia,\" the researchers write, \"music can still shape the brain's internal state.\"Clearly, music seemed to quieten the internal storm. \"The auditory pathway remains active even when you're unconscious,\" says Dr Wadhawan. \"You may not remember the music, but the brain registers it.\"The idea that the mind behind the anaesthetic veil is not entirely silent has long intrigued scientists. Rare cases of \"intraoperative awareness\" show patients recalling fragments of operating-room conversation. If the brain is capable of picking up and remembering stressful experiences during surgery - even when a patient is unconscious - then it might also be able to register positive or comforting experiences, like music, even without conscious memory.\"We're only beginning to explore how the unconscious mind responds to non-pharmacological interventions like music,\" says Dr Husain. \"It's a way of humanising the operating room.\"Music therapy is not new to medicine; it has long been used in psychiatry, stroke rehabilitation and palliative care. But its entry into the intensely technical, machine-governed world of anaesthesia marks a quiet shift.If such a simple intervention can reduce drug use and speed recovery - even modestly - it could reshape how hospitals think about surgical wellbeing.As the research team prepares its next study exploring music-aided sedation, building on earlier findings, one truth is already humming through the data: even when the body is still and the mind asleep, it appears a few gentle notes can help the healing begin.",

    "body": "21 hours agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent , Geneva Donald Trump wants a peace deal in Ukraine very badly.Kyiv wants peace even more, just not at any cost.That's why when the US began pushing it to agree to a deal by Thanksgiving on what looked close to surrender terms, Ukraine pushed back.It scrambled senior officials to talks in Geneva and all of Sunday we saw delegates from the US and Ukraine shuttling back and forth between the two main venues in black limousines with darkened windows.They were joined by national security advisers from Germany, France and the UK.The only time I glimpsed Andriy Yermak, heading the negotiating team from Kyiv, he looked stony-faced.No wonder: the starting proposal on the table was so skewed towards Russia's demands, the talks began with the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio having to deny it had been written by the Kremlin.But Donald Trump had been clear that Ukraine needed to sign up fast or face unspecified consequences. So Kyiv had to engage.On Sunday night, Marco Rubio declared there'd been \"tremendous progress\" in the talks with just a \"couple of things\" still outstanding. When pressed, he wouldn't be more specific, calling the situation \"delicate\".But a joint Ukraine-US statement says there's now a whole new deal in play, which it calls an \"updated and revised framework document\".We haven't seen that yet. The Financial Times newspaper quotes one of the delegates, though - Ukraine's deputy foreign minister Sergiy Kyslytsya - who talks of a new 19-point plan with \"very little left\" from the original draft.That new document likely incorporates at least some of the amendments proposed by the Europeans and published by Reuters news agency that point to something far more palatable for Kyiv.In that version, an automatic veto on future Ukrainian Nato membership is gone - as well as a cap on troop numbers for the country's armed forces.It says no Western troops would be deployed to Ukraine permanently, but that's not an all-out ban.On the sensitive question of territory – land Ukrainian soldiers have been fighting and dying to defend for 11 years – there would be no handover of the rest of the Donbas region to Russia for free, and Ukraine would aim to recover occupied areas through exclusively diplomatic means. That's something Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously accepted. The full amnesty for war crimes is deleted, too.But most critically, there's reference to security guarantees.Several officials, including the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, have talked about Ukraine getting Article 5-style protection, meaning the US would be bound to come to its defence if Russia ever invaded again.That's the key issue which Ukraine says it can't negotiate on.We don't know how many of these European ideas have made it into the new proposal, but Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz calls the deal \"significantly modified\" – in a positive sense.So how did we get from a pro-Russian deal to this in just a day? It's hard to be sure, with US hawks like President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff in the room.The initial Kremlin-friendly plan was rooted in Witkoff's own visit to Russian President Vladimir Putin this spring, when he returned quoting Russia's controversial narratives almost verbatim.Instead, this plan seems like something Ukraine might sign up to – eventually.Which must be why Trump has gone from berating officials in Kyiv, again, for supposedly showing him \"zero gratitude\", to proclaiming that \"something good\" may be coming.But how good? There is still no sign that Russia is ready to give up fighting unless it's forced to.\"Putin is much more self-confident militarily, right now,\" Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center believes.She points to a corruption scandal and political crisis in Kyiv, problems mobilising soldiers there, and military gains for Russian forces on the ground – all driving Putin's thinking.At best, some suggest Trump's demand for a deal has injected new momentum into efforts to find peace, which Ukrainians, under fire, desperately want.But it's hard to escape the sense that these days of frantic diplomacy have only brought us back to where we started\"Russia's position is, 'we have laid out our demands, so do you take them or not?' Stanovaya said. \"'If so, we will stop the war – if not, we'll just wait until you're ready.'\"",

    "body": "36 minutes agoMadina MaishanuBBC Africa, Nigeria's Niger stateNigeria's government is making \"no meaningful effort\" to rescue more than 250 children abducted from a Catholic boarding school in the central state of Niger last Friday, the main Catholic cleric in the region has told the BBC.But Bishop Bulus Dauwa Yohanna's accusation was disputed by the state's police chief, who accused the school of failing to co-operate with its search and rescue operations.It is unclear who abducted the children from St Mary's school in Papiri village, but criminal gangs have been involved in kidnappings for ransom across Nigeria.US President Donald Trump has threatened to intervene militarily in Nigeria if the government fails to stop \"the killing of Christians\".Nigeria is the most-populous state in Africa, with a large Christian and Muslim population. Its government says that people of all faiths and no faith are victims of insecurity in the country. Militant Islamist groups are also waging an insurgency in Nigeria, with the government confirming last week that a senior army general had been killed by jihadists in an ambush in north-eastern Borno state.US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth held talks with Nigeria's National Security Adviser Mallam Nuhu Ribadu  last week to discuss ways to make \"tangible progress on stopping violence against Christians in Nigeria and combatting West African jihadist terrorist groups\", the US department of war said in a statement.  Nigeria's presidential spokesman Bayo Onanuga said that Ribadu's delegation refuted allegations of state-sanctioned religious persecution in the West African state, and said that the security crisis was driven by criminality, extremism and land-related conflicts.Onanuga added that the two governments had agreed to set up a working group to focus on strengthening defence and security cooperation. The Niger state chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) says that 303 students and 12 members of staff were abducted from the school in Papiri village, but 50 children managed to escape and have been reunited with their families.Bishop Yohanna - who is the chairman of the Niger chapter of CAN and leads the Catholic church in the region - told the BBC that the only official action taken so far to rescue the students had been to compile their names. \"I'm not aware of any effort made by government beyond collecting the names of the students from us,\" he said.He disputed allegations made the governor of Niger state, Umar Bago, in local media that the church had defied an order to close its school after threats of attacks. \"We did not receive any order at any point,\" the bishop added.Responding to criticism about the presence of police in Papiri, Niger state police chief Adamu Abdullahi Elleman said enough had been deployed despite the fact that the BBC only saw three officers at the school.The BBC also drove about 60km (37 miles) from Yauri, a major link road to Papiri, but came across only one police checkpoint and none of the officers was armed. However, the police commissioner insisted that a tactical police team and members of other security agencies were stationed in the community.He said the police headquarters in Agwara town, not far from Papiri, had been made the operational base.\"So they moved from Agwara police station to the school. Probably when you got there, they must have moved back to the headquarters,\" the police commissioner told the BBC. He stressed that a search operation for the children was continuing, but said the school was yet to \"report\" to his command. Meanwhile Nigeria's police chief Kayode Egbetokun said that he had stepped up operations, including on the intelligence front, to ensure the children and members of staff were freed.  \"We are ready to give everything to ensure that the remaining pupils and their teachers still in captivity are rescued unhurt,\" he said, in a statement issued after talks with the state governor.The abduction at the school was the third to hit Nigeria in a week.Last Monday, more than 20 schoolgirls, who the BBC has been told are Muslim, were kidnapped from a boarding school in Kebbi state, which borders Niger.A church was also attacked further south in Kwara state, with two people killed and dozens of worshippers abducted.President Bola Tinubu cancelled his trip to the G20 summit, held in South Africa at the weekend, to deal with the crisis.He posted on social media on Sunday that all the 38 worshippers abducted in Kwara state had been rescued.\"Let me be clear: I will not relent. Every Nigerian, in every state, has the right to safety - and under my watch, we will secure this nation and protect our people,\" Tinubu said.The spate of abductions has forced the closure of many boarding schools across Nigeria, with parents rushing to collect their children.The authorities in Lagos - the most populous state in Nigeria - said they were beefing up security at schools, places of worship and other key buildings to prevent attacks.Additional reporting by Chris Ewokor and Abayomi Adisa",

    "body": "2 days agoJane ChambersBusiness reporter, Aguas Calientes, PeruAFP via Getty ImagesMachu Picchu attracts more than 1.6 million tourists per year, but getting there is not easyMachu Picchu, the remains of a 15th Century Inca city, is Peru's most popular tourist destination, and a Unesco world heritage site. Yet a continuing dispute over the buses that take visitors up to the mountain-top site recently saw some 1,400 stranded tourists needing to be evacuated.Cristian Alberto Caballero Chacón is head of operations for bus company Consettur, which for the past 30 years has transported some 4,500 people every day to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas Calientes.It is a 20-minute journey, and the only alternative is an arduous, steep, two-hour walk.He admits that in the past few months \"there have been some conflicts between people from different communities here\".This conflict revolves around Consettur losing its licence to a rival bus firm in this remote part of Peru, where, unless you want to hike over Andes mountains, the only access is by public transport.To get to Machu Picchu without walking, tourists must first take a train to Aguas Calientes, which takes from two to three and a half hours. And then transfer to a bus for the final leg.Wilson ChiloA fleet of buses ferry tourists to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas CalientesBack in September, local protestors angry that Consettur was being replaced following what they saw as an insufficiently open bidding process, blocked the railway line to Aguas Calientes with rocks.This resulted in Peruvian authorities having to clear the tracks and evacuate tourists on special train services.A number of local people, who didn't want to go on the record, say the protestors were unhappy that Consettur had a monopoly on the lucrative bus service, and that its position as sole provider was simply due to be transferred to new company San Antonio de Torontoy. A round-trip bus ticket costs $24 (£18) for a foreigner and $15 for a Peruvian.Although Consettur's licence ran out in September, it is continuing to run its buses. And due to legal challenges, San Antonio de Torontoy has yet to start.It's a complex situation, involving people from different local communities wanting a slice of the bus income, but Mr Caballero is adamant that Consettur is not a monopoly.\"The owners of the business have been running the company for the past 30 years, and they are people who come from around here,\" he says. \"This is not a monopoly. Consettur is made up of 12 different companies with various partners.\"These partners include the local district council, which owns 38% of Consettur.Meanwhile, San Antonio de Torontoy is based slightly further away in the wider Urubamba Province.AFP via Getty ImagesUnless you fancy a long hike, the only way to get to the town of Aguas Calientes is by trainAs the row and legal dispute over the buses rumbles on, Australian tourist Annalise Jaksic complains about the cost of the trains to Aguas Calientes. The cheapest round-trip ticket is $140, rising to $2,000 for luxury first class.Speaking in Aguas Calientes, she says: \"We thought it was one train [all the way to Machu Picchu]. And we thought if there was any more transport to get up there it would all be included, because you pay so much money for the train.\"Her friend and travelling companion Todd Carland adds that buying the entry tickets for the site \"was a nightmare for us\". He says it was difficult to arrange because they weren't doing it through an expensive guided tour. A standard adult price for Machu Picchu is $57.The mayor of Aguas Calientes, Elvis La Torre, is also unhappy about the entry tickets, because he says that most of the revenues do not stay locally.\"Only 10% of the ticket sales stay in the region. The rest of the money goes to the Ministry of Culture to look after other archaeological sites around Peru and pay for wages.\"He wants more money to go to his community and the surrounding region to help improve tourism and fund more projects to help the locals. The Ministry of Culture was asked for a comment.Wilson ChiloCristian Alberto Caballero Chacón says Consettur would welcome the competitionOutside on one of the side streets that are full of stalls offering tourism souvenirs, like fluffy alpacas and scarves, Dina Huillca is sitting on the pavement selling roses, tomatoes and mint. She travels from her village to get here, and says that \"more needs to be done for the local communities\".She adds: \"We don't have basic services like running water, or a hospital, and the schools need to be in better condition.\"Carlos González is president of the chamber of tourism for this region of Peru, the Department of Cusco. He wants to see more state oversight of public transport in Peru.\"We are pushing for an update in the law so that the vice ministry of tourism can take care of all the travel resources in our country,\" he says. \"If we don't have a unified approach to Peru as a destination we can't be competitive in the long term.\"He also wants to change tourists' experiences in Machu Picchu, with more entrances, and separate areas where different types of visitors can gather.\"[Such as] spiritual travellers going and having meditative rituals in one area,\" says Mr Gonzalez. \"And let's not forget the younger crowd who are more inclined to do their Tik Toks and their stories for Instagram. They also need a place for doing that and enjoying themselves in a young fashion.\"But he says that Peru's unstable national governments make change difficult. The country has had six different presidents in the past six years.\"I've been a leader of the tourism sector for five years now, and I have lost count of how many ministers, vice ministers and congress people I have spoken to.\"Back in Aguas Calientes, Mr Caballero says he'd be happy to see both Consettur and San Antonio de Toronto run buses to and from Machu Picchu.\"If they are given the final approval we don't have a problem with working with them. We won't stop them.\"Read more global business and tech stories",

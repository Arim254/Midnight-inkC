    "body": "The Academy Awards will begin streaming exclusively on YouTube in 2029, the latest big change in Hollywood. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences made the announcement on Wednesday, saying that it signed a multi-year deal that will give YouTube the exclusive global rights to the Oscars until 2033. The Oscars, which is planned for 15 March, has aired for a half a century on ABC. Starting in 2029, the show will be available live and for free on YouTube. It's another big shakeup in Hollywood, which is dealing with studio sales and mergers, along with steep production cuts.\"The Academy is an international organization, and this partnership will allow us to expand access to the work of the Academy to the largest worldwide audience possible - which will be beneficial for our Academy members and the film community,\" Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Lynette Howell Taylor said in a statement. Over decades, viewership of the awards show has declined, though there was a slight uptick in 2025, with a significant number of younger viewers tuning in from cell phones and computers. In a statement, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan called the Oscars \"one of our essential cultural institutions\" and said that partnering with the Academy would \"inspire a new generation of creativity and film lovers while staying true to the Oscars' storied legacy\". ABC, which has streamed the awards since 1976, said that it was looking forward \"to the next three telecasts\" it will still host.The move comes as Warner Bros Discovery on Wednesday recommended its shareholders reject a hostile takeover bid from Paramount Skydance for a rival bid from streaming giant Netflix. Both options were seen as unfavourable for an industry that has seen drastic cuts over the past several years. Like major studios, cable networks have faced issues as the public has opted for streaming services instead. YouTube winning rights to the Academy Awards further suggests that reliance on streaming sites will continue.",

    "body": "Dan Bongino has said he will leave his role as the FBI's deputy director in January.In a post on X, he thanked President Donald Trump, as well as the director of the FBI and the attorney general \"for the opportunity to serve with purpose\".It comes after Trump said earlier on Wednesday that the former podcast host \"did a great job\" in office, and \"wants to go back to his show\".Bongino, who was appointed to the role by Trump in February, was previously a New York City police officer and a US Secret Service agent assigned to protect Barack Obama. In recent years, he built a large following through his podcast and other media appearances. Bongino, a staunch Trump ally, was considered a surprise pick for the role –  which had previously been held by career agents – because he had no prior experience with the agency.The FBI Agents Association, which represents around 14,000 current and former agents, had opposed his appointment to the position.Announcing his decision in a social media post on Wednesday, he said: \"I will be leaving my position with the FBI in January. I want to thank President Trump, AG [Pam] Bondi, and Director [Kash] Patel for the opportunity to serve with purpose.\"Most importantly, I want to thank you, my fellow Americans, for the privilege to serve you. God bless America, and all those who defend Her.\"Before joining the agency, Bongino had echoed disinformation and conspiracy theories about Trump's false claim that he won the 2020 election, and about the 6 January 2021 pipe bomb investigation. Bongino had previously called the pipe bomb case an \"inside job\". After taking office he pushed to make the investigation, which Attorney General Bondi said had \"languished\", a priority for the FBI.Earlier this month, a man with no known ties to the government was arrested, nearly six years after the pipe bombs were discovered outside the national headquarters for the Republican and Democratic parties. FBI Director Patel, in a social media post on Wednesday praising Bongino's tenure, said he had \"served as the people's voice for transparency, and delivered major breakthroughs in long unsolved cases like the pipe bomb investigation\". \"He not only completed his mission - he far exceeded it,\" Patel wrote.Bongino also appeared to change his mind about the death of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein once he became a leader at the FBI.As a commentator, he had questioned whether Epstein took his own life in a New York prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial. Then, in May, Bongino said: \"I have seen the whole file. He killed himself\".In July, the US justice department and FBI released a memo that said Epstein did take his own life, and did not have a \"client list\".The memo frustrated many of Trump's supporters, who echoed the Epstein conspiracy theories and rejected the justice department's findings.According to the BBC's media partner CBS News, the memo led to a contentious meeting between him and Bondi.Bondi, who oversees the FBI, wrote in a brief post on X on Wednesday that \"Americans are safer\" because of Bongino's FBI service.",

    "body": "10 hours agoAlex Partridge,Politics reporter,Emer Moreau,Business reporterandDamian Grammaticas,Political correspondentThe prime minister has said Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich must \"pay up now\" to victims of the war in Ukraine or face court action.Mr Abramovich, the former owner of Chelsea Football Club, pledged in 2022 that the £2.5bn he made from the sale of the club would be used to benefit victims of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.But there has been a delay in releasing the funds, which are currently frozen in a British bank account, due to a standoff over how exactly they should be used.Sir Keir Starmer told the Commons on Wednesday: \"My message to Abramovich is clear: the clock is ticking.\" The government wants the money to be used for humanitarian aid, but Mr Abramovich insisted it should be used for \"all victims of the war\" – meaning that Russians could also benefit.The oligarch cannot access the money under UK sanctions but the proceeds from the Chelsea sale still legally belong to him.Updating MPs, Sir Keir said the UK had issued a licence \"to transfer £2.5bn from the sale of Chelsea Football Club that's been frozen since 2022.\"And, in a warning to Abramovich, he said: \"Honour the commitment that you made and pay up now, and if you don't we're prepared to go to court and ensure that every penny reaches those whose lives have been torn apart by Putin's illegal war.\"And Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC Mr Abramovich \"needs to honour that commitment, pay that money\".Asked if a legal battle could drag out the process for years, Ms Cooper said: \"I'm urging him not to try and pursue further court action.\"But she confirmed the government will take the matter to court if he does not act.Mr Abramovich's representatives declined to comment.The Treasury said that under the terms of the licence, the money must go to \"humanitarian causes\" in Ukraine and cannot benefit Mr Abramovich or any other sanctioned individual.The government first threatened to sue Mr Abramovich in June.Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"It is unacceptable that more than £2.5bn of money owed to the Ukrainian people can be allowed to remain frozen in a UK bank account.\"Mr Abramovich – a Russian billionaire who made his fortune in oil and gas – was granted a special licence to sell Chelsea following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, providing he could prove he would not benefit from the sale.He is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, something he has denied.It is understood that Mr Abramovich has 90 days to act before the UK considers taking legal action.On Thursday, EU leaders are set to review proposals to use proceeds from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine's huge budget and defence needs. Russia has fiercely opposed the proposals.",

    "body": "Researchers tracking wild polar bears in northern Canada have witnessed something exceedingly rare: a mother bear adopting a cub that was not biologically her own. The five-year-old mother bear and her 10- to 11-month-old cubs were observed and captured on camera during the annual polar bear migration along the Western Hudson Bay near Churchill, Manitoba, a town known for its polar bear population.\"It's unusual,\" Alyssa McCall, a scientist at Polar Bears International, said in a video. \"We don't really know why it happens... but we know it doesn't happen often at all.\"It's only the 13th known case of adoption out of the 4,600 bears studied for nearly five decades in the area. The mother bear was first captured as she emerged from her maternity den this spring. At the time, she had one cub, which scientists tagged for study.In the fall, she was seen again, but this time with two cubs - the original cub that had been tagged and another without a tag. Researchers aren't sure what happened to the new cub's biological mother, but they are trying to identify her with genetic samples. \"The bears need all the help they can get these days with climate change,\" Evan Richardson, a polar bear scientist with Environment and Climate Change Canada, said in a video statement. \"If females have the opportunity to pick up another cub and care for it and successfully wean it, it's a good thing for bears in Churchill.\"Polar bears in the wild only have a 50% chance of surviving into adulthood, but having a mother caring for them improves their odds. The cubs appear to be healthy, researchers said, and they will likely stay with their mother until they are about two-and-a-half years old. Next, the family is expected to head out to sea ice, where the cubs will learn from their mother how to hunt seals and survive on their own. \"It's just nice to know that the bears are looking out for each other,\" Richardson said.

    "body": "11 hours agoAmy WalkerGetty ImagesSpain experienced exceptionally warm weather and low rainfall this summerSpain is to set up a national network of climate shelters in public buildings to offer people refuge from intense heat before next summer, its prime minister has announced.The move was announced as Pedro Sanchez laid out a plan to address the impact of climate change during a conference in Madrid on Wednesday. \"Devastating droughts and heatwaves are no longer rare. Some summers, it's not separate waves we face, but one long heatwave stretching from June through August. This is now the new normal,\" he said.Spain experienced its hottest summer and three heatwaves in 2025. A 16-day heatwave in August saw temperatures exceed 45C (113F), according to the State Meteorological Agency (AEMET). As part of the national network of shelters, spaces to stay cool will be available to everyone, Sanchez said.Shelters will be funded by the government in areas \"that need them most, where the heat really hits people the hardest,\" he added.The rollout will be in addition to existing networks already set up by regional governments including in Catalonia, the Basque Country and Murcia.In Barcelona - the capital of the Catalonia region - about 400 climate shelters already exist in buildings including libraries, museums, sports facilities and shopping malls.The air conditioned spaces, usually with seating and free water, are meant to provide people with a refuge from the heat, particularly those with health problems, older people, babies, and those with limited resources.Getty ImagesBarcelona already has a network of climate shelters in public buildings with air conditioningSanchez also announced that the government would fund flood prevention plans in small towns, with €20m (£18m; $24m) also designated for fire prevention plans in small towns, as part of a state pact to address climate change.The set of proposals are yet to be brought before the Congress of Deputies, lower house of Spain's Parliament. Sanchez has asked other political groups to contribute to the pact, saying it is \"not an electoral weapon... it is a shield for Spain\".Heatwaves are becoming more common and intense due to human-caused climate change, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.More than 3,800 heat-related deaths were recorded in Spain amid searing temperatures this summer - 88% more than in 2024 -  according to estimates by the Ministry of Health. During 2025, Spain also experienced a devastating wildfire season, with over 400,000 hectares burned.",

    "body": "1 day agoTheo LeggettInternational Business CorrespondentThe European Commission has watered down its plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035.Current rules state that new vehicles sold from that date should be \"zero emission\", but carmakers, particularly in Germany, have lobbied heavily for concessions.Under the European Commission's new plan, 90% of new cars sold from 2035 would have to be zero-emission, rather than 100%.According to the European carmakers association, ACEA, market demand for electric cars is currently too low, and without a change to the rules, manufacturers would risk \"multi-billion euro\" penalties.The remaining 10% could be made up of conventional petrol or diesel cars, along with hybrids.Carmakers will be expected to use low-carbon steel made in the EU in the vehicles they produce.The Commission also expects an increase in the use of biofuels and so-called e-fuels, which are synthesised from captured carbon dioxide, to compensate for the extra emissions created by petrol and diesel vehicles. Opponents of the move have warned that it risks undermining the transition towards electric vehicles and leaving the EU exposed in the face of foreign competition.The green transport group T&E has warned that the UK should not follow the EU's lead by weakening its own plans to phase out the sale of conventional cars under the Zero Emission Vehicles Mandate.\"The UK must stand firm. Our ZEV mandate is already driving jobs, investment and innovation into the UK. As major exporters we cannot compete unless we innovate, and global markets are going electric fast,\" said T&E UK's director Anna Krajinska.Ahead of the announcement, Sigrid de Vries, director general at ACEA, said that \"flexibility\" for manufacturers was \"urgent\".\"2030 is around the corner, and market demand is too low to avoid the risk of multi-billion-euro penalties for manufacturers,\" she said.\"It will take time to build the charging points and introduce fiscal and purchase incentives to get the market on track. Policy makers must provide breathing space to manufacturers to sustain jobs, innovation and investments.\"Carmakers in the UK have previously called for better incentives to encourage drivers to buy electric ahead of the government's planned ban on sales of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030.Firms across the world have been changing their production lines and investing billions as governments try to persuade people to drive greener cars to meet environmental targets.Volvo said it had \"built a complete EV portfolio in less than 10 years\" and was prepared to go fully electric, using hybrids as a transition. It argued if it can move away from petrol and diesel vehicles, other companies should be able to as well.The carmaker said: \"Weakening long-term commitments for short-term gain risks undermining Europe's competitiveness for years to come. \"A consistent and ambitious policy framework, as well as investments in public infrastructure, is what will deliver real benefits for customers, for the climate, and for Europe's industrial strength.\"However, German carmaker Volkswagen welcomed the European Commission's draft proposal on new CO₂ targets, calling it \"economically sound overall\".It said: \"The fact that small electric vehicles are to receive special support in future is very positive. It is extremely important that the CO₂ targets for 2030 are made more flexible for passenger cars and adjusted for light commercial vehicles.\"Opening up the market to vehicles with combustion engines while compensating for emissions is pragmatic and in line with market conditions.\"Colin Walker, head of transport at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) think tank, said the UK having \"stable policy\" would give companies the confidence to invest in charging infrastructure and avoid \"jeopardising investments\".\"It was government policy that saw Sunderland chosen to build Nissan's original electric Leaf, and today the latest Nissan EV has started rolling off the production lines in the North East, securing jobs for years to come,\" he said.Octopus Electric Vehicles chief executive Fiona Howarth warned that if the UK reduced its goals because of changes in Brussels, it would send a \"damaging signal to investors, manufacturers and supply-chain partners\".Many of these groups have already invested heavily in the transition \"on the assumption the UK would stay the course,\" she said.",

    "body": "1 day agoNardine Saad,Los AngelesandRegan MorrisReutersA California doctor who sold ketamine to Friends star Matthew Perry has been sentenced to eight months of home detention and three years of supervised release, making him the second person to be sentenced in the actor's death.Dr Mark Chavez is among five people - including another doctor and a dealer known as the Ketamine Queen - who have pleaded guilty to drug-related charges stemming from sitcom star's 2023 death at his Los Angeles home.The San Diego-based physician admitted to obtaining ketamine from his clinic and a wholesale distributor through a fraudulent prescription and sold it to Dr Salvador Plasencia, who supplied the dissociative anaesthetic to Perry. Plasencia was sentenced earlier this month to 30 months in prison.The multiyear federal investigation into Perry's death examined how the Emmy-winning actor acquired ketamine through an underground drug network in Hollywood. Ketamine, a surgical anaesthetic, is used as a treatment for depression, anxiety and pain. Perry, who had battled drug addiction and depression, had been prescribed the drug as part of his treatment but soon started seeking more than what he was allotted.That ultimately led him to the drug ring that ensnared the two doctors, Perry's live-in assistant, a man named Erik Fleming and American-British dual-national Jasveen Sangha, the dealer known as the Ketamine Queen. The latter three are due to be sentenced in the coming months. A post-mortem examination of Perry found a high concentration of ketamine in his blood and determined that \"acute effects\" of the substance killed him.ReutersMark Chavez, a doctor accused of supplying ketamine to 'Friends' actor Matthew Perry before his death, arrives in federal court in Los Angeles, California, on 2 October 2024.Prosecutors said Perry's assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, worked with Chavez and Plasencia to provide the actor with more than $50,000 (£38,000) of ketamine in the weeks before his death.In his plea agreement, Chavez admitted that he obtained ketamine from both his former clinic and a wholesale distributor through a fraudulent prescription. He submitted a fraudulent prescription for 30 ketamine lozenges under a former patient's name -  without her knowledge or consent - to sell to Plasencia to give to Perry. He confessed to selling 22 vials of liquid ketamine and nine ketamine lozenges to Plasencia, according to his October 2024 plea agreement.The transaction was part of a broader scheme in which Chavez and Plasencia discussed exploiting Perry's addiction for financial gain by mocking him in their text exchanges.\"I wonder how much this moron will pay,\" Plasencia wrote to Chavez. Chavez faced up to 10 years in federal prison. As part of his October 2024 plea deal, he surrendered his medical licence and passport.",

    "body": "4 hours agoOsmond Chia,Jonathan JosephsandDanielle Kaye,Business reporters Getty ImagesThe Warner Bros. logo is displayed at Warner Bros. Studio on December 5, 2025 in Burbank, California.Warner Bros Discovery has told its shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance's $108.4bn (£80.75bn) takeover bid.Paramount had said its offer was \"superior\" to a $72bn deal that Warner Bros struck with Netflix for its film and streaming businesses.But in a dramatic plot twist in the story of who will take control of one of Hollywood's oldest and most famous movie studios, Warner Brother's board \"unanimously\" recommended rejecting the offer and agreed the deal with Netflix was in the firm's best interests.The media giant put itself up for sale in October after receiving \"multiple\" expressions of interest from potential buyers, including approaches from Paramount Skydance.On 5 December, Warner Bros Discovery said it had agreed to sell its film and streaming businesses to Netflix.In a lengthy legal filing, Warner Bros Discovery's board said the offer from Paramount poses numerous and significant risks, and strongly rejects the idea that the Ellison family - one of America's richest - is financially supporting the bid.Paramount is backed by the billionaire Ellison family, which has close ties to the president.In a reflection of where power now lies in the entertainment industry, the Warner Bros board says the offer from streaming giant Netflix is well financed and offers better long term value to shareholders.Netflix welcomed the recommendation from Warner Bros. Ted Sarandos, Netflix's co-chief executive, called the company's merger agreement \"superior\" and \"in the best interest of stockholders\".In a letter to Warner Bros shareholders, Netflix reiterated its stance that its bid for Warner Bros involves a clearer funding structure and less regulatory risk.Paramount could still come back with another offer, meaning the take-over saga gripping Hollywood isn't over yet.The are considerable differences between the Netflix and Paramount offers.Netflix wants to buy Warner Bros. movie studio and its HBO streaming service, which would also give it access to Warner Bros' rich library of content and secure access to those movies and shows for its subscribers.But it doesn't want the media giant's pay-TV channels. If Warner Bros. goes with the Netflix deal it would leave Warner Bros to sell off its television networks, such as CNN and TNT, into a separate company before the takeover is completed.Paramount, on the other hand, wants to buy Warner Bros in its entirety, which would mean acquiring competitors to its own TV channels such as CBS, MTV and Showtime.Regulators might raise questions about an erosion of consumer choice, as the entertainment industry continues to consolidate ownership.The week after Netflix announced its deal to acquire Warner Bros, Paramount Skydance launched a new offer for the whole company, including its television networks.A takeover of Warner Bros is expected to face scrutiny from competition regulators in the US and Europe.A new owner of Warner Bros would gain a significant edge in the highly competitive streaming market. It would get a huge library of films and TV shows, including Harry Potter, the MonsterVerse, Friends and the HBO Max streaming service.Mike Proulx from research firm Forrester said the battle for control of Warner Bros will take months more to be resolved.\"What's unfolding now feels like a real-life, far more consequential episode of HBO's Succession,\" he said. \"And if you think you know how this plot ends, think again.\"Some in the film industry have criticised the plan to merge all or part of Warner Bros with a rival. The Writers Guild of America's East and West branches called for the merger to be blocked, arguing that it would result in lower wages and job cuts.The volume of content for viewers would also be reduced, it said.",

    "body": "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says his government will crack down on hate speech following Sunday's deadly shooting at Bondi Beach that targeted a Jewish festival.Fifteen people were killed when two gunmen opened fire at an event to mark the first day of Hanukkah.New laws will target \"those who spread hate, division and radicalisation\", Albanese told reporters in Canberra. The home affairs minister will also be given new powers to cancel or refuse visas for those who spread hate and a new taskforce will be set up to ensure the education system \"prevents, tackles and properly responds to antisemitism\".The new laws will also include penalties for preachers and leaders who promote violence, a new federal offence of \"aggravated hate speech\", and the introduction of \"hate\" as an aggravating factor in sentencing crimes for online threats and harassment.\"Every Jewish Australian has the right to feel safe, valued and respected for the contribution that they make to our great nation,\" Albanese said.\"The terrorists, inspired by ISIS... sought to turn Australians against each other. Australians have responded to that act of hatred with love and sympathy for those in mourning.\"Albanese added that his government would be \"fully supporting and adopting\" the  recommendations put forward in July in a report by antisemitism envoy Jillian Segal, who also spoke at the press conference. She said the country was \"at a very important moment not only for our community, but for fighting antisemitism around the world.\" Her report was criticised by some upon its release in July due to its implications for free speech, including plans to monitor universities and arts organisations and withhold funding if they were deemed to have failed to act against antisemitism. There were concerns for instance, that the funding could be used to silence pro-Palestinian protests.Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the government was \"shifting the threshold\".\"There have been individuals who have managed to exploit a nation that had different principles of freedom of speech and have gone right to the limits of language that is clearly dehumanising, unacceptable, having no place in Australia, but have not quite crossed the threshold to violence,\" he said.Meanwhile, Albanese acknowledged accusations from the Jewish community that his government had not done enough to prevent antisemitism since the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas, and said more could have been done. \"I accept my responsibility for the part in that as prime minister of Australia,\" he said. \"But what I also do is accept my responsibility to lead the nation and unite the nation. Because what people are looking for at this time isn't more division.\"",

    "body": "Finland's delegate to last month's Miss Universe pageant held in Thailand has sparked controversy and outrage after a photo of her pulling the corners of her eyes went viral.Sarah Dzafce, who has been stripped of her Miss Finland crown, uploaded the photo with the caption \"eating with a Chinese\". The slanted-eyes pose is often seen as disrespectful to East Asians.The post drew backlash in Japan, South Korea and China against the 22-year-old and even against her country's flag carrier, Finnair.Finland's prime minister weighed in on Monday, saying that making such gestures was \"thoughtless and stupid\" and that the controversy that ensued was \"damaging\" to the country.Ms Dzafce claimed the gesture was her reaction to a headache during dinner. She said a friend added the offensive caption to the 11 December post without her consent, according to local tabloid Ilta-Sanomat.Ms Dzafce has apologised for the photo, noting it has \"caused ill will in many people\".\"That was not my intention in any way... One of the most important things for me is respect for people, their backgrounds and differences,\" she wrote on an Instagram post.  The apology still drew criticism, with some calling it \"insincere\" given it was written in Finnish.One person wrote: \"That was uncalled for, Asian people didn't do anything to you... We [are] still disappointed in you.\"Two right-wing MPs in Finland, Juho Eerola and Kaisa Garedew, posted photos of themselves mimicking Ms Dzafce's gesture to show their support for the beauty queen.The posts were taken down after backlash. Eerola apologised adding he felt Ms Dzafce was given \"disproportionately harsh punishment\".Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo condemned the MPs' actions as \"childish\", adding that lawmakers should set an example of proper conduct.The Finns Party is deliberating whether the MPs should face any sanctions for their actions, local media reported.Finnair told public broadcaster Yle that the controversy had affected the company, and that there had been calls for tourists to boycott Finland.\"The statements or posts mentioned by some Finnish members of parliament do not represent the values of Finnair,\" the airline wrote on its Japanese X account on Tuesday.\"As an airline supported by employees from diverse backgrounds and customers around the world, we promise to welcome everyone with respect,\" it wrote.The debacle has also drawn attention in Japan, South Korea and China, among other East Asian countries.A Japanese man living in Finland launched a petition calling for an investigation into anti-Asian discrimination, which had gathered more than 7,000 signatures as of Sunday evening, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported.The Finnish embassy in Japan said it had received \"numerous opinions and questions\" on Finland's efforts to address racism. \"Racism remains a challenge in Finnish society, and its resolution requires continuous and resolute efforts,\" it acknowledged in an X post earlier this week.The controversy around Ms Dzafce is a postscript to a chaotic Miss Universe pageant hosted in Thailand that had been beset by walkouts and allegations of rigging.The Miss Finland Organisation said dethroning Ms Dzafce was a \"difficult but necessary\" move.\"Miss Finland holds a position of role-model status, which requires respecting all people regardless of their origin, background, or appearance,\" the organisation said in a statement.\"We are deeply sorry for the harm these events have caused. Especially to the Asian community, but also to everyone affected. Racism is never acceptable in any form,\" it wrote.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump has expanded a US travel ban, barring nationals of five additional countries and people travelling on Palestinian Authority-issued documents from entering the US.The White House said the restrictions were intended \"to protect the security of the United States\" and will come into force on 1 January.Full-entry restrictions will be imposed on people from Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan and Syria as well as Palestinian Authority passport holders.The administration also moved Laos and Sierra Leone, which were previously subject to partial restrictions, to the full ban list and put partial restrictions on 15 other countries, including Nigeria, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.Trump, who has tightened immigration controls since returning to the White House in January, said the expanded travel ban was necessary because of what his administration described as failures in screening and vetting systems overseas. Officials cited high visa overstay rates, unreliable civil records, corruption, terrorist activity and a lack of cooperation in accepting deported nationals.The announcement followed the arrest of an Afghan national suspected of shooting two National Guard troops over the Thanksgiving weekend, an incident the White House pointed to in highlighting its security concerns.This is the third time Trump has imposed a travel ban. During his first term, he introduced a similar order in 2017, which sparked protests and legal challenges at home and abroad. The policy was later upheld by the US Supreme Court.The White House said the restrictions would remain in place until affected countries show \"credible improvements\" in identity management, information-sharing and cooperation with US immigration authorities.A number of exceptions apply and the ban will not affect lawful permanent residents, many existing visa holders, diplomats, or athletes travelling for major sporting events. Officials said case-by-case waivers would also be available where travel is deemed to be in the national interest.Countries with full restrictions:AfghanistanBurkina FasoBurmaChadEquatorial GuineaEritreaHaitiIranLaosLibyaMaliNigerRepublic of the CongoSierra LeoneSomaliaSouth SudanSudanSyriaYemenIndividuals travelling on Palestinian Authority issued or endorsed travel documents are also subject to a full suspension of entryPartial restrictions:AngolaAntigua and BarbudaBeninBurundiCôte d'IvoireCubaDominicaGabonThe GambiaMalawiMauritaniaNigeriaSenegalTanzaniaTogoTongaVenezuelaZambiaZimbabweSpecial case: Turkmenistan (restrictions remain for immigrants but have been lifted for non-immigrant visas)",

    "body": "Naveed Akram, the surviving suspect in Sunday's mass shooting at Bondi Beach in Sydney, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act, the New South Wales police say.Akram, 24, was critically injured during the incident. His father Sajid Akram, 50, was killed in an exchange of fire with police at the scene.Fifteen people were killed and dozens of others were injured in the attack, which targeted Australia's Jewish community at an event celebrating the first night of Hanukkah. It was the country's deadliest shooting since 1996.Among the charges against Akram are 40 counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to murder, as well as one charge of causing a public display of a prohibited terrorist organisation symbol.Akram had his first hearing from his hospital bedside, the local New South Wales court said. The case has been adjourned until April 2026, the court added. Earlier on Wednesday, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said they were waiting for medication to wear off before formally questioning Akram.\"For his fairness, we need him to understand what is exactly happening,\" Lanyon said.As of Wednesday evening local time, 17 people are still being treated in hospitals across Sydney. One is in critical condition, with four others described as critical but stable.Police have designated the attack a terrorist incident, with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese saying it appears to have been \"motivated by Islamic State\" group ideology.On Tuesday, it emerged that the father and son had travelled to the Philippines in November.The Philippine immigration bureau told the BBC that they were in the country from 1 November to 28 November. Their final destination was the southern city of Davao, an immigration spokesperson said.Naveed Akram travelled to the Philippines using an Australian passport, while his father Sajid used an Indian passport, border authorities in Manila told the BBC.Sajid Akram was originally from the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, but had \"limited contact\" with his family there, a police official from the Indian state of Telangana said.Among those killed in the attack were two rabbis, a Holocaust survivor and a 10-year-old girl, named by her family as Matilda.Boris and Sofia Gurman, a couple filmed wrestling with one of the gunmen during the early stages of the attack, were also among the victims.Another 27 people were taken to hospital with injuries, including two police officers. One of the officers, named as 22-year-old Jack Hibbert, has lost vision in one eye and faces a \"long and challenging recovery\", his family said in a statement.Earlier in the day, thousands gathered to mourn British-born Rabbi Eli Schlanger, at the first funeral to be held for victims of the shooting.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was not present. Asked on ABC NewsRadio about his absence, he said: \"I would attend anything that I'm invited to. These are funerals that are taking place to farewell people's loved ones.\"The Jewish community has criticised Albanese for not taking enough action on antisemitism - he defended himself against those accusations, telling ABC NewsRadio he had taken a series of measures including appointing the country's first antisemitism envoy, toughening hate speech laws and increasing funding for social cohesion projects and Jewish institutions.Speaking at Rabbi Schlanger's funeral, Rabbi Levi Wolff described his death as an \"unspeakable loss\" for the community.\"Eli was ripped away from us, doing what he loved best,\" he said.\"Spreading love and joy and caring for his people with endless self-sacrifice in his life and in his death, he towered above as one of the highest and holiest souls.\"Rabbi Schlanger had helped organise Sunday's Hanukkah event.Funerals for the other victims are expected to happen over the coming days, including for the youngest victim, Matilda, on Thursday.",

    "body": "22 minutes agoAoife WalshandJames FitzGeraldUS President Donald Trump has ordered \"a total and complete\" blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela - a move denounced by Caracas as \"warmongering threats\".Trump wrote that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's government had been designated a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO), which had also engaged in \"Drug Smuggling, and Human Trafficking\".His remarks come after the US seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela last week, a significant action in light of the South American nation's reliance on oil.The US has also recently conducted deadly strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug-smuggling boats, and has significantly built up its naval presence nearby.Trump's post did not give further detail of how the wide-ranging blockade on sanctioned oil tankers would be enforced.As of last week, more than 30 of the 80 ships in Venezuelan waters or approaching the country were under US sanctions, according to data compiled by TankerTrackers.com.Multiple new US sanctions on ships said to be carrying Venezuelan oil were issued after the tanker was seized. Sanctions were also placed on some of President Maduro's relatives and on businesses associated with what the US called his illegitimate regime.In his Truth Social post on Tuesday, Trump wrote that Venezuela was \"completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America\". He added that it would \"only get bigger\" and \"be like nothing they have ever seen before\".Trump also accused Maduro's government of using \"stolen\" oil to \"finance themselves, Drug Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Murder, and Kidnapping\". Tuesday's post from Trump suggested that a label the US had previously applied only to Maduro was now being widened to his whole government.Last month, the US formally alleged that the Venezuelan Cartel de los Soles group was an FTO. The designation meant that Maduro was effectively designated as terrorist as well, because he was alleged to be group's leader - which he denies.In response to the recent US actions, Venezuela - home to the world's largest proven oil reserves - has accused Washington of seeking to steal its resources.Trump has repeatedly accused Venezuela of drug smuggling, and since September the US military has killed about 100 people with its strikes on boats that were allegedly carrying fentanyl and other illegal drugs to the US. However, it has provided no public evidence that these vessels were carrying drugs, be it fentanyl - which is mainly produced in Mexico - or cocaine.Another ship accused of drug trafficking was destroyed by the US military on Wednesday. US officials say four men were killed in the strike, which took place in the eastern Pacific Ocean.Venezuela's economy is heavily dependent on oil exports, even though the amount of oil it actually produces is relatively small given that the country is home to the world's largest proven reserves.When announcing the tanker seizure off Venezuela's coast last week, the White House said the vessel in question, called the Skipper, had been involved in \"illicit oil shipping\" and would be taken to a US port. Venezuela's government decried the move, with Maduro saying the US \"kidnapped the crew\" and \"stole\" the ship.The US had been building up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea, which borders Venezuela to the north, in the weeks and months before the raid.The build-up has involved thousands of troops and the USS Gerald Ford – the world's largest aircraft carrier – being positioned within striking distance of Venezuela.Congressman Joaquin Castro, a Democrat representing Texas, said Trump's \"naval blockade is unquestionably an act of war\".He added that US lawmakers would on Thursday vote on a resolution \"directing the president to end hostilities with Venezuela\". The US, under both Trump and former President Joe Biden, has opposed the Maduro government for years and pressed for him to be removed by imposing stringent sanctions.Maduro's government has been accused of rights abuses by the wider international community for many years. Venezuela's opposition, as well as many nations including the US, denounced last year's election as rigged and say his rule is therefore illegitimate.On Tuesday, the UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, warned that the country's \"crackdown on civic space has intensified, suffocating people's freedoms\".",

Maybe she [will] send some good vibes to the world.\"Jewish community leaders have in recent days suggested the tragedy was an inevitable result of Australia struggling to address rising antisemitism.The attack on Sunday was the country's deadliest incident since 1996, when a gunman killed 35 people during the Port Arthur massacre.Mourners - including the Governor General Sam Mostyn and New South Wales Premier Chris Minns - packed out the service in Sydney, wearing bee broaches and stickers as a tribute to the girl who adored them.Michael and Valentyna had named their daughter after the song Waltzing Matilda, as a tribute to the country where their Ukrainian family found safety.\"She's waltzing with the angels,\" Minns said, reading a poem in her honour.Rabbi Yehoram Ulman, who led the service, had to pause and collect himself as he paid tribute to Matilda's short life. \"The tragic, so totally cruel, unfathomable murder of young Matilda is something to all of us as if our own daughter was taken from us,\" he said.The service heard how she had lived with beauty, goodness and righteousness.\"The Jewish ... believe that death is not eternal … it is not because we are naïve,\" Rabbi Ulman said.\"I'm telling you with absolute conviction that the separation with Matilda is not forever.\"Still, he conceded that his words would likely offer little comfort - something he knows too well. A day earlier, Rabbi Ulman spoke at the funeral of his own son-in-law, Rabbi Eli Schlanger, who was also killed in the attack on Bondi.\"You give me strength at a time when you need strength yourselves. And I try to do the same,\" he said to Matilda's parents, who sobbed in the front row.Ms Chernykh earlier said the family was devastated.\"I look at their faces [and] I don't know if they will be ever happy again,\" she said of Matilda's parents.Matilda's younger sister, from whom she was \"inseparable\", is shattered and confused, she said. \"She doesn't have enough tears to cry.\"On the same day the massacre's youngest victim was laid to rest, its eldest was too. A service for Alex Kleytman - an 87-year-old Holocaust survivor - was held at the same funeral home on Thursday morning.In a statement, his family said he died doing what he loved most: protecting his wife Larisa and celebrating his Jewish faith. \"The two gunmen killed him, but his memories, his legacy, and his books will bring light for generations to come,\" it read.Police have designated the attack a terrorist incident, with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese saying it appears to have been \"motivated by Islamic State\" group ideology.Police allege that the two gunmen were a father and son. Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead at the scene, while his son Naveed, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act.Australia on Thursday announced it would strengthen laws to crack down on hate - including by introducing powers to cancel or refuse visas on grounds of antisemitism.",

    "body": "US accused of using illegal workers at centre processing refugee claims in South Africa15 hours agoKhanyisile NgcoboJohannesburgSouth Africa has accused the US of using Kenyan nationals without work permits at a facility processing applications by white South Africans for refugee status.Seven Kenyans were arrested after intelligence reports revealed that people \"had recently entered South Africa on tourist visas and had illegally taken up work\" at the centre, said a statement from South Africa's department of home affairs.Washington accused South Africa of \"interference\" in its efforts to admit white Afrikaners as refugees, in a response issued to Agence France-Presse. The US is offering asylum status to Afrikaners as it says the community is facing persecution. South Africa's government has rejected the claims.The US has reduced its yearly intake of refugees from around the world from 125,000 to 7,500, but says it will prioritise Afrikaners, who are mostly descendants of Dutch and French settlers.This is one of the issues that have caused a sharp deterioration in relations between South Africa and the Trump administration. South Africa says the Kenyan nationals arrested in Tuesday's raid will now be deported and will be banned from entering the country for five years.They had previously been denied work visas but were found \"engaging in work despite only being in possession of tourist visas, in clear violation of their conditions of entry into the country\", the statement said.South Africa also expressed concern that foreign officials appeared to have coordinated with undocumented workers and said it had reached out to the US and Kenya to resolve the matter.The home affairs department said the raid showcased the commitment that South Africa shared \"with the United States to combating illegal immigration and visa abuse in all its forms\".No US officials were arrested and the operation was not at a diplomatic site, it said.While the State Department is yet to respond to the BBC's request for comment, in a statement issued to US publications, Tommy Pigott, principal deputy spokesperson for the State Department, said the department was \"seeking immediate clarification from the South African government\" on the issue and expected \"full cooperation and accountability\".\"Interfering in our refugee operations in unacceptable,\" US publication The Hill quoted Pigott saying.The processing of applications by white South Africans is being done by RSC Africa, according to the US embassy in South Africa. RSC Africa is a Kenyan-based refugee support centre operated by Church World Service (CWS).The BBC has asked RSC Africa for comment.US President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that Afrikaners are being subjected to a \"genocide\" in South Africa, even though there is no evidence that white farmers are more likely to be the victims of crime than their black counterparts. He offered Afrikaners refugee status earlier this year after South African President Cyril Ramaphosa signed a law allowing the government to seize land without compensation in rare instances.A first group of about 50 people flew to the US on a chartered plane - it is not clear how many others have moved, or are in the process of applying.Because of the legacy of the racist apartheid system, the majority of privately owned farmland in South Africa is owned by the white community and South Africa's government is under pressure to provide more land to black farmers. However, it stresses that no land has yet been seized under the new law.South Africa has repeatedly tried to mend fences with the Trump administration, most famously when Ramaphosa led a high-level delegation to the White House earlier this year. However, this backfired when Trump ambushed him with images, videos and news reports allegedly showing that the government was persecuting white people. One video featured firebrand South African opposition figure Julius Malema singing: \"Shoot the Boer [Afrikaner], Shoot the farmer\".However, a South African court has ruled that this song, which Malema often chants at his political rallies, is not hate speech.Last month, the US boycotted the G20 summit in South Africa and has said it would not invite South African officials to its meetings since it took over leadership of the grouping of the world's biggest economies.Additional reporting by Mayeni Jones",

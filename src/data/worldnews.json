    "body": "A Chicago man who allegedly doused a woman in gasoline and lit her on fire on 17 November was a \"career criminal\", the White House has said. Lawrence Reed who was arrested for the crime had 72 prior arrests that include eight felony convictions and seven misdemeanours, according to the White House. The victim, 26-year-old Bethany MaGee, survived the attack but is \"now fighting for her life with horrific burns\", the White house said in a statement.In court on Monday, Mr Reed yelled three times in succession \"I'm guilty\", after the judge warned he could receive a life sentence for charges that include committing a terrorist attack, according to reports from inside the courtroom. The White House has sought to blame the incident on Democrats' policies on crime, casting them as \"soft\". Both the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago are led by Democrats, and President Donald Trump is currently seeking to withhold federal funds from Illinois over its elimination of \"cash bail\", where an arrested person posts a sum of money to be released from jail before trial.The suspect \"was walking free because of the radical, dangerous 'no cash bail' law proudly signed by Governor JB Pritzker and celebrated by Chicago's defund-the-police Mayor Brandon Johnson\", the White House said in a statement it released on Tuesday. Mayor Johnson said in a statement that the attack \"was a tragic incident, and the Mayor's prayers are with the victim and her family.\"Mr Reed, 50, has a history of mental illness and has been arrested 72 times since he turned 18, according to a Chicago affiliate of the BBC's partner CBS News.In August, he was charged with aggravated battery for allegedly hitting a social worker and after his arrest was released with electronic monitoring against prosecutors' objections. The attack against Ms MaGee happened while she was \"minding her own business and reading her phone\", prosecutors said. According to the criminal complaint, she was approached by Mr Reed arriving from the back of the train car who then doused her with gasoline before she ran.As he chased her, the complaint said, Mr Reed ignited the rest of the liquid in the bottle and set Ms MaGee on fire. Footage of the incident appeared to show Mr Reed watching Ms MaGee as she rolled on the floor engulfed in flames attempting to extinguish the fire. Last week,  Mayor Johnson said the attack \"should have never happened\", characterising it as \"an absolute failure of our criminal justice as well as our mental health institutions\". He said the suspect clearly faced mental health challenges and presented a danger to himself and the community.As a county commissioner, Johnson in 2020 introduced a nonbinding resolution to redirect funds from police and jails to other public services, but while running for mayor in 2023 he promised not to cut police spending.",

    "description": "Venezuela has banned six major international airlines from landing in the country after they failed to meet a 48-hour deadline to resume flights there",
    "body": "Venezuela has banned six major international airlines from landing in the country after they failed to meet a 48-hour deadline to resume flights there.The airlines had temporarily suspended their routes into the capital, Caracas, after the US warned of \"heightened military activity\" in the area.Angered by this, the Venezuelan government issued the carriers with an ultimatum that expired on Wednesday. While a number of smaller airlines continue to fly to Venezuela, thousands of passengers have been affected.The US has deployed a large force to waters off Venezuela, which it says is to combat drug trafficking but which Venezuela's leader has denounced as an attempt to overthrow him. Venezuela's civil aviation authority, which reports to the country's ministry of transport, announced on Wednesday that Iberia, TAP Portugal, Gol, Latam, Avianca and Turkish Airlines would lose their landing and take-off rights with immediate effect.In a reference to the heightened US military activity off the coast of Venezuela, it also accused the airlines of \"joining the actions of state terrorism promoted by the United States government and unilaterally suspending air commercial operations\".The US has deployed 15,000 troops and the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, to within striking distance of Venezuela.Tracking build-up of US military planes and warships near VenezuelaThe US says the aim of the deployment, the largest by the US in the region since it invaded Panama in 1989, is to combat drug trafficking.US forces have carried out at least 21 strikes on boats they say were carrying drugs, killing more than 80 people. However, they have not provided evidence that the boats carried drugs and many analysts have pointed out that the US deployment is unusually large for a counter-narcotics operation. The Venezuelan government thinks the aim of the operation is to depose President Nicolás Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced by the Venezuelan opposition and many foreign nations as rigged. Amid the rising tensions, the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) issued a warning on Friday to flight operators operating in Maiquetía, the international airport serving Caracas. It urged airlines \"to exercise caution... at all altitudes due to the worsening security situation and heightened military activity in and around Venezuela\".It was in the wake of that warning that the now-banned airlines suspended their flights to Venezuela. An attempt by aviation industry body Iata to defuse the situation - by stressing that its member airlines were keen to restore operations - failed to appease the Venezuelan government.In recent days, both Maduro and his US counterpart Donald Trump have signalled a willingness to hold direct talks.Asked about it on Air Force One, Trump said that he \"might talk\" to Maduro, but also warned that \"we can do things the easy way, that's fine, and if we have to do it the hard way that's fine, too\".Maduro, meanwhile, uploaded a video of himself driving around Caracas pointing to Christmas decorations, in what appeared to be an attempt to show that life in the city was going on as normal.",

    "body": "Police in Malawi are investigating how four police dogs went missing from a presidential palace in the capital, Lilongwe, during the political transition in September.Godfrey Arthur Jalale, who served as State House deputy chief of staff under former President Lazarus Chakwera, has been arrested in connection with the theft of the four German Shepherds. He denies the charge. Chakwera vacated the palace after losing the elections to President Peter Mutharika, who made a stunning comeback. Late on Wednesday, police denied reports that Chakwera had been arrested but confirmed securing a search warrant for his residence after information suggested the stolen dogs were being kept there.Chakwera, who came second with 33% of the vote in the September vote, is facing numerous allegations of public resources mismanagement, especially during the handover.His Malawi Congress Party (MCP) has accused Mutharika's administration of  \"harassing and intimidating\" the former leader. Chakwera has not commented.Local media have reported the theft of state property from two presidential residences - the Kamuzu Palace, and Sanjika Palace, in Blantyre, the country's second biggest city.The four dogs, valued at $2,300 (£1,700), were taken out of the palace between 19 September and 4 October, according to the state prosecutors. In a statement on Wednesday, police said they had \"intensified investigations following reports of property looting\" from Kamuzu Palace.  \"The Malawi Police Service assures the public that the investigation is progressing smoothly,\" it added. MCP MPs boycotted parliamentary sessions on Wednesday and camped out at Chakwera's residence in Lilongwe amid reports that he faced arrest following a heightened police presence, local media reported.Chakwera, a pastor before entering politics, conceded defeat and has kept a low profile since he lost the vote. He made his first public appearance last week when he announced that he had accepted a Commonwealth appointment to help mediate in Tanzania's post-election unrest. Mutharika, who first served as president between 2014 and 2020, campaigned on a pledge of a \"return to proven leadership\" - which resonated with Malawian voters. He returned to power in a country that is in deep crisis, with a severe shortage of fuel and foreign currency.The former law professor was rarely seen in public during the campaign, in contrast to Chakwera who held numerous rallies across Malawi.As a result, speculation about Mutharika's health is rife and there are questions about whether he has the stamina to lead Malawi again at the age of 85.",

    "body": "'Once in 300 years' rain hits Thai city as floods ravage South East Asia1 day agoKelly NgWatch: People cling to floating debris during catastrophic floods in ThailandParts of Thailand are battling record floods, which have killed at least 33 people and prompted authorities to deploy military ships and helicopters to support relief efforts.The deluge has hit 10 provinces across the country's south over the past week, with the city of Hat Yai, a business hub bordering Malaysia, recording its heaviest rainfall in 300 years - 335mm in a single day.Photos show vehicles and houses submerged in the city, while desperate residents await rescue on their rooftops.Relentless rains have also ravaged neighbouring countries. In Vietnam, the death toll has risen to 98 in a week, while in Malaysia, more than 19,000 people have been forced from their homes.In Indonesia, at least 19 people have been killed and at least seven others remained buried under landslides in North Sumatra, according to the Indonesian National Search and Rescue Agency.More than 2 million people in Thailand have been affected by the floods, but just 13,000 have been moved to shelters. The vast majority are cut off and unable to get help, according to Reuters news agency.The Thai military, which has been put in charge of tackling the crisis, said it is preparing to dispatch an aircraft carrier and a flotilla of 14 boats loaded with relief supplies, along with field kitchens that are said to be able to deliver 3,000 meals a day.Medical teams on board the aircraft carrier will convert it into a \"floating hospital\" if required, the navy said.ReutersA drone view shows dozens of vehicles at least partially submerged in a carpark Hat YaiBoats, high-clearance trucks, and jet skis have also been deployed to evacuate residents, said the governor of Songkhla province, where Hat Yai is located.The cabinet on Tuesday declared Songkhla a disaster zone, freeing up funds for relief.However, many people remain stranded amid the rising waters. A volunteer rescue group, the Matchima Rescue Center, told Reuters it had been inundated with thousands of calls in the last three days, with people asking to be evacuated.People have also posted urgent calls for help on Matchima's Facebook page. \"Many people are trapped... Please help,\" one user wrote. \"It's very difficult right now. The water has reached the second floor, where there are children, the elderly, the sick, and the disabled!!!\" Another wrote that his household had been waiting for help for three days: \"Every second is crucial now... Please help share. My [phone's] battery is at 40%. Thank you everyone.\"Some also wrote about not having had any food and water for days.A clip that has gone viral on social media shows three young boys hanging from power lines, trying to inch their way to safety while brown murky waters continue to rise below them.In Malaysia, more than 19,000 people have been evacuated to safety, with 126 evacuation centres set up in the northern border areas.In the states of Kelantan and Perlis, rescue teams waded through knee-deep floodwaters to evacuate residents in areas where rising waters had cut off access to roads.Heavy seasonal rain is common around this time of year in South East Asia, but this year has seen exceptionally high levels of flooding in the region.ReutersThe Thai military said it is preparing to dispatch an aircraft carrier and a flotilla of 14 boats loaded with relief supplies",

    "body": "2 hours agoAleem MaqboolReligion editor, travelling with Pope Leo XIVAnadolu via Getty ImagesPope Leo will mark the 1,700th anniversary of a landmark Church council during his visit to TurkeyPope Leo XIV has arrived in Turkey at the start of the first foreign trip of his papacy, where he will mark an historic Christian anniversary, before heading to Lebanon days after Israeli airstrikes on its capital, Beirut.As he travelled to Ankara, the Pope summed up the message of his trip by saying that \"all men, women can truly be brothers and sisters, in spite of differences, in spite of different religions, in spite of different beliefs\".Visits to both countries had originally been planned by the late Pope Francis, but the overarching theme – building bridges – is one Pope Leo has made his own from the moment he stepped on to the balcony of St Peter's Basilica after his election in May.Since he became pontiff six months ago, he has conveyed a sense of being extremely measured, even cautious. But on this trip, his powers of diplomacy will be closely scrutinised.A key moment of the trip will take place in the Turkish town of Iznik, the site of the ancient city of Nicaea. Pope Leo and leaders of other Christian traditions will gather to mark the anniversary of an ancient council that took place there 1,700 years ago.  In 325 AD, among other key decisions, more than 200 bishops at the council affirmed the belief that Jesus was the son of God, eventually leading to what is known as the Nicene Creed.Eastern and Western branches of Christianity later dramatically split, but during this trip there will be messages of togetherness and healing divisions.In Turkey the Pope will also visit the Blue Mosque, as both his immediate predecessors Pope Francis and Pope Benedict XVI had done. He will have meetings with other religious leaders in a gesture of inter-religious dialogue before flying on to the second leg of the trip.EPAThe Pope plans to visit the Blue Mosque in IstanbulThe Vatican says plans for the Pope's visit to Lebanon have not changed following the Israeli airstrikes on Beirut earlier in the week.He will meet more faith leaders and hear from young people in Lebanon, his visit giving a boost in particular to the estimated third of the country that is Christian.On the final day of the trip, Pope Leo will celebrate Mass at the Beirut waterfront at the site of the 2020 port explosion, praying for the more than 200 people who were killed and 7,000 others injured.Over recent months, though he has spoken out on some issues dear to him such as the dignity of migrants, he has certainly not been as overtly political as his predecessor could be.He has walked such a fine line that in some cases both progressives and traditionalists within the Catholic Church have made the case that he supports their school of thought.It was for similar reasons that cardinals of different persuasions were thought to have coalesced around him at conclave.Pope Francis was seen as a visionary but one who was not overly worried about creating consensus, leaving behind a somewhat divided Church. Pope Leo has so far operated very differently, gently holding on to some of the progressive ideals of his predecessor while paying heed to the views of traditionalists.He has repeatedly called for an end to war, but in a different way to Pope Francis, who memorably made daily calls to the Holy Family Church in Gaza to offer his support.ReutersThe Pope met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the Presidential Palace in Ankara on ThursdayIn meetings on this trip - with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Lebanese civic leaders - Pope Leo may be drawn to comment on his views on conflict in the region.We may hear something of his impressions at the end of his trip, as it is customary for the Pope to hold a news conference with travelling press on the return flight to Rome.What we will hear more of this trip is a pope speaking in a Chicagoan accent. Although Pope Leo, who speaks several languages fluently, has mainly given public addresses in Italian up to this point, the Vatican has confirmed that he will speak English throughout the Turkish leg of his trip, with some French too during his time in Lebanon.",

    "body": "1 hour agoJames ChaterWatch: US President Donald Trump says alleged gunman was Afghan nationalThe US has suspended processing all immigration requests from Afghans, after an Afghan man was identified as the suspect in the shooting of two National Guard soldiers near the White House.The US Citizenship and Immigration Services said the decision was made pending a review of \"security and vetting protocols\".The suspect of Wednesday's shooting, which left two National Guard members critically injured, is said to have arrived in the US from Afghanistan in September 2021.US President Donald Trump said the attack was an \"act of terror\", adding that he would take steps to remove foreigners \"from any country who does not belong here\". Tens of thousands of Afghans entered the US under special immigration protections following the chaotic US withdrawal from the country in 2021 under former President Joe Biden.The Department of Homeland Security named the suspect in a press release as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, \"a criminal alien from Afghanistan\". It said Lakanwal had entered the US during the presidency of Joe Biden in September 2021, under a programme for Afghans named called Operation Allies Welcome.At the time, the Taliban had taken back control of Afghanistan following a chaotic withdrawal of US forces.  An official told the BBC's US news partner CBS that Lakanwal had applied for asylum in 2024, and that his application had been granted earlier this year. Lakanwal's is reportedly 29 years old, and he is said to not be co-operating with authorities' investigation.Trump said following the shooting that the US \"must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden\".The Joint Task Force DC, which is co-ordinating the National Guard deployments to the nation's capital, said the attack took place at around 14:15 EST (19:15 GMT) on Wednesday near the Farragut Square Metro Station.The soldiers had been on a high-visibility patrol near the corner of 17th and I streets - a busy lunch spot for office workers.Metropolitan Police Assistant Chief Jeff Carroll said the suspect \"came around the corner\" and \"immediately started firing\", adding that the soldiers had been \"ambushed\".Other National Guard members nearby heard the gunfire and intervened, holding the suspect down until police arrived, he said.The suspect was shot four times, law enforcement sources told CBS.One witness described to the BBC his experience of hearing gunshots, as people ran in panic and tried to take shelter in a nearby shop.Another witness, who was in his car close to the metro station, showed the BBC footage he took of the two soldiers lying on the street in their uniforms while being treated by medics. Details on the identities of the soldiers have not yet been provided by officials.A third person, apparently the alleged gunman, was also seen on the pavement being treated.In the wake of the attack, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the president had asked him to send 500 more National Guard members to the American capital.\"This will only stiffen our resolve to ensure that we make Washington DC safe and beautiful,\" the Pentagon chief said.There are currently nearly 2,200 National Guard troops in the city.They are a reservist force that can be activated to serve as military troops, but have limited power as they cannot enforce the law or make arrests.The troops were deployed in August to tackle what Trump called \"out of control\" crime in Washington.Overall crime in the city has fallen since the force was sent, which Trump credits to the troops' presence on the streets.There have been similar deployments in other Democratic-led cities across the US, which have faced legal challenges by opponents who accuse the Trump administration of overreach.Watch: How the shooting of two National Guard members unfoldedTrump imposed a travel ban on nationals of Afghanistan - and 11 other countries - earlier this year.Afghan nationals holding Special Immigration Visas - available to those who worked directly with the US military and feared retribution from the Taliban as a result of that co-operation - were among a few exceptions to the sweeping bans. The Taliban returned to power following the US withdrawal in 2021.Trump has also ended a programme that granted deportation protections for thousands of people from Afghanistan.The temporary protected status programme allowed migrants to get work permits if the US government deemed it unsafe for them to return to their home countries due to war.Additional reporting by Tom BatemanFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has described as \"regrettable\" the announcement by US President Donald Trump that South Africa would not be invited to take part in next year's G20 summit in Florida.In a social media post, Trump said South Africa had refused to hand over the G20 presidency to a US embassy representative at last week's summit in Johannesburg.\"Therefore, at my direction, South Africa will NOT be receiving an invitation to the 2026 G20, which will be hosted in the Great City of Miami, Florida next year.\"Members of the G20 – a gathering of the world's biggest economies - do not need an invite but can possibly be barred through visa restrictions.Trump boycotted the Johannesburg summit because of a widely discredited claim that South Africa's white minority is the victim of large-scale killings and land grabs.Ramaphosa said in a statement that the US had been expected to participate in the G20 meetings, \"but unfortunately, it elected not to attend the G20 Leaders Summit in Johannesburg out of its own volition\". He however noted that some US businesses and civil society entities were present.He said that since the US delegation was not there, \"instruments of the G20 Presidency were duly handed over to a US Embassy official at the Headquarters of South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation\".The low-key handover appears to have further angered Trump, who has been critical of the South African government's domestic and foreign policies.He has in the past claimed that a white genocide was taking place in South Africa, and on Wednesday he said the government was \"killing white people and randomly allowing their farms to be taken from them\".The South African government has consistently rejected such claims as widely discredited and lacking reliable evidence.Ramaphosa said it was regrettable that despite efforts to reset relations with the US, Trump continued \"to apply punitive measures against South Africa based on misinformation and distortions about our country\".In the Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump said South Africa had \"demonstrated to the world they were not a country worthy of membership anywhere\" and announced a stop to \"all payments and subsidies to them, effective immediately\".South African officials have called for solidarity and urged other G20 members to defend the integrity of the gathering and the rights of all its member states.The G20 summit, which was for the first time held in Africa, ended with a joint declaration committing to \"multilateral co-operation\" on climate change mitigation and economic inequality.The declaration was adopted despite objections from the US, which has accused South Africa of weaponising its leadership of the group this year.Additional reporting by Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg",

    "body": "1 day agoHafsa KhalilWatch: Trump says Witkoff doing \"standard negotiation\" in talks with RussiaDonald Trump has defended his special envoy Steve Witkoff as doing the \"standard thing\" after a leaked recording appeared to show him advising a Russian official on how to appeal to the US president.Trump told reporters on Wednesday that he had not heard the audio, but that Witkoff was doing \"what a dealmaker does\" to \"sell\" a US-authored peace plan to both Russia and Ukraine.The leaked call from last month emerged days after the 28-point draft peace plan was presented by the US, which largely reflected Russian positions on ending its full-scale war in Ukraine.Witkoff has visited Moscow several times this year and will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin again next week.He has never gone to Kyiv in his role as special envoy, though other US officials have visited and US army secretary Dan Driscoll went to Kyiv this week. Trump says he will hold further talks with the Ukrainians.Diplomatic talks have continued after the initial draft plan was criticised by Ukrainian and European leaders as being too favourable to Russia. Among the proposals was handing Russia territory in eastern Ukraine currently controlled by Kyiv. The plan has since been revised to better reflect Ukraine's interests and the views of European allies. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he was ready to meet Trump to discuss outstanding \"sensitive points\".In the leaked audio recording obtained and shared as a transcript by Bloomberg, Witkoff appeared to advise Yuri Ushakov, Putin's foreign policy adviser, on how to get on Trump's good side.BBC News has not independently verified the reported 14 October call, but Trump said it represented a \"very standard form of negotiations\". During the leaked conversation, the two men reportedly talked about ending the war, with Ushakov asking if it would be useful to get their bosses - Putin and Trump - to speak.Witkoff is quoted as saying that \"my guy is ready to do it\", before suggesting how to go about the call.\"Just reiterate that you congratulate the president [Trump] on this achievement... that you respect that he is a man of peace and you're just, you're really glad to have seen it happen,\" Witkoff is quoted as saying. \"I think from that it's going to be a really good call.\"\"I told the president that you - that the Russian Federation has always wanted a peace deal. That's my belief,\" Witkoff adds, according to the transcript. \"The issue is is that we have two nations that are having a hard time coming to a compromise.\"He continues: \"I'm even thinking that maybe we set out like a 20-point peace proposal, just like we did in Gaza.\"The call ends with Witkoff telling Ushakov of an imminent Zelensky visit to the White House, and that \"if possible\", Trump and Putin should talk before that meeting.What followed was a two-and-a-half hour phone call between the US and Russian presidents, news of which emerged as Zelensky was on his way to Washington last month.Before the Trump-Putin call, the US president had appeared to be running out of patience with his Russian counterpart and had suggested he might provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles.By the time Zelensky entered the White House, the atmosphere seemed to have changed. Trump said giving Kyiv Tomahawks could escalate the conflict and that he believed Putin \"wants to end the war\".Asked about the call being leaked, Yuri Ushakov told Russian state media that it was done to \"hinder, probably\" and that it was \"unlikely\" to be done to improve relations.He also confirmed that Witkoff would be visiting Moscow next week as per a \"preliminary agreement\".It was not clear who was behind the leak, but Bloomberg has also transcribed another reported call between Ushakov and Putin envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who spent days with Witkoff in Miami in late October weeks before the 28-point draft plan emerged.According to that transcript, Dmitriev tells his Russian colleague: \"We'll just make this paper from our position, and I'll informally pass it along, making it clear that it's all informal. And let them do like their own.\"Apparently angered by the report, Dmitriev complained of a \"well-funded, well-organised malicious media machine built to spread fake narratives, smear opponents and keep people confused\".",

    "body": "'I am devastated': Hong Kong residents in disbelief after fire destroys blocks of flats14 hours agoPhoebe Kong & Koey Lee,BBC Chinese, in Hong Kong,Danny Vincent,in Hong Kong,andKathryn ArmstrongWatch: Deadly fire engulfs Hong Kong apartment blocks\"When you get closer the heat rises and you can feel it and the smoke is really heavy.\"Student Thomas Liu was one of many people drawn to the scene of a deadly fire that tore through much of the eight-block Wang Fuk Court housing complex in Hong Kong's Tai Po district.At least 44 people have died so far in the devastating blaze that began on Wednesday, and with hundreds still missing, this number is expected to rise. The cause is not yet known, but three construction company executives have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter connected to flammable materials, including mesh and plastic sheets, that may have allowed the fire to spread quickly. \"It's a disaster,\" Thomas said of the fire, telling the BBC he had seen a body being taken away. \"Many people sent us WhatsApp messages or called us, saying they still have relatives inside or can't find them,\" Mui Siu-fung, a councillor for the Tai Po district, told BBC Chinese. More than a thousand other people were forced to evacuate the estate as the flames spread, with some heading to centres that have been set up to house them. Police also moved people from nearby buildings. The fire was gradually being contained but officials said they did not know when it would be fully extinguished. Flames could be seen coming from individual apartments as many people watched on in silence.One woman said her friends live inside the building and she was waiting to hear if they managed to get out.ReutersHarry Cheung has lived in block two of the Wang Fuk Court complex for decadesHarry Cheung, who has lived in block two of the Wang Fuk Court complex for more than 40 years, told Reuters he heard \"a very loud noise\" and saw fire erupt in a nearby block.\"I immediately went back to pack up my things,\" the 66-year-old resident said.\"I don't even know how I feel right now. I'm just thinking about where I'm going to sleep tonight because I probably won't be able to go back home.\"A woman in her sixties, whose surname is Kam and who lives in the adjacent Kwong Fuk Estate, told the South China Morning Post (SCMP) that several of her friends living in Wang Fuk Court had been accounted for - but not all.One friend has daily afternoon naps and may have been sleeping when the fire broke out at 14:51 local time (06:51 GMT), Ms Kam said, adding that the woman's daughters have not yet been able to contact her. Another resident, 65-year-old Jason Kong, told Reuters that a neighbour called him and said he was still trapped inside one of the tower blocks. \"I am devastated. There are so many neighbours and friends. I do not know what is going on anymore. Look, all the apartments are just burning. I do not know what to do. I hope the government can help us to settle down after this.\"An elderly woman who lives in one of the affected blocks told the BBC she was not at home when the fire broke out but that she was worried about her apartment because it was not insured. \"I'm very upset that I have no home to go to now,\" she said. While the cause of the fire that engulfed the multiple high-rise blocks was unknown, police say a mesh material and plastic sheets were found outside the buildings - both of which are not believed to be fireproof. Styrofoam was also found on the building's windows. These materials may have caused the fire to spread more quickly, said police.Some people have expressed anger that such a massive fire could have happened and criticised the response.\"When there's a wildfire, they will deploy helicopters and drop water bombs, but why is there no such deployment and how can they leave other buildings burning?\" Ms Poon, another resident of Wang Fuk Court, who is in her sixties, asked.\"The community is so close to the fire station and we thought the fire could be put out soon, but now the fire has spread. I'm so disappointed,\" she told the SCMP. Ms Poon noted that she had been given no instructions from the government on where to seek help.The BBC spoke to some Tai Po residents who had brought supplies to the victims and affected residents - including dozens of blankets and heat packs.Hong Kong chief executive John Lee said government departments were assisting residents affected by the fire.When asked about their feelings about the fire, the residents said \"the government is incompetent\" and that they were \"immensely heartbroken\".  \"We don't want to see any more casualties,\" said one.

    "body": "13 minutes agoHugh SchofieldIn ParisEPAPresident Macron said the new form of voluntary service was an \"act of trust in our youth\"A limited form of military service will be re-introduced in France in response to growing fears of a confrontation with Russia.More than 25 years after conscription was phased out, the plan will see young men and women volunteering for a paid 10 months of military training.\"The only way to avoid danger is to prepare for it,\" President Emmanuel Macron said while announcing the plan at an infantry base near Grenoble in south-east France. \"We need to mobilise, mobilising the nation to defend itself, to be ready and remain respected.\" The new \"national service\" will be brought in gradually from next summer, mainly for 18- and 19-year-olds, who will receive at least €800 (£700) a month.\"In this uncertain world where might triumphs over right, war is in the present tense,\" said Macron. The armed forces would benefit from motivated young French men and women, he added: \"It is an act of trust in our youth.\"Initially, numbers will be restricted to 3,000 next year, but this should rise to 50,000 by 2035.France currently has around 200,000 military personnel and a further 47,000 reservists. The new scheme should usher in a three-tier structure, comprising professionals, reservists and volunteers.The change brings France in line with other European countries that have launched military service schemes - with varying parameters - because of fears of Russian aggression.Belgium and the Netherlands have introduced a voluntary military service, and Germany is planning something similar.Only this month, the Belgian defence ministry sent letters to 17-year-olds inviting them to volunteer for about €2,000 (£1,750) a month.Further east, Lithuania and Latvia have compulsory schemes, with cadets chosen by lottery. Sweden, which recently joined Nato, has started a nine- to 15-month military service with selection on merit.Some European countries, like Finland and Greece, have never stopped military service, while the Swiss are to vote on Sunday on replacing mandatory service for men with compulsory civic duty for all.Others countries, including the UK and Spain, currently have no plans to re-introduce it.AFP via Getty ImagesFrance began phasing out conscription in the late 1990sFrench military chiefs are broadly in favour of the new measure, which they hope will create a reservoir of trained personnel able to back up professional soldiers and replace them in non-frontline tasks.  It is also hoped many volunteers will stay on to lead full military careers.\"The new military service moves us in the direction of hybridisation of the armed forces,\" Thomas Gassilloud, president of the National Assembly's defence committee, said. \"We went too far in the direction of the all-professional.\"The threat of a looming, if ill-defined, stand-off with Russia has become part of France's national discourse. The government has regularly raised the alert over below-the-radar incidents or attempts by Moscow to poison opinion via social media.Recently, the newly appointed chief-of-staff, Gen Fabien Mandon, took the alarm to a new level when he said French military planning was built around the assumption of a confrontation with Russia in the next three or four years.ReutersGen Fabien Mandon prompted an outcry when he said French opinion had to be prepared for \"losing children\" at warHe went further last week, telling a gathering of mayors that what France lacked was the spirit of sacrifice, urging them to prepare opinion for the possibility of \"losing children\" in war.Immediately condemned by the far-left and part of the far-right, the remarks were also seen as unhelpful by the government, with Macron reassuring the country last weekend that there were no plans to send young recruits to fight in Ukraine.Polls show a large majority of the public in favour of voluntary military service. An Elabe survey this week found that 73% supported the measure. Young people – aged 25-34 – were the least supportive, but even in this age group there was a 60% majority.In a random BBC test of opinion on Paris streets, a similar picture emerged.\"It's a good thing,\" said Louis, a 22-year-old student. \"It can help make the army bigger, but it's also a way to love your nation more.\"Eilan, another student, said: \"In military service you meet people from everywhere. You learn new ways of seeing things... You learn to talk and trust and co-exist with other people.\"\"From what I read in the newspapers, our army is not that powerful - so if we have to prepare for the future, maybe it's a good idea,\" said set-designer Brigitte.But Lalie, a 21-year-old shop assistant, disagreed: \"I think there are more important issues. It's a pity the president is not really interested in young people – their mental health, their financial situation, and instead is focusing on this military service.\"It was in 1996 that then-President Jacques Chirac took the decision to end military service, as part of the peace dividend from the fall of the Soviet Union.Compulsory military training for young men had been part of national life since the French Revolution, which created the idea of the citizen-soldier.A 1798 law setting up conscription read: \"Every Frenchman is a soldier and is bound to the defence of the homeland.\" And after defeat by Prussia in 1871, Republican leader Léon Gambetta said: \"When in France a citizen is born, he is born a soldier.\"The Algerian war of independence was the last conflict fought by French conscripts, with more than 12,000 killed.By the 1990s, service had been reduced to 10 months, with options for civilian work instead.Since the last conscript passed out in 2001 there have been various, nebulous attempts to retain something of the spirit of military service, which proponents said fostered a sense of cohesion and equality.Lycée (high-school) students still have to attend a Day of Defence and Citizenship, where they are given lectures on rights and duties, and attend a flag-raising ceremony.In his first term, Macron also established a Universal National Service – a four-week course in civic responsibilities and practical training – which was supposed to build national solidarity following the terrorist attacks of the 2010s. But the scheme was panned as an expensive and ill-attended form of holiday camp, and was dropped earlier this year.Though this new scheme appears to enjoy a broadly favourable reception, there are still questions over its funding – with a debt crisis looming over the country and parliament still unable to approve a 2026 budget.",

    "body": "5 hours agoNicolas Negoce,Paul Njie,BBC Africa reportersandWedaeli ChibelushiAFP via Getty ImagesThe soldiers gave an address on state TVA group of military officers say they have seized control of Guinea-Bissau amid reports that the president, Umaro Sissoco Embaló, has been arrested.Shortly after gunshots were heard in the capital, Bissau, government sources told the BBC that Embaló had been detained.The officers then appeared on state TV, saying they had suspended the electoral process, as the West African nation awaited the outcome of Sunday's presidential election. They said they were acting to thwart a plot by unnamed politicians who had \"the support of a well-known drug baron\" to destabilise the country, and announced the closure of its borders and imposed a night-time curfew.Sandwiched between Senegal and Guinea, the coup-prone country is  known as a notorious drug-trafficking hub where the military has been influential since independence from Portugal in 1974.The election results were expected on Thursday - both Embaló and his closest rival Fernando Dias had claimed victory.Dias was supported by former Prime Minister Domingos Pereira, who had been disqualified from running.Late on Wednesday afternoon, Embaló told France 24 in a phone call: \"I have been deposed.\"Government sources have since told the BBC that Dias, Pereira and Interior Minister Botché Candé have also been detained.The putschists have taken army chief Gen Biague Na Ntan and his deputy, Gen Mamadou Touré, into custody too, the sources say.In a joint statement, leaders of election observation missions from the African Union and the West African bloc Ecowas expressed \"deep concern with the announcement of a coup d'etat by the armed forces\".They said the country had been prepared for the announcement of the election results after what it described as an \"orderly and peaceful\" process.\"It's regrettable that this announcement came at a time when the missions had just concluded meeting with the two leading presidential candidates, who assured us of their willingness to accept the will of the people,\" they said.Gunshots heard near presidential palace in the capital BissauWitnesses in Bissau heard gunfire earlier on, at around 13:00 GMT, but it was not immediately clear who was involved in the shooting or if there were any casualties.Hundreds of people on foot and in vehicles fled, seeking shelter as the shots rang out, the AFP news agency reported.Later on, General Denis N'Canha, head of the military household at the presidential palace, read out a statement declaring a takeover.He said officers had formed \"the High Military Command for the Restoration of Order\" and instructed the population to \"remain calm\".Checkpoints have been erected across Bissau and the streets were deserted ahead of the curfew, that was due to start at 19:00 GMT.Portugal has called for a return to constitutional order, with its foreign ministry urging \"all those involved to refrain from any act of institutional or civic violence\".The former Portuguese colony has witnessed at least nine coups or attempted coups over the last five decades.Corbis via Getty ImagesPresident Embaló was elected in December 2019Embaló has said he has survived multiple coup attempts during his time in office. However, his critics allege he has fabricated crises in order to crack down on dissent.The 53-year-old had wanted to make history as the country's only president to secure a second consecutive mandate in the last 30 years.He had initially said he would not seek a second term. Prior to the delayed polls, his legitimacy had been questioned, with the opposition saying his term should have officially ended in February 2025.Guinea-Bissau is one of the poorest countries in the world with a population of more than two million people.Its coastline has many uninhabited islands, making it ideal for drug traffickers - with the UN dubbing it a \"narco-state\" as it has been a key transit point for cocaine coming from Latin America to Europe.

    "body": "US transportation secretary wants more civility in air travel. Not everyone is on boardUS Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is urging air travellers to dress better and be more civil - and it's touching a nerve at a time when many Americans consider air travel more frustrating than ever. Ahead of what's expected to be the busiest Thanksgiving travel season in 15 years, Duffy launched a campaign last week titled \"The Golden Age of Travel Starts with You\", in which he harked back to the 1950s and 60s to call for a return to civility and class in air travel. But as air traffic controllers remain short-staffed and customers face frequent flight delays, both social media users and aviation experts say Duffy is missing the point. A video advert for the Department of Transportation's campaign juxtaposes old footage of smiling airport staff and orderly passengers with modern social media videos of people starting fights on planes, putting their bare feet up on seats and engaging in other disruptive behaviour. \"Manners don't stop at the gate. Things aren't what they used to be,\" Duffy chimes in. \"Let's bring civility and manners back. Ask yourself, are you helping a pregnant woman put her bag in the overhead bin? Are you dressing with respect?\"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) predicts this week will be the busiest Thanksgiving travel season in 15 years - with more than 52,000 flights on 25 November alone. And aviation experts say Duffy's message won't have much effect on the flying atmosphere. Scott Keyes, an air travel expert and founder of the flight deals site Going.com, told the BBC that, while it sounds great to ask everyone to just be nicer to each other, in terms of the actual efficacy of that message, \"you might as well ask a wall to start printing you money\". \"Very few people show up for their flight itching to pick a fight with another passenger,\" Mr Keyes said. And once they reach the level of agitation where they've started picking a fight with a flight attendant or passenger, he said they're unlikely to remember Duffy's words or calm down. The underlying problem, he argues, is people letting their tempers get the best of them, which he sees as a worsening problem across all of society, not just on airplanes, and not just in the US. Since the secretary started posting about the campaign on X, some of his subsequent posts have been flooded with thousands of comments critical of Duffy's message.\"If you want us to be respectful humans at the airport stop treating us like cattle,\" one X user commented. \"Remove the demoralising and humiliating TSA checks (that accomplish nothing) and find a way to get the airlines to give more than 2 inches of space per seat.\"Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and president of Atmosphere Research Group, told the BBC that, while Duffy makes a valid point that being considerate was important, his call to dress nicer won't change a thing. \"You could be dressed in black tie and still be a jerk, and you could be wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt and be the most considerate person in the world. The clothes, in this case, do not make the person,\" Mr Harteveldt said. A number of commenters on Duffy's X post have pointed out that the reason they dress so casually is because of how cramped plane cabins have become, as well as the expectation of extended delays. \"Tell you what,\" one X user commented. \"You get the planes running on time, and we won't dress to spend the night in the damn airport.\" Another wrote: \"Can I get my legroom back?\"One X user, who has nearly 500,000 followers, posted: \"Duffy is absolutely right...BUT our declining travel dress is also a reflection of how airlines treat us. Cattle boarding, tiny seats, penny pinching every beverage cost and just generally miserable.\" Echoing what many social media users have pointed out, Mr Harteveldt said the airlines bore some responsibility for passengers' bad behaviour, too, by making their \"economy cabins so unpleasant and so physically uncomfortable\" that they naturally put passengers in a bad mood. Couple that with minimal flight attendant staffing, minimal amenities on board, and the airlines' embrace of the pay-for-what-you-want business model, \"you don't get people smiling as they walk down the loading bridge to the plane,\" he said. Still, others have praised the secretary's core message of respect and kindness, with one commenting: \"I will do my small part to spread civility in my own life.\"The Department of Transportation (DOT) says the campaign isn't only about saying \"please\" and \"thank you\" - it's also about reducing the amount of violent and disruptive incidents on airplanes and in airports. The agency says that since 2019 there's been a 400% increase in in-flight outbursts, including both unruly behaviour and violent attacks. Since 2021, the department has recorded 13,800 unruly passenger incidents, while one in five attendants have experienced a physical incident.But experts dispute that air travel has declined in quality. Dan Bubb, an aviation historian and professor at University of Nevada Las Vegas, told the BBC that, despite the rise in incivility cases, statistically that number wasn't very significant. There are far more travellers and flights now than there used to be, and Prof Bubb said that makes it difficult to compare today's airline incidents with past decades. Mr Keyes pointed out what he sees as another major issue with Duffy's message: air travel used to bring a host of other issues we no longer face today. \"It's laughable how much worse air travel was back then,\" Mr Keyes said. Flying was far less safe, he said, noting that planes crashed and were hijacked more frequently. Flights were also far more expensive relative to income. Among other drawbacks: the cabins were filled with cigarette smoke, and flight attendants faced rampant sexism and stringent physical requirements. Mr Keyes believes the FAA and DOT could make more of a difference in reducing passenger stress by pushing airlines to minimise the number of delays and cancellations. Prof Bubb said it would also help to \"give passengers a little more physical space in terms of seat size and legroom, include meal service in the price of their tickets, reduce alcohol consumption, make going through security at airports less stressful, make parking at airports easier, expand boarding area space at airport gates\". And, he added, we do still need to encourage passengers to be courteous to flight crews and each other.",

    "body": "1 hour agoGeorge Wright and Andre Rhoden-PaulReutersIsrael has received the body of a hostage after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was expecting the remains of a soldier killed in 2014 to be returned.The body was being taken to be formally identified, the Israeli military said.Earlier, Netanyahu said Israel was due to receive the body of Hadar Goldin, a soldier who was killed in an ambush by Hamas during a previous conflict in 2014 and whose body has been held in Gaza since then. Hamas's armed wing also said on Sunday that it would hand over Hadar Goldin's body.If the body is confirmed to be Lt Goldin's, Hamas will have returned all 20 living hostages and 24 out of 28 deceased hostages under the first phase of a ceasefire deal.Netanyahu said Lt Goldin's family would now be able to give him a Jewish burial and reiterated his intention to bring back the bodies of all deceased hostages.  \"We have returned 250 so far. We will bring them all back,\" he said. On Saturday Lt Goldin's family said \"an entire nation is waiting for Hadar to be returned to us\". \"We are waiting for official confirmation that Hadar has returned to Israel. We don't give up on anyone in this country, ever. We ask everyone to remain calm. Until it's final, it's not over,\" the family said in a statement.ReutersIDF soldier Hadar Goldin was killed in Gaza in 2014Lt Goldin, from Kfar Saba, is the only deceased hostage whose remains were being held in Gaza before the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, which sparked the latest war. He was killed in combat on 1 August 2014, not long after the start of a ceasefire in that year's war between Israel and Hamas. He was among a group of Israeli soldiers who were patrolling an agricultural area near Rafah in southern Gaza when they were attacked by a group of Hamas fighters. The Israeli military determined that Lt Goldin was killed along with two other soldiers in a firefight, and that his body was then dragged into an underground tunnel by the Hamas fighters.The Israeli military unleashed massive firepower to try to prevent Hamas from taking Lt Goldin hostage. Scores of Palestinian civilians were killed in the bombardment of Rafah, which continued for four days, including after Lt Goldin was declared dead.On Saturday, the Israeli military said it had identified a body handed over from Gaza as that of Israeli-Argentinian Lior Rudaeff.Also on Saturday, two Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire in Gaza. The Israeli military said two people had crossed the yellow line that marks the line of Israeli control in Gaza and posed an \"immediate threat\".Israeli military actions have killed at least 241 people since the start of the ceasefire, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage. At least 69,169 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, the health ministry reported.",

    "body": "Super typhoon makes landfall in Philippines as nearly a million evacuated9 minutes agoKathryn Armstrong, André Rhoden-Paul and Lulu Luo,Aurora, Philippines The BBC's Jonathan Head says the Philippines is braced for an \"absolutely massive storm\"Typhoon Fung-wong has made landfall in the Philippines, where more than 900,000 people have been evacuated and two people have died.The storm was upgraded to a super typhoon before hitting land, with sustained winds of around 185 km/h (115mph) and gusts of 230km/h (143mph). The eye of the storm hit Aurora province in Luzon - the Philippine's most populous island - at 21:10 local time (13:10 GMT). The country's meteorological service warned there is a \"high-risk of life-threatening and damaging storm surge\" as the typhoon moves north-westerly across Luzon.Fung-wong - known locally as Uwan - comes days after an earlier storm, Kalmaegi, left a trail of destruction and nearly 200 people dead.Eastern parts of the Philippines had already begun experiencing heavy rains and winds on Saturday evening, a weather official said. Residents in Catanduanes, an island in the east of the Bicol region, as well as in other low-lying and coastal areas, had been urged to move to higher ground by Sunday morning.The storm passed near the eastern Bicol region on Sunday morning, before making its way past the Polillo Islands on Sunday afternoon.The civil defence office reported that one person drowned and firefighters recovered the body of a woman trapped under debris in Catbalogan City. The civil aviation regulator has closed several airports, and almost 300 flights have been cancelled. Fung-wong was expected to weaken after making landfall, but is likely to remain a typhoon as it travels over Luzon.More than 200mm of rain is forecast for parts of Luzon, with even 100-200mm in the Metro Manilla area. This is expected to cause severe flooding and landslides.  CHARISM SAYAT/AFP via Getty ImageA landslide-hit residential area in Guinobatan town, Albay province, south of ManilaIn the Aurora region, in eastern Luzon, BBC News spoke to Hagunoy, 21, who works at one of the dozen hotels which line the coast in Sabang.He said police had repeatedly visited in recent days to ensure all guests were evacuated ahead of the storm. The hotels were all deserted on Sunday morning.While the tide had risen sharply, Hagunoy said he would stay as long as he could to guard the property, before riding his motorbike home to safety. Staff had secured the gates and tied windows shut with rope to try to stop the glass from shattering in the wind.EPA/ShutterstockThe Filipino Coast Guard undertook evacuations ahead of the typhoon in Quezon provinceIn central Aurora, more than 200 people arrived at a shelter in a sports centre. Many parents have brought young children, too young to remember Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,000 people when it struck the Philippines in 2013. \"We felt very worried because of the strength of the typhoon, and we have young children to think of,\" Jessa Zurbano told the BBC.Another evacuee Patry Azul said: \"Our house is made of wood and flimsy materials. We live close to the sea so we didn't feel safe.\"Fung-wong has also forced the suspension of rescue operations following the passage of Kalmaegi, one of the strongest typhoons this year.Heavy rainfall sent torrents of mud down hillsides and into residential areas. Some poorer neighbourhoods were obliterated by the fast-moving flash floods.At least 204 people are now known to have died in the Philippines as a result of the earlier storm, while more than 100 are still missing. Five people also died in Vietnam, where strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows.Families gathered at this shelter in a sports centre in central Aurora in eastern LuzonThe Filipino government declared a state of calamity across the country after Typhoon Kalmaegi and in preparation for the coming storm.It has given government agencies more power to access emergency funds and fast-track deliveries of essential goods and services.For some Filipinos, the devastation wrought by Kalmaegi has left them even more anxious about the storm to come.\"We decided to evacuate because the recent typhoon brought floods in our area, and now I just want to keep my family safe,\" Norlito Dugan told the AFP news agency.He is among those who have taken shelter in a church in the city of Sorsogon in Luzon.Another resident, Maxine Dugan said: \"I'm here because the waves near my house are now huge.\"How do hurricanes or typhoons form and are they getting stronger?The Philippines - located near the area where Pacific Ocean tropical weather systems form - is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to cyclones.About 20 tropical cyclones form in that region every year, half of which affect the country directly.Climate change is not thought to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones worldwide.However, warmer oceans coupled with a warmer atmosphere - fuelled by climate change - have the potential to make those that do form even more intense. That can potentially lead to higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall, and a greater risk of coastal flooding.",

    "body": "18 hours agoGeorge WrightGetty ImagesTens of thousands have taken to the streets of Portugal's capital, Lisbon, to protest against proposed labour laws which they say threaten workers' rights.The centre-right government wants to make it easier for employers to fire people,  outsource work to other companies, and limit some types of compassionate leave, including cutting bereavement leave for women who suffer miscarriages.It says the measures are needed to improve job flexibility and increase productivity in one of western Europe's poorest countries.The head of Portugal's largest union, CGTP, called the reforms \"one of the greatest attacks ever made against workers\" in the country and announced a general strike for 11 December.The bill is likely to pass in parliament with support from far-right party Chega.The union told Reuters that around 100,000 protesters filled Lisbon's main avenue, while the Associated Press also reported tens of thousands of people were present. No police estimate was available.Speaking at the protest, Miriam Alves, 31, a worker at a medical device company, told Reuters that reforms are \"clearly a step backward in working conditions and could lead to a complete lack of job security\".Archive technician Madalena Pena, 34, said the government was reversing labour rights \"in an unfair, subtle, and cunning way, without having said anything before the election\" in May.CGTP general secretary Tiago Oliveira announced the strike for next month at the protest.On the proposed changes, he said: \"If implemented, it would be a real setback in the lives of each and every one of us.\"Protesters also wanted higher wages. Official data shows more than 50% of workers earned less than 1,000 euros (£879) per month last year. The minimum wage is only 870 euros (£764).",

    "body": "Dozens of people are missing and one person has died after a boat carrying migrants sank near the border between Thailand and Malaysia.The vessel is believed to have capsized near the southern Thai island of Ko Tarutao on Thursday, the Malaysian Coast Guard said. Ten people have been rescued and the body of a woman was found floating in the sea. Maritime officials believe the victims are part of a group of about 300 people who had been travelling on a larger vessel before splitting onto small boats as they approached Malaysia. Those rescued near the Malaysian resort of Langkawi include three Myanmar men, two Rohingya men and one Bangladeshi man, according Malaysia's state-run agency Bernama quoting a police chief. The body found in the water was that of a Rohingya woman, the report added. Efforts to look for more survivors are under way.The mostly-Muslim Rohinga community has fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar in huge number in recent years to escape persecution. Conflict and conditions in refugee camps in Bangladesh have also continued to push vulnerable people onto overcrowded vessels as they seek a better life in Malaysia. Officials say many of those fleeing would have paid more than $3,000 (£2,300) for passage.",

    "body": "3 hours agoAmy WalkerSir Richard Knighton: \"We don't yet know... the source of those drones\"Britain is providing military support to Belgium after a series of suspected Russian drone incursions into its airspace, the new chief of the defence staff has said.Sir Richard Knighton told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that his Belgian counterpart had asked for assistance earlier this week and that equipment and personnel were now on the way.Brussels Airport was forced to close temporarily on Thursday night after drones were spotted nearby. They were also seen in other locations, including a military base.It follows a series of drone incursion over several Nato nations that disrupted air travel. Russia has denied accusations of conducting \"hybrid warfare\" on allies of Ukraine.Sir Richard said it was not known for sure if the incursions were by Russia, but that it was \"plausible\" they had been ordered by Moscow.Defence Secretary John Healey said in a statement: \"As hybrid threats grow, our strength lies in our alliances and our collective resolve to defend, deter and protect our critical infrastructure and airspace\".Members of the RAF's 2 Force Protection Wing are likely to be deployed, the BBC understands.Alongside Nato allies, Sir Richard added that the UK would help Belgium \"by providing our kit and capability\". The German defence ministry said on Friday that it too would support Belgium with anti-drone measures after a request from Brussels.About 3,000 Brussels Airlines passengers were affected by Thursday's disruption, with the carrier saying it faced \"considerable costs\" from cancelling or diverting dozens of flights.German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius and the Belgian security services have said they suspect Russia of being behind the incursion, but Belgian Defence Minister Theo Francken previously indicated there was no evidence to suggest this.\"At first, drones flying over our military bases were seen as our problem,\" Francken said earlier this week.\"Now it has become a serious threat affecting civilian infrastructure across multiple European countries.\"Instagram/Royal Air Force RegimentThe RAF's 2 Force Protection Wing was deployed in an anti-drone role to the Paris Olympics in 2024Sir Richard said Russia was, broadly speaking, \"the most pressing threat right now\" to Europe. \"The illegal invasion of Ukraine has shown the barbaric nature of Russia's war efforts.\"He added that sabotage and killings had been carried out by Russia on UK soil, and that so-called hybrid warfare was an area in which \"we [the UK] need to strengthen ourselves\".Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and currently controls around a fifth of its territory, including the Crimean peninsula that it annexed in 2014.Hybrid threats use a mix of military and non-military tactics and are designed to interfere with infrastructure or institutions, according to Nato. The shadow defence secretary welcomed the decision to assist Belgium, saying there was \"a heightened threat environment\" and that a key part of deterring threats was \"by acting with other countries through Nato\". But James Cartlidge also criticised the government's approach to increasing defence spending, saying more urgency was needed.In spring, the government announced defence spending would rise to 2.5% of GDP from April 2027, with an ambition to reach 3% in the next parliament. Sir Richard said the funding was \"more than I've ever known in my career\".The incursion into Belgian airspace follows similar incursions across European nations including Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Germany. All are Nato allies that have provided support to Ukraine.While some have pointed the finger at Russia, officials have not produced evidence linking the incursions to Moscow, while the Kremlin has consistently denied any involvement.Suspicions have been fuelled by more overt airspace incursions by Russia in Eastern Europe in recent months, involving fighter jets and larger attack drones. Mocow has denied these were intentional.The UK has recently sent RAF Typhoon jets to take part in defence missions over Poland as part of Nato's mission to bolster the eastern flank in response to incursions.Pistorious has suggested the latest sightings could be linked to EU-wide discussions to use frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine in the form of a €140bn loan.",

    "body": "Syrian President Ahmed Sharaa has arrived in Washington for an official visit, just two days after the US formally revoked his status as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. The former Islamist militant will meet US President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, 11 months after his rebel alliance ousted Bashar al-Assad.Hours before his arrival in the US capital it was announced that Syrian security services had detained dozens of suspected members of the so-called Islamic State group.Joint efforts to tackle what remains of the group in Syria are expected to be high on the agenda during Sharaa's talks with Trump.Syrian authorities said 71 suspected members of the group were arrested, with weapons and explosives also seized.Since taking power, Sharaa has looked to reestablish Syria's presence on the world stage after decades of isolation under the Assad regime and 13 years of civil war.He travelled to the US in September to address the UN General Assembly, where he said Syria was \"reclaiming its rightful place among the nations of the world\" and called on the international community to remove sanctions.Earlier this week the UN Security Council backed a US resolution to lift measures, which coincided with Washington continuing a months-long process of gradually easing sanctions on Syria and its new leaders.On Friday, Sharaa and his interior minister, Anas Hasan Khattab, were removed from a US register of individuals suspected of supporting or funding extremist groups, a decision the Treasury Department said was \"in recognition of the progress demonstrated by the Syrian leadership\".Sharaa had been listed under the name Muhammad al-Jawlani, the alias he used as leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The group was affiliated with al-Qaeda until 2016, when Sharaa severed ties.Prior to leading HTS, Sharaa fought for al-Qaeda in Iraq and was for a time imprisoned by US forces. He was also subject to an American bounty of $10 million.The US lifted its sanctions on HTS earlier this year.Trump previously met Sharaa in May during a visit to Riyadh, where he described him as a \"tough guy, very strong past\".Despite his background, Sharaa has drawn backing from governments that opposed the Assad regime by vowing to lead a moderate government which can win support from Syria's various ethnic groups and factions.Earlier this year, he vowed to root out elements of his security forces which were accused of executing members of Syria's Alawite minority. Deadly violence has also broken out in recent months between Sunni Bedouin tribal fighters and Druze militias, raising questions over whether the HTS-led government can restore stability to a country defined by war for more than a decade.

    "body": "18 hours agoCBSMaria Florinda Rios Perez was fatally shot after arriving at the wrong home for a house-cleaning appointment US officials are looking into whether to file charges against an Indiana homeowner who shot and killed a house cleaner who mistakenly showed up at the wrong address.Police say they found Maria Florinda Rios Perez dead in her husband's arms on the front porch of a home on Wednesday shortly before 0700 local time (12:00 GMT). Authorities had been responding to a call about a possible home invasion in the Indianapolis suburb of Whitestown. The two did not appear to have entered the home, police said in a statement. They have formally submitted the case to the Boone County Prosecutor's Office for review to determine whether criminal charges will be brought in the case. Police have not identified the people in the home or who fired the shot, saying in a statement on Friday that it is a \"complex, delicate, and evolving case, and it would be both inappropriate and potentially dangerous to disclose that information\". They urged patience, warning of a \"concerning spread of misinformation online\" about the case.Mauricio Velazquez, told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that he wanted justice for his 32-year-old wife. News reports say that she was a mother of four and originally from Guatemala. In an interview with CBS affiliate WTTV, Mr Velazquez said the bullet came right through the door of the home. \"They should've called the police first instead of just shooting out of nowhere like that,\" he said through an interpreter.CBSMauricio Velazquez said the bullet that killed his wife came through the door of the home they went to early on WednesdayBoone County prosecutor Kent Eastwood told The Indianapolis Star that the case is complex due to the language of the state's stand-your-ground law.Stand-your-ground laws are in place in many US states and most permit an individual to protect themselves with the use of reasonable force, including deadly force, to prevent death or great bodily harm.Similar incidents have made headlines across the US in recent years. In 2023, Ralph Yarl, who was then 16, was shot twice after ringing the doorbell of the wrong home in Missouri. Andrew Lester, who was in his 80s, pleaded guilty and died while awaiting sentencing. In New York, 20-year-old Kaylin Gillis died after being shot upon entering the wrong driveway. The homeowner who shot her is now serving a 25-year sentence. ",

    "body": "13 hours agoOttilie Mitchell and Harry SekulichUS aviation authorities have ordered that all models of a cargo plane that crashed mid-takeoff in Kentucky on Tuesday be grounded.It comes after a Boeing MD-11 aircraft operated by UPS burst into flames on the runway of Louisville International Airport before colliding into neighbouring businesses, killing 14 people. The American delivery firm had earlier said it would not operate the planes pending an ongoing investigation, with FedEx then following suit.Now the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a formal notice banning all MD-11 and MD11F aircraft from flying until safety checks are carried out.In total, 70 models are in use with UPS, FedEx and Western Global Airlines.FAA officials said the Kentucky crash happened after the plane's left engine caught fire and detached from the wing during take-off. The aircraft was carrying 38,000 gallons (144,000 litres) of fuel as it took off for a flight to Hawaii, which contributed to the size of the fire after the crash.A total of 14 people were killed in the crash and subsequent fire, including one person who had been admitted to hospital, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg has said.He said the number of dead now matches the number of people who were reported missing, indicating officials do not expect the death toll to climb further.Boeing said it welcomed the directive and that it had already advised the three firms which use the model to stop operating it out of \"an abundance of caution\".It is unclear whether the order will impact delivery services in the US, with none of the three companies reporting disruption so far.Data collated by the live air traffic website FlightRadar24 showed 55 MD-11 planes were used over the past week. \"Contingency plans are in place to flex our integrated air and ground network to help protect time-sensitive, critical shipments such as lifesaving pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and other products move through our network without disruption,\" FedEx said in a statement.UPS also said contingency plans were in place to continue its service. A statement continued: \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.\"The final passenger flights using an MD-11 was in 2014, with the model used exclusively as a cargo carrier since.The model of aircraft involved in the crash was an MD-11F triple-engine plane, which first entered service 34 years ago with Thai Airways as a passenger jet, but was transferred to UPS in 2006.MD-11s were originally manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, before the company merged with Boeing in 1997. Production of MD-11 planes ended in 2000.",

    "body": "15 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinGetty ImagesTravellers wait in a long line at a security checkpoint at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport on 6 NovemberMore than 1,400 flights to, from, or within the US were cancelled on Saturday after airlines were told this week to cut traffic during the federal government shutdown.Nearly 6,000 flights were also delayed, down from over 7,000 delays on Friday, according to flight tracker FlightAware. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced earlier in the week that it would be reducing air travel capacity by up to10% at 40 of the nation's busiest airports as air traffic controllers, who are working without pay during the shutdown,  report fatigue.Republicans and Democrats remain divided over how to end the impasse in Congress as the shutdown, which began 1 October, continues. Saturday marked the 39th day of the longest shutdown in history as Republicans and Democrats still have not agreed on a funding resolution to reopen the government.  Senators are in Washington over the weekend for bipartisan negotitations aimed at ending the shutdown, which is beginning to be felt by more and more Americans amid cuts to food aid payments and the flight disruptions. In a statement on Saturday, American Airlines urged \"leaders in Washington, D.C., to reach an immediate resolution to end the shutdown\".New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport was experiencing some of the longest wait times. As of Saturday afternoon, arrivals to the airport were delayed by an average of more than four hours, while departures from the airport were delayed by an average of 1.5 hours, according to the FAA. The airports with the most cancelled flights on Saturday, both to and from the location, were Charlotte/Douglas International, Newark Liberty International, and Chicago O'Hare International, according to FlightAware. Departures to John F Kennedy International, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, and La Guardia were delayed by nearly three hours, over 2.5 hours, and about an hour, respectively, the FAA reported as of Saturday afternoon.With the Thanksgiving holiday approaching on 27 November, it's one of the busiest travel seasons of the year in the US. It's not just commercial flights that have been affected. Restrictions on private jets are also in place, Secretary Duffy said in a Saturday post on X.  \"We've reduced their volume at high traffic airports — instead having private jets utilize smaller airports or airfields so busy controllers can focus on commercial aviation,\" Duffy wrote. \"That's only fair.\"And things will likely get worse in the coming days as the FAA increases the percentage of cancelled flights. On Thursday, the agency announced that the flight reductions would be gradual, starting at 4% of  flights on Friday before rising to 6% by 11 November, 8% by 13 November, and the full 10% by 14 November.The FAA said the cuts were necessary to maintain safety as air traffic controllers have been overworked during the shutdown. As essential workers, the controllers are required to continue working without pay, and as a result, many have called out sick or taken on second jobs to afford necessities, unions say. Watch: \"Devastating\" - Airline travellers react to flight reductionsThe controllers are just some of the 1.4 million federal workers who have either been working without pay or been put on forced during the shutdown.Another factor impacting air travel is that most of the Transportation Security Agency (TSA) 64,000 agents are also not being paid while the shutdown is in place.During the previous government shutdown, under US President Donald Trump in 2018, it was found that up to 10% of TSA staff chose to stay at home rather than work for free.",

    "body": "24 hours agoJames Landale,Diplomatic correspondent in Kyiv and Alex KleidermanAt least six people have died after Russia launched hundreds of missile and drone attacks on energy infrastructure and residential targets in Ukraine overnight.A strike on an apartment building in the city of Dnipro killed two people and wounded 12, while three died in Zaporizhzhia. In all, 25 locations across Ukraine, including the capital city Kyiv, were hit, leaving many areas without electricity and heating. Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on Telegram that major energy facilities were damaged in the Poltava, Kharkiv and Kyiv regions, and work was under way to restore power. In Russia, the defence ministry said its forces had shot down 79 Ukrainian drones overnight.The Ukrainian air force said Russia had launched more than 450 exploding bomber drones and 45 missiles. Nine missiles and 406 drones were reportedly shot down.The Ukrainian Energy Ministry said there were power cuts in the Dnipropetrovsk, Chernihiv, Zaporizhzhya, Odesa and Kirovohrad regions, but restoration work was ongoing.Svyrydenko said critical infrastructure facilities have already been reconnected, and water supply is being maintained using generators. Russia argues its attacks on energy targets are aimed at the Ukrainian military.Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure ahead of winter are now a familiar part of this war. But ministers in Kyiv are acutely concerned that Moscow is not just trying to damage the morale of Ukraine's people but also bring its economy to a standstill by collapsing its energy network. Analysts say this fourth winter of Russia's full scale invasion will prove a significant test of Ukraine's defensive resilience.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the attacks showed there must be \"no exceptions\" to Western sanctions on Russian energy as a way of putting pressure on Moscow. The missile strikes came only hours after the US gave Hungary a one-year exemption from restrictions on buying oil and gas from Russia. In October, the US effectively blacklisted two of Russia's largest oil companies, threatening sanctions on those who buy from them. But on Friday, during a visit to Washington by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban - a close personal and political ally of Donald Trump - the US president  announced the exemption for Budapest.In a message on Telegram, Zelensky said the overnight attacks showed that \"pressure must be intensified\" on Russia.He said \"for every Moscow strike on energy infrastructure - aimed at harming ordinary people before winter - there must be a sanctions response targeting all Russian energy, with no exceptions\".He said Ukraine expected \"relevant decisions from the US, Europe and the G7\".Debates about sanctions can sometimes seem technical or diplomatic. But for people in Ukraine, they are very real. If Russia can sell its oil to Hungary, it can use the money earned to build more drones and missiles, like those it launched against Ukraine on Friday night.",

    "body": "4 hours agoTiffany Wertheimer and Damian ZaneEPANicholas Oyoo (L) and Bob Njagi (R) were greeted by supporters when they arrived back in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, on SaturdayUgandan President Yoweri Museveni has for the first time acknowledged that two Kenyan activists who were missing in his country for five weeks had been arrested.Last month, eyewitnesses reported seeing Bob Njagi and Nicholas Oyoo being forced into a car by masked uniformed men after a political event where they were supporting Ugandan opposition leader Bobi Wine.News of their release was confirmed on Saturday but up to that point the authorities had denied that they were being detained.In a live interview on Saturday evening, Museveni described the two men as \"experts in riots\" who had then been put \"in the fridge for some days\".The president, who has been in power for almost four decades and is running for another term in office, was responding to a question about the recent deadly youth-led protests in neighbouring Tanzania.Museveni blamed foreign groups for stoking up trouble and said \"the ones who are doing that game here in Uganda will end up badly\".Without naming them, he added that the two Kenyan activists were released after he received calls from \"some Kenyan leaders\" who said they should be handed back. Mr Njagi and Mr Oyoo were welcomed by supporters at the main airport in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, on Saturday.\"Thirty-eight days of abduction was not easy. We didn't think that we were going to come out alive because we were being abducted by the military,\" Mr Njagi said. Kenya's Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi said their release followed \"sustained diplomatic engagement between Kenya and Uganda\".Activist organisation Vocal Africa, who had been campaigning for the two men to be freed said: \"Let this moment signal an important shift towards upholding the human rights of East Africans anywhere in East African Community\".In a joint statement, Vocal Africa, the Law Society of Kenya and Amnesty International thanked the Kenyan and Ugandan governments, as well as \"all active citizens\" who had campaigned for the release.Former pop star Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, is running against Museveni for the presidency in next year's elections.Bobi Wine accused the Ugandan government of targeting the two Kenyans for associating with him. \"If they committed any offence, why were they not produced before court and formally charged?\" he asked in a post on X on Sunday.Ugandan security agencies have often been accused of orchestrating the detention of opposition politicians and supporters while not in uniform. Some of those arrested have later resurfaced in court facing criminal charges.The latest disappearances mirror past incidents involving politicians and activists across the East African region.Last year, Njagi was picked up in Kenya by masked men during a wave of abductions believed to have been targeting government critics in the country.He surfaced a month later, after a court ordered police to produce him. He later recounted the harrowing conditions in captivity, where he said he was often isolated and denied food.Earlier this year, Kenyan activist Boniface Mwangi and his Ugandan counterpart Agather Atuhaire were detained in Tanzania and held incommunicado for days before being abandoned at their respective national borders.They later recounted being brutally mistreated, including sexual torture at the hands of the Tanzanian authorities – allegations which police dismissed as \"hearsay\".Last year, another Uganda opposition figure, Kizza Besigye, mysteriously disappeared in Nairobi only to surface four days later in a military court in Uganda, where he faces treason charges.The cases have since sparked widespread condemnation and concerns that East African governments could be collaborating to contain dissent.You may also be interested in:How a Ugandan opposition leader disappeared in Kenya and ended up in military court'We live in fear' - forced expulsions taint Kenya's safe haven imageUganda's Yoweri Museveni: How an ex-rebel has stayed in power for 35 yearsBobi Wine: Uganda's 'ghetto president'Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "24 hours agoNick ThorpeBudapest, HungaryOn the surface, the Hungarian prime minister's trip was exactly what he went to Washington for: luxuriant praise and an exemption from sanctions on Russian oil, gas and nuclear supplies.And all that just five months out from a difficult election.Look closer, however, and the picture is less clear cut. The US side struck a hard trade deal - and an expensive one for Hungary. And there's no progress on Viktor Orban's biggest headache: ending the war in neighbouring Ukraine, and with it the long shadow the conflict casts over Hungary.Let's look first at Orban's key win - an exemption from US sanctions, which a White House official told the BBC was time-limited to one year, although Péter Szijjártó, Hungary's foreign minister, said would be indefinite.The time span is interesting. Trump clearly wants to help his friend win the election in April. And the exemption even partially dovetails with the European Commission demand to all member states to end the import of Russian oil, gas and nuclear fuel by the end of 2027. What is missing, from an EU perspective, is any political commitment from Orban to meet that demand - a commitment made and fulfilled by the Czech government. And the EU is trying to tighten energy sanctions - to the fury of Hungary and Slovakia.Away from the media spotlight, the Hungarian energy company MOL has been upgrading two of its refineries - Százhalombatta in Hungary and the Slovnaft facility in Bratislava - to process Brent crude instead of the high-sulphur Urals crude which flows through Russian pipelines. On Friday, MOL said 80% of its oil needs could be imported through the Adria pipeline from Croatia, albeit with higher logistical costs and technical risks. So Orban's argument, which so impressed Trump, that Hungary, as a landlocked country, has no alternative to Russian oil may not strictly be true. Overall, Hungary and Slovakia have together paid Russia $13bn (£10bn) for its oil between its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the end of 2024. The one-year window granted by the US is nevertheless a valuable respite for Hungarian households this winter. Orban told pro-government reporters who travelled with him to Washington that otherwise utility bills \"could have gone up by up to three times in December\". Capping those bills by various means has been a central plank of his popularity in Hungary since 2013. Under the US exemption, Hungary can also continue to buy Russian gas through the Turkstream pipeline, which traverses the Balkans, and pay for it in hard currency ($185m in August alone) using a Bulgarian loophole. Orban has agreed to buy LNG from the US worth $600 million, according to Bloomberg.Another key part of the Washington deal is nuclear. Hungary agreed to buy US nuclear fuel rods for its Paks 1 nuclear power station (at a cost of $114m), in parallel to those bought from Russia's Rosatom and France's Framatome.Russian plans to finance and build the nuclear extension, called Paks 2, have been long delayed by technical and licensing issues. The US agreement to lift all nuclear sanctions on Hungary may help restart that project, but thorny problems remain. Hungary has also agreed to buy US technology to extend the short-term storage of spent nuclear fuel at Paks for between $100m and $200m.Perhaps the biggest part of the deal was a Hungarian commitment to buy up to 10 small modular nuclear reactors from the US, for somewhere between $10bn and $20bn. Hungary needs electricity to power the huge Chinese battery plants being built around the country. Smaller nuclear plants are less plagued by building delays, and are easier to licence.Finally, a currency swap deal - similar to a recent US-Argentina deal to prop up the peso - under which US and Hungarian central banks can exchange currency is being discussed.This would mean that in a future financial crisis in Hungary, the US central bank could feed dollars to Budapest, which boosts financial security in Hungary.So in summary, Hungary struck a deal to buy US gas, nuclear energy and unspecified weapons systems in exchange for a temporary waiver from US sanctions on Russian oil and gas. But it failed to get the re-introduction of the US-Hungary dual taxation system, abolished in 2022, which harms mutual trade. And it did not get a new date for a potential Trump-Putin summit in Budapest as part of efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war.Critics say energy dependence on Russia is being replaced by energy dependence on the US.

    "body": "2 days agoSteve Mellen and Alys DaviesA former British soldier is facing extradition to Kenya in connection with the alleged murder of a 21-year-old woman there in 2012.The National Crime Agency (NCA) said Robert James Purkiss was arrested in Tidworth, Wiltshire on 6 November and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday.He was arrested by specialist officers from the NCA's National Extradition Unit in connection with the killing of Agnes Wanjiru after a warrant was issued in September, the agency added.Mr Purkiss, 38, told the court he intended to contest the extradition and was remanded into custody ahead of his next appearance at the same court on 14 November.His lawyers told the court that he \"vehemently denies\" murder.Ms Wanjiru's body was discovered in a septic tank near a hotel in the town of Nanyuki, about 124 miles (200km) north of Nairobi, three months after she had gone missing on 31 March 2012. She had a five-month-old baby at the time.Her body was found near a British army training camp. On the night she was killed, she had reportedly been at a bar with friends where British soldiers were also present. Ms Wanjiru's niece, Esther Njoki, met the UK's defence minister last month in order to push for Mr Purkiss's extradition. In a statement issued through Leigh Day, the lawyers acting for Ms Wanjiru's family, on Friday Ms Njoki said: \"My family is incredibly relieved to hear that the suspect in my aunt's case has been arrested.\"We have waited so many years for this moment which marks an important step towards finally obtaining justice for our beloved Agnes.\"Leigh Day partner Tessa Gregory said: \"This is a huge moment for our client and her family who have been fighting for over a decade to obtain justice for Agnes.\"We hope the UK and Kenyan authorities will now work together to ensure that the suspect can face trial in Kenya as quickly as possible.\"Ms Wanjiru's family has long accused the British army of covering up her death and the Kenyan authorities of failing to properly investigate the case at the time.An inquest into her death was opened in 2018 following pressure from Ms Wanjiru's family, as well as Kenyan rights groups and feminists.In 2019, it concluded that Ms Wanjiru had been unlawfully killed by one or two British soldiers and that she had suffered stab wounds to the chest and abdomen.Later in 2021, a Sunday Times investigation reported that a British soldier had confessed to colleagues that he killed Ms Wanjiru. The soldier left the army after the incident and reportedly continued to live in the UK.In 2024, the army announced it was launching an internal review into the conduct of British soldiers in Kenya, including in Nanyuki.It found 35 suspected cases of soldiers having engaged in sexual exploitation and abuse, including transactional sex, with local women - nine of these being after the army officially banned such conduct in 2022.",

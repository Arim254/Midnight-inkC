    "body": "Dutch volleyball player and convicted child rapist denied visa to compete in Australia2 hours agoLana LamSydneyReutersSteven van de Velde was due to compete in Adelaide next monthA Dutch Olympic volleyball player convicted of raping a British girl a decade ago has been denied a visa to compete in Australia.Steven van de Velde, 31, was due to play at the Beach Volleyball World Championships in Adelaide, South Australia, next month.In 2016, the then 21-year-old pleaded guilty to three counts of raping a 12-year-old girl in Milton Keynes and was sentenced to four years in jail. He had met the girl on Facebook and travelled to England from Amsterdam before raping her in her home in 2014.Two weeks ago, South Australia's Attorney-General Kyam Maher wrote to the federal government, calling on authorities to reject his visa as his crimes were \"utterly abhorrent\".The letter also said \"we do not believe that foreign child sex offenders should be granted entry to this country\".Australia's Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the government will \"continue to use every tool we have available to ensure that Australians can be safe and feel safe in their communities\".After the rape in 2014, Van de Velde returned to the Netherlands but in 2016, he was extradited to the UK and arrested. Ahead of his sentencing, the court heard he was aware of the girl's age.He served 12 months of his four-year sentence and restarted his professional sporting career in 2018, playing for his national team in several global tournaments.Last year, he represented the Netherlands at the Paris Olympics and was booed by some people in the crowd. Earlier, an online petition calling for him to be banned from the Olympics had attracted 90,000 signatures.The BBC has contacted the organisers of the world championship event in South Australia and the Dutch national volleyball association for comment.

    "body": "4 hours agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology Correspondent, San FranciscoOpenAI has released new estimates of the number of ChatGPT users who exhibit possible signs of mental health emergencies, including mania, psychosis or suicidal thoughts.The company said that around 0.07% of ChatGPT users active in a given week exhibited such signs, adding that its artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot recognizes and responds to these sensitive conversations.While OpenAI maintains these cases are \"extremely rare,\" critics said even a small percentage may amount to hundreds of thousands of people, as ChatGPT recently reached 800 million weekly active users, per boss Sam Altman.As scrutiny mounts, the company said it built a network of experts around the world to advise it.Those experts include more than 170 psychiatrists, psychologists, and primary care physicians who have practiced in 60 countries, the company said.They have devised a series of responses in ChatGPT to encourage users to seek help in the real world, according to OpenAI.But the glimpse at the company's data raised eyebrows among some mental health professionals.\"Even though 0.07% sounds like a small percentage, at a population level with hundreds of millions of users, that actually can be quite a few people,\" said Dr. Jason Nagata, a professor who studies technology use among young adults at the University of California, San Francisco.\"AI can broaden access to mental health support, and in some ways support mental health, but we have to be aware of the limitations,\" Dr. Nagata added.The company also estimates 0.15% of ChatGPT users have conversations that include \"explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.\"OpenAI said recent updates to its chatbot are designed to \"respond safely and empathetically to potential signs of delusion or mania\" and note \"indirect signals of potential self-harm or suicide risk.\"ChatGPT has also been trained to reroute sensitive conversations \"originating from other models to safer models\" by opening in a new window.In response to questions by the BBC on criticism about the numbers of people potentially affected, OpenAI said that this small percentage of users amounts to a meaningful amount of people and noted they are taking changes seriously. The changes come as OpenAI faces mounting legal scrutiny over the way ChatGPT interacts with users.In one of the most high-profile lawsuits recently filed against OpenAI, a California couple sued the company over the death of their teenage son alleging that ChatGPT encouraged him to take his own life in April.The lawsuit was filed by the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine and was the first legal action accusing OpenAI of wrongful death.In a separate case, the suspect in a murder-suicide that took place in August in Greenwich, Connecticut posted hours of his conversations with ChatGPT, which appear to have fuelled the alleged perpetrator's delusions.More users struggle with AI psychosis as \"chatbots create the illusion of reality,\" said Professor Robin Feldman, Director of the AI Law & Innovation Institute at the University of California Law. \"It is a powerful illusion.\"She said OpenAI deserved credit for \"sharing statistics and for efforts to improve the problem\" but added: \"the company can put all kinds of warnings on the screen but a person who is mentally at risk may not be able to heed those warnings.\" ",

    "body": "Two people have been killed after an underground explosion at a mine in the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW).Emergency services were called to the Endeavor mine at Cobar, about 700km (435 miles) northwest of Sydney, in the early hours of Tuesday after reports that two people had been critically injured.Police said a man, in his 60s, was confirmed dead at the scene and two women, both in their 20s, were brought to the surface, but one later died. The second woman was airlifted to hospital for minor injuries including hearing damage and shock.A report will be prepared for the coroner and an investigation into the incident will be carried out by the state's workplace safety authority.Cobar Mayor Jarrod Marsden said it was an \"absolutely tragic\" situation, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).\"The most valuable thing to come out of a mine are the miners, and two families don't get to see their loved ones anymore,\" he told the ABC.\"Cobar is a small mining community, it's very tight-knit, and I'm sure everyone's going to be thinking of their families today.\"According to the Endeavor mine's website, the mine had been operating continuously from 1982 to 2020.It was bought by Polymetals Resources in 2023 and the company was in the process of restarting mining activities for silver, zinc and lead metal production this year. The mine includes a 7km (4.3 miles) decline and 300m shaft, the site said.NSW Premier Chris Minns extended his condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of the workers who died.\"This is a heartbreaking day for the Cobar community and will be felt across the entire mining industry,\" he said. Safety protocols and procedures have \"greatly improved in mining\", Minns said, but the two deaths were a \"sobering reminder of why we need to always remain vigilant to protect workers\".",

    "body": "Israel has received, through the Red Cross, a coffin that Hamas says contains the body of another deceased hostage held in Gaza.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had taken the coffin from Gaza back to Israel, where forensic tests would be used to identify the remains.If they are confirmed as belonging to a hostage, Hamas will have returned 16 of the 28 dead Israelis and foreigners it was holding before the start of a ceasefire two weeks ago.The latest handover came after the Israeli government said it had allowed a member of Hamas into territory inside Gaza controlled by the IDF to help Red Cross and Egyptian personnel search for the remaining dead hostages.Israel accuses Hamas of violating the ceasefire agreement brokered by the US, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey because it has not returned all of the hostages' bodies.The Palestinian armed group says it is committed to the deal, but that it needs help to find remains buried under the rubble left by two years of war.\"The Red Cross, the Egyptian technical team, and a Hamas person have been permitted to enter beyond the IDF's Yellow Line position in Gaza under close IDF supervision,\" Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian told a briefing on Monday afternoon.She also said the Egyptians would bring in more equipment, including \"tractor-type vehicles\".On Sunday, she had said they were using two to three excavators and a similar number of lorries to carry out searches.All 20 living Israeli hostages were released soon after the ceasefire took effect on 10 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel had also handed over the bodies of 195 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 13 Israeli hostages previously returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Before Monday night's handover, 11 of the dead hostages still in Gaza were Israelis, one was Tanzanian, and one was Thai.\"Hamas knows where they are located and there is no other option but for them to be released back home,\" Ms Bedrosian said.Earlier, the group representing the Israeli hostages' families demanded that immediate action be taken to ensure Hamas handed over all the bodies. This includes delaying the second phase of US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan.\"The families urge the government of Israel, the United States administration, and the mediators not to advance to the next phase of the agreement until Hamas fulfils all of its obligations,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said.It came after Israeli media cited an Israeli security official as saying that the Trump administration wanted to move to the second phase even if not all the hostages were found.On Saturday, Hamas's chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya said in a statement that the group was facing \"challenges\" because Israeli forces had \"altered the terrain of Gaza\".\"Moreover, some of those who buried the bodies have been martyred or no longer remember where they buried them,\" he added.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,500 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "Ten people accused of sexist cyber-bullying of the French president's wife, Brigitte Macron, are due to go on trial this week in Paris.The defendants are accused of spreading unsubstantiated claims over her gender and sexuality, as well as making \"malicious remarks\" about the 24-year age gap between Brigitte and her husband, Emmanuel Macron.If found guilty, the defendants face up to two years' imprisonment.Among the ten people due to appear in the dock on Monday and Tuesday are an elected official, a gallery owner and a teacher, according to French media.Two of them - self-styled independent journalist Natacha Rey and internet fortune-teller Amandine Roy – were found guilty of slander last year for claiming that France's first lady had never existed, and that her brother Jean-Michel Trogneux had changed gender and started using her name.But a court of appeals later acquitted Rey and Roy on the grounds that their statements did not constitute defamation. Mrs Macron and her brother are appealing the decision.A conspiracy theory centred around the notion that Brigitte Macron is a transgender woman has been swirling since her husband won a first term in office in 2017.The unsubstantiated claims over Mrs Macron's gender have been gaining ground in the US, mostly promoted by right-wing influencer Candace Owens.Last July the Macrons filed a lawsuit against Owens, alleging that she \"disregarded all credible evidence disproving her claim in favour of platforming known conspiracy theorists and proven defamers\".Speaking to the BBC's Fame Under Fire podcast, the Macrons' lawyer in the case, Tom Clare, said that Brigitte Macron had found the claims \"incredibly upsetting\" and they were a \"distraction\" to the French president.\"It is incredibly upsetting to think that you have to go and subject yourself, to put this type of proof forward,\" he said.Emmanuel Macron has said pursuing legal action against Owens was about \"defending his honour\" and that the influencer had peddled false information \"with the aim of causing harm, in the service of an ideology and with established connections to far-right leaders.\"Mrs Macron first met her now-husband when she was a teacher at his secondary school. The couple ended up marrying in 2007, when Mr Macron was 29 and Mrs Macron was 54.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump said he had an MRI scan during a recent visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. \"I did. I got an MRI. It was perfect,\" the president told reporters on board Air Force One on Monday on his way to a week-long trip in Asia. Trump, who at age 79 is one of the oldest presidents in US history, did not say why he got the scan, which can be used to check for a wide range of issues. The scan took place during Trump's visit to Walter Reed earlier this month, when his  physician said he was in \"exceptional health\".\"The doctor said [it] was some of the best reports, for the age, they've ever seen,\" Trump said Monday.Asked why he received the MRI, which stands for magnetic resonance imaging, Trump told reporters to \"ask the doctors\".Presidential physician Dr Sean Barbabella said in a statement at the time that Trump's appointment was a \"scheduled follow-up evaluation\" \"as part of his ongoing health maintenance plan and included advanced imaging, laboratory testing, and preventative health assessments\".The president \"continues to demonstrate excellent overall health\", Dr Barbabella said. MRI scans use strong magnetic fields to create an image of the inside of a patient's body, and is especially useful for looking at soft tissues, according to the US National Institutes of Health (NIH).Earlier this year, the White House announced that Trump had been diagnosed with a medical condition in his veins called chronic venous insufficiency.Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump had noticed swelling in his legs, prompting a check-up with his doctor who diagnosed him with the condition.Chronic venous insufficiency occurs when leg veins don't allow blood to flow back up to the heart, causing it to pool in the lower limbs. It is a \"benign and common\", in older individuals, according to a note from Barbabella.Trump had also been recently photographed with patches of makeup on the back of his hand. The White House has said it is unrelated to the vein condition but is instead bruising as a result of frequent handshaking.",

    "body": "11 hours agoMichael Shuval,BBC Arabic, Jerusalem and Jaroslav LukivThe father of a released Israeli hostage who was forced to dig his own grave in a Gazan tunnel by Hamas has told the BBC his son's health is \"improving every day\".Avishai David was speaking after his 24-year-old son Evyatar David and two other freed hostages - Guy Gilboa Dalal and Eitan Mor - were discharged from hospital to a hero's welcome at their homes on Sunday.\"I can't explain how happy it makes me feel to see him growing back to his old self,\" the father added.In August, two months before Evyatar's release, Hamas had posted a video showing him emaciated in a narrow concrete tunnel - a move that drew condemnation from Israel and many Western leaders.Avishai David told the BBC he was happy to see his son's \"vitality improving every day, his colour returning [to his face], his cheeks getting fuller\".\"Thank God, he pulled through it and he's strong.\"The father said he had suffered for months knowing that his son was only \"80km away... and I can't help him\".\"It devastated me,\" he said, adding that he \"couldn't sleep, eat, drink properly.\"In August, Evyatar's brother Ilay told the BBC the Hamas video was a \"new form of cruelty\".\"He's a human skeleton. He was being starved to the point where he can be dead at any moment, and he suffers a great deal,\" Ilay said at the time.In the footage itself, Evyatar said: \"I haven't eaten for days... I barely got drinking water.\" He was seen digging what he said would be his own grave.On Sunday, cheering crowds - including many friends and neighbours - greeted Evyatar David as he returned to his hometown of Kfar Saba in central Israel. Dr Michal Shteinman, director at Rabin Medical Centre where the three released hostages were treated, told the BBC their bodies still bore the marks of \"this horrific captivity\".\"We can see their blood tests... and we've also heard their stories... they are not lying. You can see the marks of this metabolic trauma. Their skin tells their story. You can see the scars and the wounds.\"But Dr Shteinman added that the hostages \"came back stronger than they were\".Evyatar was abducted from the Nova music festival during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023.He and 19 other living hostages have been released by Hamas under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal earlier this month.Hamas has also transferred 15 out of 28 deceased hostages. Thirteen were Israelis, one was Nepalese and the other Thai.In exchange, Israel has freed 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza, and returned 15 bodies of Palestinians for every Israeli hostage's remains.The IDF launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.More than 68,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.",

    "body": "4 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseUS President Donald Trump has not ruled out the possibility of seeking a third term for the White House, saying he would \"love to do it\". But Trump rejected the possibility of running for vice-president in 2028 - an idea floated by some supporters as a way for him to circumvent the US constitution that bars the president from running for a third term.Speaking to reporters during his trip to Asia, Trump described the idea as \"too cute\" and said it \"wouldn't be right\". It is unclear what method he would use to run again. Last week, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon said that a \"plan\" was in place to secure the 79-year-old president another term. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Japan from Malaysia, Trump said that while he would \"be allowed\" to run again as vice-president, he had no plans to do so.\"I think people wouldn't like that,\" he said. \"It's too cute. It wouldn't be right.\" Talking about the possibility of a third term, Trump said: \"I haven't really thought about it. But I have the best poll numbers that I've ever had.\" Additionally, Trump also suggested vice-president JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as potential successors, calling them \"unstoppable\".\"All I can tell you is that we have a great group of people, which they don't,\" he added, referring to Democrats.Can Trump serve a third term as US president?The 22nd amendment of the US constitution bars presidents from seeking a third term. Repealing the amendment would require approval from two-thirds of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, or a constitutional convention called by  two-thirds of state legislatures - a process viewed as highly unlikely.The amendment would also need to have the backing of 38 states to ratify it, or making it officially valid.Last week, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon - who remains a vocal supporter - claimed there was a \"plan\" to secure a third term for Trump.\"Trump is going to be president in '28, and people ought to just get accommodated with that,\" Bannon told  The Economist. \"At the appropriate time, we'll lay out what the plan is.\" In March, Trump told CNBC he would \"probably not\" run again, though he later said  he was \"not joking\" about the possibility. It is still unclear which Democrats intend to run for the White House in 2028, although several have already expressed an interest. On Sunday, California Governor Gavin Newsom told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that  he would \"be lying\" if he said he was not giving serious thought to a presidential bid. Former vice-president Kamala Harris also told the BBC she may run again and that she could \"possibly\" be president in the future. ",

    "body": "4 hours agoCherylann Mollan, BBC News and Vishnukant Tiwari, BBC HindiBhopal, Madhya PradeshBBCAarish says he's worried about missing work after losing vision in his left eyeAarish, 15, sits on a hospital bed in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. A pair of dark glasses hides a painful injury in his left eye.His cornea was damaged a week ago when an improvised firecracker device that he bought to celebrate the Diwali festival exploded near his face, causing him to lose vision in one eye. He has undergone emergency surgery and his doctor says only time will tell how much sight he can regain.The teenager, who doesn't go to school, says he's most worried about missing work - his father works as a gardener and Aarish repairs televisions to supplement the family income. Child labour is illegal in India, but millions of children work. Indian law allows children above 14 years to work in some industries which are seen as non-hazardous.Aarish is among hundreds of children and young adults from at least five states across northern India who have suffered serious eye injuries from using the same kind of device - called \"carbide guns\" - during Diwali.The \"carbide gun\", a rudimentary device, using calcium carbide in a plastic pipe, gives dramatic results  - a loud blast that sounds like a gunshot, accompanied by fiery sparks. But the explosion is unpredictable and often delayed - officials told the BBC that many of the injuries occurred when children peeped inside the pipe to check just as the blast happened.The sale and purchase of calcium carbide is regulated in India, but farmers and shopkeepers often use it to artificially ripen fruit. Police officials also say the crude guns are sometimes used to scare away animals from fields.But many in India had not heard of these guns until last week, when a spate of injuries was reported after Diwali. Officials said these devices began flooding local markets in northern India after viral social media videos showed them being used as firecrackers.Karan, 14, went through surgery at Hamidia Hospital in BhopalMore than 100 cases of carbide gun-related eye injuries have been reported in Madhya Pradesh's Bhopal district alone, with at least 15 requiring surgery. Another 100 cases have been reported from three other districts. In Bihar state, 170 cases have been reported, with 40 requiring surgery, says Dr Bibhuti Prassan Sinha, who heads the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology in Patna city. The actual numbers are likely to be higher, he added.Cases have also been reported from the states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, as well as capital Delhi. Some states, including Madhya Pradesh, have now banned the use of carbide guns as firecrackers and several sellers have been arrested.Kavitha Kumar, head of ophthalmology at Hamidia Hospital in Bhopal, says that patients have been coming in with mild, moderate and severe eye injuries.\"In milder cases, skin on the eye and around it has sustained chemical injuries and thermal burns. In moderate cases, chemical particulate matter has caused mild damage to the cornea and in severe cases, there's extensive damage to the cornea, causing temporary vision loss. With surgery, the patient may be able to regain their sight over time,\" she says. Some doctors told the BBC that they were shocked by the severity of the injuries. Dr Aditi Dubey from Hamidia Hospital said that she had never seen chemical injuries caused by Diwali firecrackers and had to research what \"carbide guns\" were.Many patients said that they bought the gun after seeing it on Instagram Reels and YouTube videos. An attractive aspect was the price - at 150-200 rupees ($1.70-$2; £1.28-£1.70) a piece, it was a relatively cheap firecracker that promised to make a big impact.A search for the term \"carbide gun\" on Instagram and YouTube throws up dozens of videos of young people making and using these devices, often accompanied by rap music. Carbide guns began popping up in local markets in the weeks before DiwaliSome accounts have also termed these videos \"science experiments\" with hashtags like \"useful project\" and \"experiment video\".Dr Sinha told the BBC that one of his patients was an engineering student who made the gun at home after watching such videos. He's currently being treated after losing vision in one of his eyes.Calcium carbide is a regulated substance in India - its possession, use and manufacturing are controlled by law because of its harmful effects and potential for abuse.When it comes in contact with water, it produces acetylene gas, which is highly flammable and has damaging properties on health.Under the Calcium Carbide Rules, 1987, a licence is needed for its sale, purchase and storage - but only for quantities above 200kg.A government official in Bhopal who didn't want to be named told the BBC that calcium carbide is still widely used to artificially ripen fruit despite a federal ban as it contains traces of poisonous substances.Alzain and his mother, Afreen, at Hamidia HospitalHarinarayanachari Mishra, Police Commissioner of Bhopal, told the BBC that carbide guns are also used in northern India during wedding festivities and by farmers to drive away monkeys.Dr Partha Biswas, president of the All India Ophthalmological Society, says carbide guns should be banned urgently.\"It's a national problem. And the seriousness of these incidents shouldn't be minimised as mere \"accidents\" that took place during the Diwali festival,\" he says.He adds that there's potential for these guns to be used as firecrackers during other festivals and events, like when India wins a cricket match or during New Year.\"These crude 'carbide bombs' or 'carbide guns' can cause permanent blindness, disfigurement and disability,\" he says, demanding a nationwide crackdown on manufacturers and sellers of the guns as well as more control over the supply chain of calcium carbide.Back at Hamidia Hospital, Alzain, whose left eye was operated on after he lost his vision, sits inside the tight embrace of his mother. The seven-year-old had pestered his uncle to buy the gun after watching videos on YouTube. Alzain's worried mother, Afreen, hasn't left his bedside since he was admitted a week ago.\"I'm scared for his future,\" she says. \"I hope he's able to see again.\"",

    "body": "22 hours agoFergal KeaneSpecial correspondentWatch: Would Jordan provide security inside Gaza? The country's king explains his answer to BBC PanoramaCountries would reject being asked to \"enforce\" peace in Gaza if deployed under the Trump ceasefire plan, King Abdullah of Jordan has told the BBC.\"What is the mandate of security forces inside of Gaza? And we hope that it is peacekeeping, because if it's peace enforcing, nobody will want to touch that,\" said King Abdullah in an exclusive interview for BBC Panorama.\"Peacekeeping is that you're sitting there supporting the local police force, the Palestinians, which Jordan and Egypt are willing to train in large numbers, but that takes time. If we're running around Gaza on patrol with weapons, that's not a situation that any country would like to get involved in.\"The King's comments reflect concern from the US and other nations about being dragged into a continuing conflict between Hamas and Israel, or Hamas and other Palestinian groups. According to the UN, peace enforcement uses coercive measures including military force, while peacekeeping operates with the consent of the parties to a conflict and troops only use force in self-defence and defence of their mandate.Under US President Trump's 20-point peace plan, Arab states and international partners are to commit stabilisation forces that \"will train and provide support to vetted Palestinian police forces in Gaza, and will consult with Jordan and Egypt who have extensive experience in this field.\" Hamas is to disarm and give up political control of the territory.However Hamas has not yet disarmed and has mobilised thousands of fighters to reassert its grip on parts of the territory, Israel has carried out air strikes and other Palestinian armed groups are reportedly operating in parts of Gaza under Israeli control.King Abdullah said he would not send Jordanian forces into Gaza because his country was \"too close politically\" to the situation. More than half of Jordan's population is of Palestinian descent, and over decades, the country has taken in 2.3 million Palestinian refugees fleeing earlier wars with Israel - the largest number in the region.Asked if he trusted Hamas to keep its promise to give up any political role in Gaza, he replied: \"I don't know them, but those that are working extremely close to them - Qatar and Egypt - feel very, very optimistic that they will abide by that.\"If we don't solve this problem, if we don't find a future for Israelis and Palestinians and a relationship between the Arab and Muslim world and Israel, we're doomed.\"This year, 253 sick and wounded children, including Habiba - whose two arms and leg were amputated - have been evacuated from Gaza to JordanThe main mediation efforts during the war have been carried out by Qatar and Egypt working with the United States.The Jordanians have been part of an international effort trying to deliver aid to Gaza and evacuating sick and wounded children. The King has flown over the territory on three missions parachuting aid supplies.\"Looking over the back ramp was just shocking,\" he said. \"The devastation of that part of Gaza was just a shock to me.\"I've seen it myself, and how we, as the international community, are allowing this to happen is mind-boggling.\"The King asked for President Trump's support to evacuate 2,000 seriously ill Palestinian children from Gaza. In a White House meeting with the Jordanian monarch in February, Trump called it a \"beautiful gesture\".Since then, 253 children have been evacuated to Jordan. In all, more than 5,000 have been medically evacuated, most to Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. More than 15,000 Gazans are still awaiting evacuation, including about 3,000 children, according to the World Health Organization.To get children and their guardians out of the territory they must undergo a comprehensive security check by Israel and host countries. The World Health Organization has described the process as \"excruciatingly slow\". The Israeli military group which oversees aid for Gaza - Cogat - insists it places \"great importance\" on facilitating humanitarian aid to Gaza, including the evacuation of patients with \"complex medical conditions\". It stresses the necessity of security checks on individuals travelling through Israeli territory.Queen Rania praised President Trump for pressuring Israel and negotiating a ceasefireIn her interview for Panorama, Jordan's Queen Rania criticised the international community for, as she put it, failing to stop the war for two years.\"You know what it's like to be a parent over the last two years? To watch your children suffering, starving, shaking in terror, and to be powerless to do anything about it, and to know that the whole world is watching and not to do anything about it. That nightmare, it's the nightmare of any parent, but that nightmare has been the daily reality for Palestinians for the last two years.\"The Queen, who is of Palestinian descent, praised President Trump for his efforts to bring about the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. She said he had used America's diplomatic, military and financial support as leverage on Israel.\"To his credit, Trump was the first president in a long time to actually apply pressure on Israel. Beforehand, when they crossed lines, the US president would just maybe just say a few words of rebuke or they just get a slap on the wrist. President Trump actually got [Israeli PM Benjamin] Netanyahu to actually agree to a ceasefire. And I hope that he continues to be engaged in this process.\"Abdelrahman (r) was treated in Jordan after losing his left leg following an Israeli air strikeIsrael repeatedly accused Hamas of prolonging the war with its refusal to release Israeli hostages, and said the organisation - proscribed as a terror group by the UK, US and EU - used civilians as human shields in Gaza. According to the Hamas-run health ministry in the territory, more than 68,000 people have been killed since Israel invaded Gaza.Israel's invasion followed the 7 October attack by Hamas in which more than 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, were killed and 251 taken hostage into Gaza. Since then, arrest warrants for alleged war crimes have been issued by the International Criminal Court against Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant, as well as the military commander of Hamas, Mohammed Deif, although Hamas later confirmed he had been killed in an air strike.The signing of the Trump ceasefire agreement also saw the release of 20 living Israeli hostages from Gaza with continuing efforts to recover the remains of the dead. Israel released 250 Palestinian prisoners who had been convicted of crimes including murder and deadly attacks against Israelis, and about 1,700 detainees from Gaza who had been held by Israel without charge.When I asked Queen Rania if she believed a lasting peace was possible, she said hope for this was not naive, but a form of defiance.\"I truly believe that Palestinians and Israelis can exist side by side,\" she said. \"In the current atmosphere, there's too much animosity, too much anger and grief and hatred and cynicism between the two peoples to actually forge a peace on their own. I'm not being naive here. But I think with the push of the international community, that is the only way.\"So many times during the past two years, hope had felt elusive. Choosing hope was not easy… it's hard, it's heavy. But it's the only path that doesn't deny Palestinians or betray their struggle or our humanity.\"With additional reporting by Alice Doyard, Suha Kawar, David McIlveen and Liam Connell.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "16 minutes agoVanessa Buschschlüter and Jaroslav LukivWatch: Storm chasers fly inside the eye of Hurricane MelissaThree people have already died in Jamaica as it braces for the world's strongest storm this year - and possibly the strongest on record for the island - with US meteorologists warning of \"catastrophic and life-threatening\" conditions.With wind speeds of up to 175mph (282km/h), Hurricane Melissa is a category five storm - the maximum strength. It is intensifying and expected to make landfall on the Caribbean island early on Tuesday.It has been blamed for four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, in addition to the lives lost in Jamaica.Experts warn that Melissa's slow pace may mean prolonged torrential rain in some areas, increasing the risk of deadly flooding and landslides. The latest data from the US-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) shows that in terms of maximum wind and low central pressure, Melissa is the world's strongest storm so far this year.At its current strength, it would be the strongest hurricane to hit Jamaica since record-keeping began in 1851, CBS, the BBC's US news partner, reported. Tropical storm conditions are already occurring in Jamaica, and \"catastrophic and life-threatening hurricane-force wind conditions are expected to begin Tuesday morning,\" the latest NHC public advisory update said at 23:00 ET (03:00 GMT) on Monday.Watch: Satellite video shows Hurricane Melissa intensifying near JamaicaThree \"storm-related deaths\" were already reported in Jamaica Monday evening ahead of the hurricane's landfall, Jamaica's ministry of health and wellness said on X.The NHC said Melissa was currently about 140 miles (240km) south-west of the capital Kingston, with sustained winds of 175mph, (280km/h). It was moving \"north-northeast\" at 2mph (4 km/h). The update warned that within the eyewall - the inner part of the hurricane next to the eye, where wind speeds are typically the highest - \"total structural failure is likely\".It urged extra caution in Jamaica's \"higher elevation areas\", where wind speeds could be as much as 30% stronger. NHC director Michael Brennan warned Jamaicans: \"Do not venture outside with catastrophic life threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides expected through Tuesday.\"He advised not to \"go out in the eye as it passes over your area. The forward speed of Melissa is going to increase and the eye is going to start to move very quickly across the island.\"Forty inches of rain (100cm) was possible in parts of Jamaica over the next four days, according to the NHC.\"This extreme rainfall potential, owing to the slow motion, is going to create a catastrophic event here for Jamaica,\" said NHC deputy director Jamie Rhome.The Jamaican government has ordered evacuations for parts of Kingston. In a BBC interview, Jamaican Education Minister Dana Morris Dixon warned of an impending storm \"the likes of which we have never seen\".\"We've been having rain all of October. So the ground is already very saturated. And then to take that much rain means we're going to have flooding, extensive flooding and landslides in the mountainous areas,\" she told BBC Newshour.The minister added: \"We have 881 shelters. We have activated all our shelters. All of them are free.''A Hurricane Hunter aircraft, which collects data in severe storms and informs forecasts on the pathway and intensity of hurricanes, was forced to abort a mission  after experiencing severe turbulence, a spokesperson for the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration told CBS. Evadney Campbell, a Londoner currently visiting family on Jamaica's north coast, told the BBC: \"The house that I am in is hurricane proof. It is built with blocks and steel from top to bottom and is filled with concrete.\"We're checking on neighbours to see if they are OK.\"I am worried about people who live on the lowlands in parts of the south-east. Many do not want to leave their homes as they are worried about looting their houses,\" Ms Campbell said.Damian Anderson, a 47-year-old teacher from the mountainous town of Hagley Gap in the south-east, said impassable roads already had cut off his community.\"We can't move. We're scared,\" he was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.Watch: Jamaicans and Cubans prepare for Hurricane MelissaJamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness has ordered the immediate evacuation of several vulnerable communities across the island. In a post on X, he urged \"every Jamaican to prepare, stay indoors during the storm, and comply with evacuation orders\". \"We will weather this storm and rebuild stronger,\" he wrote. \"You have been warned. It's now up to you to use that information to make the right decision,\" he said during a briefing, and told CNN, \"I don't believe there is any infrastructure within this region that could withstand a Category 5 storm, so there could be significant dislocation.\" In some rural areas, school buses were used to ferry vulnerable people to shelters and across the country. Later on Tuesday night, hurricane conditions are expected in Cuba, as well as tropical storm conditions in Haiti, according to the NHS report.The Bahamas will experience hurricane conditions on Wednesday, with tropical storm conditions in the Turks and Caicos Islands on Wednesday. At least three people are already known to have died and hundreds of homes have been flooded in Haiti as Melissa brought torrential rainfall to the island of Hispaniola.In the Dominican Republic, located on the eastern side of Hispaniola, one person also died. Local media identified the victim as a 79-year-old man who had been swept away by  floodwaters in the capital, Santo Domingo. A 13-year-old has also been reported missing after being dragged away by strong currents as he was swimming in the sea. Several people were rescued after being trapped in their cars by the rising floodwater.

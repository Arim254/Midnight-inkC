    "body": "Flights returning to normal after Airbus warning grounded planes13 hours agoHafsa KhalilGetty ImagesThousands of Airbus planes are returning to normal service after being briefly grounded following a warning that solar radiation could interfere with onboard computers.The aerospace giant - based in France - said about 6,000 of its A320 planes had been affected, with most requiring a quick software update. Some 900 older planes need a replacement computer.On Saturday, French Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot said the updates \"went very smoothly\" for more than 5,000 planes, and fewer than 100 still needed the update.Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury apologised for what he called \"logistical challenges and delays\".He said teams were working to ensure that updates are completed \"as swiftly as possible\".On Saturday morning, several Air France flights in and out of Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport were delayed or cancelled.American Airlines said it expected \"operational delays\" but added that the vast majority of updates would be carried out by Saturday. Delta Airlines said it believed the impact on its operations would be limited.The UK Civil Aviation Authority said that airlines operating in the country worked through the night to carry out the update and air traffic had not been seriously affected.London's Gatwick Airport reported \"some disruption\", while Heathrow said it had not experienced any cancellations.Manchester Airport said it did not anticipate significant problems, and Luton Airport reported that there was \"no expected impact\".British Airways and Air India are understood not to be heavily impacted by the issue.On Saturday, Easyjet said it had completed the update on a \"significant number\" of its aircraft, and planned to operate as normal.Wizz Air is also running as normal, having rolled out updates overnight.In Australia, budget airline Jetstar cancelled 90 flights. Most of its aircraft have now undergone the update, but some disruptions are expected though the weekend.Air New Zealand grounded its A320 planes, but all fights have now resumed after the update was completed.Airbus discovered the issue after a JetBlue Airways plane flying between the US and Mexico suddenly lost altitude and emergency landed in October. At least 15 people were injured.The firm identified a problem with the aircraft's computing software which calculates a plane's elevation, and found that at high altitudes, data could be corrupted by intense radiation released periodically by the Sun. As well as the A320, the company's best-selling aircraft, the A318, A319 and the A321 models were also affected.Older planes that require new computers remain grounded. How long the replacement takes will depend on the availability of computers.",

    "body": "Australian children's music group The Wiggles has issued a statement after two of its members were featured in a music video for a song that apparently alludes to drug use.In the since-deleted clip for musician Keli Holiday's new song, Ecstasy, Blue Wiggle Anthony Field and his nephew Dominic Field, who plays the Tree of Wisdom, could be seen dancing in the background.A spokesperson for The Wiggles said the group \"does not condone\" the use of drugs \"in any form\" and that the video had been created without the band's approval.The TikTok video was viewed more than 92,000 times before it was taken down, Australian media report.\"We understand that a video circulating on social media has caused concern for many parents and professionals, and we want to address that directly,\" the group said in a statement to The West Australian newspaper. \"The Wiggles do not support or condone the use of drugs in any form. The content being shared was not created or approved by us, and we have asked for it to be removed.\"While Keli Holiday is a friend of The Wiggles, the video and the music added to it were created independently and without our knowledge.\"The clip was filmed at the TikTok Awards earlier this month where members of the band appeared on stage with Holiday - whose real name is Adam Hyde - during his song Dancing2. Holiday shared the video on TikTok, with the caption \"The Wiggles get it\",  to promote his new single Ecstasy. The song's chorus lyrics are: \"Hey girl, come on dance with me. You and your pocket full of ecstasy.\"A spokesperson for The Wiggles told The West Australian newspaper that the band's performances at the awards had been \"family-friendly\" and that the video had been \"edited together separately and without our awareness\".Created in 1991 as part of a university assignment, The Wiggles has become an international phenomenon among young children. Anthony Fields is the only original member still with the group.Keli Holiday is the solo project of Hyde, who is also known for being one half of electronic dance duo Peking Duk.The BBC has contacted Holiday's management for comment.",

    "body": "Venezuela has accused US President Donald Trump of making a \"colonialist threat\" after he said the airspace around the country should be considered closed.  The country's foreign ministry called Trump's comments \"another extravagant, illegal and unjustified aggression against the Venezuelan people\".The US does not legally have the authority to close another country's airspace, but Trump's online post could lead to travel uncertainty and deter airlines from operating there. The US has been building its military presence in the Caribbean, which officials say is to combat drug smuggling. Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has dismissed US claims of drug trafficking as an attempt to oust him. In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: \"To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.\"The White House did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment. Trump's comments come days after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned airlines of \"heightened military activity in and around Venezuela\".In a statement on Saturday, Venezuela's foreign ministry said that the US had \"unilaterally suspended\" its weekly migrant repatriation flights.\"We call directly on the international community, the sovereign governments of the world, the UN, and the relevant multilateral organizations to firmly reject this immoral act of aggression,\" it said.Venezuela on Wednesday banned six major international airlines – Iberia, TAP Portugal, Gol, Latam, Avianca and Turkish Airlines – from landing there after they failed to meet a 48-hour deadline to resume flights.The US has deployed the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, and about 15,000 troops to within striking distance of Venezuela.It has insisted that the deployment – the largest by the US in the region since it invaded Panama in 1989 – is to combat drug trafficking.On Thursday, Trump warned that US efforts to halt Venezuelan drug trafficking \"by land\" would begin \"very soon\". US forces have carried out at least 21 strikes on boats they said were carrying drugs, killing more than 80 people. However, the US has not provided evidence that the boats carried drugs. The Venezuelan government believes the aim of the US action is to depose Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced by the Venezuelan opposition and many foreign nations as rigged.The US has also designated Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns – a group it alleges is headed by Maduro – as a foreign terrorist organisation.Labelling an organisation as a terrorist group gives US law enforcement and military agencies broader powers to target and dismantle it.Venezuela's foreign ministry has \"categorically, firmly, and absolutely rejected\" the designation.Venezuela's interior and justice minister Diosdado Cabello, who is alleged to be one of the high-ranking members of the cartel, has long called it an \"invention\".The US state department has insisted that the Cartel de los Soles not only exists, but that it has \"corrupted Venezuela's military, intelligence, legislature, and judiciary\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoDanny AeberhardandTom BennettUkrainian naval drones hit two oil tankers from Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\" as they travelled through the Black Sea, Ukrainian officials have said.Footage verified by the BBC shows waterborne drones speeding through the waves into the vessels, before detonating into a ball of flame, sending black smoke into the air.The targeted tankers were named by Turkish authorities as the Kairos and Virat, both flagged to Gambia. Both were hit off the Turkish coast on Friday, with the Virat reportedly struck again on Saturday. No casualties were reported. The attacks appear to be an escalation by Kyiv as it tries to hit Russia's oil revenues, which are critical for funding its war in Ukraine.The two ships are reportedly part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" - a term that refers to the hundreds of tankers used by Russia to bypass Western sanctions imposed after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.The shadow fleet is largely made up of aged tankers, many with obscure ownership or insurance.The Kairos was struck in the south-west area of the Black Sea and the Virat in a central area further east. Both are on a list of ships subject to sanctions, according to London Stock Exchange data.  Sources told BBC Ukrainian that Sea Baby drones were used in the attack - a type of naval drone produced by Ukraine's security services, known as the SBU.Turkish authorities said they had been assisting the vessels, and released footage showing two Turkish boats trying to extinguish the fire on the Kairos.The attacks are seen as a warning by Ukraine, suggesting that ships carrying Russian oil in the Black Sea face the risk of direct attack, not just Western sanctions.Separately, a major consortium transporting oil from the Caspian region said it had suspended loading in the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, after an attack by unmanned boats overnight.The Caspian Pipeline Consortium said the attack had caused significant damage to a mooring point. Russia and Kazakhstan are major stakeholders in the company, which is also part-owned by Western firms like Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Shell.Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that a delegation led by top security official Rustem Umerov was on its way to the US to continue talks on an agreement to end the war. Umerov is set to lead the Ukrainian delegation after the previous lead negotiator, Zelensky's influential chief of staff Andriy Yermak, resigned after anti-corruption detectives searched his apartment on Friday. The Ukrainian delegation is expected to meet American officials in Florida on Sunday. Steve Witkoff, US President Donald Trump's overseas envoy, will hold talks in Moscow next week.",

It is decorated with thousands of blue and turquoise ceramic tiles and receives millions of visitors each year.Pope Francis prayed there in 2014, and Pope Benedict XVI did so in 2006.The first pope to officially enter a mosque was John Paul II, who made history when he visited the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus in 2001. The papal visit to Turkey and Lebanon had been planned by late Pope Francis, but its theme of building bridges was embraced by Pope Leo from the moment he stepped on the balcony of St Peter's Basilica after his election in May.At the start of his trip, he warned that the world should not give into \"a heightened level of conflict on the global level\", adding that \"the future of humanity is at stake\".In Lebanon - where an estimated third of the country is Christian - he is expected to meet more faith leaders and hear from young people. On the final day of the trip, he will celebrate Mass at the Beirut waterfront at the site of the 2020 port explosion, praying for the more than 200 people who were killed and 7,000 others injured.",

The Labor leader's proposal and the wedding reception both took place at his official residence, The Lodge.ReutersAlbanese (right) alongside his son Nathan and his dog Toto - the ring bearerUntil the big day, the wedding plans had been kept under wraps due to concerns about security and potential disruptions.In attendance were Jodie Haydon's parents as well as Albanese's son, Nathan, from his previous marriage.Albanese's dog Toto acted as ring bearer while the couple walked back down the aisle to Stevie Wonder's \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours)\".The prime minister also shared a video on his official social media accounts showing the happy couple walking down the aisle as guests showered them in confetti. Several of Albanese's cabinet ministers attended the ceremony. ReutersAt the reception, their first dance was to The Way You Look Tonight by Frank Sinatra.The celebrations also featured custom-made beer cans printed with the image used to announce their engagement.The couple are set to honeymoon in Australia from Monday to Friday next week - plans that were pared back after his re-election in May.Albanese, 62, and Jodie Haydon, 47, first met at a business dinner in Melbourne in 2020, while he was leader of the opposition.ReutersShe appeared during Albanese's 2022 and 2025 election campaigns, and was seen alongside the PM at major events, including the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II and a state dinner hosted by former US President Joe Biden.Albanese also made Australian history by becoming the first prime minister to get engaged while in office.The couple said in a joint statement at the time that they were \"so lucky to have found each other\".",

    "body": "More than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israel's military campaign in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The death toll has continued to rise since a ceasefire took effect on 10 October, with Israel carrying out air strikes for what it says are violations of the truce - while bodies continue to be recovered from under the rubble.Among those reportedly killed in an Israeli drone strike on Saturday were two young brothers, Fadi and Juma Abu Assi, whose family said they had been gathering firewood when they were killed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC they had struck two suspects who had crossed the so-called yellow line.The line marks where the Israeli military agreed to withdraw to under a ceasefire brokered by the United States more than seven weeks ago.The boys who died have been described in media reports as an eight-year-old and his brother, aged 10 or 11.Relatives said the children had been looking for firewood east of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip when they were killed.Their funeral was held at Nasser Hospital on Saturday.Figures from the Gaza Ministry of Health (MoH) have been widely used throughout the war and are seen as reliable by the United Nations (UN) and international institutions. But Israel has consistently disputed data published by Gaza's authorities.International journalists, including the BBC, are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently, so are unable to verify figures from either side.Gaza's Health Ministry says the Palestinian toll is now 70,100 and that more than 350 of those deaths have happened since the 10 October ceasefire. The Israeli military launched its offensive on Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",

    "body": "13 hours agoAleks PhillipsandYang TianMore than 600,000 people in the Kyiv region of Ukraine were without power on Saturday morning after an overnight Russian attack.Ukraine's energy ministry said more than 500,000 of these were in the capital itself, with the rest in the surrounding region. It attributed the power losses to missile and drone strikes on energy infrastructure in the city and several other regions.Around 36 missiles and nearly 600 drones were launched on targets across Ukraine overnight, officials said, killing three and injuring dozens of others.Russia has intensified attacks on Ukrainian civilian and energy infrastructure as the embattled nation heads into winter, despite US-led efforts to secure a peace deal.Russia's defence ministry said it had launched \"a massive strike... against Ukrainian military-industrial complex enterprises and the energy facilities that support their operation\".Dtek Energy, which serves properties in Kyiv, said later on Saturday that power had been restored to more than 360,000 families.As well as energy infrastructure, several residential buildings were hit in the overnight strikes, Ukrainian officials said.Loud explosions were heard across Kyiv early on Saturday morning. Emergency services were later seen attending to burning blocks of flats damaged by strikes.Kyiv's Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said a 13-year-old child was among the 29 people injured in the capital city.Ukraine's Air Force said it shot down 558 of the drones and 19 of the missiles.Kyiv is among several cities that have suffered regular aerial bombardment since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Many Ukrainians have also had to live through regular blackouts, as Moscow has targeted energy infrastructure in previous winters.On Sunday it is forecast to fall to 2C in Kyiv, which has average temperatures below freezing in December.Ukraine has targeted Russian energy infrastructure, including oil refineries and depots, in particular with long-range weaponry that can probe deep inside Russia. It says this is to curb revenue for Moscow's war effort from Russia's main export.Meanwhile Ukrainian media is reporting that Ukrainian maritime drones struck two oil tankers in the Black Sea on Friday, which are thought to be part of Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\" of vessels used to evade Western sanctions.Video footage published online and verified by the BBC shows a waterborne drone barrelling towards one of the boats, before another video shows fire and smoke billowing out of the vessel's side.The stricken tankers are named Kairos and Virat, according to Turkish authorities. Both are flagged to Gambia. Footage released by Turkey's Transport Ministry shows two of its own boats trying to extinguish the fire on the Kairos.The latest bombardment came as Ukrainian negotiators were preparing for talks with US officials this weekend. US President Donald Trump is pushing for the two sides to accept a draft peace plan, which was initially slanted heavily in favour of Russia but subsequently revised during talks with Ukrainians and their European allies in Geneva.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has welcomed the diplomatic efforts while stressing Kyiv's need to retain its sovereignty and ability to fend off any future attack.On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin repeated his core demands for ending the war, saying Russia would only halt its offensive if Ukraine's troops withdrew from territory claimed by Moscow.Russian forces currently control most - but not all - of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, as well as a portion of the southern Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. US and European allies have called for the war to be frozen along the current front line.Putin also confirmed a US delegation including special envoy Steve Witkoff was expected in Moscow in the first half of next week to discuss the draft peace plan.",

    "body": "Donald Trump has said that he will pardon the former president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted of drug trafficking charges in a US court last year. The US president said Hernández had been \"treated very harshly and unfairly\" in a social media post announcing the move on Friday.Hernández was found guilty in March 2024 of conspiring to import cocaine into the US, and of possessing machine guns. He was sentenced to 45 years in prison.Trump also threw his support behind conservative presidential candidate Nasry \"Tito\" Asfura in the Central American nation's general election, due to be held on Sunday.Hernández, a member of the National Party, who served as Honduras's president from 2014 to 2022, was extradited to the US in April 2022 to stand trial for running a violent drug trafficking conspiracy and helping to smuggle hundreds of tons of cocaine to the US. During his trial, prosecutors in New York said Hernández ran the Central American country like a \"narco-state\" and accepted millions of dollars in bribes from drug traffickers to shield them from the law.He was also ordered to pay a fine of $8m (£6m) as part of his sentence. Polls indicate this year's Honduran election remains a toss-up between three candidates including Asfura, the former mayor of Tegucigalpa and leader of the conservative National Party.Also in the running is Rixi Moncada, a former defence minister standing for the ruling left-wing Libre Party, and Salvador Nasralla, a television host with the centrist Liberal Party.Trump criticised Moncada and Nasralla on Friday, writing that the latter was \"a boderline Communist\" who was only running to split the vote between Moncada and Asfura.He characterised Asfura as \"standing up for democracy\" and praised him for campaigning against Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro, with whom Trump has engaged in a war of words in recent months.Nasralla has pledged to cut ties with Venezuela if he wins.At a press conference on Saturday, Moncada accused Trump of \"interventionist\" meddling after his endorsement of Asfura and his plans to pardon Hernández.The Trump administration has accused the left-wing Maduro - whose re-election last year was dismissed as illegitimate by many countries - of being the leader of a drugs cartel.It used countering drug trafficking as a justification for a military build-up in the Caribbean and has conducted strikes on vessels it says have been used for smuggling - though some analysts have described these moves as a means of pressuring Latin American leaders.Honduras has been governed since 2022 by President Xiomara Castro, who has forged close ties with Cuba and Venezuela.But Castro has maintained a co-operative relationship with the US, agreeing to preserve a long-running extradition treaty with it. Her country also hosts a US military base involved in targeting transnational organised crime in the region. More than 80 people have been killed in the US strikes on vessels suspected of being involved in the transport of narcotics since they began in August.US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth has said the aim of \"Operation Southern Spear\" was to eliminate \"narcoterrorists\". But legal experts have questioned the legality of the strikes, pointing out that the US has provided no evidence that the boats it has targeted were carrying drugs.",

    "body": "Three days of mourning begin after Hong Kong's deadliest fire in decades13 hours agoTabby WilsonHong Kong officials mark beginning of official mourning period with moment of silenceHong Kong officials have held a moment of silence at the start of a three-day mourning period to remember those killed after the city's deadliest fire in nearly 80 years.At least 128 people are now known to have died in the fire, which engulfed seven tower blocks on Wednesday. A further 83 were injured and 150 remain unaccounted for.Eight people have been arrested on suspicion of corruption over the renovation works the blocks had been undergoing. Three others were detained earlier on manslaughter charges.The cause of the fire has yet to be determined, but officials have said it spread up and between the blocks rapidly because of flammable materials placed on their exterior.Saturday morning's ceremony was held outside government headquarters, and saw city leader John Lee joined by other Hong Kong officials to observe three minutes of silence.The flags of China and Hong Kong were flown at half mast. The government has also set up memorial points across the city, where the public can pay their respects and sign condolence books.Once the fire started, it spread quickly to seven of the eight towers in Wang Fuk Court, in Hong Kong's northerly suburban Tai Po distric.It then took more than 2,000 firefighters almost two days to bring the blaze under control.The cause of the fire remains unclear, though authorities have said that polystyrene placed on the outside of the windows and plastic netting around the scaffolding on the buildings facilitated its spread.The tower blocks were also covered in bamboo scaffolding, which is commonly used for construction and renovation work in Hong Kong. The fire has sparked a debate on whether it should still be used.ReutersOfficials have confirmed that an investigation will be taking place over the next few weeks, with police already gathering evidence from the scene.The fire has caused anger throughout Hong Kong - which is known for its high-rise buildings - as questions about who should be held accountable grow.Residents of Wang Fuk Court have reported broken fire alarms and negligence from the company carrying out the renovations on the Wang Fuk Court, while Hong Kong's fire service has said fire alarms in all eight blocks were not working effectively.The Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) said those arrested in the corruption probe on Friday included directors at an engineering company and scaffolding subcontractors.Hong Kong's Labour and Welfare Secretary, Chris Sun, told reporters that his department had made 16 checks on the works at Wang Fuk Court since July last year.The housing estate was built in 1983 and had provided 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census.",

    "body": "Flooding across Asia leaves 600 dead and hundreds missing8 hours agoJessica RawnsleyGetty ImagesSearch and rescue operations are ongoing across Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Sri Lanka, with hundreds still missingTorrential rains have triggered floods and landslides across parts of southern Asia, killing around 600 people.Monsoon rain exacerbated by tropical storms caused some of the region's worst flooding in years, with millions affected in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Sri Lanka.Intense rainfall began on the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Wednesday. \"During the flood, everything was gone,\" a resident of Bireuen in Sumatra's Aceh province told Reuters news agency. \"I wanted to save my clothes, but my house came down.\" With hundreds still missing, the death toll is likely to rise. Thousands remain stranded, some awaiting rescue on rooftops.As of Saturday more than 300 people had died in Indonesia and 160 in Thailand. There were also several deaths reported in Malaysia.In Sri Lanka, which has been battered by Cyclone Ditwah, more than 130 people are dead and some 170 missing, officials said.Aerial footage shows severe flooding across southern Asia after torrential rainsAn exceptionally rare tropical cyclone, named Cyclone Senyar, caused catastrophic landslides and flooding in Indonesia, with homes swept away and thousands of buildings submerged.Indonesia's disaster agency said on Saturday that nearly 300 people were still missing after flooding devastated Sumatra.\"The current was very fast, in a matter of seconds it reached the streets, entered the houses,\" a resident in Aceh Province, Arini Amalia, told the BBC. She and her grandmother raced to a relative's house on higher terrain. On returning the following day to retrieve some belongings, she said the flood had completely swallowed the house: \"It's already sunk.\"After waters rapidly rose in West Sumatra and submerged his home, Meri Osman said he was \"swept away by the current\" and clung onto a clothesline until he was rescued.The bad weather has hampered rescue operations, and while tens of thousands of people have been evacuated, hundreds are still stranded, the Indonesian disaster agency said.Getty ImagesIn Indonesia hundreds are still missing after heavy rains wreaked havoc on the island of SumatraIn Thailand's southern Songkhla province, water rose 3m (10ft) and at least 145 people died in one of the worst floods in a decade.Across the 10 provinces hit by flooding, more than 160 people have been killed, the government said on Saturday. More than 3.8 million people have been affected.The city of Hat Yai experienced 335mm of rainfall in a single day, the heaviest in 300 years. As waters receded, officials recorded a sharp rise in the death toll. At one hospital in Hat Yai, employees were forced to move bodies to refrigerated trucks after the morgue became overwhelmed, news agency AFP reported.\"We were stuck in the water for seven days and no agency came to help,\" Hat Yai resident Thanita Khiawhom told BBC Thai.The government has promised relief measures, including compensation of up to two million baht ($62,000) for households that lost family members. Getty ImagesTens of thousands of people have taken refuge in shelters in ThailandIn neighbouring Malaysia, the death toll is far lower, but the damage is just as devastating.Flooding has wreaked havoc and left parts of northern Perlis state under water, with two people dead and tens of thousands forced into shelters.Sri Lanka is also grappling with one of its worst weather disasters in recent years, and the government has declared a state of emergency.More than 15,000 homes have been destroyed and some 78,000 people forced into temporary shelters, officials said. They added that about a third of the country was without electricity or running water.Meteorologists have said the extreme weather in South East Asia may have been caused by the interaction of Typhoon Koto in the Philippines and the rare formation of Cyclone Senyar in the Malacca Strait.The region's annual monsoon season, typically between June and September, often brings heavy rain.Climate change has altered storm patterns, including the intensity and duration of the season, resulting in heavier rainfall, flash flooding and stronger winds.Getty ImagesSri Lanka's government has declared a state of emergency and appealed for international assistanceMore on this story",

    "body": "15 hours agoNatasha Booty,Chris Ewokor,AbujaandChiagozie Nwonwu,LagosThe Nigerian government says jihadist groups Boko Haram and Islamic State in West Africa Province (Iswap) are behind the recent wave of abductions in north-western and central Nigeria, but this has been disputed by analysts who tell the BBC they were committed by criminal gangs locally known as \"bandits\".This is the first time the government has stated who it believes is responsible for the kidnappings but it has not revealed any evidence to back its claims.Kidnap for ransom has become big business in parts of Nigeria in recent years - with the culprits ranging from kidnap gangs, jihadists and separatists.It is a lucrative money-spinner but officials consistently deny paying ransoms.In the past fortnight alone, there have been three mass kidnappings in the region:17 November - in Maga, Kebbi state, at Government Girls Comprehensive secondary school. Two people were killed and 25 abducted including one teacher - now all free18 November - in Eruku, Kwara state, at Christ Apostolic Church. Two were killed and 38 abducted - all since freed21 November - in Papiri, Niger state, at St Mary's Catholic School. More than 250 children and 12 members of staff reportedly kidnapped, although officials question these figuresPaying ransoms has been made illegal in Nigeria, although there are allegations this ban has been widely ignored.Speaking to the BBC, presidential spokesman Sunday Dare would not say whether money had been paid to free the minority of abductees who were recently released, simply stating: \"Whatever processes are involved - kinetic, non-kinetic, negotiations, etc - have been successful.\"Asked who was behind the kidnappings, he replied: \"Abundant data - both nationally and internationally - reveals clearly that Iswap are all over the place. Also, whatever is left of Boko Haram, they are right there,\" he continued. \"They are the ones involved in this process.\"Iswap is a splinter group of Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which has been waging an insurgency in north-eastern Nigeria for more than a decade.Mr Dare also reiterated President Bola Tinubu's promise to ensure the remaining abductees would be rescued, but failed to give assurances on how long it would take.In some of the worst cases in the past, kidnapped children have died at the hands of their captors - or been held for years on end, as in the case of the infamous Chibok kidnappings by Boko Haram.Analyst Bulama Bukarti told the BBC he did not agree with the government's claims that jihadist groups were behind the recent wave of kidnappings.\"I don't think that's accurate. There is no Iswap or Boko Haram cell resident in the north-west. The recent kidnappings, including the mass abductions, were carried out by bandits, not Boko Haram or Iswap,\" he said.The bandits are local armed groups, often on motorbikes, with no central organisation, who operate mainly in the north-west. Whereas Boko Haram and Iswap mainly operate hundreds of miles away, in Nigeria's north-east.The BBC asked Acled - an international monitoring group that analyses attacks by armed groups - to assess the three kidnappings.Acled said in all three cases Fulani militia groups, locally called \"bandits\", were responsible for the kidnappings.Fulani herders have come into conflict with both Muslim and Christian communities across Nigeria.It said the biggest of the recent kidnappings, in which more than 200 schoolchildren were reportedly abducted from St Mary's Catholic School, \"appears to have been partly carried out to spite the government and achieve some political objectives\".The church attack in southern Kwara state was \"part of the Fulani expansionist drive, and as a way to displace the locals from the communities for illegal mining activities\", Acled told the BBC. \"Local displacement for mining has become the emerging pattern of the Fulani militia activities as seen in Zamfara state and the Birnin Gwari area of Kaduna state.\"Shortly after the mass kidnappings in north-western and central Nigeria, 13 teenage girls were abducted in north-eastern Borno state, the stronghold of Boko Haram. Analysts agree that this is likely to have been the work of jihadist groups.Nigeria's security crisis has been thrown into the international spotlight in recent weeks after US President Donald Trump threatened to send over troops \"guns a-blazing\" if the government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\". Nigerian officials and analysts say that members of all faiths are victims of the violence and kidnappings, and say it is not true that Christians are being targeted.",

    "body": "18 hours agoYang TianandJames FitzGeraldWatch: Trump announces death of National Guard member Sarah BeckstromThe Trump administration has halted all asylum decisions following the shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington DC, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) director has said.Joseph Edlow said the pause would be in place \"until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible\".It came hours after US President Donald Trump pledged to \"permanently pause migration\" from all \"third world countries\".The flurry of immigration decisions come in the wake of Wednesday's shooting, which left one soldier dead and another in a critical condition, and which officials have accused an Afghan national for perpetrating.While the first of these specifically targeted Afghans seeking to enter the US, other decisions have been far more wide-reaching.The USCIS - a branch of the Department of Homeland Security - has been told not to approve, deny or close asylum applications it receives for all nationalities, according CBS News, the BBC's US partner.Its officers can continue to work on asylum applications and review cases up to the point of making a decision, CBS reported.But few details are known about Friday's directive.Trump did not name which countries might be affected by his migration pause, which could face legal challenges and has already prompted pushback from UN agencies.The US president's recent announcements represent a further toughening of his stance towards migrants during his second presidency.Trump has also sought to enact mass deportations of illegal migrants, cut the annual number of refugee admissions, and to end automatic citizenship rights currently applicable to many born on US territory.Following Wednesday's fatal attack, the Trump administration temporarily stopped issuing visas to Afghans through the same programme the shooting suspect had, before suspending all immigration requests from Afghans pending a review.Then on Thursday, the USCIS said it would re-examine green cards issued to individuals who had migrated to the US from 19 countries, without mentioning Wednesday's attack.The agency referred to a June proclamation that included Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Somalia and Venezuela. Details on what re-examination would look like were not provided.Trump then pledged to \"end all federal benefits and subsidies to non-citizens\" on Thursday. 'Third-world countries'Trump blamed refugees for causing the \"social dysfunction in America\" and vowed to remove \"anyone who is not a net asset\" to the US.\"Hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia were completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota,\" he said.\"I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover.\"The phrase \"third world\" is one previously used to describe poorer, developing nations. Earlier this year, a travel ban was imposed on nationals primarily from 11 African and Asian nations, including Afghanistan. During Trump's first term, he enacted a travel ban targeting multiple Muslim-majority countries.The UN has urged the US to observe international agreements on asylum seekers, news agency Reuters reported.Trump's reaction to the shooting amounted to a \"scapegoating\" of migrants in the US, argued Jeremy McKinney, the former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.He told the BBC World Service's Newsday programme before Trump's latest remarks that the attacker's motive were unclear, and that radicalisation and mental illness could affect anyone. \"These types of issues - they don't know skin colour, they don't know nationality.\"Suspect in DC shooting is AfghanOfficials said the shooting suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, came to the US in 2021.He travelled under a programme that offered special protections to Afghans who had worked with US forces in Afghanistan before their chaotic withdrawal and the return to power of the Taliban. Mr Lakanwal had been a member of a \"Zero Unit\" - an Afghan intelligence and paramilitary force that worked with the CIA - a former Afghan defence and security forces member told CBS.The US considered Zero Units to be among the most respected domestic forces in Afghanistan.The CIA's current director has confirmed that he previously worked with the US intelligence agency.FBI: Suspect had relationship with 'partner forces' in AfghanistanHe would have been vetted by the US both when he started working with the CIA and when he travelled to the US, a senior US official told CNN.A childhood friend told the New York Times that Mr Lakanwal had experienced mental health issues after his work with his unit.Mr Lakanwal was reportedly granted asylum after Trump returned to office, having applied in 2024.But his request for a green card - which shows a person has permanent residence in the US - is pending, an official told CBS.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "Fall of Zelensky's top aide - reboot for Kyiv or costly shake-up?14 hours agoJames WaterhouseUkraine correspondent, KyivReutersAndriy Yermak was one of Ukraine's most powerful figuresAndriy Yermak was a constant, looming presence in Ukraine's government - a seemingly immovable figure on the political stage.Despite his towering frame, you might not always have spotted him. Yet, wherever President Volodymyr Zelensky was, Yermak was often not far away.As his chief of staff, Yermak wielded enormous power at the top of government and was even trusted to negotiate on Ukraine's behalf at peace talks with the US.But as his influence grew, so did public resentment of the power this unelected official held. His political career came to an abrupt end on Friday, hours after anti-corruption investigators raided his home in Kyiv.Yermak and Zelensky first met in 2011 when the former was an intellectual property lawyer and the latter a TV producer.After working together during the successful presidential campaign of 2019, Yermak became Zelensky's chief of staff. He stood next to the president as he gave his now famous \"we are still here\" speech as the Russians descended on Kyiv at the start of their full-scale invasion in February 2022.As Zelensky concentrated his power over time, Yermak was widely viewed as the second most powerful person in Ukraine. He reportedly helped shape foreign policy, ousted political rivals and even made battlefield decisions.ReutersYermak (right) was always at the centre of the action in Ukraine's governmentUkrainian politics is shaped by big characters, and Zelensky's administration had not one, but two of them.Despite the favourable conditions Yermak enjoyed within the sprawling Presidential Office, the same couldn't be said outside its steep walls.His popularity was nosediving.A widening scandalZelensky had successfully grappled with corruption scandals in the past, but in July a chain of events began that has shaken the current government to its core, weakening him politically and costing him his right-hand man.That month, the president convinced parliament to formally remove the independence of Ukraine's two anti-corruption bodies and bring them under direct government control.At the time, Zelensky said it was to limit Russian interference. But the public - as well as the European Union - disagreed, and he was forced to U-turn after mass demonstrations.Getty ImagesThe decision to strip anti-corruption bodies of their independence sparked mass protests, which in turn forced a government U-turnBy the autumn, those same agencies, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and the Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sapo), released the findings of a lengthy investigation that implicated members of Zelensky's inner circles.Senior figures - including two ministers, a former deputy prime minister and a one-time business partner of Zelensky's - were accused of syphoning $100m (£75m) from public projects in the energy sector.At a time when Russia is pummelling Ukraine's energy grid with missiles and drones ahead of a fourth winter of war - forcing the entire country to endure daily power cuts - public anger at these corruption allegations has soared. Just on Friday night alone, Kyiv endured a nearly 11-hour-long Russian air raid, which left more than half a million people without power.\"We're going through one of the most difficult times in our history,\" Iryna, a Kyiv resident, told the BBC this week. \"Unfortunately, lots of families will not see their loved ones, their men, brothers or husbands, because of the war.\"Despite not being named as a suspect and denying any involvement in the scheme, Andriy Yermak couldn't distance himself. There was a suspicion he may have known something. Local media reported on Saturday that investigators were combing through several laptops and mobile phones they had seized from his flat during their search.Yermak led last week's talks with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Geneva, apparently securing some concessions for his country in a US-drafted peace proposal which many feared heavily favoured Russia.Getty ImagesMr Yermak was a key figure in negotiations with the USAt a time when Ukraine is fighting and negotiating for its very survival, his resignation is hugely destabilising.Talks will continue next week. Ukraine's presidential office said on Saturday that Defence Minister Rustem Umerov was the head of a delegation heading to the US.What is not known is whether this will be a timely reboot for Kyiv, or a costly lack of continuity.It is also not known how Yermak is taking his sudden departure from government. The New York Post reported on Saturday that he had texted their paper and vowed to go to the front line. He also declared his innocence. \"I'm going to the front and am prepared for any reprisals,\" he reportedly said. \"I am an honest and decent person.\"But there is a feeling that Yermak's departure is a sign of positive change.\"Let's call it what it is: good news,\" says Olga Rudenko, editor of the Kyiv Independent.\"Think about it: a young democracy like Ukraine has independent institutions that are strong enough to investigate the most powerful man in the country - and to do so during the war.\"People rooting for Ukraine around the world aren't rooting for a place on the map, but for a place living by certain values - and fighting for them. Today we see these values in action.\"This shows why Ukraine is exactly the country worth supporting.\"Additional reporting by Toby Luckhurst",

    "body": "6 hours agoTiffanie TurnbullSydneyGetty ImagesThe erotic age-gap novel sexually objectifies children, a judge has saidAn Australian author has been found guilty of creating child sex abuse material in the form of an erotic age-gap romance novel.A New South Wales (NSW) court heard the book explores a relationship between 18-year-old Lucy and her father's 45-year-old best friend Arthur - detailing the much-older man's desires which began when the protagonist was a child as well as passages where she roleplays as a toddler.Lauren Mastrosa, a marketing executive for a Christian charity, was charged after the book sparked outrage online but in court she argued Lucy is clearly identified as an adult in the novel.However, Magistrate Bree Chisholm on Tuesday found Mastrosa's story \"sexually objectifies children\".Mastrosa, 34, issued an advance release of the novel - which the BBC has chosen not to name - to 21 readers in March last year before a complaint about its content was made to police.Chisholm read the whole book, published under the pen name Tori Woods, and found a reasonable reader would find it \"undeniably offensive\".Throughout the novel - the cover of which is pastel pink with the title spelled out in children's alphabet blocks - the protagonist uses child-like language, wears children's clothing, and engages in child-like behaviour.Chisholm said any references to the character being 18 were insufficient to overcome the implication of her as a child.\"Importantly, those descriptions and language are used in the portions of the book to describe a character similar to a young child when the sexual activity is occurring,\" Chisholm said, according to the Australian Associated Press.\"The reader is left with a description that creates the visual image in one's mind of an adult male engaging in sexual activity with a young child.\"Found guilty of one count each of creating, possessing and distributing child abuse material, Mastrosa will return to court to be sentenced on 28 April.When Mastrosa was charged, BaptistCare told the Daily Telegraph she had been stood down from her role pending an investigation.",

    "body": "6 hours agoTabby WilsonGetty ImagesSinger Chappell Roan says she has left the talent agency led by Casey Wasserman, whose name appears in the Epstein files.Announcing her split with the agency, Roan said she has a \"duty to protect her team\" and her decision reflected her belief that \"meaningful change in our industry requires accountability\".Wasserman has been criticised after his flirtatious emails to Ghislaine Maxwell, sent in 2003, were revealed among the millions of files published in relation to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Roan made no mention of Epstein, nor the Epstein files, in her statement on Instagram announcing her departure.\"As of today, I am no longer represented by Wasserman, the talent agency led by Casey Wasserman,\" she said. Roan added: \"No artist, agent or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values.\" The BBC has reached out to Wasserman for comment.Wasserman is also the chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games, and has faced calls to step down from the position following the release of the emails.He said in a statement that his correspondence with Maxwell \"took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light\".Who is in the Epstein files?Wasserman also emphasised that he had \"never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein\".\"As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane,\" he said.\"I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.\"Wasserman has not been accused of wrongdoing by any of Epstein's victims, and the appearance of his name in the files does not imply criminal activity of any kind.Roan's announcement comes after two other bands represented by Wasserman released statements indicating they wanted to distance themselves from his agency.Wednesday, a self-described indie rock band, said they were \"aghast\" to see Wasserman feature in the Epstein files and did not want to continue to be associated with him. They said that they hoped he would step down \"for the sake of his staff\".Rock band Beach Bunny said they were \"hugely disappointed and disgusted\" that Wasserman \"had involvement with Ghislaine Maxwell\".",

    "body": "11 hours agoTabby WilsonGetty ImagesAward-winning actress Catherine O'Hara died of a pulmonary embolism, her death certificate in the US has revealed. O'Hara died on 30 January in a Los Angeles hospital, at the age of 71. In addition to the blood clot in her lungs, the death certificate listed rectal cancer as the long-term cause of death. It was indicated that she had been receiving treatment for the cancer since March 2025. Tributes have poured in for the Canadian actress, who most recently appeared in the Emmy-winning comedy The Studio and The Last of Us.O'Hara rememberedActor and The Studio creator Seth Rogen said he was devastated by O'Hara's death, describing the actress as \"hysterical, kind, intuitive, generous\". \"We're all lucky we got to live in a world with her in it,\" he said.Actor Pedro Pascal, who worked with O'Hara on The Last of Us, wrote on Instagram: \"Oh, genius to be near you. Eternally grateful. There is less light in my world, this lucky world that had you, will keep you, always.\"The actress starred in six seasons of comedy series Schitt's Creek, for which she won an Emmy for best comedy actress. Show creator and co-star Eugene Levy told People magazine that he has had the \"honor of knowing and working with the great Catherine O'Hara for over fifty years\".\"Words seem inadequate to express the loss I feel today,\" he said. Co-creator Dan Levy, who played O'Hara's son David, described her as \"family before she ever played my family\".He added on Instagram that he would \"cherish every funny memory I was fortunate enough to make with her\".O'Hara's on-screen son in holiday classics Home Alone and Home Alone 2: Lost In New York, Macaulay Culkin, also paid an emotional tribute on Instagram.\"Mama. I thought we had time. I wanted more. I wanted to sit in a chair next to you,\" he wrote.\"I heard you. But I had so much more to say. I love you. I'll see you later.\"O'Hara is survived by her husband Bo Welch, her sons Matthew and Luke, and her six siblings.What is a pulmonary embolism?According to the NHS, a pulmonary embolism is a life-threatening condition that occurs when a blood vessel in the lungs is blocked by a blood clot.Symptoms include a sudden difficulty in breathing, chest pain that increases when breathing and coughing up blood.

    "body": "'Mum is still out there' - Savannah Guthrie issues new plea as ransom deadline passes3 hours agoMax MatzaWatch: \"We are at an hour of desperation\", says Guthrie in new plea for missing motherUS news presenter Savannah Guthrie has said her family believes their abducted mother is still alive, as she issued a new appeal to anyone with information.\"We believe our mum is still out there,\" she said in a video posted to her Instagram account. \"We need your help.\"As a reported ransom deadline for the safe return of Guthrie's mother Nancy passed on Monday, officials said they had still not identified a suspect or person of interest.The 84-year-old disappeared in the middle of night from her home in Tucson, Arizona, and was last seen on 31 January. Authorities believe she was taken against her will.ReutersThe family had earlier indicated that they would be willing to pay for her safe return.The FBI said they are not aware of \"any continued communication between the Guthrie family and suspected kidnappers\". It is offering a $50,000 (£36,000) reward for any information. The FBI also said it is taking an email with a ransom note sent to US media outlets stating the Monday deadline seriously, the BBC's US partner CBS reported.A previous alleged deadline for ransom, which was meant to be paid in Bitcoin, passed on 5 February. Nancy was reported missing when she did not attend a Sunday church service on 1 February and other members grew concerned.The family has released three other videos saying they were willing to speak to the potential abductors, and asking for proof that their mother is still alive.\"I just want to share a few thoughts as we enter another week of this nightmare,\" Savannah Guthrie says in the latest clip, in which she appears alone unlike previous recordings where she has been joined by her siblings.   \"She was taken, and we don't know where. And we need your help,\" Guthrie says.Guthrie requests people everywhere, \"even if you're far from Tucson\", to report anything suspicious that could lead to clues about her mother.She continues: \"If you see anything, if you hear anything, if there's anything at all that seems strange to you, that you report to law enforcement\".In an update just before Monday's deadline, the Pima County Sheriff's Office said it did not have any new information to release publicly. The sheriff's statement added that the \"investigation into Nancy Guthrie's disappearance remains active and ongoing\", and that \"the FBI is handling all aspects related to any ransom note(s) or communications involving the Guthrie family\".The FBI also released a statement, saying that FBI agents from around the country \"continue to deploy to Tucson\".\"We are currently operating a 24-hour command post that includes crisis management experts, analytic support, and investigative teams. But we still need the public's help,\" the FBI statement added, including the number for the FBI's tip line.'We will pay': Savannah Guthrie's message in a previous video",

    "body": "2 hours agoHugh SchofieldParisAFP via Getty ImagesEmmanuel Macron warned that \"today Europe faces a massive challenge, in a world of disorder\"French President Emmanuel Macron has urged Europe to assert itself on the world stage, saying it is time to start acting like a \"power\".In the face of growing threats from China, Russia and now the US, he told a group of European newspapers that the continent faced a \"wake-up call\".\"Are we ready to become a power? This is the question in the field of economy and finance, in defence and security, and in our democratic systems. \"In another era we might have said it is the moment to 'assume our majority',\" he said ahead of an EU summit in Brussels later this week.Macron repeated his call for EU-wide mutualised loans in order to raise hundreds of billions of euros needed for industrial investment.\"The time has come to launch a shared debt capacity to fund our future expense -  eurobonds for the future. We need big European programmes to finance the best projects,\" he said.Similar calls in the past have met scepticism from Germany and other countries, who feel France wants to use Europe to bear a financial burden which it alone - because of its failure to reform - is unable to take up.Macron admitted that France \"has never had a balanced model, unlike certain economies of the north, which are built more on a sense of responsibility. \"And we have never had reforms like the ones initiated in the 2010s in Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece, which are paying dividends today.\"But he said there was growing demand in the world's financial markets for mutualised European debt, which currently the EU was not equipped to supply.\"The world markets are increasingly afraid of the American greenback [dollar]. They want alternatives… \"For investors everywhere a democratic state of law is a huge attraction. And when I look at the world as it is, we have the authoritarian regime that is China, and on the other side we have the US distancing itself further and further from a state of law.\"According to Macron, the 27-member EU needs €1,2tn (£1tn; $1.4tn) a year to invest in the vital sectors of security and defence, clean energy, and artificial intelligence.Calling on the EU to \"protect\" these and other industries, he said: \"The Chinese do it, the Americans too.  Europe today is the most open market in the world.\"In the face of that, I am not saying we should be protectionist. It's more a question of being coherent - in other words not imposing on our own producers rules which we do not impose on non-Europeans.\"\"Today Europe faces a massive challenge, in a world of disorder,\" he said.\"Climate change is accelerating. The US – which we thought would guarantee our security for ever – is no longer sure. Russia was to give us cheap energy for ever, but that stopped three years ago. China... has become a rival that gets fiercer and fiercer.\"Today, we Europeans are on our own. But we have each other. We are 450 million people. It's huge. For me [becoming a power] is the fulfilment of the European adventure.\"We came together to stop war, we came together to build a market. But we always forbade ourselves to think of power.\"Asked about the latest stand-off with Washington over Greenland, at the end of which US President Donald Trump appeared to back down from threats to annex the Danish territory,  Macron said the Europeans should not be fooled.\"At the end of a crisis, there is a cowardly tendency to sit back and say 'phew'. There are threats and intimidation, and then suddenly Washington gives way. And people think it's over.\"Don't believe it for a single second,\" the French leader said.",

    "body": "2 hours agoNick EdserBusiness reporterBloomberg via Getty ImagesBP has reported a drop in annual profits and increased its target for cost cutting as the oil giant was hit by the fall in crude prices last year.It reported profits of $7.5bn (£5.5bn) in 2025, down from $8.9bn the year before, after the price of oil fell by about 20%.BP also said it was suspending its share buyback programme and cutting spending as it seeks to strengthen its finances.The company has recently switched strategy away from investment in renewable energy projects to refocus on oil and gas operations, and new boss Meg O'Neill, who takes up her position in April, is expected to continue this trend.O'Neill, formerly head of Australian oil and gas firm Woodside Energy, will be the the first woman to run a major global oil firm.Carol Howle, BP's current interim chief executive, said the company looked forward to O'Neill's arrival \"as we accelerate our progress to build a simpler, stronger and more valuable BP for the future\".The company has come under pressure from its shareholders for underperforming compared to its rivals in recent years.A year ago, BP announced it was cutting planned investments in renewable energy to spend billions of dollars more a year on its core oil and gas operations.The energy giant is trying to cut its debts, which currently stand at about $22bn.Announcing its latest results, BP said it aimed to make cost savings of $5.5bn-$6.5bn by the end of 2027. This is an increase from its previous target of up to $5bn, and comes after its decision to sell a 65% stake in its Castrol business.\"Management is taking some decisive action to fix the balance sheet, scrapping the buyback, doubling down on non-core disposals and upping structural cost-savings targets,\" said Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown.Profits in the final three months of the year fell 30% to $1.54bn, in a period when the price of Brent crude oil fell below $60 a barrel for the first time in more than four years.BP's annual profits have now fallen for three years in a row. They peaked at $27.7bn in 2022 when oil prices soared in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Rival oil giant Shell also announced a fall in profits when it posted its annual results last week. Shell reported underlying earnings of $18.53bn for 2025, a 22% fall on the previous year.ReutersMeg O'Neill will take up her new role in AprilO'Neill takes over at BP at a difficult time for the oil giant. Its previous boss, Murray Auchincloss, stepped down after less than two years in the job.He had replaced Bernard Looney, who was dismissed by BP in 2023 after he was found to have committed \"serious misconduct\" in failing to disclose relationships with colleagues.Cornelia Meyer, chief executive of Meyer Resources and a former BP executive, told the BBC that O'Neill had \"a stellar track record\", and when it comes to reviving BP's fortunes, \"if anybody can, she probably can\".She added O'Neill would \"instil discipline\", noting \"she's an oil woman, she's not a renewables woman\".However, BP is facing questions from some groups over its recent investment decisions.Nick Mazan from ACCR, the shareholder advocacy and research organisation that has tabled the resolution, said by halting its share buyback and continuing to invest in oil and gas, \"BP doesn't appear to have shareholder interests at heart\".\"While the pivot back to oil and gas has been justified by scapegoating the low carbon business, our analysis shows that the upstream business has been the source of 75% of disposal losses and impairments since 2020.\"",

    "body": "24 hours agoJack BurgessWorld Without ExploitationSurvivors appeared in the advert with black redaction marks over their mouthsSurvivors of late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have appeared in an advert calling for the release of more files related to him.In the 40 second video from the World Without Exploitation group, released in the US on Super Bowl Sunday, survivors held up photographs of their younger selves and said \"we all deserve the truth\".The US Department of Justice (DOJ) was required by law to make all the files public in December last year. However, only some have been released - many with redactions.The DOJ said files not published were either unrelated, duplicates, or had been withheld under deliberative process or attorney-client privilege, or because they depicted violence.Deliberative process privilege allows US government agencies to withhold documents which reflect decision-making processes, while attorney-client privilege is intended to protect the confidentiality of communications between lawyers and clients.Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche said last month that the most recent release of material, on 30 January, \"marks the end of a very comprehensive document identification and review process\".Blanche also said there was a \"built in assumption that somehow there's this hidden tranche of information of men that we know about that we're covering up or that we're not we're choosing not to prosecute\", before adding \"that is not the case\".Sunday's advert featuring the survivors began with a text slate on screen that said: \"On November 19, 2025, the Epstein Files Transparency Act was signed into law.\" It continued with a statement that said: \"3 MILLION FILES Still Have Not Been Released.\"The survivors appeared with black redaction marks over their mouths, addressed the camera directly and each said \"we're standing together\". The advert concluded with a call for people to \"stand with us\" and \"Tell Attorney General Pam Bondi IT'S TIME FOR THE TRUTH\".While the video was released on the day of the Super Bowl it was not aired on television during the match, which traditionally has the largest television audience in the US.The group told the Reuters news agency it could not afford to air a commercial during the game, noting that a 30-second Super Bowl advertisement can cost \"more than $8 million (£5.9m)\".The DOJ's release of documents has shed light on the disgraced financier's close association with many prominent people. However, the justice department has faced heavy scrutiny after missing the 19 December deadline to release all files as mandated in the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which passed Congress and was signed into law in November.Ghislaine Maxwell, the jailed associate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, is scheduled to appear before the congressional committee investigating the federal government's handling of the Epstein files on Monday.She has agreed to testify under oath but her legal team previously said she would decline to answer questions under her constitutional right to remain silent unless she is granted legal immunity.",

    "body": "Kenya to confront Russia over 'unacceptable' use of its nationals in combat2 hours agoPeter Mwangangi,BBC Swahili, NairobiandNatasha BootyUkraine Defence IntelligenceClinton Mogesa, 29, died while fighting for RussiaKenya says it will talk to Russia over growing reports that its citizens are being recruited to fight in the war in Ukraine. Speaking to the BBC, Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi called the practice \"unacceptable and clandestine\", and said Nairobi had shut down illegal recruiters and would urge Moscow to sign a deal banning the conscription of Kenyan soldiers.The Kenyan government estimates that around 200 of its nationals have been recruited to fight for Russia. The exact number remains unclear, as Nairobi maintains that none of them travelled through official channels.\"Kenya and Russia have had long relations since independence, literally. So this, in my view, becomes a very unfortunate episode of otherwise very positive and cordial relations between our two countries,\" he added.Mudavadi has told the BBC that Kenya's engagement with Russia will focus on curbing illegal recruitment practices, including discussions on visa policy and bilateral labour agreements excluding military conscription.He said the Kenyan authorities had closed more than 600 recruitment agencies suspected of duping Kenyans with promises of jobs overseas.So far 27 Kenyans who had been fighting in Russia have been repatriated, he said, with authorities providing psychological care to address their trauma and \"de-radicalise\" them.\"Families that we've spoken to say they have not been able to bury their loved ones because their bodies are still on the other end,\" Kenya's foreign minister said. \"It is difficult because, remember, it depends on where the body has been found. There some have been found in Ukraine - we are also working with the government of Ukraine to try and get the remains of those people repatriated.\"Pressure has been mounting on the Kenyan government to act after the recent discovery of more bodies of citizens who had been recruited to fight for Russian armed forces.Some of the affected families have told the BBC that they lay the blame squarely on Kenya's government, for failing to regulate and criminalise clandestine recruitment agencies.But the Kenyan foreign minister rejects this.\"You cannot blame the government on this,\" Mudavadi told the BBC. \"Where there are illegal recruitment agencies, we have scrapped them and we continue to scrap them.\"Ukrainian intelligence assessment estimates that more than 1,400 people from 36 countries in Africa have been recruited to fight for Russia. Ukraine has also previously come in for criticism for trying to recruit foreign nationals, including Africans, to fight on its side.Ukrainian officials have repeatedly warned that anyone fighting for Russia will be treated as an enemy combatant, and that the only safe route out is to surrender and be treated as a prisoner of war.Additional reporting by Basillioh RukangaYou may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "3 hours agoNardine SaadAFP via Getty ImagesThe Gordie Howe International Bridge will connect southern Detroit, Michigan, USA, and Windsor, Ontario, Canada when completedPresident Donald Trump has threatened to block the opening of a bridge connecting the US and Canada until Washington is \"fully compensated for everything\" it has given to its northern neighbour.The Gordie Howe International Bridge, connecting the Canadian province of Ontario to the US state of Michigan, would not open until Ottawa \"treats the United States with the Fairness and Respect that we deserve\", Trump wrote on social media.According to the project's website, the bridge is being funded by the Canadian government but will be publicly owned by both Canada and Michigan.Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat, said closing the \"incredibly important infrastructure project\" would be \"awful for our state's economy\".The move could have \"serious repercussions\" she said in a post on X: \"Higher costs for Michigan businesses, less secure supply chains, and ultimately, fewer jobs.\"It is not clear how Trump could block its opening but he said negotiations would begin immediately, without elaborating.The bridge, which spans the Detroit River, is expected to open to traffic pending formal tests and approvals in the early part of this year. Construction began in 2018, but the project has been a point of contention between the countries for more than a decade.It is estimated to have cost $6.4bn CAD (£3.4bn), according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). In the statement on his Truth Social platform, Trump said that the US should own \"at least one half of this asset\". He also suggested that Canada owned both the Canadian and US sides of the bridge.The organisation developing the bridge, the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority, is wholly owned by the Canadian government, according to the project's website.Trump wrote: \"The Canadian Government expects me, as President of the United States, to PERMIT them to just 'take advantage of America!'\"\"I will not allow this bridge to open until the United States is fully compensated for everything we have given them,\" he added.He also blamed former President Barack Obama for allowing construction to begin without the use of any US steel.But Mayor Drew Dilkens of Windsor, Ontario, on the Canadian side of the bridge, told the CBC that this accusation is wrong.\"It's just insane,\" he said. \"I really can't believe what I'm reading.\"The Moroun family - the American owners of the neighbouring Ambassador Bridge that also connects Detroit to Canada - appealed to Trump during his first term to stop construction of the new bridge, arguing that it infringed on their exclusive ability to collect tolls. In response, Trump and then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a joint statement saying the bridge was a \"vital economic link\" between the countries. Michigan's Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer pushed back on Trump's threat to close the bridge, saying it was good for jobs in her state.\"This project has been a tremendous example of bipartisan and international cooperation,\" Whitmer's press secretary Stacey LaRouche told the CBC.Trump on Monday pointed to recent trade disputes between the two countries, saying that \"the Tariffs Canada charges us for our Dairy products have, for many years, been unacceptable\". Trump continued: \"The first thing China will do is terminate ALL Ice Hockey being played in Canada, and permanently eliminate The Stanley Cup.\"But Slotkin hit back at this, saying the only reason Canada was on the verge of a trade deal with China was because Trump \"has kicked them in the teeth for a year\".Canada is our friend, not our enemy, she added, promising to work to get the project back on track.Canada's bridge authority, the Ontario premier's office and the Detroit mayor's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

    "body": "Australia police defend actions after violence at protest over Israeli president visit3 hours agoLana LamandKaty Watson,SydneyWatch: BBC reports from Sydney as police use pepper spray on pro-Palestine protestAustralian police have defended their actions after violently clashing with protesters during a demonstration against a visit by the Israeli president.Video emerged of police charging and punching protesters during the rally in Sydney on Monday night, with a state parliament MP among those who said they were injured in the clashes. Police said 27 people were arrested, with nine later charged, and 10 officers assaulted.Officers showed \"remarkable restraint\", NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said Tuesday, adding they \"did what they needed to do\".Earlier, rally organisers had failed in their court bid to overturn police powers limiting their right to demonstrate during Isaac Herzog's visit.The government invited Herzog to visit Australia after an antisemitic attack at Bondi Beach, saying it would help the Jewish community heal, despite objections from pro-Palestinian groups.Fifteen people, including a ten-year-old girl, were killed on 14 December after two gunmen shot at crowds at an event celebrating the Jewish festival of Hanukkah.Video footage of the protests outside Sydney's Town Hall and surrounding areas - police said 6,000 attended while organisers said it was 50,000 - appeared to show several physical confrontations between police and protesters, including officers punching protesters and dragging away Muslim men who were praying. Josh Lees from the Palestine Action Group said the violence at the protest on Monday evening was the \"worst\" he has seen in recent years.\"We should have had the right to march,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) radio.He said \"all of this could have been avoided\" if the New South Wales (NSW) government had allowed the group to march from Town Hall to either the state parliament or Hyde Park.NSW Police and Greens member respond to force used in Sydney protestNSW introduced restrictions on public protest after December's shooting, and a few days before Monday's rally introduced additional \"major event\" powers effectively giving police authority to shut down areas of the city. The rules allowed demonstrators to gather but forbade them from marching.Protesters lost a legal bid to overturn the major event powers application just half an hour before the protest.NSW Premier Chris Minns defended the police response, telling Channel 9's Today programme that authorities had been \"put in an impossible situation last night\". He later urged the public \"not to look at a 10-second clip without the full context\".Assistant Commissioner Peter McKenna said police had been \"threatened, jostled and assaulted\" during \"a number of melees, rolling fights\" and authorities were \"significantly outnumbered by the protesters and the people who wanted to act in a violent and offensive manner\".Protesters include Grace TameOn Monday night, activist Grace Tame led the crowd in chanting: \"from Gadigal to Gaza, globalise the intifada\" - a move that has drawn criticism from politicians.The term intifada came into popular use during the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1987.Some have described the term as a call for violence against Jewish people. Others have said it is a call for peaceful resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and actions in Gaza.New South Wales premier Chris Minns said Tame's choice of words was \"terrible\", ABC reported.Tame was named Australian of the Year in 2021 for raising awareness about sexual violence.Former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce told Sky News that Tame should be stripped of her title.\"Politicians and the press can deflect onto me all they like, but I'm not the story,\" Tame wrote on Instagram on Tuesday. She added that \"nonviolent attendees acting well within their rights were met with unprovoked police brutality\".Among the crowd was Jewish demonstrator Linda Feinberg, who came to show solidarity.\"I am appalled, it was a really damaging decision of Albanese to invite him [Herzog],\" she said, holding a placard that read \"Jews say no to genocide\".Sihal Jamila came with her young daughter.\"It's very important for me to be here, I'm the mother of two and one on the way,\" she told the BBC, her voice cracking. \"They're killing our children. This is ridiculous.\"The speeches at Town Hall were peaceful, but tensions mounted afterwards when protesters began chanting \"let us march\" and police closed in.As the atmosphere became fraught, pepper spray was deployed, which sent protesters running, but they were unable to leave the area due to police lines.GettyThousands of people attended a rally on Sydney on Monday night against a visit by Israeli President Isaac Herzog.Minns said police had needed to keep protesters away from people attending an event with Herzog at a nearby convention centre.Another protest is planned for Tuesday evening outside a Sydney police station, with organisers calling for charges against protesters to be dropped and for police officers who had used physical force to be investigated.The Australian National Imams Council said the footage of Muslims men being dragged away while they were praying was \"shocking, deeply disturbing, and entirely unacceptable\".NSW Greens MP Abigail Boyd - who posted a photo of herself in a neck brace - said she was pushed and shoved by police at the protests despite telling them she was a member of parliament.\"I got pushed so hard my feet left the ground after I told them I was a member of parliament,\" she said.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who is to meet Herzog later on Tuesday, said he was \"devastated\" by the scenes, saying they \"shouldn't be taking place,\" but defended the invitation to Herzog and said protesters \"undermined\" their cause at the protest.Pro-Palestinian groups had objected to Herzog's visit, citing a UN commission last year which concluded that Herzog was among Israeli leaders who \"incited the commission of genocide\" against Palestinians in their speeches and statements.It came after Herzog said \"it's an entire nation out there that is responsible\" for the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel, and was also pictured signing a shell to be dropped on Gaza. His comments formed part of the legal case brought by South Africa in the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza.Herzog has condemned the UN report, which he said took his words out of context, while the Israeli foreign minister called it \"distorted and false\".",

    "body": "Maxwell refuses to answer questions about Epstein in congressional hearing12 hours agoCaitlin WilsonandCai Pigliucci,at Capitol HillWatch: Ghislaine Maxwell repeatedly invokes right to silence during congressional hearingGhislaine Maxwell, the convicted associate of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, refused to answer questions from the US House Oversight Committee on Monday. Maxwell appeared virtually for a closed-door deposition from the Texas prison where she is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking.Republican House Oversight Committee chairman James Comer said that \"as expected\", Maxwell pleaded the Fifth Amendment, invoking her right to remain silent. \"This is obviously very disappointing,\" he said. \"We had many questions to ask about the crimes she and Epstein committed, as well as questions about potential co-conspirators.\"\"We sincerely want to get to the truth for the American people, and justice for the survivors, that's what this investigation is about,\" Comer added. The Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution gives Americans the right to avoid self-incrimination by refusing to answer questions while under oath. Democratic Representative Melanie Stansbury told reporters after the hearing that Maxwell used the opportunity to \"campaign for clemency\".Comer said it was clear from speaking to Epstein survivors \"that Maxwell was a very bad person\" who did not deserve any type of immunity. In a social media post earlier, Maxwell's lawyer David Oscar Markus said Maxwell was \"prepared to speak fully and honestly if granted clemency by President Trump\".\"Only she can provide the complete account. Some may not like what they hear, but the truth matters,\" he posted.Watch: New footage of Ghislaine Maxwell in prison cell released by DOJIn a letter sent to the House Oversight Committee before Maxwell's appearance, a group of Epstein survivors urged lawmakers to be sceptical of any information provided by Maxwell.They criticised her for refusing to identify \"the many powerful men\" involved in Epstein's trafficking operation and her refusals to \"meaningfully cooperate\" with law enforcement, saying any \"special treatment\" or \"credibility afforded to her testimony\", would be catastrophic for survivors. The White House has previously said \"no leniency is being given or discussed\" in relation to Maxwell.Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in luring underage girls for Epstein, her former boyfriend, to exploit. Epstein died in prison in 2019. She is seeking a pardon from Trump and has been accused of lying to federal officials.Who is in the Epstein files?In a letter addressed to Comer before the deposition, Democratic Representative Ro Khanna said he planned to ask Maxwell about a court document she filed last year saying there were \"four named co-conspirators\" and 25 others who were not indicted as part of the Epstein investigation. He also planned to ask about her and the deceased financier's \"social relationship\" with Donald Trump, and whether the US president ever discussed a potential pardon for Maxwell with her defence team.US lawmakers react after Maxwell refuses to answer questionsTrump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, with whom he says he severed contact decades ago, and has not been accused of any crimes by Epstein's victims.Khanna said Maxwell's decision to not answer questions from the Oversight Committee \"appears inconsistent with Ms Maxwell's prior conduct, as she did not invoke the Fifth Amendment when she previously met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to discuss substantially similar subject matter\".According to a justice department transcript of that meeting in July, Maxwell told Blanche - who previously worked as Trump's personal attorney - that she did not witness any inappropriate conduct by Donald Trump or former US President Bill Clinton and that a rumoured Epstein \"client list\" does not exist.Monday's deposition was originally scheduled for last August but was postponed by Comer after a request from Maxwell's lawyers to wait for a Supreme Court ruling related to her case.The testimony comes as the US Department of Justice has released millions of pages of new files from its investigation into the disgraced financier after a law compelling their unveiling was passed by Congress last year.Members of Congress will be allowed to view the un-redacted versions of the nearly three million pages in person at the Department of Justice starting on Monday, the BBC's US news partner CBS reported. \"I think it's great that the Department of Justice is letting members of Congress come in and look at all the un-redacted versions of the documents,\" Comer told reporters at the Capitol on Monday.A group of Epstein survivors on Sunday released a video calling for further transparency around redactions and certain unreleased files. Blanche has rejected any accusations of a cover-up, saying previously that the notion of a \"hidden tranche of information of men that we know about\" and that the justice department is choosing not to prosecute is not the case.

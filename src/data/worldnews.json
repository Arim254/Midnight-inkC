    "body": "Can you ban kids from social media? Australia is about to, but some teens are a step ahead2 days agoTiffanie TurnbullSydneyBBC/Jessica HromasIsobel is convinced the social media ban won't stop kids like herIt took 13-year-old Isobel less than five minutes to outsmart Australia's \"world-leading\" social media ban for children.A notification from Snapchat, one of the ten platforms affected, had lit up her screen, warning she'd be booted off when the law kicked in this week – if she couldn't prove she was over 16.\"I got a photo of my mum, and I stuck it in front of the camera and it just let me through. It said thanks for verifying your age,\" Isobel claims. \"I've heard someone used Beyoncé's face,\" she adds.\"I texted her,\" she gestures to her mum Mel, \"and I was like, 'Hey Mummy, I got past the social media ban' and she was just like, 'Oh, you monkey'.\"It made her laugh, Mel explains: \"This is exactly what I thought was going to happen.\"Though she had let Isobel use TikTok and Snapchat with tight supervision – preferring that to the teenager using it covertly – she had been hoping the ban, as promised, would help parents like her protect their children from the dangers of the online world.That hope has now wavered, as a series of experts – and kids themselves – sound the alarm on the viability and safety of the landmark policy, which is being closely watched around the globe and eyed with trepidation by some of its most influential companies.There's concern about the reliability of the technology enforcing the ban, along with fears it could isolate vulnerable children and push others into darker, less-regulated corners of the web.The question nervously being asked in the halls of Canberra, in households across the nation, and in tech boardrooms around the world: is this actually going to work?'Parents are worried sick about the safety of kids online'You'd struggle to find anyone in Australia who feels social media companies are doing enough to shield users – particularly children – from harm on their platforms. Their protestations to the contrary fall on unsympathetic ears.\"We have zero faith the tech companies will do anything other than protect their profits,\" Dany Elachi, a father of five and anti-smartphone campaigner, tells the BBC.\"They've had ample opportunity to show they take children's wellbeing seriously and they've failed at every turn.\"Detailing how bullying – inescapable due to social media – had culminated in her 15-year-old daughter's suicide, Emma Mason asked world leaders at the UN last month: \"How many more Tillys must die?\"The pair were among the parents and public figures who lent their voices to a headline-grabbing national campaign calling for a new minimum age for social media.Some experts, including Australia's online safety tsar, warned banning children from social media was not the solution, but their concerns were swept away by a tide of parental passion and political pressure.Watch: What do teenagers think about Australia's social media ban?In November 2024, the prime minister announced the legislation, promising parents and children wouldn't be penalised. It'd be up to the platforms to take \"reasonable steps\" to ensure account-holders were at least 16 years old, or face fines of up to $49.5m (US$33m, £25m) for the most serious breaches.\"This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online,\" Anthony Albanese said.The policy – limited versions of which have been attempted with little success by other jurisdictions around the world – would help free children from addictive algorithms exposing them to harmful content like violence, pornography and misinformation, proponents said. It would also reduce cyber-bullying and online child exploitation. It would force kids outside, help them sleep better, improve their physical and mental health, it was suggested.Noticeably absent from Albanese's announcement was a plan on exactly how the government was going to do this – it gave itself a year to work that out.Within weeks, it had rushed a skeletal bill through parliament, after allowing less than 48 hours for the public to make submissions on the law.How will it be enforced?EPAAlbanese has charged Communications Minister Anika Wells with the rolloutA year later, and days out from the official start of the law, questions remain.A government-funded, industry-run trial looked at the main methods of age assurance and earlier this year reported all were technically possible – but none were foolproof and all carried risks.Verification using IDs was the most accurate approach, but that requires users to hand over sensitive and important documents when polling shows most Australians don't trust social media firms.Age inference, which draws conclusions based on users' online activity, and facial assessment technology both lacked the precision to be reliably applied to teenagers.For example, the accuracy of face scans – already rolled out by Meta and Snapchat for suspected underage users – falters for people two to three years either side of 16; the intended target.Still, the report found age assurance technologies can be \"private, robust and effective\", especially when layered.\"When you go to a bottle shop and they look you up and down and go, 'Mmm not really sure', they ask you for some ID… It's the same principle,\" says Tony Allen, who heads the UK-based Age Check Certification Scheme and ran the trial.Its findings weren't without controversy. Two former advisory board members levelled accusations of bias and \"privacy-washing\". And though the trial considered ways teenagers might bypass barriers, it was not tasked with testing them.Getty ImagesA facial scan is one of the age check methods offeredTips have flooded social media: everything from signing up with a parent's email and moving to platforms not explicitly named on the government's hit list, to using VPNs, which can disguise a user's location. There was a temporary surge in VPN use in the UK after it introduced tougher age checks for pornography earlier this year, and experts are expecting the same here.Polling conducted for the government in May indicated a third of parents intended to help their kids circumvent the ban, and an experiment by the University of Melbourne showed that a $22 Halloween mask was enough to defeat facial assessment technology in some cases.Proponents of age assurance contend that the technology to thwart circumvention exists. A photo, like Isobel says she used, is not supposed to fool these checks.The BBC asked Snapchat about this, and a spokesperson said the firm had consistently expressed concern about the \"technical challenges\" of enforcing the ban: \"This is one such challenge.\"Luc Delany - an executive for K-ID, which performs age assessments on Snapchat's behalf - said it was extremely improbable that a still photo could deceive age checks as they have tools to detect if the image it is assessing is live.\"It's a constant running battle to ensure that the mitigations are improving, literally on a daily basis,\" he added.BBC/Jessica HromasMel worries the ban has distracted from other meaningful online safety reformsIsobel, buoyed by her experience, says she's pretty sure the ban won't work.\"I'm not a screen addict… but I think Anthony Albanese's idea of us touching grass is stupid,\" she says, referring to the prime minister's comment about getting kids outside.\"If I do end up getting banned, I'll just find another app to use.\"That's up for discussion, Mel clarifies. But she and a host of others fear the platforms and the regulator are set for a relentless game of \"whack-a-mole\" – identifying and shutting down loophole after loophole, and listing emerging platforms only for kids to flock to another.The social media firms also have a motive to subtly undermine the policy, lest other countries follow suit, analysts say, and the vague \"reasonable steps\" outlined by the government leave the door ajar.\"They're going to try to drive a truck through [it],\" says Stephen Scheeler, who led Facebook in Australia and New Zealand between 2013 and 2017.\"It's like getting your kids to do something like load the dishwasher - they'll do it, but they won't do it well, and they won't do it with a smile on their face.\"The fines offer little incentive to behave, he says. Facebook, for example, earns that amount globally in under two hours. \"It's a parking ticket.\"Getty ImagesFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been accused by US Senators of putting profits over safetyThen there's the inevitable legal challenges. Two teenagers have already filed a case in the nation's highest court, alleging the law is unconstitutional and Orwellian. Alphabet, which owns YouTube and Google, is also apparently considering its own challenge. Human rights groups and a smattering of legal experts have raised their hackles too.While the government has insisted the social media companies have the money and the technology to make the ban happen, it has at the same time sought to manage expectations.\"It's going to look a bit untidy on the way through. Big reforms always do,\" Communications Minister Anika Wells has said.The key question is not can children get around it, Mr Allen says; that answer is yes. But will enough of them be bothered to?\"To be a successful policy, it doesn't have to get to a point where 100% of children aren't on social media,\" he says. \"It only really has to get about 80% of them and the rest will follow.\"Some exasperated parents just want to be able to say it is illegal. They don't want their kids to feel entitled – or pressured – to access social media.\"We've always said, whether the law was enforceable or not, our main aim in all of this was to establish a new social norm,\" Mr Elachi says.Will it reduce harm?Putting aside the question of whether it can be done, many are still asking: should it?First, there is concern that this policy pushes children into darker parts of the web.Will it be gaming site chatrooms, which the Australia Federal Police have warned are hotbeds for radicalisation but are excluded from the ban?Will it be sites like Omegle, which previous generations turned to when told they were too young for mainstream social media? It allowed users to video chat randomly selected strangers and was shut down two years ago over its failure to protect minors from predators. Copycats have quickly replaced it.Children can also still browse on several of the apps, like TikTok and YouTube, without accounts, a potentially riskier minefield of unfiltered content and advertisements - several platforms currently limit these on minors' accounts. \"This law will not fulfil its promise to make kids safer online, and will, in fact, make Australian kids less safe on YouTube,\" a spokesperson for the company said this week.There's plenty of criticism of big tech over moderation, but few dispute that these large platforms do it better than their smaller peers. Facebook, for example, has systems which set off alarms bells if an adult is messaging a child frequently.\"You're not stopping behaviour, you're just moving that behaviour to other platforms,\" says Tim Levy, head of online safety company Qoria and one of the trial advisers who quit. \"Telling the concerned Australian parents that it's all good now is a very dangerous message.\"The science on social media and health is complex and still evolving too. Alongside the studies linking it to poor outcomes is also evidence it can be a lifeline for some children, particularly for those from LGBTQ+, neurodivergent or rural communities.\"We've heard very little officially about what is being done to address the unmet needs of these more vulnerable children who for positive reasons have sought help or a sense of belonging and connection online,\" former children's commissioner Anne Hollonds tells the BBC.Her term finished just a few weeks ago, but Ms Hollonds has spent years lobbying the government on greater online guard-rails for kids and was surprised, frustrated even, to learn this \"blunt\" tool was the one they've chosen.What could be achieved if this regulatory effort and attention was used to pull other levers, she wonders.Many have suggested the focus should be on forcing socials to better police harmful content and limit the power of algorithms, while also preparing children for the reality of life on the web.More than 140 leading Australian and international experts signed an open letter raising these concerns, among others, before the legislation passed.\"There's nothing magical about the age of 16,\" Ms Hollonds says. \"[This] really does nothing on its own.\"Watch: Australia's social media ban explained... in 60 secondsBefore her agency was officially charged with implementing this policy, eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman-Grant made similar arguments.\"We do not fence the ocean or keep children entirely out of the water, but we do create protected swimming environments that provide safeguards and teach important lessons from a young age,\" she said in June last year.To that, Minister Wells counters: \"We can police the sharks\" – a biting reference to social media firms.Many of the critics are right about the challenges ahead, she told the BBC. But this is just a starting point – a digital duty of care, a legal obligation that firms prevent foreseeable harm to their users, is next on her list.\"For every person that says to me, 'Why haven't you included these big elements?', someone else is saying to me, 'It is impossible for you to do what you've even set out to do now'.\"\"This isn't a cure. It's a treatment plan, and treatment plans will always evolve.\"\"This is, at the end of the day, work to try and save a generation. It's worth doing.\"",

    "body": "Jeremy Bowen: Syria feels lighter without the Assads' crushing weight - but now there are new problems2 hours agoJeremy BowenInternational EditorBBCA year ago, the war that President Bashar al-Assad seemed to have won was turned upside down.A rebel force had broken out of Idlib, a Syrian province on the border with Turkey, and was storming towards Damascus. It was led by a man known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, and his militia group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Jolani was a nom-de-guerre, reflecting his family's roots in the Golan Heights, Syria's southern highlands, annexed by Israel after it was occupied in 1967. His real name is Ahmed al-Sharaa.One year later, he is interim president, and Bashar al-Assad is in a gilded exile in Russia. Syria is still in ruins. In every city and village I have visited this last 10 days, people were living in skeletal buildings gutted by war. But for all the new Syria's problems, it feels much lighter without the crushing, cruel weight of the Assads.Getty ImagesSyria is still in ruins. In cities and villages, many people are living in skeletal buildings gutted by warSharaa has found the going easier abroad than at home. He has won the argument with Saudi Arabia and the West that he is Syria's best chance of a stable future.In May, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia arranged a brief meeting between Sharaa and US President Donald Trump. Afterwards, Trump called him a \"young attractive tough guy\".At home, Syrians know his weaknesses and the problems Syria faces better than foreigners. Sharaa's writ does not run in the north-east, where the Kurds are in control, or parts of the south where Syrian Druze, another minority sect, want a separate state backed by their Israeli allies. On the coast Alawites – Assad's sect – fear a repeat of the massacres they suffered in March.AFP via Getty ImagesTrump called him a 'young attractive tough guy'A year ago, the new masters of Damascus, like most of the armed rebels in Syria, were Sunni Islamists. Sharaa, their leader, had a long history fighting for al-Qaeda in Iraq, where he had been imprisoned by the Americans, and then was a senior commander with the group that became Islamic State.Later, as he built his power base in Syria, he broke with and fought both IS and al-Qaeda. People who had travelled to Idlib to see him said that he had developed a much more pragmatic set of beliefs, better suited to governing Syria, with its spectrum of religious sects. Sunnis are the majority. As well as Kurds and Druze, there are Christians, many of whom find it hard to forget Sharaa's jihadist past.Image of a man who outgrew his jihadist rootsIn the first week of December last year, it was hard to believe that the HTS offensive was moving so fast. It took them three days to capture Aleppo, Syria's northern powerhouse.Compare that with the tortured years between 2012 and 2016, when the regime's army and rebel militias had fought for control of the city: that had ended in victory for Assad after Russia's president Vladimir Putin deployed his air force and artillery to add decisive firepower to the regime's ruthless tactics.When I visited the former rebel strongholds in eastern Aleppo a few weeks after they had fallen to the regime, large areas were devastated by Russian bombing. Some streets were blocked by rubble that went up to first-floor balconies.But by the end of 2024, across the country, government troops had melted away. Both reluctant conscripts and regime loyalists were no longer prepared to fight and die for a corrupt and cruel regime that repaid them with poverty and oppression.AFP via Getty ImagesOne year ago - celebrations marking the dawn of a new era for SyriaA few days after Assad fled with his family to Russia, I interviewed Syria's victorious new leader in the presidential palace.It perches high on a crag overlooking Damascus, designed as an ever-visible reminder for the city's citizens of the all-seeing power of the Assads. By then Jolani had discarded his name, along with his combat fatigues.Sharaa sat down in the chilly halls of the unheated palace wearing a smart jacket, pressed trousers and shiny black shoes. He told me that the country was exhausted by war and was not a threat to its neighbours or to the West, insisting that they would govern for all Syrians. It was a message that many Syrians and foreign governments wanted to hear.Israel dismissed it, however. And jihadist hardliners branded Sharaa as a traitor, selling out his religion and his own history.Watch: BBC speaks to Syrian rebel leader Ahmed al-SharaaI had packed in a hurry to report on a war, never expecting the regime to crumble so fast. My formal attire was back at home in London. After the interview one of his aides complained that I should have worn a suit to interview a national leader.His grumble was about more than my sartorial choices. It was the continuation of a long campaign that had started years earlier as Sharaa built up his power in Idlib. The campaign was designed to present him as a man who had outgrown his jihadist roots to become a worthy leader of all Syria, a leader the rest of the world should take seriously and treat with respect.A weakened IS in SyriaSharaa took power amid huge uncertainty about what he might do, and what might be done to him by his enemies. Among them were dark fears that jihadist extremists of the Islamic State, still existing in sleeper cells, could try to kill him, or cause chaos with mass casualty attacks in Damascus.Jihadists rage on social media about Sharaa's charm offensive in the west. After he agreed to join the US-led coalition against Islamic State, prominent voices online branded him an apostate, a Muslim who had turned on his own religion. Extremists could take that as a licence to kill.The reality is that IS in Syria is weak. Its attacks this year have been mostly against Kurdish-led forces in the north-east.That has changed in the last few weeks, leading up to the anniversary of the fall of the Assad regime.Getty ImagesThe war that President Bashar al-Assad seemed to have won was turned upside down one year agoAs security forces have raided IS cells, the jihadists have killed three soldiers and two former Assad operatives in cities controlled by the government, according to data collected by Charles Lister, a leading commentator on Syria, and published in a newsletter Syria Weekly. IS social media channels monitored by the BBC continue to tell Syrian Sunnis that Sharaa has betrayed them.Without producing any proof, they have posted claims that he has been an agent of the US and UK, working to undermine the jihadist project.Winning over Trump and the westSharaa's overtures to the west have been remarkably successful.Within two weeks of taking power in Syria, he received a delegation of senior American diplomats. Immediately, the Americans scrapped the $10 million bounty the they had put on his arrest.Since then, sanctions imposed on Assad's Syria have been steadily reduced. The most swingeing, the Caesar Act, has been suspended and could be repealed by the US Congress in the new year.A major milestone came in November when Sharaa became the first Syrian president to visit the White House.APTrump sprayed Sharaa with cologne, before presenting him with his own supply to take homeTrump's welcome in the Oval Office was relaxed. He sprayed Sharaa with Trump-branded cologne, before presenting him with his own supply to take home for his wife, jokingly asking him how many he has. \"One,\" Sharaa answered, as he blinked away clouds of fragrance.Away from the larking around for the cameras, Saudi Arabia as well as western governments see Sharaa as the best bet – the only one – to stabilise a country that sits at the heart of the Middle East. If Syria slipped back into civil war, there would be zero chance of reducing the violent turbulence in the region.One senior western diplomat told me that the conditions for civil war still exist. That is because of the lasting scars of half a century of dictatorship and 14 years of a war that started as an uprising against the Assads' oppressive rule and turned into an increasingly sectarian fight.AFP via Getty ImagesMany western governments see Sharaa as the best bet to stabilise Syria. His minister for foreign affairs, Assad al-Shaibani is front rightSharaa is a Sunni Muslim, Syria's largest religious group. His government does not control the whole country. In the last year he has not been able to persuade, or force, Kurds in the north-east and Druze in the south to accept the authority of Damascus. On the coast, the Alawite community is nervous and restive.The Alawites are a sect that originated in Shia Islam, with their heartland on Syria's Mediterranean coast. The Assads are Alawites.The founder of the regime, Bashar's father Hafez al-Assad, built his power on the Alawite minority, around 10% of the population. Just the sound of the Alawite accent, especially coming from a man in uniform – or worse, a leather-jacketed operative from one of the regime's intelligence agencies – used to make other Syrians nervous.Syria will not recover if sectarian killing continues. Stopping more serious outbreaks of violence in the next 12 months is the government's most serious challenge.The slow pace of justiceJust before the anniversary of Assad's fall, the UN human rights office (OHCHR) expressed serious concern about the slow pace of justice. A spokesman said, \"While the interim authorities have taken encouraging steps towards addressing past violations, these steps are only the beginning of what needs to be done.\"Some Syrians have taken matters into their own hands, along, at times, with government forces. The OHCHR said that hundreds have been killed over the past year \"by the security forces and affiliated groups, elements associated with the former government, local armed groups and unidentified armed individuals\".They added: \"Other reported violations and abuses include sexual violence, arbitrary detentions, destruction of homes, forced evictions, and restrictions on freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly.\"Alawite, Druze, Christian and Bedouin communities were mainly affected by the violence, the OHCHR said, which has been fed by rising hate speech both on- and offline.Anadolu via Getty ImagesA graduation ceremony for general security personnel last monthA big risk for 2026 is a repeat of last March's sectarian violence in Alawite areas.In the security vacuum that followed the fall of the Assad regime, the new government attempted to stamp its authority on the Syrian coast with a series of arrests. An investigation by OCHCR found that \"pro-former government fighters responded by capturing, killing, and injuring hundreds of interim government forces\".Damascus responded harshly and lost control of militant armed factions that carried a systematic series of deadly attacks on Alawites.The UN found that some 1,400 people, predominantly civilians, were reported killed in the ensuing massacres. The vast majority were adult men, but victims included approximately 100 women, the elderly and the disabled, as well as children.The Sharaa government cooperated with the UN investigation. Some of its forces managed to rescue Alawites and it has put some of the ringleaders of the massacres on trial. ReutersThe UN found that some 1,400 people, predominantly civilians, were reported killed during sectarian violence in Alawite areas in MarchThe UN Syria Commission of Inquiry confirmed it had found no evidence the authorities had ordered the attacks. But the concern then and for the future was that the Damascus government could not control armed Sunni groups that had supposedly joined its security forces.In July in the southern province of Suweida, serious violence between Druze and Bedouin communities shook the Sharaa administration to its roots. The Druze religion developed out of Islam around a thousand years ago, and its followers, who some Muslims believe are heretics, amount to around 3% of Syria's population.When government forces entered Suweida, supposedly to restore order, they ended up fighting Druze militias. Israel, which has its own Druze community that is fiercely loyal to the Jewish state, intervened. Its airstrikes included the near destruction of the ministry of defence in Damascus. It took a rapid American intervention to force a ceasefire that stopped a spiral down into much worse violence. Tens of thousands of people were driven from their homes and remain displaced.Getty ImagesA UN inquiry found no evidence the authorities had ordered the attacks in March. But the concern was that the Damascus government could not control armed Sunni groupsThe Israel questionIt is still not clear whether Sharaa and his interim government are strong enough to survive another crisis as serious as that. Israel remains a looming and dangerous presence to Syrians.After the fall of Assad, the Israelis launched a series of major air strikes to destroy what was left of the old regime's military capacity. The IDF advanced out of the occupied Golan Heights to take control of more Syrian territory, which it still holds.The Israelis were taking advantage of the chaos in Syria to weaken a country it saw as hostile, destroying weapons it said might be turned in its direction.More from InDepthAttempts by the US to broker a security agreement between Israel and Syria have stalled in the last two months or so.Syria wants to return to an agreement originally negotiated by Henry Kissinger when he was US Secretary of State in 1974. Netanyahu wants Israel to stay in the land it seized and has demanded that Syria demilitarises a large area south of Damascus.In the last month Israel has intensified its ground incursions into Syria. Syria Weekly, which collects data on violence, calculates that there were more than twice as many as the monthly average for the rest of the year.We visited the border village of Beit Jinn, which was raided by IDF troops on 28 November. The IDF said they were arresting Sunni militants who were planning attacks. Local men fought back, wounding six Israelis as the raiding party was forced into a hurried retreat, abandoning a military vehicle that they later destroyed with an airstrike. The Israelis killed at least 13 local people and wounded dozens, state media reported.It was a sign of how hard it will be to broker a security deal between Syria and Israel. The Damascus government called it a war crime. Calls for retaliation intensified.Dia Images via Getty ImagesThe border village of Beit Jinn was raided by IDF troops on 28 NovemberIn Washington, Trump was clearly worried by the raid. He posted on his Truth Social platform that he was \"very satisfied\" with Sharaa's efforts at stabilising Syria.He warned that it was \"very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria's evolution into a prosperous state\".In Beit Jinn I met Khalil Abu Daher on his way back from hospital, his arm in plaster after surgery for a bullet wound. He invited me to his home, which is close to where the Israelis were exchanging fire with village men.Khalil told me he was here with his family when the Israelis entered the village at 3:30 am. They tried to find a safe place.\"I was in my house with my children. We went from one room to another. They shot at my two daughters. One was hit, and the other died instantly. When I picked her up, I was shot in the hand.\"The dead girl was 17-year-old Hiba Abu Daher, who was shot in the stomach. They sheltered, Khalil said, alongside Hiba's dead body for two hours before they were rescued and taken to hospital.When I visited, Khalil's nine-year-old daughter was lying on a blanket on the sofa, recovering from surgery to take a bullet out of her hip.Khalil's nine-year-old daughter lying on the sofa, recovering from surgery to take a bullet out of her hipThe girls' mother, Umm Mohammad, sat with the women of the family, desperately worried about the future.\"We want peace of mind,\" she told me. \"We want to live in our homes, and we want a clinic and medical staff because we don't have one.\"We also want a doctor because there isn't one in Beit Jinn, nor is there a pharmacy. We want security.\"'We go to sleep and wake up afraid'A year after the end of Assad's rule, Syria's new rulers have scored some important achievements. They are still in power, which was not guaranteed when they took Damascus. President Trump has become Sharaa's most important backer. Sanctions are being lifted. The economy is showing signs of life and business deals are being done, including modernising oil and gas installations and privatising the airports in Damascus and Aleppo.But deals that are in the pipeline have not yet changed the lives of most Syrians. The government has no rebuilding fund. Reconstruction is up to individuals. Sectarian tensions are unresolved and could ignite again. The US-mediated dialogue with Israel has stalled.NurPhoto via Getty ImagesThe government has no rebuilding fund. Reconstruction is up to individualsBenjamin Netanyahu insists that Damascus might demilitarise a large area of southern Syria and shows no signs of ordering the IDF to pull back. Both points amount to a major violation of Syrian sovereignty. The Beit Jinn raid makes it harder for Damascus to offer concessions.Government in Damascus is centred on Sharaa himself, assisted by the foreign minister Asaad al-Shaibani and a few trusted associates. No serious attempt seems to be happening to create an accountable framework of government.Syria without the Assad family is a better place. But Umm Mohammad summed up the feelings of far too many Syrians.\"The future is difficult. We have nothing, not even schools. Our children are living in hell here. There is no safety for them. How will we live?\"We want safety.

    "body": "The US National Park Service (NPS) is removing Martin Luther King Jr Day and Juneteenth from its list of fee-free entrance days.The move is part of President Donald Trump's \"modernisation\" of the park service, which, beginning in 2026, also includes changing the parks' cost structure to favour American citizens over foreign visitors, following a July executive order from Trump.In addition to removing the two holidays that celebrate civil rights leader MLK Jr and the end of slavery in the US, the agency is adding Flag Day, which is also Trump's birthday, as a \"patriotic\" fee-free day. People who are not US citizens will still have to pay fees on the fee-free dates, the NPS said.For the 2026 calendar year, US residents will be granted free access to national parks on President's Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day/President Trump's birthday, Independence Day weekend, 110th Birthday of the National Park Service, Constitution Day, Theodore Roosevelt's birthday and Veteran's Day.Previously, Martin Luther King Jr Day and Juneteenth were both deemed fee-free entry days by the Biden administration.Under the Trump administration's new rules, US residents will continue to pay $80 (£60) for an annual park service pass. But for non-residents, the cost will rise from $80 to to $250, the Department of the Interior, which oversees the park service, announced last month. Those without a  pass will now pay $100 per person, in addition to the standard entrance fee, at 11 of the most visited parks. \"President Trump's leadership always puts American families first,\" said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. \"These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations,\" Burgum's statement continued. In May, the department estimated in its budget proposal for 2026 fiscal year that surcharges for foreign visitors would bring in more than $90 million per year.  This is not the first time the Trump administration has targeted Juneteenth and MLK Jr Day. On his first day in office this year, Trump issued an executive order banning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes from federal agencies, which led many agencies to bar celebrations of holidays seen as DEI-related, including MLK Jr Day and Juneteenth. However, the two dates remain national holidays. In June, the Trump administration held a military parade in Washington DC to celebrate the US Army's 250th anniversary, which also happened to fall on both Flag Day and Trump's birthday. The BBC has contacted the White House for comment. ",

    "body": "Man found guilty of Australian beach murder after hiding in India for years1 hour agoTiffanie TurnbullSydneyQueensland Police ServiceThe murder of Toyah Cordingley prompted an outpouring of grief across the state of QueenslandA former nurse has been found guilty of the high-profile murder of Toyah Cordingley, whose body was found on a popular tropical beach in Australia seven years ago.Toyah Cordingley was stabbed at least 26 times while out on a Sunday afternoon walk with her dog in October 2018.The 24-year-old's body was discovered by her father, half-buried in sand dunes on Wangetti beach between the popular tourist hotspots of Cairns and Port Douglas.Rajwinder Singh, 41, fled to India the day after Ms Cordingley's body was found and spent four years on the run. After a month-long trial, he was found guilty by a jury on Monday, eliciting cheers and tears from members of the public gathered in court.It is the second trial for Singh, after a trial in March ended in a hung jury.A health store worker and animal shelter volunteer, Ms Cordingley was well known, and well loved, by the local community and her death caused an outpouring of grief across the state of Queensland.Ms Cordingley was \"repeatedly\" stabbed with a sharp object and put in a shallow sandy grave with \"little or no hope of surviving\", the Cairns Supreme Court heard.Singh - originally from the Indian state of Punjab - had been living in Innisfail at the time of the killing, a town about two hours south of the crime scene. Detectives had quickly zeroed in on him as a suspect, but he had already flown out of the country, leaving his wife, three children and parents behind, the trial heard.GettyRajwinder Singh fled to India the day after Toyah Cordingley's body was found.Prosecutors alleged this was an indication of his guilt. Though circumstantial, their case would show the evidence pointed to Singh \"and eliminated others\", the court heard.That evidence included DNA recovered from a stick at the scene which was 3.8 billion times more likely to have come from Singh than a random member of the public. They also said the movements of Ms Cordingley's phone matched the movements of Singh's car in the moments after the attack.Singh will return to court for a sentencing hearing on Tuesday.",

    "body": "A water leak at the Louvre museum in Paris has damaged hundreds of works, just weeks after thieves stole priceless French crown jewels from the museum in broad daylight.The museum's deputy administrator, Francis Steinbock, said between 300-400 works, mostly books, were affected by the leak - and that the count was ongoing. Mr Steinbock told French media the damage occurred in the Egyptian department and that the volumes are \"those consulted by Egyptologists\", but that \"no precious books\" were affected. The problem that caused the leak, which was discovered in late November, had been known for years, and repairs are scheduled for next year, Mr Steinbock added.The volumes will be dried, sent to a bookbinder and restored before being returned to the shelves.Mr Steinbock described the books as \"Egyptology journals\" and \"scientific documentation\" from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. \"No heritage artefacts have been affected by this damage,\" Mr Steinbock told the Agence France-Presse news agency.He added: \"At this stage, we have no irreparable and definitive losses in these collections.\"The leak is the third major issue faced by the museum - which is the most visited in the world - in as many months. In November, structural weaknesses prompted the partial closure of one of the galleries hosting Greek vases and offices, and on 19 October, four burglars made off with jewels worth €88m (£76m; $102m), exposing glaring security gaps. The jewels still haven't been recovered, and the museum has since moved some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France.A report published in October by France's public audit body, known as the Cour des Comptes, criticised the museum's excessive spending on artwork, which it said was \"to the detriment of the maintenance and renovation of buildings.\" ",

The woman in her 20s and her accomplice, a man in his 40s, were found guilty of blackmailing the former Tottenham captain by saying she was pregnant with his child.The woman had approached Son sometime last year claiming she was carrying his child, when in fact she did not know whether that was the case, a Seoul district court heard, according to local media.She extorted $300 million won ($200,000; £153,000) from him and threatened to go public with the allegation if he did not comply.The woman spent the money on luxury and designer goods, AFP news agency reported.\"[The woman] insists she received the money as compensation and portrays herself as a victim,\" prosecutors told the court on Monday. \"But her claims do not fully match the facts,\" they said, accusing her of planning the crime \"thoroughly\".The woman's accomplice, who had threatened Son 15 times to get the money, was handed a two-year jail term for attempted blackmail.When they demanded more money this year, Son went to the police. The judge said the woman and her accomplice had abused Son's celebrity for their crime, and that Son appeared to have gone through \"intense mental anguish\" after the case was reported in the media. Son was in October named the second-highest paid footballer in Major League Soccer (MLS), North America's top-tier football league akin to England's Premier League.In August, the 33-year-old left Tottenham after 10 years of service to join the Los Angeles Football Club, marking the most expensive transfer in MLS' history.Widely regarded as one of Asia's best football stars, Son enjoys huge popularity in his home country and the region.In 2022, while he still with the Spurs, he became the first Asian to win the Premier League's golden boot award presented annually to the leading goal scorer in the league.

Police had initially thought a gas cylinder in the Birch nightclub's kitchen exploded – but the region's chief minister said on Sunday that this had been ruled out and that indoor fireworks were now thought to be the cause of the blaze.The venue, located near a popular beach, was packed with revellers who had come to hear a Bollywood DJ. Four members of the same Delhi family and 21 staff died, police said.Four people have been arrested, including the nightclub's manager, and an arrest warrant for the owner has also been issued.Goa is a former Portuguese colony on the Arabian Sea. Its nightlife, sandy beaches, and resorts attract millions of tourists annually.Eyewitnesses told the BBC of scenes of panic in the bustling nightlife area.One said that he had been outside the club on what was a usual Saturday night with holidaymakers enjoying themselves when he heard screams.\"I didn't initially understand what was going on,\" he said. \"In a bit, it became clear that a massive fire had broken out. The scenes were just horrific.\" Though the main entrance is wide, the crossing over a small lake leading to the main structure is narrow and that made it difficult for firefighters to reach the spot.The BBC saw what appeared to be melted remains of chairs, tables and plants in one corner of the club.EPAPolice believe a gas cylinder exploded in the club's kitchen, causing a blaze to rip through the venueGoa's chief minister Pramod Sawant told journalists three people had died from burns, while most of the others had died of suffocation. Six people are in a stable condition in hospital.Officials said 20 of the workers who died were from the Indian states of Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Karnataka. One worker was from Nepal.A chef who works at a nearby venue told the BBC he knew some of the workers at the Birch club.\"People from all over the country and also from Nepal work in different clubs in Goa,\" he said.\"I am really worried for some people who I knew at the club. Their phones are off.On Sunday, emergency teams were combing through the charred wreckage.An inquiry into the cause of the fire has been launched, Sawant said, and a full report into the incident will be released within a week.\"Those found responsible will face most stringent action under the law – any negligence will be dealt with firmly,\" Dr Sawant added.India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the Goa fire \"deeply saddening\" in a post on social media.A rescue operation and investigation was ongoing at the Goa nightclub on Sunday morningAbout 5.5 million tourists visited Goa in the first half of the year, government data showed, with 270,000 coming from abroad.Some opposition politicians told the BBC that stricter regulations were needed to avoid such tragedies.They alleged that newer clubs were opening too frequently and the government needed to ensure they were safe for people to visit.India has seen a number of deadly fires at entertainment venues in recent years.A fire at a three-storey building killed 17 in the southern city of Hyderabad in May, while a hotel blaze in north-east Kolkata left 15 dead a month earlier.Last year, 24 died at an amusement park arcade in the western state of Gujarat after visitors were trapped inside. An official review later found poor safety standards contributed to the death toll.here.",

    "body": "Russian air strikes on Ukraine have continued overnight, hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had a \"very constructive\" phone call with Donald Trump's negotiating team following three days of talks in Florida.Early on Sunday the mayor of Kremenchuk, a major industrial hub in central Ukraine, said the city had been repeatedly struck in a \"massive\" attack. No deaths have been confirmed so far.Meanwhile, Russia said it had shot down 77 Ukrainian drones in several locations.Aerial assaults have persisted even as efforts to negotiate an end to the war have intensified, including detailed Ukraine-US talks in Miami aimed at drafting a peace settlement acceptable to both sides.Zelensky said on Saturday that he was \"determined\" to continue working with the US after speaking to Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the US president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, at the conclusion of those negotiations. He added that they had discussed how to ensure Russia stuck to any potential deal to end the war.Hours later, Kremenchuk Mayor Vitaliy Maletsk said his city had sustained a \"massive combined strike\" on its infrastructure. The extent of the damage was unclear as of Sunday morning but the mayor said water, electricity and heating had been cut off for some.The city, which is roughly halfway between Kyiv and the frontline in the east, has been repeatedly targeted since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.The White House has pushed Kyiv and Moscow to agree to a multi-point plan to end the war but there has been little sign of a breakthrough, despite both sides engaging with the US-led process.\"Ukraine is determined to keep working in good faith with the American side to genuinely achieve peace,\" Zelensky said on X. \"We covered many aspects and went through key points that could ensure an end to the bloodshed and eliminate the threat of a new Russian full scale invasion.\"The Russian strikes in the early hours of Sunday followed a wider attack 24 hours earlier, which drew condemnation from Kyiv's European allies.In a social media post, French President Emmanuel Macron said he had spoken to Zelensky and offered his \"full solidarity\". \"France is determined to work with all partners to secure de-escalation measures and to impose a ceasefire,\" Macron added. Macron, Zelensky, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are due to hold in-person talks in London on Monday.European leaders have pushed back against early versions of the US-led peace plan and have sought to win support from the White House for their own proposals, such as comprehensive security guarantees for a post-war Ukraine, including the possibility of a peacekeeping force.Sir Keir has led the push for a so-called \"coalition of the willing\", a loose collection of Ukrainian allies who are committed to continuing to underwrite Kyiv's defence in the event of a ceasefire to deter a second invasion. He has called that proposal \"vital\" for Ukraine's long-term security.Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected the idea of such a force, saying any troops deployed to Ukraine would be \"legitimate targets\".Also on Saturday, US and Ukrainian negotiators urged Russia to show a \"serious commitment to long-term peace\".The joint statement was issued days after Witkoff returned from talks with Putin at the Kremlin which failed to produce a breakthrough.Witkoff and Rustem Umerov, newly installed as Zelensky's most senior negotiator, said they had \"agreed on the framework of security arrangements\" and \"discussed necessary deterrence capabilities to sustain a lasting peace\".",

    "body": "A protective shield covering the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in Ukraine can no longer provide its main containment function following a drone strike earlier this year, according to a UN watchdog.  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors found that the massive structure, built over the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster, had lost its \"primary safety functions including the confinement capability\".In February, Ukraine accused Russia of targeting the power plant - a claim the Kremlin denied.The IAEA said repairs were \"essential\" to \"prevent further degradation\" of the nuclear shelter. However environmental expert Jim Smith told the BBC: \"It is not something to panic about.\"Prof Smith from the University of Portsmouth in the UK, who has studied the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster, said the biggest danger linked to the site was disturbing radioactive dust.But he said that \"the risk is low\" because contaminated dust is contained within a thick concrete \"sarcophagus\" which is covered by the protective shield. The 1986 explosion at Chernobyl blasted radioactive material into the air, triggering a public health emergency across Europe.In response, the former Soviet Union constructed the sarcophagus over the nuclear reactor. The sarcophagus only had a 30-year lifespan, prompting the need for the protective shell to prevent radioactive material leaking out over the next 100 years.The IAEA said a team had completed a safety assessment of the site last week after it was \"severely damaged\" by the drone strike. The attack caused a fire in the outer cladding of the steel structure.Inspectors said there was no permanent damage to shell's load-bearing structures or monitoring systems and some repairs had been carried out on the roof.But IAEA director general Rafael Grossi, said: \"Timely and comprehensive restoration remains essential to prevent further degradation and ensure long-term nuclear safety.\"Since the beginning of December, the UN's nuclear watchdog has been assessing Ukraine's energy infrastructure as the country continues to defend itself against Russia.Overnight, Russia launched airstrikes on the city of Kremenchuk, a major industrial hub in the centre of Ukraine. As well as assessing Chernobyl, the IAEA has been inspecting electrical substations linked to nuclear safety and security.Mr Grossi said: \"They are absolutely indispensable for providing the electricity all nuclear power plants need for reactor cooling and other safety systems.\"They are also needed to distribute the electricity that they produce to households and industry.\"",

    "body": "The US has criticised the Venezuelan government over the death of an opposition figure in custody, calling it a \"reminder of the vile nature\" of President Nicolás Maduro's regime.Alfredo Díaz died in his prison cell at the El Helicoide prison in Caracas where he was being held for more than a year, human rights organisations and opposition groups have said.The Venezuelan government said the 56-year-old showed signs of a heart attack and was taken to hospital, where he died on Saturday.The US intervention is the latest in an escalating war of words between the Trump administration and Maduro, who has accused it of seeking regime change.In recent months, the US has increased its military presence in the region and has carried out a series of deadly strikes on boats it says have been used for smuggling drugs.US President Donald Trump has accused Maduro himself of being the head of one of the region's drug cartels - an allegation the Venezuelan president vehemently denies - and threatened military action \"by land\".Why is Trump threatening Venezuela's Maduro?The US State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said Díaz had been \"arbitrarily detained\" in a \"torture centre\".Díaz was detained in 2024 after being among many opposition figures to dispute the results of that year's presidential election.Venezuela's government-controlled election council declared Maduro the winner, despite opposition tallies showing their candidate had won by a landslide.The elections were widely dismissed on the international stage as neither free nor fair, and sparked protests across the country.Díaz, the former governor of the Nueva Esparta state, a collection of islands off Venezuela's Caribbean coastline, was accused of \"incitement to hatred\" and \"terrorism\" for questioning Maduro's claim to victory.The Venezuelan human rights group Foro Penal has raised concerns over deteriorating conditions for political prisoners in the Latin American nation. \"Another political prisoner has died in Venezuelan jails. He had been imprisoned for a year, in solitary confinement,\" Alfredo Romero, the organisation's president, wrote on X.He said that Díaz had only been allowed one visit from his daughter during the entire length of his incarceration. He added that 17 political prisoners have died in the country since 2014.Opposition groups have also criticised the government over the death of Diaz. María Corina Machado, a prominent opposition leader who won this year's Nobel Peace Prize but who remains in hiding to avoid arrest, said Díaz's death was not an isolated incident. \"Sadly, it adds to an alarming and painful chain of deaths of political prisoners detained in the context of the post-election repression,\" she wrote on X. Machado, a vocal critic of Maduro's government who was integral to galvanising the opposition against him, will likely be absent from the Nobel Prize-giving ceremony in Oslo on Wednesday. Venezuela's attorney general said last month that she would be considered a \"fugitive\" if she travelled to Norway. The Democratic Unitary Platform, an opposition alliance, said Díaz \"died unjustly\".Diaz's own political party, Democratic Action (AD), also paid tribute to the former governor, saying he had been unjustly detained without due process and had remained in conditions \"that should never have violated his fundamental rights\". Tensions between the US and Venezuela have become increasingly strained over what Trump has described as efforts to stem the flow of drugs and migrants into the US.US air strikes on vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific have killed more than 80 people.Trump has accused Maduro of \"emptying his prisons and insane asylums\" into the US, and designated two Venezuelan drug cartels - Tren de Aragua and Cartel de los Soles - as terrorist organisations, the latter of which Trump alleged Maduro led.Maduro has in turn accused the US of using its war on drugs as an excuse to depose his socialist government and get its hands on Venezuela's vast oil reserves. Colombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro has said the US strikes were an attempt to \"dominate\" Latin America.The US has also stationed a large naval force - its largest deployment in the region in decades - along with thousands of troops.The Venezuelan army reportedly swore in more than 5,600 soldiers in one go on Saturday, in response to what military leaders called US \"threats\". The same day, the Venezuelan government said that Maduro and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had agreed to resume Turkish Airlines flights between the two nations.The carrier was one of six major international airlines to have their landing licences revoked after temporarily suspending flights to Caracas over a US warning of \"heightened military activity\" in the area.",

    "body": "The death toll in Indonesia from recent flooding has passed 900, with hundreds still missing.More than 100,000 homes were destroyed when a rare and powerful cyclone formed over the Malaca Strait last week, bringing torrential rain and landslides to parts of the South East Asian country.Efforts to reach people in areas still cut off are ongoing, with aid having to be airdropped into some places.The Indonesia floods were one of several extreme weather events to hit Asia in recent weeks, with the cumulative death toll in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam approaching 2,000. In Aceh Tamiang, one of the hardest-hit areas of Indonesia, survivors described villages being entirely swept away by fast-moving deluges.One survivor in Lintang Bawah Village told the BBC Indonesian service that people survived by sitting on top of their homes.Fitriana said: \"There were also those who survived on the roofs of their houses with their four-year-old children, for three days without eating or drinking.\"She said around 90% of the homes in her village were destroyed, leaving 300 families with nowhere to go.One man recounted how he and his family were evacuated by boat when the floodwaters inundated his home up to the second floor, only for them to need to flee again from a nearby village.He said: \"That night, while we were sleeping, water suddenly soaked the mattresses we were sleeping on [in Gampoeng Dalam Village]. But we couldn't go anywhere else, because there was no higher ground.\"Luckily, my daughter-in-law's house was on two levels. So we climbed upstairs and that's where we survived.\"The region's governor said response teams were still searching for bodies in \"waist-deep\" mud, according to the AFP news agency. He said: \"Many people need basic necessities. Many areas remain untouched in the remote areas of Aceh.\"People are not dying from the flood, but from starvation. That's how it is.\"Indonesian media reported inmates were released from one prison when floodwaters threatened to engulf the facility, with officials saying there was nowhere else for them to be sent.Land access to two areas, Sibolga City and Central Tapanuli, remained cut off as of Sunday, with aid only able to reach them by air and sea respectively. There have been reports of looting at supermarkets in some areas.",

    "body": "A National Guardsman is on the mend after he was critically injured in an ambush-style shooting last month in Washington DC. The parents of Andrew Wolfe, 24, say \"his head wound is slowly healing and that he's beginning to 'look more like himself'\", said West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey. The family expects the Air Force staff sergeant to be in acute care for the next two to three weeks, and they feel optimistic about his progress, Morrisey said in a statement.Staff Sgt Wolfe was one of two West Virginia National Guard members shot when a gunman opened fire not far from the White House on 26 November. His colleague, 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom, died from her injuries. \"We continue to ask all West Virginians and Americans for their prayers!\" the governor said in his statement. Morrisey attended a vigil on Friday evening for Staff Sgt Wolfe at Musselman High School in Inwood, West Virginia, where the guardsman was once a student.A pastor at the vigil read a message from the soldier's parents, Jason and Melody Wolfe.\"We know that there is a long road to go,\" they wrote, according to local news outlet Metro News. \"But our faith keeps us hopeful. We remain grateful for the prayers and the support from people all over the world.\"Earlier in the week, the governor said Staff Sgt Wolfe had responded to a nurse with a thumbs-up and was able to move his toes.Police have charged the suspected shooter, an Afghan national named Rahmanullah Lakanwal, with first-degree murder and assault with intent to kill.Before coming to the US in 2021, he was once a counterterrorism soldier in a CIA-backed unit that worked with American troops in Afghanistan.Staff Sgt Wolfe was one of 2,000 National Guard members whom President Donald Trump deployed to the nation's capitol in August as part of his immigration and crime-related crackdown in Democratic-led cities. Following the shooting, Trump said he wanted another 500 National Guard troops sent to the nation's capital. The Trump administration has also cited the shooting as a reason for additional immigration crackdown measures.They have cancelled all citizenship ceremonies for immigrants from 19 countries that were part of a travel ban announced over the summer, including Afghanistan.

    "body": "2 days agoSebastian UsherBBC Middle East analystThe Iranian judiciary says two organisers of a marathon have been arrested for allowing women who were not wearing hijabs to take part.The move comes after images appeared online of unveiled women competing in the race on Friday.Around 2,000 women and 3,000 men took part separately in the marathon on Kish Island off the southern coast of Iran.Dressed in red t-shirts, some of the female competitors were clearly not wearing the hijab or any other head covering.This drew very different reactions. Many supporters of change in Iran enthusiastically hailed the images as further evidence of Iranian women rejecting the restrictions placed by the authorities on what they can wear.For their part, Iranian officials have responded to it as an unacceptable challenge to the status quo.The judiciary has moved quickly against the organisers.It is not just the flouting of the rules on the hijab by some female competitors but that the marathon was held at all that has drawn condemnation from the country theocratic Islamic leadership.Just a few years ago, the sight of so many Iranian women in sports gear participating in such a mass public event – even if segregated from male participants – would have been seen as a contravention.The prosecutor in Kish said the way that the race was being held was in itself a \"violation of public decency\". The issue of the hijab remains at the heart of the debate on where Iran might be going.Government action against women appearing in public without a head covering has varied - sometimes permitting a loosening of the rules, at others mounting a clampdown on any transgression.The mass protests that rocked Iran for months three years ago were triggered by the death of the young Kurdish Iranian woman, Mahsa Amini, who died in custody after being detained over an alleged breach of the dress code.Since the protests were quelled through force and mass arrests, some Iranian women have continued to defy the rules.That has prompted a recent pushback by the authorities.The head of the judiciary has warned of a renewed campaign against women not wearing the hijab in public.Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said that intelligence agencies had been ordered to identify and report on what he called \"organised trends promoting immorality and non-veiling\". There is clearly no end for now in the standoff between Iran's leaders and many of its own people – particularly in the younger generation – over how women are allowed to dress.",

    "body": "21 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterKaty Perry and former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have gone Instagram official after the singer posted a string of photographs and videos of their trip to Japan.In one picture, Perry and Trudeau are seen smiling for a selfie, with their faces touching. In another video, the pair are seen trying sushi.Neither Perry nor Trudeau have publicly commented on their relationship. But speculation has been growing for months with multiple pictures of the two together.Trudeau was seen attending Perry's concert earlier this year, fuelling rumours of a romance with the pop star.Perry was visiting Japan as part of her global Lifetimes Tour.The 41-year-old accompanied her Instagram carousel with the caption: \"Tokyo times on tour and more.\"Earlier this week, Trudeau, 53, also reposted a photograph of the pair together alongside the former prime minister of Japan, Fumio Kishida, and his wife, Yuko.He wrote on X: \"Great to see you [Fumio Kishida]. Katy and I were so glad to have the chance to sit down with you and Yuko.\"Thank you, Fumio, for your friendship and your continued commitment to both the international rules-based order and to a better future for everyone.\"Last month, the pair appeared to confirm their relationship after being photographed holding hands at an event in Paris.Celebrity news site TMZ published the photographs and video footage of the pair walking hand-in-hand before getting into a car. Trudeau was seen helping the singer into the back seat as photographers called out.The appearance in Paris coincided with Perry's 41st birthday and appeared to mark their first public outing as a couple.Perry and Trudeau did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.During a recent tour in London, Perry did appear to allude to her relationship status.After a fan proposed to her from the audience during a performance, the singer joked: \"I wish you'd asked me 48 hours ago.\" This was just days after photographs of her and Trudeau were first published online.Perry was previously in a long-term relationship with actor Orlando Bloom. The pair, who were together for a decade and share a daughter, separated over the summer.Trudeau, who served as prime minister of Canada from 2015 to 2025, was previously married to Sophie Grégoire for 18 years before the couple split up in the summer of 2023. They share three children.",

    "body": "Russia has welcomed US President Donald Trump's new National Security Strategy, calling it \"largely consistent\" with Moscow's vision. The 33-page document, unveiled by the US administration this week, suggests Europe is facing \"civilisational erasure\" and does not cast Russia as a threat to the US. Combatting foreign influence, ending mass migration, and rejecting the EU's perceived practice of \"censorship\" are mentioned as other priorities in the report. Several EU officials and analysts had pushed back on the strategy, questioning its focus on freedom of expression and likening it to language used by the Kremlin. \"The adjustments we're seeing... are largely consistent with our vision,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in an interview published by Russia's state news agency Tass on Sunday. \"We consider this a positive step,\" he said, adding that Moscow would continue to analyse the document before drawing strong conclusions. The strategy adopts a softer language towards Russia, which EU officials worry could weaken its stance towards Moscow as it pushes for an end to the war in Ukraine. In the document, the EU is blamed for blocking US efforts to end the conflict and says that the US must \"re-establish strategic stability to Russia\" which would \"stabilise European economies\".It appears to endorse efforts to influence policy on the continent, noting that US policy should prioritise \"resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations\".The new report also calls for the restoration of \"Western identity\", and claims that Europe will be \"unrecognisable in 20 years or less\" and its economic issues are \"eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilisational erasure\".\"It is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies,\" the document states.In stark contrast, the document celebrates the influence of \"patriotic European parties\" and says \"America encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit\".As the EU engages in ongoing talks with the Trump administration to set out a peace deal in Ukraine, some officials emphasised their lasting relationship with the US, while raising \"questions\" over the document. \"The US will remain our most important ally in the [Nato] alliance. This alliance, however, is focused on addressing security policy issues,\" German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Friday. \"I believe questions of freedom of expression or the organisation of our free societies do not belong [in the strategy], in any case at least when it comes to Germany.\"In a social media post addressed to his \"American friends\", Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that \"Europe is your closest ally, not your problem\" and noted their \"common enemies\".\"This is the only reasonable strategy of our common security. Unless something has changed.\"Meanwhile, former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt wrote that the document \"places itself to the right of the extreme right\".The Trump administration has fostered links with the far-right AfD party in Germany, which has been classified as extreme right by German intelligence.Promoting an \"America First\" message, the strategy says the US intends to target alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean, considering possible military action in Venezuela.The US also calls on an increased defence spending from Japan, South Korea, Australia and Taiwan.Democrats in Congress warned that the document could shatter US foreign relations. Representative Jason Crow of Colorado, who sits on House committees overseeing intelligence and the armed forces, called the strategy \"catastrophic to America's standing in the world\".New York Representative Gregory Meeks said it \"discards decades of value-based, US leadership\".",

    "body": "Avalanches kill eight skiers in Austrian Alps18 hours agoGeorge WrightandRachel HaganPongau mountain rescue serviceThe avalanches hit the Pongau area, near SalzburgEight people were killed in a series of avalanches in the Austrian Alps on Saturday, following heavy snowfall and dangerous conditions in the region.Five people were killed in two avalanches in the Pongau area near Salzburg, local mountain rescue officials said.Later that day, three Czech skiers died after being buried by an avalanche in Pusterwald, about 70 miles (110km) away, police confirmed.Poor conditions have led to the deaths of a number of people in the Alps over the past week in neighbouring Switzerland and also in France.\"Our deepest sympathies go out to the families,\"said Gerhard Kremser, district head of the Pongau mountain rescue service.\"This tragedy painfully demonstrates how serious the current avalanche situation is.\"The incidents in Pongau saw seven ski tourers hit near Finsterkopf mountain, killing four and seriously injuring another.In the same area, a female ski tourer was also buried and killed in open alpine terrain.Further avalanches were recorded in the region on Saturday, but no-one was injured.Following the avalanche that killed three skiers in Pusterwald, four others in the same group rescued by emergency crews. \"Emergency responders were able to locate and partially dig out the buried victims. Despite immediate rescue efforts, the three individuals were found dead,\"  a police statement said.The fatalities follow a deadly week in the alps.Last weekend in France, six skiers died after being caught in avalanches in various Alpine resorts and in western Austria, a 58-year-old skier died in in the Tyrolean resort of Weerberg.On Tuesday, an avalanche killed a 13-year-old Czech boy skiing in Austria's Bad Gastein resort.And in neighbouring Switzerland, a German man was killed in an avalanche, and four other people were injured, as they were cross-country skiing on Friday.",

    "body": "3 hours agoCaroline Davies,Pakistan CorrespondentandDearbail Jordan,Reporter Watch: Firefighters battle deadly blaze at Karachi shopping centreA massive fire that tore through a shopping centre in Pakistan's largest city has killed 14 people, including a firefighter, and rescuers are racing to find dozens more still missing.It took firefighters more than 24 hours to put out the blaze in Gul Plaza that started Saturday night. The building housed 1,200 stores and spanned 8,000 sq m (86,111 sq ft). Parts of the building have collapsed, with officials saying the debris and lack of ventilation were hampering rescue efforts.\"Almost the entire building was already engulfed in flames\", by the time rescuers arrived at the site on Saturday night, local emergency services said.Fifty-eight people have been reported missing by their families, who have gathered outside what remains of the centre, waiting anxiously for news of their loved ones. Administrators for the city have set up a desk to register the names and details of the missing.Smoke was still billowing from what remains of the Gul Plaza building on Sunday morning. Much of it has collapsed and there are concerns it could collapse further.Hassan Khan, a spokesperson for Rescue 1122 in Karachi, told BBC Urdu the fire spread rapidly because of the presence of flammable materials such as plastic foam, cloth, and perfume in the building.By Sunday evening, various parts of the Gul Plaza were charred and reduced to rubble. Rescuers told Reuters news agency that the whole building could come down.Cranes have been deployed to shift what remains of the partially collapsed building, in the hope of recovering more bodies. However, rescuers are still waiting for the structure to sufficiently cool down so they can conduct a thorough search.At least 26 of those reported missing were last seen inside the building, according to the locations of their phones, a police official told the BBC.ReutersIt took firefighters more than 24 hours to put out the blaze in Gul PlazaZain, a shopkeeper at Gul Plaza, told BBC Urdu that hundreds of people were inside the building when the fire broke out on Saturday.\"My shops were burning before my eyes. We couldn't even get the goods out of those shops. \"There are still many people inside, I have many friends who are out of contact,\" he said.Another onlooker said shopkeepers had tried to use fire extinguishers, but the intense blaze was uncontainable. Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his condolences and told the government of Sindh province, where Karachi is based, to conduct a comprehensive review of safety arrangements in commercial and residential buildings across the area.",

I will be more careful with my words and behaviour,\" Yamanaka said.He said those comments were made during discussions over personnel evaluations.However, the mayor denied other accusations, including insulting colleagues' appearance.Yamanaka said an investigation was being considered under the supervision of the deputy mayor, adding that he would co-operate \"sincerely\" if an investigation takes place.In response, Kubota insisted Yamanaka had made the comments he has not admitted to, saying: \"The mayor doesn't understand anything. I cannot accept that as an apology. I want him to change.\"More from the BBC",

    "body": "Soldiers are on standby for possible deployment to Minneapolis, a US defence official has told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. The official said the 1,500 soldiers, currently in Alaska, are an option for US President Donald Trump if he decided to use active duty military personnel, as anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) demonstrations continued in the city on Saturday.No decision has yet been made on whether to deploy the soldiers from Alaska, the official said.Minnesota officials have urged protesters to stay orderly and peaceful during demonstrations after an ICE agent shot dead US citizen Renee Good earlier this month. The soldiers are part of the 11th Airborne Division in Fort Wainwright, the official added.In a Sunday interview on CBS Face the Nation, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey condemned Trump's threat to send more troops into the city, saying the existing presence of federal ICE agents is already an \"occupying force that has quite literally invaded our city\".\"You can go through whatever rhetorical flourish you want, but when you have 3,000 ICE agents and border control come to the city, when you've got this supposed threat of 1,500 military coming to the city, yeah, that's very much what it feels like,\" Frey said.Last week, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, a rarely used law that allows active-duty military personnel to be deployed for law enforcement duties inside the US.It comes as a US federal judge issued an order limiting the crowd control tactics that can be used by ICE agents towards \"peaceful and unobstructive\" protesters in Minneapolis.On Friday, Judge Katherine Menendez ruled that federal agents cannot arrest or pepper spray peaceful demonstrations, including those monitoring or observing ICE agents. But Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a Sunday interview on CBS's Face the Nation that the judge's ruling is \"a little ridiculous\" because it \"didn't change anything\". \"We only use those chemical agents when there's violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law and order to keep people safe,\" Noem said. \"So that judge's order didn't change anything for how we're operating on the ground, because it's basically telling us to do what we've already been doing.\"The state's National Guard has been mobilised and placed on alert by Governor Tim Walz, and other law enforcement officers were deployed to Minneapolis ahead of the anti-ICE demonstrations.Recent protests in the city were sparked by widespread action by ICE in the city, and follow Good's death on 7 January.City leaders said Good was there as a legal observer of ICE activity.But the Trump administration has called her a \"domestic terrorist\".Good's death sparked protests across the country, with many people holding signs that read \"Justice for Renee\".",

Boric said the death toll was expected to increase.The most dangerous fire has swept through dry forests bordering the coastal city of Concepción. About 250 homes have been destroyed, disaster officials said.Local media have shown pictures of charred cars in the streets.Chile's forestry agency, Conaf, said firefighters were battling 24 fires across the country on Sunday. The most threatening, it added, were in Ñuble and Biobío.The fires have burnt through 8,500 hectares (21,000 acres) in the two regions so far.\"In light of the serious ongoing wildfires, I have decided to declare a state of catastrophe\" in the two regions, Boric said in a post on X.\"All resources are available,\" he added.Under a state of catastrophe, Chile's armed forces can be deployed to help.The bulk of the evacuations were carried out in the cities of Penco and Lirquen, just north of Concepción, which have a combined population of 60,000.Strong winds have fanned the flames, exacerbated by high summer temperatures, endangering communities and hampering firefighting efforts.Much of Chile is under heat alerts, with temperatures expected to reach 38C between Santiago and Biobío in the coming days.Chile has experienced a series of devastating fires in recent years, worsened by long-term drought.Two years ago, forest fires killed at least 120 people in the Valparaíso region near Santiago.",

    "body": "The Syrian government has announced an immediate nationwide ceasefire with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), taking almost full control of the country, Syrian state media says.The ceasefire ends nearly two weeks of fighting and forms part of a broader 14-point agreement that will see the SDF integrated into Syria's military and state institutions.Speaking in Damascus, President Ahmed al-Sharaa said the deal would allow Syrian state institutions to reassert control over three eastern and northern governorates - al-Hasakah, Deir Ezzor and Raqqa. It follows a meeting between al-Sharaa and the US special envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, in Damascus. Barrack praised the agreement as a step toward a \"unified Syria.\"SDF commander Mazloum Abdi was expected to attend the meeting but was unable to travel due to weather conditions, with his visit postponed until Monday, al-Sharaa said.In a televised address, Abdi confirmed the meeting and said he would share more details about the agreement with Syria's Kurds after returning from the capital. Speaking on Kurdish television channel Ronahi, he said the deal he had agreed to with Damascus included a ceasefire to avoid a broader war, stressing that the fighting had been \"imposed\" on the SDF.Kurdish-led forces established their autonomous administration during Syria's civil war, almost a decade ago, with strong backing from the United States, which armed and trained the SDF as its main local partner in the fight against the Islamic State group (Isis). With US military support, the SDF drove Isis from much of northeastern Syria and went on to govern both Kurdish and Arab-majority areas.Under the agreement, signed by al-Sharaa and Abdi, Syrian authorities will take over civilian institutions, border crossings and oil and gas fields that have underpinned Kurdish self-rule. SDF military and security personnel will be integrated into Syria's defence and interior ministries following vetting, while Damascus will assume responsibility for prisons and detention camps holding tens of thousands of foreign Isis fighters and their families.Damascus also reiterated pledges to recognise Kurdish cultural and linguistic rights, including giving Kurdish official language status and marking the Kurdish new year as a national holiday - the first formal recognition of Kurdish rights since Syria's independence from France in 1946.Kuridsh media reported that Abdi said the SDF remained committed to protecting what he described as the \"achievements\" and \"specific characteristics\" of the Kurdish-led administration in northeast Syria.The agreement also reaffirms Syria's participation in the US-led coalition against Islamic State.The deal follows months of stalled negotiations after a previous integration effort failed and comes after Syrian government forces moved into Raqqa and nearby oil facilities following an SDF withdrawal earlier on Sunday.Al-Sharaa said last week it was unacceptable for a militia to control a quarter of the country and hold its main oil and commodities resources.",

    "body": "11 hours agoNick BeakeEurope correspondent, in BrusselsIt's not yet a full year since European leaders buckled up for President Trump's second term, and now this rollercoaster ride feels it has reached its most dangerous turn yet.The occupant on the White House is dangling the threat of economic punishment over the heads of countries that are supporting the territorial integrity of an EU member, Denmark. Leaders will hold an emergency EU summit about this in the coming days. If the European Union fights back with similar countermeasures, then it risks a full-blown trade war with the US.If it doesn't take action, will Trump conclude the bloc of 27 is weak, divided and too scared to stop him carrying out his threat of obtaining Greenland – either by buying or taking it with military force?French President Emmanuel Macron says it's time to use the EU's \"trade bazooka\" for the first time. This is the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), which would allow Europe to hit back with counter-tariffs, restrict access to the Single Market and block applications for lucrative EU contracts.There is a great irony that this weapon was originally designed to combat any bullying interference from a hostile external power.They were thinking of China, not the US.In the here and now, some EU leaders are weary of the Macron approach. Among them is Italy's Giorgia Meloni, who has enjoyed a better-than-most rapport with Trump.She has spoken of a \"problem of understanding and communication\" over the recent sending of troops to Greenland by some European countries, including Denmark, but hasn't expanded on what may have been misunderstood.If the intention was to placate Trump and suggest he is absolutely right that Arctic security must be stepped up, the sight of those soldiers only seemed to provoke him into making his latest threat.Meloni's explanation of something lost in translation opens the door to a more diplomatic approach to tackling this precarious EU-US crisis.Sunday's emergency meeting in Brussels of EU ambassadors was a discreet affair, unlike the routine top level summits where the traffic stops, roads are closed and leaders stream towards the cameras to deliver their thoughts.It's not clear who will make the next move and whether Trump will take some heat out of his latest threat or in fact double down on it.EU action on something so sensitive is unlikely to be swift and unanimous.Europe has tried to placate President Trump in his second term as best they can. Some have called it shrewd, others sycophantic.But now, there's a distinct feeling he's not just pulling up the Transatlantic diplomatic drawbridge, but is threatening to blow it up altogether.",

    "body": "2 days agoJack BurgessandGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianIranian leader press office via Getty ImagesIran's supreme leader has for the first time publicly acknowledged that thousands of people were killed during recent protests.In a speech on Saturday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said thousands had been killed, \"some in an inhuman, savage manner\", and blamed the US for the deaths.A violent response to the unrest has claimed 3,090 lives, according to US-based Iranian Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), with some activist groups putting the death toll far higher. An internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to get clear information.US President Donald Trump recently urged Iranian demonstrators to \"keep protesting\" and threatened military intervention if security forces kill them.\"Those linked to Israel and the US caused massive damage and killed several thousand,\" Khamenei said, quoted by Iranian state media.\"We consider the US president criminal for the casualties, damages and slander he inflicted on the Iranian nation.\"The protests, which began on 28 December over the economy, have turned into calls for the end of the rule of Iran's supreme leader.The Iranian government has called the demonstrations \"riots\" backed by Iran's enemies.Protesters have been met with deadly force and videos of security forces shooting at demonstrations have been authenticated by both BBC Persian and BBC Verify.There has also been a near-total shutdown of the internet and communication services in Iran. On Saturday overall connectivity remained at about 2% of ordinary levels, according to cyber monitor NetBlocks.There have been fewer reports of unrest in recent days but with internet access still restricted developments on the ground remain unclear. A woman in Shiraz, south-western Iran, told BBC Persian that \"security forces are still patrolling on motorbikes to keep the situation under control, but overall things have gone back to normal\". During his speech on Saturday, Khamenei also said Iran considered President Trump to be a \"criminal\" and said the US must be \"held accountable\" for recent unrest.He also claimed on social media that \"America's goal is to swallow Iran\". Trump has not yet responded to the supreme leader and the BBC has approached the White House for a comment.The US state department said on Saturday that it had \"heard reports that the Islamic Republic is preparing options to target American bases\".It said Iran would be met with \"a very, very powerful force\" if it launched such an attack and warned Tehran not to \"play games with President Trump\".The US president said on Wednesday he had been told \"the killing in Iran has stopped\", but added that he had not ruled out military action against the country.His comments came after the US and UK both reduced the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar.Officials told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that a partial American withdrawal was a \"precautionary measure\".",

    "body": "China's population fell for the fourth straight year in 2025 as its birth rates sunk to a record low, despite the government rolling out a spate of incentives to boost them. The country's population fell 3.39 million to reach 1.4 billion by the end of 2025, marking a quicker decline than the previous year, government data showed on Monday.Its birth rate fell to 5.63 per 1,000 people – a record low since the Communist Party took power in 1949 – while its death rate rose to 8.04 per 1,000 people, the highest since 1968.Faced with an ageing population and sluggish economy, Beijing has been trying hard to encourage more young people to marry and have children.In 2016, it scrapped its longstanding one-child policy and replaced it with a two-child limit. When that did not lead to a sustained upsurge in births, authorities announced that they would allow up to three children per couple in 2021.More recently, China has offered parents 3,600 yuan (£375; $500) per each of their children under the age of three. Certain provinces are also dishing out their own baby bonuses, including additional payouts and extended maternity leave.Some of these incentives have stirred controversy. For instance, a new 13% tax on contraceptives - including condoms, birth control pills and devices - has sparked concern about unwanted pregnancies and HIV rates.China has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, at around one birth per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1. Other economies in the region, such as South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, have similarly low fertility rates.China is also one of the most expensive countries in which to raise a child, according to a 2024 report by the YuWa Population Research Institute in Beijing.But some Chinese people have told the BBC they are hindered by other factors - including the desire for a carefree life without constantly worrying about their children.\"I have very few peers who have children, and if they do, they're obsessed about getting the best nanny or enrolling the kids in the best schools. It sounds exhausting,\" a Beijing resident told the BBC in 2021.Experts at the United Nations believe China's population will continue on a downward trajectory, estimating that the nation will lose more than half of its current population by 2100.A shrinking population has economic and social implications for the world's second-largest economy: exacerbating an already declining workforce and weak consumer sentiment. With many young people moving away from their parents, there is also a growing number of seniors who are being left to look after themselves or rely on government payments.But the pension pot is running dry, according to the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences - and the country is running out of time to build enough funds to care for its growing elderly population.",

    "body": "15 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykReutersIsrael's leader Benjamin Netanyahu has convened a meeting with his top advisers to discuss US President Donald Trump's \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza, after Israel said it was not included in talks about the makeup of one of the board's lower bodies. The US on Saturday named the first members of the Gaza Executive Board - including Turkey's foreign minister, a Qatari official, former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.Netanyahu's office has since said this was \"not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy\". The Board of Peace is part of Trump's 20-point plan to end the Israel-Hamas war and is expected to temporarily oversee the running of Gaza.The exact structure of the board, which will also manage Gaza's reconstruction, remains unclear and members are still being invited.The \"Gaza Executive Board\" will be responsible for overseeing all on-the-ground work of yet another administrative group, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), according to a statement released by the White House. A second body, the \"founding Executive Board\" - which also includes Kushner and Blair - will have a high-level focus on investment and diplomacy.So far, the only Israeli member on the Gaza Executive Board is Yakir Gabay, a businessman born in Israel and now based in Cyprus. There are no Palestinians on either senior board. Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir wrote on X: \"The Gaza Strip does not need any \"administrative committee\" to oversee its \"rehabilitation\" - it needs to be cleansed of Hamas terrorists\".Israel's opposition leader Yair Lapid called the announcement a \"diplomatic failure for Israel.\"Officials from Qatar and Turkey, which have both been critical of Israel's military actions in Gaza, are confirmed members of the advisory panel.The overarching Board of Peace will be made up of world leaders, with President Trump as its chairman, the White House said.While those members have not been announced, the leaders of the UK, Hungary, Argentina, Jordan, Turkey, India, and Egypt have reportedly been invited.Governments have reacted cautiously to the invitations, with only Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a Trump ally, confirming he has accepted the role.The White House said those chosen will work to ensure \"effective governance and the delivery of best-in-class services that advance peace, stability, and prosperity for the people of Gaza\".The UK was seeking more clarity on the committee, a government source told the BBC.On Saturday, Bloomberg reported that Trump was asking countries to contribute $1bn (£745m) to join the panel.Speaking to CBS news, a US official confirmed the reports, but clarified that countries could still join on a three year membership without paying anything. Canada's Mark Carney said that he agreed with Trump's plan on principle, but that the details - including financial ones - were still being worked through. Speaking to reporters in Doha on Sunday, he made clear that Canada did not have \"unimpeded\" aid funds to cover the costs of membership.  Meanwhile, the United Nations warned on Saturday that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is \"far from over\". The UN estimates around 80% of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged and families who have survived the war are now struggling with the winter weather, and a lack of food and shelter.Olga Cherevko from the UN aid coordination office said that the delivery of tonnes of aid and the fixing of roads in the months since a ceasefire came into effect were a \"band aid\" rather than a solution. Bitter winter weather has led to further complications, destroying buildings and making it difficult to access healthcare. Israel says that it is facilitating humanitarian assistance, and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute supplies already in Gaza. It argues any restrictions are designed to stop Hamas infiltrating and exploiting relief efforts.",

    "body": "Just nowHarry Sekulich,BBC News,Guy Hedgecoe,MadridandRachel Hagan,BBC NewsFootage shows emergency workers at scene of derailmentAt least 39 people have died in a train collision in southern Spain and dozens more have been injured in the country's worst rail crash in more than a decade, Spain's Civil Guard has said.Carriages on a Madrid-bound train derailed and crossed over to the opposite tracks, colliding with an oncoming train in Adamuz on Sunday evening.Four hundred passengers and staff were onboard both trains, the rail networks said. Emergency services treated 122 people, with 48, including five children, still in hospital. Of those, 11 adults and one child are in intensive care.Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente said the death toll \"is not yet final\", as officials launched an investigation.Puente described the incident as \"extremely strange\". All the railway experts consulted by the government \"are extremely baffled by the accident\", he told reporters in Madrid.Rail network operator Adif said the collision happened at 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT), about an hour after the train left Málaga heading north to Madrid, when it derailed on a straight stretch of track near the city of Córdoba.The force of the crash pushed the carriages of the second train into an embankment, Puente said. He added that most of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the second train, which was travelling south from Madrid to Huelva.The type of train involved in the crash was a Freccia 1000, which can reach top speeds of 400 km/h (250 mph), a spokesperson for the Italian rail company Ferrovie dello Stato told Reuters news agency.Rescue teams said the twisted wreckage of the trains made it difficult to recover people trapped inside the carriages.Córdoba fire chief Francisco Carmona told Spanish public broadcaster RTVE: \"We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work.\"Salvador Jimenez, a journalist with RTVE who was on one of the trains, said the impact felt like an \"earthquake\". \"I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed,\" Jimenez said.Footage from the scene appears to show some train carriages had tipped over on their sides. Rescue workers can be seen scaling the train to pull people out of the lopsided train doors and windows.A Madrid-bound passenger, José, told public broadcaster Canal Sur: \"There were people and screaming, calling for doctors.\"ReutersPassengers were taken to hospital and advanced medical posts near the site of the crashAll rail services between Madrid and Andalusia were suspended following the accident and are expected to remain closed all day on Monday.Iryo, a private rail company that operated the journey from Málaga, said around 300 passengers were on board the train that first derailed, while the other train – operated by the state-funded firm Renfe – had around 100 passengers.The official cause is not yet known. An investigation is not expected to determine what happened for at least a month, according to the transport minister. Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the country will endure a \"night of deep pain\". The mayor of Adamuz, Rafael Moreno, was one of the first people on the scene of the accident, describing it as \"a nightmare\".King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia said they were following news of the disaster \"with great concern\".\"We extend our most heartfelt condolences to the relatives and loved ones of the dead, as well as our love and wishes for a swift recovery to the injured,\" the royal palace said on X.The emergency agency in the region of Andalusia urged any crash survivors to contact their families or post on social media that they are alive.EPAFriends and relatives have been seeking information about their loved ones on board either train.Advanced medical posts were set up for impacted passengers to be treated for injuries and transferred to hospital. Adif said it set up spaces for relatives of the victims at Atocha, Seville, Córdoba, Málaga and Huelva stations. The Spanish Red Cross has deployed emergency support services to the scene, while also offering counselling to families nearby.Miguel Ángel Rodríguez from the Red Cross told RNE radio: \"The families are going through a situation of great anxiety due to the lack of information. These are very distressing moments.\"ReutersThe foyer of the hospital close to the crash site, Caseta Municipal in Adamuz, filled with affected passengers.French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen have published statements offering condolences. \"My thoughts are with the victims, their families and the entire Spanish people. France stands by your side,\" Macron wrote on social media.In 2013, Spain suffered its worst high-speed train derailment in Galicia, north-west Spain, which left 80 people dead and 140 others injured. Spain's high-speed rail network is the second largest in the world, behind China, connecting more than 50 cities across the country. Adif data shows the Spanish rail is more than 4,000km long (2,485 miles).Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. Sign up here.",

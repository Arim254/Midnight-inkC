    "body": "2 days agoSeher AsafGetty ImagesThe Bangalore-bound bus was carrying about 40 passengers when it collided with a motorcycle on Friday A bus fire that killed at least 20 people in southern India was intensified by hundreds of smartphones being onboard, local reports say, citing forensics officials.Flames rapidly engulfed the Bangalore-bound bus after it collided with a motorcycle that ruptured its fuel tank and triggered an explosion early on Friday.Eyewitnesses said the approximately 40 passengers had struggled to escape as locals rushed to pull out survivors.Forensic experts have now told local media that the bus had been carrying a shipment of 234 mobile phones, and that the lithium-ion batteries they contained likely exacerbated the fire once they ruptured.\"The bus batteries, presence of flammable furnishings in the bus and the cargo consisting of cell phones aggravated the fire leading to the tragic event,\" CNN News18 quotes Kurnool Superintendent of Police Vikrant Patel as saying. Meanwhile, P Venkataraman, the director-general of the Andhra Pradesh Fire Services Department, said electrical batteries used for the air conditioning system of the bus also exploded and made the fire worse. \"We saw bones and ash dropping through the melted sheets,\" he told local media.The smartphones were worth 4.6m Indian rupees (Â£39,361; $52,377) and were being sent from Hyderabad to an e-commerce company in Bengaluru, broadcaster NDTV reports.Most smartphones have lithium-ion batteries, which can pose a fire risk when damaged.This is because they can experience thermal runaway - uncontrollable temperature increases - which is hard to stop with conventional firefighting means. It can also spread to other batteries in close proximity.Authorities have opened an investigation into possible negligent driving over the crash. The bus driver fled the scene. The motorcyclist is said to be among the dead.Buses are a common mode of transport in India, but operators frequently ignore safety rules and overcrowd vehicles, while the nation had the highest road accident death tolls in the world last year.",

    "body": "A suspect has been arrested after footage which appears to capture the alleged attempted rape of a woman on a train near Paris went viral, local media say. Jhordana Dias, a 26-year-old Brazilian national, was allegedly attacked earlier this month. She told Le Parisien newspaper that the man boarded the train, pushed her and attempted to pull down her underwear. Alerted by her screams, another passenger pulled out her phone to film. The  footage captures a man fleeing as the train pulls into a station. The incident has revived discussions around women's safety in France.According to French media, a man was arrested on Friday evening by transport police in Mantes-la-Jolie, north-west of Paris. He was traced there by investigators, but it is unclear how.He was not carrying identity documentation at the time of his arrest, but told police he was a 26-year-old Egyptian national, media reports say. He remains in custody.The alleged incident took place on 15 October between the Choisy-le-Roi and Villeneuve-le-Roi train stations, south-east of Paris.The video shows shows a man dressed in a black tracksuit and cap onboard a carriage.Over the sound of a woman's cries, the woman filming can be heard saying \"you stay there\" as the man appears to begin approaching her.The train then pulls into a station, and the man disembarks and flees down the platform.The woman who filmed the incident, named in French media only as Marguerite, has since been widely credited as having saved Ms Dias from a more serious attack.Ms Dias, who does not speak French, reportedly filed a complaint with police in Choisy-le-Roi with the help of her brother, who translated her testimony.The footage has been widely circulated on news outlets and social media. prompting many women to share their own experiences of harassment on public transport in France.Two other women have since told Le Parisian that they had been victims of the same man.",

    "body": "2 hours agoEthirajan Anbarasan,Global Affairs reporter and Koh EweDirect flights between India and China have resumed as relations between the countries appear to be thawing.IndiGo flight 6E 1703 from Kolkata landed in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou on Monday, carrying about 180 passengers.Flights between the two countries were first suspended during the Covid pandemic in early 2020 and did not restart after a deadly clash in a disputed Himalayan border area escalated tensions.But the two countries have been steadily rebuilding relations, and last year they reached a landmark agreement on border patrols.The Indian government had said the resumption of direct flights would \"facilitate people-to-people contact\" and help \"the gradual normalisation of bilateral exchanges\" in a statement announcing the development earlier this month.It is part of a series of developments that indicate a gradual normalisation of ties between the neighbours.In August, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China for the first time in seven years, meeting President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. Earlier that month, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had visited India and discussed \"de-escalation, delimitation and boundary affairs\" with officials in Delhi.In July, India had also restarted issuing visas for Chinese tourists.According to travel data provider OAG, the two countries operated around 2,588 scheduled flights in 2019 before services were suspended.At the Kolkata airport on Sunday evening, airline staff lit brass oil lamps to mark  the resumption of direct flights as IndiGo passengers checked in.A senior Chinese consular official, Qin Yong, told reporters at the airport that it was a \"very important day for the India-China relationship\".Passengers expressed happiness that the time taken to reach China would now reduce. Krishna Goyal, who said he was travelling for business to China, told ANI news agency that direct flights would boost trade and relations between the countries.\"Earlier, we had to change two or three flights [to reach China]. We used to go to Singapore from Kolkata and from there to China,\" he said.China Eastern Airlines is set to launch a flight connecting Shanghai and Delhi next month. It will fly three times a week from 9 November, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in India posted on X.Additional reporting by Neyaz Farooquee in Delhi",

    "body": "Argentina's Milei wins big in midterms with 'chainsaw' austerity3 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondentGetty ImagesJavier Milei won nearly 41% of the vote in Argentina's midterm electionsArgentina's president Javier Milei has led his party to a landslide victory in Sunday's midterm elections, after defining the first two years of his presidency with radical spending cuts and free-market reforms.His party, La Libertad Avanza, won nearly 41% of the vote, taking 13 of 24 Senate seats and 64 of the 127 lower-house seats that were contested.His gains will make it much easier for the president to push ahead with his programme to slash state spending and deregulate the economy.Before the vote, Milei's ally Donald Trump made it clear that the US's recently announced $40bn lifeline for Argentina would depend on Milei keeping political momentum.Milei's supporters welcomed that, though critics accused Donald Trump of foreign interference in Argentina's elections.In a nod to his North American ally, Milei told cheering supporters: \"We must consolidate the path of reform we have embarked upon to turn Argentina's history around once and for allâ¦ to make Argentina great again.\"Before these elections his party had just seven Senate seats and 37 seats in the lower house.That meant his programme of spending cuts and reforms faced various political obstacles.His vetoes of bills to boost funding for state universities, people with disabilities and children's healthcare were all overturned by opposition lawmakers.After Sunday's result, hundreds of his supporters gathered, cheering, outside a hotel in Buenos Aires where he was watching the result.\"Milei didn't have 15% of Congress in his favour. Now, with many more deputies and senators, he'll be able to change the country in a year,\" one young voter Dionisio said.\"Our province was devastated by previous governments,\" another voter Ezequiel said.\"Now, thank God, freedom has won. We want our daughter to grow up in this beautiful country. What happened in previous years is regrettable.\"Getty ImagesHundreds of Milei's supporters gathered in the streets to celebrate the election resultThese elections were the first national test of President Milei's popularity since he took office in 2023, pledging to shrink state spending by taking a metaphorical \"chainsaw\" to it. He brandished a real one during his campaign rallies.He's since cut budgets for education, pensions, health, infrastructure, and subsidies, and laid off tens of thousands of public sector workers.Supporters, including Trump, hail him for taming inflation - which hit triple figures annually before he took office - cutting the deficit, and restoring investor confidence.His critics, though, argue the price has been job losses, a decline in manufacturing, crumbling public services, a fall in people's purchasing power and an imminent recession.Juliana, who works with children with disabilities in TucumÃ¡n province, is concerned that a law to increase funding for people with disabilities - which Milei vetoed, before being overturned - could be \"in danger\" with the president's position strengthened in Congress.\"Our salaries are low, it remains the same, while other things are increasing. We still don't see a change,\" she added.Veronica, a retired police officer, has been hit by Milei's pension cuts.\"You see a lot of poverty,\" she said. \"It's very hard: for retirees, for people with children with disabilities, for young people. There's a lot of unemployment. Many factories have closed.\"Milei has also kept inflation down by propping up the peso, leaving it overvalued and draining reserves ahead of $20bn of debt repayments next year.This had caused alarm that Argentina could be hurtling towards an economic crisis.That, coupled with a poor election result in Buenos Aires province in September, spooked the financial markets that Milei's cost-cutting agenda may not be politically sustainable.Getty ImagesMilei's took office in 2023 with a pledge to shrink state spending by taking a metaphorical \"chainsaw\" to itThese factors prompted the US to step in to help. It has now offered Argentina a potential $40bn lifeline via the combination of a currency swap, buying pesos and arranging private investment.\"If he wins, we're staying with him. If he doesn't win, we're gone,\" Trump had threatened.Before this election, doubts had grown about Milei's political future due to some voters tiring of his austerity programme, as well as a series of corruption scandals that had rocked his party.This election turnout was 67.9%, the lowest in a national election in decades, representing widespread apathy with politicians of all stripes.Some voters backed him reluctantly.\"Milei has two years left and should try to do what he can,\" said Dardo, a business owner in Buenos Aires. \"I think we're on the right path, but the middle and working classes are suffering too much.\"He is sceptical the support from the US will help, saying \"we're going to have to pay for it at some point\".Others, like political science student Thiago, said they understood the need for fiscal balance but questioned Milei's means.\"There's a lack of investment in hospitals, infrastructure, in people with disabilities,\" he said. \"There's a certain false hope.\"This election result, though, shows that many Argentines remain unwilling to return to the Peronist model Milei blames for decades of economic mismanagement. \"Argentines showed that they do not want to return to the failed model, the model of inflationâ¦ the model of a useless state,\" he declared.Financial markets are expected to rally after the win: a sign that, for now, Milei's political survival has also kept his economic experiment alive - and US support in place.His new mandate gives him the power to implement more radical changes ahead of the next presidential election in 2027, when his name could be on the ballot once more.The question now is whether ordinary voters start feeling better off, or if the pain of some of his cuts tests people's patience once more.For now, it appears a significant proportion of voters are â once again â prepared to give him time.",

    "body": "Former Madagascan President Andry Rajoelina, who was ousted in a coup last week, has been stripped of his citizenship by the new regime.The order, signed by new Prime Minister Herintsalama Rajaonarivelo, cited local laws stipulating that people who acquired foreign citizenship should lose their Malagasy nationality.Rajoelina, 51, obtained French citizenship a decade ago, prompting calls for his disqualification from the 2023 presidential election. But he defied those calls and went on to win.He fled the African island nation after weeks of protests over persistent power and water shortages, culminating in a military takeover led by Col Michael Randrianirina.Rajoelina has said he has gone into hiding for his own safety, and his whereabouts remain unclear.When he disclosed his French nationality months before Madagascar's last presidential election, he argued he had only secretly acquired it to make things easier for his children studying in France.In recent weeks, he had faced demonstrations initially organised by youth movement Gen Z Mada and inspired by similar anti-government protests in Nepal, which were only exacerbated when his government responded with violence.Rajoelina sacked his energy minister and then his government - but this did little to quell the calls for him to step down.Protesters had hoped that Rajoelina would resign to pave the way for a smooth, democratic transition.Instead, he clung to power, eventually leading to Madagascar's elite military unit, of which Randrianirina was chief, to seize power.He has now been sworn in and has formed a new government, pledging to hold elections within two years.",

SSGAuthorities found two jars containing uranium in a car bootIt is unclear what isotope of uranium the men are alleged to have sought - though all can emit harmful radiation - and their intended purpose for it.As a former Soviet nation, Georgia had stores of nuclear materials following the bloc's collapse in 1991.The security of those materials has been an ongoing concern, with several serious incidents of uranium being illicitly sold in the years since.In July, the SSG arrested two people - one Georgian and one Turkish national - for attempting to trade $3m worth of uranium.",

    "body": "'No doubt' Trump wants to topple our government, Venezuelan official tells BBC6 hours agoTabby WilsonAFP via Getty ImagesTarek William SaabThere is \"no doubt\" that US president Donald Trump is trying to overthrow the Venezuelan government, the country's attorney general has told the BBC.Tarek William Saab, a close ally of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, says Trump wants to turn Venezuela into a \"colony\" of the US.Trump has accused Maduro of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organisation, which he denies, and there are fears in Venezuela that a US military build-up is aimed at removing the long-time Trump opponent from power.The US says it has killed at least 43 people in strikes on alleged drug boats off South America, and Trump has said the US is \"looking at land now\" after getting \"the sea very well under control\".When asked about the possibility of a land invasion of Venezuela, Saab told the BBC's Newshour programme that \"it shouldn't happen, but we are prepared\".He added that Venezuela was \"still ready to resume dialogue\" with the US, despite its \"illegitimate\" fight against drug trafficking.The US is among many nations that do not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader, after the last election in 2024 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair. Opposition tallies from polling stations showed its candidate had won by a landslide.But Saab said the US wanted regime change in Venezuela, accusing it of hoping to seize the country's natural resources, including reserves of gold, oil and copper.US Congress members on both sides of the political aisle have raised concerns over the legality of Trump's strikes on boats and his authority to order them.Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters on Sunday that future land strikes were a \"real possibility\", and that Trump told him he plans to brief members of Congress on future military operations when he got back from Asia.Over the past two months, the US has been steadily building up a force of warships, fighter jets, marines, spy planes, bombers and drones in the Caribbean, which it has framed as part of a crackdown on drug-trafficking and \"narco-terrorists\".Many analysts believe this is also part of a wider intimidation campaign seeking to remove President Maduro from power.The Venezuelan leader has accused the US of \"fabricating war\" after it also ordered the deployment of the world's largest warship to the Caribbean, the USS Gerald R Ford, which is yet to arrive.On Sunday, guided-missile destroyer USS Gravely arrived in Trinidad and Tobago, a dual-island nation just off Venezuela's coast, as part of the US's largest military deployment to the Caribbean Sea in decades. It is officially visiting until Thursday to conduct joint training and exercises.Venezuela's government has since issued a statement condemning what it called \"a military provocation by Trinidad and Tobago in coordination with the CIA\".Venezuela also claimed that they had captured a \"mercenary group with direct information from the US intelligence agency\", and alleged that a \"false flag attack is underway\" in the waters between Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago.A false flag operation is a political or military action carried out with the intention of blaming an opponent for it.Venezuela's President Maduro has made accusations of false flag attacks before, including a plan to plant explosives in the US embassy in Caracas in early October.Additional reporting by Ione Wells",

    "body": "An unnamed donor is giving $130m (Â£100m) to the Pentagon to help pay US troops during the government shutdown, sparking ethics concerns. US defence officials confirmed the gift, which President Donald Trump said will make up for shortfalls in paying the country's 1.32m service members, but declined to identify the donor.Trump provided a few clues, though, saying on Saturday that he was \"a big supporter of mine\" and a US citizen.The government shut down more than three weeks ago, after lawmakers failed to approve a funding deal. The Trump administration paid troops last week by shifting $8bn from military research, but it is unclear what will happen on the next payday at the end of the month.Now in its 26th day, the shutdown is poised to become one of the longest in US history.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday the US would probably be able to pay the military \"beginning in November\". \"But by November 15 our troops and service members who are willing to risk their lives aren't going to be able to get paid,\" he told Face the Nation, a talk show on CBS, the BBC's US news partner. \"What an embarrassment.\"The next military payday is scheduled for 31 October, at the end of this week.Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told reporters on Friday that the donation \"was made on the condition that it be used to offset the cost of service members' salaries and benefits,\"  and it was allowed under the department's \"general gift acceptance authority\".Trump had indicated a donation would be made on Thursday, while also declining to identify the donor, saying \"he doesn't really want the recognition\".However, the New York Times has identified the benefactor as Timothy Mellon, a billionaire and major financial backer of Trump.Mr Mellon is the heir to his influential family's $15bn (Â£11bn) fortune, according to Forbes, and was heavily involved in the US railway industry before recently becoming more politically active and donating $50m to a group supporting Trump.Before leaving for Asia on Saturday, Trump told reporters at the White House that the donor was a \"great gentleman\", a \"patron\", a \"patriot\" and a \"wonderful man\" who \"doesn't want publicity\".\"He prefers that his name not be mentioned, which is pretty unusual in the world I come from,\" Trump said. \"In the world of politics, you want your name mentioned.\" \"He put up $130 million in order to make sure - that's a lot of money - in order to make sure that the military got paid, and he's a big supporter of mine,\" he continued.The funds amount to around $100 per servicemember. The White House was able to reallocate some military research funds to make the last military payday, while lawmakers in Congress have tried, and so far failed, to pass a bill that would keep troops being paid during the shutdown.Most government workers have been furloughed, or in some cases, told to work without pay while the shutdown lasts. According to Defence Department rules, donations over $10,000 must be reviewed by ethics officials \"to determine whether the donor is involved in any claims, procurement actions, litigation, or other particular matters involving the Department that must be considered prior to gift acceptance\".Donations from non-American citizens require additional scrutiny. While unusual, the Pentagon does sometimes accept gifts from donors, but they normally must be given to fund specific projects, such as a school, hospital, library, museum, or cemetery. Critics questioned why the US military would accept anonymous funds.  \"Using anonymous donations to fund our military raises troubling questions of whether our own troops are at risk of literally being bought and paid for by foreign powers,\" said Delaware Senator Chris Coons, the top Democrat on the Senate's defense appropriations subcommittee.",

    "body": "Russia has tested the nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile, Moscow's top general has said.\"We have launched a multi-hour flight of a nuclear-powered missile and it covered a 14,000km (8,700-mile) distance, which is not the limit,\" Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov told President Vladimir Putin in a televised meeting.The low-flying experimental weapon, first announced in 2018, has been hailed as having a potentially unlimited range and the ability to evade missile defences.Western experts have previously cast doubt over missile's strategic value and Russian claims of having successfully tested it.Putin said a \"final successful test\" of the weapon had been held in 2023, but the claim could not be independently verified. Of at least 13 known tests, only two had partial success since 2016, according to an arms control campaign group.Gen Gerasimov said the missile was in the air for 15 hours during the test on 21 October. He said the missile's vertical and horizontal manoevreing were tested and were found to be up to specification, according to Russia's Tass news agency.\"Therefore, it demonstrated high capabilities to bypass missile and air defence systems,\" Tass reported Gen Gerasimov as saying.The missile's utility has been the subject of intense debate in military and defences circles since it was first announced in 2018.A 2021 report by the US Air Force's National Air and Space Intelligence Center concluded: \"A nuclear-powered cruise missile would give Russia a unique weapon with intercontinental range capability.\"However, as the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) noted the same year, Russia faces significant challenges in making the weapon viable.\"Its entry into Russia's inventory arguably hinges not only on overcoming the considerable technical challenge of ensuring the reliable performance of the nuclear-propulsion unit,\" IISS analysts wrote.\"There have been numerous flight-test failures, and an accident resulting in several deaths.\"A Russian military journal quoted in the IISS report claims the missile has a range of between 10,000 and 20,000km, allowing \"the missile to be based anywhere in Russia and still be able to reach targets in the continental US\".The same journal also says the missile can fly as low as 50 to 100 metres above ground, making it difficult for air defences to intercept.The missile, code-named Skyfall by Nato, is thought to be powered by a nuclear reactor, which is supposed to activate after solid fuel rocket boosters have launched it into the air.An investigation by news agency Reuters last year identified a facility 475km (295 miles) north of Moscow as the likely launch site of the weapon.Using satellite imagery from August 2024, analyst Decker Eveleth told Reuters he had identified nine horizontal launch pads under construction at the site.",

    "body": "The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France after a spectacular daylight heist exposed woeful flaws in the museum's security.On Friday a secret police escort oversaw the transfer of some of the remaining jewels to the Bank, 500m (about 500 yards ) from the museum, French media report.They will now be stored in the Bank's most secure vault, 26m (85ft) below the ground floor of its elegant headquarters in central Paris. The vault is home to 90% of France's gold reserves, as well as the notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci and other national treasures. Its contents are worth an estimated â¬600m (Â£520m).The \"Souterraine\", as the vault is known, was designed to withstand all attacks, according to the bank's website.The main shaft is protected by a 50cm-thick, seven-tonne door made of flame-resistant concrete and reinforced with steel. Behind this door is a 35-tonne rotating concrete turret, which the bank says \"prevents any possibility of forced entry\".Last Sunday, masked thieves used an angle grinder to smash through a reinforced window into the Louvre's Gallery of Apollo, where France's crown jewels are kept.Within eight minutes, the gang seized treasures, including a necklace that belonged to Napoleon's wife Empress Marie-Louise and a diadem of Napoleon III's wife Empress Eugenie, worth â¬88m (Â£77m).The thieves used a mechanical ladder on the back of a lorry to lift them to a first-floor balcony to gain entry to the gallery.Interior Minister Laurent Nunez has said he has \"every confidence\" the thieves would be caught.Although French ministers insist security at the museum had worked properly on the day, the Louvre director, Laurence des Cars, has spoken of weak and \"aging\" infrastructure.On Wednesday, des Cars told French lawmakers that the sole security camera monitoring the exterior wall where the break-in took place was facing the wrong way.",

    "body": "Three people have been killed and at least 32 others injured in an overnight Russian air attack on Ukraine's capital Kyiv, the city's mayor has said.Two high-rise residential buildings were hit in the strikes, Vitali Klitschko said, adding in a Telegram post that six children were among the injured.Meanwhile, Russian air defences destroyed two drones heading towards Moscow on Sunday, according to the city's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin.The latest Russian bombardment comes as Moscow has stepped up attacks on civilian targets and energy infrastructure ahead of winter, with Ukrainian authorities saying nearly 1,200 drones have been launched in the past week alone.Officials in Kyiv said the three people were killed when a drone struck a nine-storey residential building in the Desnianskyi district to the north-west of the city, with 24 others injured in the same attack.Damage was also reported to at least three other residential buildings in Kyiv. Seven people including two children are being treated in hospital, officials said.Russia's full-scale invasion began in 2022, and it currently controls around a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014.There has been marginal movement along the front lines as fighting on the ground continues, while Ukraine has sought to hurt Russia's warfighting ability by striking its military production plants and oil facilities that are essential to its economy.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has recently called on allies to supply his armed forces with long range weapons to continue doing so.However, he came away from a recent meeting at the White House and subsequent EU summit empty-handed.US President Donald Trump did announce new sanctions targeting Russia's largest oil companies this week - the first time he had done so in his current term - as did the EU.Trump said that talks with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin \"don't go anywhere\" as he shelved plans for the two to meet in Budapest over the war in Ukraine.On his way to Asia over the weekend, Trump said he had a \"great relationship\" with Putin but that recent events had been \"disappointing\", suggesting a meeting between the two was conditional on a peace deal being likely. Trump has appeared increasingly frustrated with Russian conditions for bringing the war to a close, with a summit in Alaska in August failing to yield any tangible results.The US president had previously said fresh sanctions on Moscow were contingent on European allies cutting their Russian energy imports. The EU has pledged to do so by 2028.Zelensky has agreed to a US proposal to cease fighting along the current front lines so peace negotiations can begin - though this falls short of Russian demands that Ukrainian forces completely withdraw from the eastern Donbas region.However, senior Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who met US officials in Washington on Friday and Saturday, told CNN that he believed Russia, Ukraine and the US were close to a diplomatic solution to end the war.\"It's a big move by President Zelensky to already acknowledge that it's about battle lines,\" Dmitriev said.\"You know, his previous position was that Russia should leave completely so actually, I think we are reasonably close to a diplomatic solution that can be worked out.\"Meanwhile, Russia said it conducted a test of an experimental nuclear-powered missile on Sunday, which has been hailed as having a potentially unlimited range and the ability to evade missile defences.",

    "body": "Hurricane Melissa is forecast to become a rare category five storm as it turns towards Jamaica, bringing life-threatening flash flooding and landslides.The cyclone, which had winds of up to 120 mph (195 km/h) as of 06:00 GMT, is currently turning north-west in the Caribbean and is expected to make landfall by Tuesday, according to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC).It warns of power cuts and damage to infrastructure as Melissa brings up to 30 inches (76cm) of rain and sea level surges as high as 13ft (4m) above ground. \"Seek shelter now,\" residents have been told.Melissa is the 13th hurricane in this year's Atlantic season, which typically ends in November.A category five hurricane is the strongest type, with winds of at least 157mph. While Melissa is set to weaken to a category four before reaching Jamaica, the NHC said there was \"very little practical difference in the overall impacts\" upon landfall, and that the hurricane will be \"at least that intensity\" when it hits the island.With tropical storm-strength winds and rain already expected well before it passes over central Jamaica - including potentially the capital, Kingston - it warns that \"preparations should be rushed to completion\".\"A multi-day period of damaging winds and heavy rainfall have begun and will cause catastrophic and life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides,\" the meteorological agency urged residents. It also said the storm is moving slowly - at 5mph - which is causing more damage. \"This extreme rainfall potential, owing to the slow motion, is going to create a catastrophic event here for Jamaica,\" said NHC deputy director Jamie Rhome.Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said: \"I know that there are many Jamaicans who are anxious, who are very concerned, and rightfully so: you should be concerned.\"But the best way to address anxiety and any nervousness and concern is to be prepared.\"Residents are being told to secure their homes with sandbags and wooden boards, and to stock up on essentials.Warnings are also in effect parts of Haiti including the capital, Port au Prince, the Dominican Republic and eastern Cuba, where Melissa is anticipated to bring similar effects by the middle of next week.Landslides already being caused by the hurricane have already killed two in Haiti, the nation's Civil Protection agency has said.Melissa is forecast to pass over Cuba by Wednesday before moving through the Antillas Mayores and out into the Atlantic.By the time it reaches Cuba, it is predicted to have weakened to a category three  storm.While it is hard to link individual weather events to climate change, scientists say it is making weather phenomena more common and more severe.Warmer oceans produce more moisture in the air, helping fuel the formation of hurricanes.Ahead of the start of this year's Atlantic hurricane season, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted above-normal activity, citing warmer seas and potential stronger monsoon activity around West Africa - where Atlantic storms often form.",

    "body": "9 hours agoDamian Zane and Danai Nesta KupembaSudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) says it has taken control of the western city of el-Fasher, marking a turning point in the civil war.The group said in a statement on social media that it had seized el-Fasher \"from the grip of mercenaries and militias allied with the terrorist army\".The loss would be a huge blow to the Sudanese army as el-Fasher is its last remaining foothold in the Darfur region, leaving the RSF effectively in control of the area. The army has yet to comment.It comes after the rebel group announced the capture of the army's 6th Division Headquarters, saying that it had destroyed \"huge military vehicles\" and taken military equipment.BBC Verify has confirmed the authenticity of videos circulating on social media that show RSF fighters inside the army base.Local pro-army fighters, the Popular Resistance, accused the RSF of running a \"media disinformation campaign\" to undermine the \"high morale of the forces\".The RSF has surrounded el-Fasher for the last 18 months, with army positions and civilians under frequent bombardment. An estimated 300,000 people have been trapped by the fighting.Medics under siege: 'We feared this photo would be our last'A simple guide to the war in SudanIn August, satellite imagery showed a series of extensive earthen walls being constructed around the city, aimed at trapping people inside.The RSF have been steadily advancing towards the 6th Infantry Division command - widely regarded as the army headquarters in the city - from several directions for weeks. There are still some parts of el-Fasher under the control of the army and allied armed groups - but those are not expected to hold out for long now. UN Relief Chief Tom Fletcher said on Sunday that he was \"deeply alarmed\" by the reports from el-Fasher, and called for an immediate ceasefire across Darfur and the rest of Sudan.\"Hundreds of thousands of civilians are trapped and terrified - shelled, starving, and without access to food, healthcare, or safety,\" Mr Fletcher said in a statement, adding that intensified attacks had made it \"impossible\" to get aid into the city.Hunger and disease has spread across El-Fasher as residents contend with constant bombardment and dwindling food and medical supplies.UN investigators have accused the RSF of committing numerous crimes against humanity during the siege. The US has said the RSF has committed genocide against Darfur's non-Arab population.Sudan has been ravaged by conflict since 2023, after top commanders of the RSF and Sudanese army fell out and a vicious power struggle ensued. More than 150,000 people have died across the country and about 12 million have fled their homes, creating one of the worst humanitarian crises.The army controls most of the north and the east, with el-Fasher being until now the last major urban centre in Darfur still held by government forces and its allies.The RSF controls almost all of Darfur and much of the neighbouring Kordofan region.The group has previously said that it hopes to form a rival government in al-Fasher when it assumes complete control.Additional reporting by Peter Mwai",

    "body": "3 hours agoPaul Njie,BBC Africa, Garoua, Cameroon and Seher AsafReutersSupporters of opposition candidate Issa Tchiroma Bakary have been protesting in several cities in Cameroon At least four people have been killed during protests in Cameroon's economic capital of Douala, authorities say, ahead of the official announcement of results in a highly-contested presidential election.The regional governor, Samuel DieudonnÃ© Diboua, said police posts had come under attack and security forces had defended themselves.Hundreds of supporters of opposition presidential candidate, Issa Tchiroma Bakary, defied a ban to hold protests in several cities, clashing with security forces. Tchiroma Bakary has insisted he won the presidential election held on 12 October, challenging incumbent President Paul Biya's 43-year-old hold on power. The ruling CPDM party has dismissed the claims.Diboua condemned the deadly protests that he described as \"premeditated acts of violence\" and a serious attack on public order and national security.\"Four people unfortunately lost their lives,\" he said, adding that several members of the security forces were also injured.\"Investigations have been opened, so that light can be shed on these unfortunate incidents,\" he added, while threatening to take action against the instigators.In Tchiroma Bakary's stronghold of Garoua, a city in the north of the country, police fired tear gas and water cannons at his supporters.The protesters were denouncing what they said was a plan by the ruling party, the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM), to \"steal the victory\" from the opposition leader. The demonstrations came after Tchiroma Bakary called on his supporters in the country and the diaspora to march peacefully to \"liberate Cameroon\". Authorities have banned gatherings until Monday, when Cameroon's constitutional council is set to announce the results. In Garoua, the demonstrations began peacefully but quickly turned rowdy when security forces threw teargas on the streets to disperse the hundreds of people that had gathered in support of Tchiroma Bakary. \"We are not here for disorder. We're demanding the truth of the ballot,\" a placard read. One protester was seen carrying a banner urging US President Donald Trump to help them.\"We are here to claim our victory. We are making a peaceful march, which is a civil right for all Cameroonians - for everyone,\" another protester said. Supporters also took to the streets in the south-western city of Douala. \"We want Tchiroma, we want Tchiroma,\" protesters chanted, Reuters news agency reports.Michel Mvondo/BBCThe protests came after Tchiroma Bakary called on his supporters to march peacefully following the presidential elections Tchiroma Bakary previously told the BBC that he would not accept a stolen vote. He said his team had compiled the overall picture based on results from individual polling stations. In a video statement posted on social media, Tchiroma Bakary said he had won the election with about 55% of the vote, based on what he said were returns representing 80% of the electorate.The 76-year-old former government minister broke ranks with Biya, 92, who is seeking another term after 43 years in power.CPDM has dismissed Tchiroma Bakary's victory claims and several officials have described it as illegal because only the constitutional council can proclaim official results.Opposition supporters have alleged that the 12 October poll was marred by irregularities, including ballot-stuffing.Judges on the constitutional council dismissed eight petitions, citing insufficient evidence of irregularities or a lack of jurisdiction to annul results.Tchiroma Bakary refused to file complaints with the council, whose judges have been appointed by Biya, choosing instead to declare himself the \"legal and legitimate president\".Born in Garoua, Tchiroma Bakary trained as an engineer in France before returning to Cameroon to work for the national railway company.In 1984, he was thrown in jail, accused of being involved in an attempt to depose President Biya. Despite denying the allegation and never being convicted, Tchiroma Bakary spent six years in prison. He also served as communications minister from 2009 to 2019.In this role and as the government's spokesperson, he resolutely defended Biya's government during crises such as the Boko Haram insurgency, when the army was accused of killing civilians.But in June, just four months before the general election, Tchiroma Bakary changed course dramatically, resigning from the government and announcing he would run against Biya for the presidency.",

    "body": "2 days agoJames ChaterReutersQueen Sirikit, the mother of Thailand's King Vajiralongkorn, has died aged 93. She passed away \"peacefully\" in a Bangkok hospital at 21:21 local time (14:21 GMT) on Friday, according to the Thai Royal Household Bureau.Sirikit had \"suffered several illnesses\" while in hospital since 2019, including a blood infection this month, it added.For more than six decades, Queen Sirikit was married to Thailand's longest-reigning monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died in 2016. In their globe-trotting heyday, she was seen as a style icon.King Vajiralongkorn has ordered that the Thai Royal Household Bureau organise a royal funeral, the statement added.Queen Sirikit's body will lie in state at the Grand Palace's Dusit Thorne Hall in Bangkok, it said.Thai royal family members will also observe a year of mourning.ReutersGetty ImagesQueen Sirikit (centre) married the late Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej (right) in 1950As a young queen, Sirikit was regarded as a fashion iconQueen Sirikit met her future husband, King Bhumibol, while studying music in Paris, where her father was at the time stationed as Thai ambassador to France.\"It was hate at first sight,\" she said in a 1980 BBC documentary about the Thai monarchy, Soul of a Nation, adding that he had arrived late to their first meeting. \"He said he would arrive at four o'clock in the afternoon. He arrived at seven o'clock, kept me standing there, practising curtsy and curtsy,\" she said.The couple married on 28 April 1950, just a week before King Bhumibol was crowned in Bangkok.As a young couple in the 1960s, Queen Sirikit and King Bhumibol travelled around the world, meeting famous faces including US President Dwight Eisenhower, the late Queen Elizabeth II and Elvis Presley.During that decade, she frequently made international best-dressed lists.In the rare 1980 interview with the BBC, she also described the relationship between the monarchy and people in Thailand, which continues to observe strict lese-majeste laws forbidding insult of the monarchy. She said: \"Kings and queens of Thailand have always been in close contact with the people and they usually regard the king as the father of the nation.\"That is why we do not have much private life, because we are considered father and mother of the nation.\"She was seen as a key maternal figure for the country, with her birthday, 12 August, marked as Mother's Day since 1976.In 2008, she attended the funeral of an anti-government protester killed in violent clashes with police. Queen Sirikit suffered a stroke in 2012, after which she was rarely seen in public.She is survived by her son and three daughters. ",

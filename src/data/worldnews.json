    "body": "55 minutes agoFrank GardnerSecurity correspondentGetty ImagesRussia's full-scale war on Ukraine will soon enter its fifth year. Mysterious incidents of so-called \"hybrid warfare\" are mounting in Europe, increasing tensions. And in the UK, military chiefs have warned we must prepare for war if we want to avoid it. But if the unthinkable happened, and war with Russia broke out, could the UK fight for more than just a few weeks?Listen to Frank reading this article\"We are not planning to go to war with Europe. But if Europe wants to, and starts, we are ready right now.\" So said Russian President Vladimir Putin on 2 December, accusing European countries of hindering US efforts to bring peace in Ukraine.To be clear, it is extremely unlikely that the UK would ever find itself in a war with Russia on its own, unsupported by Nato allies. But Putin's words were an uncomfortable reminder that a war between Russia and Nato countries, including the UK, was not as remote as people hoped.How war could look in the tech-age\"Well that's odd. I've got no signal on my phone.\" \"Me neither. I'm offline. What's going on?\" That scenario, hypothetically, is just one way we could know that a war with Russia had begun, or was about to. (I should add that there can also be other, perfectly benign, reasons for a loss of signal.)That signal interruption could be followed by an inability to make bank payments for essentials like food and fuel. Food distribution would be disrupted, electricity supplies compromised.AFP via Getty Images'We are not planning to go to war with Europe. But if Europe wants to, and starts, we are ready right now,' Putin has saidThere are many ways of fighting a war, and not just the physically destructive wave of drones, bombs and missiles so tragically familiar to the citizens of Ukraine.Our modern, tech-driven society is highly dependent on the network of undersea cables and pipelines that connect the UK to the rest of the world, carrying data, financial transactions and energy. Covert activity by Russian spy vessels, such as the Yantar, is widely believed to have scoped out these cables for potential sabotage in a time of war, which is why the Royal Navy has recently invested in a fleet of underwater drones equipped with integrated sensors.In a war, these hidden, unseen actions, combined with an almost inevitable attempt to \"blind\" Western satellites in space, would seriously hamper the UK's ability to fight, as well as potentially wreaking havoc on civil society.Getty ImagesIn the UK, military chiefs have warned we must prepare for war if we want to avoid itAt a recent conference in London entitled Fighting the Long War, organised by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), a Whitehall think tank, military and political figures came together to discuss whether the UK's current armed forces would be in a position to sustain a protracted conflict before they ran out of everything from troops, to ammunition to spare parts.\"There remains little evidence that the UK has a plan to fight a war lasting more than a few weeks,\" argues Rusi's Hamish Mundell. \"Medical capacity is limited. Reserve regeneration pipelines are slow… The British plan for mass casualty outcomes appears to be based on not taking casualties.\" With classic British understatement, he says: \"This could be considered an optimistic planning assumption.\"He adds that to fight a long war you need proper back-up. \"It demands a second and even third echelon; personnel, platforms and logistics chains that can absorb losses and continue the fight. Yet this depth is notably absent from current British force design.\"Russia's 'low quality' army\"There are shortfalls in ammunition, artillery, vehicles, air defence, and people, with limited to no ability to regenerate units or casualties,\" says Justin Crump, CEO of Sibylline, a private intelligence company.Two of the biggest military lessons to come out of the Ukraine war are firstly, that drones are now integral to modern warfare, at every level, and secondly, that \"mass\", or sheer volume of personnel and military hardware, matters.Getty Images'There are shortfalls in ammunition, artillery, vehicles, air defence, and people, with limited to no ability to regenerate units or casualties,' says Justin CrumpRussia's army is generally of a very low quality. Its soldiers are poorly equipped, poorly led and poorly fed. Their life expectancy in the deadly \"drone zone\" of eastern Ukraine is short. UK Defence Intelligence estimates that since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022 Russia's army has suffered more than 1.1 million casualties – that is killed, wounded, captured or missing. Even conservative estimates put the number of Russians killed at 150,000. Ukraine has also suffered catastrophic casualties but numbers are hard to ascertain.But Russia has been able to draw on such a massive pool of manpower that it has so far been able to replace its estimated 30,000 monthly battlefield casualties with fresh blood. Russia's economy has also been on a war footing for more than three years now: an economist has been placed in charge of the Defence Ministry, while its factories churn out ever more supplies of drones, missiles and artillery shells. According to a recent report by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, Russia has been producing each month around 150 tanks, 550 infantry fighting vehicles, 120 Lancet drones and more than 50 artillery pieces.The UK, and most of its Western allies, are simply not anywhere near this point. EPA/ShutterstockUkraine has suffered catastrophic casualties but numbers are hard to ascertainAnalysts say it would take years for Western Europe's factories to come close to matching Russia's mass-production of weapons.\"The land war in Ukraine has shown beyond doubt that mass is absolutely vital for anybody that is going to face Russia on land,\" says Keir Giles, a Russia expert at Chatham House think tank. \"And having deep reserves vastly greater in number than the standing regular armed forces has been shown to be essential.\"How national service conversations backfiredFrance and Germany have both recently moved to revive a system of voluntary military service for 18-year-olds. The UK's former Head of the Army, Gen Sir Patrick Sanders, suggested in 2024, the year he retired, that the UK should train what he called \"a citizen army\" to fight a land war in the future. The idea was shot down by No. 10.\"I think it's a cultural thing within the UK,\" says Ed Arnold, senior research fellow at Rusi. \"So if you look at the states that are now looking towards [military service] - like Sweden, Germany and France - they are states who culturally still have an institutional memory of when they had that system. \"We haven't had national service since the 1960s and attempts to have that national conversation around it have pretty much backfired.\"AFP via Getty ImagesFrance has recently moved to revive a system of voluntary military service for 18-year olds\"The reality is, our armed forces cannot survive on a diet of government spin, over-the-horizon spending commitments and hollow rhetoric,\" Sir Ben Wallace, who was Defence Secretary in the Conservative government from 2019 to 2023, told the BBC.Responding to this, a spokesperson for the current Labour Defence Secretary, John Healey, told me: \"This characterisation is baseless. \"We increased defence spending by £5bn this year alone, signed 1,000 major contracts since the election and increased MOD spending with British businesses by 6% above inflation in the last year.\"He points to a new defence agreement with Norway, a £300m new investment in the Royal Navy's laser weapon and a £9bn investment into armed forces housing, adding: \"We're a government investing in the transformation of our forces, investing in our British service personnel... to create jobs and growth in Britain's communities.\"Getty ImagesGermany has also introduced voluntary military service for 18 year-oldsBut this is not about party politics. It's about whether UK defence has been under-funded for so long that it has now reached the point where the country is dangerously vulnerable in several areas, notably air defence.There are also problems of timing and inefficiency. Defence contracts often take years to come to fruition. Billions of pounds have been spent on Ajax, an overdue armoured vehicle project still beset with problems. Meanwhile, Nato officers have been warning Russia could be in a position to launch an attack on a Nato country within three to five years.At the end of the Cold War (between Nato and the Soviet Union) in 1990, when I was a young infantry Captain in the Army Reserves, the UK was spending 4.1% of GDP on defence. The following year it deployed over 45,000 troops to help evict Iraq President Saddam Hussein's invading army from Kuwait in operation Desert Storm. More from InDepthToday, with multiple pressures on the economy, the government is striving to meet a target of 2.5% of GDP by 2027, while Russia spends close to 7%.On paper, the British Army numbers around 74,000 but Rusi's Ed Arnold points out that once you subtract medically non-deployable soldiers, defence attaches around the world and others not part of formed units, then its actual deployable strength is only 54,000. That is less than the average number of casualties Russia takes in two months in Ukraine.In the event of a war, says Justin Crump of Sibylline, on land the (British) Army would most likely be degraded – incapable of fighting effectively - within weeks, once committed, though he adds \"much depends on the form of the conflict\".Suggestions the UK is already 'at war'Some commentators have suggested that the UK is already \"at war\" with Russia. They are referring to what is known as \"hybrid\" or \"grey-zone\" warfare, which includes events that are often deniable, such as cyber-attacks, disinformation and the alleged launching of drones close to airports and military bases in Nato countries.But worrying as these are, they pale compared to the crisis that would be triggered by a Russian military attack on a Nato country, especially if it involved seizing territory and people being killed.Getty ImagesA Eurofighter TyphoonThere are several potential flashpoints here, where Nato military chiefs fear that Putin, if he were allowed to achieve his aims in Ukraine, could eventually move on to seek new targets for aggression.One potential target is the Suwalki Gap, a 60-mile (100km) stretch of border between Poland and Lithuania, both Nato countries. This is all that separates Russian ally Belarus from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic coast. Seizing that border and opening up a route along it would, in theory, give Moscow direct access to its strategic base on the Baltic.The Baltic states themselves are other potential flashpoints. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were all once part of the Soviet Union and were ruled from Moscow. They all voted for independence and have since joined Nato, but all have Russian-speaking minorities and hence there is a risk that Mr Putin could be tempted to send his troops across the border \"to protect them from persecution\".The eastern Estonian town of Narva, for example, is an obvious potential target here, as the majority of its population speak Russian and it sits just across the river from the giant Russian fortress of Ivangorod. A UK battle group comprising some 900 British military personnel has been stationed in Estonia, about 80 miles west of Narva, since 2017. AFP via Gettty ImagesThe eastern Estonian town of Narva sits just across the river from the giant Russian fortress of IvangorodIn the event of war, the plan goes, it would be hurriedly reinforced to brigade strength of around 3,000 or more.Another possible flashpoint is the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, which is administered by Norway but where Moscow already has a toehold in the coal mining town of Barentsburg.Litvinenko, Skripal and hostile acts on UK soilThe UK may well be Putin's enemy number one, having been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies, and having pushed for more powerful weapons to be delivered to help its defence.Hostile acts on UK soil that have been linked to President Putin include the murder with radioactive Polonium-210 of former KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 - a public inquiry concluded that Putin \"probably\" approved his assassination - and the attempted murder of former Russian military intelligence officer turned MI6 agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018, using the nerve agent, Novichok.Dawn Sturgess, a mother-of-three, later died after she sprayed the Novichok, disguised as perfume, on her wrists. Putin was \"morally responsible\" for her death, an inquiry concluded last week. Lord Anthony Hughes, the inquiry chair, said: \"I have concluded that the operation to assassinate Sergei Skripal must have been authorised at the highest level, by President Putin.\"Russia, which has always denied involvement in the attacks and suggested more than 20 different possible explanations for Ms Sturgess's death, described the report's findings as \"tasteless fairy tales\".Sputnik/ AFP via Getty ImagesPutin accused European countries of hindering US efforts to bring peace in UkraineBut the UK is also a core member of the Nato alliance. While questions are certainly raised in private over the reliability of the current US administration in the White House, it is hard to envisage the UK ever having to fight Russia on its own.\"A pure UK-Russia conflict is not likely and can be disregarded, practically,\" says Mr Crump. \"We would definitely fight with allies, although Russia would most likely only launch a conflict if it felt Nato would break.\"The wild card here is US President Donald Trump. While the chairman of Nato's Military Committee, Adm Cavo Dragone recently assured me that the US president was absolutely committed to defending the Nato alliance, others are not so sure. Would Trump, for example, go to war to defend the Estonian town of Narva?Getty ImagesIt is extremely unlikely that the UK would ever find itself in a war with Russia on its own, unsupported by Nato allies\"There is no one-size-fits-all answer to what the United Kingdom is actually capable of,\" concludes Keir Giles of Chatham House, \"because there are so many different situations under which it could be challenged by Russia.\"As a society, the UK – unlike Poland, Finland and the Baltic States – is unquestionably not ready for war. Even serious preparations for such an eventuality would be both expensive, unpopular and politically risky.But Mr Giles of Chatham House offers some sobering advice to the British public: \"Recognise that the rights and freedoms and prosperity that they take for granted are in fact under threat and that freedom does not come for free.\"\"And understand that lives will have to change. And this is not the fault of the current government or even its predecessors — it's their fault that it is so expensive, but the root cause of the problem is in Moscow.\"Top image credit: Ministry of Defence /PA Wire/ Getty Images.

    "body": "Jeremy Bowen: Syria feels lighter without the Assads' crushing weight - but now there are new problems2 days agoJeremy BowenInternational EditorBBCA year ago, the war that President Bashar al-Assad seemed to have won was turned upside down.A rebel force had broken out of Idlib, a Syrian province on the border with Turkey, and was storming towards Damascus. It was led by a man known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, and his militia group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Jolani was a nom-de-guerre, reflecting his family's roots in the Golan Heights, Syria's southern highlands, annexed by Israel after it was occupied in 1967. His real name is Ahmed al-Sharaa.One year later, he is interim president, and Bashar al-Assad is in a gilded exile in Russia. Syria is still in ruins. In every city and village I have visited this last 10 days, people were living in skeletal buildings gutted by war. But for all the new Syria's problems, it feels much lighter without the crushing, cruel weight of the Assads.Getty ImagesSyria is still in ruins. In cities and villages, many people are living in skeletal buildings gutted by warSharaa has found the going easier abroad than at home. He has won the argument with Saudi Arabia and the West that he is Syria's best chance of a stable future.In May, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia arranged a brief meeting between Sharaa and US President Donald Trump. Afterwards, Trump called him a \"young attractive tough guy\".At home, Syrians know his weaknesses and the problems Syria faces better than foreigners. Sharaa's writ does not run in the north-east, where the Kurds are in control, or parts of the south where Syrian Druze, another minority sect, want a separate state backed by their Israeli allies. On the coast Alawites – Assad's sect – fear a repeat of the massacres they suffered in March.AFP via Getty ImagesTrump called him a 'young attractive tough guy'A year ago, the new masters of Damascus, like most of the armed rebels in Syria, were Sunni Islamists. Sharaa, their leader, had a long history fighting for al-Qaeda in Iraq, where he had been imprisoned by the Americans, and then was a senior commander with the group that became Islamic State.Later, as he built his power base in Syria, he broke with and fought both IS and al-Qaeda. People who had travelled to Idlib to see him said that he had developed a much more pragmatic set of beliefs, better suited to governing Syria, with its spectrum of religious sects. Sunnis are the majority. As well as Kurds and Druze, there are Christians, many of whom find it hard to forget Sharaa's jihadist past.Image of a man who outgrew his jihadist rootsIn the first week of December last year, it was hard to believe that the HTS offensive was moving so fast. It took them three days to capture Aleppo, Syria's northern powerhouse.Compare that with the tortured years between 2012 and 2016, when the regime's army and rebel militias had fought for control of the city: that had ended in victory for Assad after Russia's president Vladimir Putin deployed his air force and artillery to add decisive firepower to the regime's ruthless tactics.When I visited the former rebel strongholds in eastern Aleppo a few weeks after they had fallen to the regime, large areas were devastated by Russian bombing. Some streets were blocked by rubble that went up to first-floor balconies.But by the end of 2024, across the country, government troops had melted away. Both reluctant conscripts and regime loyalists were no longer prepared to fight and die for a corrupt and cruel regime that repaid them with poverty and oppression.AFP via Getty ImagesOne year ago - celebrations marking the dawn of a new era for SyriaA few days after Assad fled with his family to Russia, I interviewed Syria's victorious new leader in the presidential palace.It perches high on a crag overlooking Damascus, designed as an ever-visible reminder for the city's citizens of the all-seeing power of the Assads. By then Jolani had discarded his name, along with his combat fatigues.Sharaa sat down in the chilly halls of the unheated palace wearing a smart jacket, pressed trousers and shiny black shoes. He told me that the country was exhausted by war and was not a threat to its neighbours or to the West, insisting that they would govern for all Syrians. It was a message that many Syrians and foreign governments wanted to hear.Israel dismissed it, however. And jihadist hardliners branded Sharaa as a traitor, selling out his religion and his own history.Watch: BBC speaks to Syrian rebel leader Ahmed al-SharaaI had packed in a hurry to report on a war, never expecting the regime to crumble so fast. My formal attire was back at home in London. After the interview one of his aides complained that I should have worn a suit to interview a national leader.His grumble was about more than my sartorial choices. It was the continuation of a long campaign that had started years earlier as Sharaa built up his power in Idlib. The campaign was designed to present him as a man who had outgrown his jihadist roots to become a worthy leader of all Syria, a leader the rest of the world should take seriously and treat with respect.A weakened IS in SyriaSharaa took power amid huge uncertainty about what he might do, and what might be done to him by his enemies. Among them were dark fears that jihadist extremists of the Islamic State, still existing in sleeper cells, could try to kill him, or cause chaos with mass casualty attacks in Damascus.Jihadists rage on social media about Sharaa's charm offensive in the west. After he agreed to join the US-led coalition against Islamic State, prominent voices online branded him an apostate, a Muslim who had turned on his own religion. Extremists could take that as a licence to kill.The reality is that IS in Syria is weak. Its attacks this year have been mostly against Kurdish-led forces in the north-east.That has changed in the last few weeks, leading up to the anniversary of the fall of the Assad regime.Getty ImagesThe war that President Bashar al-Assad seemed to have won was turned upside down one year agoAs security forces have raided IS cells, the jihadists have killed three soldiers and two former Assad operatives in cities controlled by the government, according to data collected by Charles Lister, a leading commentator on Syria, and published in a newsletter Syria Weekly. IS social media channels monitored by the BBC continue to tell Syrian Sunnis that Sharaa has betrayed them.Without producing any proof, they have posted claims that he has been an agent of the US and UK, working to undermine the jihadist project.Winning over Trump and the westSharaa's overtures to the west have been remarkably successful.Within two weeks of taking power in Syria, he received a delegation of senior American diplomats. Immediately, the Americans scrapped the $10 million bounty the they had put on his arrest.Since then, sanctions imposed on Assad's Syria have been steadily reduced. The most swingeing, the Caesar Act, has been suspended and could be repealed by the US Congress in the new year.A major milestone came in November when Sharaa became the first Syrian president to visit the White House.APTrump sprayed Sharaa with cologne, before presenting him with his own supply to take homeTrump's welcome in the Oval Office was relaxed. He sprayed Sharaa with Trump-branded cologne, before presenting him with his own supply to take home for his wife, jokingly asking him how many he has. \"One,\" Sharaa answered, as he blinked away clouds of fragrance.Away from the larking around for the cameras, Saudi Arabia as well as western governments see Sharaa as the best bet – the only one – to stabilise a country that sits at the heart of the Middle East. If Syria slipped back into civil war, there would be zero chance of reducing the violent turbulence in the region.One senior western diplomat told me that the conditions for civil war still exist. That is because of the lasting scars of half a century of dictatorship and 14 years of a war that started as an uprising against the Assads' oppressive rule and turned into an increasingly sectarian fight.AFP via Getty ImagesMany western governments see Sharaa as the best bet to stabilise Syria. His minister for foreign affairs, Assad al-Shaibani is front rightSharaa is a Sunni Muslim, Syria's largest religious group. His government does not control the whole country. In the last year he has not been able to persuade, or force, Kurds in the north-east and Druze in the south to accept the authority of Damascus. On the coast, the Alawite community is nervous and restive.The Alawites are a sect that originated in Shia Islam, with their heartland on Syria's Mediterranean coast. The Assads are Alawites.The founder of the regime, Bashar's father Hafez al-Assad, built his power on the Alawite minority, around 10% of the population. Just the sound of the Alawite accent, especially coming from a man in uniform – or worse, a leather-jacketed operative from one of the regime's intelligence agencies – used to make other Syrians nervous.Syria will not recover if sectarian killing continues. Stopping more serious outbreaks of violence in the next 12 months is the government's most serious challenge.The slow pace of justiceJust before the anniversary of Assad's fall, the UN human rights office (OHCHR) expressed serious concern about the slow pace of justice. A spokesman said, \"While the interim authorities have taken encouraging steps towards addressing past violations, these steps are only the beginning of what needs to be done.\"Some Syrians have taken matters into their own hands, along, at times, with government forces. The OHCHR said that hundreds have been killed over the past year \"by the security forces and affiliated groups, elements associated with the former government, local armed groups and unidentified armed individuals\".They added: \"Other reported violations and abuses include sexual violence, arbitrary detentions, destruction of homes, forced evictions, and restrictions on freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly.\"Alawite, Druze, Christian and Bedouin communities were mainly affected by the violence, the OHCHR said, which has been fed by rising hate speech both on- and offline.Anadolu via Getty ImagesA graduation ceremony for general security personnel last monthA big risk for 2026 is a repeat of last March's sectarian violence in Alawite areas.In the security vacuum that followed the fall of the Assad regime, the new government attempted to stamp its authority on the Syrian coast with a series of arrests. An investigation by OCHCR found that \"pro-former government fighters responded by capturing, killing, and injuring hundreds of interim government forces\".Damascus responded harshly and lost control of militant armed factions that carried a systematic series of deadly attacks on Alawites.The UN found that some 1,400 people, predominantly civilians, were reported killed in the ensuing massacres. The vast majority were adult men, but victims included approximately 100 women, the elderly and the disabled, as well as children.The Sharaa government cooperated with the UN investigation. Some of its forces managed to rescue Alawites and it has put some of the ringleaders of the massacres on trial. ReutersThe UN found that some 1,400 people, predominantly civilians, were reported killed during sectarian violence in Alawite areas in MarchThe UN Syria Commission of Inquiry confirmed it had found no evidence the authorities had ordered the attacks. But the concern then and for the future was that the Damascus government could not control armed Sunni groups that had supposedly joined its security forces.In July in the southern province of Suweida, serious violence between Druze and Bedouin communities shook the Sharaa administration to its roots. The Druze religion developed out of Islam around a thousand years ago, and its followers, who some Muslims believe are heretics, amount to around 3% of Syria's population.When government forces entered Suweida, supposedly to restore order, they ended up fighting Druze militias. Israel, which has its own Druze community that is fiercely loyal to the Jewish state, intervened. Its airstrikes included the near destruction of the ministry of defence in Damascus. It took a rapid American intervention to force a ceasefire that stopped a spiral down into much worse violence. Tens of thousands of people were driven from their homes and remain displaced.Getty ImagesA UN inquiry found no evidence the authorities had ordered the attacks in March. But the concern was that the Damascus government could not control armed Sunni groupsThe Israel questionIt is still not clear whether Sharaa and his interim government are strong enough to survive another crisis as serious as that. Israel remains a looming and dangerous presence to Syrians.After the fall of Assad, the Israelis launched a series of major air strikes to destroy what was left of the old regime's military capacity. The IDF advanced out of the occupied Golan Heights to take control of more Syrian territory, which it still holds.The Israelis were taking advantage of the chaos in Syria to weaken a country it saw as hostile, destroying weapons it said might be turned in its direction.More from InDepthAttempts by the US to broker a security agreement between Israel and Syria have stalled in the last two months or so.Syria wants to return to an agreement originally negotiated by Henry Kissinger when he was US Secretary of State in 1974. Netanyahu wants Israel to stay in the land it seized and has demanded that Syria demilitarises a large area south of Damascus.In the last month Israel has intensified its ground incursions into Syria. Syria Weekly, which collects data on violence, calculates that there were more than twice as many as the monthly average for the rest of the year.We visited the border village of Beit Jinn, which was raided by IDF troops on 28 November. The IDF said they were arresting Sunni militants who were planning attacks. Local men fought back, wounding six Israelis as the raiding party was forced into a hurried retreat, abandoning a military vehicle that they later destroyed with an airstrike. The Israelis killed at least 13 local people and wounded dozens, state media reported.It was a sign of how hard it will be to broker a security deal between Syria and Israel. The Damascus government called it a war crime. Calls for retaliation intensified.Dia Images via Getty ImagesThe border village of Beit Jinn was raided by IDF troops on 28 NovemberIn Washington, Trump was clearly worried by the raid. He posted on his Truth Social platform that he was \"very satisfied\" with Sharaa's efforts at stabilising Syria.He warned that it was \"very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria's evolution into a prosperous state\".In Beit Jinn I met Khalil Abu Daher on his way back from hospital, his arm in plaster after surgery for a bullet wound. He invited me to his home, which is close to where the Israelis were exchanging fire with village men.Khalil told me he was here with his family when the Israelis entered the village at 3:30 am. They tried to find a safe place.\"I was in my house with my children. We went from one room to another. They shot at my two daughters. One was hit, and the other died instantly. When I picked her up, I was shot in the hand.\"The dead girl was 17-year-old Hiba Abu Daher, who was shot in the stomach. They sheltered, Khalil said, alongside Hiba's dead body for two hours before they were rescued and taken to hospital.When I visited, Khalil's nine-year-old daughter was lying on a blanket on the sofa, recovering from surgery to take a bullet out of her hip.Khalil's nine-year-old daughter lying on the sofa, recovering from surgery to take a bullet out of her hipThe girls' mother, Umm Mohammad, sat with the women of the family, desperately worried about the future.\"We want peace of mind,\" she told me. \"We want to live in our homes, and we want a clinic and medical staff because we don't have one.\"We also want a doctor because there isn't one in Beit Jinn, nor is there a pharmacy. We want security.\"'We go to sleep and wake up afraid'A year after the end of Assad's rule, Syria's new rulers have scored some important achievements. They are still in power, which was not guaranteed when they took Damascus. President Trump has become Sharaa's most important backer. Sanctions are being lifted. The economy is showing signs of life and business deals are being done, including modernising oil and gas installations and privatising the airports in Damascus and Aleppo.But deals that are in the pipeline have not yet changed the lives of most Syrians. The government has no rebuilding fund. Reconstruction is up to individuals. Sectarian tensions are unresolved and could ignite again. The US-mediated dialogue with Israel has stalled.NurPhoto via Getty ImagesThe government has no rebuilding fund. Reconstruction is up to individualsBenjamin Netanyahu insists that Damascus might demilitarise a large area of southern Syria and shows no signs of ordering the IDF to pull back. Both points amount to a major violation of Syrian sovereignty. The Beit Jinn raid makes it harder for Damascus to offer concessions.Government in Damascus is centred on Sharaa himself, assisted by the foreign minister Asaad al-Shaibani and a few trusted associates. No serious attempt seems to be happening to create an accountable framework of government.Syria without the Assad family is a better place. But Umm Mohammad summed up the feelings of far too many Syrians.\"The future is difficult. We have nothing, not even schools. Our children are living in hell here. There is no safety for them.

    "body": "8 hours agoDearbail JordanWorkers rescued from Jakarta office building fireA fire at an office building in Jakarta has killed at least 22 people as authorities continue to search for casualties.The blaze at the seven-storey site in the Indonesian capital started on Tuesday afternoon, according to city police chief Susatyo Purnomo Condro, who said some workers were having lunch at the time.Police believe the fire began after a battery exploded on the first floor before the flames spread upwards. A company which makes drones is based in the building.   Susatyo said most of the victims who perished were women, one of whom was pregnant, and it was likely that they had died of asphyxiation from smoke rather than burns. Thick smoke poured from the upper floors as firefighters deployed 28 engines and about 100 personnel, with dramatic footage showing trapped employees being rescued by aerial ladders.The fire has been extinguished and rescue teams are focusing on the upper levels of the building after conducting a sweep of the lower floors.Susatyo said that access to the sixth floor was \"particularly challenging, according to the firefighters on site\", the Jakarta Globe newspaper reports.\"We are still collecting data,\" he told the Associated Press news agency. \"But for now, we are focusing on identifying the victims who have been found.\"The company provides drone services for industrial clients, from aerial surveying and mapping to inspection and agriculture.",

    "body": "22 hours agoKhashayar Joneidi, BBC Persian CorrespondentThe US has deported a second group of Iranian nationals, officials in Tehran said, as the Trump administration continues its immigration enforcement efforts.A chartered plane carrying more than 50 Iranians flew out of Mesa, Arizona, on Sunday, travelling through Cairo and Kuwait before arriving in Iran, according to reports.   Tehran's foreign ministry confirmed the Iranian nationals' return to Iran. US immigration officials could not \"confirm or deny a flight\" for security reasons.The first deportation flight took off from the US in late September, in a rare instance of cooperation between Iran and the US. Many Iranian nationals say they come to the US because they fear persecution at home.Father Joseph Bach, a member of Borderland Companions of Hope, a Franciscan organisation that provides support to migrants, said he has been informed through his contacts inside an Arizona detention facility that Christian converts were among those removed. He also said some detainees had identified as LGBT.Christian converts and members of the LGBT community are groups that face severe legal and social repercussions in Iran.Father Joseph called the deportations \"the most unchristian thing to do\", adding, \"It's scary, it concerns me, it is not OK. I call this a death flight.\"Iranian authorities have facilitated the repatriation efforts. An Iranian consular official said the deported nationals had \"announced their willingness for return following continuation of anti-immigration and discriminative policy against foreign nationals, particularly Iranians, by the United States\", the Iran's judiciary-affiliated Mizan News Agency reports.However, one detainee who spoke with the BBC said not all those who were deported were willing to return.One person who was on a list for potential deportation told the BBC he and his partner crossed into the US on foot from Mexico earlier this year. Speaking from an immigration detention centre in Arizona, he said he feared for his life if he returned to Iran.The latest deportations come as already severely strained relations between the two countries further deteriorated in June, after the US bombed Iran's nuclear facilities.The removals highlight the US government's hardline immigration posture under President Donald Trump, who made border security and reducing unauthorised migration central to his political agenda.",

Abittan was accused of rape in 2021, but investigators later dropped the case, citing lack of evidence.Mrs Macron met Abittan before his performance on Sunday. In a video, he says he feels \"scared\", to which Mrs Macron responds \"if there are any stupid bitches we'll kick them out\", before smiling and laughing.Mrs Macron's team told AFP news agency her words intended to \"critique the radical method\" of the protest.\"Brigitte Macron does not approve of this radical method,\" a member of her team added.The words used by the first lady, \"sales connes\" (which translates to \"stupid bitches\"), have since been adopted by celebrities and feminists online who denounced her actions and violence towards women.The demonstration was organised by Nous Toutes, a French organisation that fights against violence towards women.The majority of those using \"#salesconnes\" on social media are doing so to voice their support for the feminist group.Actor Judith Godrèche - who herself has accused a film director of historical rape, which he denies - added her support.\"I too am a stupid bitch,\" she wrote on social media, with Belgian comedian Florence Mendez also saying she was \"proud\" to be one.Actor and singer Nadège Beausson-Diagne also adopted the term, writing on Instagram: \"I too am a stupid bitch in summer, winter, spring and autumn.\"She went on to voice her support for the \"courageous\" woman who had accused Abittan of rape and for Nous Toutes, adding that the group will \"come back stronger to fight together against sexual violence\".Actor Rachida Brakni also thanked the \"bitches\" and tagged Nous Toutes in her post.Stand-up comedian Marine Leonardi, meanwhile, wrote on Instagram: \"Feminists are never stupid bitches\".Mrs Macron had attended Abittan's show with her daughter.",

    "body": "5 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondentA press conference by María Corina Machado - the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who is currently in-hiding - was cancelled on Tuesday, with the Nobel Institute saying they are \"in the dark\" about her whereabouts.  Machado is Venezuela's opposition leader and has been in hiding since the country's disputed 2024 election, which she and her supporters say was stolen.She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for efforts to bring democracy to Venezuela, and was expected to formally collect it in a ceremony on Wednesday. Although Machado regularly gives social media video updates, usually against a neutral white wall, her current whereabouts are unknown.The Nobel Institute had previously said she would attend the event in person, however on Tuesday it said in a statement: \"María Corina Machado has herself stated in interviews how challenging the journey to Oslo, Norway will be. We therefore cannot at this point provide any further information about when and how she will arrive for the Nobel peace prize ceremony.\"Machado's family are already in Oslo.Venezuela's government has said that if she left Venezuela, Machado would be considered a \"fugitive\" by the authorities. The country's attorney general, Tarek William Saab, told AFP last month: \"By being outside Venezuela and having numerous criminal investigations, she is considered a fugitive\". He added that she is accused of \"acts of conspiracy, incitement of hatred, terrorism\".Machado had earlier told her followers that she would return to Venezuela after collecting the prize.If she attends, it would be her first public appearance since the start of the year, when she went to a protest in Caracas on 9 January against the inauguration of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.After Venezuela's 2024 election, the opposition published tallies suggesting it won, despite Maduro claiming victory. Some nations, including the US, have recognised its candidate - Edmundo González - as the president-elect. Machado was banned from running in the election.",

    "body": "Twelve fired FBI agents are alleging that they were unlawfully sacked because they knelt during a racial justice protest in Washington DC five years ago.In a recently filed lawsuit, the former agents argue that their decision to kneel - adopting a gesture used by demonstrators - helped to deescalate a tense protest situation in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd.The agents believe they were fired on the orders of FBI boss Kash Patel, who is named as a defendant.Their termination letters accused them of \"a lack of impartiality\" in their duties, they say. The FBI has declined to comment on the case.The dozen sacked agents - nine women and three men - say they had been \"confronted by a mob\" when deployed in the US capital city on 4 June 2020, and were responding to a \"dangerous situation\" for which they were ill-prepared. The killing of Floyd, a black man, by a white police officer in Minneapolis had sparked protests across the US and in cities around the world just days earlier.Amid a febrile atmosphere during the protest in the US capital city, the plaintiffs made what was a \"considered tactical decision\" to take a knee, the group said in their legal filing, which gave their account of events. They said they \"avoided triggering violence by assuming a kneeling posture\" which had been used to lessen tensions \"between law enforcement officers and their communities during this period of national unrest\".They say their actions were reviewed at the time by both the FBI and the Department of Justice, of which the FBI is a part. They highlighted that their dismissal letters came more than five years after the incident.The agents are seeking reinstatement in their positions and back pay.In their complaint, the ex-agents said they had been \"targeted\" because their choice of tactics on that day had led to a \"perceived lack of affiliation\" with President Donald Trump, who was in office during the protests.During his tenure leading the FBI, Patel has been accused of a wider crackdown on personnel perceived to be disloyal to his ally Trump. He has previously denied accusations that his sackings at the agency have been politically motivated.Amid recent speculation regarding his future at the top of the agency, the White House said Patel was \"a critical member of the president's team and he is working tirelessly to restore integrity to the FBI.\"The civil case from the 12 former agents, which was filed in the District of Columbia, comes after former FBI acting director Brian Driscoll and others filed a lawsuit of their own, alleging that they too had been terminated in an act of political retribution.",

    "body": "A federal judge in New York has ruled the US Department of Justice can publicly release grand jury materials from Ghislaine Maxwell's sex trafficking investigation.US District Judge Paul Engelmayer said he was ordering the release of material because of a recent law passed by Congress, which requires the justice department to publish files related to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein by the end of next week. In his ruling, he said the court would put in place mechanisms to protect victims from the release of materials that would \"identify them or otherwise invade their privacy\". Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in luring underage girls for Epstein, her former boyfriend, to exploit. Epstein died in prison in 2019.Prosecutors argued Maxwell recruited and groomed girls, some as young as 14, between 1994 and 2004, before they were abused by Epstein.Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence, was moved from a Florida prison to a new minimum-security facility in Texas in August, after she was interviewed by Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche about Epstein. In a letter to Judge Engelmayer, Maxwell's legal team said she did not take a position on the justice department's motion to release the grand jury material.Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, which has released thousands of files and messages it subpoenaed from Epstein's estate, said the unsealing was a \"victory for transparency\". \"These files are now part of the Epstein files held by the Department of Justice, and must be turned over to the Oversight Committee in response to our subpoena,\" he said. The order to publish the records followed a similar ruling from a judge in Florida on Friday, which allowed for the unsealing of documents related to the state's investigation against Epstein that began in 2005.Congress passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in November after previously rejecting calls to release the files. The law \"applies to unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" that relate to Epstein and Maxwell, a court order said.The justice department has until 19 December to publicly release all the information from federal investigations into Epstein, though the law also allows the department to withhold files that involve active criminal investigations or raise privacy concerns.Florida and New York judges had previously refused to unseal grand jury materials related to Epstein, citing federal rules that require grand jury processes to be kept secret.But after Congress passed the bill to release the Epstein material, the justice department made the same request, arguing the legislation's \"clear mandate\" should \"override\" those secrecy rules.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has criticised European leaders as \"weak\" and suggested the US could scale back support for Ukraine.In a wide-ranging interview with Politico, he said \"decaying\" European countries had failed to control migration or take decisive action to end Ukraine's war with Russia, accusing them of letting Kyiv fight \"until they drop\". European leaders have made attempts to carve out a role in the US-led efforts to end the war, which they fear will undercut the long-term interests of the continent in favour of a quick resolution.In response, the UK's Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said all she saw in Europe was \"strength\", citing investment in defence as well as funding for Kyiv.She added two presidents were \"working for peace\" - referring to Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - and \"one president - President Putin - has so far simply sought to escalate the conflict with further drone and missile attacks\".Trump continued to increase pressure on Zelensky to agree to a peace deal, and urged him to \"play ball\" by ceding territory to Moscow. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Zelensky, writing on X later on Tuesday, said Ukraine and Europe were working actively on \"all components of potential steps toward ending the war\", that the Ukrainian and European elements of the plan were now more developed.He then told reporters he believed the plans would be submitted to the US on Wednesday. Trump's latest public criticism of Europe comes a day after European leaders came together in London to discuss their continued joint efforts to stop the fighting in Ukraine.Asked whether Europe could help end the war, Trump said: \"They talk but they don't produce. And the war just keeps going on and on.\"US officials have held separate talks with Ukrainian and Russian officials in recent weeks in an attempt to broker an end to the war. So far, no agreement has been reached.Ukraine's president has pressed European and Nato leaders to help deter the US from backing a deal that Kyiv fears would leave it exposed to future attacks.On Sunday Trump suggested, without evidence, that Zelensky was the main obstacle to peace. He told reporters that Russia was \"fine\" with the peace plan outlined to both sides by the US, that contained major concessions for Ukraine and which allies feared would leave it vulnerable to a future invasion.In the Politico interview, he claimed Ukrainian negotiators \"loved\" the US-backed proposal and alleged Zelensky had not yet read it.Trump also repeated previous calls for Kyiv to hold elections and claimed it was \"using war\" as a reason not to do so. He said: \"You know, they talk about a democracy, but it gets to a point where it's not a democracy anymore.\"Zelensky's five-year term as president was due to end in May 2024, but elections have been suspended in Ukraine since martial law was declared after Russia's invasion.Speaking to reporters after Trump's comments, Zelensky said he was \"ready for the elections\" and he would ask for proposals to be drawn up which could change the law.Elections could be held in the next 60 to 90 days if security is guaranteed with the help of the US and other allies, he told reporters.Also in the Politico interview, Trump claimed ideological divisions now threatened to fracture Washington's alliances with Europe.Asked whether leaders who he viewed as weak could still be allies, he replied: \"It depends\", adding: \"I think they're weak, but I also think that they want to be so politically correct. I think they don't know what to do.\"The president's remarks came after his administration released its new 33-page National Security Strategy, which warned of Europe's potential \"civilisational erasure\" and questioned whether some nations could remain reliable allies. Russia welcomed that strategy - which did not cast Russia as a threat to the US - as \"largely consistent\" with Moscow's vision.Trump also warned on Tuesday many countries in Europe \"will not be viable countries any longer\" if they keep on the way they are going, adding: \"What they're doing with immigration is a disaster.\"He singled out Hungary and Poland as doing a \"very good job\" on immigration, but said most European nations were \"decaying\".Responding on Tuesday to the strategy, German chancellor Friedrich Merz said some parts were plausible and some understandable, but other elements were unacceptable from a European point of view. He rejected the idea that the US needed to \"save democracy\" in Europe, saying Europeans could address such questions themselves.The strategy also followed similar rhetoric to Trump's speech to the UN earlier this year, where he had harsh criticism for western Europe and its approach to migration and clean energy.",

    "body": "Does Japan's megaquake warning mean the 'big one' is coming?13 hours agoShaimaa Khalil,BBC News, TokyoandFlora Drury,BBC News, LondonAFP via Getty ImagesAfter a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck north-eastern Japan on Monday, authorities again warned of the possibility of a future megaquake.It means that thoughts in Japan are turning to the \"big one\" - a once-in-a-century quake.In September, Japan's earthquake investigation panel said there was a 60-90% chance that a megaquake would occur in the Nankai Trough  - an area of seismic activity which stretches along Japan's Pacific coast - within the next 30 years. In April authorities had warned that a megaquake had the potential to trigger a tsunami of more than 20m (66ft) which could hit parts of Tokyo and other prefectures. They predicted that there would be around 300,000 deaths and trillions of dollars in economic damage.So, what is the \"big one\", can it be predicted - and is it likely to strike any time soon?What did the latest warning say?Officials urged residents in seven prefectures from Hokkaido in the north to Chiba in central Japan to stay on high alert for a potential megaquake.This is a vast area with millions of people.A government official said there was a possibility that \"a large-scale earthquake with a magnitude of 8 or higher could occur as a follow-up earthquake\" in the region.Authorities also told people to check evacuation routes, secure furniture, and prepare emergency kits, including food, water and portable toilets.However, an evacuation order was not issued. Japan's director for disaster management said at a news conference that global earthquake data suggests there's a possibility, not a prediction, of a larger tremor to come.Officials said the possibility of a larger quake occurring is about one in 100. What is a megaquake?APThe last megaquake occured along the Nankai Trough almost 80 years agoJapan is a country used to earthquakes. It sits on the Ring of Fire and, as a result, experiences about 1,500 earthquakes a year. The vast majority do little damage, but there are some - like the one which struck in 2011 measuring magnitude 9.0, sending a tsunami into the north-east coast and killing more than 18,000 people.But the one that authorities fear may strike in this more densely populated region to the south could - in the absolute worst-case scenario - be even more deadly.Earthquakes along the Nankai Trough have already been responsible for thousands of deaths. In 1707, a rupture along its entire 600km length caused the second-biggest earthquake ever recorded in Japan and was followed by the eruption of Mount Fuji.The Nankai Trough sits between Suruga Bay, in central Japan, and the Hyuganada Sea in Kyushu to the southThese so-called \"megathrust\" earthquakes tend to strike every hundred years or so, often in pairs: the last ones were in 1944 and 1946.And this long-anticipated event is, according to geologists Kyle Bradley and Judith A Hubbard, \"the original definition of the 'Big One'”.\"The history of great earthquakes at Nankai is convincingly scary\" so as to be concerning, the pair acknowledged in their Earthquake Insights newsletter last year.But can earthquakes actually be predicted?Not according to Robert Geller, professor emeritus of seismology at the University of Tokyo.When authorities issued a megaquake warning last year, after a 7.1 quake struck southern Japan, Prof Geller told the BBC that the warning had \"almost nothing to do with science\".The advisory was \"not a useful piece of information\", he said.This, he argued, is because while earthquakes are known to be a \"clustered phenomenon\", it is \"not possible to tell in advance whether a quake is a foreshock or an aftershock”.Indeed, only about 5% of earthquakes are \"foreshocks\", said Bradley and Hubbard.However, the 2011 earthquake was preceded by a 7.2 magnitude foreshock, they note - one which was largely ignored.The warning system was drawn up after 2011 in an attempt to prevent a disaster of this scale again. August 2024 was the first time the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) used it.Getty ImagesA massive earthquake in 2011 killed more than 18,000 peopleBut, crucially, while it told people to be prepared, it did not tell anyone to evacuate. Indeed, they were keen to play down any massive imminent risk.\"The likelihood of a new major earthquake is higher than normal, but this is not an indication that a major earthquake will definitely occur,\" the JMA said at the time.Additional reporting by Chika Nakayama and Jake Lapham",

    "body": "21 hours agoKayla EpsteinGetty ImagesNew York City Mayor-Elect Zohran MamdaniNew York City Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani will live in the Manhattan mansion that his predecessors have called home, leaving behind a rent-stabilised apartment that became the subject of heated debate during his campaign.Gracie Mansion, which dates to 1799, has served as the residence for most New York City mayors since World War Two. But Mamdani, for whom affordable housing is a central issue, did not confirm he would live there immediately following his victory in November.\"This decision came down to our family's safety and the importance of dedicating all of my focus on enacting the affordability agenda New Yorkers voted for,\" Mamdani said in a statement on Monday.He has been living in the Astoria neighbourhood in the borough of Queens. The area, home to many middle-class families, is famous for its abundance of immigrant communities and global cuisine.\"To Astoria: thank you for showing us the best of New York City,\" Mamdani's statement said.\"While I may no  longer live in Astoria, Astoria will always live inside me and the work I do.\"During his campaign, Mamdani tied his core platform - freeze the rent – to his own housing situation. But his rivals, mainly former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, criticised Mamdani for occupying the apartment even though he came from a famous family. His mother is the filmmaker Mira Nair, and his father, Mahmood Mamdani, is a professor at Columbia University.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesGracie Mansion, built in 1799, is the official residence of the New York City mayorNot every mayor has chosen to live at Gracie Mansion.Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire entrepreneur and founder of the eponymous financial and media company, chose to live in his own townhouse on the Upper East Side neighbourhood of Manhattan during his three terms, which ended in 2012.Bloomberg said he believed Gracie Mansion should be a space for public city functions, and he pushed for an extensive renovation of the ageing property.When Mamdani moves in, sometime around his inauguration on 1 January, he will find himself in surroundings very different than his modest Astoria digs.With its butter yellow paint, green shutters, and white railings, Gracie Mansion is a wedding cake of a house overlooking the East River. Inside, the lower floor of the Federal-style mansion is decorated in the spirit of the home's original era.The compound, which reportedly has five bedrooms, also has enhanced security to protect the mayor and their family.Some residents have alleged that Gracie Mansion also has supernatural lodgers. Chirlane McCray, the wife of former mayor Bill De Blasio, told reporters that doors occasionally opened and closed by themselves, and the floorboards creaked eerily.Outgoing Mayor Eric Adams was more certain. \"I don't care what anyone says,\" he declared in 2022. \"There are ghosts in there, man.\"Mamdani's current apartment is rent stabilised, meaning the city sets limits on how much landlords can raise the rent each year. New Yorkers consider these apartments valuable lifelines as the cost of housing outpaces what many can afford.Records showed Mamdani paid about $2,300 (£1,725) each month for his apartment. According to the real estate platform Zillow, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in New York City is $3,500 (£2,625) a month.",

    "body": "2 days agoLaura CressTechnology reporterGetty ImagesX has blocked the European Commission from making adverts on its platform - a move which comes a few days after it fined Elon Musk's site €120m (£105m) over its blue tick badges.Nikita Bier, who has a senior role at the social media site, accused the European Union (EU) regulator of trying to \"take advantage\" of \"an exploit\" in its advertising system to promote its post about the fine on Friday.\"It seems you believe that the rules should not apply to your account,\" he said. \"Your ad account has been terminated.\"A European Commission spokesperson told BBC News the Commission \"always uses all social media platforms in good faith\".X's fine, issued on Friday, was the first under the EU's Digital Services Act.The EU regulator said the platform's blue tick system was \"deceptive\" because the firm was not \"meaningfully verifying users\".\"This deception exposes users to scams, including impersonation frauds, as well as other forms of manipulation by malicious actors,\" it said.It claimed X was also failing to provide transparency around its adverts, and was not giving researchers access to public data.The social media platform has been given 60 days to respond to the Commission about concerns surrounding its blue checkmarks, or face extra penalties.Following the fine, Elon Musk posted on his platform to say the EU \"should be abolished\", and retweeted a response from another X user comparing it to fascism.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accused the EU regulator of attacking and censoring US firms, adding, \"the days of censoring Americans online are over\".'Never been abused like this'The dispute originated with Mr Bier, who accused the Commission of activating a rarely-used account \"to take advantage of an exploit\".He claimed it had posted a link which itself deceived users - tricking them into thinking it was a video \"to artificially increase its reach\".He said the \"exploit\", which had \"never been abused like this\", had now been removed.Ad accounts on X are used by businesses to create and analyse paid advertising campaigns and run \"promoted\" posts on the site, separate from the users' X profile. In response, a European Commission spokesperson told BBC News that it was \"simply using the tools that platforms themselves are making available to our corporate accounts\".\"⁠We expect these tools to be fully in line with the platforms' own terms and conditions, as well as with our legislative framework,\" it said.And it is not the first time there has been disagreement between X and global regulators.In 2024, Brazil's Supreme Court lifted a ban on X after it agreed to pay 28 million reais ($5.1m; £3.8m), and blocked accounts accused of spreading misinformation. The previous year, Australia's internet safety watchdog fined it A$610,000 ($386,000; £317,360) for failing to cooperate with a probe into anti-child abuse practices.",

    "body": "9 hours agoAlfred LasteckBBC Africa, ArushaSecurity was tightened across Tanzania on Tuesday with police and military seen patrolling major cities ahead of anticipated anti-government protests called to coincide with independence day.By sunset, however, no major demonstrations had taken place.Residents in Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Mbeya, Mwanza and several other urban centres reported an unusually slow start to the day, with many people choosing to remain indoors amid uncertainty over whether protests would happen.The demonstrations were called to demand political reforms in the wake of October's post-election unrest which left an unknown number of people dead.The authorities have admitted using force against protesters, claiming that some groups were attempting to overthrow the regime.On Tuesday, BBC reporters observed nearly empty streets in the commercial capital, Dar es Salaam. This was a stark contrast to the city's usual weekday bustle. Although quiet, the atmosphere remained tense. In a statement, police spokesperson David Misime assured the public of their safety and the protection of their property, saying the situation remained calm nationwide. He also urged citizens to dismiss old photos and video clips circulating on social media that falsely suggest protests are taking place.Security vehicles were seen driving along major roads and intersections, while officers took up positions at strategic locations, including around key public infrastructure.Public transport stopped operating entirely, the AFP news agency reported.On social media, activists and campaigners urged supporters to stay alert, suggesting any demonstrations were unlikely to begin until the afternoon. The messaging echoed previous protest calls in Tanzania, when turnout increased later in the day.\"We will move out, it is our right to protest... I know police are everywhere in the town and even in the street where I live... we have plans so wait, you will see what will happen,\" a resident of Arusha told the BBC earlier on Tuesday.\"I am scared for my children, if these protests happen, it will create a bad atmosphere. Like now my husband is hospitalised, how am I going to attend to him? I feel protesters should call off plans to move to the streets, we need to live in peace,\" said a resident of Mwanza in northern Tanzania.Motorists who ventured out reported frequent checks at roadblocks, where officers questioned drivers about their destinations.The government has not issued detailed comments on the heightened security measures or on the planned protests.Tanzanian authorities have banned the planned protests and cancelled independence day celebrations, urging citizens to stay indoors.Meanwhile, in neighbouring Kenya several activists were arrested on Tuesday as they were holding a solidarity protest outside the Tanzanian high commission in the capital, Nairobi.",

    "body": "52 minutes agoGeeta Pandey,BBC CorrespondentandVishnukant Tiwari,BBC HindiRishabh Rajput and Sonali ChoukseyRishabh Rajput and Sonali Chouksey were married last monthRishabh Rajput and Sonali Chouksey met in college 11 years ago, fell in love and married last month.Photos and videos from their colourful wedding showed the happy couple from the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh performing rituals and posing in their finery.But when they shared their happiest moment on social media, the congratulatory messages came peppered with \"jokes and memes\" with trolls comparing and criticising the couple over the groom's skin colour.In India, where obsession with fair skin colour is well documented and can sometimes even have tragic consequences, the groom faced intense online shaming and was called names for his \"darker skin colour\". The trolls did not spare the bride either, with many suggesting she had married him \"for his money\". \"She must have had some compulsion,\" one wrote. Another suggested she couldn't be happy with a husband like that. Some labelled her a \"gold-digger,\" claiming she married him for wealth or a secure government job with perks. One comment suggested that Mr Rajput's father must be \"a government minister\".The couple, who married on 23 November, have since gone viral because of the trolling - and their response, as they addressed the criticism head-on. They have been sought out by local media and given scores of interviews in the past two weeks.\"People were making jokes and memes and it felt very wrong,\" Mr Rajput told BBC Hindi from his home in Jabalpur.\"It was our moment and we had waited for it so many years. It was supposed to be a happy moment, but when I saw people's reactions, I was really shocked,\" he said.\"In so many years that we have been together, no-one had ever told us that we were a mismatch because I have dark complexion while she is fairer,\" he added.BBC HindiSonali Chouksey and Rishabh Rajput met in college in 2014 and fell in loveThe nasty comments left the couple - who both work in private companies - reeling.Ms Chouksey admitted that such comments \"bothered\" her. \"You think - is this is how people are perceiving us? When they say nasty things about him or call me a gold-digger, it irritates me.\"In a post on Instagram, Mr Rajput addressed the trolls: \"Sorry to disappoint you. I'm not a government employee, but I work hard for my family and want to give them a good, dignified life.\"He added that Sonali fell in love with him when he had nothing. \"From college till today, she has stood with me through every good and bad moment. People's negative opinions mean nothing to me,\" he wrote.Mr Rajput also addressed the issue of colourism in the comments, saying he had faced colour discrimination his whole life.\"I know very well that I have a dark complexion. But in my wife's eyes, I am trying to be the best husband I can be, and that is what matters the most. There is no need to speak wrongly about my family.\"Mr Rajput said he pushed back when the trolls began commenting on one of the photos that also had his mother and his and his wife's sisters.\"I did not like the fact that they targeted my family. I want to tell them, you are a nobody. And you have no right to target - or troll - anyone's family,\" he said.The couple, together since meeting in a 2014 college zoology class, say outsiders shouldn't judge their lives.\"Our relationship began a year later and we knew from then that one day we would be married. Those who are commenting on our relationship by looking at a 30-second video don't know that it captures 11 years of hard work that we have put into it,\" says Mr Rajput.\"Sonali had always manifested that when we get married, our entire village should witness it. But today, it seems like the whole world is watching it,\" he says.That attention, the couple agree, feels good in a way. But the comments, Ms Chouksey adds, are hurting their families. \"For people, it may be just something they watch on social media, but it's our life. And it can destroy someone's family.\"The couple have also addressed colourism in several of their interviews.\"We live in India where people from different regions have different skin colour. And fair skin doesn't necessarily make someone a good person. So, how can we judge someone on the basis of their skin colour?\" asks Ms Chouksey.Mr Rajput says \"about 70-80% people in India have darker skin tones, but the Indian mentality is that fairer is better. It's time to change that notion\".And for those who say the couple are a mismatch, he has a question: \"When you look at us, do we look even remotely unhappy to you? We don't. Because we have what most people don't have. I have her and she has me.\"",

    "body": "2 days agoSuranjana TewariAsia Business Correspondent, TokyoBBCScientists at Waseda University in Tokyo are developing caregiving robotsLast year, more than 18,000 older people living with dementia left their homes and went missing in Japan. Almost 500 were later found dead.Police say such cases have doubled since 2012. Elderly people aged 65 and over now make up nearly 30% of Japan's population - the second-highest proportion in the world after Monaco, according to the World Bank. The crisis is further compounded by a shrinking workforce and tight limits on foreign workers coming in to provide care.Japan's government has identified dementia as one of its most urgent policy challenges, with the Health Ministry estimating that dementia-related health and social care costs will reach 14 trillion yen ($90bn; £67bn) by 2030 - up from nine trillion yen in 2025. In its most recent strategy, the government has signalled a stronger pivot toward technology to ease the pressure.Across the country, people are adopting GPS-based systems to keep track of those who go missing.Some regions offer wearable GPS tags that can alert authorities the moment a person leaves a designated area.In some towns, convenience-store workers receive real-time notifications – a kind of community safety net that can locate a missing person within hours.Robot caregivers and AIOther technologies aim to detect dementia earlier.Fujitsu and Acer Medical's aiGait uses AI to analyse posture and walking patterns, picking up early signs of dementia – shuffling while walking, slower turns or difficulty standing – generating skeletal outlines clinicians can review during routine check-ups.\"Early detection of age-related diseases is key,\" says Hidenori Fujiwara, a Fujitsu spokesperson. \"If doctors can use motion-capture data, they can intervene earlier and help people remain active for longer.\"Meanwhile, researchers at Waseda University are developing AIREC, a 150kg humanoid robot designed to be a \"future\" caregiver. It can help a person put on socks, scramble eggs and fold laundry. The scientists at Waseda University hope that in the future, AIREC will be able to change adult nappies and prevent bedsores in patients.Toshio Morita (R) works at the Restaurant of Mistaken OrdersSimilar robots are already being used in care homes to play music to residents or guide them in simple stretching exercises.They are also monitoring patients at night - placed under mattresses to track sleep and conditions - and cutting back on the need for humans doing the rounds.Although humanoid robots are being developed for the near future, Assistant Professor Tamon Miyake says the level of precision and intelligence required will take at last five years before they are safely able to interact with humans.\"It requires full-body sensing and adaptive understanding - how to adjust for each person and situation,\" he says.Emotional support is also part of the innovation drive.Poketomo, a 12cm tall robot, can be carried around in a bag or can fit into a pocket. It reminds users to take medication, tells you how to prepare in real time for the weather outside and offers conversation for those living alone, which its creators say helps to ease social isolation.\"We're focusing on social issues... and to use new technology to help solve those problems,\" Miho Kagei, development manager from Sharp told the BBC.While devices and robots offer new ways to assist, human connection remains irreplaceable.\"Robots should supplement, not substitute, human caregivers,\" Mr Miyake, the Waseda University scientist said. \"While they may take over some tasks, their main role is to assist both caregivers and patients.\"At the Restaurant of Mistaken Orders in Sengawa, Tokyo, founded by Akiko Kanna, people stream in to be served by patients suffering from dementia.Inspired by her father's experience with the condition, Ms Kanna wanted a place where people could remain engaged and feel purposeful.Toshio Morita, one of the café's servers, uses flowers to remember which table ordered what.Despite his cognitive decline, Mr Morita enjoys the interaction. For his wife, the café provides respite and helps keep him engaged.Kanna's café illustrates why social interventions and community support remain essential. Technology can provide tools and relief, but meaningful engagement and human connection are what truly sustain people living with dementia.\"Honestly? I wanted a little pocket money. I like meeting all sorts of people,\" Mr Morita says. \"Everyone's different - that's what makes it fun.\"Getty ImagesSharp's Poketomo robot has been designed to give companionship to patientsAdditional reporting by Jaltson Akkanath Chummar",

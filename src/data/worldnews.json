    "body": "<div><p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has announced he is ending his bid for re-election, just five weeks before voters go to the polls.</p><p>Adams said \"constant media speculation\" about his future and the city campaign finance board's decision to deny him public matching funds throttled his campaign.</p><p>His withdrawal narrows the race down to Democrat Zohran Mamdani, former governor Andrew Cuomo, and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa.</p><p>Adams, elected in 2022 as a Democrat, was running as an independent after he was indicted for alleged bribery and fraud. The indictment was later dismissed at the direction of the Trump administration. </p></div><div><p>\"I cannot continue my re-election campaign,\" Adams said in a video posted on social media on Sunday. </p><p>\"The constant media speculation about my future and the campaign finance board's decision to withhold millions of dollars have undermined my ability to raise the funds needed for a serious campaign.\" </p><p>Adams has not endorsed any of his rivals in the race. But he did make comments in his withdrawal statement that appeared to be directed at Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee and front-runner in the race.</p><p>\"Major change is welcome and necessary, but beware of those who claim the answer to destroy the very system we built together over generations,\" he said without naming Mamdani, a self-described socialist. \"That is not change, that is chaos.\"</p><p>Adams warned that \"insidious forces\" were pushing \"divisive agendas\" in city politics. </p><p>Mamdani himself spoke to MSNBC later on Sunday, saying the city's inhabitants were \"tired\" by Adams' brand of politics, and standing by his \"vision for a city that New Yorkers can actually afford\".</p><p>A former police officer who was once seen as a rising star in New York politics, Adams's popularity waned due to corruption allegations, tensions with Democrats over immigration, and frustration with the city's rising cost of living.</p><p>In an indictment last September, Adams was alleged to have accepted gifts totalling more than $100,000 (£75,000) from Turkish citizens in exchange for favours. He denied any wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty. </p><p>In April, the justice department ordered federal prosecutors in New York to drop the charges. But the controversy continued to haunt Adams as he trailed in the re-election race.</p><p>His relationship with the Democrats deteriorated during the Biden administration as he criticised its immigration strategy. </p><p>Earlier this year, he said he would run as an independent - a move that spared him from the competitive Democratic primary, which was won by Mamdani.</p><p>Adams will serve out the remainder of his term, which ends on 1 January. His name will remain on the ballot because the deadline to change it has passed.</p></div>"

The most notorious was a compound known as Crouching Tiger Villa, where workers were routinely beaten and tortured. </p><p>Then, two years ago, an alliance of insurgent groups launched an offensive which drove the Myanmar military out of large areas of Shan State, and took control of Laukkai. China, which holds significant influence over these groups, was assumed to have given the offensive a green light. </p><p>Ming Xuechang, the family patriarch, reportedly killed himself; other family members were handed over to the Chinese authorities. Some have made remorseful confessions.</p><p>Thousands of those working in the scam centres have also been handed over to the Chinese police. </p><p>With these sentences China is signalling its determination to deal harshly with the scam business on its border. Pressure from Beijing also forced Thailand to take action against scam centres along its border with Myanmar earlier this year. </p><p>Despite this the business has adapted, with much of it now operating in Cambodia, though it is still prevalent in Myanmar.</p></div>"

They also found the suspect's makeshift explosive devices, said James Deir, an agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p><p>Less than 10 minutes after the shooting, the gunman died in a shootout with police, officials said. </p><p>Investigators said on Monday that they had interviewed over 100 victims and witnesses as a part of the investigation and spent the whole night processing the scene of the crime. </p></div><p></p><h2>What do we know about the suspect? </h2><p></p><div><p>Though officials have not given a motive, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that Sanford was \"an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith\".</p><p>Officials have said the suspect was a former Marine who was once deployed to Iraq. </p><p>Sanford told local outlet Clarkston News that he was a sergeant in the Marines and was deployed to Fallujah in Iraq in 2007. </p><p>\"I'm excited to go,\" he told the newspaper. \"There are many changes we are making in the Middle East, we are making progress.\"</p><p>Sanford had previous arrests for a burglary and operating a vehicle while intoxicated, officials said on Monday. </p><p>Not much information is available about the suspect's political beliefs, but his Facebook profile features a photo of him in 2019 wearing what appears to be a shirt promoting the re-election of Donald Trump in 2020. </p><p>A Google Street View image of a property linked to Sanford also appears to show a pro-Trump sign outside of the house. </p><p>Sanford also appeared to be a father of a son who had serious health issues, according to posts from his family and a fundraising page. </p><p>Sanford is from a suburb of Flint of about 30,000 people, just a few miles away from Grand Blanc Township. </p></div></article>"

Its football titles, now known as EA FC, have sold 325 million copies since the first release in 1993.</p><p>The Sims has sold more than 200 million copies, and Need For Speed more than 150 million.</p><p>But it has also been the publisher of many other popular titles - often being the partner of choice for games in the Harry Potter and James Bond series in the past.</p><p>The purchase will be a big gaming feather in the cap of Saudi Arabia, which has been increasing its presence in the industry in recent years.</p><p>In March 2025, the nation's investment fund paid $3.5bn to purchase the gaming division of Niantic - giving it control of the hit mobile game Pokémon Go.</p><p>The purchase became part of Scopely Inc - makers of Monopoly Go - which itself was bought by PIF subsidiary Savvy Games Group for $4.9bn in 2023.</p><p>Saudi Arabia has made waves in the eSports industry, hosting major tournaments including the eSports World Cup, and it will also host 2027's planned Olympic esports Games.</p><p>The country already has stakes in other big gaming firms such as Nintendo and Take-Two Interactive, but the EA purchase marks a significant extension of its reach.</p><p>Its PIF has hundreds of billions in assets due to its oil wealth, and it is controlled by the country's prince Mohammed bin Salman, whose government has been accused of human rights violations.</p><p>A 2019 UN report stated \"the state of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is responsible\" for the death of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist who was critical of the country's government.</p><p>Saudi Arabia has always denied this.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp\" alt=\"A green promotional banner with black squares and rectangles forming pixels, moving in from the right.

It is also home to critically endangered black rhinos.</p><p>The country's environment ministry believes the fire broke out on Monday at a charcoal production site outside the park's borders.</p><p>Almost a week on, it has spread into the park killing at least nine antelope and destroying wildlife habitats, as well as hundreds of thousands of hectares of grazing pasture outside the park in regions bordering Angola.</p></div><div><p>\"Strong winds and dry vegetation\" were partly to blame for the rapid escalation of the blaze, officials say. </p><p>Opposition MP Likando Rodrick recently criticised the government for failing to contain the fire, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.namibian.com.na/etosha-fire-blamed-on-environment-ministry-being-unprepared/\">saying it should have been better prepared and urging it to beef up</a> its long-term response measures.</p><p>At an emergency meeting on Saturday, it was decided to send more than 500 troops to help firefighters, police, and volunteers on the ground, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/ngurare/status/1971999285521817643\">Prime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare said on X</a>.</p><p>Late on Sunday, the presidency said fires which had spread to grazing land in Oshikoto, Oshana and Kunene regions were now under control. But, it said, the full extent of destruction would not be clear until aerial photographs were complete.</p><p>\"The fire poses a significant threat to the biodiversity, wildlife and livelihood of the communities in the affected areas,\" the statement added, but \"thankfully, no human casualties have been reported\".</p><p>Covering a total of 22,935 sq km (8,855 sq miles), Etosha National Park is one of the largest in Africa. Some 200,000 tourists visit the nature reserve every year, according to the government.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://embassyofnamibia.fr/perch/resources/pdf/etosha-national-park-fact-sheet-etosha.pdf\">It boasts a total of 114 mammal species</a> and attract hundreds of migratory birds including flamingos.</p><p>Experts say wildfires occur naturally in arid savannah <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/Etosha\">and believe occasional wildfires are a necessary part of keeping ecosystems healthy</a> - provided they are managed closely.</p><p>The fire poses a significant threat to the biodiversity, wildlife and livelihood of the communities in the affected areas. Approximately 30% of the grazing in the Park has been destroyed by the fire. Arial imagery will be undertaken to determine the extent of the spread of the fire and the area destroyed.</p></div>"

Stocks for companies such as Netflix and Disney dipped briefly, then bounced back. </p></div><div><p>Several recent major films produced by US studios were shot outside of America, including Deadpool & Wolverine, Wicked and Gladiator II.</p><p>The US remains a major film production hub globally despite challenges, according to movie industry research firm ProdPro.</p><p>Its annual report showed the country saw $14.54bn (£10.94bn) of production spending last year.

By the verdict's delivery, four of the five convicted men had died. Ordering the sole surviving convict to surrender, the court admitted it regretted not ruling sooner.</p><p>The backlog has even prompted legal action. Earlier this year, a group of Allahabad High Court lawyers petitioned for more judicial appointments, calling the court \"paralysed\" by a shortage of judges that leaves cases lingering for years.</p><p>The crisis has caught the attention of India's top court. In January, the Supreme Court called it \"worrisome\" that case listings at the Allahabad High Court are unpredictable, saying the system had completely collapsed.</p><p>Uncertain hearing dates hit people hard, especially in vast Uttar Pradesh. Many travel hundreds of kilometres to Prayagraj where the court is located on just a few days' notice for their hearing.</p><p>Mr Rajput is from Kanpur, 200km (125 miles) from Prayagraj. He spends around four hours travelling each time his case is listed - yet can never be sure it will actually be heard.</p><p>\"I'm over 70,\" he says. \"I often learn just days in advance that my case is listed, making travel a hassle.\" He adds that many times his case isn't heard because other matters take up the whole day. </p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9275/live/15634d90-9a86-11f0-a64c-235ee04911fb.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9275/live/15634d90-9a86-11f0-a64c-235ee04911fb.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9275/live/15634d90-9a86-11f0-a64c-235ee04911fb.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9275/live/15634d90-9a86-11f0-a64c-235ee04911fb.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9275/live/15634d90-9a86-11f0-a64c-235ee04911fb.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9275/live/15634d90-9a86-11f0-a64c-235ee04911fb.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9275/live/15634d90-9a86-11f0-a64c-235ee04911fb.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9275/live/15634d90-9a86-11f0-a64c-235ee04911fb.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Umang Poddar/BBC A man binds case files outside the Allahabad high court \" /><span>Umang Poddar/BBC</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>A man preparing court files outside the Allahabad High Court</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Lawyers have long urged the court to set up another bench - a branch of the high court in a different city to ease access and speed up hearings - in the western part of the state. Currently, an additional bench exists in the city of Lucknow. A similar recommendation was made in 1985 by a government commission, but it has yet to be implemented.</p><p>Earlier this year, the state government reportedly <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/lawyers-attempt-to-establish-wup-hc-bench-fails-again-causing-gloom/articleshow/107196913.cms\">urged the high court</a> to set up another bench, but the letter was later withdrawn for unknown reasons. The push for more benches isn't limited to Uttar Pradesh; a 2009 Law Commission report said all states would benefit from additional high court branches.</p><p>While new benches could help long-term, experts say quicker fixes - like appointing more judges - are needed. </p><p>But the process is slow and complex: senior high court judges first shortlist candidates, then the list is reviewed by the state and federal governments, and the Chief Justice of India. After this, senior Supreme Court judges forward the final list to the federal government for appointment.</p><p>Experts say picking the right candidates is often challenging. Former Allahabad High Court Chief Justice Govind Mathur notes that chief justices, often appointed from outside the state, may not know local lawyers or judges, complicating recommendations. Names can be rejected at any stage and remain confidential until the Supreme Court forwards them to the government.</p><p>Last year, the Supreme Court <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cdnbbsr.s3waas.gov.in/s3ec0490f1f4972d133619a60c30f3559e/uploads/2025/05/2025051927.pdf\">recommended just one appointment </a>for the Allahabad High Court, despite nearly half the seats being vacant. Some progress came this year, after 40 new judges were added - 24 of whom were appointed last week - but the backlog persists.</p><p>Experts say the backlog is so huge that even at full strength, each judge would handle over 7,000 pending cases. </p><p>Mr Mathur says that deeper judicial reforms - like a \"uniform policy for hearing and disposing of cases\" - are essential, rather than leaving it to individual judges.</p></div></article>"

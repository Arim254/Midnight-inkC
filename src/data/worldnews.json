    "body": "22 minutes agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseA US naval strike force centred around the world's largest warship, the USS Gerald R Ford, has arrived in the Caribbean, the US Navy has confirmed. The arrival of the strike group, which was ordered to the region by President Donald Trump last month, comes amid ongoing strikes against alleged drug boats and tensions with Venezuela. The US has so far carried out at least 19 strikes against boats in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, killing at least 76 people. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and other Venezuelan officials have accused the US of \"fabricating\" a crisis and seeking to topple the country's left-wing socialist government. The aircraft carrier movement also comes amid tensions between the Trump administration and the Colombian government of President Gustavo Petro, whom Trump has characterised as \"a thug and a bad guy\".Petro on Tuesday ordered his country's public security forces to suspend intelligence sharing with US agencies until the boat attacks in the Caribbean stop.He wrote on X that the fight against drugs \"must be subordinated to the human rights of the Caribbean people\".In a statement, the US Navy said that the strike group entered the area of responsibility of US Southern Command - which oversees Latin America and the Caribbean - on 11 November. The force includes the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, which itself includes more than 4,000 sailors and dozens of aircraft. The strike force also includes guided-missile destroyers and various other vessels. Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said that the force will \"bolster US capacity to detect, monitor and disrupt illicit actors and activities that disrupt the safety and prosperity\" of the US and will help \"disrupt narcotics trafficking\" and criminal groups in the region. The carrier group is joining substantial military forces already deployed in the region, including thousands of troops, a nuclear-powered submarine and military aircraft based in Puerto Rico. Collectively, they form the largest US presence arrayed in and around Latin America in decades. The US has continued to launch strikes on alleged drug boats in the region. The Trump administration says the attacks are necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the US. Earlier this week, the US announced it had conducted two additional strikes in the Pacific, killing six people. In addition to fueling tensions with the governments of Colombia and Venezuela, the strikes have led to concerns from some observers about violations of human rights and due process. Colombia's Petro has also faced criticism as well as US sanctions over his reluctant response to drug-trafficking groups. On Tuesday, Colombia's military officers revealed that they had launched their own deadly airstrikes against a drug-running guerrilla group in the Amazon region, killing 19, AFP reported.Earlier in November, Trump downplayed suggestions he was planning to topple the Venezuelan government or start a war. In an interview with CBS - the BBC's US news partner - Trump said that \"every single boat that you see that's shot down kills 25,000 on drugs and destroys families all over our country.\"Pushed on whether the US was planning any strikes on land, Trump refused to rule it out, saying: \"I wouldn't be inclined to say that I would do that... I'm not gonna tell you what I'm gonna do with Venezuela, if I was gonna do it or if I wasn't going to do it.\" ",

    "body": "8 hours agoCaroline Davies,Pakistan correspondent, Islamabad and Dearbail JordanPakistan: Suicide attack outside Islamabad court kills 12A suicide attack outside a court in Pakistan's capital Islamabad has killed 12 people and injured at least 27 others, the country's interior minister said.Mohsin Naqvi said a bomber was planning to attack the district courthouse but was unable to get inside.Naqvi said authorities would prioritise identifying the bomber, and that those involved would be brought to justice.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has alleged that extremist groups \"actively backed by India\" were involved.A spokesperson for the Indian government denied what they described as \"baseless and unfounded allegations\".In a statement, Sharif said that \"terrorist attacks on unarmed citizens of Pakistan by India's terrorist proxies are condemnable\".Jumaat Ul Ahrar, a splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), has claimed responsibility, according to local media. But two local journalists have told the BBC that the TTP's central leadership has sent messages to them saying it has no link to the explosion.Suicide blasts in Islamabad have been rare in recent years. Footage from the scene on Tuesday showed the remains of a burnt-out car and a police cordon in place.The 27 people injured are receiving medical treatment, Naqvi said.He added that the attacker detonated the bomb close to a police car after waiting for up to 15 minutes. Footage of the aftermath showed plumes of smoke rising from a charred vehicle behind a security barrier. The incident occurred at 12:39 local time (07:39 GMT).Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari said he \"strongly condemned the suicide blast\". A lawyer who said he was parking his car outside the court at the time described hearing a \"loud bang\".Rustam Malik told AFP news agency \"it was complete chaos\".\"Lawyers and people were running inside the complex,\" he added. \"I saw two dead bodies lying on the gate and several cars were on fire.\"Police cordoned off an area close to a district court in Islamabad after the blastIn a separate incident on Monday, a car exploded in India's capital Delhi, killing eight people and injuring a number of others. The Indian government has not called the incident a terror attack, although the case has been referred to the country's anti-terror body.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said following the attack: \"The conspirators behind this heinous act will not be spared. All those responsible will be brought to justice, no matter how deep the conspiracy runs.\"There is, however, no official word yet on what led to the blast.The last time Pakistan's capital was targeted by a suicide bombing was three years ago when a police officer was killed and several others injured.There have been suicide attacks in other parts of the country in the years since but not in Islamabad.

    "body": "7 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent  , JerusalemAFPHamas wants its fighters in Rafah to be given safe passage, which has so far been rejected by Israel (file photo)US President Donald Trump's envoy and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, returned to Israel on Monday, as mediators face a new obstacle in their efforts to advance negotiations on the fragile Gaza ceasefire deal to the next and more complex phase.Key sticking points remain unresolved, including Hamas's disarmament, the reconstruction and future governance of Gaza, and the deployment of an international security force to the territory.Without a timeline for the discussions, which are likely to require significant concessions from both Israel and Hamas, there are doubts that any progress can be achieved.Another challenge has emerged recently, involving scores of Hamas fighters believed to be in tunnels beneath the southern city of Rafah behind the so-called \"Yellow Line\", which marks the area under Israeli control.Israel GPO via EPAJared Kushner (2nd L) and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (2nd R) held talks in Jerusalem on MondayLast week, US special envoy Steve Witkoff said an amnesty could be offered for fighters who laid down their arms, and that this could be a \"model\" for what Washington hoped to apply in the rest of Gaza.Witkoff said 200 fighters were trapped, although this number has not been confirmed.According to media reports, Kushner and the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, discussed the issue during a meeting in Jerusalem on Monday.Hamas has previously said the fighters will not surrender and demanded that they are given safe passage, which has so far been rejected by Israel.An Israeli government spokeswoman said Netanyahu and Kushner had \"discussed phase one, which we are currently still in, to bring our remaining hostages, and the future of phase two of this plan, which includes the disarming of Hamas, demilitarising Gaza, and ensuring Hamas will have no role in the future of Gaza ever again\".The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.Since then, more than 69,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures the UN considers reliable.The first phase of the ceasefire, which came into force last month, focused on halting the war, returning all hostages, and securing a surge in humanitarian aid into Gaza.Twenty living hostages and the remains of 24 deceased captives have been released, with four bodies remaining in Gaza.In return, Israel has freed 250 Palestinian prisoners from its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza who were being held without charge or trial. It has also handed over the remains of 315 Palestinians from Gaza.Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating the truce, with Israel saying Hamas has deliberately delayed the return of the remains of hostages and Hamas saying that Israel has killed at least 240 Palestinians and is restricting the entry of aid supplies.Watch: BBC's Lucy Williamson taken to east of Gaza City in IDF-led visitHamas has previously rejected disarmament, saying it would only do so once a Palestinian state has been established. Israel refuses any involvement in the governance of Gaza by the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, which is the body that governs parts of the occupied West Bank. Countries are reluctant to commit troops to the multinational force without clear goals, concerned that their soldiers might end up confronting fighters from Hamas and other Palestinian factions.The Israeli military currently occupies 53% of Gaza's territory and is expected to withdraw further in the next stage of the plan.With no indication of imminent advances in the negotiations, a de-facto partition of Gaza between the area controlled by Israel and another ruled by Hamas was increasingly likely, sources told the Reuters news agency, with talks about reconstruction apparently likely to be limited to the Israel-controlled territory.Arab countries have already expressed concerns that the current separation could become a permanent partition of Gaza.The Trump plan does not include a pathway to Palestinian statehood - a concept which Israel rejects.",

    "body": "21 hours agoKelly Ng,Singapore, Jonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent and Lulu Luo,Cabanatuan, PhilippinesAt least six people have died after a super typhoon barrelled through the Philippines, mere days after an earlier storm left more than 200 people dead.Super typhoon Fung-wong brought floods and landslides, which caused most of the deaths. It also cut power across entire provinces. It later weakened into a typhoon. More than 1.4 million people were evacuated ahead of it making landfall in the Philippines. It is now heading for Taiwan, where more than 3,000 people have been evacuated.Fung-wong was the 21st typhoon to hit the South East Asian nation this year, at a time where many residents are still struggling to recover from back-to-back natural disasters.Fung-wong, known locally as Uwan, slammed into Aurora province on Luzon Sunday night with sustained winds of around 185 km/h (115mph) and gusts of 230km/h.The Philippines' meteorological service had earlier warned of destructive winds and \"high-risk of life-threatening\" storm surges from the \"very intense\" typhoon.In Cabanatuan, one of the worst-hit cities, the BBC saw residents rushing into their homes to pull out furniture and pets on Monday, desperate to salvage as many of their possessions possible as water levels rose.Although its wind speeds did not come up to par with some of the strongest storms in the Philippines' history, Fung-wong dumped large amounts of rain on the country, leaving some 4,100 houses either totally destroyed or partially damaged.Cabanatuan resident Mercidita Adriano and her family had trimmed trees near their home last week to prepare for the storm.When the winds and rain intensified, ten of them crowded into a small room, praying throughout the day that the typhoon would spare their house, she told the BBC. Part of their roof was torn off by the heavy rain.Large parts of the country are still under water although the levels have gone down as of Tuesday morning. It comes just days after typhoon Kalmaegi ripped through the same region, leaving tens of thousands of people reeling. And in September, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake hit the province of Cebu.While the Philippines is prone to natural disasters, this series of catastrophes is \"not routine\", the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in a statement on Sunday.\"It is a stark reminder of the escalating climate and seismic risks faced by vulnerable nations. Urgent support is needed to scale up relief efforts, prevent further loss of life and support the country as it recovers from this latest disaster,\" it said. ",

    "body": "'There was blood everywhere': Delhi residents recount horror of huge car explosion17 hours agoVikas Pandey and Antriksha PathaniaBBC News, DelhiBBCMohammed Azghar says that his brother has been missing since the blastMonday evening was busy as usual near the Red Fort metro station in India's capital Delhi when the sound of a loud blast broke through the cacophony on the streets.An explosion in a car killed at least eight people and injured more than 20. It was so powerful that several vehicles nearby almost melted, and people could hear the blast from kilometres away.The police are still investigating what caused the blast but the fact that it happened in one of the most secure and busy areas of Delhi has shocked people.On one side is Chandni Chowk - a busy trading and clothing hub that is busier than usual at this time of the year due to the peak wedding season.And on the other side is the 17th Century Red Fort which attracts thousands of tourists every day.Sandwiched between the two is the road where the explosion took place. Within minutes, confusion and alarm spread from the scene to the rest of the city.Some readers may find the details below disturbingMohamed Hafiz, who lives less than 200m from the spot, said his house shook and he and others ran out thinking it was an earthquake.What he saw on the street terrified him: people were running in all directions, cars were on fire, and bodies lay on the road. Some locals were trying to help the injured.\"There was blood everywhere. People were in shock. The scene was too disturbing - I could even see body parts,\" he said.As local media broke the news, fear and panic swept through the city. Police declared a high alert, and neighbouring states quickly followed suit.ReutersA member from the forensic team investigates the area where the blast took placeAs we entered Delhi from the neighbouring suburb of Noida, we could see a long queue of vehicles at the border as policemen searched them one by one.Everyone - the people in the vehicles and the policemen - looked tense as they all appeared to be in disbelief that something like this had happened in their city for the first time in more than a decade.Beyond the crossing, most roads were deserted as we drove to Lok Nayak Hospital, where the injured had been taken. Outside, a large crowd had gathered behind police cordons. Confusion hung in the air as people searched for answers, and fellow journalists speculated about what might have caused the explosion.Onlookers were mystified and even scared. Rajesh Kumar, who works at a tea shop near the hospital, said he always believed the capital was the safest city in the country.He said that though the blast had shaken him, he still believed that the security forces would soon find out what caused it.\"My family in Uttar Pradesh [state] told me to leave, they panic easily. I am a little worried and shocked but I don't think Delhi has suddenly become unsafe,\" he said.Among the crowd were also several people who were looking for missing family members.One of them was Mohammed Azghar, whose brother was in the area where the blast took place.\"My brother has been missing since the explosion. We haven't had any contact with him,\" he said.\"We've searched around Red Fort, Chandni Chowk, everywhere but we can't find him.\"Mr Azghar said his brother used to drive an electric rickshaw. \"The police have confiscated the vehicle, which is fine, we don't mind that. But at least help us find my brother.\"I just want some news - good or bad.\"The injured were taken to Lok Nayak Hospital in DelhiAfter visiting the hospital, we drove to the site of the blast. It was jarring to see the roads empty here, as the area is usually teeming with people late into the night.There were only security personnel or journalists around. Officials had relaxed restrictions and journalists could go closer to the site.The scene there told the story of the blast. There were mangled remains of cars, rickshaws and tuk-tuks. Blood stains could still be seen on the road. Some of the vehicles were charred beyond recognition.Some locals had also gathered around. They looked visibly shaken and worried about their immediate future.Ram Singh, who drives a small vehicle to ferry goods from stockrooms to shops in the area, is worried about business being affected.\"I earn daily and I am worried how I might feed my family. I hope a sense of security soon returns. I hope the police will be able to restore trust fairly quickly,\" he said.\"And I hope this never happens in our city ever again. We are shaken but we should overcome this.\"",

    "body": "Harshita was murdered a year ago - so why has her killer not been caught, family ask2 days agoYogita LimayeSouth Asia and Afghanistan correspondentFamily handoutHarshita Brella's body was discovered in the boot of a car in London on 14 November last yearOne year since Harshita Brella was strangled to death in the UK, there is a sense of disbelief in her family home in the Indian capital Delhi.\"Why has her killer not been caught yet? Neither the UK government nor the Indian government are doing anything,\" Harshita's mother Sudesh Kumari says, sobbing into her scarf. \"I want justice for my daughter. Only then will I find peace.\"Harshita's body was found in the boot of a car in Ilford, east London, on 14 November 2024, a day after her family contacted UK police to say they had not heard from her since 10 November.Police believe Harshita, 24, was murdered on that day in Corby, Northamptonshire,  by her husband Pankaj Lamba, who fled to India soon after the killing and is still on the run.The couple, both Indian nationals, had moved from Delhi to the UK, settling in Corby, earlier that year.Northamptonshire PoliceA CCTV picture of the murder suspect Pankaj LambaIn March this year, police in Northamptonshire charged him with murder. He also faces charges of rape, sexual assault and controlling or coercive behaviour.Harshita's sister Sonia Dabas is frustrated with the pace of investigations.\"We are very disappointed with the UK police. Maybe because we are not citizens of the UK, that's why they are not serious about this case. They are sending out a message that foreign nationals are not safe in the UK,\" she told the BBC.Roughly two months before Harshita was killed, on 3 September, she had filed a case of domestic abuse against her husband. He was arrested and later released on bail on condition that he did not harass, pester or intimidate Harshita. The Domestic Violence Protection Order (DVPO) expired four weeks later, on 1 October.Sonia accuses Northamptonshire Police of being negligent in following up on the domestic abuse case. \"That's when Pankaj figured out that the UK police are not really serious about this case and he felt he could get away with murder,\" she says.Four officers of the Northamptonshire Police are being investigated over their handling of Harshita's domestic abuse report and their interaction with her, by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).The IOPC told the BBC this week that their investigation was complete and had been shared with Northamptonshire Police. Northamptonshire Police say they have been given until mid-November to respond to the IOPC's findings.Northamptonshire Police said: \"This is an exceptionally complex case and with criminal proceedings now active in the UK, we are unable to go into detail about the investigation at this time. However, we can confirm that the Indian authorities have been made aware through the appropriate channels of the charging decision.\"The Indian government has told the BBC they are in touch with the UK government on the matter, but neither side answered clearly about whether an extradition notice for Pankaj Lamba had been forwarded to the Indian authorities.Ms Brella detailed the alleged abuse she suffered at the hands of her husband in a letterHarshita's family also told the BBC that they believe Pankaj Lamba is in India, being shielded by Indian police.\"He has relatives who are policemen. In March this year, he was seen on CCTV footage withdrawing money from a bank. Then how come he's not been found yet? This is all because of corruption,\" says Sonia. The family also says they have information that in the early months of this year, Pankaj was running a shop in Gurgaon, not far from where they live.\"They [the Delhi Police] are just killing time,\" Sonia says.The Delhi Police did not respond to Sonia's accusations. They told the BBC that they have acted on the basis of a dowry complaint filed by Harshita's parents against Mr Lamba and members of his family, including his parents and sister, who were arrested and are now out on bail. The Delhi Police also say they issued public notices earlier this year offering a reward for information about Mr Lamba, and the search for him is still under way.Harshita's mother Sudesh Kumari says she still cannot believe her daughter is gonePankaj Lamba's family home is in the village of Dharauli, about 40 miles (65km) north of Delhi, and not far from Gurgaon where Ms Brella's family believe he was sighted in March. His parents Sudesh and Darshan Lamba didn't want to be interviewed when the BBC visited. But they rejected all the charges against them and their son. They claim they have not had any contact with him since 10 November 2024 – the same day that Harshita's family last had contact with her.For Harshita's father, Satbir Singh Brella, the days are filled with visits to police stations and courts.\"My daughter was so straightforward, and kind hearted. A really terrible thing happened to her,\" he says.Her mother points to the shoes she's wearing. They're Harshita's and were among her possessions from the UK returned to her family by British officials who visited them in July.\"They are tight for me, but I feel close to her when I wear them,\" says Sudesh Kumari. \"Sometimes I feel she's still in the UK, I cannot believe she is gone.\"Additional reporting: Aakriti Thapar, Adnan Bhat, Sanjay Ganguly",

    "body": "Ghana's Asante king has welcomed the return of 130 gold and bronze artefacts from the UK and South Africa some of which were looted during colonial times and others bought on the open market.The items included royal regalia, drums and ceremonial gold weights, dating back to the 1870s - and reveal the cultural role gold played in Asante society.Twenty-five of the pieces were donated by British art historian Hermione Waterfield and the rest by South African mining company AngloGold Ashanti.Handing over the pieces at a ceremony at the Manhyia Palace, in the city of Kumasi, officials from AngloGold Ashanti said the gesture was made as an act of cultural respect and reconciliation.There have been tensions in the central Ashanti region between AngloGold Ashanti and residents, who have accused the company of exploiting mineral resources without doing much to develop the area or create jobs.Asante King Otumfuo Osei Tutu II thanked AngloGold Ashanti for voluntarily returning artefacts legitimately acquired on open markets.It reflected \"goodwill and respect for the source and legacy of the Asante kingdom\", the monarch said.The reception took place on Sunday, according to a statement released after the event from the palace.Ms Waterfield was a pioneering figure and curator at Christie's auction house in London and took a special interest in African art, establishing a department that focused on tribal art in the 1970s.She has long been a supporter of West African art restitution.According to Manhyia Palace Museum director Ivor Agyeman-Duah, Ms Waterfield's gifts included a wooden drum looted during the 1900 siege of Kumasi by British colonial forces.British soldiers were involved in a series of conflicts in the late 19th Century in what were called the Anglo-Asante wars. The palace of the king, or Asantehene, was plundered twice.The call by African countries for the return of looted items has been met with some success in recent years - though some items are only on loan.Last year, 32 looted artefacts went on display at the Manhyia Palace Museum as part of a three-year loan agreement between two British museums - the Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A) and British Museum - and the Asante king.In 2022, Germany was the first country to return Benin bronzes to Nigeria in a bid to deal with its \"dark colonial history\".They were looted by British troops in 1897 from the West African kingdom of Benin, in modern-day Nigeria's Edo state - and many were auctioned off in London and are in collections all over the world.",

    "body": "3 days agoNick ThorpeBudapest, HungaryOn the surface, the Hungarian prime minister's trip was exactly what he went to Washington for: luxuriant praise and an exemption from sanctions on Russian oil, gas and nuclear supplies.And all that just five months out from a difficult election.Look closer, however, and the picture is less clear cut. The US side struck a hard trade deal - and an expensive one for Hungary. And there's no progress on Viktor Orban's biggest headache: ending the war in neighbouring Ukraine, and with it the long shadow the conflict casts over Hungary.Let's look first at Orban's key win - an exemption from US sanctions, which a White House official told the BBC was time-limited to one year, although Péter Szijjártó, Hungary's foreign minister, said would be indefinite.The time span is interesting. Trump clearly wants to help his friend win the election in April. And the exemption even partially dovetails with the European Commission demand to all member states to end the import of Russian oil, gas and nuclear fuel by the end of 2027. What is missing, from an EU perspective, is any political commitment from Orban to meet that demand - a commitment made and fulfilled by the Czech government. And the EU is trying to tighten energy sanctions - to the fury of Hungary and Slovakia.Away from the media spotlight, the Hungarian energy company MOL has been upgrading two of its refineries - Százhalombatta in Hungary and the Slovnaft facility in Bratislava - to process Brent crude instead of the high-sulphur Urals crude which flows through Russian pipelines. On Friday, MOL said 80% of its oil needs could be imported through the Adria pipeline from Croatia, albeit with higher logistical costs and technical risks. So Orban's argument, which so impressed Trump, that Hungary, as a landlocked country, has no alternative to Russian oil may not strictly be true. Overall, Hungary and Slovakia have together paid Russia $13bn (£10bn) for its oil between its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the end of 2024. The one-year window granted by the US is nevertheless a valuable respite for Hungarian households this winter. Orban told pro-government reporters who travelled with him to Washington that otherwise utility bills \"could have gone up by up to three times in December\". Capping those bills by various means has been a central plank of his popularity in Hungary since 2013. Under the US exemption, Hungary can also continue to buy Russian gas through the Turkstream pipeline, which traverses the Balkans, and pay for it in hard currency ($185m in August alone) using a Bulgarian loophole. Orban has agreed to buy LNG from the US worth $600 million, according to Bloomberg.Another key part of the Washington deal is nuclear. Hungary agreed to buy US nuclear fuel rods for its Paks 1 nuclear power station (at a cost of $114m), in parallel to those bought from Russia's Rosatom and France's Framatome.Russian plans to finance and build the nuclear extension, called Paks 2, have been long delayed by technical and licensing issues. The US agreement to lift all nuclear sanctions on Hungary may help restart that project, but thorny problems remain. Hungary has also agreed to buy US technology to extend the short-term storage of spent nuclear fuel at Paks for between $100m and $200m.Perhaps the biggest part of the deal was a Hungarian commitment to buy up to 10 small modular nuclear reactors from the US, for somewhere between $10bn and $20bn. Hungary needs electricity to power the huge Chinese battery plants being built around the country. Smaller nuclear plants are less plagued by building delays, and are easier to licence.Finally, a currency swap deal - similar to a recent US-Argentina deal to prop up the peso - under which US and Hungarian central banks can exchange currency is being discussed.This would mean that in a future financial crisis in Hungary, the US central bank could feed dollars to Budapest, which boosts financial security in Hungary.So in summary, Hungary struck a deal to buy US gas, nuclear energy and unspecified weapons systems in exchange for a temporary waiver from US sanctions on Russian oil and gas. But it failed to get the re-introduction of the US-Hungary dual taxation system, abolished in 2022, which harms mutual trade. And it did not get a new date for a potential Trump-Putin summit in Budapest as part of efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war.Critics say energy dependence on Russia is being replaced by energy dependence on the US. The Orban government argues it is achieving greater diversity of supply.",

    "body": "12 hours agoJude SheerinGetty ImagesTexas Democrat Greg Casar has warned against healthcare \"betrayal\"A day after the US Senate passed a spending bill to end the longest-ever government shutdown, the budget fight now moves to the House of Representatives.The lower chamber of Congress is expected to vote this week on the funding measure. Unlike in the Senate, if House Republicans stay united, they don't need any Democrats to pass the budget. But the margin for error is razor thin.Here are four potential hold-ups for the budget, before it can clear Congress and land on the president's desk for signing into law.Will House Republicans budge on healthcare?A key sticking point throughout the shutdown has been a desire on the part of Democrats to attach to the spending bill a renewal of tax credits that make health insurance less expensive for 24 million Americans.Senate Republicans instead only agreed to grant Democrats a vote in December on whether to extend the subsidies –  something they had already offered weeks ago.And House Speaker Mike Johnson would not commit on Monday to allowing a vote in his chamber on the tax credits.This entails a fair degree of political risk for Republicans, however. If they torpedo the subsidies, health coverage premiums could rocket, handing Democrats a ready-made campaign issue for next year's midterm elections.Marjorie Taylor Greene, a conservative Republican congresswoman from Georgia, has broken ranks with President Donald Trump to warn that her party must ensure health insurance premiums do not spike.As the clock ticks down to the subsidies expiring by the end of December, Republicans are working out their plan.They want income caps on who can receive the tax credits, and are proposing the tax dollars bypass insurance companies and go straight to individuals - although the details are unclear.Watch: Moment US Senate approves bill that could end government shutdownHow intense will House Democratic opposition be?Out of power in Washington, where Trump's Republicans control the House and Senate, Democrats appeared finally to have some political wind in their sails after a handful of election wins last week in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City.But those victories, like the shutdown fight, have accentuated strategic tensions between the pragmatic and progressive, or left-wing, factions of the party.The Democratic left is furious at defectors who voted with Senate Republicans to pass the budget on Monday, seeing this as a capitulation to Trump.From that wing of the party, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said giving up the fight was a \"horrific mistake\". California Governor Gavin Newsom called it \"surrender\".Congressman Greg Casar of Texas, the chairman of the House Progressive Caucus, warned: \"A deal that doesn't reduce healthcare costs is a betrayal of millions of Americans counting on Democrats to fight for them.\"However, centrist lawmakers like Jared Golden of Maine, who represents one of the most conservative districts in the nation held by any Democrat, may cross the aisle.Golden, who recently announced he won't run for re-election, is likely to vote for the package, his office indicated to Axios, a political outlet, on Monday.Another moderate Democrat, Henry Cuellar of Texas, could help get the Republicans' spending plan over the line.\"It's past time to put country over party and get our government working again for the American people,\" he posted on social media on Sunday.ReutersRepublican Thomas Massie has repeatedly voted against stopgap funding extensionsDo Republicans have the votes?Republicans control the House, holding 219 seats against the Democrats' 213, but can only afford to lose two votes to pass the spending plan.While most House Republicans are expected to support the funding package, given that Trump backs it, fiscal hawks in the party will raise objections.Thomas Massie of Kentucky - who has repeatedly voted against such stopgap funding extensions - is expected to vote no.The proposed deal would leave the federal government on a path to keep adding about $1.8tn (£1.4tn) a year to its $38tn of debt.Rand Paul of Kentucky cited this spending glut as he became the only Republican in the Senate to vote against the budget.The Senate plan would extend funding only until January, but the conservative House Freedom Caucus wants a budget that would last longer and do more to rein in spending.\"Government, just do your job\" - Frustration at airports as shutdown delays continueWill travel chaos delay the return to Washington?House Speaker Mike Johnson has kept the chamber out of session for the last seven weeks to focus pressure on Senate Democrats to make a shutdown deal.Now he is urging lawmakers to start returning immediately to Washington with a vote set for Wednesday afternoon at the earliest.But members of Congress face the same flight delays that have plagued other Americans during the spending impasse.From Tuesday, the rate of reduction in US flights will increase to 6%. Cuts have been made as the nation's busiest airports reduce their capacity to cope with shutdown-related sickness by air traffic controllers, who have been working without pay during the shutdown. Record-cold temperatures and heavy snow have also hit the Great Lakes region in the Midwest, adding to the delays.",

    "body": "Trove of records reveals Kenya's forgotten World War soldiers4 days agoWedaeli ChibelushiNational Army MuseumThousands of Kenyan soldiers fought in the British army during the world warsOne day, some 85 years ago, Mutuku Ing'ati left his home in southern Kenya and was never seen again.The 30-something Mr Ing'ati had disappeared with no explanation - for years his family desperately tried to track him down, following lead after lead that would eventually dry up.As decades passed, memories of Mr Ing'ati faded. He had no children and many of those close to him passed away. But then, roughly eight decades later, his name re-emerged in British military records.The Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), which works to commemorate those who died in the two world wars, contacted Mr Ing'ati's nephew, Benjamin Mutuku, after mining old documents.He learnt that on the day his uncle left his village, Syamatani, he travelled roughly 180km (110 miles) westwards to Nairobi - the seat of the British colonial government then in control of the country.There, he signed up as a private with the East African Scouts, a regiment in the British army that fought in World War Two. The UK recruited millions of men from its empire to fight in both of the 20th Century's global conflicts in theatres across the world.Mr Ing'ati responded to the call for recruits - when exactly is not clear - and then on 13 June 1943, he was killed in action, according to the records unearthed by CWGC. Where and how he died is not known.CWGC/Kenyan Defence Force/British LibraryA document lists some of those who enlisted with the East African ScoutsLike thousands of Kenyans who fought in the British army, he died without his family being notified and was buried in a location unknown to this day.Decades on, as the UK marks Remembrance Sunday to honour those who contributed to the war effort, the sacrifices of many Kenyan soldiers, like Mr Ing'ati, remain unrecognised. The world knows little of their service and they were not formally commemorated in the way their white counterparts were.After all these years, Mr Mutuku was pleased to learn where his uncle had disappeared to and when he died. Despite being born after Mr Ing'ati left the village, Mr Mutuku feels a strong connection to his uncle, from whom he got his name.\"I used to ask my father, where is the person I was named after?\" Mr Mutuku, now 67, tells the BBC.Although he welcomes the fresh information, Mr Mutuku feels angry that his uncle's body is somewhere out in the world, and not buried in Syamatani.His family are from the Akamba ethnic group, who believe being laid to rest near the family home is very important.\"I never got a chance to see a tomb where my uncle got buried,\" Mr Mutuku says. \"I would have liked so much to see that.\"Nellyson MutukuBenjamin Mutuku, named after his uncle Mutuku Ing'ati, wants more answers about where and how he diedThe CWGC is trying to find out where Mr Ing'ati died and where his body is, along with the details of other forgotten Kenyan soldiers.A search is also on for details about East Africans who fought and died during World War One.With help from the Kenyan Defence Forces, the CWGC recently unearthed a treasure trove of rare colonial military records in Kenya dating from that conflict. As a result researchers have been able to recover the names and stories of more than 3,000 soldiers who served at that time.The records, thought to have been destroyed decades ago, concern the King's African Rifles. Comprised of East African soldiers, the regiment fought against  German troops in the region, in what is now Tanzania in World War One, and Japanese troops in what is now Myanmar in World War Two.\"These are not just dusty files - they are personal stories. For many African families, this may be the first time they learn about a relative's wartime service,\" George Hay, a historian at the CWGC, tells the BBC.For example, there is George Williams, a decorated sergeant major with the Kings African Rifles. Described as 5ft 8in (170cm) with a scar on the right side of his chin, Mr Williams received several medals for gallantry and was recognised as a first-class shot. He died, aged 44, in Mozambique just four months before the war ended.There are also records for Abdulla Fadlumulla, a Ugandan soldier who enlisted with the King's African Rifles in 1913, aged only 16. He was killed just 13 months later, while assaulting an enemy position in Tanzania.CWGC/Kenyan Defence Force/British LibraryResearch has unearthed thousands of old military documentsThe records demonstrate how the wars \"touched every fabric in Kenya\", Patrick Abungu, a historian at CWGC's Kenya office, says.\"Because the narrative is, they went and never came back. And now we are answering those questions: where they went and where [their bodies] could be,\" he adds.The historian wants to answer these questions for thousands of families across Kenya - his own included.His great uncle, Ogoyi Ogunde, was conscripted into the British army during World War One and never returned home.\"It's very traumatic to lose a loved one and not know where they are,\" he tells the BBC.\"It does not matter how many years go by, people will always look at the gate and hope that he will walk in one day.\"Mr Abungu and the CWGC hope to build memorials to finally commemorate the thousands of soldiers identified from the newly discovered documents. National Army MuseumSoldiers in the King's African Rifles, pictured here in 1914, fought in battlefields across the worldThe organisation also wants the records to help inform Kenya's school curriculum, so that new generations come to understand the outsized, yet overlooked role Africans played in the world wars.  \"The only way any of this matters is that it isn't coming from people like me saying, 'This is your history',\" CWGC's Mr Hay says.\"It's about people saying, 'This is our history' - and using the materials that we're working with.\"The CWGC will continue recovering the details of Kenyan individuals who served in the British forces until every fallen soldier is commemorated.\"There is no end date... I mean this could go on for 1,000 years,\" Mr Abungu says.\"The process that is taking place is ensuring that those thousands of people who went away and never came back... we keep their memories going so that we don't forget them.\"You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

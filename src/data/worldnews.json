    "body": "3 hours agoTabby WilsonGetty ImagesAn Italian mayor has apologised to the family of opera star Luciano Pavarotti after the town of Pesaro encased a statue honouring the late singer within a Christmas ice rink. The singer's widow, Nicoletta Mantovani, told local media that she was \"angry and upset\" at what she called the decision to \"ridicule\" her late husband. The temporary ice rink was constructed in the centre of the town's piazza, leaving Pavrotti's statue knee-deep in ice and surrounded by perspex walls. In response, Biancini said that he didn't mean to offend anyone, and admitted that his council had \"made a mistake\".Before it was opened on 29 November, Mayor Andrea Biancani posted a doctored image of Pavarotti's statue playing ice hockey with the hashtag #DaiUnCinqueAPavarotti, which translates to \"Give a high-five to Pavarotti\".\"I didn't expect a town would allow this treatment of the memory and the image of a person who made Italy great around the world,\" Ms Mantovani told local outlet Il Resto del Carlino. She accused the council of making a \"poorly executed, absurd decision\". The life-size bronze statue was officially unveiled in Pesaro in April 2024, with Ms Mantovani and the couple's daughter, Alice, in attendance. The couple often holidayed in Pesaro, where Pavarotti had a villa and was an honorary citizen.Biancini told Il Resto del Carlino, which nicknamed the incident \"Pavarotti on Ice\", that when plans for the ice rink were initially presented to him, he was assured that the Pavarotti statue would not be touched and that it was only later that he found out designers had been forced to alter their construction. He said it would not be possible to dismantle the rink or move the statue at this late stage, but insisted that it would \"not happen again\".Pavarotti was an Italian tenor, and is widely known as one of the most successful opera stars of all time.His performances in the Three Tenors concerts were seen around the world, and his rendition of Nessun Dorma, from Puccini's Turandot, which he performed at the 1990 football World Cup in Italy.His final performance was at the opening of the Winter Olympics in Turin in February 2006.He died the following year at the age of 71, after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Pavarotti left behind four daughters from his two marriages. Ms Mantovani was his second wife. She remarried, to financial advisor Alberto Tinarelli, in 2020. ",

Police searched them and found \"magnetised probes\" and a mirror attachment for a phone allegedly used to rig games.The pair have been charged with dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage and remain in custody.New South Wales Police said the couple had arrived in Sydney from Kazakhstan in October and applied for membership to the casino the same day.Over the following weeks, they made a number of visits to the casino - reportedly the Crown on Sydney's waterfront - and accumulated winnings totalling A$1,179,412.50.This raised the suspicions of casino staff, who allegedly caught them in the act on Thursday.Police said the spying devices were connected to the couple's mobile phones, allowing them to capture and view images of the table.NSW PoliceCasino staff noticed Dilnoza Israilova wearing the small, discreet camera on her Mickey Mouse T-shirtThey also wore hidden earpieces, through which they allegedly received instructions on when to wager on card games.

    "body": "One of the four sons of notorious Mexican drug kingpin Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán has pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges in a US court. Joaquín Guzmán López's guilty plea on Monday comes after US prosecutors pledged last May to not pursue the death penalty against him.   Lopez, 39, is a member of Los Chapitos, a cell made up of El Chapo's children, including his brother Ovidio, who pleaded guilty in July to drug trafficking, firearms and money laundering charges.Their father, who was one of the founders of the Sinaloa drugs cartel, is serving a life sentence in Colorado.US prosecutors say the brothers rose to become the leaders of the drug cartel after the arrest of their father. Lopez was arrested last year alongside cartel boss Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada after landing a private plane in Texas.Officials have said that Lopez helped trick Zambada into boarding the plane, having led him to believe he was travelling to northern Mexico to look at prospective properties for clandestine airstrips.As part of the plea deal, Lopez admitted to helping oversee the production and smuggling of large quantities of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana and fentanyl into the US.Fentanyl, which is over 50 times more powerful than heroin, is the leading cause of deaths in the US for people aged 18 to 45. Lopez's guilty plea comes as the Trump administration faces pressure from Congress to justify its missile strikes on alleged drug traffickers at sea. Trump has moved to designate the cartels as terrorist organisations, and says the strikes are needed to prevent drug deaths in the US. Critics have called them extra-judicial killings, and say they may violate international treaties governing war.Meanwhile on Sunday, Mexico authorities announced that they had killed a well-known drug trafficker who was wanted in the US. Pedro \"Pichon\" Inzunza Coronel, who was one of the country's top fentanyl traffickers, was involved in multiple crimes, including \"murders, kidnappings, torture, and violent debt collection for drug trafficking\", according to US Ambassador to Mexico Ronald Johnson.\"These results reflect what our nations can achieve when they work together against those who pose a threat to our citizens,\" Johnson wrote on X.",

    "body": "More than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israel's military campaign in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The death toll has continued to rise since a ceasefire took effect on 10 October, with Israel carrying out air strikes for what it says are violations of the truce - while bodies continue to be recovered from under the rubble.Among those reportedly killed in an Israeli drone strike on Saturday were two young brothers, Fadi and Juma Abu Assi, whose family said they had been gathering firewood when they were killed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC they had struck two suspects who had crossed the so-called yellow line.The line marks where the Israeli military agreed to withdraw to under a ceasefire brokered by the United States more than seven weeks ago.The boys who died have been described in media reports as an eight-year-old and his brother, aged 10 or 11.Relatives said the children had been looking for firewood east of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip when they were killed.Their funeral was held at Nasser Hospital on Saturday.Figures from the Gaza Ministry of Health (MoH) have been widely used throughout the war and are seen as reliable by the United Nations (UN) and international institutions. But Israel has consistently disputed data published by Gaza's authorities.International journalists, including the BBC, are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently, so are unable to verify figures from either side.Gaza's Health Ministry says the Palestinian toll is now 70,100 and that more than 350 of those deaths have happened since the 10 October ceasefire. The Israeli military launched its offensive on Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",

    "body": "1 hour agoMeryl Sebastian & Abhishek DeyIndia has ordered all new smartphones to come pre-loaded with a non-removable, state-run cybersecurity app, sparking privacy concerns.Under the order - passed last week but made public on Monday - smartphone makers have 90 days to ensure all new devices come with the government's Sanchar Saathi app.It says this is necessary to help citizens verify the authenticity of a handset and report the suspected misuse of telecom resources. The move - which comes in one of the world's largest phone markets, with more than 1.2 billion mobile users - has been criticised by cyber experts, who say it breaches citizens' right to privacy.Launched in January, the Sanchar Saathi app allows users to check a device's IMEI, report lost or stolen phones and flag suspected fraud communications.  An IMEI - the International Mobile Equipment Identity - is a unique 15-digit code that identifies and authenticates a mobile device on cellular networks. The code is  essentially the phone's serial number.In a statement, India's Department of Telecommunications said that mobile handsets with duplicate or spoofed IMEI numbers pose \"serious endangerment\" to telecom cyber security.\"India has big second-hand mobile device market. Cases have also been observed where stolen or blacklisted devices are being re-sold,\" it said, adding that this makes the purchaser an \"abetter in crime and causes financial loss to them\".Under the new rules,  the pre-installed app must be \"readily visible and accessible\" to users when they set up a device and its functionalities cannot be disabled or restricted. Smartphone makers must also \"make an endeavour\" to provide the app through software updates for devices that are out of factories but haven't been sold yet, the statement said. All companies have been asked to give compliance reports on the order in 120 days.The government says the move will bolster telecom cybersecurity. A Reuters report, citing official figures, says the app has helped recover more than 700,000 lost phones - including 50,000 in October alone.But experts say the app's broad permissions raise concerns about how much data it can collect, widening the scope for surveillance.\"In plain terms, this converts every smartphone sold in India into a vessel for state mandated software that the user cannot meaningfully refuse, control, or remove,\" advocacy group Internet Freedom Foundation said in a statement. The design - making the app impossible to disable - would also weaken the safeguards that normally stop one app from accessing another's data, the group said. This, it adds, effectively turns the app into \"a permanent, non-consensual point of access sitting inside the operating system of every Indian smartphone user.\"Technology analyst and writer Prasanto K Roy says the bigger concern is about how much access an app might eventually be allowed on the handset.\"We can't see exactly what it's doing, but we can see that it's asking for a great deal of permissions - potential access to just about everything from flashlight to camera. This is itself worrying,\" he told the BBC. On Google's Play Store, the app says it doesn't collect or share any user data. The BBC has reached out to the department of telecommunications with questions about the app and the privacy concerns related to it.  Mr Roy adds that compliance will be difficult, since the order runs counter to the policies of most handset-makers, including Apple.\"Most companies prohibit installation of any government or third-party app before the sale of a smartphone,\" he says. While India's smartphone market is dominated by Android, Apple's iOS powered an estimated 4.5% of the 735 million smartphones in the country by mid-2025, according to Counterpoint Research. \"Apple has historically refused such requests from governments,\" Tarun Pathak, a research director at Counterpoint, told Reuters.Apple has not commented publicly, but Reuters reports it does not intend to comply and \"will convey its concerns to Delhi.\"India is not the only country to have tightened rules on device verification.In August, Russia ordered all phones and tablets sold in the country to come pre-installed with the state-backed MAX messenger app, sparking similar privacy and surveillance concerns.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "2 hours agoYvette TanVideo shows speed fire spread in Hong Kong high-riseHong Kong's leader John Lee has ordered the creation of an independent committee to investigate the cause of a devastating fire that killed at least 151 people.Last Wednesday, seven of eight tower blocks at the Wang Fuk Court housing complex - which had been undergoing extensive renovations - went up in flames. Investigators have since found that a protective netting used around the buildings failed to meet flame retardant standards. At least 13 people have been arrested for suspected manslaughter, including the directors of a construction company. The fire is the deadliest the city has seen in more than 70 years and the death toll could rise further as officials continue to recover bodies.Chief Executive Lee said that the committee would be led by a judge and would conduct \"comprehensive reform\", adding that he would work to \"prevent similar tragedies from occuring in the future\". Asked at a news conference why he should keep his job, Mr Lee acknowledged that reform was needed but failed to directly address the question. \"Yes, it is a tragedy, it is a big fire. Yes, we need reform. Yes, we have identified failures in different stages. That is exactly why we must act seriously to ensure that all these loopholes are plucked,\" he said. The fire - which spread quickly both upwards and between the blocks - was only fully doused by Friday morning, some 40 hours after it started, and took more than 2,000 firefighters to bring under control.The same day, police began entering the buildings to gather evidence. Authorities say the investigation could take three to four weeks.The flames spread quickly across the separate tower blocks on protective mesh netting and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings, officials have said.Several residents have said they did not hear a fire alarm when the blaze broke out. Hong Kong's fire service found that alarms in all eight blocks were not working effectively.Hong Kong's buildings department has temporarily suspended works on 30 private projects.Getty ImagesThe fire is the deadliest the city has seen in more than 70 yearsSeparately, police reportedly detained a 24-year-old man on suspicion of sedition on Saturday. He was part of a group petitioning for an independent inquiry into the fire. An online petition gathered more than 10,000 signatures in less than a day before its contents were wiped.Two other people, including a former district councillor, were also taken in by police, according to local media reports.Asked about this on Tuesday, Lee did not address the question directly but said that \"criminals that commit offences must be taken to justice\". \"I emphasise I will not tolerate any crimes, particularly crimes that exploit the tragedy that we are facing now.\"Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have both criticised the reported arrests.\"Now is the time for the Hong Kong authorities to transparently investigate the causes of the devastating fire...rather than silencing those who ask legitimate questions,\" Amnesty International said.Getty ImagesChief executive John Lee said that the committee would be led by a judgeWang Fuk Court was built in 1983 and had provided 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census.Nearly 40% of its residents are estimated to be at least 65 years old. Some have lived in the subsidised housing estate since it was built.Hong Kong's second-deadliest fire on record killed 176 people in 1948 and was caused by a ground-floor explosion at a five-storey warehouse. The most deadly was at Happy Valley Racecourse in 1918, when more than 600 people died.",

    "body": "The abrupt cancellations of several Japanese music events in Shanghai - one of them midway through a song - have sparked criticism among fans, with some calling the moves \"rude\" and \"extreme\".Maki Otsuki was halfway through the theme of hit anime One Piece on Friday when the lights and music went off, after which she was rushed off stage by two crew members.On Saturday, pop star Ayumi Hamasaki performed to an empty 14,000-seat stadium after organisers axed her concert in Shanghai, citing \"force majeure\".This spate of cancellations come as diplomatic tensions between Beijing and Tokyo fester over Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's remarks on Taiwan.While responding to a question in parliament last month, Takaichi, known to be a vocal critic of China and its activities in the region, suggested that Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan.Beijing views self-governed Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to \"reunite\" with it.Both sides have since lodged protests against each other, and the rift has also affected daily living in both countries.Otsuki's management attributed the interruption of her performance on Friday to \"unavoidable circumstances\". \"Other than the performance being cancelled, there were no particular problems, and the local staff were very kind and helpful,\" it wrote in a separate statement on Monday, in which it declined interviews on the matter.Her performance was part of a three-day music festival in Shanghai, for which subsequent events were also called off after \"comprehensively taking into consideration various factors\", according to Japan's Kyodo News.The BBC has reached out to Japanese entertainment company Bandai Namco, who is one of the organisers of the festival.Asked about the incident at a daily media conference on Monday, a spokesperson from Beijing's foreign ministry told reporters: \"I suggest you chat with the Chinese organisers.\"Some of Otsuki's fans have made a meme comparing the shutting down of her performance with the shocking removal of China's former leader Hu Jintao during a Communist Party meeting in October 2022. The meme went viral on social media, over the weekend, with some saying Ms Otsuki was given \"the Hu Jintao treatment\".On social media, some accused the Chinese authorities of taking away its own people's freedom to enjoy culture, in its attempts to sanction Japan. \"What's the point of turning the spearhead toward its own citizens?\" read an X post written in Japanese.\"Don't you care about the audience - they are after all Chinese, right?\" wrote a user on China's X-like platform Weibo. George Glass, the United States' ambassador to Japan, joined the conversation online. \"It's truly regrettable that there are people who can't feel the power of music,\" he wrote in an X post which also included a link to Journey's Don't Stop Believin'. \"Maki-san, Don't Stop Believin'—keep holding on to your convictions!\" he wrote.However the incident also fanned nationalist sentiments on Chinese social media, with some asking why the event was allowed in the first place given the diplomatic row. \"How could the event have gone on at a time when the whole nation is angry with Japan?\" a Weibo user wrote.Hamasaki, who was in Shanghai as part of her Asia tour, said she was suddenly asked on Friday to cancel her concert. The pop icon went ahead to perform to 14,000 empty seats as part of her appreciation for the \"people in the company, the Chinese staff, and the large Japanese family that fought through this tour\" she wrote on Instagram.\"I still strongly believe that entertainment should be a bridge that connects people, and I want to be on the side of creating that bridge,\" she wrote.Two weeks ago, Chinese state media announced that the releases of at least two popular Japanese anime films will be postponed amid the diplomatic row.

    "body": "2 days agoDanny AeberhardandTom BennettUkrainian naval drones hit two oil tankers from Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\" as they travelled through the Black Sea, Ukrainian officials have said.Footage verified by the BBC shows waterborne drones speeding through the waves into the vessels, before detonating into a ball of flame, sending black smoke into the air.The targeted tankers were named by Turkish authorities as the Kairos and Virat, both flagged to the Gambia. Both were hit off the Turkish coast on Friday, with the Virat reportedly struck again on Saturday. No casualties were reported. The attacks appear to be an escalation by Kyiv as it tries to hit Russia's oil revenues, which are critical for funding its war in Ukraine.The two ships are reportedly part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" - a term that refers to the hundreds of tankers used by Russia to bypass Western sanctions imposed after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.The shadow fleet is largely made up of aged tankers, many with obscure ownership or insurance.The Kairos was struck in the south-west area of the Black Sea and the Virat in a central area further east. Both are on a list of ships subject to sanctions, according to London Stock Exchange data.The attack employed Sea Baby drones - a type of naval drone produced by Ukraine's security services, known as the SBU.Turkish authorities said they had been assisting the vessels, and released footage showing two Turkish boats trying to extinguish the fire on the Kairos.The attacks are seen as a warning by Ukraine, suggesting that ships carrying Russian oil in the Black Sea face the risk of direct attack, not just Western sanctions.Separately, a major consortium transporting oil from the Caspian region said it had suspended loading in the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, after an attack by unmanned boats overnight.The Caspian Pipeline Consortium said the attack had caused significant damage to a mooring point. Russia and Kazakhstan are major stakeholders in the company, which is also part-owned by Western firms including Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Shell.Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister Aibek Smadiyarov expressed his indignation with the attack, which he said was the third of its kind.He said Kazakhstan attached particular importance to ensuring a \"stable and uninterrupted\" energy supply.The incident had harmed relations between his country and Ukraine, Smadiyarov added, calling on Kyiv \"to take concrete measures to prevent the recurrence of such situations\".Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that a delegation led by top security official Rustem Umerov was on its way to the US to continue talks on an agreement to end the war. Umerov is set to lead the Ukrainian delegation as the previous lead negotiator, Zelensky's influential chief of staff Andriy Yermak, resigned after anti-corruption detectives searched his apartment on Friday. The Ukrainian delegation is expected to meet US officials in Florida on Sunday. Steve Witkoff, US President Donald Trump's overseas envoy, will hold talks in Moscow next week.",

    "body": "12 hours agoHafsa KhalilWatch: Police confirm four dead in California shootingAt least four people, including three children, have been killed in a mass shooting at a children's birthday party in California, authorities say.The victims were eight, nine, 14 and 21 years old, a spokesperson for the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office said. Eleven others were injured - one critically - in the incident at a restaurant in the state's northern city of Stockton.A suspect is still on the loose. Authorities say they believe the shooting may have been \"targeted\" and may have been committed by multiple people.The city's deputy mayor said the attack had occurred \"at a children's birthday party\". Police had previously described the event as a family gathering.Heather Brent, a spokeswoman for the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office, confirmed to BBC News on Monday that the gathering was a children's birthday party. No additional details were provided, but a neighbour told the Los Angeles Times that the party was for a 2-year-old. \"[A] birthday party should never be a place where families fear for their lives,\" Deputy Mayor Jason Lee wrote on social media.The San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office said the shooting happened shortly before 18:00 local time (02:00 GMT on Sunday), and is appealing to anyone with \"information, video footage, or who may have witnessed any part of the incident\" to come forward.Brent described the incident as \"unfathomable\", adding: \"This is a very active and ongoing investigation, and information remains limited.\"Early indications suggest this may be a targeted incident, and investigators are exploring all possibilities.\"Stockton's Mayor Christina Fugazi called the shooting \"unacceptable\". She added: \"Families should be together instead of at the hospital, standing next to their loved one, praying that they survive.\"On Sunday, the mayor said she would match a $10,000 (£7,569) reward for any information leading to an arrest and conviction. Stockton City Councilwoman Mariela Ponce also offered $5,000, bringing the total bounty to $25,000. People who live nearby told local news outlet KCRA 3 they heard gunshots for about a minute, and that they heard more than one person firing. Sheriff Patrick Withrow, also from the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office, said \"we believe... there appears to be multiple shooters\" but that detectives needed to confirm as much.'My brother died in my arms'''Families should be together instead of at the hospital'', says Stockton's mayorOne man, Emmanuel Lopez, told the LA Times that his brother Susano Archuleta was the 21-year-old man who had been killed, saying he had been hit in the neck and died at the scene.\"I'm just upset right now. My brother died in my arms,\" Lopez told the newspaper. He said Mr Archuleta had been \"full of life and energy\".Mr Lopez also said his 9-year-old daughter had been among those who were injured but survived, having been shot in the head during the assault.Patricia Flores identified herself as the aunt of Mr Archuleta. She was quoted by the BBC's US partner CBS saying: \"He was a good kid and he went to the celebration for a friend of his, it was his friend's daughter, I believe.\"",

    "body": "Venezuela has condemned US President Donald Trump's statement that the airspace around the country should be considered closed.The country's foreign ministry called Trump's comments \"another extravagant, illegal and unjustified aggression against the Venezuelan people\". The US does not have legal authority to close another country's airspace and the Venezuelan statement accused Trump of making a \"colonialist threat\". The US has built its military presence in the area and carried out at least 21 strikes on boats it said were carrying drugs, killing more than 80, without providing evidence. Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has said the US actions are attempt to oust him.Trump wrote on Truth Social: \"To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.\"The White House did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.Some Democratic and Republican members of the US Congress have expressed anger that Trump has not sought legislative approval.\"Trump's reckless actions towards Venezuela are pushing America closer and closer to another costly foreign war,\" top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer posted on X on Sunday.\"Under our constitution, Congress has the sole power to declare war.\"Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, until recently a close Trump ally, said: \"Reminder, Congress has the sole power to declare war.\"Trump's comments come just days after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned airlines of \"heightened military activity in and around Venezuela\", leading to several major airlines suspending flights there. Caracas then rescinded their take-off and landing rights.Venezuela's foreign ministry urged \"the international community, the sovereign governments of the world, the UN, and the relevant multilateral organisations to firmly reject this immoral act of aggression\", in a statement on Saturday. The same day, Venezuela's military conducted exercises along coastal areas, with state TV showing anti-aircraft weapons and other artillery being manoeuvred.The US has deployed the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, and about 15,000 troops to within striking distance of Venezuela.It has insisted that the deployment - the largest by the US in the region since it invaded Panama in 1989 - is to combat drug trafficking.Trump warned on Thursday that US efforts to halt Venezuelan drug trafficking \"by land\" would begin \"very soon\". The Venezuelan government believes the aim of the US is to depose the left-wing Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced by the Venezuelan opposition and many nations as rigged.Fellow left-wing President Gustavo Petro of Colombia - who has also faced US sanctions - has said he believed the US was using \"violence to dominate\" Latin America, though other leaders in the region have welcomed Trump's stance.The US has also designated Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns – a group it alleges is headed by Maduro – as a foreign terrorist organisation.Labelling an organisation as a terrorist group gives US law enforcement and military agencies broader powers to target and dismantle it.Venezuela's foreign ministry has \"categorically, firmly, and absolutely rejected\" the designation.",

    "body": "2 days agoJames Cook,Jerusalem,Paulin KolaandPatrick JacksonEPANetanyahu said a pardon would lead to national reconciliation in IsraelIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked the country's President, Isaac Herzog, for a pardon over corruption cases he has been battling.  The president's office said Herzog would receive opinions from justice officials before considering the request \"which carries with it significant implications\".  Netanyahu has been standing trial for the past five years on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three separate cases. He denies wrongdoing. He said in a video message that he would have preferred to see the process to the end but national interest \"demanded otherwise\". The Israeli opposition says he should admit guilt before seeking a pardon.Early this month, US President Donald Trump urged Herzog to \"fully pardon\" Netanyahu. At the time, Herzog made it clear that anyone seeking a pardon had to submit a formal request.On Sunday, his office released the request and a letter by Netanyahu himself, in light of \"the importance of this extraordinary request and its implications\".It offered no indication of when the president might reach a decision.In 2020, Benjamin Netanyahu became the first serving Israeli prime minister to stand trial:In the first case, prosecutors alleged that he had received gifts - mainly cigars and bottles of champagne - from powerful businessmen in exchange for favoursHe is accused in a second case of offering to help improve the circulation of an Israeli newspaper in exchange for positive coverageAnd in a third, prosecutors have alleged that he promoted regulatory decisions favourable to the controlling shareholder of an Israeli telecoms company in exchange for positive coverage by a news website.Netanyahu has pleaded not guilty to all the charges and branded the trial as a \"witch hunt\" by political opponents.In Sunday's defiant video message, he claimed that the cases against him were collapsing, but that the process was tearing Israel apart from within.\"I am certain, as are many others in the nation, that an immediate end to the trial would greatly help lower the flames and promote broad reconciliation - something our country desperately needs,\" the prime minister added.Netanyahu said he was being required to testify before court three times a week, describing that as \"an impossible demand.\"A pardon, he insisted, would help Israel fend off threats and seize opportunities by fostering \"national unity\".His political opponents have accused Netanyahu of attempting to conflate his interests with those of the state.Opposition leader Yair Lapid said there could be no pardon without an admission of guilt, an expression of remorse and Netanyahu's immediate retirement from political life.Yair Golan, a left-wing politician and former deputy commander of Israeli forces, said \"only the guilty\" sought pardon.According to Israel's Basic Law, the president \"has the power to pardon criminals and reduce or transmute [alter] their sentence\".However, Israel's High Court of Justice has previously ruled that the president can pardon an individual before they are convicted if it is in the public interest or if there are extreme personal circumstances.Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party and his supporters have always supported a  pardon for their leader.But for many in Israel - especially on the left - it would be seen as another move away from the country's sense of itself as a robust democracy with a strong legal system.Public concerns over the government's plans for judicial reform brought hundreds of thousands out on to the streets in protest for many months before the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023 which triggered the most recent Gaza war.In a separate case, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant last year for Netanyahu and former Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant over war crimes and crimes against humanity that have allegedly been committed during the war between Israel and Hamas. Netanyahu has condemned the move as \"antisemitic\".",

    "body": "1 hour agoFlora DruryandBBC IndonesianWatch: BBC reports from the site of deadly flooding in West SumatraThe death toll in the floods which struck Indonesia last week has now climbed to 631 on Tuesday, with rescue workers still battling to reach affected areas.The floods, which were caused by a rare cyclone that had formed over the Malacca Strait, have hit three provinces and impacted some 1.5 million people, according to the government's disaster agency.Nearly 500 people remain missing, while thousands more have been injured.Indonesia is just one part of Asia which has been hit with torrential rain and storms in recent days, with Thailand, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka all also reporting deaths.In Indonesia, the provinces of Aceh, North Sumatra and West Sumatra have been hardest hit, with thousands still cut off and without critical supplies.About one million people have been evacuated, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency said.Arini Amalia, a resident from Aceh's Pidie Jaya Regency, told the BBC the flood waters had been \"like a tsunami\".\"According to my grandmother, this is the worst, the worst in her life,\" Amalia said.Aid workers have been trying to reach people on foot and by motorcycle, as many roads are impassable to larger vehicles.Pictures from the region show bridges washed away, roads covered in mud and debris, and logs piled high.At West Sumatra's Twin Bridges landmark, where flood waters swept through and deposited enormous amounts of mud and debris, Mariana watched as excavators cleared the roads, hoping they would find her missing family members including her 15-year-old son.\"Watching the excavators, seeing how thick the mud is… I keep thinking, what condition will my child be in when they find him?\" she said. \"Will he still be intact? My mother, my brother-in-law… Looking at how it is here, maybe their faces won't even be recognisable any more.\"ReutersThe floods have impacted some 1.5 million people in IndonesiaMany are still waiting for food aid, with some saying they have not eaten for two to three days.Maysanti, who lives in Central Tapanuli which is one of the worst-hit areas in North Sumatra, told the BBC that aid workers were having trouble reaching her district.\"Everything is gone; our food supplies are running out. We can't eat,\" she said. \"Even instant noodles are being fought over now. Our food is gone; we need food and rice. Access to us is completely cut off.\"She said she has to walk kilometres away from her house to get an internet connection and basic necessities, like clean water.In Central Aceh where local authorities have provided Starlink devices, thousands were seen queuing outside the regency's office on Sunday night hoping to contact their loved ones or charge their mobile phones.\"It's been five days with no signal. We've been waiting since yesterday in case the network comes back. I'm planning to call my mother in Banda Aceh, but until now I still can't reach her,\" said one resident called Mar.As rescue efforts continue, anger has started to grow towards the government's disaster response.Critics say that authorities were ill-prepared for the floods. Some have blamed bureaucratic red tape for slowing down the distribution of food aid.Some activist groups have also claimed that environmental mismanagement, including the clearing of land for mining and agriculture, worsened the impact of the floods. On Monday, President Prabowo Subianto - who was visiting some of the flood affected areas in North Sumatra - acknowledged some roads were still cut off, but added \"we're doing everything we can to overcome difficulties\".\"We face this disaster with resilience and solidarity,\" he continued. \"Our nation is strong right now, able to overcome this.\"ReutersRescue workers and aid are still struggling to reach some areasAcross South and South East Asia, about 1,200 people have been killed in the last week in flooding and landslides. In Sri Lanka, at least 390 people died, while in Thailand the death toll has reached at least 176.However, there is no single weather event that has caused the floods. Instead, a combination of weather features have been to blame.According to BBC Weather, one element is the north-east monsoon, which affects East and South Asia from around November until March. As the name suggests, it brings north-easterly winds, which deliver a lot of rain to coastal areas exposed to this monsoon flow as moisture is picked up from the ocean and deposited over land.In Sri Lanka, the rainfall has been significantly enhanced by Cyclonic Storm Ditwah, which became very slow moving, delivering over half a metre of rain over a few days in some locations.That storm has now weakened and moved away northwards to bring rain in south-east India, with the forecast for Sri Lanka looking much drier over the coming days.In the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and southern Thailand, Cyclonic Storm Senyar had a similar effect, enhancing the monsoon and delivering more than a metre of rain in some places. This was a particularly rare storm, forming unusually close to the equator where cyclones do not normally develop.In Vietnam, the last few weeks have been exceptionally wet, with the monsoon rains having been enhanced by tropical cyclones. Now the remnants of ex-Typhoon Koto are drifting towards the Vietnamese coast, threatening more heavy downpours and further flooding.It is likely that climate change has also had a part to play. While global warming is not expected to lead to more tropical storms and cyclones, those that do occur have the potential to be more intense - with heavier rainfall leading to more flooding.",

    "body": "22 hours agoChris EwokorBBC Africa, AbujaGunmen have abducted at least 20 people, including a pastor and a new bride, in two separate attacks in the latest Nigerian kidnappings.Attackers stormed the newly established Cherubim and Seraphim Church on Sunday in the central Kogi state, firing shots and forcing congregants to flee in panic. They seized the pastor, his wife and several worshippers.In another raid the night before in the northern Sokoto state, a bride and her bridesmaids were among those kidnapped. A baby, the baby's mother and another woman were also taken, the AFP news agency reports.Schools and places of worship have increasingly been targeted in the latest wave of attacks in north and central Nigeria.It is not clear who is behind the kidnappings - most analysts believe they are carried out by criminal gangs seeking ransom payments, however a presidential spokesman has told the BBC they believe they are the work of jihadist groups. Kogi state government spokesman Kingsley Fanwo confirmed the attack in Ejiba to the BBC but was unable to confirm the numbers.He said authorities were working to track down the attackers.\"The security network, comprising the conventional security agencies and the local security architecture are currently doing what they should do,\" he told the BBC.In the attack in the mostly Muslim Sokoto state, local media reported that the bride had been preparing for a wedding ceremony the following morning and she was seized alongside her friends and other guests who had gone to support her.Some 250 schoolchildren and 12 teachers are still believed to be missing following the biggest such attack in recent weeks, while those seized in other raids have reportedly been released.The spate of abductions has renewed concerns about the vulnerability of rural communities. It adds to pressure on the authorities to bolster protection for those at risk -  schools, churches and isolated communities.Paying ransoms has been outlawed in a bid to stop the lucrative kidnapping industry, however it is widely believed that such payments are still being made.Nigeria's security crisis attracted the international spotlight last month after US President Donald Trump threatened to send over troops if the government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".Nigerian officials and analysts say that members of all faiths are victims of the violence and kidnappings and say it is not true that Christians are being targeted.Additional reporting by Basillioh Rukanga",

    "body": "41 minutes agoJames ChaterandLaura GozziRussian Presidential Press ServiceVladimir Putin was filmed visiting a command post at the weekend, in video released on the eve of Steve Witkoff's visit to MoscowRussian President Vladimir Putin will meet US special envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow on Tuesday, after the White House said it was \"very optimistic\" about reaching a deal to end the Ukraine war.US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has acted as an outside adviser in diplomatic talks, is also expected to attend.The summit comes after two days of negotiations in Florida between Ukrainian and US officials, including Witkoff and Kushner, aimed at refining a US-backed peace plan which had been viewed as favourable to Russia.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the talks as \"constructive\", but said there were \"some tough issues that still have to be worked through\".Witkoff's meeting with Putin will be during the second half of Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Speaking after a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Monday, Zelensky said Kyiv's priorities in peace talks were maintaining Ukraine's sovereignty and securing strong security guarantees.Zelensky said the \"territorial issue is the most difficult\" element of the peace deal, with the Kremlin continuing to push for Ukraine to cede territory in the east which it still controls - something Kyiv has long-maintained it will never do.The talks in Moscow on Tuesday come hours after Russian officials claimed to have captured the key strategic town of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine, known in Russian as Krasnoarmeysk, and the north-eastern Ukrainian border town of Vovchansk.Ukrainian officials made no acknowledgement that either city had fallen to Russia and open-source intelligence projects monitoring the front lines of the war suggested neither Vovchansk nor Pokrovsk had yet been fully captured by the Russian army. The head of Ukraine's centre for countering disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said it seemed Russia's main aim was to ensure all the pressure in the US peace plan was put on Ukraine.Russia has spent almost a year and a half trying to capture Pokrovsk and released a video showing Putin visiting a command post at the weekend in which he was quoted as saying Russia has made progress in \"an important area, we all understand just how important\".Ahead of his trip to Moscow, Witkoff also held talks with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Zelensky and Ukraine's new chief negotiator Rustem Umerov, while several key European leaders virtually joined the Zelensky-Macron meeting. Speaking on Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the draft peace deal had \"been very much refined\", adding: \"I think the administration feels very optimistic.\" She continued: \"But as for the details, I will let the negotiators negotiate. But we do feel quite good, and we're hopeful that this war can finally come to an end.\"Last week, Putin said he had seen a draft peace plan proposed by the US, and that it could become the \"basis\" for a future agreement to end the war.However, Kremlin officials later cast doubt over whether it would accept the proposal after Kyiv and European allies said they had secured changes to it.The initial US-Russia draft peace plan circulated in November sparked consternation in Kyiv and around Europe.As well as being heavily slanted towards Moscow's demands, it also dictated how several billion in frozen Russian assets currently held in European financial institutions should be invested, as well as setting the terms for Ukrainian market access in Europe.Speaking on Monday, Macron said there was currently \"no finalised peace plan to speak of\", and insisted that any such proposal could only be worked out with input from Ukraine and Europe.Macron said the question of territorial concessions could \"only be finalised by President Zelensky\", and pointed out that questions around frozen Russian assets, security guarantees, and Ukraine's accession to the EU needed to involve European nations.The French leader also praised efforts by the Trump administration to end the conflict, which began in 2014 with Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, followed by a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, said this week could be \"pivotal\", but that Moscow only wanted to negotiate \"with those who are just offering them something on top of what they already have\". She continued: \"I'm afraid all the pressure will be put on the weaker side because that is the easier way to stop this war when Ukraine surrenders, but this is not in anybody's interest.\"In recent months Moscow has at times appeared to engage with US attempts to mediate an agreement to end the war, but several of its demands directly counter Ukraine's sovereignty and are seen as unacceptable by Kyiv.While the question of territory is the major sticking point, the issue of security guarantees for Kyiv has also proved contentious.Kyiv and its European partners are keen for Ukraine to be given security guarantees - such as Nato membership - that would protect it from being attacked again.But Russia vehemently opposes this and Trump has also ruled out allowing Ukraine to join the military alliance.",

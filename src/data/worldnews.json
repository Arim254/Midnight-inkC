    "body": "45 minutes agoJerome Wirawan,in Indonesia, and Aleks PhillipsReutersMore than 50 people have been injured in explosions during Friday prayers at a mosque in Indonesia, with authorities identifying a 17-year-old student as the suspected perpetrator. The incident happened at around 12:15 local time (05:15 GMT) inside a school complex that housed the mosque in Kelapa Gading - a district in the capital, Jakarta. The victims, mostly pupils, sustained a range of injuries, including severe burns. The suspect was also hurt, according to Indonesia's police chief, Listyo Sigit Prabowo. He added that an investigation into the incident is under way, \"including how the suspect assembled and carried out the attack\". A bomb disposal team was deployed to the state-run high school complex following the explosions to collect evidence and ensure there were no other explosive devices.A pupil at the school alleged to Indonesia's government-owned news agency Antara that a homemade bomb had been brought in by a student who had often been bullied by other students.Other pupils told Indonesian news outlets that the suspect was a \"loner\" who often made drawings depicting violence, and who had been found lying on the ground following the explosion.A cook at the school described seeing white smoke coming from the mosque and broken windows after the \"massive\" blast.\"Our hearts were beating fast, we couldn't breathe,\" she told the Reuters news agency.A high-ranking Jakarta Metropolitan Police officer confirmed the presence of two objects resembling firearms at the scene.Images from Antara suggest one of the objects appeared to be a submachine gun and another looked like a pistol.The submachine gun-type object appears to be inscribed on its barrel with: \"14 words. For Agartha.\"On its body, it says: \"Brenton Tarrant. Welcome to Hell.\"Brenton Tarrant is the perpetrator of a 2019 mass shooting at a mosque and Islamic centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, that killed 51 and injured dozens of others.A minister who visited the scene later on Friday sought to dispel suggestions that weapons were present at the site, telling CNN Indonesia what had been pictured \"turned out to be a toy gun, not a real gun\".Lodewijk Freidrich Paulus also called on the public not to presume the explosion was a \"terrorist act\" as investigators were still combing over the scene.Another object found at the site was a dark green belt for storing gun cartridges.Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population.",

An investigation is currently ongoing.\"Initial tests by a Hazmat team did not detect anything hazardous, according to CNN.

    "body": "A British grandmother who spent 12 years on death row in Indonesia after being convicted of drug trafficking flew home on Friday, as part of a deal between the UK and Indonesian governments.Lindsay Sandiford, 69, was sentenced to death on the island of Bali in 2013, after she was found with nearly 5kg of cocaine worth £1.6m ($2.1m) when she arrived on a flight from Thailand in 2012.Indonesia has some of the world's most stringent drug laws, but it has freed several high-profile detainees, including the infamous \"Bali Nine\" drug ring, in the past year.Sandiford was repatriated along with another British national Shahab Shahabadi, who had been serving a life sentence for drug smuggling.Their flight left Bali at about 00:30 local time (16:30 GMT Thursday), Indonesian officials said. Sandiford and Shahabadi were both said to be suffering from health problems while in prison. Last month, Indonesia's senior law and human rights minister, Yusril Ihza Mahendra, said Sandiford was \"seriously ill\" while Shahabadi had \"various serious illnesses, including mental health issues\", AFP news agency reported.Sandiford attended a press conference in the Bali prison in a wheelchair hours before she was due to fly home.She had admitted to the offences in 2013, but said she only agreed to carry the cocaine after a drug syndicate threatened to kill her son.The UK's Deputy Ambassador to Indonesia Matthew Downing said Sandiford and Shahabadi were being repatriated on \"humanitarian grounds\". They will be given necessary treatment while being \"governed by the law and procedures of the UK\" upon their return, he added.In December 2024, Indonesia repatriated the five remaining members of the \"Bali Nine\" drug ring, after they served nearly 20 years in Indonesian prisons. The two ringleaders were executed by firing squad in 2015.Also in December, Filipina Mary Jane Veloso was repatriated to the Philippines. The mother of two, who was nearly executed, had always maintained she was tricked into carrying the drugs found on her.",

    "body": "8 hours agoLaura BickerChina correspondentChina's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, has entered service days after a grand commissioning ceremony overseen by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, state media said. The Fujian, the country's third aircraft carrier, is equipped with electromagnetic catapults which will allow planes to be launched at higher speeds.Its launch marked a significant step forward for Beijing, which now has the world's largest navy in terms of sheer number of ships.  China has been expanding its navy at breakneck speed under Xi, putting pressure on the United States and its allies to keep up.The Fujian can launch three different types of aircraft with its electromagnetic catapult and flat flight deck, according to state media. The domestically-built vessel can carry planes with heavier weapons and fuel loads so they can strike enemy targets from a greater distance, making it more powerful than China's first two carriers, the Liaoning and the Shandong - both built by the Russians.State media hailed the Fujian as a \"major milestone\" in the development of China's navy.The US is the only other country in the world to have an aircraft carrier with the same electromagnetic catapult system as Fujian.The Fujian's commissioning ceremony was held in southern Hainan province on Wednesday, during which Xi toured the ship's deck to hear more details about its performance at sea.State media claimed Xi had personally made the decision to adopt electromagnetic catapult technology. The reports also said Xi spoke to sailors who lined up along the flight deck and dock, saluting and shouting in unison: \"Follow the party's command, fight to win, and uphold fine conduct!\"",

    "body": "14 hours agoMimi Swaby and James ChaterPeru's Congress has voted to declare Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum as persona non grata - or unwelcome in the country.The decision comes days after Peru severed diplomatic ties with Mexico, after the Mexican government granted asylum to a former Peruvian prime minister facing charges for a 2022 coup attempt. Betssy Chávez denies allegations that she played a role in ousted Peruvian President Pedro Castillo's plan to dissolve congress. She has taken refuge in the Mexican embassy in Lima.Mexico says it has offered Chávez asylum in accordance with international law, and rejected Peru's accusation that it was an \"unfriendly act\". The declaration - passed in a 63-33 vote in the Peruvian Congress - marks the latest escalation in worsening ties between the two Latin American nations. During the vote, Peruvian legislators also accused the Mexican leader of having close ties to drug trafficking - a claim they gave no evidence for.Chávez had been imprisoned in June 2023 over her alleged role in Castillo's plan to dissolve Peru's legislative body. She was released by a judge on bail in September and has denied the charges against her.Prosecutors are seeking a 25-year sentence for Chávez.Peruvian Foreign Minister Hugo de Zela told the Reuters news agency that legal experts were reviewing the 1954 Caracas Convention on diplomatic asylum, which Mexico used to justify their offer of asylum.Earlier this week, de Zela said Mexico had tried to \"portray the authors of the coup attempt as victims\".\"In reality, Peruvians live and want to continue living in democracy, as recognised by all countries in the world, with the sole and lonely exception of Mexico,\" he added.Peru also accused Mexico of \"repeated instances in which the current and former presidents of that country have interfered in Peru's internal affairs\".In 2022, Lima expelled Mexico's ambassador following its decision to grant asylum to Castillo's wife and children following his arrest.Last September, the Foreign Relations Committee of Peru's Congress proposed declaring Sheinbaum a persona non grata for failing to condemn Castillo's attempted coup and advocating for his release.",

    "body": "14 hours agoNardine SaadLos AngelesShutterstockMeghan Markle and Prince Harry look on in the third inning between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Los Angeles Dodgers during Game 4 of the 2025 MLB World Series at Dodger Stadium. The Duke of Sussex has apologised to Canada for wearing a Los Angeles Dodgers hat while attending a World Series game against the Toronto Blue Jays.Prince Harry joked that he was \"under duress\" when he wore the bright blue cap during the epic Game 4 of the World Series in Los Angeles. He thought it was \"the polite thing to do\" after being invited to the game by the Dodgers' owner.His headgear choice upset many in Canada - a Commonwealth nation- who criticised him for not showing his allegiance to the realm, or to the only Canadian team in Major League Baseball. Prince Harry's father King Charles is the head of state of Canada and of 13 other Commonwealth realms. \"Firstly, I would like to apologise to Canada for wearing it,\" he said in a CTV interview. \"Secondly, I was under duress. There wasn't much choice.\"The prince - wearing a Blue Jays hat during the interview - quipped that \"when you're missing a lot of hair on top, and you're sitting under flood lights, you'll take any hat that's available\".He plans to wear a Blue Jays hat from now on and rooted for the Toronto team in subsequent games, appearing to do so in a clip posted on social media by the Duchess of Sussex - a Los Angeles native - when the Dodgers won the series in Game 7 a few days later.Prince Harry, who was given a Blue Jays hat while meeting with Canada's oldest veterans for a Remembrance event on Thursday, also said that admitting that he is a Toronto fan would likely make his  reception in California more difficult. Nathan Denette /The Canadian Press via APPrince Harry received a Toronto Blue Jays hat as he meets with some of Canada's oldest veterans, joining them in a creative arts program at Sunnybrook Hospital's veterans centre in Toronto on Thursday.The prince and his wife, a former actress who lived in Canada while filming her TV drama Suits, moved to California after stepping back as full-time royals in 2020.The couple's presence in the Chavez Ravine-set stadium in Los Angeles also disgruntled many Dodgers fans in the US. They took to social media to voice their upset over the couple's plum front-row seats during the 18-inning game, while local legends such as Magic Johnson and former pitcher Dodgers Sandy Koufax were seated behind them. Incidentally, Prince Harry published an essay this week about \"What it means to be British\" ahead of his visits with military veterans in Canada this week.In it, he said \"banter\" in pubs and sports grounds and a spirit of good-humoured \"self-deprecation\" are some of the things that he loves about Britain and what he thinks define British culture.",

    "body": "13 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton says he has sued Roblox over \"flagrantly ignoring\" safety laws and \"deceiving parents\" about the dangers the online video gaming platform poses to young people.In a social media post he said Roblox is a \"breeding ground for predators\", accusing Roblox of putting \"pixel paedophiles and corporate profit\" over the safety of Texas children.The lawsuit adds to the legal challenges related to online safety and internet predators faced by the gaming giant, which has tens of millions of daily active users.Roblox told the BBC it is \"disappointed\" that it is being sued based on \"misrepresentations and sensationalised claims\".The company's spokesperson said in a statement that it shares Paxton's commitment to keeping children safe online and that it has introduced measures to remove bad actors and protect its users.Roblox, which is especially popular with children, operates a massive online platform where users can play solo or with friends.The platform has been marketed to families and offers a host of educational games that teach subjects including coding, physics and problem-solving.Users are also offered developer tools to build their own games - a feature that has resulted in some violent and sexual content surfacing on Roblox.Another feature that allows users to enter servers and interact with strangers online has also been criticised for potentially exposing young players to dangerous individuals. Parents and children have raised concerns about Roblox, saying that they have seen distressing content or suffered abuse on the platform.Paxton called on the company to do more to protect children from \"sick and twisted freaks hiding behind a screen\".\"Any corporation that enables child abuse will face the full and unrelenting force of the law,\" he said in a statement on X.Texas joins the US states of Kentucky and Louisiana which have also sued Roblox over potential harms to children.Dave Baszucki, Roblox's chief executive, previously told the BBC that parents who are uncomfortable with their children playing games on the platform should not let them use it.\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" Mr Baszucki said.Roblox has introduced features in recent years to tighten age verification and safety for young players.The platform said it is rolling out technology to estimate a player's age using video selfies and other measures before they are allowed to communicate on Roblox.Last year, Roblox also announced it will block under-13s from messaging others on the platform unless a parent or guardian grants permission.Roblox has been banned in some countries, including Turkey over concerns about child exploitation.The platform came under scrutiny in Singapore in 2023 after the government said that a self-radicalised teenager had joined ISIS-themed servers on Roblox.The 16-year-old, who was one of two young people who were detained at the time, had joined Roblox servers that replicated real-life conflict zones such as those in Syria, the Singapore government said.",

    "body": "15 hours agoLana LamSydneyGetty ImagesMore airlines are banning the use and charging of power banks during flightsA man has caught fire at Melbourne international airport after a lithium power bank in his pocket ignited, leaving him with burns to his leg and fingers.The man, aged in his 50s, was in the Qantas business lounge on Thursday morning when the overheated power bank burst into flames, filling the exclusive area with smoke and prompting about 150 people to be evacuated.Staff quickly helped the man into a shower before paramedics arrived to treat his injuries. He was taken to hospital in a stable condition and later released.A witness said they saw \"battery acid flying everywhere,\" according to the Age newspaper. A Qantas spokesperson said the lounge was cleaned and re-opened two hours later.Australian film producer Leanne Tonkes was in the lounge on Thursday morning when she heard the commotion. She posted an image of the burnt power bank moments after it had exploded.\"Hoping the man who caught fire holding it is ok,\" she wrote on Instagram.\"Quick thinking from the man who jumped in to help and the staff who got him in the shower and everyone else out of the lounge.\"Qantas is currently reviewing its policy on passengers carrying any type of lithium batteries, including portable power banks, and is expected to provide an update shortly.Many airlines now advise passengers travelling with power banks to keep them within reach - either in their seat pocket or in a bag under the seat in front of them - and not in the overhead luggage compartment.In July, a fire broke out on a Virgin Australia flight from Sydney to Hobart, with a power bank in an overhead locker to blame. The airline is looking to update its policy and customers are asked to keep portable power banks \"in sight and within easy reach\" during flights.A portable power bank was also likely the cause of a fire that engulfed and destroyed a passenger plane in South Korea in January. Several international airlines such as Emirates, Cathay Pacific, China Airlines, Korean Air and Singapore Airlines have banned the use of power banks and the charging of them during flights.There are also limits on how many rechargeable batteries passengers can carry based on their capacity. For instance, some airlines only allow two power banks with a capacity between 100Wh and 160Wh. ",

    "body": "15 hours agoNick ThorpeBudapest correspondentReuters\"There is a war-opposing network in the world, with two focal points: one of power led by the US president and one of spirit found here with the Holy Father,\" Viktor Orban said last week after meeting Pope Leo at the Vatican.\"We draw strength, motivation, and blessing from both,\" said the Hungarian prime minister.If his ally in the White House, US President Donald Trump, was on his mind, then his thoughts could well have turned to a tricky meeting that awaits him on Friday in Washington.The man Trump has called a \"great leader\", and who has long provoked admiration in Maga circles, suddenly finds himself in an unusual position - at odds with the US president on an issue of critical importance.At the centre of those talks will be new US pressure on Hungary and Slovakia to wean themselves urgently off Russian oil - Trump's latest gambit in his efforts to pressurise Russia into ending its war on Ukraine.Asked recently whether Trump had gone too far in imposing sanctions on Russia's two biggest oil companies, Orban said \"from a Hungarian point of view, yes\".Orban has been using his country's heavy dependence on Russian oil and gas to advance his own agenda in several ways.He has used it as a weapon to attack Brussels, as a means to maintain his good relations with Moscow, and as a platform upon which he hopes to win re-election next April in Hungary. He has promised \"cheap Russian energy\" to voters.LISTEN: Nick Thorpe discusses Orban and Trump on Global Story podcastHe will go into this election portraying himself as a safe pair of hands in an increasingly uncertain world. But Orban is trailing in most opinion polls, after his government was shaken by the meteoric rise of opposition Tisza party leader Peter Magyar. The Hungarian PM has also been angered by repeated Ukrainian drone attacks on the Druzhba pipeline this summer, which briefly disrupted supplies to his country.Senior Hungarian officials have been hinting for months that they believe the war in Ukraine could be over by the end of the year - a seemingly absurd claim, until news of a planned summit in Budapest between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin broke last month.But Orban's carefully laid plans began to unravel on 21 October, when the White House announced that the summit  had been called off.Orban's government had been secretly working on the summit plans for months. Balazs Orban, Orban's political director (no relation), enjoys close relations with US Vice-President JD Vance, and is believed to have played an important role.The 'strongman' PM who inspired Trump's playbookOrban accused of using Ukraine spy row in fight for political survivalOrban hopes to persuade Trump to ease the pressure on Hungary at least until the election when the pair meet in Washington.The Hungarian government appears to be counting on the idea that Trump is bored by the war in Ukraine, and wants to turn his back on it if no deal is done soon.Orban has sharply opposed Western military and financial support for Ukraine, and rules out Ukraine's membership of Nato and the EU. He portrays Trump as a pro-peace president, giving short shrift to what he sees as the warmongers of the EU. The climax of the cancelled summit in Budapest would have been the moment he appeared on the balcony of the Carmelite Convent on Castle Hill, overlooking the Danube, flanked by Presidents Trump and Putin. How could Hungarians vote against such an internationally successful leader, he might have asked.In Rome last week, despite US dismissals, Orban insisted the summit would still happen - it was just a question of time. At the weekend, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov quietly suggested the same.Under US pressure, will Orban follow Czech lead?The biggest issue souring US-Hungary relations is oil.In 2024, Hungary even increased the amount of oil it receives through the Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline from Russia. On 23 October, just as Orban was addressing a rally of his supporters in front of Parliament in Budapest, the US announced sanctions on the two giant Russian oil companies, Lukoil and Rosneft.Hungary received 64% of its oil through the Friendship pipeline from Russia, via Belarus and Ukraine, in 2020. By 2024 that figure stood at 80%, or 5 million tonnes a year.The Hungarian government argues that land-based pipelines are the cheapest way to receive oil, and that with no sea coast of its own, it has no alternative. Much smaller quantities are also imported from Kazakhstan, Croatia, Iraq, and Azerbaijan.Another issue is that Russian Urals crude has a higher sulphur content than the Brent crude supplied from elsewhere. The major Hungarian refinery at Szazhalombatta, run by Hungarian oil giant MOL, and the Slovnaft refinery in Slovakia, also run by MOL, are both set up to process mostly Urals crude, not Brent.Within the EU, Orban is now the longest standing leader. Far from leaving the bloc, he wants to remake it in his own image, as a union of sovereign nations. For this, he has also won praise from Putin.But Hungary's argument that it cannot change is undermined by the Czech example. That is a country with a similar population to Hungary, and also landlocked.The Czech Republic traditionally relied heavily on Russian crude for the eight million tonnes of oil it needs a year.Starting in early 2022, following the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Czech government under Prime Minister Petr Fiala invested heavily in improving the existing Transalpine pipeline to the Italian port of Trieste.At the same time, its refineries at Kralupy and Litvínov were adapted for Brent crude. In April 2025, the Czech authorities announced proudly that they were no longer receiving a drop of Russian oil.Energy experts say that while MOL, the Hungarian oil giant, is quietly changing its technology, what is missing is a political decision from the government to shift to the Adria pipeline from the Croatian port of Omisalj. There are also disputes between the Croatian company Janaf and MOL - over just how much oil the pipeline could support.ReutersOrban has frequently found himself at odds with the EU, and has won praise from Russian President Vladimir PutinWhen the pair meet, Trump will urge Orban to show some political will to wean itself off Russian supplies. But Orban might see that as a hard decision to explain to Hungarian voters. After arguing for years that Hungary cannot survive without Russian oil and gas, he would lose face if it turns out it can.Matt Whitaker, US ambassador to Nato, said in a Fox News interview last week that Hungary had still \"not made any active steps\" to end its dependence on Russian oil. \"There's a lot of planning our friends in Hungary will have to do,\" he said, and promised US help to Hungary and Croatia to make it happen.As the seagull flies, Omisalj is only 44 miles (70km) from Trieste. Seaborne oil from Kazakhstan, Libya, Azerbaijan, the US and Iraq could soon be flowing through the Adria pipeline to Hungary too.Despite Orban's dire warnings of price hikes, there is no data - so far at least - to suggest that Czech consumers have to pay more.There is nothing his old friend Donald Trump likes more than striking a deal.Orban is about to find out how persuasive the US president can be.",

Miss Universe Thailand director Nawat Itsaragrisil criticised Miss Mexico, Fatima Bosch, for failing to post promotional content. He is widely reported to have called the 25-year-old a \"dumbhead\". But at a press conference he later claimed he was saying \"damaged\".When she stood up to object, Mr Nawat called security and threatened to disqualify those supporting her. Video of the tense exchange, which was live streamed on the Miss Universe Thailand Facebook page, has been shared widely online.

    "body": "6 hours agoLily Jamali,North America Technology correspondent, Liv McMahon,Technology reporter and Osmond Chia,Business reporterWatch: Tesla shareholders cheer Elon Musk's $1tn pay dealTesla boss Elon Musk has had a record-breaking pay package that could be worth nearly $1tn (£760bn) approved by shareholders.The unprecedented deal was approved by 75% of votes and drew huge applause from the audience at the firm's annual general meeting on Thursday.Musk, who is already the world's richest man, must drastically raise the electric car firm's market value over 10 years. If he does this and meets various targets, he will be rewarded with hundreds of millions of new shares.The scale of the potential payout has drawn criticism, but the Tesla board argued that Musk might leave the company if it was not approved - and that it could not afford to lose him.Following the announcement, Musk took to the stage in Austin, Texas and danced to chants of his name.\"What we're about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,\" he said.\"Other shareholder meetings are snoozefests but ours are bangers. Look at this. This is sick,\" he added.The milestones Musk must achieve over the next decade include:Delivering 20 million Tesla vehicles and one million robotsGetting 10 million subscriptions to Tesla's Full Self-Driving featureBringing one million self-driving Robotaxi vehicles into commercial operationEarning up to $400bn in core profitEventually lifting Tesla's overall market value to $8.5tn, currently $1.4tnHe won't receive a salary under the agreed deal.But meeting all the above milestones would see him awarded a stock grant of more than 400 million additional Tesla shares - worth around $1tn if the firm's market value is raised high enough.Musk's early remarks on Thursday placed the spotlight on the Optimus robot, dashing the hopes of some long-time analysts and Tesla watchers who want him to focus on reviving the company's electric vehicle business.Optimus, unveiled as a prototype by the company in 2022, is designed to be an \"autonomous humanoid robot\" performing \"unsafe, repetitive or boring tasks.\"Why human-shaped robots loom large in Musk's Tesla plansUsing the same artificial intelligence (AI) systems as those powering Tesla vehicles, it has been championed by Musk as central to his firm's future.He's previously said its ability to walk, run and lift items would allow it to play a key role in his factories - and in future, in homes.\"Let it sink in where Musk's head is at,\" wrote analyst Gene Munster, the managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, on X.\"His vision of the 'new book' starts with Optimus. No mention of cars, FSD and robotaxi yet.\"Later, Musk did refer to FSD, shorthand for full-self driving, saying the company was \"almost comfortable\" allowing drivers to \"text and drive essentially.\" US regulators are investigating Tesla's self-driving feature after multiple incidents, in which the cars drove through red lights or on the wrong side of the road, some resulting in crashes and injuries.Tesla shares were slightly higher in after hours trading but have risen more than 62% over the last six months.Sales have slid in the year since Musk aligned himself with US President Donald Trump - a relationship that disintegrated this past spring.Tesla shareholder Ross Gerber told BBC News that Musk's pay deal marks \"another notch in the unbelievable things that you see in business.\"Musk has made clear his goals for Tesla but the company faces a slew of challenges, including its struggling financial performance, said Mr Gerber, who is the chief executive of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki.ReutersElon Musk will get hundreds of millions of new shares if he hits his targetsIt is still not clear if there will be a big demand for humanoid robots, said Mr Gerber. Tesla also faces stiff competition in the robotaxi industry from rivals like Waymo, he added.Mr Gerber said that his company recently lowered its stake in Tesla due to concerns over \"the polarisation of [Musk's] persona\" which has \"demolished the value of the brand\".\"Elon seems to be divorced from the reality that his opinion among the public is so low,\" he said.Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives, a tech analyst who has been a long-time advocate of Musk's leadership of Tesla, called him \"Tesla's biggest asset\" in a note published after the vote.\"We continue to believe that the AI valuation is getting unlocked, and we believe the march to an AI driven valuation for TSLA over the next 6-9 months has now begun,\" Mr Ives added.Watch: Elon Musk dances in sync with Tesla robotsTesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon MuskAnn Lipton, a law professor at the University of Colorado, said it was unclear whether Musk would achieve the targets set out by the company, but highlighted how he \"hit those milestones ahead of schedule\" in 2018.She said his political interests had created some \"polarisation\", but his pay package did not \"put any constraints on his activities\" outside of the company.Musk already held 13% of Tesla shares. Shareholders had twice ratified a pay package worth tens of billions of dollars if he achieved a tenfold increase in the company's market value - which he did.But a Delaware judge rejected that pay deal on grounds that Tesla board members were too close to Musk.Tesla reincorporated from Delaware to Texas, and the Delaware Supreme Court is currently reviewing the lower court judge's decision.The new pay package was rejected by several major institutional investors including Norway's sovereign wealth fund - the world's largest national wealth fund - and the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) - the biggest public pension fund in the United States. That left Musk more reliant on Tesla's unusually large volume of retail investors.Musk and his brother Kimbal, who also serves on the Tesla board, were both allowed to vote going into Thursday's meeting.ReutersMusk said everyone would want an Optimus robotIn recent weeks, members of Tesla's board of directors have helped lobby for Musk's new pay package with a marketing blitz that riled some corporate governance experts.A video posted to votetesla.com showed board chair Robyn Denholm and director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson praising Musk.Kathryn Hannon, investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin, said the new pay deal would give Musk \"increasing voting power over the company\", which he had long been requesting for a number of years.\"Elon Musk, whether you like him or not, he is a visionary in this space and I guess putting the correct governance and incentivisation structures around him to deliver this does align him, hopefully, with shareholders on that success journey.\"",

    "body": "Small-town India to cricket World champions: The women who made history15 hours agoAnnesha GhoshSports WriterAlex Davidson-ICC/ICC via Getty ImagesAfter her father's death, Renuka Singh Thakur's mother worked to support her dreams Earlier this week, the Indian women's cricket team made history by winning its first World Cup title, nearly 50 years after the side played its first international match.The women fought hard for their win; after a three-match losing streak in the round-robin stage, they overcame external and internal challenges to defeat then un-beaten Australia in the semi-final and a resolute South African side in the final.The grit and determination they showed on the field are reflected in their lives off it.Many of the players come from India's small towns and have had humble beginnings. They come from families that had to sacrifice much to support their dreams and believed in them when no-one else did.These are women whose careers were built playing cricket in village lanes, with second-hand bats and seam-less balls and many doubting their ambition because of their gender. Theirs is a legacy that was forged because they kept going when it would have been easier to stop.Harmanpreet Kaur: Leading with what she came fromAfter the historic win was secured, captain Harmanpreet Kaur sprinted towards her father, Harmandar Singh Bhullar, the moment she saw him. She leapt onto him, wrapping her arms and legs around him as he held her. A captain - and a daughter- celebrated.Born on 8 March 1989 in Moga town - long known as the drug capital of the northern state of Punjab - Harmanpreet grew up in a family that kept its ambitions simple and its discipline firm. Her father, a club cricketer and clerk at the district court, sold milk from the family's four buffaloes to support the household. Cricket gear was often beyond reach. Her first coach Yadwinder Singh Sodhi once recalled how she trained with old bats and seam-less balls because that was what was available.Mr Bhullar ignored the neighbourhood refrain of \"ladki ko khilaake kya karoge?\" - what will you achieve by allowing your daughter to play cricket? He did not argue with the naysayers. He simply let his daughter - the eldest of three siblings - play.From those open grounds in Moga to the moment she lifted the World Cup trophy at Mumbai's DY Patil stadium, the values did not change for the Bhullars: work hard, stay grounded, keep going.PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty ImagesIndia's captain Harmanpreet Kaur (C) poses with family after winning the World CupAmanjot Kaur: Composed under pressurePace-bowling all rounder Amanjot Kaur's story begins in her father Bhupinder Singh's carpentry workshop in Punjab. When cricket gear was unaffordable, he made her first bat himself, carved from leftover wood.Neighbours questioned why he encouraged a girl to play. He continued working. She continued playing.In the World Cup final, her influence came in turning points. In the 10th over, with South Africa settling, she ran out the dangerous opening batter Tazmin Brits with a clean gather and throw. Later, with opposition captain Laura Wolvaardt past a hundred and the chase still alive, Kaur steadied herself under a swirling ball at deep midwicket. She juggled it twice and held on. The stadium erupted in cheers with that catch.The roots of that composure run deep. On her India debut in January 2023 in South Africa, she made an unbeaten 41 playing at number seven to lift India from 69 for 5. After that match, in a press conference - which I virtually attended with no other journalists present - she spoke quietly about her father's years of sacrifice. She did not embellish. She acknowledged what had made her cricket possible.Her catch in the final will be replayed. The hands that shaped her first bat are part of that moment too.Alex Davidson-ICC/ICC via Getty ImagesAmanjot Kaur's father, a carpenter, made her first bat himselfRadha Yadav: From pavement stall to podiumLeft-arm spin-bowling Radha Yadav's journey is measured in a few steps along one lane in Kandivali, a suburb in the western city of Mumbai. After earning her first BCCI contract at 19, six years ago, she bought her family a small grocery shop called the Radha Mini General Store. It stands only a few steps from the pavement stall where her father, Omprakash Yadav, sold milk and vegetables for years.The home above the shop measured about 225 sq ft (21 sq m). Space was limited; ambition was not. Her elder sister Sonee, who also played cricket, gave up the sport so that Radha could continue playing. The family backed one dream and stayed with it.She moved from tennis-ball cricket in narrow lanes to the highest stage of the sport because she was encouraged not to stop. The morning after India's World Cup win, a photograph went viral: Omprakash, smiling broadly, walking beside head coach Amol Muzumdar during the team's lap of honour at the stadium, the World Cup trophy held aloft, on his head.One frame held what the years had carried: street, store, family, belief.Annesha GhoshRadha Yadav's family, including her father Omprakash (first from right), outside the store she opened with her earningsRenuka Singh Thakur: Quiet controlFast bowler Renuka Singh Thakur lost her father Kehar Singh Thakur in 1999 when she was three years old. Her mother Sunita took up a government job to support the family. Her income was modest, but her support towards her daughter's dreams did not waver.Thakur first played cricket in the lanes of her village and later moved to the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association's residential academy in Dharamshala - one of the first residential facilities for women cricketers in the country. Distance from home and the demands of training were difficult. There were moments when continuing felt unsure. Coaches who worked with her reminded her of the sacrifices her mother had made to make playing cricket possible.That awareness kept her in the game.At this World Cup, she led India's new-ball attack, overcoming a prolonged injury-enforced layoff. In the final, she bowled eight overs for 28 runs. No release, no excess, no shift in discipline. A performance that shaped the match without seeking attention.A spell built on patience, restraint and memory.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "Typhoon which killed almost 200 in Philippines and Vietnam weakens11 hours agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent and Sen NguyenWatch: Typhoon Kalmaegi barrels through central VietnamTyphoon Kalmaegi has killed at least 188 people in the Philippines and five in Vietnam, according to the latest figures from the two countries.The storm is now headed west to Cambodia and Laos after it barrelled through central Vietnam on Thursday with winds of up to 149km/h (92mph).Towns along Vietnam's central coast were littered with debris this morning after taking the full brunt of the storm overnight. The strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows. Thousands of people sought shelter in schools and other public buildings as the army was deployed to help deal with the damage. Vietnamese authorities have warned of possible flooding in low-lying areas. Central Vietnam has already seen record rainfall in the past week which has killed 50 people.Earlier this week the same storm devastated parts of the Philippines when heavy rainfall sent torrents of mud down hillsides and into residential areas. Some poorer neighbourhoods were obliterated by the fast-moving flash floods. The death toll reported on Friday was a jump from the 114 reported the previous day. Another 135 people are listed as missing. The Philippines government has declared a state of calamity across the country as it prepares for another typhoon which is building up in the Pacific Ocean.Ahead of Typhoon Kalmaegi, Vietnam's military on Thursday deployed more than 260,000 soldiers and personnel for relief efforts, along with more than 6,700 vehicles and six aircraft. Some airports and expressways in the country were closed and hundreds of thousands were evacuated.Shortly after the typhoon made landfall at 19:29 local time (12:29 GMT), hundreds of residents in Dak Lak province called for help, local media reported.Dak Lak province is approximately 350km (215 miles) north-east of Ho Chi Minh City.Many people said their homes had collapsed or been flooded, while strong winds and heavy rain continued to batter the area.AFP via Getty ImagesTrees came down in high winds near Quy Nhon beach in Gia Lai, central Vietnam, as Kalmaegi approached on ThursdayAccording to local media reports, Prime Minister of Vietnam Pham Minh Chinh held an online meeting to direct the emergency response.\"We must reach isolated areas and ensure people have food, drinking water, and essential supplies,\" he was quoted as saying.\"No one should be left hungry or cold.\" Before making landfall in Vietnam, the typhoon, known locally as Tino, left a trail of devastation in the Philippines.At least 188 people were killed and tens of thousands were evacuated, particularly from central areas including the populous island and tourist hotspot of Cebu, where cars were swept through the streets. Kalmaegi dumped the equivalent of a month's worth of rain on the island in just 24 hours, sending torrents of mud and debris down mountainsides and into urban areas. Stunned survivors who had made it to higher ground watched as buses and shipping containers were tossed about in the raging floodwaters. The storm has wiped out entire neighbourhoods in poorer districts, where building materials are flimsier.In Talisay City, which suffered some of the worst destruction, Mely Saberon looked on in despair at the pile of debris that had once been her home.\"We don't have any home anymore,\" she told the BBC. \"We weren't able to salvage anything from our house. \"We didn't expect the surge of rain and wind. We've experienced many typhoons before, but this one was different.\"Residents have now started the backbreaking task of cleaning away the thick layer of mud, and picking through the wreckage for anything that can be used. Early on Thursday, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr declared a state of emergency, the threshold of which involves mass casualty, major damage to property, and disruption to means of livelihoods and the normal way of life for people in the affected areas.EPAPeople have been sheltering in evacuation centres after flooding destroyed homes in Cebu, Philippines this week",

    "body": "The safety of Kenyans caught up in post-election violence in neighbouring Tanzania must be guaranteed, Kenya's foreign minister has told his Tanzanian counterpart.Kenyan citizens are living in fear in Tanzania after being reportedly targeted in a brutal crackdown on the protests that followed last week's disputed election.President Samia Suluhu Hassan won the poll with 98% of the vote - and in her inauguration speech condemned the violence and blamed foreigners for stoking the unrest.Kenya's Foreign Affairs Minister Musalia Mudavadi said the rights of some Kenyans had been violated and that \"formal reports\" had been submitted to the Tanzanian authorities \"for appropriate action\".During a phone conversation, Mudavadi said he had told Tanzanian Foreign Minister Mahmoud Thabit Kombo that concerns would be \"addressed through the established diplomatic and consular channels\".But he had reaffirmed \"the importance of safeguarding the rights, safety, and dignity\" of Kenyans living in Tanzania.In May, Mudavadi had said that about 250,000 Kenyans lived, worked or did business in Tanzania.The Tanzanian government has come under intense international scrutiny for allegedly using excessive force to quell post-election protests, which reportedly left hundreds of people dead.It has sought to downplay the scale of the violence and has dismissed the number of deaths given by the opposition as greatly exaggerated.Earlier a Tanzanian police spokesman said the country had intelligence that some foreigners had crossed the border through illegal points \"with the intention to commit crimes, including causing unrest\".Several families in Kenya have expressed concern for the safety of their relatives in Tanzania, following reports that some Kenyans have been killed, injured, or detained, while others are nursing injuries allegedly inflicted by Tanzanian security officers.Kenyan human rights activist Hussein Khalid urged the government to take urgent measures to protect them, saying that Tanzanian authorities were using Kenyans as \"scapegoats for the atrocities committed by police against Tanzanians\".\"Kenyans in Tanzania are not safe. They are being targeted and harassed,\" Mr Khalid told Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper.John Ogutu, a Kenyan teacher working in Tanzania's main city of Dar es Salaam, was shot dead by police while on his way to buy food, his older sister told the BBC.But rights groups say his body can not be traced for repatriation and burial.On Tuesday, a doctor at Muhimbili Hospital in Dar es Salaam told the BBC that vehicles marked \"Municipal Burial Services\" had been collecting bodies of those believed to have died in the protests.Kenya's foreign affairs ministry has now asked relatives of Kenyans who may be in distress in Tanzania to share their names, addresses and emergency contacts.It acknowledged rising public concern over the government's perceived slow response in tracing Kenyans possibly affected by the Tanzanian unrest and said it was taking steps to ensure all nationals abroad were accounted for.Reports say many Kenyans, especially those working in private schools, are now fleeing Tanzania after the government warned employers not to engage people without work permits.Election observers say the polls fell short of democratic standards, but the government insists the election was fair and transparent.President Samia faced little opposition with key rival candidates either imprisoned or barred from running.Her inauguration ceremony was held at a military parade ground in the capital, Dodoma, instead of a stadium as in previous years. It was closed to the public but was shown live on state TV.She first came into office in 2021 as Tanzania's first female president following the death of President John Magufuli - and was initially praised for easing political repression, but the political space has since narrowed.Tanzania and Kenya, which are both part of the Economic African Community, have experienced periodic political and economic tensions.In May diplomatic relations were strained over Tanzania's treatment of Kenyans who had gone to Dar es Salaam to observe the treason trial of opposition leader Tundu Lissu.Several of them were deported while prominent Kenyan activist Boniface Mwangi, along with Ugandan activist Agather Atuhaire, went missing and were later reported to have been tortured and sexually mistreated.",

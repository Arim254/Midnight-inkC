    "body": "4 hours agoSebastian UsherMiddle East analystWidespread tributes have been shared for Bahram Beyzai, a giant of Iranian cinema and theatre, who has died aged 87 in the US.The front pages of Iranian newspapers mourn his loss, with opposition voices and those who look back fondly on the Shah era also paying homage to Beyzai.Prince Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the last Shah of Iran, described his passing as \"a great loss for the the art and culture of our country\".Although Beyzai's later films were banned in the 1980s by the Islamic regime that toppled the Shah, a number of senior figures in the current government have also paid tribute to his contribution to Iranian culture.Several of the current crop of Iranian filmmakers have acknowledged their debt to him, with Jaafar Panahi - whose latest film won the top prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival - saying that he taught them \"how to stand up to oblivion\".Beyzai avoided direct political references in his work, both as a playwright and a film director, and always said he tried not to trade in overt messages.But his work over many decades sets historical, even mythic figures in conflict with oppressive religious and political systems.From a family of celebrated poets, Beyzai was imbued in the deepest traditions of Persian culture from birth.He first found fame as a playwright, drawing on Persian legend and ritual.A lifelong fan of cinema, he moved into making films in the 1970s.He won renown as one of the key figures in the new wave of Iranian cinema.His most productive period straddled the era of the Shah and then the Islamic theocratic forces that deposed him - with both systems ever ready to sniff out hidden messages that could be interpreted as dissent.As Jaafar Panahi has put it in his tribute: \"Beyzai did not choose the easy way. He endured years of exclusion, imposed silence, and distance, but he did not give up his language and his beliefs.\"A few years after the Iranian Revolution, he produced what many regard as his masterpiece, Bashu, the Little Stranger, about a small boy who tries to take refuge from the Iran-Iraq war. It was banned in Iran - as were other films he made in that period - but later voted by film critics as the greatest Iranian film of all time.The film was shown in a restored version at this year's Venice Film Festival, winning an award for best film in the classics section.Beyzai finally left Iran in 2010, and spent his later years in the US where he taught Iranian culture.Although he left his homeland, his wife, the actress Mozhdeh Shamsai, said just hearing the word Iran would still bring tears to his eyes - and he remained ever hopeful of a new culture and future for his homeland.",

    "body": "3 hours agoThomas MackintoshGetty ImagesThe Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute issued alerts for strong winds across large parts of northern Sweden as Storm Johannes hitA third person has died in Sweden after a powerful winter storm swept across Nordic countries, causing travel disruption and power outages.Sweden's meteorological agency issued alerts for strong winds for large parts of the northern half of the country as Storm Johannes hit.One man in his 50s died after being struck by a tree at the Kungsberget ski resort in the country's south, local media and police reported. Further north, regional utility company Hemab said one of its employees died in an accident while out working.Police also said a man in his 60s was taken to hospital after being hit by a tree while working in a forest in Hofors, east-central Sweden, and later died of his injuries.Tens of thousands of homes in Sweden, Norway and Finland have been left without power as a result of the storm.In Sweden, more than 40,000 homes were affected by power outages and numerous rail services were cancelled, Swedish news agency TT reported.Several flights, rail and ferry services across parts of the Nordic nations have been cancelled. Roads and rail services have also been disrupted due to the storm conditions.In Norway's Nordland region, one of the most northerly counties in the country, the fire department responded to more than 200 weather‑related incidents, broadcaster NRK reported.Storm Johannes cut power to around 23,000 homes in Nordland and a further 9,000 were without electricity in the Inland region, according to NRK.In Finland, the storm - known there as Hannes - subsided on Sunday morning but had left more than 60,000 homes without power, according to public broadcaster Yle.Flights at Kittila airport in northern Finland were grounded after heavy winds pushed a passenger jet and a smaller plane off the runway and into a bank of snow, the Helsinki Times reported.The Swiss Air jet, carrying about 150 passengers, had just landed from Geneva and was taxiing when it veered off, the paper said. The smaller jet, a 400XT model, was on the ground at the same time and was also pushed off course by the wind, it added.There have been no reported injuries.",

    "body": "4 hours agoSebastian UsherMiddle East analystThe number of executions in Iran in 2025 is estimated to have more than doubled compared to the number that took place across the country in 2024. Norwegian-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) group told the BBC it had verified at least 1,500 executions up until the start of December, adding that many more have taken place since.Last year, IHR was able to verify 975 executions - although the exact number is never completely clear as Iranian authorities do not give official figures.However, the analysis shows another significant annual rise, and the figures chime with those provided by other monitoring groups.Iran's government has previously defended its use of the death penalty, saying it is limited to only \"the most severe crimes\".Execution figures were already on the rise before mass demonstrations broke out across the country in 2022 following the death in custody of Mahsa Amini.The 22-year-old Kurdish woman was detained by morality police in Tehran for allegedly wearing her hijab \"improperly\".That protest movement represented the biggest challenge to the legitimacy of Iran's theocratic leadership for many years.In response, authorities intensified the rate of executions from around 520 in 2022 to 832 the following year - according to the figures verified by IHR.There have been some executions for protesters or alleged spies - but 99% of those executed have been for murder or drug offences - a ratio which has remained constant.Activists have said that the rate of executions in Iran increases when the regime feels under threat and that the aim is to forestall internal opposition by instilling fear in the population.It seems to be borne out by the fact that since the 12-day war with Israel in June, as well as major setbacks for Iran's proxy forces across the region, there's been another big surge.",

    "body": "A cruise ship has run aground in Papua New Guinea (PNG) on its first trip since the death of an elderly passenger in late October. The Coral Adventurer is currently under investigation over the death of Suzanne Rees, 80, who died on a remote Australian island after being left behind by the ship. On Saturday, the vessel suffered a \"grounding incident\" off the eastern coast of PNG, around 30km (18 miles) from the city of Lae, a spokesperson for the ship said. All passengers and crew aboard the cruise ship have been reported safe, and initial inspections have not revealed any damage to the hull. Further inspections will take place on Sunday. A spokesperson for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) told the BBC in a statement that it had not received a distress call from the Coral Adventurer.It added it was monitoring the situation and would support PNG authorities if necessary. No decisions have been made about the current 12-day voyage, which was due to finish on 30 December.There were 80 passengers and 43 crew members aboard the ship at the time of the incident.The Coral Adventurer is currently the subject of a joint investigation by Amsa and Queensland Police, Ms Rees was found dead on Lizard Island on 26 October.She had been hiking on the island with fellow passengers, but broke off from the group for a rest. The ship left without her and returned several hours later after the crew realised the woman was missing.A major search operation found her body the following day.The ship was just two days into a 60-day voyage at the time of Ms Rees's death. The remainder of the cruise was cancelled with full refunds offered to all passengers.  The CEO of Coral Expeditions, Mark Fifield, said that the company was \"deeply sorry that this has occurred\" and had offered its full support to the Rees family.Mr Fifield added that the cruise operator was \"working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation\".Amsa was not able to comment on the status of the investigation, and told the BBC that it was \"not in the practice of making the results of its investigations public\".

    "body": "Italian police have arrested nine people accused of raising around €7m (£6m) for Hamas over more than two years.The money was ostensibly collected as humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians, a police statement said, but was instead sent to the militant group via a \"complex fundraising system\".Alongside the arrests, police say they have seized more than €8m (£7m) in assets as part of the investigation. Police say the suspects are \"specifically accused of carrying out financing operations believed to have contributed to terrorist activities\".The arrests were made as part of a joint initiative between Italy's counter-terror police and financial police.The investigation began after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack in southern Israel. Police say they analysed \"a series of reports of suspicious financial transactions\" involving some of the suspects in the lead up to the attack.Investigators uncovered a \"complex\" system of fundraising, which was headquartered in Genoa with branches in Milan, the statement adds.\"The suspects collected donations intended for the civilian population of Gaza, however, it emerged that over 71% of these funds were diverted to Hamas's coffers to finance its military wing and support the families of suicide bombers or those detained for terrorism,\" the police statement says.Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said the most well-known of the arrested suspects was Mohammad Hannoun, the president of the Palestinian Association in Italy.Piantedosi thanked police for their work in a post on X, but also noted that \"the presumption of innocence... must always be recognised at this stage\".Mr Hannoun said that he is \"neither closely nor remotely\" related to Hamas but has always supported them. \"I have always declared with utmost transparency that I am a Palestinian citizen and publicly support the legitimate resistance of the Palestinian people,\" he told reporters.",

The five identical sisters, born in Ontario at the height of the Great Depression in 1934, were the first known quintuplets to survive past infancy. They quickly became a global sensation during their childhood - starring in feature films, appearing on the covers of magazines, and endorsing products from toothpaste to syrup. \"Much beloved, Annette had championed children's rights,\" the museum said in a statement announcing her death.

    "body": "21 hours agoKwasi Gyamfi AsieduWatch: President Trump's name added to facade of Kennedy CenterThe head of the Kennedy Center in Washington DC has demanded $1m (£740,000) in damages from a musician who cancelled a concert after US President Donald Trump's name was added to the venue.Chuck Redd called off his Christmas Eve performance, which he has hosted annually since 2006, citing a vote by the board to rename the site the Trump Kennedy Center.The centre's president Richard Grenell wrote in a letter that the cancellation was a \"political stunt\" and \"has cost us considerably\". Redd did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Shortly after taking office, Trump fired several of the board members and replaced them with allies, who then voted to make Trump chairman of the board.Grenell wrote in his letter to Redd that his no-show was \"classic intolerance and very costly to a non-profit Arts institution\".He added: \"Your dismal ticket sales and lack of donor support, combined with your last-minute cancellation has cost us considerably. \"This is your official notice that we will seek $1m in damages from you for this political stunt.\"Last week, the White House announced the centre's board had voted unanimously to rename the cultural institution as The Donald J Trump and John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.A day later, crews could be seen etching the president's name onto the building's façade. Its website and some social media accounts were also renamed.The White House said the renaming effort was in recognition of Trump's actions to renovate the building, but the move was criticised by Democrats, several artists and members of the Kennedy family. \"When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,\" Redd, a drummer and vibraphone player, told the Associated Press news agency earlier this week.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesNew sign at the Kennedy CenterCongresswoman Joyce Beatty, a Democrat from Ohio, recently filed a lawsuit seeking to remove Trump's name from the centre.She argued in her lawsuit that, because the centre was named in a 1964 law, changing its name should require \"an act of Congress\".The lawsuit says Beatty had phoned into the meeting about the name change, but was muted when she tried to voice her opposition. She is one of several lawmakers designated as members of the board by US law. Work on a national performing arts centre began in the 1950s, and after Kennedy, the 35th president, was assassinated in 1963, Congress decided to turn it into a living memorial to him.",

    "body": "18 hours agoNick Eardley,Political correspondentandAlex KleidermanThe UK is to impose visa restrictions against people arriving from the Democratic Republic of Congo after its government failed to agree to measures allowing the return of illegal migrants and foreign national offenders. Ministers say the DRC has not made changes required under the toughening up of the UK's asylum rules announced in November.Fast-track visa processes will no longer apply to people from the country, while the Home Office said VIPs and politicians would no longer get preferential treatment when coming to the UK.Meanwhile, the Home Office said Angola and Namibia had agreed to step up efforts to take back their citizens, having been threatened with sanctions alongside the DRC.A government source said Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood would not hesitate to ban visas for other countries refusing to take citizens back.The Home Office said Angola and Namibia agreeing to improve their processes marked the \"first delivery success from last month's asylum reforms\".The government had warned it would stop granting visas to people from Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo if their governments did not rapidly improve co-operation on removals.A Home Office source said the agreements could see thousands of people removed and deported.Under the government's changes to the UK's asylum system, refugee status will become temporary, guaranteed housing support for asylum seekers will end and new capped \"safe and legal routes\" into the UK will be created.Announcing the changes last month, Mahmood had warned visa penalties would be applied to countries that failed to co-operate with the returns policies, including an \"emergency brake\" on visas for countries with high asylum claims until they take back citizens in the UK illegally.The Home Office had said that returns from the DRC, Angola and Namibia were being frustrated - with paperwork not being processed or people being required to sign their own documents - giving them an effective veto.It had warned that the three countries faced penalties for their \"unacceptably poor and obstructive returns processes\".It said there had been some engagement by the DRC but \"unless co-operation rapidly improves\" further measures could be imposed, including the possibility of a complete visa ban on people from the country coming to the UK.Home Secretary Mahmood said: \"We expect countries to play by the rules. If one of their citizens has no right to be here, they must take them back.\"I thank Angola and Namibia and welcome their co-operation. Now is the time for the Democratic Republic of Congo to do the right thing. Take your citizens back or lose the privilege of entering our country.\"",

    "body": "1 day agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondentandTabby WilsonA ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia has come into effect along the border, where almost three weeks of deadly clashes have forced nearly one million people from their homes.In a joint statement, the defence ministers of the two countries agreed to freeze the front lines where they are now, ban reinforcements and allow civilians living in border areas to return as soon as possible.The ceasefire took effect at noon local time (05:00 GMT) on Saturday. Once it has been in place for 72 hours, 18 Cambodian soldiers held by Thailand since July will be released, the statement said.The breakthrough came after days of talks between the two countries, with diplomatic encouragement from China and the US.The agreement prioritises getting the displaced back to their homes, and also includes an agreement to remove landmines.Thailand's Defence Minister Natthaphon Narkphanit described the ceasefire as a test for the \"other party's sincerity\".\"Should the ceasefire fail to materialise or be violated, Thailand retains its legitimate right to self-defence under international law,\" he told reporters.UN human rights chief Volker Türk said he hopes the ceasefire will \"pave the way\" for peace, while an EU spokesperson urged \"good faith\" in its implementation.Thailand had been reluctant to accept the ceasefire, saying the last one was not properly implemented. They also resented what they saw as Cambodia's efforts to internationalise the conflict.Unlike the last ceasefire in July, US President Donald Trump was conspicuously absent from this one, although the US State Department was involved.That ceasefire agreement collapsed earlier this month, when fresh clashes erupted. Both sides blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce.The Thai army said its troops had responded to Cambodian fire in Thailand's Si Sa Ket province, in which two Thai soldiers were injured.Cambodia's defence ministry said it was Thai forces that had attacked first, in Preah Vihear province, and insisted that Cambodia did not retaliate.Clashes have continued throughout December. On Friday, Thailand carried out more air strikes inside Cambodia.The Thai Air Force said it had hit a Cambodian \"fortified military position\" after civilians had left the area. Cambodia's defence ministry said the strikes were \"indiscriminate attacks\" against civilian houses.How well the ceasefire holds this time depends to a large extent on political will. Nationalist sentiment has been inflamed in both countries.Cambodia, in particular, has lost many soldiers and a lot of its military equipment. It has been driven back from positions it held on the border, and suffered extensive damage from the Thai air strikes, grievances which could make a lasting peace harder to achieve.Disagreement over the border dates back more than a century, but tension increased early this year after a group of Cambodian women sang patriotic songs in a disputed temple.A Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash in May, and two months later, in July, there were five days of intense fighting along the border, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead. Thousands more civilians were displaced.Following intervention by Malaysia and President Trump, a fragile ceasefire was negotiated between the two countries, and signed in late October.Trump dubbed the agreement the \"Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords\". It mandated both sides to withdraw their heavy weapons from the disputed region, and to establish an interim observer team to monitor it.However, the agreement was suspended by Thailand in November after Thai soldiers were injured by landmines, with Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul announcing that the security threat had \"not actually decreased\".",

    "body": "10 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykandAdam GoldsmithReutersUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet his US counterpart Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday, for the latest round of talks aimed at ending nearly four years of war with Russia. The pair will discuss an updated version of a US-brokered peace plan, which Moscow has yet to support, as well as separate proposals for US security guarantees.Their meeting at the US president's Mar-a-Lago home follows intense Russian bombardment of Kyiv over the weekend, which Zelensky said was evidence that Moscow \"doesn't want peace\". On Friday night, a 10-hour missile and drone barrage targeting Ukraine's capital killed two people and left 32 others injured, local authorities said.There were further Russian strikes on Saturday night.At the meeting in Florida, Zelensky is expected to raise security guarantees for Ukraine and territorial concessions, both issues that Russia has previously been unwilling to compromise on.They will also discuss the new 20-point peace plan, a revised version of an earlier 28-point plan drafted by US special envoy Steve Witkoff that was widely seen as being too favourable to Russia.Control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region has been a major sticking point so far, but Zelensky has now said a \"free economic zone\" could be an option. Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and around 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The regions are collectively known as the Donbas.The Kremlin has not commented on Zelensky's offer to withdraw troops from the Donbas if Russia pulls back too.But on Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Ukraine was \"in no hurry to resolve this conflict peacefully\", according to state-owned news agency Tass.Putin added that if Kyiv did not want to resolve the conflict peacefully, Russia would accomplish its objectives militarily.The Ukrainian president has voiced optimism about the new peace plan draft, describing it as \"a foundational document on ending the war\". On Friday, he told reporters that it was 90% complete: \"Our task is to make sure everything is 100% ready.\"But Trump warned in an interview with Politico that Zelensky \"doesn't have anything until I approve it\". Trump added that he was expecting to see the new draft on Sunday.\"I think it's going to go good with him. I think it's going to go good with Putin,\" he said in the interview, adding that he expects to speak to Russia's president \"soon\". Following meetings with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Zelensky said Moscow's latest attack on Kyiv was \"Russia's answer [to] our peace efforts and this really shows that Putin doesn't want peace\".Zelensky also took a call with European leaders to discuss diplomatic \"priorities\"  ahead of his meeting with Trump, adding that \"strong positions are needed\" to move forward with the plan.Kyiv has the \"full support\" of European and Nato leaders, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said. Gunfire and blasts heard on Friday night into Saturday morning in KyivRussia launched attacks on Ukraine over the weekend - the most destructive of which happened Friday night into Saturday morning. Ukrainian officials said Russia's attacks on Kyiv caused significant damage to energy infrastructure, with 40% of residential buildings in Kyiv and nearby districts left without heating. Russia's defence ministry said long-range precision weapons were used to target energy facilities, which it claimed were being used \"in the interests of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and enterprises of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex\".Russia directed almost 500 drones and 40 missiles towards Kyiv, targeting energy and civilian infrastructure, according to Ukrainian officials.Pictures showed gaping holes in apartment buildings and homes on fire following the strikes.The apartment block of BBC journalist Anastasiya Gribanova was struck, leaving some homes on the higher levels of the high-rise building in flames. Gribanova, who was in the building's lift at the time, was unharmed.The attack saw Poland, which shares a 530km-long (320 miles) border with western Ukraine, ready its fighter jets, ground-based air defence systems and radar reconnaissance.Later on Saturday morning, it concluded that there had been no violation of the country's airspace.Russia's defence ministry said its air defence systems had intercepted and destroyed almost 200 Ukrainian drones over several Russian regions, including eight over Moscow.A smaller number of missiles were fired at Ukraine on Saturday night into Sunday, Ukraine's General Staff of the Armed Forces said.It said the army had repelled 30 drones in the north, south and east of the country. No casualties were reported.",

    "body": "23 hours agoJaroslav LukivandMakuochi OkaforBBCOne strike hit a field near a village in Sokoto stateThe US has launched \"powerful and deadly\" strikes against militants linked to the Islamic State group (IS) in north-western Nigeria, where militants have sought to establish a foothold, President Donald Trump said. Trump told Politico he ordered the 25 December strikes as \"a Christmas present\" - contradicting a statement by Nigerian officials.Camps run by the group in Sokoto state were hit near the border with Niger, the US military said. Casualty numbers are unclear, but both US and Nigerian officials say militants were killed.Nigerian Foreign Minister Yusuf Maitama Tuggar told the BBC it was a \"joint operation\" and had \"nothing to do with a particular religion\".Tuggar said the strikes had been planned \"for quite some time\" using intelligence provided by Nigeria. He did not rule out further strikes. Referring to the timing of strikes - which took place late on Thursday - he said they did not have \"anything to do with Christmas\".But Trump told Politico otherwise in an interview. \"They were going to do it earlier,\" Trump said of the airstrikes. \"And I said, 'nope, let's give a Christmas present.'\"They didn't think that was coming, but we hit them hard. Every camp got decimated.\"The US military said an \"initial assessment\" suggested \"multiple\" fatalities in Sokoto state.A local official in the Tangaza area of Sokoto state, Isa Salihu Bashir, told the BBC the strikes had \"hit some Lakurawa terrorist camps\". He said many fighters had been killed but the death toll was unclear.The BBC has been unable to independently confirm casualty figures.Bashir added that border patrols on the Niger side reported seeing Lakurawa fighters fleeing the targeted areas.The Nigerian government has long been fighting an array of jihadist groups, including Boko Haram and IS-linked factions, but largely in the north-east. But in recent years a smaller group - known locally as Lakurawa - has sought to establish a base in north-western Sokoto state.Nigerian authorities say the group has links to jihadist networks in Mali and Niger. They add that its members have settled in border communities, recruited young people, and imposed harsh controls.Tangaza is made up of remote villages, whose residents are mostly moderate Muslims. In a statement late on Friday, Nigeria's information ministry said \"precision strike operations\" had been carried with the \"explicit approval\" of President Bola Tinubu and with \"the full involvement of the armed forces of Nigeria\".It also said that during the operation debris from munitions fell in two communities – the village of Jabo, also in Sokoto state, and Offa in Kwara state, about 600km (370 miles) to the south. No civilian casualties were reported in either location.Umar Jabo, an eyewitness in Jabo, told the BBC: \"Something that looked like a plane flashed and crashed... in fields.\" He said there was no issue with IS in the area: \"We live peacefully, and there is no conflict between us and Christians.\"The Trump administration has previously accused the Nigerian government of failing to protect Christians from jihadist attacks and has claimed a \"genocide\" is being perpetrated.Trump has labelled Nigeria a \"country of particular concern\", a designation used by the US state department that provides for sanctions against countries \"engaged in severe violations of religious freedom\".The US military was ordered to prepare to intervene in Nigeria in November.US Department of DefenseThe US defence department posted a short video that appears to show a missile being launched from a military vesselIn a social media post late on Christmas Day confirming the strikes, Trump said that he would \"not allow Radical Islamic Terrorism to prosper\".US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Thursday that he was \"grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation\". The Pentagon later posted a short video that appeared to show a missile being launched from a ship.Militants allied to IS have sought to establish a presence in two north-western states, while a separate IS-linked group has a stronghold in north-eastern BornoNigeria is Africa's most populous country, with about 220 million people, divided roughly evenly between Christians and Muslims.Jihadist groups such as Boko Haram and IS-linked offshoots have wrought havoc in north-eastern Nigeria for more than a decade, killing thousands of people.Most victims have been Muslims, according to Acled, a group that analyses political violence around the world.The strikes are the second major US intervention targeting IS in recent weeks.Last week, the US said it had carried out a \"massive strike\" against IS in Syria.US Central Command (Centcom) said fighter jets, attack helicopters and artillery had struck more than 70 targets. Aircraft from Jordan were also involved.Those strikes were launched in retaliation for the killing of three Americans - two soldiers and a civilian interpreter - in an ambush. ",

    "body": "One general, one mathematician: The men competing for power in two African elections2 days agoPaul MellyWest Africa analystAFP via Getty ImagesVoters in Guinea and the Central African Republic will get to vote for president On Sunday, citizens of Guinea and the Central African Republic (CAR) will go to the polls to elect their presidents for terms of office of seven years.Both contests could, in theory, go on to run-off ballots. Yet in both, the incumbents are strong favourites, with observers predicting they will clinch victory outright in the first round with more than 50% of the vote.But that's where the similarities end.The CAR, vast and landlocked, is one of Africa's poorest countries, marred by chronic instability for decades, with a succession of armed groups motivated by a variety of local grievances, opportunities for racketeering or political ambitions.From 2013 to 2016 it was only the intervention of African, French and then UN peacekeepers that averted a slide into deeper inter-communal violence.The national government in Bangui, the riverside capital on the southern border, just across the water from the Democratic Republic of Congo, has often struggled to assert its authority in the distant outer-lying regions of the north or far east.Despite these enduring fragilities, multi-party politics has mostly survived, with a fair degree of tolerance for opposition and protest.There is a sense of national identity and this year has seen two of the most significant rebel groups drawn back into the peace process and starting to disarm and demobilise.The country has a pioneering special court for trying human-rights crimes, staffed with a blend of national and international judges.AFP via Getty ImagesPresident Faustin-Archange Touadéra is hoping for a third term in officePresident Faustin-Archange Touadéra is a mathematician and former university vice-chancellor. He entered politics as prime minister under the putschist-turned elected head of state, François Bozizé. Later, after a chaotic interlude of rebel rule and an uncertain transition, he was elected head of state as a post-conflict and consensual civil-society figure.Today, approaching the end of his second term, Touadéra is seen as a far more political and partisan figure. He bulldozed through constitutional reform to scrap term limits, allowing him to stand again. This has provoked a boycott by much, though not all, of the opposition.Yet, contrary to widespread expectations, his most prominent electoral rival, Anicet-Georges Dologuélé, has been allowed to take part in the electoral race.This contrasts with the situation in Guinea, on Africa's west coast, where Gen Mamadi Doumbouya, leader of the September 2021 coup that deposed the 83-year old civilian President Alpha Condé, is now preparing to convert himself into a constitutionally elected ruler.Although Doumbouya will face eight challengers at the ballot box, he has dominated the campaign, with his image plastered all over the streets of Conakry, Guinea's capital city. The most prominent opposition figure of the past 10 years, Cellou Dalein Diallo, with a big personal following among the large Peul community who account for about 40% of the electorate, has been excluded from the contest.Despite these constraints on the political choice presented to voters, the return of an elected government will come as a great relief to the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), a regional bloc that promotes economic integration, democracy, and military cooperation among its members.Almost a year ago, it suffered a blow with the withdrawal of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger after the military regimes that had seized power in a wave of coups between 2020 and 2023 refused to comply with the bloc's demands to commit to clear timeframes for the restoration of civilian rule.AFP via Getty ImagesFrom 2021 (L) to today (R) - Mamadi Doumbouya now wants to be a civilian presidentDoumbouya made a different choice.Although he kept good relations with the junta in neighbouring Mali, he has pursued a methodical constitutional review, which has laid the ground for Sunday's vote, even if this has been delayed for longer than Ecowas originally wanted.His approach to international relations also contrasts starkly with neighbouring regimes, who have cultivated close security ties with Russia and repudiated their previous close partnerships with France.Doumbouya has maintained good relations with Western governments, particularly Paris. Officials in Conakry praise the French Development Agency as one of their most supportive partners.Indeed, from the outset, the Doumbouya regime has been treated rather gently by both France and the West generally, and by Ecowas, despite a troubling human rights record.His overthrow of Condé - who had staged a dubious constitutional referendum to allow himself the chance to stand for a third term and had overseen frequent bouts of security force brutality - was celebrated on the streets of Conakry and barely criticised abroad.AFP via Getty ImagesGen Mamadi Doumbouya has dominated the build-up to the electionDoumbouya earned international goodwill when he pressed quickly ahead with the long-delayed trial of those accused of a notorious 2009 stadium massacre when about 150 opposition supporters were killed and many women raped.And even though his own rule saw youth protesters shot, and leading civil society activists Billo Bah and Foniké Mengué detained and never heard from since, regional and international reactions were muted.West Africa has been shaken by coups and the breakaway of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger from Ecowas, as well as this month's attempted putsch in Benin. Guinea's decision to stay in the bloc and restore elected government - even if it breaches Doumbouya's earlier promise that no member of his junta would stand in the polls - has been greeted with quiet relief by many regional leaders and European governments, as a step towards reconsolidating normality.With jihadist groups now disrupting daily life and trade across the south of Mali and Burkina Faso, the gradual progress towards constitutional stability in Guinea, despite persistent civil-rights concerns, has been welcomed.The same goes for Touadéra's bid for a third term in the CAR, a country slowly emerging from years of insecurity. The UN peacekeeping force, Minusca, is helping the government to gradually restore basic administration and services, even to distant provincial towns.The CAR still significantly relies on Russian military advice, but the president has taken time to rebuild good relations with France and maintain a close partnership with the EU and the UN.With war-ravaged Sudan just over the north-eastern border, and deep fragilities still persistent at home, international partners are minded to support rather than criticise, despite the frustrations of those opponents who feel that a Touadéra third term would be illegitimate.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "3 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture correspondentBrigitte Bardot: From French cinema to international fameFrench actress Brigitte Bardot, who revolutionised 1950s French cinema and became a symbol of sexual liberation, has died aged 91.The cinema icon - \"BB\" as she was known in her home country - acted in almost 50 films, including And God Created Woman, but retired in 1973 to devote her life to animal welfare.French President Emmanuel Macron said the nation was mourning \"a legend of the century\", while the Brigitte Bardot Foundation remembered her as a \"world-renowned actress\".Later in life, Bardot's reputation was damaged after she made homophobic slurs and was fined multiple times for inciting racial hatred.Thomas Samson via Getty ImagesBrigitte Bardot - pictured here in 2006 - gave up acting to concentrate on animal welfare at the age of 39The Brigitte Bardot Foundation she established said in a statement that it was announcing her death with \"immense sadness\".The animal welfare organisation said she was \"a world-renowned actress and singer, who chose to abandon her prestigious career to dedicate her life and energy to animal welfare and her foundation.\" It did not specify where or when Bardot died.Paying tribute, Macron wrote: \"Her films, her voice, her dazzling glory, her initials, her sorrows, her generous passion for animals, her face that became Marianne, Brigitte Bardot embodied a life of freedom.\"French existence, universal brilliance. She touched us. We mourn a legend of the century.\"Meanwhile, French far-right politician Marine Le Pen said France had lost \"an exceptional woman, through her talent, her courage, her frankness, her beauty\".Bardot's husband, whom she married in 1992, was Bernard d'Ormale, a former adviser to the late far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen - the father of Marine.Herbert Dorfman/Corbis via Getty ImagesBardot tore up the rule book of French cinema in the 1950sBrigitte Anne-Marie Bardot was born in Paris in 1934 to a wealthy family, who wanted her to become a ballerina.She was discovered in her teens after posing on the cover of Elle magazine, swiftly becoming a sensation in her home country, and was persuaded to enter the cinema world.She played iconic roles, most notably in the 1956 film And God Created Woman, directed by her then-husband Roger Vadim, in which she played a sexually liberated woman. The film scandalised the American public and was banned in some US states, while the French existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir hailed her as an icon of \"absolute freedom\".Through the late 1950s and 1960s, she became a global phenomenon with roles in The Truth, earning critical acclaim for her dramatic depth; Contempt, a Jean-Luc Godard masterpiece; and Viva Maria!, showcasing her comedic flair alongside Jeanne Moreau.Beyond her most iconic roles, Bardot showcased her versatility in films like Love on a Pillow, where she portrayed a complex, emotionally-torn character, and Two Weeks in September, a romantic drama that highlighted her ability to convey vulnerability.In The Bear and the Doll, she brought playful charm to a comedic role, proving her range across genres. These films, though less celebrated, underscored her ability to captivate audiences in diverse narratives.As well as her work in film, Bardot will also be remembered as a fashion icon, with her blonde tousled hair and bold eyeliner setting beauty trends worldwide. After wearing an off-the-shoulder number in Cannes in 1953, similar styles became known as the Bardot neckline.She was married four times and had one son, Nicolas, with French actor and film producer Jacques Charrier, who died in September.Nicolas later sued his mother for emotional damage after she wrote in an autobiography that she would have preferred to \"give birth to a little dog\".Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone via Getty ImagesBardot, Jacques Charrier and their three-day-old son Nicolas in 1960Ruthlessly marketed as a hedonistic sex symbol, Bardot was frustrated in her ambition to become a serious actress.At the height of her fame, she announced she was retiring at the age of 39 to devote her life to animal welfare.\"I gave my youth and beauty to men, I give my wisdom and experience to animals,\" Bardot famously declared.In 1986, she launched the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, which works to protect wild and domestic animals.She became a vegetarian, and in 2013 even threatened to apply for Russian citizenship in protest against plans to kill two sick elephants in a French zoo.Reacting to her death, France's oldest animal protection association - The Société Protectrice des Animaux - paid tribute to an \"iconic and passionate figure for the animal cause\".Charly Hel/Prestige/Getty ImagesBardot, pictured here in 2001, became an increasingly controversial figure in her later lifeBut for all her cinema successes and animal welfare work, Bardot leaves behind a controversial legacy, with a string of remarks later in life about Islam, gay people and the #MeToo movement impacting her reputation.From the late 1990s, Bardot was fined multiple times for inciting racial hatred after comments she made online and in interviews about Muslims. She was fined €15,000 (£12,000) in 2008 after complaining on her website that Muslims were \"destroying our country by imposing their ways\".Bardot faced fierce criticism for her 2003 book, A Cry in the Silence, where she argued gay people, modern art, politicians and immigrants destroyed French culture. In 2018, Bardot also dismissed actresses who commented on sexual harassment via the #MeToo movement as \"hypocritical, ridiculous, uninteresting\".\"There are many actresses who flirt with producers in order to get a role,\" Bardot said in an interview with French magazine, Paris Match.",

    "body": "11 hours agoJake Horton,Ghoncheh HabibiazadandSarah JalaliBBCCrowds of mourners appear to have been fired on by a security official at a cemetery in Iran.The incident happened in Abdanan, in west Iran, on Tuesday as people gathered to commemorate those killed during the government's brutal crackdown on protesters last month.Iranians usually hold commemoration ceremonies on the 40th day after someone dies. The events have been held in several cities across the country to mourn the thousands killed during the deadliest nights of protests on 8 and 9 January.Verified video also shows people shouting anti-government chants at events in Tehran, Mashhad and Abdanan on Tuesday as crowds gathered at cemeteries and in the streets for commemorations.State-organised ceremonies were broadcast on TV and attended by senior government and military officials where people were led by organisers to chant \"death to America\".BBC Verify and BBC Persian have verified footage of people chanting \"death to Khamenei\", referencing Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. An armoured vehicle is then seen driving past the crowd of mourners as an apparent security official opens fire. People are heard screaming and seen fleeing the area as two gunshots ring out.The person who appears to be in uniform is seen pointing the gun away from the camera when the first shot is fired, before pointing the gun towards the crowd when a second shot can be heard. A puff of smoke near the gun is visible after each shot.Another verified video from the cemetery shows smoke in the distance as people run away from the scene and several gunshots can be heard.State-run IRIB News claimed that the event was peaceful and reports of people injured or killed were not true.XA billboard in the background of one the videos shows a picture of Alireza Seydi, a teenager from Abdanan who was understood to have been killed during the protests in Tehran last month and appears to be one of those commemorated during the ceremony.Weeks of anti-government protests started in late December which began over the economy but rapidly escalated. It peaked on 8 and 9 January after Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late shah, called for nationwide protests to take place. Thousands of people were killed in one of the deadliest government crackdowns in recent years. BBC Verify previously reported that it had spread to more than 68 towns and cities across the country.Khamenei last month acknowledged that thousands had been killed during the protests and blamed the US for the deaths.Additional reporting by Daniele Palumbo and Shayan Sardarizadeh",

    "body": "13 hours agoRobert GreenallGetty ImagesSpanish police have arrested a 20-year-old man suspected of hacking a hotel booking website and reserving luxury rooms priced at up to €1,000 ($1,180; £870) per night for just one euro cent.He was detained while staying at a Madrid hotel, where he was accused of racking up charges of more than €20,000 during several stays.Police said the alleged crime involved altering the payment validation system, and was the first of its kind to be detected.Their investigation began after suspicious activity was reported by a travel booking site. It took just four days to complete - the Spanish outlet ABC reported that the suspect used his real identity to make the reservations.According to police, the suspect is believed to have sabotaged the payment system via a cyber attack, getting the system to authorise his transaction after entering only one cent as the charged amount.Police said that the transaction had at first appeared to have been carried out correctly. The irregularity was only discovered when the payment platform transferred the actual amount - €0.01 - to the hotel company.Four days later, police located the suspect at the Madrid hotel and arrested him. His latest stay there was for four nights, normally costing €4,000. They said the man had also consumed mini-bar items during his stays and left other bills unpaid.The police statement appears to suggest that bookings had been made at other hotels, though no details were given.ABC reported that the suspect had previously been arrested in the Canary Islands, where he had also stayed at a luxury hotel.",

    "body": "20 hours agoYang TianGetty ImagesPeru's Congress has ousted interim President José Jerí just four months after he took office for failing to disclose meetings with Chinese businessmen.The scandal unfolded last month after videos emerged of Jerí meeting several times outside his official schedule with businessman Zhihua Yang, who was under government scrutiny.Jerí had previously apologised for the meetings, but denied any wrongdoing and accused his rivals of a public smear campaign.His removal from office makes him the third consecutive president to be ousted, after he replaced former leader Dina Boluarte, who was impeached in October last year.Jerí was Peru's seventh president since 2016 amid a tumultuous political landscape that has seen a succession of leaders leave the post under contentious circumstances.While lawmakers had set a date to discuss impeaching Jerí, in the end they opted for a different parliamentary procedure called censure, which only required a simple majority to pass rather than the super majority needed for an impeachment.Later on Wednesday, Congress will name a new interim president who will serve only for a few months - until a new president is chosen by the people in a general election this April. Jerí had come under fire following a series of controversies dubbed \"Chifa-gate\" - after a local name for Chinese-Peruvian fusion food and the restaurants which serve it.Security camera footage of Jerí's meetings with Yang, who owns several businesses and was granted a state concession for an energy project, was first reported by local media.In one of the videos, Jerí could be seen wearing a hooded top during a late-night visit at one of Yang's restaurants.Also present at one of the meetings was another Chinese citizen who was under house arrest while being investigated for alleged links to an illegal timber network.Peruvian law requires presidents to document all their official activities, but Jerí did not record those meetings.Jerí faced further criticism after it emerged that state contracts had been awarded  to a number of women following late-night meetings they had with him in the presidential palace.Ruth Luque, one of the lawmakers who backed the censure measure, said she wanted a leader who would put public interest and security first.\"We ask to end this agony so we can truly create the transition citizens are hoping for,\" she said, according to Reuters news agency. \"Not a transition with hidden interests, influence-peddling, secret meetings and hooded figures. We don't want that sort of transition.\"Pressure had been mounting for Jerí to resign in the wake of the scandals as he faced a corruption investigation launched by the attorney general and his approval ratings plummeted.His removal marks another chapter of instability for Peru, which is due to hold a general election in April, after which power will be transferred to a new president.Less than a week after Jerí assumed power, protests organised by young Peruvians demanding the political class to do more to combat crime and corruption left one dead and more than 100 people injured.Correction 18 February: An earlier version of this article said José Jerí had been impeached as Peru's president. This was later updated to say he had been ousted by Congress to better reflect the parliamentary procedure used to remove him from office.",

    "body": "Do not give away Diego Garcia, Trump tells UK in fresh attack on Chagos deal7 hours agoJaroslav LukivGettyThe US had previously supported the UK's decision to proceed with the Chagos deal\"Do not give away Diego Garcia,\" US President Donald Trump has said as he criticised the UK's plan to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and lease back an important military base.Trump said \"this land should not be taken away from the UK\" and if it did it would be \"a blight on our Great Ally\", in a post on social media. In response to Trump, the UK Foreign Office said the Chagos Islands deal was \"crucial to the security of the UK and our key allies, and to keeping the British people safe\".\"The agreement we have reached is the only way to guarantee the long-term future of this vital military base,\" it said in a statement.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously insisted the deal is necessary to protect the continued operation of the base, amid previous attempts from Mauritius to dispute the legality of British sovereignty over the islands.Diego Garcia is the largest island in the archipelago, and is used as a joint military base by the UK and US armed forces.Trump's latest comments come ahead of talks between the US and Mauritius planned for next week.Posting on the Truth Social platform on Wednesday, Trump wrote: \"I have been telling Prime Minister Keir Starmer, of the United Kingdom, that Leases are no good when it comes to Countries, and that he is making a big mistake by entering a 100 Year Lease...\"The US president stressed that Diego Garcia was \"strategically located in the Indian Ocean\".\"Prime Minister Starmer is losing control of this important Island by claims of entities never known of before,\" he said. \"We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the U.K., but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them.\"And referring to ongoing US-Iran talks on Tehran's controversial nuclear programme, Trump said: \"Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia... in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime.\"The Republican president has repeatedly threatened to use military action against Iran over its deadly crackdown on anti-government protests and its nuclear activities. The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something that Tehran has always denied.Asked by the BBC about Trump's latest comments, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"The post should be taken as the policy of the Trump administration, it's coming straight from the horse's mouth.\"When you see it on Truth Social you know it's directly from President Trump, that's the beauty of this president in his transparency and relaying this administration's policies.\"Watch: BBC asks White House about Trump U-turn on Chagos Islands dealIn a statement, it said it \"supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago\".Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said Trump's latest comments was \"an utter humiliation\" for Starmer.\"It's time Starmer finally saw sense, U-turned and scrapped this appalling deal altogether,\" she said.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Trump's latest change in position showed that the UK needed to pursue closer ties with Europe.\"Trump's endless flip-flopping on the Chagos Islands shows why Starmer's approach is doomed to fail,\" Davey wrote in a post on X.\"Britain can't rely on the US while Trump is in the White House. It's time to strengthen our ties with allies we can depend on, starting with our neighbours in Europe.\"In response to the US president's latest post, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage - an outspoken critic of the UK handover plan - praised Trump's criticism of London's handling of the issue.\"Keir Starmer risks alienating our most important ally by giving away the Chagos Islands, the worst deal in British history,\" he wrote on X. \"President Trump is right to say the Prime Minister is making a big mistake. Starmer must cancel this deal.\"Earlier this week, four Chagos islanders - who are opposing the handover deal - landed on the Chagos Islands' remote atoll as part of a protest against the deal.They refused to leave it, despite a threat of eviction by a British maritime patrol.The Chagos Islands – officially known as the British Indian Ocean Territory – are located about 5,799 miles (9,332km) south-east of the UK and about 1,250 miles north-east of Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean.The islands have been under British control since 1814 and were bought by the government for £3m, which led to the establishment of the islands as an overseas territory in 1965.But Mauritius has long argued that it was illegally forced to give the islands away as part of a deal to gain independence.In the late 1960s, Britain invited the US to build a military base on Diego Garcia, forcibly removing thousands of people from their homes in the process.Some of those Chagossians ended up in Mauritius and the Seychelles, but others settled in the UK, mostly in Crawley, West Sussex.",

    "body": "22 hours agoKelly NgGetty ImagesAustralia has barred a citizen linked to the Islamic State (IS) group from the country for up to two years.The person is among the group of 34 Australian women and children who tried to head home after being released from a Syrian camp earlier this week, only to be turned back by Syrian authorities for \"technical reasons\".The ban was issued \"on advice from security agencies\", Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said on Wednesday, adding that the other 33 people do not meet \"required legal thresholds\" to be banned.Canberra has refused to repatriate the group, believed to be made up of the wives, widows and children of IS fighters. There are 23 children among them.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stressed that these families will not receive government support to come back to the country.\"You make your bed, you lie in it,\" he told a press conference on Wednesday.\"These are people who chose to go overseas to align themselves with... a brutal, reactionary ideology that seeks to undermine and destroy our way of life.\"However legal experts have warned the government has an obligation to allow citizens the right of return, and, responding to reports the group had valid Australian passports, Albanese said his government would not \"breach Australian law\".This group in the al-Roj camp in northern Syria is among dozens of Australians who have been held in camps and prisons across the country since 2019, when IS was driven from its final foothold in Syria.Opposition politicians have raised security concerns about the possibility of these Australians' return. \"How can only one member of this group be deemed a risk and the rest somehow okay?\" Liberal Party Senator Jonno Duniam said on Tuesday, offering to help amend laws to bar more of the group.The al-Roj camp is home to more than 2,000 others from 40 different nationalities, mainly women and children. Among them is thought to be Shamima Begum, who was stripped of her British citizenship in 2019 on national security grounds.Speaking to ABC, the camp's director Hakmiyeh Ibrahim made an appeal to all countries that have citizens held in limbo there: \"Take your citizens, take these children and women\".The children especially are growing up surrounded by \"dangerous ideas and ideologies\" in the camp, she said. \"The more time passes, the more complicated the situation becomes.\"Several of these camps have made headlines as the women and children living in them are severely malnourished and lack access to basic resources.Several other foreign governments - including France, the Netherlands, and the UK - have also refused to repatriate most of their citizens still held in Syria.",

    "body": "6 hours agoBrandon DrenonWatch: Eight of the nine missing skiers located deceased, officials sayRescue teams combing through the backcountry of California's Lake Tahoe region say they have found the bodies of eight skiers who went missing in an avalanche on Tuesday.The search for a final missing skier continues but that person is presumed dead, Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said at a news conference on Wednesday.Officials said one of the deceased was the spouse of someone on one of the search-and-rescue teams, making continued rescue efforts \"challenging emotionally\". Fifteen skiers were reported missing on Tuesday after a \"football-field\" sized avalanche came barrelling down in the Castle Peak area around 11:30 local time (19:30 GMT). Six have been rescued.Watch: California hit by heavy snow as avalanche leaves skiers missing\"I want to offer my condolences to the family in this very trying time,\" Placer County Sheriff Wayne Woo said on Wednesday.The bodies of the eight dead skiers are still trapped in the snow and can't yet be recovered due to \"pretty horrific\" conditions, officials said.Since the avalanche, another 3ft (90cm) of snow has fallen on the area, Tahoe National Forest supervisor Chris Feutrier said.\"The hazard remains high,\" he said.Once the bodies are recovered, they will be transported to the Placer County morgue.Families of the deceased have been notified. Authorities have not yet released any of their names.Officials say the victims are seven women and two men.Sheriff Woo said the rescue operation was a joint effort involving two teams and roughly 50 crew members who had to traverse \"extreme weather conditions\" using specialised equipment.At 17:30 local time on Tuesday, search teams arrived to an area roughly two miles (3.2km) from where survivors were sheltering in make-shift tents, and had to ski in from there.Two of the six survivors had to be carried back and \"could not walk because of the injuries they sustained during the avalanche\", Sheriff Moon said. They were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.Among the survivors, one was a guide and five were clients of the Blackbird Mountain guided tour. The entire ski group consisted of a mix of 11 recreational skiers and four ski guides.The avalanche on Tuesday occurred as they were making their way back at the end of a three-day trip. California Governor Gavin Newsom's office said in a post on X that state authorities were \"co-ordinating an all-hands search-and-rescue effort\" with local emergency teams.Conditions on Wednesday remained dangerous, multiple officials said, with Woo describing the climate as \"treacherous\".\"Avoid the backcountry,\" he said. \"Please allow us to focus all of our resources on continuing to recover these bodies for the family and bring them home.\" The avalanche that trapped the skiers was rated as a D2.5 on a destructive potential scale of D1 to D5, according to the Sierra Avalanche Center, which would mean it was over half a mile in length and would have a deposit of around 6.5ft. The Boreal Mountain Ski Resort, which is near where the accident occurred, has reported over 30in of snowfall since Tuesday.The resort decided to close on Tuesday because of high winds and low visibility.The storm has also closed several highways, including Interstate 80 and Highway 50.",

Air Force One and other planes used by high level US officials, including First Lady Melania Trump, are being repainted gold, deep red and navy blue as they undergo scheduled repairs and maintenance, according to the US Air Force.The colours will also feature on a new luxury 747-8i Boeing plane donated to the presidential fleet by Qatar, an Air Force spokesperson told CBS.The white, blue and robin's egg blue associated with the presidential jet have been in use since the 1960s, when John F Kennedy was president.Trump has called for updates to the executive fleet since his first term. His successor, former President Joe Biden, cancelled a broad makeover Trump had initially planned.The new colours have already been spotted on model aircraft seen at the White House, where Trump is also making his aesthetic imprint, from the large-scale plans for a new ballroom to the more subtle installation of signs in a curling font in gold.The private plane Trump travelled on during his 2024 campaign, sometimes called \"Trump Force One\", used the same colour palette that will be given to the presidential fleet.While it is not clear how much the paint jobs will cost, the US Air Force, which operates the executive planes, said in a statement to the BBC that the new colour requirements were \"not expected to result in additional delays or costs to the program.\"It added that it was implementing the new colour scheme on the Boeing VC-25B (a variation of the Boeing 747) currently used to transport the president, as well as four C-32 jets often used as \"Air Force Two\" for the vice-president, and the jet donated by Qatar. Painting has been completed on of the C-32 aircraft.AFP via Getty ImagesAir Force One in its current coloursPreparations began last summer for the Pentagon to refit the Qatari jumbo jet that is expected to serve as Air Force One. The Boeing aircraft - valued at $400m (£300m) - was donated by Qatar as an \"unconditional\" gift, with any necessary retrofitting costs being borne by the US government.While any plane where the president is a passenger is called \"Air Force One\", the holder of the highest office in the country most often flies on a specialised jet that includes an office, a bedroom suite, two kitchen galleys that can prepare 100 meals, office space and a medical facility, according to Boeing.",

    "body": "12 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorAFPA feminist anti-immigration group said Quentin Deranque had been helping to protect its members in LyonTwo more people have been detained by French authorities investigating the killing of a far-right student activist by suspected radical left militants in Lyon, bringing the total in custody to 11.Quentin Deranque, 23, suffered a fatal brain injury when he was beaten and kicked during a demonstration last week on the sidelines of a conference held by Rima Hassan, a member of the European Parliament for hard-left party France Unbowed (LFI).The wave of arrests began on Wednesday, and included a parliamentary aide to LFI politician Raphaël Arnault.Arnault said his assistant, Jacques-Elie Favrot, had halted all his work in parliament and his contract was being terminated.Even before his arrest, Favrot's lawyer said he formally denied responsibility for the activist's death and was unable to continue his duties because of death threats.Although the radical left party leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon has sought to distance the party from Deranque's violent death, LFI has come under attack from rivals across the political spectrum, less than a month before France votes in key municipal elections.Government spokesperson Maud Bregeon has urged the party to suspend Raphaël Arnault from its parliamentary group because of the MP's links to Anti-Fascist Young Guard, which has been blamed for the violence a short distance from Sciences Po University in Lyon.The political climate is febrile ahead of the March votes - seen as the last test of public opinion before next year's presidential elections. Within the past month Sébastien Lecornu's minority government had to survive two no-confidence motions to push through this year's budget.LFI party co-ordinator Manuel Bompard announced on Wednesday that the party's Paris HQ was briefly evacuated because of a bomb threat, and went on to accuse a large cross-section of the political and media classes of making days of false and defamatory statements.\"I call for an end to this absolutely despicable exploitation of the tragedy that took place last Thursday evening in Lyon, for which France Unbowed bears absolutely no responsibility,\" he told reporters. \"This climate should worry everybody.\"AFPThe attack last Thursday took place a short distance from Sciences Po university in LyonVideos captured from the scene show three people lying on the ground coming under attack from a larger group, all of them wearing hoods.A feminist anti-immigration group called Némésis said Deranque had been outside the venue to protect its members. Némésis has blamed Young Guard for the attack - an allegation it denies. A minute's silence was held in the National Assembly on Tuesday for the young activist, and politicians lined up to criticise the radical-left leader and his colleagues.Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally said Mélenchon had \"moral and political responsibility\" for what had happened and even former LFI MP Alexis Corbière called on the party to take stock politically of what had happened.Sébastien Lecornu said that \"without undermining the presumption of innocence\" LFI had to \"clean up\" its statements, ideas and its ranks fast.Mélenchon hit back, saying he refused to take lessons from Lecornu.However, more moderate figures on the left such as Socialist ex-President François Hollande have accused LFI of being responsible for lowering the tone of politics in France.\"It's clear there can be no alliance in the municipal elections between the Socialists or reformist left-wing parties and LFI in the second round,\" Hollande said on Wednesday. \"The relationship is over.\"For months the party had indulged in a kind of \"brutalisation\" of debate so there was no political space between the far left and far right, said Hollande.The actions of police have also come in for criticism, as local forces were warned that Rima Hassan's event was due to take place but riot police were not on the scene at the time of the fatal attack.The death of Deranque has prompted reaction across the border in Italy, where Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has described the attack as deeply shocking and \"a wound for the whole of Europe\".",

BBC Verify has confirmed the location of aircraft carrier the USS Abraham Lincoln - equipped with guided missile destroyers and dozens of fighter jets - near Iran.The US has also reportedly sent the USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, to the Middle East, expected to arrive in the region within the next three weeks.Senior national security officials told the BBC's US partner CBS News that Trump said the US military would be ready for potential strikes on Iran as soon as  Saturday, though Trump has not yet made a final decision.In Syria, US troops had already departed two bases earlier this year, the al-Tanf garrison in southern Syria and the al-Shaddadi base in the north-east.The movements follow the collapse of the Assad government in 2024, and a weakened Islamic State amid considerable security improvement in Syria.Since then, the Trump administration has sought to strengthen its diplomatic ties with Damascus and increase its partnership with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa.Sharaa visited Trump in the White House in November, the first such visit from a Syrian leader in the country's history.His government has at times clashed with local military groups, but struck a deal in January that would integrate the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces with Syria's armed forces.Secretary of State Marco Rubio met his Syrian counterpart, Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani, last week to discuss maintaining the ceasefire. Rubio also expressed concerns about the continued fight against terrorism.In December, a translator and two members of the Iowa National Guard were killed in an ambush attack by a lone IS gunman in Palmyra, Syria, the Pentagon said. The Trump administration retaliated with a series of raids against IS, called Operation Hawkeye Strike.The BBC's Bernd Debusmann contributed to this report.",

    "body": "3 hours agoAna FaguyGetty ImagesUS billionaire Les Wexner, who is alleged to have played a key role in helping Jeffrey Epstein build his wealth, has described himself as \"naive, foolish and gullible\" for trusting the late sex offender.In a statement to US lawmakers, the former CEO of Victoria's Secret lingerie brand accused Epstein of stealing \"vast sums\" of money from his family when working as his financial adviser.Wexner, who was testifying before a House committee as part of its probe into the Epstein case, has denied any wrongdoing.  He was described as a potential co-conspirator of Epstein's in a 2019 FBI document, but no charges were ever brought against him.Lawmakers accused the billionaire of knowing about the crimes of Epstein but failing to stop them.Wexner was called before the House of Representatives Oversight Committee on Wednesday to answer questions surrounding his relationship with Epstein in the wake of the release of thousands of documents related to the financier's wrongdoing.Members of the committee travelled to Wexner's home state of Ohio for the testimony. A spokesperson for the 88-year-old tycoon told the BBC: \"Mr Wexner honestly answered every question put to him today by the Committee. \"Mr Wexner reiterated that he has no knowledge of, and did not participate in, Epstein's illegal conduct. He stands by that fervently.\"Only Democratic lawmakers attended the deposition. No Republican lawmakers travelled for it, though some of their staff members did attend.\"We should be very clear that there would be no Epstein island, there'd be no Epstein plane, there'd be no money to traffic women and girls,\" congressman Robert Garcia, of California, said. \"Mr Epstein would not be the wealthy man he was without the support of Les Wexner.\"Watch: Watch: Democrats say Les Wexner provided \"financial support\" to Epstein following depositionWexner, in his opening statement, defended those mentions by saying his relationship with Epstein was limited, and denied any knowledge of the convicted sex offender's abuse.\"I was naive, foolish and gullible to put any trust in Jeffrey Epstein,\" he said. \"He was a conman. And while I was conned, I have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide.\"He said he was \"pleased to testify\" and wanted \"to set the record straight\". Wexner also said he had visited Epstein's private island for \"a few hours\" with his family.The pair's relationship dates back to the 1980s and Wexner has said he cut ties after Epstein was accused of sexually abusing children in Florida.Wexner said he later discovered Epstein \"had misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family\", a statement he repeated in his opening remarks.The retail magnate was identified in a 2019 FBI document as a potential co-conspirator. A separate email also said there was \"limited evidence regarding his involvement\".Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche previously said Wexner's name \"appears in the files thousands of times\".Wexner's lawyers recently told the BBC: \"The Assistant US Attorney told Mr Wexner's legal counsel in 2019 that Mr Wexner was being viewed as source of information about Epstein and was not a target in any respect.\"Mr Wexner co-operated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again.\"",

    "body": "18 hours agoCherylann MollanMumbaiGetty ImagesOnline users identified the machine as the Go2 model made by Chinese firm Unitree RoboticsAn Indian university has courted controversy at the AI summit in Delhi after an official claimed that a Chinese-made robotic dog was its own invention.The incident came to light after a professor from Galgotias University told state-run broadcaster DD News that the robot named \"Orion\" was \"developed\" at their Centre of Excellence. A video of her remarks went viral. Online users later identified the machine as the Go2 model made by Chinese firm Unitree Robotics, which is commercially available starting at about 200,000 rupees ($2,200; £1,600).In a statement on Wednesday, the university denied claiming it had built the robot and described the backlash as a \"propaganda campaign\".\"We would like to clearly state that the robotic programming is part of our endeavour to make students learn AI programming and develop and deploy real world skills using globally available tools and resources, given developing AI talent is need of the hour,\" the university said.Neha Singh, the professor seen in the video, later told reporters her remarks had been misunderstood. \"It might be that I could not convey well what I wanted to say, or you could not understand well what I wanted to say,\" she said.Social media users, however, accused the university of dishonesty. Reports said that following the backlash, the university was asked to vacate its stall at the summit. Faculty members said they had received no official communication to do so.But hours later, news agency Press Trust of India reported that electricity supply to the stall was cut off following the controversy.A BBC reporter at the summit said the lights were turned off at the booth and no staff from the university were around.The incident is being seen as an embarrassment for the organisers of the summit as the video had also been shared on IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw's official X account. The post has since been deleted.India's IT Secretary S Krishnan said the controversy should not \"overshadow\" the work put in by other participants at the summit.\"What happened should not affect the way people present or exhibit their work at such events. The idea is not to use an opportunity like this to become something else or create unnecessary noise.\"It is essential that a proper code of conduct is followed. There are other countries and other participants involved as well,\" he told reporters.The India AI Impact Summit, inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Bharat Mandapam on Monday, is being pitched by the government as a flagship gathering to position India as a global AI hub. Delegates from more than 100 countries, including several heads of governments, are attending, alongside industry leaders such as Sundar Pichai of Google.The five-day summit features policy discussions, startup showcases and closed-door meetings on AI governance, infrastructure and innovation. However, its opening day was overshadowed by complaints of overcrowding, long queues and confusion at the venue, prompting organisers to extend exhibition hours and tighten entry management. They say arrangements have since improved.BBC correspondent Vikas Pandey, who is at the summit, said the venue was \"absolutely buzzing\" on the third day, with thousands of people from different parts of India visiting stalls and soaking up the excitement. Officials say they hope the event and the conversations around it will help adoption of AI across the country.",

    "body": "1 day agoJoel GuintoGetty ImagesSara Duterte has feuded spectacularly with President Bongbong MarcosPhilippine Vice-President Sara Duterte has declared her candidacy for president in the 2028 elections.The 47-year-old's announcement comes as she is embroiled in a bitter power struggle with current President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr.While the presidential vote is two years away, contenders in the Philippines' largely personality-based elections are known to prepare for years in advance.Marcos is ineligible for re-election and his allies have yet to field a challenger to Duterte - who is also the daughter of his predecessor, former president Rodrigo Duterte.\"I offer my life, my strength, and my future in the service of our nation,\" the vice-president said.\"I am Sara Duterte. I will run for president of the Philippines.\"Marcos and Duterte ran under the same ticket in the 2022 election, which they won by a landslide. But the alliance soon unravelled as they pursued separate political interests.Two months later, a mid-term legislative vote, seen as a barometer of support for the incumbent government, delivered a victory for candidates endorsed by the Duterte family, against those handpicked by Marcos.Just over a week ago, members of the Catholic clergy filed an impeachment complaint against the vice-president over alleged corruption, which she denies.Who is Sara Duterte?Sara is Rodrigo Duterte's eldest daughter and is widely-considered as his political heir.The elder Duterte once described his daughter as the \"alpha\" in their family, the one whom everyone follows.Sara served as vice-mayor to her father when he led Davao city in the 2010s. It was in that southern metropolis that the Duterte's built their reputation for being tough on crime, which they have described as necessary to keep people safe and encourage businesses to grow.Sara was thrust into the national spotlight when, in defence of shanty town dwellers, she punched a Davao sheriff in full view of TV news cameras.She was Davao city mayor when her father was president from 2016 and 2022, and her alliance with Marcos in the 2022 elections was pivotal for both their election victories.The vice-president, like her father, projects a tough image. She rides large motorcycles and has given her children nicknames like Sharky, Stonefish and Stingray. She also shares matching tattoos with her two brothers.",

Oh my God.\"Sides, who has been dancing for 60 years and teaches ballroom dancing classes, said she had signed up for TV extra work with an agency, and responded to a call-out for senior dancers on behalf of an \"unknown artist\". After being shortlisted, Sides received a call confirming she had been specifically chosen by the artist out of hundreds of applications.But she had no idea record-breaking Swift was behind the request.Sides said the whole experience was \"hush-hush\" and all she had been told was that the job involved recreating a dance competition.It was only ten minutes before filming began that she found out the video was for a track from Swift's latest album, The Life of a Showgirl.Sides, a Swiftie herself, said she was in shock when the singer walked in.\"I still feel excited now [remembering it],\" she said.Sides said Swift, who sang in and directed the video, put everyone at ease during filming and thanked dancers for their time. \"She knew exactly what she wanted.

    "body": "7 hours agoLaura GozziReutersRussian, American and Ukrainian representatives met in Geneva on Tuesday and WednesdayTalks between Russia, Ukraine and the US aimed at ending Moscow's war in Ukraine have concluded without a breakthrough. The trilateral meetings, held in Geneva, went on late on Tuesday but only lasted two hours on Wednesday. Although US envoy Steve Witkoff had expressed optimism over the talks, both the chief Russian negotiator and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky indicated they had been \"difficult\".After the main talks concluded, Kremlin negotiator Vladimir Medinsky returned to the venue and held a closed-door meeting with the Ukrainian side for about an hour and a half. No details from that meeting have emerged.Some progress was made on \"military issues\", including the location of the front line and ceasefire monitoring, according to a Ukrainian diplomatic source.White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said later on Wednesday that \"there was meaningful progress\" made on both sides, and an agreement to \"continue to work towards a peace deal together\".But an agreement on the issue of territory - without which no ceasefire can be envisaged - remains elusive, with Moscow and Kyiv's positions still far apart.Russia has not budged in its demand for full control of the eastern Donbas region - made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions - which is a non-starter for Ukraine.While conceding talks were challenging, Kremlin negotiator Vladimir Medinsky added that they had been \"businesslike\" and said another meeting would take place \"soon\".Zelensky also described the negotiations as \"not easy\" due to the difference in the two sides' positions. Rustem Umerov cut a less downbeat tone, saying the discussions had been \"substantive and intensive\" and that while there had been progress, no details could be disclosed \"at this stage\".\"This is complex work that requires alignment among all parties and sufficient time,\" Umerov said.Shortly before the end of the talks was announced, Zelensky accused Russia of \"trying to drag out negotiations that could already have reached the final stage\".The Russian and Ukrainian delegations last met in US-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi earlier in February, which led to the first prisoner exchange in several months. On Wednesday, Zelensky indicated that another swap might be forthcoming. US President Donald Trump, who spearheaded diplomatic efforts to end the war, has been signalling impatience with the deadlock between the two sides. On Monday, he said Ukraine had \"better come to the table, fast\" - a sentiment Zelensky has since rejected, saying it was \"not fair\" that his country should be the one asked to compromise.Four years on from the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, substantial distance still exists between Moscow's demands and what Kyiv might consider a \"just peace\".Kyiv has long rejected Russia's demand for the eastern Donbas, which would mean relinquishing Ukrainian sovereign territory, including several heavily fortified cities and a long defensive line in the region of Donetsk. Many Ukrainians believe giving that territory up would leave the country vulnerable to another Russian invasion. Zelensky himself has drawn parallels with the 1938 Munich Agreement, when European powers let Hitler annex the Czech territory of Sudetenland.On Tuesday, Zelensky told US media outlet Axios that any plan to hand over the Donbas would be rejected by Ukrainians if it were put to a referendum. The Ukrainian president is also working to ensure that robust security guarantees to deter Russia from attacking again are provided by Kyiv's western allies.Another sticking point in the talks is the status of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.The power plant – Europe's largest – sits on the front line and has been under Russian control since March 2022. Ukraine wants Moscow to return it and Zelensky has previously said Kyiv could share control of the plant with the Americans - an arrangement Moscow is unlikely to agree to.Officials from Britain, France, Germany and Italy were present in Geneva and held talks with the Ukrainians on the sidelines of the trilateral meeting. European representatives have struggled to be included in the US-led negotiations, but Zelensky said European participation was \"indespensable\" for any final agreement.In a wide-ranging interview on Piers Morgan Uncensored on Wednesday, Zelensky confirmed there would be more talks in Switzerland and repeated that while progress had been made from a military perspective, \"on the political direction it's more difficult\".During the interview, he also said he could not really \"understand\" Trump's relationship with the Russian President Vladimir Putin, adding \"for me it's very, very painful that his attitude to Putin is sometimes...more good than Putin deserves\".Next Tuesday will mark the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war, which has resulted in tens of thousands of military and civilian casualties and displaced millions across Ukraine, continues to shape the lives of Ukrainians, with daily deadly aerial attacks across the country.Four people were killed and 30 injured in Russian artillery and air strikes overnight on Tuesday. Power infrastructure too continues to be targeted across the country, leaving millions without light or heating in one of Ukraine's coldest winters in years.",

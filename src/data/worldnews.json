    "body": "US President Donald Trump is considering sending Tomahawk long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine, saying it would provide \"a new step of aggression\" in its war with Russia.When asked on Air Force One if he would send Tomahawks to Ukraine, Trump replied \"we'll see... I may\".It follows a second phone call at the weekend between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who pushed for stronger military capabilities to launch counter-attacks against Russia.Moscow has previously warned Washington against providing long-range missiles to Kyiv, saying it would cause a major escalation in the conflict and strain US-Russian relations.Tomahawk missiles have a range of 2,500 km (1,500 miles), which would put Moscow within reach for Ukraine.Trump spoke to reporters as he flew to Israel. He said he would possibly speak to Russia about the Tomahawks requested by Ukraine. \"I might tell them [Russia] that if the war is not settled, that we may very well, we may not, but we may do it.\"\"Do they [Russia] want Tomahawks going in their direction? I don't think so,\" the president said.Kyiv has made multiple requests for long-range missiles, as it weighs up striking Russian cities far from the front lines of the grinding conflict.In their phone calls Zelensky and Trump discussed Ukraine's bid to strengthen its military capabilities, including boosting its air defences and long-range arms. Ukrainian cities including Kyiv have come under repeated heavy Russian bombardment with drones and missiles. Russia has particularly targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, causing power cuts.Last month, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg suggested the US president had authorised strikes deep into Russian territory, telling Fox News \"there are no such things as sanctuaries\" from attacks in the Russia-Ukraine war.Russia, which launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, downplayed the chances of Tomahawks changing the course of the war.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said last month: \"Whether it's Tomahawks or other missiles, they won't be able to change the dynamic.\"Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "3 hours agoStephen McDonellChina correspondent andNick Edserbusiness reporterDonald Trump's latest threat to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods is \"a typical example of US double standards\", China's government has said.A commerce ministry spokesperson also said China could introduce its own unspecified \"countermeasures\" if the US president carries out his threat, adding it was \"not afraid\" of a possible trade war.On Friday, Trump hit back at Beijing's move to tighten its rules for rare earths exports, accusing it  of \"becoming very hostile\" and trying to hold the world \"captive\". He also threatened to pull out of a meeting with China's President Xi Jinping later this month.But on Sunday, Trump wrote: \"Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!\" \"Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn't want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!\" Trump said in a post on social media, without elaborating further. Trump's comments on Friday rattled financial markets, with the S&P 500 share index closing down 2.7%, its steepest fall since April.On Monday, the Shenzhen Component Index in mainland China was down by more than 2.5%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng was around 3.5% lower.The president's words renewed fears of a trade war between the US and China.In May, the two sides had agreed to drop triple-digit tariffs on each others' goods. which had raised the prospect of trade halting between the two countries.This left US tariffs on Chinese goods facing an added 30% levy compared with the start of the year, while US goods entering China face a 10% tariff.China's response - released by the commerce ministry in the form of written responses to journalist's questions - echoed language from the height of the recent trade conflict.They criticised US export restrictions on chips and semi-conductors as well as defending China's own export controls on rare earths as \"normal actions\" to safeguard national security and that of all nations.The spokesperson said that for \"a long time\", the US had \"overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures\" and \"adopted discriminatory practices against China\".\"Resorting to tariff threats is not the right way to engage with China,\" the spokesperson said.\"China's position on a tariff war has always been consistent: we do not want one, but we are not afraid of one.\"Last week, China announced it was tightening export controls on rare earths and other materials critical for advanced tech manufacturing.This was seen as key move, as the country processes about 90% of the world's rare earths, which are used in goods such as solar panels and smartphones.The recent comments from Washington and Beijing are being seen by some as a means of strengthening positions ahead of future trade talks.It is unclear whether a meeting between Trump and Xi, expected at a summit in South Korea later this month, will still proceed.",

    "body": "20 hours agoCarrie DaviesPakistan correspondent,Stuart Lau andEthirajan AnbarasanThe Taliban government has confirmed that it attacked Pakistani troops in multiple mountainous locations on the northern border.A Taliban spokesman said 58 Pakistani military personnel had been killed in what it called \"an act of retaliation\". It claimed Pakistan had violated Afghan airspace and bombed a market inside its border on Thursday.Pakistan has disputed that figure, saying 23 of its armed forces' members had died and claiming that \"200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralized\". Pakistan's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said the Afghan attacks were \"unprovoked\" and civilians were fired at, warning that his country's forces would respond \"with a stone for every brick\".Islamabad has accused Kabul of harbouring terrorists who target Pakistan on its soil, a claim the Taliban government rejected.Both the Afghan and Pakistani sides are said to have used small arms and artillery in the Kunar-Kurram region, the BBC understands.At a press conference on Sunday, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in addition to the 58 Pakistani military deaths, around 30 others had been wounded.He added that nine Taliban fighters had died and between 16 and 18 people had been injured.Pakistan Armed Forces said 29 of its soldiers had been injured, and the number of wounded Taliban and \"affiliated\" fighters was in the hundreds.Afghanistanâ€™s foreign minister said in a press conference in New Delhi that \"we have no problems\" with Pakistan's people and its leadership but added \"there are some groups in Pakistan that are trying to spoil the situation. Afghanistan has a right to keep its territory and its borders safe, and so it has retaliated to the violation.\"Pakistan's interior minister said he \"strongly condemns\" the Taliban's attacks: \"The firing by Afghan forces on civilian populations is a blatant violation of international laws.\"Afghanistan is playing a game of fire and blood,\" he said in a post on X.The two main crossings between Pakistan and Afghanistan - Torkham in the north and Chaman in the south - have been closed, leaving hundreds of trucks carrying goods stranded on both sides. A Pakistani military spokesman said they would take necessary measures to safeguard Pakistani lives and properties.Pakistan's military has not officially commented, but a security source speaking to the BBC claimed that firing took place at several locations along the Pakistani-Afghan border, including Angoor Adda, Bajaur, Kurram, Dir, Chitral and Baramcha.A police official stationed near the Zero Point in Kurram district told the BBC that heavy weapons fire began from the Afghan side around 22:00 local time (17:00 GMT).He said they had received reports of intense gunfire from multiple locations along the border.Last week, Afghanistan's Taliban government accused Pakistan of violating Kabul's \"sovereign territory\", as two loud blasts were heard in the city late on Thursday.Pakistan bombed a civilian market in the border province of Paktika, in Afghanistan's south-east, the Taliban Defence Ministry said on Friday. Locals there told the BBC's Afghan service that a number of shops had been destroyed.A top Pakistani general alleged Afghanistan was being used as a \"base of operation for terrorism against Pakistan\". Pakistan has long accused the Afghan Taliban of permitting the Pakistan Taliban,  known as the TTP, to operate from their land and fight against the Islamabad government in a bid to enforce a strict Islamic-led system of governance. The Afghan Taliban government has always denied this.The latest escalation coincided with an historic week-long trip to India made by Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, his first since the Taliban's return to power. In a diplomatic thaw, New Delhi said that it would reopen the embassy in Kabul, which was shut four years ago.\"Afghanistan will also be given a befitting reply like India, so that it will not dare to look at Pakistan with a malicious eye,\" Naqvi warned.In a statement, Saudi Arabia, which signed a mutual defence pact with Pakistan last month, called for self-restraint and avoidance of escalation between Islamabad and Kabul.Qatar also expressed concern over the Pakistan-Afghanistan border tensions, calling on both sides to \"prioritise dialogue, diplomacy, and restraint\".",

He pivoted the West African state towards Russia in a bid to stem a growing insurgency by jihadists. He expelled French troops, and brought in mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group, which is under Moscow's defence ministry. They have since been replaced by Africa Corps. Last week, Burkina Faso's military government refused to take in deportees from the US, as Washington suspended issuing visas in the West African nation.Foreign affairs minister Karamoko Jean-Marie TraorÃ© questioned if the embassy's decision was \"blackmail\" after he said he had rejected a US proposal to take in migrants from third countries.The Trump administration has turned to African countries as a destination to deport migrants to as part of its crackdown on immigration.",

    "body": "2 days agoNorberto ParedesBBC Mundo andAlex BoydWatch: 'A great honour for Venezuelan society' - Machado speaks to the BBCNobel Peace Prize winner MarÃ­a Corina Machado has told the BBC she is grateful for what US President Donald Trump is doing \"around the world for peace\".Machado, Venezuela's opposition leader, was awarded the 2025 prize having long campaigned against the country's President NicolÃ¡s Maduro Moros, whose 12-year rule is viewed by many as illegitimate.She told BBC Mundo that during a congratulatory phone call with Trump she told him \"how grateful the Venezuelan people are for what he's doing, not only in the Americas, but around the world for peace, for freedom, for democracy\".Trump has made no secret about wanting to win the award himself, regularly speaking about the seven wars he claims to have ended.Nominations for the award closed in January, just as Trump's second term as president began. A White House official said on Friday the \"Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace\".Machado said she was \"very glad\" to speak to the US president and was \"able to convey to him our appreciation\".The 58-year-old, forced to live in hiding for much of the past year, was hailed by the Nobel Committee as \"one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times\".Nobel chairman JÃ¸rgen Watne Frydnes said she was recognised for \"her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy\".He added: \"Despite serious threats against her life, she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions.\"Machado was barred from running in last year's presidential elections, in which Maduro won a third six-year term in office.The elections were widely dismissed on the international stage as neither free nor fair, and sparked protests across the country.Even after she was barred from the polls, she managed to unite the notoriously divided opposition faction and succeeded in getting millions of Venezuelans behind the little-known candidate which replaced her on the ballot, Edmundo GonzÃ¡lez.When the government-controlled National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner - even though tallies from polling stations showed that GonzÃ¡lez had won by a landslide - Machado continued to campaign from hiding as the Maduro government has repeatedly threatened her with arrest.Machado told BBC Mundo her award was \"like an injection\" for her political movement.\"It infuses energy, hope, strength on the Venezuelan people because we realise that we are not alone,\" she added. \"The democrats around the world share our struggle.\"She said she thought Trump and the international community were already helping with the political situation in Venezuela.\"The regime in Venezuela is a criminal structure,\" Machado told the BBC. \"And as such, it sustains themselves on the criminal flows from their illicit activities.\"We need the international community to cut those flows that are not only used for corruption, but also for repression, violence and terror.\"So when you cut the inflows that come from drug trafficking, gold smuggling, arms smuggling, human trafficking, or the black market of oil, then the regime falls.\"And that's exactly what we're seeing, cracks that are getting deeper and deeper as we talk right now.\"Earlier this month, US forces killed four people in an attack on a boat off the coast of Venezuela that was allegedly trafficking drugs.It was the latest in a number of recent strikes by the US on boats in international waters it said were involved in \"narco-trafficking\".They have attracted condemnation in countries including Venezuela and Colombia, with some international lawyers describing the strikes as a breach of international law.On Thursday Colombian President Gustavo Petro said one of the boats was \"Colombian with Colombian citizens inside\", an allegation the White House called \"baseless\".",

The election went to a run-off after neither candidate won an outright majority in the first round two weeks ago.A former parliamentary speaker, Herminie was charged with witchcraft in 2023 in what he said was a politically motivated attempt to thwart his presidential ambitions. The charges were dropped in 2024, paving the way for him to run for office. \"I will be the president of all Seychellois, and I will end divisions by ceasing preferences and giving everyone the opportunity to thrive,\" Herminie said in his victory speech. Ramkalawan is the latest incumbent to lose elections in Africa, with Malawi's President Lazarus Chakwera voted out of power last month amid growing discontent with the rising cost of living.Herminie's party, United Seychelles (US), won parliamentary elections with a solid majority last month, regaining control after previously losing it to Rakalawan's Linyon Demokratik Seselwa (LDS).",

    "body": "14 hours agoRushdi AbualoufGaza correspondent in IstanbulAt least 27 people have been killed in fierce clashes between Hamas security forces and armed members of the Dughmush family in Gaza City, in one of the most violent internal confrontations since the end of major Israeli operations in the enclave.Masked Hamas gunmen exchanged fire with clan fighters near the city's Jordanian hospital, witnesses said.A senior official in the Hamas-run interior ministry said security units surrounded them and engaged in heavy fighting to detain them. The ministry said eight its members were killed in \"an armed assault by a militia\".Medical sources said 19 Dughmush clan members and eight Hamas fighters had been killed since fighting began on Saturday.Eyewitnesses said the clashes erupted in the Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood in southern Gaza City after a Hamas force of more than 300 fighters moved to storm a residential block where Dughmush gunmen were entrenched.Residents described scenes of panic as dozens of families fled their homes under heavy gunfire, many of them displaced multiple times during the war. \"This time people weren't fleeing Israeli attacks,\" one resident said. \"They were running from their own people.\"The Dughmush family, one of Gaza's most prominent clans, has long had a tense relationship with Hamas, and its armed members have clashed with the group on several occasions in the past.The Hamas-run interior ministry said its forces were seeking to restore order, warning that \"any armed activity outside the framework of the resistance\" would be dealt with firmly.Both sides traded accusations over who was responsible for triggering the clashes.Hamas earlier said Dughmush gunmen killed two of its fighters and wounded five others, prompting the group to launch an operation against them.However, a source from the Dughmush family told local media that Hamas forces had come to a building that once served as the Jordanian Hospital, where the family had taken refuge after their homes in the al-Sabra neighbourhood were destroyed in the recent Israeli attack.The source claimed that Hamas sought to evict the family from the building to establish a new base for its forces there.Hamas has recalled about 7,000 members of its security forces to reassert control over areas of Gaza recently vacated by Israeli troops, according to local sources.Reports suggest armed Hamas units have already deployed across several districts, some wearing civilian clothes and others in the blue uniforms of the Gaza police. The Hamas media office denied it was deploying \"fighters in the streets\".",

    "body": "2 days agoRushdi AbualoufGaza correspondent in IstanbulHamas has recalled about 7,000 members of its security forces to reassert control over areas of Gaza recently vacated by Israeli troops, according to local sources.The Palestinian group also appointed five new governors all with military backgrounds, some of whom previously commanded brigades in its armed wing.The mobilisation order was reportedly issued via phone calls and text messages which said the aim was to \"cleanse Gaza of outlaws and collaborators with Israel\" and told fighters to report within 24 hours.Reports from Gaza suggest armed Hamas units have already deployed across several districts, some wearing civilian clothes and others in the blue uniforms of the Gaza police. The Hamas media office denied it was deploying \"fighters in the streets\".Tensions rose sharply and quickly after two members of Hamas's elite forces were shot dead by gunmen from the powerful Dughmush clan in Gaza City's Sabra neighbourhood. One of them was the son of a senior commander in Hamas's armed wing, Imad Aqel, who now heads the group's military intelligence.Their bodies were left in the street, triggering anger and raising the prospect of a major armed response by Hamas.Hamas members later surrounded a large area where more than 300 Dughmush gunmen were believed to be holed up, armed with machine guns and improvised explosives.This morning Hamas killed one Dughmush clan member, and reportedly kidnapped another 30.Some of the clan's weapons were looted from Hamas depots during the war, while others had been in the clan's possession for years.Palestinians return to devastation in Gaza CityWhat we know about the Gaza ceasefire agreementWho are the 48 hostages still held in Gaza?The Hamas mobilisation had been widely anticipated amid growing uncertainty about who will govern Gaza once the war ends.This is a key issue that could complicate the start of the second phase of US President Donald Trump's peace plan, which calls for Hamas to disarm.A Hamas official abroad declined to comment directly on reports of the security deployment, but told the BBC: \"We cannot leave Gaza at the mercy of thieves and militias backed by the Israeli occupation. Our weapons are legitimate... to resist occupation, and they will remain as long as the occupation continues.\"A retired security officer who served for years with the Palestinian Authority in Gaza said he feared the territory was sliding towards another round of internal bloodshed. \"Hamas hasn't changed. It still believes that weapons and violence are the only means to keep its movement alive,\" he told the BBC. \"Gaza is flooded with arms. Looters have stolen thousands of weapons and rounds of ammunition from Hamas stores during the war, and some groups have even received supplies from Israel. \"This is a perfect recipe for civil war: weapons, frustration, chaos, and a movement desperate to reassert control over a shattered and exhausted population.\"Khalil Abu Shammala, a human rights expert who lives in Gaza, said it remained to be seen whether Hamas would accept handing over control on the ground or seek to obstruct the plan's implementation.  \"There is undoubtedly widespread fear among many Gazans of potential internal fighting, given the many conditions that could fuel it,\" he said.He said Hamas had been forced to accept the peace plan by the severe pressure it was under.\"I believe its continued attempts to maintain influence by any means, including involvement in security affairs, could ultimately jeopardise the agreement and plunge Gaza's residents into even greater suffering,\" he said.These developments since the ceasefire earlier this week have sparked deep concern among Gazans already worn down by two years of a devastating conflict.",

    "body": "2 days agoTim FranksPetah TikvaBBCDr Steinman says working at the unit has taught her the \"strength of the human spirit\"When the first hostages are released by Hamas in Gaza, taken into Israel and transferred by helicopter to the Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva, Dr Michal Steinman will take them up to the sixth floor, swipe open the glass door and see them reunite with their closest family after more than 700 days in captivity.\"It is a privilege,\" says the head of nursing. \"These are the moments, when I'm 70 or 80, these are the two or three moments I will remember. They symbolise so many values â€“ as a nurse, as a mother, as a woman, as an Israeli.\"Twenty living hostages are due to be released under the terms of the agreement between Israel and Hamas. Several of them will be brought to this hospital.It will be the third time that the hostages' unit has gone operational. The BBC visited the unit on Saturday, when the medical team learned the identities of the hostages they would be treating.\"There is no such field as captivity medicine, and we are inventing it,\" said Dr Steinman told the BBC. The staff have learned two big lessons from the two previous hostage releases in November 2023 and January this year, she says.  The first is to be \"a medical detective\", to try to understand what happened in those long days and nights of captivity.  With earlier, often emaciated, shackled, beaten hostages, \"they had things in their blood exams, in their enzymes, that we couldn't understand\".  Follow live updatesWho are the 48 hostages still held in Gaza?What we know about the Gaza ceasefire agreementPalestinians return to devastation in Gaza CityThey also have learned that symptoms may not present for days or weeks.  \"Captivity does things to your body that your body remembers. You see all these layers. It takes time to see what happened to their bodies, to their souls,\" she said.  \"We're still taking care of the hostages who came back in January and February, and every week we discover new things.\"ReutersIt's the third time the hospital's unit has received freed hostages after previous release deals in late 2023 and January this year (file photo)The other lesson is to take time. There are a huge number of professionals from different disciplines: nutritionists, social workers, mental health specialists, along with the full panoply of medical staff.  But there is also a \"do not disturb\" card on the door of each released hostage's private room. The echoes of a hotel are deliberate, as are the care packages and soft furnishings and soft lighting to go with the hospital bed and monitors. There is an extra single bed made up for those hostages who don't want to be left alone overnight, so that a partner or relative can sleep alongside them. Their closest family will also have their own bedroom directly across the corridor from the hostage's.\"You know medical people are task-oriented. There's a schedule,\" says Dr Steinman. \"Here you have to give them much more space. You have to decide what's urgent, and what can wait another two days. You have to be humble and flexible, without letting go of your medical responsibility.\"Among those responsibilities is determining what the hostages, some of whom may have lost more than half their body weight in captivity, can eat, and how quickly.Their physical recuperation is only part of the story. Karina Shwartz is director of social work at the Rabin Medical Center.  She is another key member of the team, with a responsibility not just for the hostages but for their closest relatives. They need to learn their own delicate calibration of family dynamics â€“ of when to speak and when not to, she says.\"The most important thing is what we're not saying,\" she says. \"Because if we're sitting in the room, and someone tells us something very difficult about how they almost died in captivity, and we stay silent: it's a very loud silence.\"But at the same time, there is a need to hold back. \"We can't speak about two years in a week. The hostages need space and time. They also need quiet. We have to listen. To listen to their story.\"Karina Shwartz and her team will prepare the hostages to leave the hospital and re-enter the outside worldThe staff in the hostage returns unit emphasise that their job does not end when the hostages return home. Medical and psychological rehabilitation will continue and the hostages must also be prepared, says Ms Shwartz, for the moment \"when the real world comes in\".  The message she and her team try to drill into the hostages and their families is that everyone will want to see them. For two years they have been public figures.\"Everyone will want to be friends.  We tell them: it's okay to say no. It's safe to say no.\"For now, the nervous anticipation among the staff is palpable.\"You should see my WhatsApp messages,\" says Dr Steinman, a very Israeli director of nursing with her nose piercing and multiple tattoos. Pretty much every single one of her 1,700 nurses across the medical complex has, she says, volunteered to pull extra shifts on the unit.  \"You gain hope again,\" she says. \"Working here you realise that life and human beings are good. You realise the strength of the human spirit.\"And yet, the greatest pleasure, she says, will be for that work to be over. \"This is the third time we're opening the unit.  To know that this is the last time: that when we close this place and say the mission is done.  Then we will know that the nightmare is over.\"",

    "body": "Trump directs Pentagon to 'use all available funds' to pay troops during shutdownDonald Trump is directing US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth to pay military personnel despite the federal government shutdown. The president said on Saturday that Hegseth must make sure troops do not miss out on their regular paycheque, scheduled for Wednesday. The directive comes as other government employees have already had some pay withheld and others are being laid off.\"I will not allow the Democrats to hold our Military, and the entire Security of our Nation, HOSTAGE, with their dangerous Government Shutdown,\" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. The Republican and Democratic parties blame each other for failing to agree on a spending plan to reopen the government.Trump's message asks Hegseth to \"use all available funds to get our Troops PAID\" on 15 October, when military personnel would see their pay withheld for the first time since the shutdown began on 1 October.Many US military employees are considered \"essential\", meaning they must still show up for duty without pay. Some 750,000 other federal employees - about 40% - have been furloughed, or sent home, also without pay.Furloughed employees are legally supposed to receive back-pay after a shutdown ends and they return to work, but the Trump administration has insinuated this might not happen.\"The Radical Left Democrats should OPEN THE GOVERNMENT, and then we can work together to address Healthcare, and many other things that they want to destroy,\" Trump posted on Saturday.Democrats have refused to vote for a Republican spending plan that would reopen the government after nearly 12 days shut down, saying any resolution must preserve expiring tax credits that reduce health insurance costs for millions of Americans and reverse Trump's cuts to Medicaid, the healthcare program for elderly and low-income people.Republicans accuse Democrats of unnecessarily bringing the government to a halt, and blame them for the knock-on effects caused by the federal work stoppage.Finding a way to pay for military salaries could help reduce some of the political risk  for congressional leaders if the shutdown drags on.In an effort to pressure Democrats, the Trump administration has also begun laying off thousands of government workers, an unprecedented move during a shutdown.\"The RIFs have begun,\" White House Office of Management Director Russell Vought announced in a post on X on Friday morning, referring to an acronym for \"reductions in force\".The administration disclosed later on Friday that seven agencies had started firing more than 4,000 people, making good on the president's repeated threats to use the shutdown to further his long-held goal of reducing the federal workforce.The reductions included dozens of employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), according to the BBC's US partner CBS news, citing sources familiar with the situation. The agency's entire Washington DC office was laid off, the sources told CBS, adding that among the laid-off employees were those working on the CDC's Mortality and Morbidity Weekly Report, the agency's Ebola response and immunisations. There were also reductions in the human resources department, they said. Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, told CBS that the let-go workers were not essential, and that \"HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities, including those that are at odds with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda\".Employees at the Treasury Department and in the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in the Department of Homeland Security were also among those laid off on Friday, those agencies confirmed.   The American Federation of Government Employees and AFL-CIO, two major unions representing federal workers, have filed a lawsuit in northern California, asking a judge to temporarily block the layoff orders. \"It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country,\" AFGE president Everett Kelley said.A spokesman from the White House budget office told the BBC on Saturday that the layoffs were just the beginning.\"These RIF numbers from the court filing are just a snapshot in time,\" he said. \"More RIFs are coming.\"In a court filing opposing the unions' request for a temporary restraining order, the justice department revealed that agencies such as the Departments of Education, Housing and Urban Development, Commerce and Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency could also see staff cuts. The government lawyers said the labour unions had failed to establish that their members would be irreparably harmed by the layoffs, which is needed for the judge to grant the restraining order. But they said a restraining order would \"irreparably harm the government\". Are you a federal worker in the US? Get in touch here",

    "body": "For over two months, Paramjit Singh, 48, a US green card holder battling a brain tumour and a heart condition, has been held in a detention centre by US immigration authorities.Mr Singh, an Indian passport holder, has lived in the US on a green card since 1994. He lives in Indiana with his family, who own a chain of gas stations. His wife and two children are US citizens.But Mr Singh now faces the threat of deportation. On 30 July, he was detained by immigration authorities at Chicago O'Hare International Airport while returning from a trip to India and has since been in their custody.US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) authorities have cited two decades-old cases as reasons for his detention, but Mr Singh's family and lawyer say there are no active cases against him. They accuse immigration authorities of using old cases to delay his release and allege he lacks proper medical care despite a brain tumour and heart condition.\"Paramjit Singh is not getting the medical help he needs. He is only getting medical check-ups,\" his lawyer, Louis Angeles, told the BBC.The BBC has asked ICE for a response to these allegations.Mr Singh has regularly visited India without immigration issues, his niece Kiran Virk told the BBC. This time, his family waited seven hours at Chicago airport for his arrival.Ms Virk says immigration officials told them Mr Singh was detained over a 1999 case. He was held at the airport for five days despite family appeals, before being moved to a Clay County detention centre in Indiana.The case involves Mr Singh using a public phone without paying. Court records show he served 10 days in prison and paid a $4,137.50 fine. The conviction has blocked his US citizenship.Ms Virk alleges immigration authorities said at a court hearing that Mr Singh still faced a one-and-a-half-year sentence, with only 10 days dismissed.Immigration authorities also say that Mr Singh was convicted of a forgery offence in Illinois in 2008, but his family contends that there are no such charges against him.Ms Virk said that the authorities cited the forgery case to stay Mr Singh's release on a $10,000 bond granted by an immigration judge.She said a private detective hired by the family found no criminal records for a person named Paramjit Singh in the state, suggesting authorities may have mistaken him for someone else.The BBC has asked ICE for a response to the family's claim that there is no forgery case against Mr Singh in Illinois.Sikh granny's arrest by US immigration sparks community angerWoman, 73, deported by ICE to India after three decades in USMr Singh's lawyer told the BBC he plans to challenge the detention, calling it \"unethical\".\"We are also taking legal steps to block him from being deported from the US,\" Mr Angeles told the BBC.Meanwhile, Mr Singh's family is increasingly worried about his health, as his second brain tumour surgery has been delayed due to detention, Ms Virk says.She says the family struggles to contact Mr Singh at the detention centre, where limited phones and his poor health make communication difficult.Mr Singh's case is set to be heard on 14 October. His detention comes amid a wider crackdown by US President Donald Trump's administration on immigration, and especially illegal immigrants in the US.Trump has said he wants to deport the \"worst of the worst\", but critics say immigrants without criminal records who follow due process have also been targeted.In September, Harjit Kaur, a 73-year-old grandmother who spent more than three decades living in the US was deported to India, sparking anger among the Sikh community.

    "body": "2 days agoRushdi AbualoufGaza correspondent reporting from IstanbulHamas is pressing Israel to include prominent Palestinians in a prisoner-release list -  part of a ceasefire deal that will also see hostages returned from Gaza.Hamas's insistence comes after the Israeli justice ministry published the names of 250 prisoners to be freed, but excluded seven high-profile prisoners, including Marwan Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat.The men, who are serving sentences after being convicted of involvement in separate deadly attacks in Israel, have long been seen by Palestinians as symbols of resistance.Twenty Israeli hostages are expected to be released before 12:00 (09:00 GMT) on Monday as part of the deal proposed by US President Donald Trump.A senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks told the BBC that US envoy Steve Witkoff had promised to raise the exclusion of the Palestinian prisoners with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but Israel has firmly refused to include them.It is not clear whether this could be a sticking point, or impact the timeline for the release of hostages from the Gaza Strip and Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.Follow live updatesHamas mobilises thousands of fighters in GazaWhat we know about the Gaza ceasefire agreementPalestinians return to devastation in Gaza CityThe releases are due to take place in the first phase of Trump's ceasefire and hostage return deal, approved this week to end the two-year war in Gaza.It is unclear how the hostages will be released this time - on previous occasions Hamas paraded them in public, infuriating Israel and many of its Western allies. The bodies of deceased hostages will also be returned. It is thought that at least 26 hostages are deceased, with the fate of two others unknown.Israel will also release about 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences in Israeli jails, and another 1,700 Palestinians from Gaza who have been detained.Hamas had submitted a list of prisoners it wanted released that included Barghouti and Saadat.Barghouti is serving five life sentences plus 40 years after being convicted in 2004 of planning attacks that led to five civilians being killed. Opinion polls have consistently indicated that he remains the most popular Palestinian leader, and that Palestinians would vote for him in a presidential election ahead of the current Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas or Hamas leaders.Barghouti remains a senior figure in the Fatah faction that dominates the PA, which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under Israeli control.Saadat, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), was sentenced to 30 years after being convicted in 2008 of heading an \"illegal terrorist organisation\" and involvement in attacks, including the assassination of an Israeli minister in 2001.Among the 250 prisoners set to be released is Iyad Abu al-Rub, an Islamic Jihad commander convicted of orchestrating suicide bombings in Israel that killed 13 people in the early 2000s.According to the Israeli justice ministry, he will be released either to Gaza or deported abroad.The BBC understands that Hamas is also pushing for some possible additional prisoner releases. These relate to Palestinian prisoners who were released years ago as part of an exchange for the hostage Gilad Shalit - and then were rearrested after 7 October.Hamas argues that since they were part of a previous hostage exchange, they should not be included in the 250 figure.In Israel, hospitals are preparing for the release of hostages as families await their return.The first phase of the Israel-Hamas deal saw a ceasefire take effect on Friday and Israeli forces partially withdraw from parts of Gaza. Hundreds of aid trucks a day are now expected to enter. The next phases are still being negotiated.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have returned from southern Gaza to Gaza City, weeks after fleeing the Israeli offensive that destroyed much of the city.Gaza's Hamas-run civil defence agency has said it is conducting recovery operations and pulling bodies from the rubble, with Palestinians still missing across the territory.Israel's war on Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.Since then, 67,682 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military offensive in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says.Additional reporting by Mallory Moench",

    "body": "Indian student captured by Ukraine joined Russian army to avoid drug charges, says mother 1 day agoGopal KateshiyaBBC Gujarati, MorbiHasina MajotiSahil Majothi had gone to Russia to study computer engineeringUkraine has captured an Indian national allegedly fighting for Russian forces, the first known Indian detained in the ongoing war.Sahil Majothi, 22, from the Indian state of Gujarat, went to Russia to study computer engineering two years ago. His mother claims he was falsely accused in a drug case last April.Mr Majothi joined the Russian army to avoid imprisonment over drug charges,  according to a video released by Ukraine's army on Tuesday.The Indian foreign ministry says it is investigating the case and has not received formal communication from Ukraine. The BBC has asked the Russian government for a response. In an interview with BBC Gujarati, Mr Majothi's mother Hasina Majothi said her son went to Russia in January 2024. He completed a three-month language course in St Petersburg before moving to Moscow for college, supporting himself part-time as a kitchenware courier.She alleges that in April 2024, someone slipped drugs into a parcel handed to Mr Majothi during his deliveries.\"The police caught him with it and charged him,\" Ms Hasina said. According to Ms Hasina, her son was detained, held for six months and later sentenced to seven years in prison. The family hired a private lawyer in Russia to defend him, but they had no idea when or how he was drafted into the military.\"I don't know how he ended up in Ukraine. I only found out through the viral video,\" Ms Hasina said.In the video released by the 63rd Mechanized Brigade of the Ukrainian army, Mr Majothi can be heard saying he was given a choice between joining the Russian army, with pay for his service, or serving jail time. He said he was told he would serve in the military for a year before being released. Mr Majothi claims that different people promised him varying amounts of money - from a hundred thousand to over a million roubles - but he never received any payment.He says he underwent 15 days of training in September 2024 and was sent to the battlefield a year later, on 30 September.The next day, on 1 October, Mr Majothi said he had an altercation with his commander, after which he separated from Russian soldiers. That was when he came across a Ukrainian dugout and asked them for help, he added.The BBC cannot independently verify the date or location of the video in which he makes these claims. Ukrainian army/FacebookMr Majothi says he underwent 15 days of training before being sent to the battlefield a year laterOn Wednesday, after the video went viral, Gujarat's Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS)  questioned Ms Hasina and her brother in Ahmedabad. Her relatives said she separated from her husband around her son's birth and supports her family as a seamstress while living with her maternal relatives.ATS officials confirmed Mr Majothi's arrest and subsequent detention in Russia. They said the family claimed to have had no contact with him since his arrest. At his former school in Morbi, teachers called Mr Majothi an \"average student\" but deeply motivated to fulfil his mother's dreams through education. They spoke on condition of anonymity.Local community leaders have also appealed to the government to intervene and secure his return. \"Many young men like him have been trapped and dragged into the war,\" said  Kasam Sumra. \"We appeal to the government to bring back Sahil and other young Indians who went abroad seeking work.\" Mr Majothi's arrest comes amid rising concerns over Indians being recruited into the Russian military. Reports say over 150 Indians, some on student or visitor visas, have enlisted. At least 12 have died in the conflict and 16 remain missing.In September, Indian officials urged Moscow to release and repatriate 27 Indian nationals who had been recruited into the army.The Indian government has consistently advised its citizens against participating in the ongoing war in Ukraine.\"We once again strongly urge all Indian nationals to stay away from offers to serve in the Russian army, as they are fraught with danger and risk to life,\" a spokesperson from India's foreign ministry said last month.Additional reporting by Roxy Gagdekar Chhara from Ahmedabad and Nikita Yadav from DelhiFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "1 day agoAlice CuddyTel Aviv andJaroslav LukivTel Aviv crowd boos as Witkoff thanks NetanyahuHundreds of thousands of people have held a rally in Tel Aviv, ahead of the expected release of Israeli hostages by Hamas.Addressing the crowds, US special envoy Steve Witkoff said the hostages \"are coming home\" and praised Donald Trump for making a Gaza ceasefire and hostage return deal possible.In Gaza, Palestinian officials said about 500,000 people had returned to northern Gaza - which lies in ruins - in the past two days, following the withdrawal of Israeli troops.Meanwhile Egypt confirmed it would host a summit on Monday to finalise an agreement aimed at ending the war.More than 20 leaders including Trump would attend the summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, an Egyptian presidential spokesperson said. French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer are confirmed to be travelling to Egypt on Monday.Trump is expected to visit Israel on Monday before heading to Egypt. His daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner also addressed the Tel Aviv rally on Saturday.Three members of Qatar's top administrative body - the Amiri Diwan - died in a car crash near Sharm El-Sheikh, the Qatari embassy in Egypt said on Sunday. Qatar has been mediating in the Gaza crisis.Under the ceasefire and hostage release deal announced on Thursday, Hamas was given 72 hours - until 12:00 local time (09:00 GMT) on Monday - to release all the 48 hostages it is still holding after two years of war, 20 of whom are assumed to be alive.A top Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, told AFP news agency that \"according to the signed agreement, the prisoner exchange is set to begin on Monday morning as agreed, and there are no new developments on this matter\".He said Hamas militants on the ground had not yet notified the movement's leadership about the logistics of the handover.Aviv Havron, whose family members were murdered and others kidnapped in the 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas, told the BBC in Tel Aviv: \"It's so important for the community... that they come back. Without this, we can't restart our lives.\"My sisters and two brothers in law were murdered. Seven of my family members were kidnapped - my older sister was kidnapped, her daughter, her grandchildren. Four bodies of Be'eri [community] members are still in Gaza,.\"ReutersCrowds at the Tel Aviv rally unfurled a banner praising TrumpShulamit and David Ginat, who also attended the Tel Aviv rally, told the BBC all the hostages must be saved. \"They're our brothers and sisters. We want to heal again. We want to stop the war, stop the pain and heal again,\" Shulamit said.Many in the crowd yelled \"Thank you, Trump!\" - but also booed when Witkoff mentioned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Speaking just afterward, the couple said they were angry at him over the failure to prevent the 7 October attack, the war and the failure to bring the hostages home sooner.\"He wants to continue the war only because he wants to stay prime minister,\" David said.Hamas mobilises fighters in Gaza as fears of internal violence mountHospital prepares for freed Israeli hostagesWho are the 48 hostages still held in Gaza?What we know about the Gaza ceasefire agreementIn Gaza, Hamas has called up thousands of fighters to reassert control over areas of Gaza recently vacated by Israeli troops, according to local sources.The Hamas mobilisation had been widely anticipated amid growing uncertainty about who will govern Gaza once the war ends and fears of internal violence. There have also been reports of armed clashes between Hamas and Gaza clans.Displaced Palestinians have continued to move north in Gaza in large numbers, in many cases arriving to find their homes destroyed.\"There is no house anymore. Everything is gone,\" lawyer Mosa Aldous said over the phone from Gaza City.Watch: Palestinians crowd around trucks to grab aid in Khan YounisRaja Salmi, 52, told AFP she reached Gaza City's Rimal neighbourhood to find her home also gone.\"I stood before it and cried. All those memories are now just dust,\" she said.Under the terms of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, the amount of aid entering Gaza is due to be scaled up but the World Food Programme (WFP) told the BBC that a surge of aid lorries had \"not yet\" entered Gaza, reporting only two to three lorries entering the territory daily.With full access, WFP, a UN agency, said it intended to restore its regular food distribution system, boosting aid through 145 distribution points across Gaza.Cogat, the Israeli military body overseeing the entry of aid into Gaza, said 500 trucks had entered on Thursday of which around 300 were distributed inside Gaza by the UN and other organisations.A recent report by the world's leading hunger monitor Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), backed by the UN, estimated that 500,000 people in Gaza - a quarter of the territory's population - were suffering from famine.Israel has repeatedly denied that starvation is taking place in Gaza, and Netanyahu has said that where there is hunger, it is the fault of aid agencies and Hamas.About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 on southern Israel.Israel responded by launching a military offensive that has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

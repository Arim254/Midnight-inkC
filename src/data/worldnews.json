    "body": "Australian scientists have discovered a new native bee species with tiny horns - and given it a suitably devilish name. Researchers found the Megachile Lucifer while observing a rare wildflower that only grows in the Bremer Ranges in Western Australia's Goldfields region, 470km (292 miles) east of Perth.The \"highly distinctive, prominent horns\" are only on the female bee and may be used as a defence mechanism, to gather pollen or nectar, or to collect materials such as resin for nests.The study's lead scientist said she was inspired to use the name Lucifer as she was watching the Netflix show of the same name at the time. She adds it is the first new member of this bee group in 20 years. \"The female had these incredible little horns on her face,\" said Dr Kit Prendergast from Curtin University .\"When writing up the new species description I was watching the Netflix show Lucifer at the time, and the name just fit perfectly. I am also a huge fan of the Netflix character Lucifer so it was a no-brainer.\"Lucifer - which means \"light bringer\" in Latin - is also a reference to shining light on the need for better conservation of native bee species and greater understanding of how endangered plants are pollinated, she said. The report, which was published in the Journal of Hymenoptera Research, also called for the area in and around where the new bee species and rare wildflowers were found to be \"formally protected and gazetted as conservation land that cannot be cleared\".\"Because the new species was found in the same small area as the endangered wildflower, both could be at risk from habitat disturbance and other threatening processes like climate change,\" she said, adding that many mining companies do not include native bees when assessing the environmental impact of their operations.\"So we may be missing undescribed species, including those that play crucial roles in supporting threatened plants and ecosystems.\"Without knowing which native bees exist and what plants they depend on, we risk losing both before we even realise they're there.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoYvette Tan,Singapore and Hosu Lee,SeoulSquid Game star O Yeong-Su has been acquitted of sexual misconduct charges by a court in South Korea. The 81-year-old was charged in 2022 with sexually assaulting a woman twice.  The allegations said that he hugged the woman and kissed her on the cheek against her will.Mr O was found guilty in 2024 and given an eight-month suspended prison sentence, but said he would appeal against the verdict. On Tuesday, a court overturned his sentence, saying he had undergone classes on sexual violence and suggesting that the alleged victim's memory may have been \"distorted\", considering how long ago the incident occurred. The alleged assaults took place in 2017 when Mr O was staying in a rural area for a theatre performance. The alleged victim filed a complaint against Mr O in 2021, but the case was closed in April the same year. The prosecution later reopened the investigation \"at the request of the victim\", according to Yonhap agency. In a statement reported by local media outlets, the Suwon District Court said there was \"doubt\" as to whether Mr O had committed the assault. \"There is a possibility that the victim's memory has been distorted over time, and when there is doubt... the defendant must be given the benefit of the doubt\".However, the statement also went on to say that it was possible Mr O had committed assault, as he had apologised to the victim.The alleged victim later spoke out against the verdict, saying it would not \"invalidate the truth or erase the pain I have suffered\".\"Despite today's ruling, I will continue to speak the truth to the very end,\" she said in a statement released through women's rights organisation Womenlink. Womenlink also criticised the ruling, saying they were \"outraged by a ruling that once again conceals sexual violence in the theatre world\". It is not yet clear if the prosecution will appeal.Speaking to local media outlets after the court ruling, Mr O said he had \"gratitude to the court for its wise judgement\".Mr O rose to international fame after starring in Squid Game, a dystopian drama which sees people competing in deadly versions of traditional children's games.In 2022, he became the first South Korean actor to win a Golden Globe award for best supporting actor in a series, after his performance in the first season of the chart-topping Netflix thriller.",

    "body": "'This animal spared my life': Biologist bitten in head by shark hopes to meet it again4 hours agoRafael AbuchaibeBBC News MundoMauricio HoyosMauricio Hoyos has spent 30 years studying the behaviour of different shark speciesMauricio Hoyos still remembers the pressure that the jaws of a female Galapagos shark, over 3m (10ft) in length, exerted on his skull.The animal had lunged at him with astonishing speed, giving him barely enough time to duck his head in a last ditch effort to protect his jugular vein.\"When it closed its jaw, I felt the pressure of the bite, and then, after what I think was a second, it opened it again and it let me go,\" Hoyos told BBC Mundo from his home in Baja California, Mexico, a little over month after surviving the incident.Hoyos, a marine biologist with over 30 years of experience studying sharks in their natural habitat, was on a research trip in Costa Rica when he was attacked by the shark in September.Less than two months on, and still bearing the scars from the attack on his face, he describes his recovery as \"incredible\" - and says he even hopes to encounter his assailant again.Hoyos calls the shark bite \"a battle scar that looks like gills\"For Hoyos, what happened to him that day in the waters off Cocos Island is the result of normal animal behaviour when confronted with a perceived threat. \"In this case, this bite was like a dog's,\" he says.\"Have you ever seen how dogs, when another dog gets too close, throw a quick bite? It doesn't hurt it, but it calms the other dog down.\"Hoyos - who along with his colleagues attaches acoustic tags to sharks to help pinpoint their mating and spawning grounds as part of his work - was alerted to the shark's presence in the water by tourists.It was at a depth of 40m, and Hoyos told the captain of the boat he was on that he would be there \"for a maximum of five minutes\".He then entered the water and began his slow descent.Getty ImagesGalapagos sharks can grow 3m in lengthHoyos recalls encountering the shark: \"This giant female, measuring between 3 and 3.5m (11.5ft), swam by and headed toward the bottom, and I positioned myself to tag her at the base of her dorsal fin.\"But Hoyos, who has tagged many kinds of sharks in his decades-long career, says this animal reacted differently to others.\"Obviously the tip - the metal tip attached to the cable hanging from the probe - goes in, and unlike the other sharks I've tagged that immediately flee, she turns around and stares at me,\" he recalls.\"I saw her little eye looking at me, and I saw her very calmly turning around.\"Hoyos and his colleagues tag sharks with probes like this oneHoyos says he held the shark's gaze as it swam away - but then, suddenly, out of nowhere, it lunged at him.\"I lowered my head, and what I felt was its lower jaw digging into my cheek and its upper jaw into my head. I was there, I imagine for a second, no more, inside its jaw, and then it simply opened it again.\"\"When it closed it, I felt the pressure of the bite, and then it just let me go,\" he marvels.The Galapagos shark's 29 serrated teeth not only left Hoyos with deep wounds to his face and head, but also severed the air line of his diving apparatus.He had survived the shark attack but was still in mortal danger.In addition, one of the teeth had torn his diving mask, and the blood-tinged water was further blurring his already limited visibility.\"When I realised that no air was coming out of the hose, I grabbed a second one we have, which we call an octopus, that is used to give air to someone else if they need it,\" he tells BBC Mundo. \"But then I realised that the regulator wasn't working and was blowing air instead of regulating it, so I had to remember my training and start regulating it with my lips.\"Bleeding, blinded, and with the air escaping, Hoyos calculated that he had less than a minute to reach the surface.\"Since I couldn't see anything, what I did was look for the light that I knew was the surface. I started swimming upwards, in a very coordinated manner, because I wanted to avoid erratic movements that would attract the shark.\"Mauricio HoyosHoyos had to use all the lessons he had learned during years of diving to survive the attackAfter Hoyos reached the surface, a young man pulled him aboard the boat, and when the captain saw his condition, he called the park ranger station to report the incident.Hoyos explained that he didn't feel the pain of his injuries until much later.\"Obviously, I had adrenaline in my system, but the bite didn't hurt that much. What hurt the most was the impact: when the shark bit me - an animal 3m long and at that speed - it was like being hit by a car. In fact, I ended up with a huge bruise all over my jaw; I thought it was broken.\"When they docked, a team of paramedics was ready to provide him with emergency care.Hoyos was lucky: as well as surviving the attack and the subsequent ascent, none of his wounds became infected, and the healing process took less time than anyone could have imagined.\"The doctors told me it was amazing: the attack happened on 27 [September], I had a 34-hour trip, they performed a surgical debridement [removing damaged tissue], and two days later they were already evaluating whether they could perform reconstructive surgery.\"It could have been far worse for Hoyos. According to the doctors, a young man who survived a Galapagos shark attack in the same area in 2017 had to remain in a hyperbaric chamber for almost a month because his wounds weren't healing properly.\"They told me my recovery had been incredible. After the surgery, the doctors confessed how worried they had been about an infection, because being on my face, it was a direct path to the brain.\"Mauricio HoyosSmiling broadly, Hoyos adds that he is already planning to get back into the water and has a diving trip booked for 14 November.And he says that after having survived an attack of this magnitude he has even more respect for the animals he studies.\"Many people think the oceans would be better off without sharks, but they really say that because they don't understand the crucial role sharks play in maintaining their delicate balance.\"Pointing to the large scar on his cheek, he says: \"This is the proof that this female spared my life; I can't put it any other way. And this will allow me to continue speaking well of sharks and advocating for their conservation in the future.\"Meanwhile, the Galapagos shark that had Hoyos in its jaws continues its natural life in the depths, and he hopes to see it again. And since he was able to mark it before it attacked him, that possibility exists.\"In January I'm going to Cocos Island, we have a trip from the 20 to 27. And obviously I'm going to Roca Sucia [where the attack happened], I'm going to dive down there,\" he says, undeterred.",

    "body": "The Princess of Wales and the Queen have joined services to mark Armistice Day in the UK as events took place around the world.Catherine stood at the ceremony at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, where the Last Post signalled the start of a national two-minute silence at 11:00 GMT to mark the end of World War One.Queen Camilla was at Paddington Station in London for the wreath-laying ceremony, having travelled by train.The Prince of Wales has also delivered a video message to young people, sharing his views on the importance of wearing a red poppy and to say that \"remembrance is for everyone\".It was the first time Catherine had attended the service at the National Memorial Arboretum.She laid a wreath in the centre of the armed forces memorial, watched by a crowd which included veterans and their families.Catherine appeared to take a moment of reflection before returning to her seat where she bowed her head as the crowd prayed for those who had been affected by conflict.The Prince of Wales' message was a virtual event for children between nine and 14 in the UK.In it he says: \"When we remember, we connect with service in a personal way.\"We learn from the courage of others, and we carry their stories forward, so they are not forgotten.\"It's not just about the past - it's about shaping who we become in the future.\"Remembrance teaches us empathy, resilience and responsibility.\"And when we wear a red poppy or take a moment of silence, we are saying, 'Thank you. We have not forgotten, and we will not forget'.\"Meanwhile, the service in Staffordshire featured the reading of a specially- commissioned poem by the arboretum's poet in residence, Arji Manuelpillai.\"A Sonnet For Us All captures the stories etched into the hundreds of memorials within the National Memorial Arboretum, it invites people to listen, reflect and consider the emotion that was the inspiration for these sculptures,\" Mr Manuelpillai said.\"These human connections, and the gentle responsibility to carry love forward, are themes that resonate not only with me, but also with HRH The Princess of Wales, for whom the importance of service and compassion lies especially close to the heart.\"Queen Camilla joined commuters on the 09:28 train from Chippenham in Wiltshire to Paddington where a service was held for service personnel and their families.Later on Tuesday, William will join the King and Queen at Windsor Castle where a reception will honour veterans who served in the Pacific during the Second World War.The event, which the Duke of Edinburgh and the Duchess of Gloucester will also attend, continues the commemorations for the 80th anniversary of VJ Day - or Victory over Japan Day.Elsewhere around the world French President Emmanuel Macron attended a wreath-laying ceremony in the Champs-Elysees in Paris to mark the signing of the armistice at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month.Meanwhile the Princess Royal is in Australia, visiting Brisbane's Galipolli Barracks where she laid a wreath.Along with her husband, Sir Timothy Laurence, Princess Anne also met current and former armed forces and their families.",

    "body": "3 hours agoCaroline Davies,Pakistan correspondent, Islamabad and Dearbail JordanPakistan: Suicide attack outside Islamabad court kills 12A suicide attack outside a court in Pakistan's capital Islamabad has killed 12 people and injured at least 27 others, the country's interior minister said.Mohsin Naqvi said a bomber was planning to attack the district courthouse but was unable to get inside.Naqvi said authorities would prioritise identifying the bomber, and that those involved would be brought to justice.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has alleged that extremist groups \"actively backed by India\" were involved.A spokesperson for the Indian government denied what they described as \"baseless and unfounded allegations\".In a statement, Sharif said that \"terrorist attacks on unarmed citizens of Pakistan by India's terrorist proxies are condemnable\".Jumaat Ul Ahrar, a splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), has claimed responsibility, according to local media. But two local journalists have told the BBC that the TTP's central leadership has sent messages to them saying it has no link to the explosion.Suicide blasts in Islamabad have been rare in recent years. Footage from the scene on Tuesday showed the remains of a burnt-out car and a police cordon in place.The 27 people injured are receiving medical treatment, Naqvi said.He added that the attacker detonated the bomb close to a police car after waiting for up to 15 minutes. Footage of the aftermath showed plumes of smoke rising from a charred vehicle behind a security barrier. The incident occurred at 12:39 local time (07:39 GMT).Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari said he \"strongly condemned the suicide blast\". A lawyer who said he was parking his car outside the court at the time described hearing a \"loud bang\".Rustam Malik told AFP news agency \"it was complete chaos\".\"Lawyers and people were running inside the complex,\" he added. \"I saw two dead bodies lying on the gate and several cars were on fire.\"Police cordoned off an area close to a district court in Islamabad after the blastIn a separate incident on Monday, a car exploded in India's capital Delhi, killing eight people and injuring a number of others. The Indian government has not called the incident a terror attack, although the case has been referred to the country's anti-terror body.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said following the attack: \"The conspirators behind this heinous act will not be spared. All those responsible will be brought to justice, no matter how deep the conspiracy runs.\"There is, however, no official word yet on what led to the blast.The last time Pakistan's capital was targeted by a suicide bombing was three years ago when a police officer was killed and several others injured.There have been suicide attacks in other parts of the country in the years since but not in Islamabad.

    "body": "3 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorThe prosecutor in Turkey's biggest city has accused popular mayor Ekrem Imamoglu of 142 corruption offences that command jail terms ranging from 828 to 2,352 years.Imamoglu, considered the main political rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has been in pre-trial custody since March on suspicion of corruption.The Istanbul mayor and his opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) deny any wrongdoing and accuse the president and his allies of launching a crackdown in response to Erdogan's decline in popularity.However, the city's chief prosecutor has targeted not just Imamoglu but 401 others, with allegations of running a criminal corruption network with the mayor as its \"founder and leader\".After an eight-month inquiry, prosecutor Akin Gürlek said the suspects, of whom 105 were in detention, had formed an enormous criminal organisation that had been engaged in taking and receiving bribes as well as money laundering.The cost in losses to the Turkish state amounted to 160bn lira (£2,9bn; $3.8bn), he said.Imamoglu, who is the secular CHP's candidate for presidential elections in 2028, has been cited on 12 counts of bribery, seven counts of money laundering from criminal proceeds and a further seven counts of fraud against public institutions and organisations.Anadolu news agency estimated the charges would carry a prison sentence of 2,430 years.The mayor's detention in March triggered widespread protests, hundreds of arrests and a police crackdown. Ever since, he has been held in Marmara prison on the outskirts of Istanbul. Apart from the corruption case, prosecutors have accused him of a raft of other offences including espionage and forging his university diploma, a qualification that has since been annulled.Turkish authorities deny the mayor's allegation that the judiciary is being used as a political tool. However, without a university diploma he cannot stand for the presidency in 2028.Party leader Özgür Özel wrote on X: \"This case is not legal, it is entirely political. Its purpose is to stop the CHP, which came first in the last elections, and to block its presidential candidate.\"He earlier told a meeting of the CHP's parliamentary group as that no-one else in their party would run for the presidency: \"His crime is to run for the next presidency of this country. He has no other crime!\"Imamoglu, 54, was first elected mayor in 2019 and he was re-elected in April 2024, defeating the governing AK Party candidate by almost a million votes.He has already appealed against a July jail term of a year and eight months for insulting and threatening the Istanbul prosecutor. He is also appealing against an earlier jail sentence for criticising election officials.The espionage case, launched two weeks ago, alleges that Imamoglu handed over data of Istanbul residents in return for international funding.Imamoglu has warned Turks to \"forget this espionage nonsense\".Party leader Özgür Özel has accused authorities of trying to invent offences to prevent the mayor's release from prison.\"Could he have committed electoral fraud, had a fake diploma, been a thief, a terrorist and a spy at the same time?\" he asked his parliamentary colleagues on Tuesday.",

It was so powerful that several vehicles nearby almost melted, and people could hear the blast from kilometres away.The police are still investigating what caused the blast but the fact that it happened in one of the most secure and busy areas of Delhi has shocked people.On one side is Chandni Chowk - a busy trading and clothing hub that is busier than usual at this time of the year due to the peak wedding season.And on the other side is the 17th Century Red Fort which attracts thousands of tourists every day.Sandwiched between the two is the road where the explosion took place. Within minutes, confusion and alarm spread from the scene to the rest of the city.Some readers may find the details below disturbingMohamed Hafiz, who lives less than 200m from the spot, said his house shook and he and others ran out thinking it was an earthquake.What he saw on the street terrified him: people were running in all directions, cars were on fire, and bodies lay on the road. Some locals were trying to help the injured.\"There was blood everywhere. People were in shock. The scene was too disturbing - I could even see body parts,\" he said.As local media broke the news, fear and panic swept through the city. Police declared a high alert, and neighbouring states quickly followed suit.ReutersA member from the forensic team investigates the area where the blast took placeAs we entered Delhi from the neighbouring suburb of Noida, we could see a long queue of vehicles at the border as policemen searched them one by one.Everyone - the people in the vehicles and the policemen - looked tense as they all appeared to be in disbelief that something like this had happened in their city for the first time in more than a decade.Beyond the crossing, most roads were deserted as we drove to Lok Nayak Hospital, where the injured had been taken. Outside, a large crowd had gathered behind police cordons. Confusion hung in the air as people searched for answers, and fellow journalists speculated about what might have caused the explosion.Onlookers were mystified and even scared. Rajesh Kumar, who works at a tea shop near the hospital, said he always believed the capital was the safest city in the country.He said that though the blast had shaken him, he still believed that the security forces would soon find out what caused it.\"My family in Uttar Pradesh [state] told me to leave, they panic easily. I am a little worried and shocked but I don't think Delhi has suddenly become unsafe,\" he said.Among the crowd were also several people who were looking for missing family members.One of them was Mohammed Azghar, whose brother was in the area where the blast took place.\"My brother has been missing since the explosion. We haven't had any contact with him,\" he said.\"We've searched around Red Fort, Chandni Chowk, everywhere but we can't find him.\"Mr Azghar said his brother used to drive an electric rickshaw. \"The police have confiscated the vehicle, which is fine, we don't mind that. But at least help us find my brother.\"I just want some news - good or bad.\"The injured were taken to Lok Nayak Hospital in DelhiAfter visiting the hospital, we drove to the site of the blast. It was jarring to see the roads empty here, as the area is usually teeming with people late into the night.There were only security personnel or journalists around. Officials had relaxed restrictions and journalists could go closer to the site.The scene there told the story of the blast. There were mangled remains of cars, rickshaws and tuk-tuks. Blood stains could still be seen on the road. Some of the vehicles were charred beyond recognition.Some locals had also gathered around. They looked visibly shaken and worried about their immediate future.Ram Singh, who drives a small vehicle to ferry goods from stockrooms to shops in the area, is worried about business being affected.\"I earn daily and I am worried how I might feed my family. I hope a sense of security soon returns. I hope the police will be able to restore trust fairly quickly,\" he said.\"And I hope this never happens in our city ever again. We are shaken but we should overcome this.\"",

    "body": "16 hours agoKelly Ng,Singapore, Jonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent and Lulu Luo,Cabanatuan, PhilippinesAt least six people have died after a super typhoon barrelled through the Philippines, mere days after an earlier storm left more than 200 people dead.Super typhoon Fung-wong brought floods and landslides, which caused most of the deaths. It also cut power across entire provinces. It later weakened into a typhoon. More than 1.4 million people were evacuated ahead of it making landfall in the Philippines. It is now heading for Taiwan, where more than 3,000 people have been evacuated.Fung-wong was the 21st typhoon to hit the South East Asian nation this year, at a time where many residents are still struggling to recover from back-to-back natural disasters.Fung-wong, known locally as Uwan, slammed into Aurora province on Luzon Sunday night with sustained winds of around 185 km/h (115mph) and gusts of 230km/h.The Philippines' meteorological service had earlier warned of destructive winds and \"high-risk of life-threatening\" storm surges from the \"very intense\" typhoon.In Cabanatuan, one of the worst-hit cities, the BBC saw residents rushing into their homes to pull out furniture and pets on Monday, desperate to salvage as many of their possessions possible as water levels rose.Although its wind speeds did not come up to par with some of the strongest storms in the Philippines' history, Fung-wong dumped large amounts of rain on the country, leaving some 4,100 houses either totally destroyed or partially damaged.Cabanatuan resident Mercidita Adriano and her family had trimmed trees near their home last week to prepare for the storm.When the winds and rain intensified, ten of them crowded into a small room, praying throughout the day that the typhoon would spare their house, she told the BBC. Part of their roof was torn off by the heavy rain.Large parts of the country are still under water although the levels have gone down as of Tuesday morning. It comes just days after typhoon Kalmaegi ripped through the same region, leaving tens of thousands of people reeling. And in September, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake hit the province of Cebu.While the Philippines is prone to natural disasters, this series of catastrophes is \"not routine\", the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in a statement on Sunday.\"It is a stark reminder of the escalating climate and seismic risks faced by vulnerable nations. Urgent support is needed to scale up relief efforts, prevent further loss of life and support the country as it recovers from this latest disaster,\" it said. ",

    "body": "Harshita was murdered a year ago - so why has her killer not been caught, family ask2 days agoYogita LimayeSouth Asia and Afghanistan correspondentFamily handoutHarshita Brella's body was discovered in the boot of a car in London on 14 November last yearOne year since Harshita Brella was strangled to death in the UK, there is a sense of disbelief in her family home in the Indian capital Delhi.\"Why has her killer not been caught yet? Neither the UK government nor the Indian government are doing anything,\" Harshita's mother Sudesh Kumari says, sobbing into her scarf. \"I want justice for my daughter. Only then will I find peace.\"Harshita's body was found in the boot of a car in Ilford, east London, on 14 November 2024, a day after her family contacted UK police to say they had not heard from her since 10 November.Police believe Harshita, 24, was murdered on that day in Corby, Northamptonshire,  by her husband Pankaj Lamba, who fled to India soon after the killing and is still on the run.The couple, both Indian nationals, had moved from Delhi to the UK, settling in Corby, earlier that year.Northamptonshire PoliceA CCTV picture of the murder suspect Pankaj LambaIn March this year, police in Northamptonshire charged him with murder. He also faces charges of rape, sexual assault and controlling or coercive behaviour.Harshita's sister Sonia Dabas is frustrated with the pace of investigations.\"We are very disappointed with the UK police. Maybe because we are not citizens of the UK, that's why they are not serious about this case. They are sending out a message that foreign nationals are not safe in the UK,\" she told the BBC.Roughly two months before Harshita was killed, on 3 September, she had filed a case of domestic abuse against her husband. He was arrested and later released on bail on condition that he did not harass, pester or intimidate Harshita. The Domestic Violence Protection Order (DVPO) expired four weeks later, on 1 October.Sonia accuses Northamptonshire Police of being negligent in following up on the domestic abuse case. \"That's when Pankaj figured out that the UK police are not really serious about this case and he felt he could get away with murder,\" she says.Four officers of the Northamptonshire Police are being investigated over their handling of Harshita's domestic abuse report and their interaction with her, by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).The IOPC told the BBC this week that their investigation was complete and had been shared with Northamptonshire Police. Northamptonshire Police say they have been given until mid-November to respond to the IOPC's findings.Northamptonshire Police said: \"This is an exceptionally complex case and with criminal proceedings now active in the UK, we are unable to go into detail about the investigation at this time. However, we can confirm that the Indian authorities have been made aware through the appropriate channels of the charging decision.\"The Indian government has told the BBC they are in touch with the UK government on the matter, but neither side answered clearly about whether an extradition notice for Pankaj Lamba had been forwarded to the Indian authorities.Ms Brella detailed the alleged abuse she suffered at the hands of her husband in a letterHarshita's family also told the BBC that they believe Pankaj Lamba is in India, being shielded by Indian police.\"He has relatives who are policemen. In March this year, he was seen on CCTV footage withdrawing money from a bank. Then how come he's not been found yet? This is all because of corruption,\" says Sonia. The family also says they have information that in the early months of this year, Pankaj was running a shop in Gurgaon, not far from where they live.\"They [the Delhi Police] are just killing time,\" Sonia says.The Delhi Police did not respond to Sonia's accusations. They told the BBC that they have acted on the basis of a dowry complaint filed by Harshita's parents against Mr Lamba and members of his family, including his parents and sister, who were arrested and are now out on bail. The Delhi Police also say they issued public notices earlier this year offering a reward for information about Mr Lamba, and the search for him is still under way.Harshita's mother Sudesh Kumari says she still cannot believe her daughter is gonePankaj Lamba's family home is in the village of Dharauli, about 40 miles (65km) north of Delhi, and not far from Gurgaon where Ms Brella's family believe he was sighted in March. His parents Sudesh and Darshan Lamba didn't want to be interviewed when the BBC visited. But they rejected all the charges against them and their son. They claim they have not had any contact with him since 10 November 2024 – the same day that Harshita's family last had contact with her.For Harshita's father, Satbir Singh Brella, the days are filled with visits to police stations and courts.\"My daughter was so straightforward, and kind hearted. A really terrible thing happened to her,\" he says.Her mother points to the shoes she's wearing. They're Harshita's and were among her possessions from the UK returned to her family by British officials who visited them in July.\"They are tight for me, but I feel close to her when I wear them,\" says Sudesh Kumari. \"Sometimes I feel she's still in the UK, I cannot believe she is gone.\"Additional reporting: Aakriti Thapar, Adnan Bhat, Sanjay Ganguly",

    "body": "3 hours agoGabija GataveckaiteBBC NI News Dublin Correspondent , Dublin Castle PA MediaCatherine Connolly was elected as the Republic of Ireland's 10th president in a landslide vote at the end of OctoberCatherine Connolly has said she will make sure all voices are nurtured and heard during her presidency.Speaking at Dublin Castle where she was inaugurated as the 10th president of the Republic of Ireland she said the country has been undergoing \"seismic changes\" since the end of the Cold War.She said she was looking forward to her first visit to Northern Ireland as president and that she would foster an inclusive dialogue across the island.Connolly was elected in a landslide vote at the end of October, defeating Fine Gael candidate Heather Humphreys.The 68 year old has taken over the role from Michael D Higgins, whose 14-year term ended at midnight.The inauguration ceremony at Dublin Castle was attended by politicians, judges and other invited guests.\"We can and should take real pride in the success of the Good Friday Agreement model of peaceful resolution of conflict,\" she said.Taoiseach (Ireland's prime minister) Micheál Martin congratulated Connolly on assuming office saying it was a \"happy and momentous\" day for her and her family.The Republic of Ireland's president is the country's head of state, however it is a non-executive role.On Tuesday morning, she travelled from Farmleigh at Phoenix Park to Dublin Castle with her husband, Brian McEnery, in a ceremonial motorcade.She was sworn into office in St Patrick's Hall by the chief justice.A service of prayer and reflection took place during the ceremony. Connolly was presented with the Presidential Seal and made a speech.Who attended the inauguration?PACEMAKERNorthern Ireland's First Minister Michelle O'Neill attended the ceremonyAs well as the taoiseach, tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Harris, senior Irish government ministers and judges attended the inauguration.First Minister Michelle O'Neill also attended the ceremony and was accompanied by Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald.However, in her inauguration speech, Connolly mistakenly called O'Neill Michelle Smith.Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly did not attended the inauguration.Little-Pengelly said she has a number of commitments in Belfast and Windsor for Remembrance Day on Tuesday.She wished the new president well and said she was hoping to have a phone call with her.PA MediaTaoiseach Micheál Martin and his wife Mary O'Shea at Dublin CastleIn the absence of Little-Pengelly, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) did not send a representative to the inauguration, with party leader Gavin Robinson insisting it was not a \"snub\".He said the party would be \"pleased\" to meet Connolly when she visits Northern Ireland in the future in her formal capacity.Ulster Unionist Party MLA Steve Aiken was the only unionist politician to attend the inauguration.He attended in place of party leader Mike Nesbitt who had other commitments.He said it is not a bad look that he is the only unionist attending the event.\"I actually understand the reasons why some of them weren't able to make it, because obviously Emma Little-Pengelly would be here in other circumstances, but today is Armistice Day,\" he told BBC News NI.\"And it's very important for her to be in Belfast and also to be with our head of state, the King, in Windsor Castle.\"There's no snub, or no snub are intended, and that's why I am here.\"I am here, I am a unionist, and we have a substantial part of the vote. So we are here and we are showing the respect due to the president.\"PA MediaMichael D Higgins and his wife Sabina arriving at Dublin CastleAfter the ceremony, the newly inaugurated president travelled to Áras an Uachtaráin, the official home of the Irish president, via motorcade.A state reception is taking place on Tuesday evening in Dublin Castle.Connolly has served as a TD (member of Irish parliament) since 2016 and her election as president will trigger a by-election in Galway West.She previously worked as a barrister and psychologist.",

    "body": "3 days agoNick ThorpeBudapest, HungaryOn the surface, the Hungarian prime minister's trip was exactly what he went to Washington for: luxuriant praise and an exemption from sanctions on Russian oil, gas and nuclear supplies.And all that just five months out from a difficult election.Look closer, however, and the picture is less clear cut. The US side struck a hard trade deal - and an expensive one for Hungary. And there's no progress on Viktor Orban's biggest headache: ending the war in neighbouring Ukraine, and with it the long shadow the conflict casts over Hungary.Let's look first at Orban's key win - an exemption from US sanctions, which a White House official told the BBC was time-limited to one year, although Péter Szijjártó, Hungary's foreign minister, said would be indefinite.The time span is interesting. Trump clearly wants to help his friend win the election in April. And the exemption even partially dovetails with the European Commission demand to all member states to end the import of Russian oil, gas and nuclear fuel by the end of 2027. What is missing, from an EU perspective, is any political commitment from Orban to meet that demand - a commitment made and fulfilled by the Czech government. And the EU is trying to tighten energy sanctions - to the fury of Hungary and Slovakia.Away from the media spotlight, the Hungarian energy company MOL has been upgrading two of its refineries - Százhalombatta in Hungary and the Slovnaft facility in Bratislava - to process Brent crude instead of the high-sulphur Urals crude which flows through Russian pipelines. On Friday, MOL said 80% of its oil needs could be imported through the Adria pipeline from Croatia, albeit with higher logistical costs and technical risks. So Orban's argument, which so impressed Trump, that Hungary, as a landlocked country, has no alternative to Russian oil may not strictly be true. Overall, Hungary and Slovakia have together paid Russia $13bn (£10bn) for its oil between its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the end of 2024. The one-year window granted by the US is nevertheless a valuable respite for Hungarian households this winter. Orban told pro-government reporters who travelled with him to Washington that otherwise utility bills \"could have gone up by up to three times in December\". Capping those bills by various means has been a central plank of his popularity in Hungary since 2013. Under the US exemption, Hungary can also continue to buy Russian gas through the Turkstream pipeline, which traverses the Balkans, and pay for it in hard currency ($185m in August alone) using a Bulgarian loophole. Orban has agreed to buy LNG from the US worth $600 million, according to Bloomberg.Another key part of the Washington deal is nuclear. Hungary agreed to buy US nuclear fuel rods for its Paks 1 nuclear power station (at a cost of $114m), in parallel to those bought from Russia's Rosatom and France's Framatome.Russian plans to finance and build the nuclear extension, called Paks 2, have been long delayed by technical and licensing issues. The US agreement to lift all nuclear sanctions on Hungary may help restart that project, but thorny problems remain. Hungary has also agreed to buy US technology to extend the short-term storage of spent nuclear fuel at Paks for between $100m and $200m.Perhaps the biggest part of the deal was a Hungarian commitment to buy up to 10 small modular nuclear reactors from the US, for somewhere between $10bn and $20bn. Hungary needs electricity to power the huge Chinese battery plants being built around the country. Smaller nuclear plants are less plagued by building delays, and are easier to licence.Finally, a currency swap deal - similar to a recent US-Argentina deal to prop up the peso - under which US and Hungarian central banks can exchange currency is being discussed.This would mean that in a future financial crisis in Hungary, the US central bank could feed dollars to Budapest, which boosts financial security in Hungary.So in summary, Hungary struck a deal to buy US gas, nuclear energy and unspecified weapons systems in exchange for a temporary waiver from US sanctions on Russian oil and gas. But it failed to get the re-introduction of the US-Hungary dual taxation system, abolished in 2022, which harms mutual trade. And it did not get a new date for a potential Trump-Putin summit in Budapest as part of efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war.Critics say energy dependence on Russia is being replaced by energy dependence on the US. The Orban government argues it is achieving greater diversity of supply.",

    "body": "4 hours agoYolande KnellMiddle East correspondent, JerusalemEPAFar-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir handed out sweets after the bill's first reading was approvedIsrael's parliament has passed the first reading of a bill proposing the death penalty for those it deems to be terrorists acting against the state - a requirement which means it is likely to be used only against Palestinians convicted of deadly attacks on Israelis.The bill - which has been condemned by the Palestinian Authority and human rights groups - was backed in the 120-seat Knesset by 39 votes to 16.Far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir - whose Jewish Power party brought the vote - celebrated late on Monday by handing out sweets. \"After the law is finally passed - terrorists will only be released to hell,\" he said. The bill must pass two more readings before becoming law.In the same session, the Knesset also approved the first reading of another controversial bill allowing the Israeli government to close a foreign media outlet without court approval. That vote was 50 in favour and 41 against.The legislation aims to turn a temporary order that allowed the closure of Qatari-owned Al Jazeera in May 2024, into a permanent law. It has been opposed by the government's legal advisers.While the death penalty does exist for a small number of crimes in Israel it has only been used twice since 1948 when the state was created. The last time was when the Nazi war criminal, Adolf Eichmann, was hanged in 1962, after a public trial.An amendment to the penal code was demanded by the Jewish Power party and signed off by the Knesset's National Security Committee, which said in a statement that its purpose was to \"nip terrorism in the bud and create a weighty deterrent\".The statement read: \"It is proposed that a terrorist convicted of murder motivated by racism or hatred towards the public, and under circumstances where the act was committed with the intent to harm the State of Israel and the rebirth of the Jewish nation in its homeland will be sentenced to the death penalty - mandatory.\"The clause about harming Israel makes it likely that Palestinians convicted of deadly attacks, but not Jewish Israelis, will be sentenced to death.The foreign ministry of the Palestinian Authority - which governs parts of the occupied West Bank - called the proposed law a \"new form of escalating Israeli extremism and criminality against the Palestinian people\".ReutersIsrael released almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza a month ago in exchange for 20 living Israeli hostages held by HamasBen-Gvir had long pushed for the death penalty bill to be brought to a Knesset vote, but such a move was previously opposed by Israeli political and security leaders who argued it could complicate efforts to free living Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.That is no longer a concern since their return after the start of the Gaza ceasefire last month.Ben-Gvir was one of just a few Israeli ministers who voted against the Gaza ceasefire deal which aimed to end the war. This saw 20 living hostages sent home in exchange for some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, including about 250 serving life sentences, many convicted of killing Israelis.\"A dead terrorist does not get released alive,\" commented Limor Son Har-Melech, a member of Jewish Power, and sponsor of the bill.In 2003, during the Second Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, a then-pregnant Har-Melech and her husband - who lived in a settlement in the occupied West Bank - were attacked by Palestinian gunmen while in their car. Her husband was killed and she was injured, leading her to give birth by an emergency caesarean section.She told the Knesset one of her husband's killers went on to be released in a previous exchange deal to bring home an Israeli soldier held captive in Gaza. She said he went on to command a deadly attack on another Israeli and take part in the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023, before he was killed during the Gaza war.Responding to the draft bill, Palestinian human rights organisations said its \"most alarming aspect\" would be that if it became law, it could be used to apply retroactively.They suggested its intent was \"executing collective death sentences that could target hundreds of Palestinian detainees from the Al-Qassam Brigades' elite forces who were arrested on or after 7 October\", referring to Hamas's military wing.Israel's justice minister has already said he is seeking Knesset legislation to set up a special criminal tribunal to try Gazans accused of involvement in the attacks of 7 October 2023, in a process that could result in death sentences being handed down to those convicted.Some 1,200 people were killed two years ago in the cross-border attack on southern Israel by several thousand armed Hamas fighters. In the war that it triggered, the Hamas-run health ministry said more than 69,000 people were killed in Gaza.ReutersIsraeli troops raided and shut down Al Jazeera's offices in Ramallah in September 2024The push by Israeli lawmakers to formalise what has become known as the \"Al Jazeera Law\" also follows on from the Gaza ceasefire.During the war, a ban imposed by Israel's ministry of communications forced Al Jazeera to close its office at a hotel in occupied East Jerusalem. The Israeli military then ordered the closure of the network's office in the West Bank city of Ramallah, claiming it was a threat to national security.Israel accused Al Jazeera of anti-Israel bias and of supporting Hamas in its news coverage. Al Jazeera has repeatedly denied such accusations and condemned Israel's actions.The new international media legislation would give the government permanent powers to stop foreign broadcasters in Israel, even outside times of war or national emergency and would remove the need for judicial oversight.Last year, when petitioning the High Court of Justice against the temporary order allowing sanctions on foreign broadcasters, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) argued that \"the law violates freedom of expression, the right to information and freedom of the press, and blocks citizens and residents from receiving a variety of information that does not fit the Israeli narrative or is not broadcast on Israeli media channels.\"The two controversial bills are expected to be prepared for second and third parliamentary readings.",

    "body": "7 hours agoJude SheerinGetty ImagesTexas Democrat Greg Casar has warned against healthcare \"betrayal\"A day after the US Senate passed a spending bill to end the longest-ever government shutdown, the budget fight now moves to the House of Representatives.The lower chamber of Congress is expected to vote this week on the funding measure. Unlike in the Senate, if House Republicans stay united, they don't need any Democrats to pass the budget. But the margin for error is razor thin.Here are four potential hold-ups for the budget, before it can clear Congress and land on the president's desk for signing into law.Will House Republicans budge on healthcare?A key sticking point throughout the shutdown has been a desire on the part of Democrats to attach to the spending bill a renewal of tax credits that make health insurance less expensive for 24 million Americans.Senate Republicans instead only agreed to grant Democrats a vote in December on whether to extend the subsidies –  something they had already offered weeks ago.And House Speaker Mike Johnson would not commit on Monday to allowing a vote in his chamber on the tax credits.This entails a fair degree of political risk for Republicans, however. If they torpedo the subsidies, health coverage premiums could rocket, handing Democrats a ready-made campaign issue for next year's midterm elections.Marjorie Taylor Greene, a conservative Republican congresswoman from Georgia, has broken ranks with President Donald Trump to warn that her party must ensure health insurance premiums do not spike.As the clock ticks down to the subsidies expiring by the end of December, Republicans are working out their plan.They want income caps on who can receive the tax credits, and are proposing the tax dollars bypass insurance companies and go straight to individuals - although the details are unclear.Watch: Moment US Senate approves bill that could end government shutdownHow intense will House Democratic opposition be?Out of power in Washington, where Trump's Republicans control the House and Senate, Democrats appeared finally to have some political wind in their sails after a handful of election wins last week in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City.But those victories, like the shutdown fight, have accentuated strategic tensions between the pragmatic and progressive, or left-wing, factions of the party.The Democratic left is furious at defectors who voted with Senate Republicans to pass the budget on Monday, seeing this as a capitulation to Trump.From that wing of the party, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said giving up the fight was a \"horrific mistake\". California Governor Gavin Newsom called it \"surrender\".Congressman Greg Casar of Texas, the chairman of the House Progressive Caucus, warned: \"A deal that doesn't reduce healthcare costs is a betrayal of millions of Americans counting on Democrats to fight for them.\"However, centrist lawmakers like Jared Golden of Maine, who represents one of the most conservative districts in the nation held by any Democrat, may cross the aisle.Golden, who recently announced he won't run for re-election, is likely to vote for the package, his office indicated to Axios, a political outlet, on Monday.Another moderate Democrat, Henry Cuellar of Texas, could help get the Republicans' spending plan over the line.\"It's past time to put country over party and get our government working again for the American people,\" he posted on social media on Sunday.ReutersRepublican Thomas Massie has repeatedly voted against stopgap funding extensionsDo Republicans have the votes?Republicans control the House, holding 219 seats against the Democrats' 213, but can only afford to lose two votes to pass the spending plan.While most House Republicans are expected to support the funding package, given that Trump backs it, fiscal hawks in the party will raise objections.Thomas Massie of Kentucky - who has repeatedly voted against such stopgap funding extensions - is expected to vote no.The proposed deal would leave the federal government on a path to keep adding about $1.8tn (£1.4tn) a year to its $38tn of debt.Rand Paul of Kentucky cited this spending glut as he became the only Republican in the Senate to vote against the budget.The Senate plan would extend funding only until January, but the conservative House Freedom Caucus wants a budget that would last longer and do more to rein in spending.\"Government, just do your job\" - Frustration at airports as shutdown delays continueWill travel chaos delay the return to Washington?House Speaker Mike Johnson has kept the chamber out of session for the last seven weeks to focus pressure on Senate Democrats to make a shutdown deal.Now he is urging lawmakers to start returning immediately to Washington with a vote set for Wednesday afternoon at the earliest.But members of Congress face the same flight delays that have plagued other Americans during the spending impasse.From Tuesday, the rate of reduction in US flights will increase to 6%. Cuts have been made as the nation's busiest airports reduce their capacity to cope with shutdown-related sickness by air traffic controllers, who have been working without pay during the shutdown. Record-cold temperatures and heavy snow have also hit the Great Lakes region in the Midwest, adding to the delays.",

    "body": "10 hours agoHugh Schofield,Paris and Rachel HaganGetty ImagesSecond-hand clothing platform Vinted is under investigation in France after some user accounts were found to be directing visitors to pornographic content.France's Children's Rights Commissioner Sarah El-Haïry said she had asked watchdog Arcom to examine the allegations first reported in French media.Vinted, which has 23 million users in France, has no age-verification procedure - meaning children and teenagers could have been exposed to pornographic material without having to show proof they were over 18.In a statement, the Lithuania-based company said it had a \"zero-tolerance policy regarding unsolicited communications of a sexual nature or the promotion of sexual services\".\"All inappropriate and illegal content is removed, and where necessary we take measures against users, including blocking them definitively from our site,\" it was cited as saying by the AFP news agency.Vinted is taking the situation \"very seriously\", it added. Reports first surfaced after some sellers showing photographs of swimwear or lingerie were found to be luring viewers to their personal pages on adult platforms such as OnlyFans. \"Predators have been using the sale of ordinary items of clothing to direct people to porn sites,\" El-Haïry said.France has recently issued warnings to other global e-commerce platforms, including Shein - headquartered in Singapore - after products including childlike sex dolls appeared in their marketing listings. French officials say the case against Shein forms part of a wider investigation into other major e-commerce platforms accused of allowing illicit products to be sold online.Paris prosecutors are examining whether Shein, AliExpress, Temu and Wish breached laws relating to violent, pornographic or \"undignified\" content accessible to minors.Shein and AliExpress are also being investigated specifically over the alleged dissemination of child-related pornographic material. The cases have been referred to the Paris Office des Mineurs, which handles offences involving the protection of children.Shein has already banned the sale of all sex dolls on its platform worldwide and says it is permanently blocking seller accounts linked to the items. The French consumer watchdog, the Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control, said descriptions of the dolls left \"little doubt as to their child-pornography nature\".",

    "body": "Previously unknown organ works by Johann Sebastian Bach have been presented and performed in Germany for the first time in 320 years.Germany's Culture Minister Wolfram Weimer called the discovery of the two pieces a \"great moment for the world of music\".They first caught the attention of the Peter Wollny, a researcher of the German composer and musician, in 1992 when he was cataloguing Bach manuscripts at the Royal Library of Belgium in Brussels.The organ works - the Chaconne in D minor BWV 1178 and Chaconne in G minor BWV 1179 - were undated and unsigned. Mr Wollny spent the next 30 years working to confirm the identity of the pieces.They were performed at the St Thomas Church in Leipzig, where Bach is buried and where he worked as a cantor for 27 years.The two pieces were played by Dutch organist Ton Koopman, who said he was proud to be able to perform them for the first time in 320 years. He said the pieces were \"of a very high quality\" and would be \"a great asset for organists today, as they are also suitable for smaller organs\".They are believed to have been composed early in Bach's career, when he was working as an organ teacher in the town of Arnstadt in Thuringia.Mr Wollny, who is now the director of the Bach Archive in Leipzig, said they displayed several characteristics unique to the composer.\"Stylistically, the works also contain features that can be found in Bach's works from this period, but not in those of any other composer,\" he said.They are believed to have been written down in 1705 by one of Bach's pupils, Salomon Günther John.At a presentation of the works, Mr Wollny said he was \"99.99% sure that Bach had written the two pieces\" and they have now been added to the official catalogue of his works.",

    "body": "A US federal judge says \"investigative missteps\" and \"government misconduct\" may have tainted the Trump administration's criminal case against former FBI director James Comey.In a 24-page opinion, Judge William Fitzpatrick ordered justice department lawyers to release grand jury materials,  including transcripts and evidence, to Comey's defence team. The justice department has appealed against the order.Comey was charged in September after President Donald Trump called for his prosecution and appointed a new federal prosecutor to pursue the case. Comey, who has long drawn Trump's  ire, has pleaded not guilty to the charges, which include obstructing a congressional investigation.The former FBI chief was fired by Trump during his first term, after Comey led an investigation into Russian election interference in the 2016 US presidential election. Since then, Comey has been a frequent target of the two-term US president.Comey was accused of lying to lawmakers during a congressional hearing in 2020 about his Russian election interference investigation.After other federal prosecutors had reportedly declined to pursue the case against Comey, citing lack of evidence, Trump tapped Lindsey Halligan as the lead prosecutor in the case. She secured an indictment three days later.An indictment in the US justice system is a formal accusation issued by a grand jury - a group of citizens who examine the merits of evidence - to determine if a case should proceed.Comey was formally charged in October in a federal court in Virginia where he  pleaded not guilty. His defence team has not only taken issue with the legality of Halligan's quick appointment to the role of interim US attorney, a process by which she circumvented congressional approval, but also filed motions over how she brought the Comey indictment. On Monday, Judge Fitzpatrick wrote that he identified at least two statements Halligan made to grand jurors that could be seen as \"fundamental misstatements of the law that could compromise the integrity of the grand jury process\". One statement Halligan made, the judge noted, \"suggests\" that grand jury \"did not have to rely on only the record before them\", and that there was \"more evidence - perhaps better evidence\" that the government had that would be used at trial.In granting Comey's defence team access to all grand jury materials, Judge Fitzpatrick has also ordered the justice department to hand over complete audio recordings of the proceedings.\"The court recognizes this is an extraordinary remedy,\" Judge Fitzpatrick said.He continued: \"Under these unique circumstances (it) is necessary to fully protect the rights of the accused.\" ",

    "body": "Ex-Harvard president Larry Summers steps back from public role after Epstein email releaseFormer Harvard University President Larry Summers said he will step back from public commitments after his emails with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein were made public. \"I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein,\" Summers said in a statement obtained by the BBC's US partner, CBS News on Monday.In emails released by Congress last week, Summers, a former US treasury secretary, communicated with Epstein until the day before Epstein's 2019 arrest for sex trafficking minors. On Tuesday, House members are expected to vote on releasing all files related to Epstein. The move comes after the US Department of Justice announced that it would investigate Epstein's  \"involvement and relationship\" with former President Bill Clinton, who was also a friend of Epstein, and several other prominent Democrats.The justice department's decision comes after urging from Trump, who also asked for Summers, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and banks JP Morgan and Chase, to be investigated.\"Epstein was a Democrat, and he is the Democrat's problem, not the Republican's problem!\" he wrote on social media.\"They all know about him, don't waste your time with Trump. I have a Country to run!\"Clinton has strongly denied he had any knowledge of Epstein's crimes. Summers served as treasury secretary under Clinton and director of the National Economic Council under former President Barack Obama. He was president of Harvard from 2001 to 2006 and is currently a professor there. In Summers' statement on Monday night, he said he wanted \"to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me\".\"While continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort,\" he said.The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington where Summers was a senior fellow, announced on its website on Monday that he is no longer affiliated with the center.   The emails released by the House Oversight Committee last week indicate that Summers and Epstein met for dinner frequently, with Epstein often trying to connect Summers to prominent global figures. At one point, in July 2018, Epstein proposed a meeting with the \"president [sic] of united nations, interesting person for you\".In a separate email just after US President Trump's first election in 2016, Summers told Epstein to \"spend zero effort on anything about me with Trump\".Due to Trump's \"approach to conflict of interest\", Putin \"proximity\", and \"mindless response\" to Cuban leader Fidel Castro's death, Summers said he was \"best off a million miles away\".A representative for Summers previously told US media that he \"deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein after his conviction\" in 2008 for soliciting an underage prostitute.The emails include many high-profile figures. A review by The Wall Street Journal found that Trump was mentioned in more than 1,600 of the 2,324 email threads.Trump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. While he was discussed in some  messages released last week, he did not send or receive them.",

    "body": "A South African man who was seen attending a neo-Nazi rally outside an Australian state parliament has had his visa revoked.Matthew Gruter, who has been in Australia since 2022, took part in an anti-Jewish protest outside the New South Wales parliament organised by the National Socialist Network earlier this month.He was seen among around 60 men clad in black, who held up a banner that said \"Abolish the Jewish lobby\", Australian media report.Australia has seen a recent rise in right-wing extremism. Its government made the Nazi salute punishable by a mandatory prison term earlier this year.Australia's Home Affairs Minister, Tony Burke, confirmed the cancellation of Mr Gruter's visa, saying: \"If you are on a visa, you are a guest.\"If you're a citizen, you're a full member of the Australian family. Like with any household, if a guest turns up to show hatred and wreck the household, they can be told it's time to go home.\"Mr Gruter moved to Australia with his wife and works as a civil engineer, according to ABC News. The National Socialist Network, which organised the rally on 8 November, is a well-known neo-Nazi group in Australia. Mr Gruter is a senior member of the group in New South Wales, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.Demonstrators repeatedly chanted \"blood and honour\", a slogan associated with the Hitler Youth, according to ABC News.New South Wales Premier Chris Minns described the rally, which lasted about 20 minutes, as a \"shocking display of hatred and racism and antisemitism\".Sarah Schwartz, executive officer of the Jewish Council of Australia, told ABC News neo-Nazi groups were a threat to multiculturalism in the country and there needed to be a distinction between peaceful protests and \"hateful stunts\".\"They're acts of hate speech, and they should be considered as such,\" she added.",

    "body": "2 hours agoNada Tawfik,North America correspondent and Dearbail JordanThe UN Security Council has voted in favour of a US-drafted resolution that endorses US President Donald Trump's 20-point plan for Gaza.Included in the plan is the establishment of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF), to which, the US says, multiple unnamed countries have offered to contribute. The resolution was backed by 13 countries - including the UK, France and Somalia - with none voting against the proposal. Russia and China abstained.  Adopting it was an \"important step in the consolidation of the ceasefire,\" a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. Hamas has rejected the resolution, saying it fails to meet Palestinians' rights and demands. Writing on Telegram after the resolution passed, Hamas said the plan, \"imposes an international guardianship mechanism on the Gaza Strip, which our people and their factions reject\".\"Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation,\" it added.Under the resolution, the ISF will work with Israel and Egypt, along with a newly trained and vetted Palestinian police force, to help secure border areas and ensure the process of permanently disarming non-state armed groups, including Hamas.Until now, the police there have operated under the authority of Hamas.Mike Waltz, the US's ambassador to the UN, told the Council that the ISF would be \"tasked with securing the area, supporting the demilitarization of Gaza, dismantling the terrorist infrastructure, removing weapons, and ensuring the safety of Palestinian civilians\".The Security Council also approved the creation of a transitional governance body called the Board of Peace (BoP), which would supervise governance of a Palestinian technocratic, apolitical committee and oversee the reconstruction of Gaza and the delivery of humanitarian aid.Financing for reconstruction of Gaza following two years of war would come from a trust fund backed by the World Bank, according to the resolution. Under the resolution, both the ISF and the BoP would work alongside a Palestinian committee and police force.Trump called the Security Council vote \"historic\" and said it was a way of \"acknowledging and endorsing\" the BoP, with its final membership to be announced soon. He is expected to chair it. \"This will go down as one of the biggest approvals in the History of the United Nations, will lead to further Peace all over the World, and is a moment of true Historic proportion!\" he wrote on his Truth Social platform.Unlike earlier drafts, the resolution references a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood. It is language several council members pushed for.Israel strongly opposes the creation of a Palestinian state, a significant hurdle in the path to future statehood. Key Arab states had pressured drafters of the resolution to include Palestinian self-determination in the text.The UN Secretary-General's spokesperson stressed that the resolution needed to \"translate... into concrete and urgently needed steps on the ground\" and lead to \"a political process for the achievement of the two-State solution\". The US, the Palestinian Authority, and several Arab and Muslim-majority nations including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have called for the quick adoption of the resolution.The Palestinian Authority (PA) said in a statement that the resolution's terms needed to be implemented \"urgently and immediately\".Russia and China did not exercise their vetoes, but abstained to allow the resolution to pass, largely because the PA and eight other Arab and Muslim nations backed it.Both Moscow and Beijing criticised the resolution. They said there was little clarity about the key mechanisms' composition, that it did not ensure the participation of the UN, and that it failed to explicitly reiterate a firm commitment to the two-state solution.The initial phase of the plan - a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the handing over of hostages and detainees - came into force on 10 October. Waltz described it as a \"fragile, fragile first step\".Trump's peace plan in effect suspended the fighting between Israel and Hamas which had raged since Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in that attack.More than 69,483 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "3 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporterReutersCanada's parliament has narrowly approved Prime Minister Mark Carney's first federal budget, allowing his minority Liberal government to avert an early election. The fiscal plan, which raises Canada's deficit to a projected C$78 bn ($55.3 bn; £42.47 bn), was passed thanks to crucial support from opposition MPs, including Green Party leader Elizabeth May. Many opposition lawmakers have sharply criticised the fiscal plan - the second largest in history. The plan passed with 170 votes in favour and 168 against it. Carney, who served as the former central banker for both Canada and the UK, has defended the budget as a \"generational investment\" to help Canada strengthen its economy.The vote was crucial for Carney's Liberal government, which currently sits two seats short of a majority.It meant that if all 169 Liberal MPs voted in support, the budget would need the backing from either two opposition MPs, or have four opposition MPs abstain.Two NDP MPs abstained along with House Speaker Francis Scarpaleggia, who  casts a vote in the event of a tie. Conservative MPs Shannon Stubbs and Matt Jeneroux  - who announced earlier this month that he was resigning - also abstained.Green Party leader Elizabeth May's support also proved crucial. May told reporters she voted yes based on commitments made by Carney that he would support Canada's climate targets.\"Without what I heard from the Prime Minister today, I would have voted no,\" she said.Six takeaways from Canada's federal budgetThe Conservative Party, led by Pierre Poilievre, and the Quebec nationalist Bloc Québécois both voted against the budget, accusing Carney's government of failing to address affordability concerns. Poilievre labelled the budget a \"credit card budget\", arguing it does little to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.\"The Prime Minister's costly deficit gambles our future on the national credit card,\" Poilievre said in the House of Commons on Monday ahead of the vote.Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, who supported the budget, raised concerns of his own, suggesting that while the plan offered much-needed investment, it fell short in addressing Canada's housing crisis and stalled progress on climate action.Getty ImagesGreen Party leader Elizabeth May told reporters she would support the budget after getting assurances from him on Canada's climate targetsThe budget proposes C$140bn of new spending over the next five years \"to strengthen Canada's productivity, competitiveness, and resilience\".It includes money to update ports and other trade infrastructure with the goal of doubling Canadian exports to non-US markets over the next decade.Additionally, the plan allocates direct support for businesses hurt by US tariffs on Canadian goods, with Carney's government projecting the initiatives will attract C$1 trillion in private sector investment over the next five years.To balance the fiscal plan, Carney has proposed cutting the federal workforce by 10% over the coming years - a move that has drawn strong criticism from public sector employees, who cautioned that a leaner federal workforce would slow government operations.The budget was first put forward in early November, and has already survived two votes.Canada's Carney welcomes MP who defected to the LiberalsConservatives accuse Carney of being 'undemocratic' as MP resignsDebate around it had been partially eclipsed by partisan drama between Carney's Liberals and the Conservative opposition, who lost a member of their caucus to the Liberals shortly after the fiscal plan was proposed.Chris d'Entremont of Nova Scotia said he defected over what he believed was Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre's \"negative\" style of politics. He added that the Liberal budget \"hits the priorities\" of his constituents. Another Conservative lawmaker, Matt Jeneroux of Alberta, later resigned from parliament that same week, saying he did so to spend more time with family.The departures fuelled questions about Poilievre's leadership. On Wednesday, he told reporters that he plans to stay on as leader.\"My plan is to continue to lead and be the only leader that's fighting for an affordable Canada where our people who work hard can afford a home and food,\" Poilievre said.

    "body": "10 hours agoKhanyisile NgcoboJohannesburgSouth Africa has said it does not want to receive any more chartered flights carrying Palestinians, days after the controversial arrival of 153 passengers from Gaza in the country.Many aspects of their arrival remain unclear and disputed.The flight was part of \"a clear agenda to cleanse Palestinians out of Gaza and the West Bank\", Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola said on Monday.The Israeli authorities have not responded to this allegation. However, they said that South Africa had previously agreed to receive the 153 Palestinians.The BBC has asked the South African authorities to comment.The Palestinian embassy in South Africa has said the group left Israel's Ramon Airport and flew to the country via the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, \"without any prior note or coordination\".It said that \"an unregistered and misleading organization\" had exploited the plight of the Gaza citizens, \"deceived families, collected money from them, and facilitated their travel in an irregular and irresponsible manner\".The Palestinian foreign ministry went on to say, through the embassy, that it was working with South Africa to \"address this situation resulting from this lapse\".The flight at the centre of the dispute arrived on Thursday, at South Africa's OR Tambo International Airport.The passengers were initially refused entry into the country and were stuck on the plane for more than 10 hours.Authorities in South Africa, which has strongly supported the Palestinian cause during the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, said this was because the passengers did not have departure stamps in their passports. Palestinians are allowed to travel to South Africa for 90 days without a visa.Eventually, the group was allowed to disembark after intervention from a local charity. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said this was out of \"empathy [and] compassion\". Twenty-three of the passengers had already taken flights elsewhere so 130 were allowed into the country, South African authorities said.During a media briefing about South Africa's readiness to host the G20 Leaders' Summit, taking place this weekend, Lamola said Thursday's flight looked like it was part of a \"broader agenda to remove Palestinians from Palestine into many different parts of the world\".\"[This] is a clearly orchestrated operation because they are not only being sent to South Africa. There are other countries where such flights have been sent,\" he said, without giving any details. He added that the matter was being investigated.Two weeks ago, another plane carrying 176 Palestinians landed in Johannesburg, with some of the passengers proceeding to other countries, according to the local Gift of the Givers charity that is assisting the arrivals. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly spoken about resettling Palestinians from Gaza \"voluntarily\" - a move that has been criticised by Palestinians, human rights groups and many in the international community.Speaking a day after the flight arrived, South Africa's president said the Palestinians \"somehow mysteriously were put on a plane that passed by Nairobi\" and flew to South Africa, according to local online publication News24.Israeli military body Cogat, which controls Gaza's crossings, said in a statement: \"The residents left the Gaza Strip after Cogat received approval from a third country to receive them.\" It did not specify the country at the time.Cogat on Monday named South Africa as the third country that had agreed to receive the Palestinians.South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza.The country's sympathy for the Palestinian fight for an independent state goes back decades, particularly the early 1990s when anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela pledged support for the Palestinian cause.Large pro-Palestinian marches have been held around South Africa since the conflict began.Smaller pro-Israel marches and rallies have been held in the country, which hosts the largest Jewish community in sub-Saharan Africa.In 2023, the South African government filed a case against Israel with the International Court of Justice, accusing it of genocide in Gaza. Israel has strongly rejected the South African claim, calling it \"baseless\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoChi Chi Izundu & Rebecca ThornBBC Global WomenBBCArden Cho stars as the voice of Rumi in KPop Demon Hunters, which topped Netflix charts in 93 countriesThis is part of the Global Women series from the BBC World Service, sharing extraordinary interviews and stories from around the globe.  \"I hated that I looked Asian, that I didn't have blue eyes and blonde hair, because that's what was beautiful at the time,\" says Arden Cho, the actress who voiced Rumi, star of Netflix's chart-topping animated film, KPop Demon Hunters.Cho, 40, is describing her childhood in Texas, as the eldest daughter of Korean immigrant parents and her struggle for acceptance in American society.In the film, which tells the story of a female K-Pop trio who must save the world from evil forces, Rumi has to come to terms with her identity as part human, part demon - and when Cho first read the script this resonated powerfully.\"Being born in America, feeling American but having people treat me like I'm not, trying to figure out my identity as an Asian-American, as a Korean-American, as a woman,\" she says.These were all elements of her early life that mirrored Rumi's journey.\"I can honestly say that at different points in my life, I hated a lot of myself and I wanted to be someone else.\"As kids, what you see shapes who you become and I feel like I just didn't see enough people that look like me.\"NetflixCho says the film has led to \"Korea being loved\" more than ever beforeWhen it launched on Netflix in June, KPop Demon Hunters registered 33 million views in just two weeks, and reached the top 10 of the Netflix charts in 93 countries. To star in the first Hollywood animated film set in Korea, with Korean leads, was for Cho \"a dream come true\" – but it has also made her a powerful role model for Asian-American children, of the kind that she lacked when she was young.Cho says many Korean-Americans have told her it's \"such a refreshing moment\", making them proud for the first time of their dual heritage and culture.\"I feel like K-Pop really, truly, has paved the way. K-beauty has had such a big impact on Korea being loved. But I feel like this movie is the one that tipped it over the edge of, everybody wants to go to Korea, now,\" Cho says.But the film's success was not guaranteed and Cho says she felt the team making it were \"sometimes facing an uphill battle\".\"I feel like it kind of sucks to say this, but any time there's an Asian-led project, people feel like it's a risk,\" she says.So, when she took on the role, she made an effort to meet everyone working on the film in person, she says.Cho says she thinks racism stems from poor educationThe film was released against the backdrop of increased immigration raids in the US as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation effort, which sparked protests in many states.As an Asian-American living in the US \"it's heartbreaking and disappointing,\" says Cho. \"Immigrants have made America what it is.\"Korean news sources have estimated that up to 150,000 Korean immigrants without proper documentation, including adopted children, are among those who could be deported.As an adult, Cho came to realise that the racism she had experienced when she was younger stemmed mainly from a lack of education, as people didn't know what it meant to be Korean or Asian.\"But now in this day and age, when I feel like the world and people should know better, it is beyond disappointing and sometimes I feel like we feel so hopeless,\" she says.Because of this, it feels very special, she says, that KPop Demon Hunters could bring \"hope and joy and love to all these different communities\".\"Maybe that's why it's sort of like this movie of the summer, because we just needed some hope and something to unite us all together.\"Getty ImagesJi-Young Yoo (left) and May Hong (right) are also voice actors in the filmThe growth of AI is a major concern for the film industry, raising the possibility that in future it could be used to make a film like KPop Demon Hunters.Cho says she is aware that AI is already being used to replicate actors' voices, but wants to \"have hope in humanity\" that people will still seek out art created by humans.\"Sure, I'm sure they're going to have AI actors and singers. I know they already exist. I know our voices are already being manipulated, but I hope people have some respect and want and love for something real.\"KPop Demon Hunters has also been dominating the global music charts, with seven tracks from its soundtrack featured on the Billboard Hot 100. It has its own fan art, and audiences around the world are demanding a sequel.Cho tells us she wishes she could answer the question of whether that will happen - but both she and fans will have to wait for Netflix or Sony Pictures Entertainment, which made the film, to give it the green light.\"I know there's lots of murmurs, I've heard wonderful things,\" she says. \"So we shall see, and I think everyone in the world would riot if there wasn't.\"Starting conversations, building connections and challenging misinformation through features, investigations, interviews and extraordinary stories",

    "body": "9 hours agoJaroslav Lukiv and James Watershouse,Ukraine correspondent in BrusselsUkraine will get up to 100 of France's Rafale F4  fighter jets as well as advanced air defence systems in a major deal to boost Kyiv's ability to protect itself against deadly Russian attacks.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the move as \"historic\", after signing the letter of intent with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron at an air base near Paris.Deliveries of the Rafale F4's are planned to be completed by 2035, while the joint production of interceptor drones is starting this year.Financial details are yet to be worked out, but reports say France plans to attract EU financing and also access frozen Russian assets - a controversial move that has split the 27-member bloc.\"This is a strategic agreement which will last for 10 years starting from the next year,\" Zelensky said at a joint briefing with Macron on Monday.Ukraine would also get \"very strong French radars\", eight air defence systems and other advanced weaponry, he added.Zelensky stressed that using such advanced systems \"means protecting someone's life... this is very important\".Russia has in recent months increased its drone and missile attacks against Ukraine, targeting energy and rail infrastructure and causing massive blackouts across the country. Dozens of civilians have been killed in the strikes, in what Kyiv and its Western allies describe as war crimes. In the latest overnight Russian missile attack, three people were killed and 15 injured, in the north-eastern Ukrainian city of Balakliya, local officials said.Speaking alongside Zelensky, Macron said: \"We're planning Rafales, 100 Rafales - that's huge. That's what's needed for the regeneration of the Ukrainian military\".The French president added that he wanted to help Ukraine prepare for whatever was coming next.These Rafale fighter jets are seen as crucial to protecting Ukraine's skies, because the country is almost powerless in preventing long-range air strikes on its border towns and cities.\"The Russians are using 6000 glide bombs per month,\" Serhiy Kuzhan, a Ukrainian defence analyst, told the BBC. \"It would be important to have a French air to air system, with a 200km range, because Russians have their own system with a range of 230km.\"While this announcement between Kyiv and Paris is sizeable, Justin Bronk from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) points out: \"The difference they'll make will depend on the timeframe and the missiles that come with them\".This is a long-term political agreement, rather than a detailed purchase order, so few are expecting this announcement to dramatically change the dynamics of Russia's grinding invasion.The promises of Western military hardware are only as effective as the training and logistics they come with. Whether it's a German-made Leopard 2 Tank or an American F-16 fighter jet, they all require intensive training, sizable support crews and a lot of spare parts.With the Rafales, further complexities arise around the question of who pays. It's thought France will dip into its own budget contributions for Kyiv, as well as look as joint EU borrowing mechanisms to help pay for the deal.But what you hear privately admitted in EU's corridors of power in Brussels, is that the money is slowing running out.The bloc has agreed to help support Ukraine's battered economy for the next two years, but there is less consensus on whether to unlock €140bn ($162bn; £123bn) of frozen Russian assets to help support Ukraine financially and militarily.The proposals are currently illegal under international law, and some members are nervous about the prospect of having to pay Russia back when the war ends.Ukraine's air force is already using France's Mirage warplanes as well as US-made F-16s. Kyiv has also recently provisionally agreed to obtain Sweden's Gripen fighter jets.After France, Zelensky will travel to Spain to seek further military and other support for Ukraine. Over the weekend, he secured a gas deal with Greece. Vital supplies of US liquefied natural gas are now expected to start flowing into Ukraine this winter via a pipeline across the Balkans.Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukraine's territory and Russian troops have been making slow advances along the vast front line - despite reported huge combat casualties.",

    "body": "11 hours agoPaulin KolaReutersThe Louvre museum in Paris has announced it is closing one of its galleries because of structural weaknesses.The Campana Gallery - consisting of nine rooms which host Greek ceramics - will remain shut as engineers investigate \"certain beams supporting the floors\", the Louvre said.The announcement adds to the museum's unwelcome attention following a high-profile heist last month in which jewels worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken.Criticism has focused on lax security at the world's most-visited museum in the French capital.Four people have been arrested over the heist, but the jewels have not been recovered.In a statement on Monday, the Louvre said that structural issues in offices on the second floor - above the Campana Gallery in the Sully wing of the museum - had led to its decision.\"During these investigations, the Campana Gallery... will be closed to the public as a precautionary measure,\" it said.Three weeks after the jewel theft, a report was released in which the Court of Auditors criticised managers who had preferred to invest in new artworks and exhibitions rather than basic upkeep and protection of the museum.Basing its findings on the years 2018-24, the report found the museum had spent €105.4m (£92.7m) on buying new artworks and €63.5m on exhibition spaces.But at the same time it spent only €26.7m on maintenance works, and €59.5m on restoration of the palace building.Watch: Two people leave Louvre in lift mounted to vehicleOn the day of the heist, the suspects arrived at 09:30 (07:30 GMT), just after the museum opened to visitors.The suspects arrived with a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine. The men used a disc cutter to crack open display cases housing the jewellery.Prosecutors said the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38, before switching to cars.One of the stolen items - a crown - was dropped during the escape. The other seven jewels have not been found.The fear is that they have already been spirited abroad, though the prosecutor in charge of the case has said she is still hopeful they can be retrieved intact.Those arrested over the heist that shocked France were all petty criminals rather than organised crime professionals, Paris's prosecutor has said.Since the incident, security measures have been tightened around France's cultural institutions.The Louvre has even transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France.Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen A tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was taken",

    "body": "19 hours agoPeter Mwai & Richard Irvine-BrownBBC Verify    Getty ImagesWarning: This story contains graphic descriptions of violence and gunshot injuries.A crowd runs in panic along a dusty street. Shots ring out. A woman wearing a purple jacket carrying a stick falls to the ground.Another woman can be heard pleading, \"Mama, mama, stand,\" as she tries to lift her. Blood is spreading around her stomach as another stain appears on her back.This verified footage, filmed in Tanzania's city of Arusha, is just one of many graphic scenes to have emerged showing the violent actions of police as they attempted to crush widespread protests last month during the country's presidential and parliamentary elections.The protests started in the city of Dar es Salaam on 29 October and spread across the country over the following days. The demonstrations had largely been organised by young people left angry at what they see as a political system dominated by one party since Tanzania gained independence in the 1960s.Several opposition leaders were arrested and others banned from standing during the elections while a number of opposition activists were detained. Incumbent President Samia Suluhu Hassan ultimately secured victory after the electoral commission declared she received 98% of the vote.Since then the UN human rights office (OHCHR) said it had reports indicating that hundreds of people were killed during the protests, with many more injured or detained. A diplomatic source in Tanzania told the BBC there was credible evidence that at least 500 people had died.President Samia has called for an official investigation into the unrest and asked prosecutors to \"show leniency\" towards those arrested.Footage of the protests was suppressed for almost a week when the government imposed a near-total internet blackout and threatened to jail anyone caught sharing any videos from the protests, saying it could cause unrest. Only once the block was lifted on 4 November did dozens of videos begin to emerge online showing violent scenes: uniformed officers appearing to fire at crowds, bodies lying on the streets, with others piled up outside a hospital.To understand what happened, BBC Verify has analysed, geolocated and confirmed footage, building a clearer picture of how police responded to the demonstrations.Violence in Tanzania's largest cityIn the footage our team has verified the protests appear to have been dominated by groups of young men, drawing strong parallels with a global Gen-Z youth movement frustrated at economic decline and entrenched leadership in countries across Africa.The first demonstrations we identified took place early on election day in Dar es Salaam, the country's largest city and economic hub. They spread to other urban areas across the country, including the cities of Mwanza and Arusha.The internet blackout makes it difficult to establish a clear sequence of events, but what is clear from videos and images posted online is that protesters were confronted by heavily armed police units blocking their progress and firing tear gas to disperse crowds. In many of the videos, gunfire can clearly be heard as people scatter in the ensuing chaos.ReutersPolice used tear gas to disperse crowdsA key flashpoint was along the Morogoro Road, a main highway through Dar es Salaam. In two separate highly graphic videos, two bodies can be seen lying on the side road next to St Andrew's Anglican Church. One lies unresponsive, with heavy wounds visible on their head, surrounded by a pool of blood.We identified more bodies lying nearby around the same stretch of road: one next to a bus stop and two more on the ground surrounded by blood. One body is later seen wrapped in a white shroud.Further casualties are also visible along this stretch of highway and in the neighbouring side streets.Footage from another location close to the Open University of Tanzania shows a motionless body on the ground with an open head wound. In a later video taken from the same scene we see the body covered in a cloth and carried towards a group of policemen standing by the university building.\"Killers, killers,\" the group chants at the officers, one of whom is armed with a rifle, another carries a pistol. The body is then placed in the back of a truck.BBC Verify has confirmed at least a dozen other videos from Dar es Salaam showing people with a range of injuries, some of whom are being carried away.ReutersWe have also documented casualties from protests more than 700 miles (1125km) away in Tanzania's second-largest city, Mwanza, that took place on election day.Within the grounds of the city's Sekou Toure Hospital, several videos show a pile of 10 bodies, all of whom appear to be young men. Some of them have visible open wounds. Other footage from within the hospital shows bodies laid out in what appears to be a hospital morgue.Footage shows police firing on crowdsWe have verified multiple videos of police shooting towards groups of protesters.In three videos posted online, police vehicles are seen chasing dozens of people as the attempt to flee along Nelson Mandela Road in Dar es Salaam. Several rounds of gunfire can be heard as the police advance.DouyinArmed police chase fleeing protesters in Dar es Salaam as shots ring outIn Arusha, footage shows a police vehicle passing a crowd of chanting youths. Gunshots ring out and people are seen scattering and running for safety. Another video taken shows an injured man with those around him saying he's been shot.In the northern Kijitonyama area of Dar es Salaam, two men in uniform were filmed taking aim and firing along a main road in the direction of protests. We have confirmed the location next to a local school. The green uniforms and flat-topped peak caps worn by the two men closely match those worn by the Tanzanian police.XMen in police uniform take aim towards protestersLess than 100 metres away a man is shown lying on the street with a bloody head wound. In the distance, men wearing similar green uniforms can be seen. Someone shouts: \"He has been shot in the head. They have killed [him].\" As the video continues, more gunshots can be heard.There are also multiple videos seen by BBC Verify of men in the same green uniforms firing weapons - sometimes into the air, sometimes along open streets.Investigators from audio forensics experts, Earshot, said what can be heard in those videos confirms live rounds were used on protesters.After analysing the audio from the scene, they said: \"Rubber bullets typically do not travel at supersonic speeds.\"The presence of these shockwaves therefore indicates the use of live rounds.\"Not all the people we've seen carrying guns are wearing uniforms. In footage filmed in Sam Nujoma Road, Dar es Salaam, three men in civilian clothing are seen firing guns by a saloon car. It's unclear who they are. TikTokThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, has called for an investigation into the killings and other violations committed during Tanzania's elections, and for the unconditional release of all those arrested before the vote took place and others who have since been detained.The Tanzanian government and police have been contacted for comment.",

    "body": "23 minutes agoYolande Knell,Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem and Wahiba Ahmed,JerusalemBBCChildren and families will perish, warns Jan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee CouncilAid agencies have reiterated calls for Israel to allow more tents and urgently needed supplies into Gaza after the first heavy winter rainfall, saying more than a quarter of a million families need emergency help with shelters.\"We are going to lose lives this winter. Children, families will perish,\" says Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC).\"It's actually so frustrating that we've now lost so many crucial weeks since the adoption of the Trump peace plan, which said humanitarian aid would flow and the Palestinians would not needlessly continue to suffer.\"With a majority of the population displaced by two-years of a devastating war, most Gazans now live in tents - many of them makeshift.  They have been clearing up after widespread flooding due to a winter storm that began on Friday. There are fears that diseases could spread as rainwater has mixed with sewage water.\"My children are already sick and look at what happened to our tent,\" said Fatima Hamdona, crying in the rain over the weekend, as she showed a BBC freelance journalist the ankle-deep puddle inside her temporary home in Gaza City.\"We don't have food - the flour got all wet.  We're people who've been destroyed.  Where do we go? There's no shelter for us to go to now.\"Fatima Hamdona (pictured) says her family's food perished in the rainThe story was the same in the southern city of Khan Younis.\"Our clothes, mattresses and blankets were flooded,\" said Nihad Shabat, as she tried to dry out her possessions there on Monday.  Her family has been sleeping inside a shelter made of sheets and blankets.  \"We're worried about getting flooded again. We cannot afford to buy a tent.\"A recent UN report found that across Gaza more than 80% of buildings had been destroyed and 92% in Gaza City.According to the NRC - which has long led the so-called Shelter Cluster in Gaza, made up of some 20 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) - about 260,000 Palestinian families, or about 1.5 million people, are in need of emergency shelter assistance, lacking the basics to get through winter.The NGOs say they have been able to get only about 19,000 tents into Gaza since the US-brokered Israel-Hamas ceasefire took effect on 10 October.  They say they have 44,000 pallets of aid - containing non-food items, including tents and bedding - blocked from entering.  Supplies that have been bought are currently stuck in Egypt, Jordan and Israel.Jan Egeland blames what he calls \"a bureaucratic, military, politicised quagmire\" running \"counter to all humanitarian principles\" for the hold-up. In March, Israel introduced a new registration process for aid groups working in Gaza, citing security reasons.  It requires that they give lists of their local Palestinian staff.  However, aid groups say that data protection laws in donor countries prevent them from handing over such information.Many tents have fallen to pieces, leaving displaced Palestinians without proper shelterMany items, including tent poles, are also classed as \"dual-use\" by Israel, meaning they have a military as well as civilian purpose, and their entry is banned or heavily restricted.Cogat, the Israeli defence body that controls the border crossings, told the BBC that \"over the last few months\" it had coordinated the entry of \"close to 190,000 tents and tarpaulins directly to the residents of the Gaza Strip\". It said that \"in accordance with the terms of the agreement\" of the ceasefire, it was allowing \"hundreds of trucks carrying food, water, fuel, gas, medicines, medical equipment, tents, and shelter supplies [to] enter the Gaza Strip every day, in coordination with the UN, international organizations, donor countries, and the private sector\". On Sunday, Cogat wrote on X: \"We call on international organizations to coordinate more tents and tarpaulins and other winter humanitarian responses.\"It said it was working with the new US-led Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) that had been set up in southern Israel and other international partners to plan \"a catered humanitarian response for the upcoming winter\".International aid groups are hoping that the CMCC - which will oversee implementation of President Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan - will help ease restrictions on their work.With a foreign donor conference on reconstruction in the Palestinian territory expected to take place in Egypt soon, they say basic shelter supplies must be allowed to enter while longer-term plans are developed.\"It would not be a good thing if all these nations meet in Cairo to discuss long-term reconstruction for Palestinians in great need if they die before their high-rise buildings can be reconstructed,\" says Mr Egeland, who was previously the UN's Emergency Relief Coordinator.  \"They need a tent today, they don't need a promise of a beachfront structure in five years.\"Displaced Palestinians have nowhere else to go after so much of Gaza was devastated in the warPalestinians have told the BBC that many tents - brought in by international agencies and Gulf donors - have been stolen and are available on the black market in Gaza.They say that with a small increase in supply, prices have dropped from about $2,700 (2,330 euros; £2,050) before the ceasefire, to around $900-$1,000.There are pleas for international help to distribute more shelters, more fairly.\"I hope everyone will join with us to end this crisis we're living through,\" says Alaa al-Dirghali in Khan Younis.  \"The tents endured two years under the sun and two years under the rain and they couldn't last this downpour.\"\"Until this moment, people are re-erecting these broken tents because they don't have any alternative.  I pray to God that those responsible for handing out tents will give them to those who actually need them.  They're getting stolen and sold to people at a very expensive price.\"\"When the rain came, the tents couldn't protect us,\" says Rami Deif AllahIn Gaza City, Rami Deif Allah, who was displaced from Beit Hanoun, was drying out soaked mattresses in the weak sunshine, with his elderly mother and children.He said a relative had given him a waterproof tent but that it was still flooded.\"We evacuated about 11 times and there was no safe place for us so we took shelter in these humble tents but it was all in vain. When the rain came they couldn't protect us,\" he said. \"The water flooded us from above and below.\"Like all Gazans, Rami longs for a permanent dwelling.\"We pray for this war to be fully over, and for everyone to return to their homes,\" he went on.  \"Even if we don't find our houses standing, with our sweat and blood we will rebuild. This situation of living out on the streets is unbearable.\"",

    "body": "The US will help South Korea build nuclear 'attack' submarines - here's what that means2 days agoJake Kwon,Seoul and Gavin Butler,SingaporeGetty ImagesA file photo of the USS Kentucky nuclear submarine during a visit to South KoreaSouth Korea's government has announced that it has finalised an agreement to build nuclear-powered submarines in partnership with the United States.The US has approved the \"attack submarines\" and agreed to cooperate in sourcing fuel, according to a fact sheet released by the White House on Thursday.The agreement marks a significant step in South Korea's relations with the US and comes amid a period of growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula: with the nuclear-armed North Korea, and an expansionist China to the west.Here's what you need to know about the agreement. What's in the agreement? The agreement between the US and South Korea comes as leaders from both countries reached a broad trade deal earlier last month that would see reciprocal tariffs cut to 15% from 25%. US President Donald Trump had slapped a tariff rate on Seoul of 25% earlier this year - which his counterpart Lee Jae Myung managed to negotiate down to 15%, after Seoul said it would invest $350bn (£265bn) in the US, including $200bn in cash investment and $150bn in shipbuilding.In a White House readout released on Thursday, the US said it had \"given approval for the Republic of Korea to build nuclear-powered attack submarines... [and would] work closely to advance requirements for this project, including avenues to source fuel\".In an earlier post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump had said the vessels would be constructed at a shipyard in Philadelphia run by South Korean conglomerate Hanwha.Only six countries currently possess nuclear-powered strategic submarines: the US, China, Russia, the UK, France and India.South Korea already possesses about 20 submarines, but they are all diesel propelled and therefore need to surface far more frequently. Nuclear submarines are also able to operate further and faster.\"I have given them approval to build a nuclear-powered submarine, rather than the old-fashioned, and far less nimble, diesel-powered submarines that they have now,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.South Korea is a powerhouse when it comes to civilian nuclear energy. It had a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s but gave it up following US pressure. And so its ability to enrich or reprocess uranium is limited by the US as it is entirely dependent on imports. Why does South Korea want nuclear submarines? The latest vessel programme is aimed at countering North Korea, which recently revealed that it was pursuing its own nuclear submarine programme.President Lee had told Trump at the APEC summit last month that South Korea needed them for that express purpose.In a TV interview last week, Ahn Gyu-back, South Korea's Minister of Defence, said that nuclear submarines would be a \"proud achievement\" for South Korea, and a major leap in strengthening the country's defence against the North.The stealth of nuclear submarines would keep North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"awake at night\", he added. Getty ImagesUS President Donald Trump met his Korean counterpart in South Korea last monthDoes North Korea have nuclear submarines?North Korea has also been pursuing a nuclear submarine programme – possibly with Russia's help, according to South Korean officials.In March 2025, North Korea unveiled pictures of what it claimed was a nuclear-powered submarine that was under construction, showing Kim visiting the shipyard. Pyongyang is expected to have the submarines within the next few years.North Korea is also estimated to have an arsenal of approximately 50 nuclear weapons, as part of its broader nuclear weapons programme.Jo Bee-yun, a research fellow at the Sejong Institute, suggested that Seoul's acquisition of nuclear submarines will help it stay apace in East Asia's escalating arms race.\"North Korea's nuclear weapon is an established fact,\" she told the BBC. \"[South Korea acquiring] nuclear submarines is only a step in the larger trend of rising tension.\"Will this inflame tensions on the Korean Peninsula?It is unclear how much the nuclear-propelled submarines will contribute to South Korea's defence capabilities – and though they are very expensive, they don't quite change the balance of power on the Korean Peninsula, according to some experts.Yang Uk, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, told the BBC that the nuclear subs' primary purpose is to assure South Korean voters that their government is responding to North Korea's nuclear threat.\"South Korea cannot develop its own nuclear weapons to counter North Korea's,\" Dr Yang said. \"What's something that they can do? Fielding nuclear submarines.\"Dr Yang believes North Korea might revel in the change, however, because it reinforces their justification to hold on to nuclear weapons – meaning it will become more difficult to demand that Pyongyang give up its nuclear arsenal.Jo nonetheless emphasised the strategic advantage that South Korea stands to gain from the new submarine deal, describing it as a \"major change\" which \"means South Korea is now a regional player\". \"The best feature of a nuclear submarine is its speed,\" she said. \"It can now go fast and far and South Korea can operate together with more countries.\"What's in it for the United States?For Washington, support for South Korea's nuclear-powered submarine programme likely aims to put pressure on both North Korea and China.\"Trump has put the burden of defence spending on the back of South Korea,\" Dr Yang explained. \"South Korea will greatly expand its defence budget. They will act as America's proxy in putting pressure on China and North Korea.\"Getty ImagesDonald Trump is attempting to counter the influence of other nations in South Korea, according to expertsUS and China have long competed for strategic influence in South Korea, leaving Seoul to walk a geopolitical tightrope. More recently, China has been increasing its naval activity near South Korea's maritime border – a move akin to those seen in the South China Sea.Beijing must be \"furious\" about South Korea's nuclear submarine agreement with the US, Dr Yang said.Following the deal's announcement, the Chinese Ambassador to South Korea, Dai Bing, said he hoped South Korea would \"deal with this issue prudently, taking into consideration the concerns of all sides\".Dai also added that Beijing was engaging with Seoul on the matter through diplomatic channels, and emphasised that \"the (security) situation on the Korean Peninsula and in the region is still complex and sensitive\".What next?Although President Trump said the submarines would be built in Philadelphia and bring jobs to the US, South Korean officials have maintained they must be built locally, where existing facilities can deliver them in a much shorter timeline.South Korea's Prime Minister Kim Min-seok had himself said during a parliamentary hearing that the South Korean owned shipyard in Philadelphia did \"not have the capability\" to build such vessels, according to reports. Hanwha, who owns the shipyard, has yet to comment on the matter. But now that an agreement has been reached, the next step is to adjust the nuclear agreement between the two countries, allowing for the US to provide nuclear fuel and to set the fence for its military use.",

    "body": "3 hours agoNikhil InamdarBBC News, MumbaiHindustan Times via Getty ImagesCash transfer announcements, especially directed towards women, have become popular ahead of electionsFreebies are powering election victories in India, but can its states afford them? Over the years, handouts have taken different forms in the hotly contested political landscape of the world's largest democracy. Voters have been lured with everything from television sets to bicycles and sometimes even gold ornaments - blurring the fine line between welfare economics and pre-poll populism.In recent years, cash transfers, especially directed towards women, have become a popular election-winning strategy for political parties of all stripes.A sweeping victory last week in the eastern state of Bihar - India's poorest state - for an alliance led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is being credited in part to a 10,000 rupee ($112; £85.18) cash handout to the state's women. A record number of women turned out to vote in the election.Similar women-oriented financial support schemes were launched by Modi's party in other states like Maharashtra ahead of polls last year. Opposition parties have also promised similar schemes in some states ahead of elections.Economists like Jean Drèze have argued in favour of such giveaways. He says that while distinguishing between \"useful\" and \"wasteful\" handouts is important, it is only by extracting promises during elections that the poor in India get anything at all from their political representatives.On the other hand, despite his party's own track record on the issue, Modi has in the past warned of the dangers of \"revdi culture\" - likening election giveaways to the frivolous distribution of sweets. India's top court had also sought to curb the distribution of such \"irrational freebies\" during elections back in 2023.While there is broad agreement on the need for targeted subsidies to challenge the use of handouts as electoral bait, Indian elections are increasingly dominated by unaffordable, poll-driven freebie economics that states can ill afford.Hindustan Times via Getty ImagesModi (right) with incumbent Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar ahead of the electionAccording to research from brokerage Emkay Global, Bihar is facing considerable fiscal pressure, with the deficit or gap between what the state earns and spends at 6% of its gross domestic product (GDP).Despite this, the state announced pre-election schemes amounting to 4% of GDP, more than its capital outlay - money that could have been spent in job-creating, long-term assets that would have aided the state's development. It is just one example in a litany of states practising indiscriminate election populism, according to Emkay Global.\"Even good [fiscally prudent] states are now in the grip of freebie economics,\" the brokerage said, as a result of which the 3% fiscal deficit to GDP ceiling that has been mandated for states, to curb non-budgeted spending, is now actually the floor.Some estimates suggest that 21 of India's 29 states have crossed this 3% deficit target, with disproportionate costs imposed by election-driven spending being one of the reasons.The fact that such populism is unsustainable is illustrated by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led alliance's Ladki Bahin (Beloved Sister) financial assistance scheme, which led to a 0.4% jump in Maharashtra state's deficit, according to Emkay Global. It forced the government to roll back some of the promises once the polls were over.India's central bank has also flagged the rising burden of such subsidies on state-level debt as a key emerging concern.According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), while overall debt of Indian states declined to about 28.5% of GDP by March 2024 compared with the levels seen over the past decade, it remains well above the 20% recommended threshold, with new pressures emerging in the form of an increasing subsidy burden.\"An area of incipient stress is the sharp rise in expenditure on subsidies, driven by farm loan waivers, free/subsidised services (like electricity to agriculture and households, transport, gas cylinder) and cash transfers to farmers, youth and women,\" the RBI said in its 2024-25 report on state finances.\"States need to contain and rationalise their subsidy outgoes, so that such spending does not crowd out more productive expenditure.\"Hindustan Times via Getty ImagesState governments have distributed free cycles to female students in the pastThis warning comes as the private sector continues to hold back on investment in new job-creating factories, and the government, forced to slow its own capital spending on infrastructure, turns instead to tax cuts and giveaways to spur middle-class consumption.But with freebies seeing such success in Bihar - and more state elections looming - that warning is unlikely to be heeded.\"This [Bihar] election outcome reinforces the freebie wave that has swept states in the last two years, and with Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and crucially, West Bengal going to polls next year, one can expect this race to the bottom to continue,\" Emkay Global economists Medhavi Arora and Harshal Patel said in their note.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

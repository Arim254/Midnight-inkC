    "body": "4 hours agoJaroslav LukivReutersThe bus fell into a three-metre-wide ice fissure on Lake Baikal on FridayRussian authorities say divers have recovered the bodies of seven Chinese tourists and a Russian driver who died after their mini-bus plunged under the ice to the bottom of Lake Baikal in Siberia. Irkutsk regional Governor Igor Kobzev offered his \"deepest condolences to the families and friends of the victims\". He earlier said one Chinese tourist had managed to escape. The depth at the site of Friday's accident was 18m (59ft), and the divers had to use underwater cameras to search for the bodies.Baikal - the world's deepest lake with a maximum depth of 1,642m (5,387ft) - is a popular tourist destination. It often freezes during harsh winters and has seen a number of deadly accidents over the years.The bus fell into three-metre-wide ice fissure on Friday, Kobzev said in a post on Telegram.\"I would like to remind you once again that going out onto Lake Baikal's ice is not just prohibited right now. It's mortally dangerous,\" the governor said, urging tourists to use only official tour operators.He added that all the Chinese tourists - including a 14-year-old child - had travelled independently. A criminal investigation into the cause of the tragedy is now under way.Shortly afterwards Kobzev took to social media again, saying that \"sadly, even this tragedy hasn't taught people a lesson\", informing that six people trapped in their cars had been rescued in two separate incidents on Friday and Saturday.In late January, a Chinese tourist died after a car he was travelling overturned on the frozen surface of Lake Baikal.",

    "body": "1 day agoJack BurgessReutersVenezuelan opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa has announced on social media that he has been freed after \"almost nine months of unjust imprisonment\". His comments come shortly after the country's interim President, Delcy Rodríguez, signed an amnesty bill approved by its National Assembly that could lead to the release of hundreds of political prisoners. Rodríguez's interim government has faced pressure from the US to speed up the release of Venezuela's remaining political prisoners after delays to the law. However, Guanipa described the bill as a \"flawed document\" that excludes many Venezuelans who remain \"unjustly\" behind bars. Guanipa is the leader of Venezuela's centre-right Justice First party and was a former vice-president of the National Assembly.Venezuela's socialist government has always denied holding political prisoners but first announced days after Maduro's capture, on 8 January, that \"a significant number\" of prisoners would be freed as a goodwill gesture.Opposition and human rights groups have said the government under Maduro for years used detentions of political prisoners to stamp out dissent and silence critics.Interim President Rodriguez has described the amnesty bill as being intended for the offering and receiving of forgiveness.Meanwhile, exiled opposition figurehead Edmundo González wrote on social media on Friday that there would be \"no lasting reconciliation without memory or responsibility\" in Venezuela. He added that a \"legitimate\" amnesty must come with \"truth, recognition and reparation\".Activists within the South American country have denounced delays to the amnesty law and a lack of transparency over who is being freed.",

Local authorities have been trying to step up efforts to get a grip on the issue by using methods such as surveillance cameras to catch culprits.\"Ingenuity can never become an alibi for incivility,\" the municipality of Catania said in a post on its official Facebook page.\"Respect for urban etiquette and the environment is everyone's duty,\" it added.The post did not say whether any action had been taken.",

    "body": "1 day agoRebecca Morelle,Science Editor,Alison Francis,Senior Science JournalistandGreg Brosnan,Senior Science JournalistShutterstockThe astronauts will begin their journey on Nasa's Space Launch System rocket Nasa is targeting early March to launch a crew around the Moon for the first time in more than 50 years, in what would be humankind's furthest trip into space.The Artemis II mission will see four astronauts embark on a 10-day journey around the far side of the Moon and back to Earth, paving the way for a future lunar landing.Nasa set the earliest launch date of March 6 (early on March 7 in the UK) following a successful \"wet dress rehearsal\" - a critical pre-launch test where the rocket is filled with fuel and taken through the countdown sequence.It was the Artemis team's second attempt at a practice run at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\"Every night I look up at the Moon and I see it and I get real excited because I can feel she's calling us and we're ready,\" Nasa's Lori Glaze told a news conference on Friday.\"The excitement for Artemis II is really, really starting to build, we can really start to feel it. It's coming.\"The first rehearsal, which took place at the beginning of February, ended early because of a hydrogen fuel leak at the launch pad.Glaze said issues including with seals and filters had now been remedied.\"Yesterday we were able to fully tank the SLS rocket within the planned time line […] we also succesfully demonstrated the launch countdown,\" she said.Three Americans - Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch - and one Canadian, Jeremy Hansen, make up the Artemis II crew.Glaze said the crew were excited following the successful rehearsal and would go into quarantine later on Friday.They'll begin their journey on Nasa's mega Moon rocket: the 98m-tall (322ft) Space Launch System, or SLS.It's only flown once before in November 2022 for the Artemis I mission, but this was with no people onboard.The crew will be strapped into the Orion capsule, which is located at the top of the rocket.The inside of their spacecraft is about the size of a minibus, and it's where the four will live, eat, work and sleep during the 10-day mission.The first day of their journey will be spent in orbit around the Earth, then if all systems are working well, the astronauts will head towards the Moon.The voyage takes about four days, and the crew will travel around the far side of the Moon, which is the side we never see from Earth.They'll be at a distance of 6,500-9,500km (4,000 to 6,000 miles) above the lunar surface, and will have several hours dedicated to studying and taking images of the Moon.After the fly by, the astronauts will begin their four-day journey home. They will end the mission with a splash down in the Pacific Ocean.NASAApollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmitt visited the Moon in 1972The mission, if successful, will pave the way for Artemis III, which will see astronauts set foot on the lunar surface. The last time humans visited the Moon was in 1972 for the Apollo 17 mission.Nasa says the landing will happen by 2028, but this is a very ambitious timescale.Elon Musk's SpaceX company has a contract to build the lander for Artemis III - which will be flown to the Moon on a SpaceX Starship rocket. But delays to the Starship rocket have led Nasa to ask SpaceX for a new streamlined plan to speed a return to the Moon.Nasa has also asked rival company Blue Origin - which is owned by Jeff Bezos - to come up with an accelerated lunar plan for Artemis III.As the tech billionaires battle it out, the US is under pressure to return to the Moon. China is aiming for a lunar landing by 2030, and has been making steady progress towards this.Both nations are planning to land at the Moon's south pole - and are competing for the best spots to build their lunar bases.",

Researchers selected 23 hybrid tortoises with the closest genetic links to the extinct subspecies and began breeding them in captivity on Santa Cruz island.By 2025, more than 600 hatchlings had been produced, with several hundred now large enough to survive in the wild.The GCT described the giant tortoises as \"ecosystem engineers\" and said they played an \"outsized role in restoring degraded ecosystems\" because of the way their activity shapes landscapes.More on this story",

The teenager was airlifted to hospital from the slope in Nauders near the Swiss-Italian border.Three other skiers were killed in an avalanche near the popular St Anton resort, while a snowboarder died after being buried in the neighbouring Vorarlberg region.Austria has now seen at least 21 avalanche-related deaths this winter, while dozens of fatalities have been recorded across the Alps.The avalanche risk remains high in parts of Tyrol - meaning avalanches can be expected - where two fatal avalanches occurred on Friday in off-piste areas.Police told Austrian media the avalanche near St Anton am Arlberg, which killed three men, appeared to have been triggered by the skiers themselves.Two were American and Polish nationals, public broadcaster ORF reported, while the third was a 21-year-old Austrian who died in hospital.Two other men were recovered from the scene with injuries after a major operation involving four mountain rescue teams, three helicopters, as well as emergency services.Elsewhere, a 53-year-old man died after being crushed by a snow plough in the northern city of Linz.The vehicle slid down a set of stairs where the man had been clearing snow, ORF reported. He died at the scene.The significant snowfall in the region also caused power outages and transport chaos on Friday, particularly in the south-east.The Red Cross was deployed to help those stuck in traffic jams in the state of Styria, where a motoring organisation described the roads as \"virtually inaccessible to private vehicles\".Vienna International Airport temporarily closed in the morning, and afternoon services were \"disrupted\".The avalanche death toll in the Alps has been higher than usual this year, and includes three Britons killed in France's La Grave earlier this month.",

    "body": "2 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykEPA/ ShutterstockNasa has said that its early March launch day for its highly anticipated lunar mission would almost definitely be pushed back, after the agency spotted problems with the system's helium flow in safety checks.  On Friday, the space agency said that its Artemis II mission, which would see astronauts sent to the moon for the first time in 50 years, could launch as early as 6 March. But NASA administrator Jared Isaacman announced on Saturday that an interruption to helium flow will \"almost assuredly impact the March window\". Four astronauts are preparing to be sent on the 10-day trip to the far side of the Moon and back, marking humanity's furthest ever journey into space. The check on Thursday, which involved fuelling the rocket ​with some 730,000 ​gallons of propellant over the course of 50-hours, initially revealed no faults. But overnight on Friday, engineers observed an interruption in the flow of helium required for launch operations.\"This will almost assuredly impact the March launch window,\" NASA said in a statement on Saturday, adding that it would almost definitely delay its highly anticipated lunar mission. Disruption to helium, which is used to pressurise fuel tanks and cool rocket systems, is treated as a serious technical issue, according to Nasa. Nasa targets early March to send humans back around the MoonNASA's launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson had earlier said that Thursday's simulation felt like \"a big step in us earning our right to fly\", adding that he was \"very proud \"of the team. The test was the scientists' second attempt at a practice run at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, having fixed earlier issues with filters and seals that had led to hydrogen leaks. Three US astronauts, Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, and Canadian astronaut, Jeremy Hanse, are due to take off in the mega Moon rocket, which will allow them several hours to study the moon's surface up close. It is hoped that the mission, if successful, will pave the way for Artemis III, which will see astronauts set foot on the Moon for the first time since 1972. Nasa says the landing will happen by 2028, but accepted this could be an ambitious time frame. ",

    "body": "14 hours agoTom BatemanState Department correspondentAmmar Awad via ReutersThe mother of Nasrallah Abu Siyam, 19, grieves at his funeral on ThursdayThe family of a 19-year-old Palestinian-American man who they say was shot dead by an Israeli settler in the occupied West Bank have called for accountability over his killing.Nasrallah Abu Siyam was shot near the city of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, becoming at least the sixth American citizen killed by Israeli settlers or soldiers in the territory in the last two years. The Trump administration said it stood ready to provide consular assistance, but did not respond to claims its policies had failed to stem a surge in settler violence.The Israeli embassy in Washington said the incident was under review and an \"operational inquiry... must be completed as soon as possible\".Abu Siyam was a US citizen born in Philadelphia.His family said he was among approximately 30 residents of the village of Mukhmas who were trying to stop armed settlers from stealing their goats on Wednesday. As both residents and settlers threw stones, said one witness, settlers shot at least three of the villagers, including Abu Siyam, who was struck fatally. Abdulhamid Siyam, cousin to Abu Siyam, told the BBC that the 19-year-old's death was a \"big loss\" and the actions of settlers in the West Bank had gone unchecked.\"A young man of 19 shot and killed in this cold blood and no responsibility, impunity completely,\" he said.The Trump administration has faced criticism from rights groups for lifting Biden-era sanctions on violent settlers, who have rarely faced criminal punishments from Israeli authorities. The US State Department said it was aware of the death of a US citizen and was \"carefully monitoring the situation\". A spokesperson for the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) said that soldiers had attended the scene and used \"riot dispersal means to restore order\". \"No IDF fire  was reported during the course of the incident,\" the IDF statement said. The spokesperson confirmed that the incident was under review, and said \"a continuous military presence\" would remain in the area in the coming days to prevent further incidents.",

    "body": "3 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondentEPAIsraeli air strikes have killed at least 10 people in eastern Lebanon, Lebanese officials say, despite a ceasefire.Israel's military said it had targeted sites belonging to Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim militia and political party, in the Bekaa Valley, an area where the group has a strong presence.Hezbollah confirmed that at least eight of its members had been killed, including a senior field commander.The strikes were among the deadliest in Lebanon since a ceasefire ended the war between Israel and Hezbollah in November 2024.Despite the deal, which followed 13 months of conflict, Israel has carried out near-daily strikes on Lebanon, on targets it says are linked to the group, which is supported by Iran.Images posted online from one of the locations hit on Friday night showed heavy damage in what appeared to be a residential neighbourhood.In a statement, the Israeli military said it had struck what it described as Hezbollah command centres and that the group \"systematically embeds its assets within the civilian population\". It said the group's activities were \"a violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon\".In a separate statement on Saturday, the military said it had \"eliminated several terrorists of Hezbollah's missile array in three different command centres... recently identified as operating to accelerate the organisation's readiness and force build-up processes, while planning fire attacks towards Israel\".Hezbollah, considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US, says the ceasefire deal only applies to southern Lebanon, in the area between the Litani river and the Blue Line, the unofficial border between Lebanon and Israel.The group, however, has so far rejected calls from Lebanese authorities to discuss the future of its weapons elsewhere in the country, including in the Bekaa Valley, where part of its arsenal is believed to be located.This week, Hezbollah dismissed a decision by the government to advance the second phase of the disarmament plan in areas between north of the Litani and the Awali river, in the port city of Sidon.Lebanon's government says Israel's ongoing actions are a violation of the ceasefire deal and has urged the international community to put pressure on Israel to stop its attacks. Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam recently said the situation had become a \"one-sided war of attrition\".Hours before the attacks in the east, an Israeli strike hit the densely populated Palestinian refugee camp of Ain al-Helweh, on the outskirts of Sidon, in the country's south.The Israeli military said it had struck a \"command centre\" that had been used by Hamas, which said two members had been killed.The strikes come amid heightened tensions in the region, with the United States threatening to attack Iran if negotiations between the two countries fail to reach a deal.There are concerns in Lebanon that Iran might force Hezbollah to join its response to an attack if Israel becomes involved.",

After her parents' divorce, she is said to have brought up her own siblings.She became a reporter for the Sydney Daily Telegraph and the Sydney Daily Mirror, where she met Rupert Murdoch and went on to serve on the board of his company.\"He never made a major business decision without her input\", The Australian, another title in his media stable, writes.She penned several novels during their marriage, including the 1988 Family Business about a multi-generational media dynasty.

A years-long court battle ended with Murdoch's eldest son, Lachlan, being set to control the news group late last year.Murdoch-Mann went on to remarry, first to financier William Mann, who died in 2017. She later wed her third husband, Ashton dePeyster, who survives her along with 10 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.The philanthropist served on the boards of several children's hospitals including in Los Angeles and Haiti. In 1998, she was made a Dame of the Order of St Gregory by Pope John Paul II.",

    "body": "13 hours agoOttilie MitchellReutersEight people were killed in a mass shooting in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia earlier in FebruaryOpenAI banned a ChatGPT account owned by the suspect of a mass shooting in British Columbia more than half a year before the attack took place.The AI company said they had identified an account owned by Jesse Van Rootselaar in June 2025 under abuse and enforcement detection, which includes identifying accounts being used to further violence.OpenAI said it did not alert authorities to the account because its usage did not meet its threshold of a credible or imminent plan for serious physical harm to others.It said its thoughts were with everyone affected by the tragedy and that following the attack it had \"proactively\" contacted Canadian police with information on the suspect.Van Rootselaar is suspected of having shot and killed eight people in rural Tumbler Ridge on 12 February in one of the deadliest attacks in Canada's history. According to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the story, \"about a dozen staffers debated whether to take action on Van Rootselaar's posts.\"Some had identified the suspect's usage of the AI tool as an indication of real world violence and encouraged leaders to alert authorities, the US outlet reported. But, it said, leaders of the company decided not to do so.In a statement, a spokesperson for OpenAI said: \"In June 2025, we proactively identified an account associated with this individual [Jesse Van Rootselaar] via our abuse detection and enforcement efforts, which include automated tools and human investigations to identify misuses of our models in furtherance of violent activities.\"They said the company would continue to support the police's investigation.The BBC has contacted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for comment.OpenAI has said it will uphold its policy of alerting authorities only in cases of imminent risk because alerting them too broadly could cause unintended harm. It has also said that it trains ChatGPT to discourage imminent real-world harm when it identifies a dangerous situation and to refuse to help people that are attempting to use the service for illegal activities.The company added that it is constantly reviewing its referral criteria with experts and that it is reviewing the case for improvements. The deadly attack on Tumbler Ridge Secondary School saw a further 27 people injured.Van Rootselaar was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the school. Police said the suspect was born a biological male but identified as a woman.Van Rootselaars's mother and step-brother were among the victims of the shooting. Both were found dead at a local residence, police said.The motive for the attack is not yet known.",

    "body": "4 hours agoMaia Davies''Domenico is gone'' says mother of toddler who died after receiving damaged heartA toddler in Italy who received a damaged donor heart has died, the family's lawyer has said.Two-year-old Domenico died shortly before 09:30 local time (08:30 GMT) on Saturday, Francesco Petruzzi told reporters. Monaldi Hospital, where he was being treated, said he had suffered a \"sudden and irreversible worsening of his clinical condition\".The heart given to Domenico during a transplant in late December was reportedly transported to the hospital in direct contact with dry ice, causing severe tissue damage.Prosecutors have opened an investigation into the incident and six medics have been placed under formal investigation in a case which has sparked outrage in Italy.Petruzzi has said the organ arrived \"burned by frostbite\" after being transported over 800km (490 miles) from Bolzano to Naples in an unsuitable container alongside the ice, without a thermometer to alert the medical team to the low temperature.The two-year-old had been on life support in Naples for almost two months. His mother Patrizia Mercolino had appealed to the Pope to help her son.\"It's over. Domenico is gone,\" Mercolino told reporters on Saturday.She said a foundation would be established in his name.The family's lawyer said the foundation would be for \"all children who cannot have a transplant and to help all victims of malpractice and medical negligence\".Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the \"whole of Italy mourns the loss of little Domenico, a warrior who will never be forgotten\".She wrote on X: \"On behalf of myself and the government, I offer my sincerest condolences and deepest sympathy to his mother Patrizia, his father Antonio and all his loved ones.\"I am certain that the competent authorities will shed full light on this terrible incident.\"On Wednesday, a panel of paediatric specialists concluded Domenico's condition was \"not compatible\" with another transplant.Doctors had warned a prolonged use of the life support system might have compromised his lungs, liver and kidneys.Petruzzi said at the time the family wanted to see all the relevant medical records: \"If the time for hope has ended, then the time for responsibility has begun.\"Italy's Health Minister Orazio Schillaci said earlier this week that \"we must absolutely clarify what happened\".\"We owe it to the child, to the family, but also to all Italians.\"\"We have an excellent national health service, which has been able to handle and almost always resolve complex situations. So, I believe citizens should not lose faith.\"",

    "body": "1 day agoMohammad Sartaj AlamBBC Hindi, JharkhandMohammad Sartaj Alam/BBCThe spot where the woman and child were burned after a mob stormed their houseFour people have been arrested in the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand for allegedly burning to death a woman and her 10-month-old son on suspicion of practising witchcraft earlier this week.The woman's husband, who was also attacked, suffered severe burns and is in hospital.Police say they are searching for more people who may be involved. The accused are in custody and haven't commented publicly yet.According to the National Crime Records Bureau, more than 2,500 people, mostly women, were killed in India on suspicion of witchcraft between 2000 and 2016.Mohammad Sartaj Alam/BBCThe murders occurred in the Kudsai hamlet of Jharkhand stateSuch cases are often reported from areas inhabited by disadvantaged tribal communities, where superstition is rife and a non-existent public health system leads to dependence on quacks for medical advice.The murders in Jharkhand occurred in the Kudsai hamlet, a remote tribal settlement of around 50 mud houses located 250km (155.3 miles) from the state capital, Ranchi.​The violence appears to have been triggered by recent incidents in the village, including rumours of sudden cattle deaths and the illness and death of a local man named Pustun Birua.His wife Jano Birua says she consulted an informal healthcare provider - common in villages where no doctors are available - when he began suffering from anxiety and fainting spells. He told her that her husband was not suffering from any physical illness.Asked why she did not take him to a hospital, she said: \"We are poor people, so it wasn't possible to take him that far.\"Meanwhile, rumours spread that Jyoti Sinku was practising witchcraft and was responsible for the man's illness.Pustun Birua died on Tuesday evening. That night, according to Jyoti's husband Kolhan Sinku who is in hospital, a mob of about a dozen people, including five women, stormed their home and set fire to his wife and child.Recalling the horror from his hospital bed, he said: ​\"I pleaded with folded hands to have the matter resolved in the village council but the attackers didn't listen to me.\"Based on the testimonies of Kolhan Sinku and another family member, the district police have registered a complaint of murder and criminal conspiracy.Police say four men have been arrested and a special police team has been set up to track down other members of the mob.They added that they would organise programmes in rural areas to raise awareness against superstitions.",

An autopsy did not reveal any evidence of foul play.Griffiths co-founded Asos in 2000 and remained a significant shareholder after leaving the firm five years later.City AM/ShutterstockQuentin Griffiths, pictured in 2008An Asos spokesperson said: \"We're saddened to hear about the passing of Quentin, one of our original co-founders.\"He played an important role in Asos's earliest days and we're forever grateful for his contribution.\"Our thoughts are with his family and friends.\"A Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"We are supporting the family of a British national who has died in Thailand and are in contact with the local authorities.\"Police in Pattaya told the BBC Griffiths was found dead outside a luxury hotel where he had been staying in as a long-term resident in a suite on the 17th floor.He was involved in two ongoing court cases that might have caused him stress, police also told the BBC.Griffiths was separated from his second wife, a Thai national, and had reportedly been engaged in a legal dispute with her over a business they ran together, the BBC understands.He co-founded Asos in London with Nick Robertson, Andrew Regan and Deborah Thorpe.Its name originally stood for As Seen On Screen as it sold fashion inspired by clothing worn by TV and film stars.It grew to become an online fashion marketplace stocking hundreds of brands as well as its own lines and at one time was valued at more than £6bn.Its largest shareholders include Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen - who owns Danish clothing giant Bestseller and Mike Ashley, owner of Frasers Group.Additional reporting by Thanyarat Doksone in BangkokIf you are suffering distress or despair, details of help and support in the UK are available at BBC Action Line",

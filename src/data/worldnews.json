    "body": "The Spanish town of Terrassa in north-eastern Catalonia has temporarily banned the adoption of black cats from animal shelters to prevent potentially sinister \"rituals\" during Halloween.All requests for the fostering or adoption of the felines will be denied from 6 October to 10 November to protect them from being hurt or used as props, said the local animal welfare service. Deputy Mayor Noel Duque told broadcaster RTVE that adoption requests for black cats usually increase around Halloween.While black cats are often associated with witchcraft and seen as bad luck in Western culture, many other cultures, including Japan and Egypt, see them as symbols of prosperity and fortune.Terassa's city council said there had been no record of cruelty towards black cats in the town, however there have been incidents in other areas and the decision was taken after warnings from animal welfare groups.\"We try to prevent people from adopting because it's trendy or impulsively. And in cases like these, which we know exist, to prevent any macabre practices,\" Duque said.Terrassa is home to more than 9,800 cats, according to local authorities, and the town's adoption centre houses around 100 felines, 12 of which are black, the Catalan News Agency reported.The city council emphasised that the measure is \"temporary and exceptional\" and represents an extra precaution for animal welfare, but did not rule out repeating the ban in the future.Exceptions during the ban period will be assessed individually by the adoption centre and normal fostering requests will resume after Halloween.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump has said the US will return two people who survived a strike on what he called a \"drug-carrying submarine\" to their countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia.Writing on social media, Trump said two other people were killed in the US strike on the vessel, which he said US intelligence confirmed was \"loaded up with mostly Fentanyl, and other illegal narcotics\". The attack on Thursday is at least the sixth US strike on ships in the Caribbean Sea in recent weeks. It is the first time survivors have been reported.At least 27 people were killed in the prior five boat strikes in the waters off Venezuela, according to figures released by the administration.The two survivors were rescued by a US military helicopter and then shuttled onto a US warship in the Caribbean, unnamed US officials told US media earlier. On Saturday evening, Colombian President Gustavo Petro wrote on X: \"We received the Colombian detained in the narco submarine; we are glad that he is alive and he will be processed in accordance with the laws.\"BBC SOUNDS: Why has Trump authorised CIA action in Venezuela?In recent weeks, Trump has ramped up threats against Venezuela's leadership over claims that the country is sending drugs to the US. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused Trump of trying to make the South American nation \"an American colony\".Trump has defended the ongoing boat attacks, saying they are aimed at stemming the flow of drugs from Latin America into the US, but his government has not provided evidence or details about the identities of the vessels or those on board.\"It was my great honor to destroy a very large DRUG-CARRYING SUBMARINE that was navigating towards the United States on a well known narcotrafficking transit route,\" Trump said in his Truth Social post on Saturday.\"The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution.\"He added that no US military personnel were injured in the attack. On Friday, the US president had said the submarine targeting the latest attack was \"built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs\". \"This was not an innocent group of people. I don't know too many people who have submarines, and that was an attack on a drug-carrying, loaded submarine,\" he added.UN-appointed human rights experts have described the US strikes as \"extrajudicial executions\".Trump earlier told reporters that he had authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, and that he was considering launching attacks on Venezuelan soil.Narco-subs have become a popular way to transport drugs as they can go largely undetected, and can be sunk after delivery. They are often homemade and constructed using fibreglass and plywood. The US, as well as other coastal nations, have previously intercepted some of these subs.",

    "body": "Shohei Ohtani delivered one of the greatest performances in baseball history as defending champions the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Milwaukee Brewers to reach the World Series.Japan's Ohtani smashed three huge home runs and struck out 10 Brewers batters in a comprehensive 5-1 victory as the Dodgers swept the series 4-0.The 31-year-old's trifecta of home runs and 10 strikeouts in the same game is a Major League Baseball post-season record, highlighting a rare talent of excelling with bat and ball. Ohtani also became the first pitcher since the Boston Braves' Jim Tobin in 1942 to hit three home runs in the same game.\"It was really fun on both sides of the ball today,\" said Ohtani, who was awarded the Most Valuable Player award for his heroics.\"I'm taking this trophy and let's get four more wins. We won it as a team and this is really a team effort. I hope everybody in LA and Japan and all over the world could enjoy a really good sake [Japanese rice wine].\"Ohtani's entered the game at the Dodger Stadium on the back of an eight-game home run drought, but led from the front as he struck out three batters in the opening frame.He then starred with the bat in a performance which included a crushing 446 foot home run and a monster 469 foot hit which bounced out of the stadium.It marked another historic showing from Ohtani, who last year became the first player ever to record 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in the same season.\"That was probably the greatest post-season performance of all time,\" said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts. \"There's a reason why he's the greatest player on the planet. It's kind of whatever you don't expect, expect him to do it.\"This is just a performance that I've just never seen. No-one's ever seen something like this. I'm still in awe right now of Shohei.\"The Dodgers' comfortable victory sets up a World Series showdown against the Toronto Blue Jays or Seattle Mariners, with the latter 3-2 up in the best-of-seven series.",

    "body": "4 hours agoIan AikmanReutersHamas says it has been working to recover the remains of dead hostages beneath the rubble left by Israeli attacks on the Gaza StripIsrael has received two bodies from Gaza that Hamas says are hostages, the Israeli prime minister's office has said.The remains, which were transferred via the Red Cross to Israeli forces, were transported to Israel and will be formally identified. Hamas earlier said the bodies had been recovered in the Palestinian territory on Saturday.Prior to Saturday, the remains of 10 of 28 deceased hostages had been returned to Israel.The delay has caused outrage in Israel, as the terms of last week's ceasefire deal stipulated the release from Gaza of all hostages, living and dead. Hamas says it has struggled to find the remaining bodies under rubble.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has ordered the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt to remain closed until further notice, and said its reopening would be considered based on the return of the final hostage remains and the implementation of the ceasefire agreement.The Rafah crossing is vital for Palestinians who need medical assistance to leave, and for thousands of others to return.The IDF has stressed that Hamas must \"uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages\".But the US has downplayed suggestions that the delay amounts to a breach of the ceasefire deal, which President Donald Trump claimed as a major victory on a visit to Israel and Egypt last week.The text of the deal has not been published, but a leaked version that was seen in Israeli media appeared to account for the possibility that not all of the bodies would be immediately accessible.Hamas has blamed Israel for making the task difficult, as air strikes on Gaza have reduced many buildings to rubble, and Israel does not allow heavy machinery and diggers into the territory.UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told the BBC News Channel that the Gaza Strip \"is now a wasteland\", with people picking through the rubble for bodies and trying to find their homes - many of which have been flattened.As part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Hamas also returned all 20 living hostages to Israel. Israel's military confirmed the identity of the tenth deceased hostage returned by Hamas on Friday. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) named him as Eliyahu Margalit, whose body was taken from Nir Oz kibbutz after he was killed on 7 October 2023.Hostages and Missing Families ForumIsrael's Hostages and Missing Families Forum described Mr Margalit as \"a cowboy at heart\" who managed a horse stables for many yearsAlso as part of the deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza. The bodies of 15 Palestinians were handed over by Israel via the Red Cross to officials in Gaza on Saturday, the Hamas-run health ministry said, bringing the total number of bodies it has received to 135.Separately on Saturday, 11 members of one Palestinian family were killed by an Israeli tank shell, according to the Hamas-run civil defence ministry, in what was the deadliest single incident involving Israeli soldiers in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire. The Israeli military said soldiers had fired at a \"suspicious vehicle\" that had crossed the so-called yellow line demarcating the area still occupied by Israeli forces in Gaza. There are no physical markers of this line, and it is unclear if the bus did cross it. The BBC has asked the IDF for the coordinates of the incident.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 68,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.In September, a UN commission of inquiry said Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel categorically rejected the report as \"distorted and false\".",

    "body": "Baek Se-hee, the South Korean author of the bestselling memoir I Want to Die but I Want To Eat Tteokbokki has died at the age of 35.Her 2018 book, a compilation of conversations with her psychiatrist about her depression, was a cultural phenomenon with its themes of mental health resonating with readers across the world.Originally written in Korean, it found international acclaim after its English translation was published in 2022.The details surrounding her death are unclear.Baek donated her organs - her heart, lungs, liver and kidneys - which have helped to save five lives, the Korean Organ Donation Agency said in a statement on Friday.The statement also included comments from her sister, which said that Baek had wanted to \"share her heart with others through her work, and to inspire hope\".I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki, published in 2018, has sold more than a million copies worldwide and been translated in 25 countries.The runaway bestseller was celebrated for normalising mental health conversations and its nuanced take on inner struggles - most notably, the author's personal conflict between depressive thoughts and her appreciation for simple joys.\"The human heart, even when it wants to die, quite often wants at the same time to eat some tteokbokki, too,\" goes the book's most famous line. Tteokbokki, which are tubular chewy rice cakes usually eaten with a spicy sauce or stew, is a popular snack in Korean cuisine.Born in 1990, Baek Se-hee took creative writing in university and worked for five years at a publishing house, according to her short biography on Bloomsbury Publishing, which produced the English version of her 2018 memoir.Anton Hur, who had translated Baek's book into English, wrote on Instagram that her organs have saved five people but \"her readers will know she touched yet millions of lives more with her writing\".\"My thoughts are with her family,\" he wrote.For a decade she received treatment for dysthymia, a mild but long-lasting type of depression, which formed the basis of her bestseller, said her Bloomsbury bio.A sequel, I Want to Die but I Still Want to Eat Tteokbokki, was published in Korean in 2019. Its English translation was published in 2024.Tributes have poured in on social media. \"Rest softly,\" reads a comment on Baek's Instagram page. \"Thank you for saving us with your honesty.\"Another Instagram user said each time they read Baek's memoir they found \"deep comfort in every sentence and grew alongside it\". \"To create a single book that can lift people up... is no easy task, and I have indescribable respect for you for achieving that,\" they wrote.A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line.

    "body": "10 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent  , JerusalemGaza's Hamas-run civil defence says 11 people were killed, all from the same family, after the bus they were in was hit by an Israeli tank shell in northern Gaza.The Abu Shaaban family, it said, were trying to reach their home to inspect it when the incident happened in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City on Friday night.This is the deadliest single incident involving Israeli soldiers in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire eight days ago.The Israeli military said soldiers had fired at a \"suspicious vehicle\" that had crossed the so-called yellow line demarcating the area still occupied by Israeli forces in Gaza.Israeli soldiers continue to operate in more than half of the Gaza Strip, under the terms of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement.Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP news agency the victims were killed while \"trying to check on their home\" in the area.The dead included women and children, according to the civil defence.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said a \"suspicious vehicle was identified crossing the yellow line and approaching IDF troops operating in the northern Gaza Strip\" on Friday, prompting it to fire \"warning shots\" towards the vehicle.It said the vehicle \"continued to approach the troops in a way that caused an imminent threat to them\" and \"troops opened fire to remove the threat, in accordance with the agreement.\"Hamas said the family had been targeted without justification.The IDF has warned Palestinians from entering areas in Gaza still under its control. With limited internet access, many Palestinians do not know the position of Israeli troops as the yellow demarcation line is not physically marked, and it is unclear if the area where the bus was travelling did cross it.The BBC has asked the IDF for coordinates of the incident.Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said on Friday the army would set up visual signs to indicate the location of the line.In a separate development, Hamas on Friday released the body of Israeli hostage Eliyahu Margalit to the Red Cross, which returned it to Israel.Mr Margalit was the tenth deceased hostage to be returned from Gaza. The remains of another 18 people are yet to be repatriated. Israel handed the bodies of 15 more Palestinians over to officials in Gaza via the Red Cross, the Hamas-run health ministry said, bringing the total number of bodies it has received to 135.There has been anger in Israel that Hamas has not returned all of the dead hostages' bodies, in line with last week's ceasefire deal - though the US has downplayed the suggestion it amounts to a breach.The IDF has stressed that Hamas must \"uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages\".Hamas has blamed Israel for making the task difficult because Israeli strikes have reduced so many buildings to rubble and it does not allow heavy machinery and diggers into Gaza to be able to search for the hostages' bodies.As part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Hamas also returned all 20 living hostages to Israel.

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has commuted the sentence of George Santos, a former Republican congressman serving seven years in prison for fraud and identity theft. In a post on social media, Trump said Santos \"has been horribly mistreated\", adding: \"Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life!\"The former lawmaker was only the sixth in US history to be expelled from Congress, after a damning ethics report in 2023. Santos, who admitted to stealing the identities of 11 people, including his own family members, was released on Friday night, US media reported. He served less than three months of a seven-year sentence.\"God bless President Donald J Trump,\" said one of Santos's lawyers, Joseph Murray, following Trump's announcement.In April when Santos was sentenced a judge told him: \"You got elected with your words, most of which were lies.\"He reportedly cried in court and begged for forgiveness, saying: \"I cannot rewrite the past, but I can control the road ahead.\"Prosecutors argued that the novice politician had lied about his background and misused campaign funds to finance his lifestyle.In his post, Trump justified the move by criticising a Democratic lawmaker, Senator Richard Blumenthal, whom he accused of fabricating his US military service. \"This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\" Trump wrote.Trump has previously called for an investigation into Blumenthal over the claim. The Democrat has acknowledged that he misspoke on numerous occasions about his time in the military, but has said the mishaps were more than a decade old. \"This allegation of 15 years ago has been really rejected by the voters of Connecticut three times, overwhelmingly re-electing me,\" Blumenthal told CNN earlier this month. Santos's downfall began in 2022, after the New York Times published an investigation revealing the freshman congressman had lied about his CV, including having a university degree and working for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.From there, the lies continued to pile up, including allegations that he stole money from a fundraiser for a dying dog and that he lied about his mother surviving the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Shortly afterwards, local and federal officials began to investigate.He was eventually charged with 23 federal felony crimes, and in 2023 became the first expelled member of Congress in more than 20 years, and only the sixth in history.A report from the House ethics panel accused him of misusing campaign funds for personal benefits, including Botox and subscriptions on the OnlyFans website.Santos defeated a Democratic incumbent in 2022, flipping the district that encompasses parts of New York's Long Island and Queens, where he grew up.Earlier this week, Santos published an open letter to Trump in the South Shore Press newspaper in Long Island, repeating his plea to be pardoned. The letter, which was titled a \"passionate plea to President Trump\" asked for \"the opportunity to return to my family, my friends, and my community.\"He wrote that he had been kept in solitary confinement after a death threat in August, and apologised for his actions. \"Mr President, I am not asking for sympathy. I am asking for fairness - for the chance to rebuild,\" he wrote.\"I know I have made mistakes in my past. I have faced my share of consequences, and I take full responsibility for my actions. \"But no man, no matter his flaws, deserves to be lost in the system, forgotten and unseen, enduring punishment far beyond what justice requires.\"Santos began serving his sentence in July at a minimum-security jail in New Jersey.Trump has issued pardons to at least two other former Republican lawmakers since returning to office in January.In May, he pardoned former congressman Michael Grimm, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to tax crimes.He also pardoned former Connecticut Governor John Rowland, who pleaded guilty in 2004 to corruption and fraud charges.Commutations do not void criminal convictions, unlike a pardon.",

    "body": "5 hours agoAna FaguyGetty ImagesAfter serving 43 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, Subramanyam \"Subu\" Vedam was finally free. New evidence had exonerated him earlier this month of the murder of his former roommate.But before he could reach his family's arms, Mr Vedam was taken into custody by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), who want to deport him to India - a country he has not lived in since he was a baby.Now, Mr Vedam's legal team is fighting a deportation order and his family is determined to get him out of custody, for good.His family are now working to navigate a new and \"very different\" situation, his sister Saraswathi Vedam told the BBC. Her brother has gone from a facility where he knew inmates and guards alike, where he mentored fellow inmates, and where he had his own cell, to a facility where he shares a room with 60 men and where his history of good behaviour and mentorship is unknown.Mr Vedam has been repeating one message to his sister and other family members in the wake of the new situation: \"I want us to focus on the win.\"\"My name has been cleared, I'm no longer a prisoner, I'm a detainee.\"The 1980 murderMore than 40 years ago, Mr Vedam was convicted of murdering his once-roommate Tom Kinser, a 19-year-old college student. Kinser's body was found nine months after he went missing in a wooded area with a bullet wound in his skull. On the day of Kinser's disappearance, Mr Vedam had asked him for a ride. While the vehicle Kinser drove was returned to its usual spot, no one saw it being returned. Mr Vedam was charged with Kinser's murder. He was denied bail, had his passport and green card seized by authorities and was labelled a \"foreigner likely to flee\".Two years later he was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1984, he was sentenced to a separate two-and-a-half to five years for a drug offence, as part of a plea agreement. That sentence was to be served simultaneously with his life sentence. Throughout that time, Mr Vedam maintained his innocence on the murder charges. His supporters and family members stressed there was no physical evidence tying him to the crime. Getty ImagesMr Vedam's exoneration Mr Vedam repeatedly appealed the murder conviction and a few years ago new evidence in the case surfaced which exonerated. Earlier this month, Centre County District Attorney Bernie Cantorna said he would not pursue a new trial against Mr Vedam.But Mr Vedam's family knew there was one hurdle left before he was free: he still had a 1988 deportation order, based on his convictions for murder and a drug offence. The family expected they would have to file a motion to have his immigration case reopened, Ms Vedam said. The facts of the case are different now, she stressed.But when they arrested him, ICE cited the immigration order as their reasoning for quickly detaining him in a different Pennsylvania facility. While he was exonerated for the murder charge, his drug conviction still stands, they have said. The immigration agency said it acted on a lawfully issued order.ICE did not respond to the BBC's request for comment, but told other US outlets that Mr Vedam will remain in custody pending his deportation. Mr Vedam's family has said his decades of good behaviour, completion of three degrees and community service while behind bars should be considered when the immigration court examines his case.\"What was deeply disappointing was that we didn't even have a moment to hold him in our arms,\" Ms Vedam said. \"He was held wrongly and one would think that he conducted himself with such honour and purpose and integrity that that should mean something.\"Potential deportation to IndiaThe family has stressed Mr Vedam's ties to India - where ICE has said they would like to deport him to - are weak at best. While he was born there, he moved to the US at nine months old. What relatives are still alive, are distant ones, Ms Vedam told the BBC.His community - Ms Vedam, her four daughters and other cousins - are in the US and Canada. \"He will again be robbed and miss out on the lives of the people closet to him, by being half way across the world,\" she said. \"It's almost like having his life stolen twice.\"Mr Vedam, who is a legal permanent resident, had his citizenship application accepted before he was arrested. Both of his parents were also both US citizens.\"We believe deportation from the United States now, to send him to a country where he has few connections, would represent another terrible wrong done to a man who has already endured a record-setting injustice,\" his lawyer, Ava Benach said in a statement to the BBC.",

    "body": "Chen Ning Yang, Nobel laureate and one of the world's most influential physicists, has died at the age of 103, according to Chinese state media.An obituary released by CCTV cited illness as the cause of death.Yang and fellow theoretical physicist, Lee Tsung-Dao, were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957 for their work in parity laws, which led to important discoveries regarding elementary particles - the building blocks of matter. Yang was also a professor at Beijing's prestigious Tsinghua University and an honorary dean of the Institute for Advanced Study at the institution.Born in 1922 in China's eastern Anhui province, he was the oldest of five children and raised on the campus of Tsinghua University where his father was a professor of mathematics.As a teenager, Yang told his parents: \"One day, I want to win the Nobel Prize.\"He achieved that dream at the age of 35, when his work with Lee studying the law of parity earned them the honour in 1957.The Nobel committee praised \"their penetrating investigation... which has led to important discoveries regarding the elementary particles\".Yang received his science degree in 1942 from National Southwest Associated University in Kunming, and later completed a master's degree at Tsinghua University.At the end of the Sino-Japanese War, he travelled to the US on a fellowship from Tsinghua and studied at the University of Chicago, where he worked under Italian physicist Enrico Fermi, inventor of the world's first nuclear reactor.Throughout a prolific career, he worked across all areas of physics, but maintained particular interest in the fields of statistical mechanics and symmetry principles.Yang received the Albert Einstein Commemorative Award in 1957 and was also awarded an honorary doctorate by Princeton University in 1958.Yang married his first wife Chih Li Tu in 1950, with whom he had three children.After Tu's death in 2003, Yang married his second wife Weng Fan, who is more than 50 years his junior.The pair had first met in 1995 when Weng was a student in a physics seminar, and later reconnected in 2004. At the time, Yang called her his \"final blessing from God\".",

    "body": "9 hours agoIan AikmanBBCA large crowd gathered for the players' funeral on SaturdayAfghanistan will no longer take part in an upcoming cricket series after three players in a local tournament were killed in an air strike, the nation's cricketing body says.The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) said it would withdraw from November's tri-nation T20 series out of respect for the dead, who it said were \"targeted\" in an \"attack carried out by the Pakistani regime\" on Friday. The three did not play for the national team.The strike hit a home in Urgon district in Paktika province, where the players were eating dinner after a match, witnesses and local officials told the BBC.Eight people were killed, the ACB said. Pakistan said the strike hit militants and denied targeting civilians.The ACB named the three players who were killed as Kabeer Agha, Sibghatullah and Haroon, calling their deaths \"a great loss for Afghanistan's sports community, its athletes, and the cricketing family\".The International Cricket Council (ICC) said it was \"deeply saddened and appalled\" by the \"tragic deaths of three young and promising Afghan cricketers\" in an air strike that also \"claimed the lives of several civilians\".\"The ICC stands in solidarity with the Afghanistan Cricket Board and echoes their grief,\" it said in a statement, adding that it \"strongly condemns this act of violence\".The attack came hours after a temporary truce between Afghanistan and Pakistan was due to expire following days of deadly clashes on the border between the two nations. Dozens of casualties have been reported.Pakistan said it had targeted Afghan militants in the air strike and that at least 70 combatants had been killed. Pakistan's Minister of Information Attaullah Tarar said claims that the attack targeted civilians are \"false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan\".Afghanistan Cricket Board/XThe Afghanistan Cricket Board shared this image of the three players who were killedIn a social media post, Afghan national team captain Rashid Khan paid tribute to the \"aspiring young cricketers who dreamed of representing their nation on the world stage\".Other players for the Afghan national side joined the tributes, including Fazalhaq Farooqi, who said the attack was a \"heinous, unforgivable crime\".On Saturday, large crowds of people were seen gathering at the funeral for the strike's victims.The strike came after Pakistani officials said seven soldiers were killed in a suicide attack near the Afghan border on Friday.The 48-hour truce between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which began on Wednesday at 13:00 GMT, has reportedly been extended to allow for negotiations.An Afghan delegation arrived in the Qatari capital of Doha on Saturday for peace talks with the Pakistani side. The Taliban government said it would take part in the talks despite \"Pakistani aggression\", which it says was Islamabad's attempt to prolong the conflict.Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Pakistan should \"reconsider its policies, and pursue friendly and civilised relations\" with Afghanistan.Pakistan's Foreign Office said on Saturday that Defence Minister Khawaja Asif would lead the country's delegation in Doha.It said the talks will focus on ending cross-border terrorism and restoring peace and stability on the Pakistan-Afghan border.Zimbabwe will now replace Afghanistan in the T20 series.",

    "body": "Mystery heatwave warms Pacific Ocean to new record1 day agoMark Poynting and Matt McGrathBBC News Climate and ScienceKevin Carter/Getty ImagesPeople head to the coast in San Diego on a hot summer's day The waters of the north Pacific have had their warmest summer on record, according to BBC analysis of a mysterious marine heatwave that has confounded climate scientists.Sea surface temperatures between July and September were more than 0.25C above the previous high of 2022 - a big increase across an area roughly ten times the size of the Mediterranean.While climate change is known to make marine heatwaves more likely, scientists are struggling to explain why the north Pacific has been so hot for so long.But all this extra heat in the so-called \"warm blob\" may have the opposite effect in the UK, possibly making a colder start to winter more likely, some researchers believe.\"There's definitely something unusual going on in the north Pacific,\" said Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, a research group in the US.Such a jump in temperatures across a region so large is \"quite remarkable\", he added.The BBC analysed data from the European Copernicus climate service to calculate average temperatures between July and September across a large area of the north Pacific, sometimes known as the \"warm blob\". The region extends from the east coast of Asia to the west coast of North America, the same area used in previous scientific studies.The figures show that not only has the region been warming quickly over the past couple of decades, but 2025 is markedly higher than recent years too.That the seas are getting hotter is no surprise. Global warming, caused by humanity's emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases, has already trebled the number of days of extreme heat in oceans globally, according to research published earlier this year.But temperatures have been even higher than most climate models - computer simulations taking into account humanity's carbon emissions - had predicted.Analysis of these models by the Berkeley Earth group suggests that sea temperatures observed across the north Pacific in August had less than a 1% chance of occurring in any single year.Natural weather variability is thought to be part of the reason. This summer has seen weaker-than-usual winds, for example. That means more heat from the summer sunshine can stay in the sea surface, rather than being mixed with cooler waters below.But this can only go so far in explaining the exceptional conditions, according to Dr Hausfather.\"It certainly is not just natural variability,\" he said. \"There's something else going on here as well.\"One intriguing idea is that a recent change to shipping fuels might be contributing to the warming. Prior to 2020, dirty engine oil produced large amounts of sulphur dioxide, a gas harmful to human health.But that sulphur also formed tiny, Sun-reflecting particles in the atmosphere, known as aerosols, which helped to keep a lid on rising temperatures.So removing that cooling effect in shipping hotspots like the north Pacific could be revealing the full impact of human-caused warming.\"It does seem like sulphur is the primary candidate for what's driving this warming in the region,\" said Dr Hausfather.Other research suggests that efforts to reduce air pollution in Chinese cities has played a role in warming the Pacific too.That dirty air did a similar job to shipping in reflecting sunlight away, while cleaning it up could have had the unintended consequence of allowing more ocean heating.Possible impacts for the UK?The north Pacific's marine heatwave has already had consequences for weather on both sides of the Pacific, likely boosting very high summer temperatures in Japan and South Korea and storms in the US.\"In California, we've seen supercharged thunderstorms because the warm ocean waters in the Pacific provide heat and moisture,\" said Amanda Maycock, professor in climate dynamics at the University of Leeds.\"In particular, there are things we call atmospheric rivers… bands of air, which contain very high amounts of moisture that fuel themselves from the ocean waters,\" she added.\"So if we have warm ocean waters… they can then bring a lot of moisture onto the land, which then falls out as rain, or in the wintertime can precipitate out as snow.\"ReutersThe intense heat to hit Japan in August was likely amplified by Pacific Ocean heat, researchers sayLong-term weather forecasting is always challenging, but extreme heat in the north Pacific has the potential to affect the UK and Europe in the coming months too.That's because of relationships between weather in different parts of the world known as teleconnections.\"Although the current warm conditions are located in the north Pacific, these can generate wave motions in the atmosphere that can alter our weather downstream into the north Atlantic and into Europe,\" said Prof Maycock.\"That can tend to favour high-pressure conditions over the continent, which brings us more of an influence from the Arctic, where we have colder air,\" she added.\"That can be drawn over Europe and bring us colder weather in early winter.\"A colder outcome is by no means certain, as this is a complex area of science. Several other weather patterns also affect UK winters, which are typically getting milder with climate change.And a warm north Pacific appears to have different effects later in the winter, favouring milder and wetter conditions in some parts of Europe.Emerging La Niña in the tropical PacificAnother factor to throw into the mix is what's happening further south in the eastern tropical Pacific.There, surface waters are unusually cool - a classic sign of the weather phenomenon known as La Niña.La Niña, and its warm sibling El Niño, are natural patterns, although research published this week highlighted that global warming could itself impact the swings between them.Weak La Niña conditions are expected to persist over the next few months, according to NOAA, the US science agency.All else being equal, La Niña generally increases the risk of a cold start to winter in the UK, but also brings a higher chance of a mild end, the Met Office says.\"These two drivers in the north and tropical Pacific will be acting together this winter,\" said Prof Maycock.\"But since the La Niña is quite weak this year, the extreme warmth in the north Pacific could be more important for forecasting the winter ahead.\"Additional reporting by Muskeen Liddar and Libby RogersMore weekend picks",

    "body": "Scientists say seven skeletons found in a mass grave in Croatia were most likely Roman soldiers who lived 1,700 years ago.The male skeletons, all with various injuries, were found \"completely preserved\" during excavations in 2011 at the site of the Roman city of Mursa - modern-day Osijek - in Croatia's far east, a new research paper says.Mursa was conquered by the Romans during the first century BC and became a large settlement that was also an important centre for trade and craft.Now, researchers from several European archaeological institutions have been able to determine not only when the men lived, but also how they may have died.According to the paper, the men in the grave were aged between 36-50 years old, taller-than-average in height, and were \"robust\" individuals. Their diets were mainly vegetarian, but some had also indulged in a little meat and seafood.All showed various healed and un-healed injuries, including those caused by blunt force trauma, and there were puncture wounds on two of their torsos, which the scientists believe were likely caused by arrows or spear tips. All of the men were suffering from some kind of \"pulmonary [affecting the lungs] disease during the final days of their lives\". DNA analysis has also revealed the men had a mix of ancestry and that none appeared to be from the local area. The paper noted that the Roman Empire was a particularly violent era and that Mursa was involved in several conflicts. The researchers believe the men were likely victims of the 'Crisis of the Third Century', most probably the battle of Mursa from 260 CE, when there were \"numerous battles fought between various claimants to the throne\".The paper states that the pit the skeletons were found in would have originally been a water-well - several of which have been discovered in the area. It notes that mass burials and mass graves were \"not a customary way of interring the dead in the Roman Empire\", and were mostly used in extreme situations and mass casualty events.Given the various angles the skeletons now lie, the researchers say they were \"most probably thrown in\" the well before being covered with soil.Mursa has been of archaeological importance for years, with various ancient civilisation sites discovered in the area.",

The streets and subway entrances were densely packed with people holding up signs with slogans like, \"Democracy not Monarchy\" and \"The Constitution is not optional\".Ahead of the demonstrations, Trump allies accused the protesters of being linked with the far-left Antifa movement, and condemned what they called \"the hate America rally\".Organisers and protesters out on Saturday said the events were peaceful.Getty ImagesProtesters gather in New York City's Times SquareNon-violence is a core principle of No Kings events, the group states on its website, which urges all participants to de-escalate potential altercations. In New York, sections of the crowd regularly erupted into chants of \"this is what democracy looks like\" as a near-constant drumbeat boomed in the background alongside cowbells and noisemakers. Helicopters and drones could be seen flying overhead, and police stood on the sidelines.The NYPD said more than 100,000 people had gathered to peacefully protest across all five of the city's boroughs, and that no protest-related arrests were made. In Times Square, a police officer standing by estimated that over 20,000 were marching down 7th Avenue. Grace Eliza Goodwin/BBCThousands gathered in New York City's Times Square before marching downtownBeth Zasloff, a freelance writer and editor, said she had joined the New York protest because she feels outraged and distressed at what she called a \"move toward fascism and an authoritarian government\" happening in the Trump administration.\"I care a lot about New York City,\" Ms Zasloff said. \"It gives me hope to be out here with many, many other people.\"Grace Eliza Goodwin/BBCBeth Zasloff is protesting against Trump in New York CitySince returning to the White House, Trump has embraced an expansive view of presidential power, using executive orders to block funding approved by Congress and dismantle parts of the federal government, to introduce sweeping tariffs on other countries, and to deploy national guard troops to cities despite objections by state governors.The president says his actions are necessary to rebuild a country in crisis and he has dismissed claims he's a dictator or fascist as hysterical. But critics warn some of the moves by the administration are unconstitutional and a threat to American democracy.Massimo Mascoli, a 68-year-old retired electronic engineer and resident of New Jersey who grew up in Italy, said he was protesting because he is concerned the US is following the same path that his home country did in the last century. \"I am the nephew of an Italian hero that deserted the Mussolini army and joined the resistance,\" Mr Mascoli said. \"He was tortured and killed by the fascists, and after 80 years, I didn't expect to find fascism again in the United States.\"Grace Eliza Goodwin/BBCMassimo Mascoli is protesting in New York City against what he sees as a rise in fascism in the country Mr Mascoli is particularly concerned about the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, implementation of widespread tariffs, deployment of National Guard troops into US cities, and cuts to healthcare for millions of Americans. \"We cannot count on the Supreme Court, we cannot count on the government,\" Mr Mascoli said. \"We cannot count on the Congress. We have all the legislative, the executive and judiciary that are all against the American people right now. So we are fighting.\"Senate Minority Leader and New York Democrat Chuck Schumer also joined in the protest.\"We have no dictators in America. And we won't allow Trump to keep eroding our democracy,\" Schumer wrote on X alongside photos of himself holding up a sign that read \"fix the health care crisis\".Protests are expected to continue across the country throughout the day. In Washington DC, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders delivered a keynote speech.\"We're not here because we hate America, we're here because we love America,\" he said to a crowd of thousands.At the DC march, the BBC saw one man wearing a hat emblazoned with Trump's \"Make American Great Again\" slogan, who said he was in town to visit and decided to check out the protest. He declined to give his name, but said while he didn't really \"get it\", people had been civil. Shortly after, a woman shouted a derogatory comment at him.Throughout Europe, protesters took to the streets in Berlin, Madrid and Rome earlier on Saturday to show solidarity with their American counterparts. A couple of hundred protesters also gathered outside the US embassy in London. In Toronto, demonstrators near the US consulate general waved signs including \"Hands off Canada\".In an interview with Fox News, set to air on Sunday but teased on Saturday, Trump appeared to address the upcoming rallies.\"A king! This is not an act,\" Trump said in a preview clip of the interview. \"You know – they're referring to me as a king. I'm not a king.\"Getty ImagesA protest outside the US embassy in London\"We'll have to get the National Guard out,\" Kansas Senator Roger Marshall said ahead of the rallies, according to CNN. \"Hopefully it'll be peaceful. I doubt it.\"Republican governors in several US states have placed National Guard troops on standby, but it is unclear how visible the military presence there will be. Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Thursday activated the state's National Guard ahead of a protest scheduled in Austin, the state's capital. He said the troops would be needed due to the \"planned antifa-linked demonstration\".Democrats denounced the move, including the state's top Democrat Gene Wu, who argued: \"Sending armed soldiers to suppress peaceful protests is what kings and dictators do - and Greg Abbott just proved he's one of them.\"Virginia's Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin also ordered the state National Guard to be activated, though local reports said troops were not present during the protest.Getty ImagesIn Washington, DC, where the National Guard guard has been deployed since August at Trump's request, no troops were visible at the protest, although local police were.One protester at the rally in the capital held up a sign that read \"I am antifa\".Chuck Epes, 76, said it was a \"loaded\" term, and just meant he supported \"peace, daycare, liveable wage, healthcare\", as well as immigrants and people of colour.\"He's gaslighting everybody - or trying to, and it ain't working,\" he said.Getty ImagesA \"No Kings\" protest in Waxhaw, North CarolinaAmericans are deeply divided on Donald Trump. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that only 40% approved of his performance as president, while 58% disapproved. This puts him about on par with his average approval rating during his first term, but lower than his 47% approval rating when he took office for the second time in January.It is common for presidents to become more unpopular as their term wears on. Joe Biden had a 55% approval rating, according to Reuters/Ipsos, in January 2021. By October of that year, his approval had declined to 46%.With additional reporting by Ana FaguyGetty Images",

    "body": "1 day agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent in WarsawOmar Marques/Getty ImagesVolodymyr Zhuravlyov was released after the judge delivered his verdictA Polish judge has refused to extradite a Ukrainian citizen – suspected by Germany of sabotaging the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September 2022 – arguing that if Ukraine was responsible for the attack, then it was a \"just\" act.Volodymyr Zhuravlyov, who was brought to Warsaw District Court in handcuffs, was detained in Poland last month on a European arrest warrant.Judge Dariusz Lubowski ordered his release, after a ruling that was met with a ripple of surprise from the crowd in court and a smile from the man in the dock.Mr Zhuravlyov, along with others, is suspected of planting explosives deep beneath the Baltic Sea on the pipelines leading from Russia to Germany.Blame for the blasts, which crippled a long-controversial energy supply line from Russia to Germany, initially focused on Moscow until signs of Ukrainian involvement began to emerge. Officials in Kyiv have repeatedly denied any role.Extradition cases within the EU are usually quick and straightforward, but the Nord Stream case is proving to be very different.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, whose government is a key ally of war-torn Ukraine, immediately posted on X that the ruling was right. \"Case closed,\" he wrote.Diver held in Poland over Russian pipeline blasts in Baltic SeaUkrainian held in Italy over Nord Stream gas pipelines blast mysteryInside the giant district courthouse in Warsaw, Judge Lubowski announced his decision to the suspect, his family and legal team – and a large cluster of TV cameras.In a long and passionate speech, he said he was considering only the request to send Mr Zhuravlyov to Germany, not the substance of the case itself. But he was clear that the context of the war in Ukraine was critical.The judge described Russia's invasion as \"a bloody and genocidal attack\" and argued, quoting Aristotle and Saint Thomas Aquinas, that Ukraine had the legal right to defend itself.\"If Ukraine and its special forces… organised an armed mission to destroy enemy pipelines – which the court does not prejudge – then these actions were not unlawful. \"On the contrary, they were justified, rational and just,\" he told the court.BBC/Sarah RainsfordMr Zhuravlyov's wife, Yulianna, said it was important to hear the judge understood UkrainiansHe said the attack had \"deprived the enemy of billions of euros paid by Germany for the gas… and weakened Russia's military potential\".What could be seen as terrorism or sabotage in peace time, the judge said, was different in a time of war.Germany had in fact halted use of the two Nord Stream 1 pipelines after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Nord Stream 2 had not yet entered service.Poland has always been a vocal critic of that project for making Berlin too dependent on Moscow. The route deprived Poland of transit fees for the gas. Ukraine and the US were also longstanding opponents of the pipelines.Judge Lubowski insisted, though, that his ruling was a legal one, and not emotional or political. He also questioned whether Germany had jurisdiction even to bring its case, as the explosions were in international waters on pipelines with majority Russian state ownership.Announcing that Mr Zhuravlyov would be released from custody, he said the Ukrainian would also get compensation from the Polish state.\"I am happy… it was a really very hard three weeks,\" Mr Zhuravlyov's wife, Yulianna, told the BBC in court after the judge's verdict.\"For me, as a Ukrainian, it was very important to hear that he understands us.\"She said the family planned to stay in Poland, where they have lived since February 2022.Earlier, she described her husband's arrest at their home just outside Warsaw and said he denied any involvement in the sabotage.Volodymyr Zhuravlyov is a deep-sea diver, his wife has confirmed, but she called it a hobby and said he had no military role. He has a business in Poland installing air conditioners. Mrs Zhuravlyova could not tell the BBC exactly where her husband was when three of the four Nord Stream pipelines were blown up, because she said no-one had asked her to check.He is not the only suspect on Germany's list: another Ukrainian man was detained in Italy in August when he was on holiday. Serhiy Kuznetsov was also accused of \"unconstitutional sabotage\" and has denied any connection to the blasts. He is currently in a high security prison in northern Italy.A court in Bologna did rule he should be extradited to Berlin but earlier this week that verdict was annulled by the top appeals court in Rome and the case has been returned to Bologna to begin all over again.Asked about the decision, Germany's foreign minister said he respected the ruling and it was not the job of government to interfere with the courts.",

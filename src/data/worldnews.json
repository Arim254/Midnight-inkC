    "body": "2 days agoGrace Tsoi,BBC World ServiceandBBC News Chinese,Hong KongBBCJimmy Lai, 78, faces life in prison for national security offencesOn a winter morning in 2022 Raphael Wong and Figo Chan walked into Hong Kong's Stanley prison to meet Jimmy Lai, the media billionaire who had been arrested two years before and was awaiting trial charged with national security offences.They had all been part of the turbulent protests that had rocked Hong Kong in 2019, when hundreds of thousands took to the streets demanding democracy and more freedom in the Chinese territory. They would also often meet for dinner, sometimes lavish meals, gossiping and bantering over dim sum, pizza or claypot rice.In prison, he \"loved eating rice with pickled ginger,\" Chan said. \"No-one could have imagined Jimmy Lai would eat something like that!\"But neither had they imagined a reunion at a maximum security prison, the protests crushed, friends and fellow activists jailed, Hong Kong just as boisterous and yet, changed. And gone was the owner of the irreverent nickname \"Fatty Lai\": he had lost considerable weight.Decades apart - Lai in his 70s, Wong and Chan about 40 years younger - they had still dreamed of a different Hong Kong. Lai was a key figure in the protests, wielding his most influential asset, the hugely popular newspaper, Apple Daily, in the hope of shaping Hong Kong into a liberal democracy. That proved risky under a contentious national security law imposed in 2020 by China's Communist Party rulers in Beijing.Lai always said he owed Hong Kong. Although he is a UK citizen, he refused to leave. \"I got everything I have because of this place,\" he told the BBC hours before he was arrested in 2020. \"This is my redemption,\" he said, choking up.He wanted the city to continue to have the freedom it had given him. That's what drove his politics - fiercely critical of the Communist Party and avowedly supportive of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. It cost him his own freedom.Watch: Jimmy Lai's last interview as a free man in 2020Lai harboured \"a rabid hatred\" of the Chinese Communist Party and \"an obsession to change the Party's values to those of the Western world\", the High Court ruled on Monday as it delivered the verdict in his trial. It said that Lai had hoped the party would be ousted - or, at the very least, that its leader Xi Jinping would be removed.Lai was found guilty on all counts of charges he had always denied. The most serious one - colluding with foreign forces - carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.\"Never,\" Lai had said to that charge when he testified, arguing that he had only advocated for what he believed were Hong Kong's values: \"rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly\".Monday's verdict was welcomed by Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee, who said Lai had used his newspaper to \"wantonly create social conflicts\" and \"glorify violence\". The law, he added, never allows anyone to harm the country \"under the guise of human rights, democracy and freedom\".Getty ImagesLai's wife Teresa and son Shun-yan at court for Lai's verdict, along with Cardinal Joseph Zen, former bishop of Hong Kong who baptised Lai in 1997 Back in 2022, before Wong and Chan left the prison, Lai asked them to pray with him, to Wong's surprise.Lai's Catholic faith had deepened in solitary confinement - an arrangement he had requested, according to authorities. He prayed six hours a day and he made drawings of Christ, which he sent in the mail to friends. \"Even though he was suffering,\" Wong said, \"he didn't complain nor was he afraid. He was at peace.\"Peace was not what Jimmy Lai had pursued for much of his life - not when he fled China as a 12-year-old, not while he worked his way up the gruelling factory chain, not even after he became a famous Hong Kong tycoon, and certainly not as his media empire took on Beijing.For Lai, Hong Kong was everything that China was not - deeply capitalist, a land of opportunity and limitless wealth, and free. In the city, which was still a British colony when he arrived in 1959, he found success - and then a voice.Apple Daily became one of the top-selling papers almost instantly after its debut in 1995. Modelled on USA Today, it revolutionised the aesthetics and layout of newspapers, and kicked off a cut-throat price war.From a guide to hiring prostitutes in the \"adult section\" to investigative reports, to columns by economists and novelists, it was a \"buffet\" targeting \"a full range of readers\", said Francis Lee, a journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Former editors and employees spoke of Lai's encouragement - \"If you dared to do it, he would dare to let you do it\" - and his temper. One said he often swore.They describe him as unconventional, and as a visionary who wasn't afraid to bet on experiments. \"Even before the iPhone was launched, he kept saying mobile phones would be the future,\" recalled one of the paper's editors, adding that he was full of ideas. \"It was as if he asked us to create a new website every day.\"It had been the same when he owned a clothing label. \"He was not afraid of disrupting the industry, and he was not afraid of making enemies,\" said Herbert Chow, a former marketing director at a rival brand.That was both his making and undoing, Chow said: \"Otherwise, there would have been no Apple Daily. Of course, he wouldn't have ended up like this either.\"An early TV commercial for Apple Daily featured the then 48-year-old Lai biting the forbidden fruit while dozens of arrows took aim at him.It became a self-fulfilling prophecy.Jimmylai.substack.comThe Apple Daily commercial when it launched in 1995Escape from ChinaIt was his first taste of chocolate that beckoned Lai to Hong Kong as a boy.After carrying a passenger's luggage at a railway station in China, Lai was given a tip, and a bar of chocolate. He took a bite. \"I asked him where he's from. He said Hong Kong. I said, 'Hong Kong must be heaven' because I had never tasted anything like that,\" Lai said of the encounter in a 2007 documentary, The Call of the Entrepreneur.Life in Mao Zedong's China was punctuated by waves of oppressive campaigns - to industrialise China overnight, to weed out capitalist \"class enemies\". The Lais, once a family of business people, were blacklisted. His father fled to Hong Kong, leaving them behind. His mother was sent to a labour camp.Decades later, Lai wrote of how of he and his sisters would be dragged out of their homes to watch a crowd forcing their mother to kneel while she was shoved and taunted - cruel public shaming that soon became the norm. The first time, Lai wrote, was terrifying: \"My tears flowed freely and wet my shirt. I dared not make a move. My body was burning with humiliation.\"Uncowed, his grandmother finished every story with the same message: \"You have to become a businessman even if you only sell seasoned peanuts!\"And so, at the age of 12, he set off for Hong Kong, among millions who fled the mainland - and Mao's devastating rule - over the years.The day he arrived, on the bottom of a fishing boat, along with about 80 seasick travellers, he was hired by a mitten factory. He described the long working hours as a \"very happy time, a time that I knew I had a future\". It was there that one of his co-workers helped him learn English. Years later, he would give interviews and even testify at court in fluent English.By his early 20s, he was managing a textile factory and after making money on the stock market, he started his own, Comitex Knitters. He was 27.Getty ImagesJimmy Lai at his home in Hong Kong in 1993 Business often took Lai to New York, and on one of those trips, he was lent a book that came to define his worldview: The Road to Serfdom by Nobel Prize-winning economist Friedrich Hayek, a champion of free-market capitalism. \"People's spontaneous reaction\" and \"the exchange of information\" have created the best in the world, was his takeaway. To him, that was Hong Kong's strength.The book spurred a voracious reading habit. He would read the same book multiple times, and read every book by authors he admired.  \"I want to turn the author's thoughts into my backyard garden. I want to buy a garden, not cut flowers,\" he said in a 2009 interview.After a decade in manufacturing, he was \"bored\" and founded the clothing chain Giordano in 1981, which became a fast-fashion pioneer. It was so successful that Tadashi Yanai sought advice from Lai when his Japanese label Uniqlo opened shops.Lai launched stores in China, which had begun to open up after Mao died. He was \"excited\", China \"was going to be changed, like a Western country\", he said in the 2007 documentary.Then in 1989, Beijing crushed pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square: a rude awakening for Lai and Hong Kong, which was set to return to Chinese rule in 1997 under a recent agreement by China and the UK.Giordano sold tees with photos of Tiananmen protest leaders and anti-Beijing slogans, and put up pro-democracy banners in stores across Hong Kong.A million people marched in Hong Kong in solidarity with student protesters in Beijing. Until 2020, Hong Kong held the largest vigil that mourned the massacre.Lai said later that he \"didn't feel anything about China\" until then. He had always wanted to forget that part of his life but \"all of a sudden, it was like my mother was calling in the darkness of the night\".Getty ImagesLai was a frequent attendee at Hong Kong 's annual vigils in memory of those who died at Tiananmen Square in 1989'Choice is freedom'The following year Lai launched a magazine called Next, and in 1994 published an open letter to Li Peng, \"the Butcher of Beijing\" who played a key role in the Tiananmen massacre. He called him \"the son of a turtle egg with zero intelligence\".Beijing was furious. Between 1994 and 1996, Giordano's flagship store in Beijing and 11 franchises in Shanghai closed. Lai sold his shares and stepped down as chairman.\"If I just go on making money, it doesn't mean anything to me. But if I go into the media business, then I deliver information, which is choice, and choice is freedom,\" Lai said in the 2007 documentary.He soon became a \"very active participant\" in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, meeting leaders to discuss strategy, said Lee Wing Tat, a former lawmaker from the Democratic Party.He became an outspoken critic of the CCP, writing in 1994: \"I entirely oppose the Communist Party because I hate everything that restrains personal liberties.\" He also started to voice concerns about the looming handover of Hong Kong, from Britain to China, in 1997. \"After more than a century of colonial rule, Hong Kongers feel proud to return to the embrace of the motherland,\" he wrote. \"But should we love the motherland even if it doesn't have freedom?\"During the handover, however, China's then-leader Jiang Zemin promised that Hongkongers would govern Hong Kong and the city would have a high degree of autonomy for the next 50 years.Getty ImagesLai at an \"Occupy Central\" protest in Admiralty in October 2014The 2014 Umbrella Movement sparked by Beijing's refusal to allow completely free elections in Hong Kong became another turning point for Lai.Protesters occupied the city's main commercial districts for 79 days. Lai turned up from 9am to 5pm every day, undeterred after a man threw animal entrails at him. \"When the police started firing tear gas, I was with Fatty,\" the former lawmaker Lee recalled.The movement ended when the court ordered protest sites to be cleared, but the government did not budge. Five years later, in 2019, Hong Kong erupted again, this time because of a controversial plan that would have allowed extradition to mainland China.What began as peaceful marches became increasingly violent, turning the city into a battleground for six months. Black-clad protesters threw bricks and Molotov cocktails, stormed parliament and started fires; riot police fired tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons and live rounds.Lai was at the forefront of the protests and served 20 months for participating in four unauthorised assemblies. A protester told the BBC he was surprised to see Lai: \"To me, he's a busy businessman, but he showed up.\"Getty ImagesLai at a pro-democracy march in 2019 Apple Daily provided blanket coverage or, as critics would argue, a sounding board for an anti-government movement.Government adviser Ronny Tong said Lai was \"instrumental\" in the protests because Apple Daily carried a \"totally false\" slogan – anti-extradition to China – which \"caught the imagination of people who wanted to cause havoc in Hong Kong\".Whether Apple Daily played a seditious role, and how much control Lai exerted over its stance was at the centre of his 156-day national security trial.Lai instructed the editorial team to \"urge people to take to the streets\", according to Cheung Kim-hung, former chief executive of Apple Daily's parent company Next Digital, and a defendant-turned-prosecution witness. After the National Security Law took effect, the newspaper was raided twice and eventually shut down in 2021.During the height of the protests, Lai flew to the US where he met then Vice-President Mike Pence to discuss the situation in Hong Kong. A month before the National Security Law was imposed, Lai launched a controversial campaign, despite internal pushback, urging Apple Daily readers to send letters to then US President Donald Trump to \"save Hong Kong\".All of this, the court ruled, amounted to a public appeal for a foreign government to interfere in Hong Kong's internal affairs.\"Nobody in their right mind should think that Hong Kong can undergo any kind of political reform without at least tacit acceptance from Beijing,\" Tong said. The protests in 2014 and 2019 \"are totally against common sense\".Getty ImagesCopies of the last Apple Daily newspaper early on June 24, 2021Beijing says Hong Kong has now moved from \"chaos to governance\" and onto \"greater prosperity\" because of the national security law and a \"patriot-only\" parliament. But critics, including hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers who have since left, say dissent has been stifled, and the city's freedoms severely curbed.Lee, the lawmaker, is among them: \"When I first came to the UK, I had nightmares. I felt very guilty. Why could we live in other places freely, while our good friends were jailed?\"Lai's family has been calling for his release for years, citing concerns for his health because he is diabetic, but their calls have been rejected so far. The government and Lai's Hong Kong legal team have said that his medical needs are being met.Carmen Tsang, Lai's daughter-in-law who lives in Hong Kong with her family, says her children miss grandpa - and the big family dinners he hosted every two weeks. His loud voice scared her daughter when she was younger, but \"they loved going to grandpa's place… They think he's a funny guy\".She is not sure today's Hong Kong has a place for Lai. \"If there's a speck of dust in your eye, you just get rid of it, right?\"Watch: What does the Jimmy Lai verdict mean for democracy in Hong Kong?",

    "body": "11 minutes agoAlex BoydandLaura GozziBBC Russia Editor Steve Rosenberg on scene of Moscow car bombingA Russian general has been killed in a car bombing in Moscow, officials have said.Russia's Investigative Committee said Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov died on Monday morning after an explosive device planted under a car detonated.Sarvarov, 56, was the head of the armed forces' operational training department, the committee added.It said one theory being investigated was that the bomb was planted with the involvement of Ukrainian intelligence services. Ukraine has not commented.Sarvarov died in hospital as a result of his injuries, the committee said, adding it had opened an investigation into murder and illegal trafficking of explosives.Investigators have been sent to the scene, in a car park near an apartment block in the south of Russia's capital.Images from the area show a badly damaged white car with the doors blown out, surrounded by other vehicles. According to Russian media, Sarvarov previously took part in combat operations during the Ossetian-Ingush conflict and the Chechen wars in the 1990s and early 2000s, and also led operations in Syria between 2015-2016. ReutersInvestigators could be seen working at the scene on Monday morningVladimir Putin was informed of Sarvarov's death immediately, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a number of military officials and high-profile individuals have been targeted in the Russian capital.Darya Dugina, the 29-year-old daughter of a prominent nationalist figure and Putin close ally, was killed in a suspected car bombing in 2022.Gen Yaroslav Moskalik was killed in a car bomb attack last April, while Gen Igor Kirillov died in December 2024 when a device hidden in a scooter was detonated remotely.A Ukrainian source later told the BBC that Kirillov was killed by Ukraine's security service, though this was never confirmed on the record. As a matter of policy, Ukraine never officially admits or claims responsibility for targeted attacks.",

    "body": "US and Ukrainian envoys say \"productive and constructive\" talks have taken place in Miami, but there still appears to be no major breakthrough in efforts to end Ukraine's war with Russia.Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, issued a joint statement with the top Ukrainian negotiator, Rustem Umerov, after three days of meetings with European allies.The pair said the meeting focused on aligning positions on a 20-point plan, a \"multilateral security guarantee framework\", a \"US Security guarantee framework for Ukraine\" and an \"economic & prosperity plan\". Separate talks have been taking place in Miami between the US and the Russian envoy, Kirill Dmitriev.\"Our shared priority is to stop the killing, ensure guaranteed security, and create conditions for Ukraine's recovery, stability, and long-term prosperity,\" Witkoff and Umerov said in a statement.The meetings are the latest step in weeks of diplomatic activity, sparked by the leaking of a 28-point US peace plan which shocked Ukraine and its European allies for appearing to favour Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago.Witkoff said representatives from Russia had met himself and other US officials in southern Florida, including Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.Witkoff said the meetings with Russian envoy Dmitriev were also \"productive and constructive\" and that \"Russia remains fully committed to achieving peace in Ukraine\". Trump has been pushing Ukraine and Russia to come to an agreement on ending the war, but so far the two countries have been unable to agree on major issues, including Moscow's demand to keep land it has already seized.US intelligence reports continue to warn that Russian President Vladimir Putin still wants to capture all of Ukraine and reclaim parts of Europe that belonged to the former Soviet empire, six sources familiar with US intelligence told the Reuters news agency.This comes says after Putin told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg that there will be no more wars after Ukraine, if Russia is treated with respect.\"There won't be any operations if you treat us with respect, if you respect our interests just as we've always tried to respect yours,\" he said.Meanwhile, a Ukrainian drone attack damaged two vessels and two piers in Russia's southern Krasnodar region, Russian officials said on Monday. The damage led to a big fire, but Russian authorities say all crew were safely evacuated.  Some reports say oil infrastructure was targeted.",

    "body": "10 hours agoAbu Bakar YasinandNaomi Clarke,BBC NewsbeatGetty ImagesThe Fulham midfielder will represent his home country Nigeria in the competitionHe's played on some of the biggest stages in the world in the Premier League, but Alex Iwobi believes the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) is a \"special\" experience. The tournament will see 24 teams battling for the continental crown across the next couple of weeks. Fulham midfielder Iwobi will represent his home country of Nigeria in the competition, where they will be hoping to clinch the title after missing out in a 2-1 loss to Ivory Coast in 2023's final.\"With Afcon, you get to celebrate Africa through football,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat. \"You get to see different cultures, you get to see how different people dress, how people from Nigeria, the way we walk into the changing rooms.\"When some of the other countries walk into the changing rooms, we play music, so we're celebrating our music through that as well.\"Nigeria will be hoping to redeem themselves after failing to qualify for a second successive World Cup. Iwobi says it was a \"big disappointment\", but the team will be using it to fuel them in the Afcon tournament.\"We owe it to ourselves to make it right, and there's no better way from the last Afcon to improve (than) just to win this one,\" the 29-year-old says. Afcon is typically held every two years and this time Morocco is hosting. Nigeria have won the competition three times over the years, the last being back in 2013. Their most recent loss to Ivory Coast is still prominent in Iwobi's mind as he says it \"shattered\" their dreams. However, he feels the moment was \"written\" for striker Sébastien Haller, who scored the winning goal after overcoming testicular cancer. \"It was a tough loss, but you give credit when credit due, they deserved it,\" Iwobi says.\"But it's also fuelled us and we've been working hard to get into the Afcon again and, hopefully, this is our story.\"Getty ImagesAlex Iwobi made his debut for Nigeria's national team in 2015The Fulham midfielder was born in Lagos, but moved to London as a child. His talent was spotted early and he was selected to represent England up to under-18 level.After many years with the Three Lions, he made his debut for Nigeria's national team in 2015 as he says he felt more \"at home\" with the team.\"England treated me with a lot of respect and they loved me,\" he says. \"But at the same time, I felt more of a connection with my roots in Nigeria.\"He has since made 91 appearances, making him the fourth most capped player for the Nigerian Super Eagles. Iwobi says he never thought he would play for Arsenal, Fulham, or Nigeria growing up, but he is \"honoured and grateful\" for his achievements. Ademola Lookman, Calvin Bassey and Iwobi's school friend Ola Aina are also among the players on the Nigerian national team who were not raised in the country.They have been affectionately nicknamed the \"innit boys\", and Iwobi hopes they have helped open the door for others to represent their home country. \"You're Nigerian at the end of the day and you will get loved regardless,\" he says.Getty ImagesIwobi says he never thought we would play for Arsenal, Fulham, or Nigeria in his careerThere has been debate over whether Afcon gets the respect it deserves.Earlier this year, Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher caused a stir when he suggested Afcon was not considered a \"major tournament\", when discussing Mohamed Salah's chances of winning the coveted Ballon d'Or.Iwobi feels there is still more work to be done.\"It's obviously getting recognised a lot more,\" he says. \"There's a lot of great talents, great nations representing.\"In the Premier League there's a lot of players in each team that are going to be represented so the awareness is growing, but it definitely deserves a lot more respect, in my opinion.\"If he wins the tournament, the Fulham player says he will be on the phone to his parents and sister straight away, while his extended family will be dancing.\"I've heard from previous people that when they win it, it's like everything just stops, you become like a king, you're just royalty,\" he says. \"Just going to the final we got treated like royalty anyway, so I can't imagine winning it.\"It would just be crazy, but I want to experience that.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "12 minutes agoJosh MartinBusiness reporterThe gold price has hit another record high, trading above $4,400 (£3,275) an ounce for the first time.The price of the precious metal has risen on expectations the US central bank will cut interest rates further next year, analysts said.Gold started the year worth $2,600 an ounce, but geopolitical tensions, the Trump tariffs and expectations of rate cuts have added to investor demand for safe haven assets, such as gold and other commodities.The prices of other precious metals, such as silver and platinum, have also risen.The spot price of gold hit a high of $4,420 on Monday before slipping back.The gold price has risen more than 68% this year, the highest increase since 1979, according to Adrian Ash, director of research at gold bullion marketplace BullionVault.2025 has seen \"slow-burning trends around interest rates, around war and trade tensions\", Mr Ash said, which have helped to push up the price of gold.\"The precious metals market says that President Trump has really triggered something – and gold has gone crazy this year.\"You've got the trade war, the attacks on the US Federal Reserve and you've got geopolitical tensions, all of those provocations come from Trump,\" he said.Lower interest rate expectations typically mean lower returns for investments such as bonds, so investors look to commodities such as gold and silver to get a return, but also diversify their portfolios.The consensus among analysts currently is that the US will lower interest rates twice in 2026.Another factor adding to demand is that central banks globally are expanding their own physical holdings of gold as a way to counter economic turbulence, reduce reliance on the US dollar, and diversify their own portfolios, according to analysis from Goldman Sachs, which predicted the pattern would continue in 2026.The steady increase in the price of gold across the year could be because it is seen as a way for traders to help shield themselves from the threat of inflation and economic turmoil, Anita Wright, chartered financial planner at Ribble Wealth Management, said.\"When confidence in financial assets and policy stability starts to wobble, gold tends to respond first as the primary monetary metal,\" Ms Wright said.A weaker US dollar has also helped push gold prices higher by making the metal cheaper for overseas buyers.Other precious metals have also had record years. The price of silver also hit a record of $69.44 an ounce on Monday.For 2025 so far, silver is up 138% year-to-date and platinum is at a 17-year high, vastly outperforming gold, underpinned by strong and supply constraints, according to analysts. Unlike gold, the other precious metals are also used widely in industrial manufacturing which helps stoke demand.Separately, oil prices rose on Monday, after the US ordered a \"blockade\" last week of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving the country.The price of Brent crude rose 53 cents to $60.99 a barrel, while US oil was up 1.6% to $57.40. However, both measures look set to end 2025 at prices lower than where they started the year.",

    "body": "In rebel-held Myanmar, civilians face devastating air strikes and a sham election14 hours agoYogita LimayeSouth Asia and Afghanistan correspondent in MyanmarAamir Peerzada/BBCSome Burmese refugees who fled Chin state are now taking shelter across the border in IndiaLate one night last month Iang Za Kim heard explosions in a neighbouring village, then fighter jets flying overhead. She ran out of her home to see smoke rising from a distance.\"We were terrified. We thought the junta's planes would bomb us too. So we grabbed what we could – some food and clothes and ran into the jungles surrounding our village.\"Iang's face quivers as she recounts the story of what happened on 26 November in K-Haimual, her village in Myanmar's western Chin State, and then she breaks down.She's among thousands of civilians who've fled their homes in recent weeks after the Burmese military launched a fierce campaign of air strikes, and a ground offensive in rebel-held areas across the country, to recapture territory ahead of elections starting on 28 December.Four other women sitting around her on straw mats also start crying. The trauma of what they've gone through to make it to safety is clearly visible.While the air strikes were the immediate cause for Iang to flee, she also doesn't want to be forced to participate in the election.\"If we are caught and refuse to vote, they will put us in jail and torture us. We've run away so that we don't have to vote,\" she says.Aamir Peerzada/BBCIang Za Kim had to flee her home after the junta launched air strikes nearbySome from Chin state have described the junta's latest offensive as the fiercest it has launched in more than three years.Many of the displaced have sought refuge in other parts of the state. Iang is among a group that crossed the border into India's Mizoram state. Currently sheltered in a rundown badminton court in Vaphai village, the group's few belongings they were able to carry are packed in plastic sacks.Indian villagers have given them food and basic supplies.Ral Uk Thang has had to flee his home at the age of 80, living in makeshift shelters in jungles for days, before finally making it to safety.\"We're afraid of our own government. They are extremely cruel. Their military has come into our and other villages in the past, they've arrested people, tortured them, and burned down homes,\" he says.It isn't easy to speak to Burmese civilians freely. Myanmar's military government does not allow free access in the country for foreign journalists. It took over the country in a coup in February 2021, shortly after the last election, and has since been widely condemned for running a repressive regime that has indiscriminately targeted civilians as it looks to crush the armed uprising against it across Myanmar.During its latest offensive, the junta last week targeted a hospital in Rakhine State, just south of Chin State. Rebel groups in Rakhine say at least 30 people were killed and more than 70 injured.The Chin Human Rights Organisation says that since mid-September at least three schools and six churches in Chin State have been targeted by junta airstrikes, killing 12 people including six children.The BBC has independently verified the bombing of a school in Vanha village on 13 October. Two students –Johan Phun Lian Cung, who was seven, and Zing Cer Mawi, 12 - were killed as they were attending lessons. The bombs ripped through their classrooms injuring more than a dozen other students.Myanmar's military government did not respond to the BBC's questions about the allegations.This is the second time Bawi Nei Lian and his young family – a wife and two young children - have been displaced. Back in 2021, soon after the coup, their home in Falam town was burnt down in an air strike. They rebuilt their lives in K-Haimual village. Now they're homeless again.\"I can't find the words to explain how painful and hard it is and what a difficult decision it was to make to leave. But we had to do it to stay alive,\" he says.\"I want the world to know that what the military is claiming – that this election is free and fair – this is absolutely false. When the main political party is not being allowed to contest the election, how can there be genuine democracy?\"Aamir Peerzada/BBCBawi Nei Lian (left) says the scheduled elections are a shamThe National League for Democracy party, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, which won landslides in the two elections prior to the coup, will not be contesting as most of its senior leaders including  Suu Kyi are in jail.\"We don't want the election. Because the military does not know how to govern our country. They only work for the benefit of their high-ranking leaders. When Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's party was in power, we experienced a bit of democracy. But now all we do is cry and shed tears,\" says Ral Uk Thang.Iang Za Kim believes the election will be rigged. \"If we voted for a party not allied with the military, I believe they will steal our votes and claim we voted for them.\"The election will take place in phases, with a result expected around the end of January. Rebel groups have called it a sham.At the base of the Chin National Front in Myanmar, the most prominent rebel group operating in the state, the group's Vice Chairman Sui Khar says: \"This election is only being held to prolong military dictatorship. It's not about the people's choice. And in Chin State, they hardly control much area, so how can they hold an election?\"He points out the areas where the most intense fighting is ongoing on a map and tells us nearly 50 rebel fighters have been injured in just the past month. There have been deaths too, but so far the groups have not released a number.\"There are columns of hundreds of soldiers trying to advance into the northern part of Chin state from four directions,\" Sui Khar says. \"The soldiers are being supported by air strikes, artillery fire and by drone units.\"Aamir Peerzada/BBCAbel lost his right leg and his hands were severely wounded fighting against the juntaAccess to the base is extremely rare. Set amid thickly forested mountains, it is the heart of the resistance against the junta in Chin state.Sui Khar takes us to the hospital at the base. We see a group of injured fighters who were brought in overnight and had to undergo hours of surgery. Some of them have had to undergo amputations.Many of them were just schoolboys when the coup occurred in 2021. Just about adults now, they've let go of their dreams to fight on the frontline against the junta.Abel, 18, is in too much pain to speak. He was with a group of fighters trying to take back territory the junta captured a week ago. They won the battle, but Abel lost his right leg and has serious injuries to his hands as well.In a bed next to him is Si Si Maung, 19, who's also had a leg amputated.\"As the enemy was retreating we ran forward and I stepped on a landmine. We were injured in the explosion. Then we were attacked from the air. The airstrikes make things very difficult for us,\" he says. \"I've lost a leg, but even if I've to give up my life I'm happy to make the sacrifice so that future generations have a better life.\"The impact of the ferocity of the latest offensive is visible in room after room at the hospital.Yet, it's the support and grit of tens of thousands of youngsters like Si Si Maung, who picked up arms to fight against the junta, that have helped the rebels make rapid advances against a much more powerful rival in the past four-and-a-half years.Some like 80-year-old Ral Uk Thang hope that after the election, the junta will retreat, and he will be able to go back home.\"But I don't think I will live to see democracy restored in Myanmar,\" he says. \"I hope my children and grandchildren can witness it some day.\"Additional reporting by Aamir Peerzada, Sanjay Ganguly and Aakriti Thapar",

    "body": "Officials from Thailand and Cambodia will meet next week to discuss the possibility of reviving a ceasefire, Thailand's foreign minister said, as deadly border clashes entered a third week. Both countries had signed a ceasefire earlier in July, brokered by US President Donald Trump. But fighting broke out again earlier this month - which both countries have blamed each other for. On Monday, top officials from both countries met at a summit in Malaysia, their first first face-to-face meeting since fighting resumed.Speaking afterwards, Thailand's Foreign Minister said the July ceasefire was \"rushed\", saying it was because the US \"wanted the declaration signed in time for Trump's [visit]\".\"We were sometimes in a rush because the US wanted it signed by the visit of President Trump,\" said Sihasak Phuangketkeow.\"But sometimes we really just [need to] sit down, trash things [out]...  make sure that the ceasefire reflects... the situation on the ground. And the ceasefire is one that really holds.\"Mr Phuangketkeow said a meeting between military officials from both Thailand and Cambodia would take place on 24 December, and that this would need to happen before any ceasefire agreement could be reached. Cambodia has yet to comment on the matter. At least 41 people have been killed and almost one million displaced since the renewed fighting this month. Both countries have blamed each other for the fresh hostilities. The most recent fighting has seen the exchange of artillery fire along the 800km (500-mile) border. Thailand has also launched air strikes targetting Cambodian positions.At the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) meeting on Monday, Malaysia's foreign minister had asked both sides and other Asean members to give the matter \"our most urgent attention\".\"We must consider the wider ramifications of the continued escalation of the situation for the people we serve,\" Mohamad Hasan told his counterparts, according to news agency AFP.The conflict has been the worst between Asean member states since the association was founded in 1967. The failure to contain it represents a serious blow to the bloc's credibility.The US and China have also been attempting to mediate a new ceasefire.China's special envoy for Asian affairs, Deng Xijun, visited Phnom Penh last week. A statement from Beijing said he reaffirmed that China would continue to play a constructive role in facilitating dialogue between Cambodia and Thailand.On Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at the daily press briefing that China had been mediating the confict in its own way since fighting restarted this month. He added that Beijing would release information on the mediation conducted by Deng \"in due course\".The argument between Thailand and Cambodia dates back more than a century, and there have been sporadic clashes, with soldiers and civilians killed on both sides over the years. But in May, tensions ramped up after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash. And on  24 July, the situation dramatically escalated after a Cambodian rocket barrage into Thailand, which was followed by Thai air strikes. That set off five days of intense fighting, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead.The two countries later agreed to an \"immediate and unconditional ceasefire\" brokered by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and US President Donald Trump - who at the time threatened to stop tariff negotiations until the hostilities stopped.The US president later oversaw the signing of what he dubbed \"the Kuala Lumpar peace accord\" in October. Thailand refused to call it that - instead referring to it as \"Joint Declaration by the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia on the outcomes of their meeting in Kuala Lumpur\".But that ceasefire fell apart in December, with both sides blaming each other for re-igniting the fighting, which has seen air strikes and exchanges of artillery fire.Additional reporting by Jonathan Head and Thanyarat Doksone",

    "body": "Watch: Images, cassettes and high-profile figures - What's in the latest Epstein files?A pair of US lawmakers have threatened legal action against US Attorney General Pam Bondi, after her deadline to release all government files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was met only in part. The release of the Department of Justice (DoJ) documents was highly anticipated but in the end, only a portion of the available material was made public.A leading campaigner on the issue, Republican congressman Thomas Massie, said he could try to bring contempt proceedings against the attorney general as a result.The DoJ insists it is complying with its legal obligations, and Bondi herself has said she is part of \"the most transparent administration in American history\".The phrase \"Epstein files\" refer to the trove of information that was amassed by the US justice department during its two criminal investigations into Epstein.A law that compelled the release of the full trove was signed by US President Donald Trump in November, after pressure from his supporters and members of his own Republican Party. Friday was the deadline for the release of the material. Although some material was released, there were many redactions and other information was withheld - which angered Massie and his allies, as well as survivors of Epstein's abuse. Trump himself is yet to comment.The DoJ has said that more material will follow in the coming weeks. But speaking to CBS programme Face the Nation on Sunday, Massie suggested that the justice department was \"flouting the spirit and the letter of the law\".He went on to say: \"The quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi, and that doesn't require going through the courts.\"Inherent contempt is a little-used legal recourse that can be used by either the Senate or House - the upper and lower chambers of Congress respectively - which has not been invoked for nearly a century, according to the American Bar Association.Massie added that \"Ro Khanna and I are talking about and drafting that right now\", referring to a Democratic congressman who has also been prominent in the campaign for the release of the full Epstein files.Speaking to the same programme, Khanna gave further detail on how the contempt proceedings could work. \"We're building a bipartisan coalition, and it would fine Pam Bondi for every day that she's not releasing these documents,\" he said.Unlike an impeachment effort - another option that would be theoretically available to critics of Bondi - the contempt move would only require support from the House of Representatives, Massie pointed out. Bondi's deputy Todd Blanche was defiant during an interview with another broadcaster on Sunday.Asked by the Meet the Press programme on NBC News whether he took threats from Congress members seriously, the deputy attorney general said: \"Not even a little bit. Bring it on. We are doing everything we're supposed to be doing to comply with the statute.\"Blanche pointed to the magnitude of the task. \"You're talking about a million or so pages of documents,\" he said. \"Virtually all of them contain victim information.\" He continued: \"And if by complying with the statute we don't produce everything on Friday, we produce things next week and the week after, that's still compliance with the statute.\"Speaking to the same programme, another member of Khanna's party, Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, said contempt or impeachment efforts would be \"premature\".\"We have tools in appropriations bills and other tools to force compliance if somebody is dragging their feet and I'd rather focus on those tools,\" Kaine said.Blanche said elsewhere on Sunday that certain Epstein-related files that were originally released on Friday were later removed by the DoJ from its website because of concerns raised by victims.One of those files - an image featuring Trump - was later reinstated after review, said Blanche.",

    "body": "37 minutes agoVanessa BuschschlüterandSeher AsafKristi Noem via X/ReutersA second oil tanker was seized by the US Coast Guard on SaturdayThe US Coast Guard is in \"active pursuit\" of a vessel in international waters near Venezuela as tensions in the region continue to escalate.US authorities have already seized two oil tankers this month - one of them on Saturday. Sunday's pursuit related to a \"sanctioned dark fleet vessel that is part of Venezuela's illegal sanctions evasion\", a US official told the BBC's partner CBS News. \"It is flying a false flag and under a judicial seizure order.\"The Trump administration has accused Venezuela of using oil money to fund drug-related crime, while Venezuela has described the tanker seizures as \"piracy\".According to the New York Times (NYT), late on Saturday the US Coast Guard approached an oil tanker, which US officials said was not flying a valid national flag.British maritime risk management group Vanguard identified the tanker as Bella 1, a very large crude oil carrier which reportedly was on its way to Venezuela to pick up oil.  The US added the Bella 1 to its sanctions list last year for allegedly \"carrying sanctioned cargo\". When it added the Bella 1 to its sanctions list, the US Treasury Department accused its registered owner of having links to Iran and of providing support Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The NYT reports the tanker \"did not submit to being boarded\" and fled northeast into the Atlantic Ocean with the US Cost Guard in pursuit. The Bella 1 is the third oil tanker to be targeted by the US in waters off Venezuela. On 10 December, the Coast Guard seized the Skipper, which US Attorney General Pam Bondi said was \"used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela to Iran\".The Skipper has since been taken under escort to Galveston in Texas, where it arrived on Sunday. On Saturday, Coast Guard personnel boarded a tanker with the name Centuries written on its side. While the Centuries does not appear on the US Treasury's list of sanctioned vessels, the White House said that it carried oil from Venezuela's state-run oil company, PDVSA.US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that the Centuries was \"operating as part of the Venezuelan shadow fleet to traffic stolen oil and fund the narcoterrorist Maduro regime\".The seizure of the tankers is the latest development in the US's pressure campaign against the government of Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro.Since Trump returned into office in January, the US has doubled the reward it offers for information leading to Maduro's capture, declared his government a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) and last week, ordered a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving the country.As the Venezuelan government relies heavily on profits from oil exports to finance its spending, this latest move has caused particular outrage with Venezuelan officials. While President Maduro did not refer to the seizure of the Centuries or the pursuit of the Bella 1 directly, he denounced US actions as \"piracy\" in comments he made on Sunday. Maduro has also accused the US of trying to seize Venezuela's oil riches - the South American country has the world's largest proven oil reserves. At Venezuela's request, the United Nations Security will hold an emergency session on Tuesday to discuss what Caracas has described as \"ongoing US aggression\".China on Monday appeared to side with Venezuela with a spokesperson for the  foreign ministry denouncing \"unilateral and illegal sanctions that lack a basis in international law or authorisation by the United Nations Security Council\".The spokesperson added that \"Venezuela has the right to develop independently and engage in a mutually beneficial cooperation with other nations\".More on this story",

    "body": "21 hours agoJaroslav LukivandMayeni Jones,JohannesburgA manhunt is under way after a shooting at a tavern in South Africa left nine people dead and another 10 injured. Police said seven men and two women were killed in Bekkersdal, near Johannesburg, after about 12 unidentified gunmen arrived in two vehicles and opened fire at patrons. The shooting happened at about 01:00 local time on Sunday (23:00 GMT Saturday) and the perpetrators \"continued to shoot randomly as [people] fled the scene\", police added. South Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world. Sixty-three people were killed every day on average between April and September this year, according to police figures. Murders are often the result of arguments, robberies and gang violence. The motive for this attack is not clear.At the scene, deputy provincial police commissioner Maj-Gen Fred Kekana told  broadcaster Newzroom Afrika that the perpetrators, armed with pistols and one AK-47, were \"unprovoked\".\"The poor patrons were just enjoying themselves when people came and shot,\" he said. Two of the victims were shot outside the tavern as they tried to flee and a third was a taxi driver who had dropped off a passenger nearby, Maj-Gen Kekana added.Resident Nokuthula Bhukwana went to the tavern after she heard the shooting. \"When we arrived at the scene, we opened the doors and indeed scores of people were lying on the floor,\" she told the Reuters news agency.\"We rushed around and others were calling the police, and we also called the ambulance and they arrived. We had to carry some of the injured people using wheelbarrows to the clinic.\"Speaking to Newzroom Afrika, one resident described how gunfire had become a normal thing at night in Bekkersdal.\"Criminals, they do as they please here,\" the unnamed man said. \"These guns, they sound each and every evening... as soon as it's dusk we know that gunshots are about to sound and they will sound severely.\"It is terrorising our communities.\"Interviewed at the scene, deputy mayor for the local municipality Nontombi Molatlhegi said that locals were afraid of speaking out and identifying those responsible.She said that the police were under-resourced, and too thinly spread, and called for the military to get involved in protecting residents.\"We are crying, as well as the city political leadership, for the intervention of the national government to release [the army] so that they can be able to come in this space\" and be visible.There are about three million legally held firearms in South Africa, but there are at least the same number of unlicensed weapons in circulation in the country, which has a population of 63 million, according to statistics cited by Gideon Joubert from the South African Gunowners' Association.Earlier this month, at least 11 people - including a child - were shot dead at a hostel near Pretoria.There has been a significant increase in mass shootings - where four or more people are either killed or injured - since 2020, Claire Taylor, a researcher at campaign group Gun Free South Africa, told the BBC.Looking at media reports from 2024 her organisation recorded 80 such incidents, which was up from 71 the previous year. There has, however, been a decline in reported mass shootings in 2025.Among the most common locations are licensed taverns, such as in Bekkersdal this weekend, or illegal drinking spots, known locally as shebeens, which was the case in the 6 December killings.Additional reporting by Damian Zane",

    "body": "Civil rights groups and pro-gun advocates in Australia have raised concerns that new fast-tracked laws will place undue restrictions on firearms and protests in the wake of the Bondi shootings.On Monday, the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) recalled its parliament to debate a raft of new laws such as banning the phrase \"globalise the intifada\", limiting the number of guns one person can own, and greater police powers for protests.NSW Premier Chris Minns said some may feel the changes had \"gone too far\" but they were needed to keep the community safe.A pro-gun politician said the laws unfairly target law-abiding gun owners while civil libertarians said restrictions on protests were an affront to democracy.On banning the \"intifada\" phrase, Minns said its use at protests in Australia and around the world \"are a call to a global intifada. That is what it means. Not in the Middle East, not in Israel or Gaza but here in Sydney\".\"I do believe it leads to a culture and environment of heightened disunity,\" he said, and \"an invitation to violence\".The term intifada came into popular use during the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1987.Some have described the term as a call for violence against Jewish people. Others have said it is a call for peaceful resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and actions in Gaza.In the aftermath of the Bondi attacks, in which 15 people were killed, the Jewish community accused the government of not doing enough to protect it from rising antisemitism.The new protest laws will also allow police to restrict demonstrations at places of worship, with stronger penalties for breaches.Timothy Roberts, president of the NSW Council for Civil Liberties, said the new law ignores a recent decision by the state's supreme court which found the so-called \"move-on power\" at religious locations went against Australia's implied constitutional freedom of political communication.Religious institutions exercise significant and overt political power in Australian politics and this makes them a legitimate site of protest in a democratic society, Mr Roberts said. \"The laws introduced today are an affront to our right to assemble and communicate with each other,\" he said, adding they \"damage our democracy\".He said Minns wants social cohesion but he does not know the meaning of the term. \"He thinks silence is peace, and does not seem to realise it can also reflect oppression. Passing laws that oppress some parts of our community in the wake of an attack like we saw, does not bring us closer - it drives us further apart and stops us from healing well in this time of grief.\"Police will also be able to remove face coverings from protesters who are suspected of committing an offence - including low-level offences - during a protest. Previously, police could only do so if someone is arrested or suspected of committing an indictable offence. On gun reform, the new laws will mean licence holders in NSW cannot own more than four firearms with exceptions for farmers and sport shooters who can have up to ten. The move follows similar laws introduced in Western Australia earlier this year to cap gun ownership. Elsewhere across the country, there are no limits.One of the gunmen in the Bondi shooting, Sajid Akram, had six registered firearms. Other gun law changes include more regular renewals for gun licence holders from every five years to every two years, and a review of the types of firearms available to most gun owners.Mark Banasiak from the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party - which lobbies for more relaxed gun laws - said the state's 260,000 gun licence holders were being \"punished\" and \"made a scapegoat for agency failings\".\"We're diverting away from what the real problem is,\" he said, referring to \"a climate of hate and division that's been allowed to fester for two and a half years because government haven't done enough to stop that.\"Walter Mikac, whose wife and two young daughters were among the 35 people shot dead in Tasmania by a lone gunman in 1996 in what is Australia's deadliest mass shooting, welcomed the reforms.The changes will \"close critical gaps in our gun laws\" and put community safety first, he said. The government also aims to crackdown on hate speech and symbols, as well as enabling police to ban protests for up to three months after a terrorist attack.Palestine Action Group spokesperson Josh Lees said the new laws were \"incredibly draconian\".\"Australia is seen as a safe country,\" he said, \"where freedom of speech is very important\" but the Bondi shooting was \"perhaps changing the dynamics of that democracy and that freedom\".David Ossip, president of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies, said moves to ban \"intifada\" chants was a \"watershed moment\" in confronting hate and incitement. He also welcomed greater police powers during protests.\"The right to protest is a core Australian value and a fundamental tenet of a democratic society,\" he said.\"But it has never included the right to hide your face and shout slogans calling for violence against one's fellow Australians or waving the flags of groups devoted to murder and destruction.\"Additional reporting by Katy Watson",

    "body": "4 hours agoClaire Keenan,Elettra NeysmithandAbayomi Adisa,BBC Africa, LagosNigerian authorities say they have secured the release of the remaining 130 schoolchildren and teachers kidnapped from a Catholic boarding school in the country's central Niger state.Nigeria's federal government described the latest release as a \"moment of triumph and relief\", after one of the country's worst mass kidnappings.More than 250 children and staff were abducted from St Mary's Catholic school in Papiri on 21 November. Earlier this month about 100 of the children were released.The authorities confirmed \"the rescue of the remaining 130 children and staff\" in a statement, saying \"not a single pupil is left in captivity\".Niger state police chief Adamu Abdullahi Elleman told the BBC that they were being \"examined by security forces and will be taken to their school tomorrow [Monday] to reunite with their families\".Bishop Bulus Dauwa Yohanna, who is in charge of the school as the Catholic cleric who heads the region, also confirmed the development.He said the local governor had informed him of the release of the remaining schoolchildren and teachers, and \"asked me to come and receive them\".Parents are in high spirits over the news of the release, Abdullahi Rofia, a local emergency worker in Papiri where the school is located, told the BBC. The parents are expected to gather at the school later in the day.On Sunday, presidential spokesperson Bayo Onanuga said the total of freed students was now 230.Since the kidnapping, the exact number of people taken and how many have remained in captivity has been unclear.On 8 December, authorities secured the release of 99 children and one teacher, reportedly leaving at least 165 others with the kidnappers.However, the Niger state police chief told the BBC that the 130 who have now been released account for all the remaining abductees, faulting the initial figures released by the school management.It has not been formally made public how the government secured the latest release - or whether any ransom was paid.The announcement by Onanuga included pictures of children smiling and waving. The students are expected to arrive in the Niger state capital, Minna, on Monday.When the earlier release happened the governor of neighbouring Nasarawa state, Abdullahi Sule, told local media that the federal government had played a key role, adding that the behind-the-scenes efforts could not be disclosed for security reasons.The Christian Association of Nigeria reported that 50 students managed to escape at the time of the kidnapping.November's abduction was the latest incident in a number of targeted attacks on schools and places of worship in north and central Nigeria.The attack on St Mary's was preceded by mass kidnappings just days earlier.On 18 November, two people were killed and 38 abducted in an attack on the Christ Apostolic Church in Kwara state, and a day before that, two were killed and 25 Muslim students abducted from Government Girls' Secondary School in Kebbi state.All those taken in the Kwara and Kebbi attacks have since been freed.It is not clear who is behind these kidnappings - most analysts believe they are carried out by criminal gangs seeking ransom payments.On 9 December Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu said his government would continue to work with Niger and other states \"to secure our schools and make the learning environment safer and more conducive for our younger ones\".",

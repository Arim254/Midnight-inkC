It then headed back east, having dropped to an altitude of 10,000 feet, accoring to FlightRadar24.At this time, the plane started broadcasting a \"7700 squawk code\" on its transponder. These are relayed to signify a general emergency onboard, ranging from engine failure to depressurisation to a medical emergency.In February a government plane carrying Secretary of State Marco Rubio had to turn back due to a crack in the window of the cockpit, as well.Defence ministers had gathered in Belgium on Wednesday to discuss security in Ukraine.

    "body": "1 hour agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondentSyria's interim President, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has held his first talks with President Vladimir Putin in Moscow since ousting Russia's ally Bashar al-Assad 10 months ago.Putin spoke of the \"special relationship\" between both countries.Sharaa suggested he would continue to allow Russia access to its military bases in Syria.He was also expected to ask for the extradition of Assad, who was granted asylum after fleeing to Moscow.For years they were enemies, on opposing sides of a bloody civil war.Putin used brutal military force to prop up Bashar al-Assad. And Sharaa's armed Islamist group led the rebel offensive that eventually forced Assad from power.But on Wednesday, the Russian and Syrian leaders sat down together for the first time, putting pragmatism ahead of past enmity.\"Over the past decades, our countries have built a special relationship,\" Putin said.He added that there were \"quite a few interesting and useful undertakings\" on the agenda of their talks, and that Russia stood ready to \"do everything to fulfil them\".Sharaa said he wanted Syria to re-establish its relations with all countries, but \"chiefly with Russia\".\"We are trying to restore and redefine in a new way the nature of these relations so there is independence for Syria, sovereign Syria, and also its territorial unity and integrity and its security stability.\"They were warm words from two men seeking a good working relationship.Russia wants continued access to its Tartous naval port and Hmeimim military airbase on Syria's Mediterranean coast.Sharaa suggested he would allow this, saying Syria would \"respect all agreements concluded throughout the great history\" of their bilateral relations.In turn, he wants help to consolidate his power in Syria, secure its borders and rescue a parlous economy with access to Russian energy and investment.Russian ministers said they were ready to deliver foodstuffs and medication to Syria, and to help repair damaged power and transport infrastructure.But amid the smiles, tensions remain.Syrian sources said Sharaa would ask for Assad to be extradited so the exiled leader could face trial for war crimes. It is thought unlikely Russia would agree.On Monday, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that Russia had granted asylum to Assad because he and his family had \"faced the risk of physical elimination\".",

    "body": "Two French nationals have been handed lengthy prison sentences by a court in Iran after being convicted of espionage, Iranian state media reports.The reports do not name the defendants but they are believed to be Cecile Kohler, 40, and her partner Jacques Paris, 72, the only French nationals being held in Iran. They were arrested in May 2022 during a tourist trip. The pair have been found guilty of spying on behalf of both France and Israel, the reports say.The announcement comes more than a month after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said a deal to exchange French detainees for an Iranian woman held in France was nearly complete.Iran has previously said Kohler and Paris could be released as part of that agreement.Another French tourist, Olivier Grondeau, 34, was released by Iran earlier this year after being handed a five-year prison sentence for \"conspiracy against the Islamic republic\".Iran's judicial news agency Mizan said one of the defendants was sentenced to six years in prison for spying for France, five years for conspiracy against national security and 20 years in exile for \"intelligence co-operation\" with Israel.The other was sentenced to 10 years in prison for spying for France, five years for conspiring against national security and 20 years in exile for being complicit in intelligence co-operation with Israel.Under Iranian law, jail sentences run concurrently. It is unclear what \"exile\" entails, though in other instances convicts have been sent to remote areas.Mizan reports that their pre-trial detention would be deducted from their sentences and that the verdict could be contested within 20 days.France has accused Iran of holding Kohler and Paris arbitrarily and keeping them in conditions akin to torture. Iran denies the claims.Human rights groups say tourists and dual nationals are often held for leverage in diplomatic negotiations, released only when Iran gets something in return.The release of British-Iranian nationals Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori in 2022, after years in detention, came after months of negotiation that saw the UK settle a debt of nearly £400m dating from the 1970s.Kohler and Paris were touted as exchangeable for Mahdieh Esfandiari, who has been held in France since February on charges of promoting terrorism on social media. Iran has repeatedly called her detention arbitrary.Iran is thought to currently hold around 20 Europeans in detention, according to news agency AFP.These include British couple Craig and Lindsay Foreman, who were detained in January while travelling through Iran on a motorcycling world tour and later charged with espionage.Their family maintains they are innocent and are being held in \"horrific conditions\".Last week, 18-year-old French-German cyclist Lennart Monterlos was released after an Iranian court acquitted him of espionage charges.",

    "body": "23 hours agoIone WellsSouth America Correspondent andNadine YousifThe US has struck another vessel off the coast of Venezuela on Tuesday, killing six people, President Donald Trump has said. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the vessel belonged to \"narcoterrorists\" and that it was \"trafficking narcotics\". This is the fifth strike of its kind by the Trump administration on a boat accused of trafficking drugs on international waters since September. In total, 27 people have been reported killed, but the US has not provided evidence or details about identities of the vessels or those on board them.Some lawyers have accused the US of breaching international law, and neighbouring nations like Colombia and Venezuela have condemned the strikes.In his Truth Social post, Trump said \"intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known\" route for smuggling. He also posted an aerial surveillance video showing a small boat on water that is struck by a missile and explodes.US strike on 'Venezuela drug boat': What do we know, and was it legal?What is Trump's goal as US bombs 'Venezuela drugs boat'?Trump did not specify the nationality of those on board, or what drug smuggling organisation they are suspected of belonging to. He added that no US military personnel were injured. The strike comes after a recent leaked memo sent to Congress, and reported on by US media, that said the administration determined the US was in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels. It has also deployed multiple warships to the Caribbean. The US has positioned its strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels as self-defence. Many lawyers questioning the legality of such military action.Framing this as an active armed conflict is likely a way for Trump to justify using more extreme wartime powers – for example killing \"enemy fighters\" even if they have not posed a violent threat, or detaining people indefinitely.While it is true that some drug trafficking occurs in Venezuela, and some cartels operate in the region that some of these vessels allegedly have originated from, it is not considered a hotspot for drug trafficking compared to some other locations in the region.As a result, many believe this is part of a wider political campaign to put military pressure on Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro.The strikes come after the US announced a $50m (£37m) reward for any information leading to the arrest of Maduro - whose election to lead the country has been widely rejected by the international community - on drug-trafficking charges.Venezuela's government has reacted to previous recent strikes with anger. Maduro denies American accusations that he is involved with drugs trafficking, while another official has questioned the veracity of footage posted by Trump.",

    "body": "13 hours agoSayeda AkterBBC Bangla, Dhaka andKelly NgSingaporeAt least 16 people have died after a huge fire broke out at a garment factory in Bangladesh, with officials warning that the toll could rise.Sixteen bodies have been recovered and would be handed to families after DNA testing, as they have been burnt beyond recognition, the fire service said.Distraught relatives gathered outside the four-storey factory in Dhaka's Mirpur area on Tuesday in search of their loved ones still missing.The blaze, which broke out at the factory around midday, was extinguished after three hours. But an adjacent chemical warehouse continued to burn, authorities said.Large fires are relatively common in densely populated Bangladesh, often due to lax safety standards and poor infrastructure. Hundreds of people have been killed in fires in recent years.Up until 21:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on Tuesday, the fire at the chemical warehouse in Mirpur had not been completely doused, media reports said.Fire service officials have not ascertained which of the two buildings caught fire first. According to eyewitnesses, the chemical warehouse stored bleaching powder, plastic and hydrogen peroxide, all of which can intensify fires. Plastic also releases toxic fumes when burned.Most of the deaths were caused by toxic gas and the building's roof door being locked, the fire service said.Fire service director Mohammad Tajul Islam Chowdhury told local media the victims probably died \"instantly\" after inhaling \"highly toxic gas\". Police and military officers are still trying to locate the owners of the factory and the warehouse, Mr Chowdhury told reporters.An investigation into whether the warehouse was operating legally was also ongoing, he added.The fire service said that the chemical warehouse had no fire safety clearance or licence from their department. Meanwhile, officials in northern Dhaka had confirmed that the warehouse had no occupancy certificate or licence to operate, local media reported.Tearful family members stood outside the charred buildings, many of them clutching photographs of their missing relatives. Among them is a man searching desperately for his daughter, Farzana Akhter. \"When I heard about the fire, I came running. But I still haven't found her... I just want my daughter back,\" he told Reuters news agency.Bangladesh has a long history of deadly industrial disasters. In 2021, a fire at a food and drink factory left at least 52 people dead and another 20 injured. The factory was built illegally and had no emergency exit, an investigation later found.In 2019, a fast-moving fire swept through a historic district in Dhaka, killing at least 78 people, including members of a bridal party.The country's deadliest industrial accident to date took place in 2013, when the eight-storey Rana Plaza building housing garment factories near Dhaka collapsed owing to a structural failure, killing more than 1,100 people.",

    "body": "14 hours agoKoh EweChina CustomsCustoms officers recently seized a batch of maps bound for export, which they described as \"problematic\"Chinese customs officers in eastern Shandong province have seized 60,000 maps that \"mislabelled\" the self-governed island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory. The maps, authorities said, also \"omitted important islands\" in the South China Sea, where Beijing's claims overlap with those of its neighbours, including the Philippines and Vietnam.The \"problematic\" maps, meant for export, cannot be sold because they \"endanger national unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity\" of China, authorities said.Maps are a sensitive topic for China and its rivals for reefs, islands and outcrops in the South China Sea.China Customs said that the maps also did not contain the nine-dash line, which demarcates Beijing's claim over nearly the entire South China Sea.The line comprises nine dashes which extends hundreds of miles south and east from its most southerly province of Hainan.The seized maps also did not mark the maritime boundary between China and Japan, authorities said.Authorities said the maps mislabelled \"Taiwan province\", without specifying what exactly the mislabelling was.China sees self-ruled Taiwan its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to take the island. But Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically-elected leaders.Tensions in the South China Sea flare up occassionally - most recently over the weekend, when ships from China and the Philippines figured in another encounter.Manila accused a Chinese ship of deliberately ramming and firing its water cannon at a Philippine government vessel.But Beijing said the incident happened after the Philippine vessel ignored repeated warnings and \"dangerously approached\" the Chinese ship.The Philippines and Vietnam are also particularly sensitive to depictions of the South China Sea in maps.The Barbie movie from 2023 was banned in Vietnam and censored in the Philippines for showing a South China Sea map with the nine dash line.The statement from China Customs did not say where the seized maps were intended to be sold. China supplies much of the world's goods, from Christmas lights to stationery.The confiscation of \"problematic maps\" by Chinese customs officers is not uncommon - though the number of the maps seized in Shandong easily eclipses past seizures. Goods that fail inspection at the customs are destroyed.In March, customs officers at an airport in Qingdao seized a batch of 143 nautical charts that contained \"obvious errors\" in the national borders.In August, customs officers in Hebei province seized two \"problematic maps\" that, among other things, contained a \"misdrawing\" of the Tibetan border.",

    "body": "1 day agoAna FaguyWatch: Surveillance video shows suspect setting Pennsylvania governor's mansion on fireThe man accused of setting Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro’s residence on fire in April was sentenced to 25 to 50 years in state prison as part of a plea deal. Cody Balmer, 38, pleaded guilty to attempted murder, aggravated arson, 22 counts of arson, burglary and other offenses at a court hearing on Tuesday. While the official residence in the state capital of Harrisburg was severely damaged during the fire, people home at the time - including Shapiro, his wife, his four children, and guests and staff members - were able to escape unscathed.Shapiro said his family was supportive of the plea agreement announced by prosecutors.The attack against the governor and his family is part of a wave of political violence in the US, including attempted kidnapping of Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, two assassination attempts against President Donald Trump, the killings of two Minnesota state officials and the killing of commentator Charlie Kirk. At a press conference on Tuesday, the Pennsylvania governor - standing alongside his wife - said his family has had to lean on their faith as they navigated a difficult recovery since the attack.“We will forever be changed by this, we know that time will heal, but the scars will remain,” Shapiro said.Balmer was accused of breaking into the govenor's residence and setting it on fire on the second day of Passover. The governor, who is Jewish, had hosted a Passover celebration the night before. Getty ImagesThe gutted interior of the governor's residenceBalmer had admitted to officials that he removed petrol from a lawn mower and poured it into beer bottles to make Molotov cocktails he used in the attack, Pennsylvania State Police said.He turned himself in 13 hours after the break-in and admitted to “harbouring hatred toward Governor Shapiro”, officials said. Balmer was asked in a police interview what he would have done if he had come face to face with Shapiro. He told police he would have beaten the governor with a hammer, according to an affidavit. Shapiro has served as Pennsylvania's governor since 2023, after working as the state's attorney general.The Democrat was among the top picks to be Kamala Harris's running mate during the 2024 presidential election, but was ultimately passed over. He has frequently been mentioned as a possible future presidential candidate.Getty Images",

    "body": "21 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondentPresident Donald Trump has acknowledged that a $20bn (£15bn) US lifeline to help calm Argentina's currency crisis is an attempt to sway legislative elections this month in the South American nation.Welcoming Argentina's libertarian leader Javier Milei to the White House, Trump warned that the US would not \"waste our time\" with helping Argentina if Milei's party did not prevail.Milei praised Trump for his peacemaking efforts and said the US president's policies would lead to \"prosperity\".Argentina's financial turmoil comes ahead of national midterm elections on 26 October, seen as a test of voters' desire to continue backing Milei's cost-cutting, free-market reform agenda.As Trump sat across the table from his Argentine counterpart on Tuesday, he said the not-so-quiet bit out loud.\"The election is coming up very soon,\" he said. \"It's a very big election.\"Trump added: \"Victory [for Milei] is very important. Your poll numbers I hear are pretty good. I think they will be better after this.\"And, you know, our approvals are somewhat subject to who wins the election.\"A presidential election is not due in Argentina until 2027. But Trump said if \"a socialist wins\" then the US would feel \"a lot differently\" about supporting the South American nation.\"If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina,\" Trump said.For his part, Milei blamed Argentina's economic woes on his political adversaries.\"This liquidity problem that Argentina has is a result of the political attacks we have suffered from our opponents,\" he told Trump.How Milei's 'Thatcherite' economics divided his nation - but won over TrumpTrump is bailing out Argentina. What happened to 'America first'?Trump's backing for his libertarian ally, who took office in December 2023, is no secret.He said the bailout was \"just helping a great philosophy take over a great country\", and the White House has framed it as supporting an important regional ally.But Trump's explicit linking of a recently announced $20bn currency swap between the US and Argentina to Milei's electoral prospects is notable for an American president who has previously railed against foreign interference in elections.In recent provincial elections in Buenos Aires, Milei's La Libertad Avanza coalition (Freedom Advances) performed worse than expected, spooking markets as they watch for any sign his economic programme's days might be numbered.His party has recently been rocked by several corruption scandals.If Milei's party loses seats, or fails to gain more, in this month's midterms – that could affect his government's ability to pass further reforms.Several key vetoes he has tried to make have already been overturned by Congress, where he doesn't have a majority.But will US support actually make a difference?Argentine stocks fell after Tuesday's news conference.This intervention, which was supposed to stabilise the economy in Argentina, now seemed to hinge on Milei securing more political support.And it seems the financial markets are unconvinced that Trump's endorsement will be enough to boost Milei's electoral chances.This currency swap was, economically speaking, supposed to be a bit of a lifeline for Argentina's currency – the peso, which has been losing value for years.As a means to control inflation, Milei had been stopping the peso from devaluing too drastically by keeping it propped up with the country's reserves.The problem with that is that it drained reserves ahead of $20bn of debt due next year.That led to fears, including among investors, that the country was heading for a financial crisis if it defaulted on its debts again.Some thought that to avert this Milei might have to let the currency devalue drastically – which would lead to a spike in prices as people's money would suddenly be worth less.Many economists told me they thought this would be \"political suicide\". So, perhaps the US intervention helps avoid that political disaster.But is this really going to cut through to ordinary voters? Opinion polls suggest that some Argentines are tiring of Milei's sharp austerity measures.His supporters hail them for bringing down inflation and cutting the deficit.But they've come at a social cost – with large cuts to pensions, education, health, infrastructure, and transport and utilities subsidies among other things.",

    "body": "'He transformed R&B forever' - Stars pay tribute to D’Angelo, after his death at 5112 hours agoAna Faguy andMark SavageMusic correspondentFrans Schellekens/RedfernsFellow musicians Beyoncé, Nile Rogers and Lauryn Hill were among those paying their respects to D'AngeloTributes have flooded in for the R&B and soul singer D’Angelo, who has died aged 51 after a pancreatic cancer diagnosis.In a statement, his family wrote that the star, whose real name was Michael Eugene Archer, left behind a \"legacy of extraordinarily moving music\" and asked fans to celebrate “the gift of song that he has left for the world”.The influential singer was known for pioneering neo-soul, a genre blending R&B with other types of music, including hip-hop and jazz. His three albums won four Grammy Awards. The music video for his hit song Untitled (How Does It Feel) became notorious for its smouldering, single-shot performance, where D’Angelo appeared to be performing naked.\"The shining star of our family has dimmed his light for us in this life,\" his family said in a statement obtained by CBS News, the BBC’s US media partner.Fellow musicians Beyoncé, Nile Rogers and Lauryn Hill were among those paying their respects.'Strength and sensitivity'Singer Beyoncé thanked D’Angelo for his music on her website. \"You were the pioneer of neo-soul, and that changed and transformed rhythm and blues forever,\" she wrote. \"We will never forget you.\"Writing about his first meeting with D'Angelo, guitarist and producer Rogers recalled having encouraged the late star - who was then on the way up - to put out his material as it was \"perfect\".\"About a year later I heard one of those songs on the radio. It was genius and it was exactly what he had played for me,\" wrote Rogers. \"I know... I still have the original cassette.\"Singer and rapper Hill, who worked with D'Angelo at the start of his career, shared a similarly lengthy and personal reflection, saying his \"beauty and talent were not of this world\".\"You imaged a unity of strength and sensitivity in Black manhood to a generation that only saw itself as having to be one or the other,\" she wrote.Fellow rappers Doja Cat and Missy Elliot also paid their respects, as well as singers Jill Scott and Jennifer Hudson.\"A true voice of soul and inspiration to many brilliant artists of our generation and generations to come,\" Doja Cat wrote on X. \"Rest Peacefully D'Angelo,\" posted Elliot, who was becoming one of hip-hop's biggest around the same time as the soul singer's rise in the late 1990s.Scott posted: \"I never met D'Angelo but I love him, respect him, admire his gift.\"Hudson noted how \"we lost a true original today\". \"D'Angelo, your voice will live on forever. Rest well, King!!!\"Tyler the Creator said his \"musical DNA\" was shaped by D'Angelo - \"We are so lucky to have been alive to enjoy his art,\" he wrote.ReutersThe award-winning singer was known for pioneering neo-soul, a genre blending R&B with other types of music, including hip-hop and jazzD’Angelo began his career as a songwriter, and worked alongside big names in music like Lauryn Hill and The Roots. He rose to fame in the 1990s with his debut album Brown Sugar. His song, Lady, from that album reached the number 10 spot on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart in 1996. That song earned him multiple Grammy nominations and secured his spot on the music scene.The son of a Pentecostal minister, D'Angelo was born in Richmond, Virginia, and taught himself to play piano when he was just three years old.Throughout his adolescence, he performed locally in groups including Three of a Kind, Michael Archer and Precise, and Intelligent, Deadly but Unique (I.D.U.).When he was 18, he won the amateur talent competition at Harlem's Apollo Theater for three consecutive weeks; and was quickly signed to a publishing deal with EMI.He established himself as a commercial force with his 1995 debut album, also called Brown Sugar, and won two Grammys for the 2000 follow-up, Voodoo.However, he subsequently struggled with alcoholism and nearly died in a car crash in 2005. He returned to music in 2014 with Black Messiah - an album in the works for years - which he finished after watching the national unrest prompted by protests over the failure to convict police officers in the deaths of the unarmed black men Michael Brown and Eric Garner.Getty ImagesD'Angelo's song Lady earned him multiple Grammy nominations and secured his spot in the music sceneIt went on to win the Grammy for best R&B album in February 2016.Among those paying tribute was hip-hop legend DJ Premier, who produced D'Angelo's song Devil's Pie.\"Such a sad loss,\" he wrote on social media. \"We have so many great times. Gonna miss you so much. Sleep Peacefully D' Love You KING.\"The Voodoo album which was released in 2000 topped the US charts and in its most recent list of the greatest albums of all time, Rolling Stone magazine placed it at 28 – one place above The Beatles' White Album.D'Angelo had been working in the studio on what would have been his fourth album with Raphael Saadiq.",

    "body": "1 hour agoLaura Gozzi andPaul KirbyEurope digital editorGlobal Images Ukraine via Getty ImagesRussian missile and drone attacks have knocked out power in regions across UkraineEmergency power outages have been brought in across almost all of Ukraine after a intensive campaign of Russian air strikes on energy infrastructure.This will be the fourth consecutive winter of blackouts throughout Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.The energy ministry said all but two regions were affected. Only the eastern Donetsk region at the forefront of the war is exempt, while the northern Chernihiv region is already facing hourly outages.As well as targeting the power network, Russia has increasingly targeted Ukraine's railways. Ukraine has meanwhile ramped up attacks on Russian oil refineries, in border regions and beyond.One oil depot in the Crimean peninsula - which Moscow illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014 - has been burning for three days following a second Ukrainian drone attack in a week.The Marine Oil Terminal in Feodosia is the largest in Crimea and an important logistical link for Russian troops operating in Ukraine.Telegram channel Supernova+Images of the fire at Feodosia were posted on Ukrainian Telegram channelsKyiv's armed forces general staff said on Wednesday that 16 fuel tanks were damaged and that a large-scale blaze was continuing to burn.The surge in drone attacks on oil refineries and pipelines has also led to fuel shortages and price rises in some parts of Russia - a development that Ukrainian leaders hope will hit Russia's war effort and help bring the Kremlin to the negotiating table.The strikes have reduced Russian fuel exports to their lowest level since the start of the war, according to figures from the International Energy Agency.Ukraine's energy ministry said emergency restrictions were being brought in \"because of the complicated situation\". Emergency work was taking place in all regions affected by Russian attack, grid operator Ukrenergo said, and it urged consumers who still had power to use it sparingly.Temperatures in parts of Ukraine were forecast to fall to 3C overnight into Thursday.The electricity company in Lviv in western Ukraine said that because the outages were under emergency conditions there was no possibility to warn consumers in advance.ReutersPower outages have increased in recent weeks because of Russia's campaign of air strikesRussia argues its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure are aimed at its military, but millions of civilians have already been affected by outages in recent weeks. On one night alone last week, on 9-10 October, a combined missile and drone attack caused power cuts in nine regions, from Kharkiv and Sumy in the north to Odesa in the south.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Moscow of aiming to \"create chaos and apply psychological pressure on the population through strikes on energy facilities and railways\".Kyiv has long been pushing to be given more weapons that could allow it to strike deeper into Russia, and Zelensky this week vowed that long-range weapons would be used only on military targets, not civilians.Ukraine's Western allies have been wary of providing long-range weaons through concern such a move would escalate the war.Moscow has repeatedly said it would view the use of Western-made weapons to hit Russia as \"direct participation\" of Nato countries in the war in Ukraine.However, Moscow's \"red line\" on Western missiles has already been crossed without any clear consequences.US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly spoken of his impatience with Russia's failure to move towards ending the war, has said he is considering supplying Kyiv with Tomahawk missiles.He is due to meet Zelensky in the US on Friday.At a Nato summit on Wednesday, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the US and its allies would \"impose costs on Russia for its continued aggression\" if the war in Ukraine did not come to an end.The US stood ready to do its part \"in ways that only the United States can do,\" Hegseth said, without elaborating further. He also encouraged Nato countries to contribute to the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (Purl) programme under which allies buy US-made weapons that are then sent on to Ukraine.Several countries have already said they would take part in Purl. Germany on Wednesday said it would spend $500m (£374m) on weaponry for Ukraine, while the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries have collectively pledged $1bn.Kyiv remains dependent on Western arms donations to push back Russian troops, although it has been developing its own defence industry.Research published by the Kiel Institute in Germany this week showed that military aid sent to Ukraine had declined by 43% compared with the first half of the year.",

    "body": "9 hours agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology Correspondent andLiv McMahonBBC Technology JournalistReutersOpenAI plans to allow a wider range of content, including erotica, on its popular chatbot ChatGPT as part of its push to \"treat adult users like adults\",  says its boss Sam Altman.In a post on X on Tuesday, Mr Altman said upcoming versions of the popular chatbot would enable it to behave in a more human-like way  - \"but only if you want it, not because we are usage maxxing\".The move, reminiscent of Elon Musk's xAI's recent introduction of two sexually explicit chatbots to Grok, could help OpenAI attract more paying subscribers.It is also likely to intensify pressure on lawmakers to introduce tighter restrictions on chatbot companions.OpenAI did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment.Mr Altman said OpenAI had previously made ChatGPT \"pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues\".These changes were announced in a blog post in August, which no longer appears on OpenAI's website.\"We realise this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right,\" Mr Altman posted on Tuesday.He said ChatGPT could soon relax the restrictions \"now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools\".He added: \"In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our 'treat adult users like adults' principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults.\" The changes come after OpenAI was sued earlier this year by parents of a US teen who took his own life.The lawsuit filed by Matt and Maria Raine, who are the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine, was the first legal action accusing OpenAI of wrongful death.The family included chat logs between Adam, who died in April, and ChatGPT that show him explaining he has suicidal thoughts.In a statement given at the time, OpenAI told the BBC it was reviewing the filing.\"We extend our deepest sympathies to the Raine family during this difficult time,\" the company said.Child safety concernsWritten erotica does not require age verification in the UK under the Online Safety Act. However, pornographic images, including those generated by AI, would require users to prove they are over 18.In the US, critics say OpenAI's decision to allow erotica on the platform shows the need for more regulation at the federal and state levels.\"How are they going to make sure that children are not able to access the portions of ChatGPT that are adult-only and provide erotica?\" said Jenny Kim, a partner at the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner. Ms Kim is involved in a lawsuit against Meta that claims the company's Instagram's algorithm harms the mental health of teen users.\"OpenAI, like most of big tech in this space, is just using people like guinea pigs,\" she said. In April, TechCrunch reported that OpenAI was allowing accounts in which a user had registered as a minor to generate graphic erotica.OpenAI said at the time that the company was rolling out a fix to limit such content.A survey published this month by the nonprofit Centre for Democracy and Technology (CDT) found that one in five students report that they or someone they know has had a romantic relationship with AI.On Monday, California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill passed by the state legislature that would have blocked developers from offering AI chatbots companions to children unless the companies could guarantee the software wouldn't breed harmful behaviour.Newsom said it was \"imperative that adolescents learn how to safely interact with AI systems\" in a message that accompanied his veto.At the nationwide level, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has launched an inquiry into how AI chatbots interact with children.In the US Senate last month, bipartisan legislation was introduced that would chatbot users to file liability claims against their developers.Why introduce erotica?Mr Altman's announcement on Tuesday comes as sceptics have been questioning the rapid rise in the value of AI tech companies.OpenAI's revenue is growing, but it has never been profitable.Tulane University business professor Rob Lalka, author of The Venture Alchemists, said the major AI companies find themselves in a battle for market share.\"No company has ever had the kind of adoption that OpenAI saw with ChatGPT,\" Prof Lalka told BBC News. \"They needed to continue to push along that exponential growth curve, achieving market domination as much as they can,\" he added.",

    "body": "Foul skies, fading light: How air pollution is stealing India's sunshine2 days agoSoutik BiswasIndia correspondentHindustan Times via Getty ImagesIndia faces a severe air pollution crisis, ranking among the world's top 10 most polluted countriesIndia is losing sunlight.A new study by six Indian scientists finds that over the past three decades, sunshine hours - the time direct sunlight reaches the Earth's surface - have steadily declined across most of India, driven by clouds, aerosols and local weather.Data from 20 weather stations from 1988 to 2018 shows a persistent decline in sunshine hours nationwide, with only the northeast region seeing a mild seasonal reprieve, according to the paper published in Scientific Reports, a peer-reviewed journal published by Nature Portfolio.Scientists from Banaras Hindu University, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and the India Meteorological Department report that the steepest annual declines occurred in the northern inland region - notably Amritsar and Kolkata - as well as along the Himalayan belt and the west coast, particularly Mumbai.All of nine India's geograpically diverse regions showed an overall annual decline in sunshine hours, though the rate of decrease varied across India. Monthly analysis revealed significant increases from October to May, followed by sharp drops from June to July in six of the nine regions.This seasonal pattern of sunshine intersects with a deeper, long-standing problem: India's severe air pollution crisis - it's now among the world's top 10 polluted countries - which scientists trace back to the 1990s. Rapid urbanisation, industrial growth and land-use changes drove up fossil fuel use, vehicle emissions and biomass burning, sending aerosols into the atmosphere and dimming the Sun's rays.  Getty ImagesMumbai's sunshine hours are gradually declining, the scientists foundIn winter, high air pollution from smog, temperature inversions and crop burning across the Indo-Gangetic plains produces light-scattering aerosols, which reduce sunshine hours.These aerosols - tiny solid or liquid particles from dust, vehicle exhaust, crop burning, and other sources - persist in the air long enough to affect sunlight, climate and health.During June-July, monsoon clouds blanket much of India, sharply reducing sunlight even though aerosol levels are lower than in winter.Scientists note that higher sunshine hours from October to May don't indicate cleaner air; rather, they reflect more cloud-free days. Hazy winter sunlight may scatter or diffuse, lowering intensity without entirely blocking sunshine, which instruments still record as sunshine hours.\"Our study found that shrinking sunshine hours are linked to clouds that linger longer without releasing rain, blocking more sunlight. These longer-lasting clouds form indirectly due to aerosols that alter weather and climate,\" says Manoj Kumar Srivastava, a professor of geophysics at the Banaras Hindu University, and one of the authors of the study.Aerosols have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching the ground in India by about 13%, while clouds accounted for an additional 31-44% drop in surface solar radiation between 1993 and 2022, according to Sachchida Nand Tripathi, an atmospheric scientist at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur.These patterns raise concerns for agriculture, daily life and India's solar energy ambitions, while highlighting where solar panels could be most effective.Solar now makes up 47% of India's renewable energy capacity. The government says it's on track for 500GW of renewables by 2030, with more than 100GW of solar installed as of early 2025. But declining sunlight could cast a shadow on the country's solar ambitions.According to Prof Tripathi, air pollution compounds the problem. It reduces solar panel output by 12-41% depending on the type of photovoltaic system - the technology that converts sunlight into electricity - and costs an estimated $245-835m in lost power generation.LightRocket via Getty ImagesIndia's solar ambitions could be dimmed by declining sunlightStudies also show that cleaner air could boost India's annual solar energy production by 6-28 terawatt hours of electricity - enough to power millions of homes for a year.But the impact of pollution doesn't stop at solar energy. It also takes a heavy toll on agriculture, causing an estimated 36–50% loss in crop yields - mainly rice and wheat - in the country's most polluted regions, according to Prof Tripathi.India isn't alone in losing sunshine; across the world, rising air pollution and shifting weather patterns have dimmed the skies.A study published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics observed that Europe likely experienced reduced sunlight reaching the ground because of air pollution between1970–2009. In Germany, sunshine hours decreased by approximately 11% from 1951 to 1980, attributed to industrial gas emissions and associated cloud formation.Research also showed that stricter clean-air laws in the 1990s led to a rebound in sunshine hours across Europe.China also experienced a significant decline in sunshine hours from the 1960s to the 2000s, primarily due to increased aerosol emissions from rapid industrialisation. Sunshine duration varied across Chinese cities, with some areas experiencing more significant declines due to factors such as air pollution.The good news: scientists say the Earth's surface has gradually been receiving more sunlight since the 1980s - a trend known as global brightening, following decades of dimming.New analysis of satellite data from 1984 to 2018 appears to confirm this, showing the effect is strongest over land and in the Northern Hemisphere, driven mainly by falling aerosols in the 1980s and 1990s and shifts in cloud patterns.The bad news: heavily polluted countries like India are missing out. If the Sun keeps hiding behind smog, India risks running on fumes instead of full power.",

    "body": "2 hours agoRushdi AbualoufGaza correspondent andSeher AsafThe UN humanitarian chief has urged Israel to open more crossings into Gaza to allow a surge of aid, after Israel warned it would limit supplies into the territory over delays from Hamas in releasing the bodies of deceased hostages.Tom Fletcher called on both Israel and Hamas to implement the terms of the ceasefire agreement, saying it was \"essential that we do not squander the immense progress made\" through the US-brokered deal.There has been growing anger in Israel over the delayed return of hostages' bodies, and the key Rafah crossing between Egypt and southern Gaza remained closed on Wednesday.In Gaza, people have been stockpiling food as prices surge over fears the ceasefire may not hold.Humanitarian aid has been entering Gaza since the ceasefire deal took effect on 10 October, but Israel threatened to restrict supplies after Hamas did not return the bodies of all 28 deceased hostages by Monday, as agreed. Hamas says it has had difficulty locating the remains.So far, seven hostages' bodies have been returned to Israel from Gaza. Hamas said it would return two more bodies later on Wednesday.In a post on X, Fletcher said Hamas must \"make strenuous efforts to return all the bodies of the deceased hostages\". He added: \"As Israel has agreed, they must allow the massive surge of humanitarian aid - thousands of trucks a week - on which so many lives depend, and on which the world has insisted.\"He called for \"more crossings open and a genuine, practical, problem-solving approach to removing remaining obstacles\" and said \"withholding aid from civilians is not a bargaining chip\".The Rafah crossing has largely remained closed since fighting broke out after the 7 October 2023 attacks.US President Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan stipulated that opening the crossing would be \"subject to the same mechanism implemented\" during a temporary ceasefire earlier this year. Then, it reopened briefly to allow wounded Palestinians to be evacuated for medical treatment.Meanwhile, an official from Cogat, the Israeli military body in charge of aid for Gaza, said on Tuesday: \"Humanitarian aid will not pass through the Rafah crossing. No such agreement has been reached at any stage.\"The UN chief also said he was \"gravely concerned by the evidence of violence against civilians in Gaza\".Reports of masked Hamas gunmen executing eight Palestinians in public have triggered fear and outrage among residents of Gaza.Adm Brad Cooper, head of US Central Command, called on Hamas to \"suspend violence and shooting at innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza\" in a post on X. He urged the group to seize \"an historic opportunity for peace\" by \"fully standing down, strictly adhering to President Trump's 20-point peace plan and disarming without delay\". Hamas has said it is targeting \"criminals and collaborators with Israel\". Food prices have surged in Gaza as Palestinians stockpile food, concerned that the ceasefire deal will not hold.Traders and suppliers in the enclave have been hoarding food items to create shortages and drive up profits, fearing that the war could resume, local residents told the BBC.\"Every time we start to feel safe, new threats appear, and we fear the war will start all over again,\" says mother-of-six Neven Al-Mughrabi, a displaced resident from Gaza who lives in Khan Younis.\"I lost my house in Gaza City, I decided to stay here with my family because I don't trust the ceasefire and we're sick of displacement.\"She added that a trader in Khan Younis's main market said demand for flour, oil and sugar had surged within hours. \"Despite the sudden rise of prices by about 30%, people are buying as if they don't trust the calm will last long, everyone is afraid aid will stop,\" Neven says.Father-of-six Khaled Halas, who lives in Deir al-Balah, said there was \"no water, no electricity and no tents\". Halas was displaced from the Shuja'iyya area of Gaza City and has been forced to move many times.\"The Shuja'iyya [area] is completely closed. I went to the vegetable market where gunfire broke out, we have no protection,\" he said. \"There is constant shooting in our area, and life there is completely destroyed.\" The growing unease comes as mediators meet in Egypt in a bid to bridge differences between Hamas and Israel, and keep the first phase of the ceasefire deal on track. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Wednesday that one of four bodies handed over by Hamas overnight \"does not match any of the hostages\" following examinations at the National Institute of Forensic Medicine.  The other three bodies have been identified as Tamir Nimrodi, 20, Eitan Levy, 53, and Uriel Baruch, 35, the Hostages Families Forum said.The ceasefire agreement appears to acknowledge that Hamas and other Palestinian factions may not have been able to find all hostage remains before the initial deadline on Monday. Under the agreement with Hamas, Israel agreed to hand over the bodies of 15 Palestinians in return for every deceased Israeli hostage.Israel has returned the bodies of a further 45 Palestinians, the Hamas-run health ministry confirmed on Wednesday. This brings the total number of bodies released by Israel to 90.The delay in the return of the bodies of Israeli hostages has led to anger in Israel. The son of Amiram Cooper - one of the deceased Israeli hostages whose body is still being held in Gaza - said that he and other hostage relatives are trying \"to find the strength somehow to pick ourselves up... and continue the fight\".\"It's clear to us that they [Hamas] could have and should have released more and they're playing games,\" Rotem said.

    "body": "An elite military unit has said it has seized power in Madagascar from President Andry Rajoelina following weeks of youth-led protests over water and power cuts across the country. Crowds were seen celebrating in the streets of the country's capital Antananarivo. Standing outside the presidential palace on Tuesday, CAPSAT chief Col Michael Randrianirina said the military would form a government and hold elections within two years. CAPSAT stands for Personnel Administration and Technical and Administrative Services Corps, and is the most powerful military unit in Madagascar. Rajoelina's whereabouts are unknown, but he has said he is sheltering in a \"safe place\" following an alleged attempt on his life by \"military personnel and politicians\". CAPSAT has denied any involvement in any such move.More on this story here",

    "body": "Footage shows a house drifting out to sea after the remnants of Typhoon Halong hit Alaska over the weekend. After crossing the Pacific Ocean, the storm brought hurricane-force winds that left one person dead and another two missing. Authorities have rescued two dozen people from homes that drifted out to sea as around 1,300 were displaced. Brea Paul, who filmed the video on 12 October in Kipnuk, said she had seen about 20 other houses floating away overnight, some of which \"would blink their phone lights at us like they were asking for help but we couldn't even do anything\".",

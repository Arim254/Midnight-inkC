The search warrant was based on a lead investigators had received, but no arrests were made, the Pima County sheriff's department said. A person was also questioned at a traffic stop on Friday night, but was released, the department added. It comes after local officials said investigators had found DNA at Guthrie's address that did not belong to her or anyone close to her.The 84-year-old disappeared in the middle of night from her home in Tucson, Arizona, two weeks ago. Authorities believe she was taken against her will.The sheriff's department confirmed on Saturday that law enforcement officers had executed a federal court-ordered search warrant based on a lead at the residence in connection with the Guthrie case.The department did not provide further details about the lead or the residents of the house, saying only that no one was arrested. More than a dozen law enforcement vehicles, both marked and unmarked, were  seen in the area by BBC News, including Swat teams and forensics.Armed police teams were seen coming in and out of the area, with a sheriff's vehicle blocking the road.Investigators have also found several gloves, with the closest discovered about two miles from Nancy Guthrie's home.The sheriff's department said reports that a glove was found inside her home or on the property were inaccurate. All collected evidence had been sent for laboratory analysis, they added.It said investigators had been able to establish identifying details about the suspect after analysing footage from a doorbell camera outside Guthrie's home.Getty ImagesUS news anchor Savannah Guthrie and her mother NancyThe suspect was wearing a 25-litre Ozark Trail Hiker Pack backpack in the footage, the FBI said.

Investigators have also issued a wider appeal for video footage from Guthrie's neighbours.Police have said Nancy Guthrie, 84, needed daily medication and had limited mobility.Savannah Guthrie and her two siblings have released a number of social media pleas directed at their mother's abductor.They believe she is still alive and have indicated they would be willing to pay for her safe return.Watch: New video shows masked person outside Nancy Guthrie's home",

Details of other possible attacks in nearby villages remained unclear and reports have noted the toll could rise.A security report cited by AFP said bandits came on \"41 motorcycles, each carrying two or three men\".Nigeria's leaders are under pressure to curb violence, with jihadist groups active in the north-west and separatist insurgents based in the country's south-east.The US launched Christmas Day strikes targeting Islamist militants in Nigeria's northern Sokoto state and President Donald Trump warned of further attacks \"if they continue to kill Christians\". Many of the victims of jihadist violence are Muslim, according to organisations monitoring political violence in Nigeria.",

    "body": "11 hours agoAleks PhillipsGetty ImagesThe event was due to take place over five days in late FebruaryAn annual cigar festival in Cuban capital Havana has become the latest casualty of a fuel shortage caused by a US oil blockade.The organising committee of the Festival del Habano announced on Saturday that this year's event - which was due to take place over five days in late February - would be postponed until further notice. It said the decision was motivated \"by the complex economic situation\" facing Cuba due to the \"economic, commercial and financial blockade\" by the US.A fuel shortage causing power cuts on the Caribbean island has been worsened by the US seizing oil shipments from Cuba's long-standing ally Venezuela.Cuba also has a shortage of aviation fuel, leading several airlines to suspend services there, while some countries, including the UK, have warned against non-essential travel to the island.Cuban cigars are regarded as among the finest in the world, but are illegal in the US due to long-standing American trade embargoes. More than 1,300 people from around 70 countries are estimated to attend the Habano Festival each year to sample cigars from Cuba's producers, as well as visit tobacco plantations and factories.With international tourism to the island nation limited by the US embargo, the festival's organisers said they hoped to wait until conditions had improved.The organising committee said it was working on setting a new date, which has yet to be announced.\"The priority of the Habano Festival is to offer its participants a comprehensive experience at the height of the relevance and prestige that this event represents internationally,\" it said.\"The postponement of this celebration is a measure aimed at protecting this experience.\"Venezuela was previously believed to have sent around 35,000 barrels of oil a day to Cuba before the US military seized former president Nicolás Maduro on 3 January.Power cuts lasting up to 18 hours a day have since affected hospital emergency wards, dialysis patients and pumping stations.US President Donald Trump has urged Cuban leaders to \"make a deal\" or face unspecified consequences.UN human rights experts have described Washington's restrictions on Cuba's oil imports as an \"extreme form of unilateral economic coercion\".The US and Cuba have had a strained relationship since the communist Fidel Castro overthrew a US-backed government in 1959. US economic and trade embargoes on Cuba have been in place since 1960.While steps were taken to improve diplomatic relations, particularly under former US President Barack Obama, the Trump administration has reversed many of these moves.",

No-one was injured and an investigation into the blaze has been established, Cuba's energy ministry said in a post on X. The fire occurred close to where two oil tankers had been moored in Havana Bay.A fuel shortage in Cuba has been worsened by the US blocking oil shipments from Venezuela, a long-standing ally in the region, to the island.Venezuela was previously believed to have sent it around 35,000 barrels of oil a day before the US military captured former president Nicolás Maduro in a raid on the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, on 3 January.The US also confiscated Venezuelan oil tankers, cutting off key supplies of fuel to Cuba, and pledged new tariffs on countries that sell oil to Cuba.US President Donald Trump has urged Cuban leaders to \"make a deal\" or face unspecified consequences, after flows of oil and money from Venezuela were cut off.Electricity cuts have impacted hospital emergency wards, dialysis patients and pumping stations amid the latest supply shortfalls.Cuba also has a shortage of aviation fuel, leading several airlines to suspend services to the Caribbean island nation, while some countries, including the UK, have warned against non-essential travel there.\"Authorities have introduced fuel rationing, scaled back public services, and made temporary changes to healthcare, education, transport and tourism operations to conserve severely limited energy supplies,\" the UK Foreign Office warned recently.As the oil embargo continues to make life and access to essentials difficult in Cuba, two Mexican ships carrying 800 tonnes of humanitarian aid arrived in Havana Bay on Thursday.United Nations human rights experts have described Washington's restrictions on Cuba's oil imports as an \"extreme form of unilateral economic coercion\".UN human rights chief Volker Türk said he was \"extremely concerned\" about the worsening crisis in Cuba.The US and Cuba have had a strained relationship since the communist Fidel Castro overthrew a US-backed government in 1959.

    "body": "1 day agoAleks PhillipsGetty ImagesProsecutors in Paris have opened investigations into five baby formula manufacturers after several issued mass recalls over concerns their product contained a toxin.Nestle, Lactalis, Danone, Babybio and La Marque en moins will be probed over whether there was any criminal wrongdoing in distributing baby formula that may have been contaminated with cereulide.French authorities have received complaints from eight individuals who reported their child vomited after consuming baby formula.Last week, Nestle and Danone issued recalls in more than 60 countries, including the UK, over potentially contaminated batches.At least 36 infants in the UK have suffered from suspected food poisoning after consuming baby formula, officials have said.Cereulide is a toxin which is unlikely to be destroyed through cooking or when making baby milk. If consumed, it can cause nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps.The toxin in baby formula was linked to an ingredient called arachidonic acid (ARA) oil, which gives it some of the same growth properties as breast milk.The UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) earlier said a third-party supplier of ARA was the source of the contamination and was no longer being used.That supplier is now widely thought to be a Chinese firm, which Agence France-Presse identified as Wuhan-based Cabio Biotech. The BBC has approached the company for comment.On Thursday, China's national market regulator told domestic baby formula manufacturers to test for cereulide, without mentioning specific companies.Prosecutors in Paris will seek to establish whether the baby formula producers are liable for distributing a tainted product.It will be co-ordinated with local probes into whether there was a causal link between the contaminated formula and the deaths of three babies in France. Nestle and France's health ministry have stressed there was as-yet no evidence to indicate such a link.So far 28 batches of baby formula produced by Nestle, which makes SMA, and Danone, which makes Aptamil and Cow & Gate, have been recalled.Danone and Nestle have given assurances to the FSA that recalled batches were produced some time ago and were unlikely still to be on UK shop shelves. However, they may be in cupboards at home, which is why parents and caregivers are being asked to check their supplies.Nestle said on Friday that it intended to run five factories around the clock to increase baby formula production after the global recall. Those factories are in France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands.\"We are focused on increasing the availability of infant formula to meet demand, providing parents and families with high quality products they can trust,\" the Swiss firm said.",

    "body": "2 days agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorBloomberg via Getty ImagesPeter Magyar is ahead in the polls with less than two months to go before electionsLess than two months before Hungary's election, opposition leader Peter Magyar has accused his rivals of planning to blackmail him with a secretly recorded sex tape, and says he is filing a complaint with authorities.Magyar, who leads long-time Prime Minister Viktor Orban in the polls, said he suspected there were plans to release a tape of him from August 2024, when he says he engaged in consensual sex with a now ex-girlfriend at a party.He was responding to a photo recently posted online of a bedroom in an apartment dating back to then. Leading figures in Orban's Fidesz party said they knew nothing about the claims. The BBC has approached Orban's spokesman for comment.Magyar accused Fidesz of trying to blackmail him and made three allegations of unlawful conduct in a statement on Friday.Although no video has been published, he said one from that date would have been \"recorded with secret service equipment and possibly faked\".Magyar made no mention in his statement of the ex-girlfriend he had been with at the time of the alleged incident, although he said on Thursday he had accused her of extortion 15 months ago - an allegation she denied.She told Hungarian media that they were both victims regarding the alleged illicit video and she was ready to take legal action with him.Magyar accused Fidesz leaders of timing their campaign to coincide with the start of his nationwide campaign next week, and of trying to ruin the last week he was spending with his three sons ahead of the April election.Fidesz communications director Tamas Menczer accused Magyar of lying, while Orban's chief of staff Gergely Gulyas told reporters he could not comment on something he knew nothing about.Orban, Hungary's nationalist leader, has been in office for 16 years, but with parliamentary elections on 12 April, Magyar's centre-right Tisza party is at least eight points ahead in the latest opinion poll by Hungary's Idea Institute.Fidesz has so far focused its campaign on attacking the European Union, accusing Brussels of trying to bring down his government. He is seen as Vladimir Putin's closest ally in Europe and has called on the EU to stop sending money to Ukraine.On Friday, US President Donald Trump praised Orban as a \"truly strong and powerful leader\", ahead of a visit by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Trump said he had been \"proud to ENDORSE Viktor\" for re-election in 2022 and was \"honoured to do so again\".The election campaign is not even due to start until 21 February, but Magyar's allegations of dirty tricks are an indication of how murky the next few weeks may become.Magyar has built support across Hungary over the past two years, promising to reset relations with Hungary's European partners. A one-time Fidesz loyalist, he was once married to former justice minister Judit Varga, whose political career ended during a scandal in 2024. They divorced the year prior.",

    "body": "1 day agoGrace Eliza GoodwinReutersAn Indian man accused of plotting to kill a Sikh separatist leader in New York City has pleaded guilty to three criminal charges in a federal court.Nikhil Gupta, 54, admitted to murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. He faces up to 40 years in prison.The target of the alleged plot, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, is a US citizen who advocates for Khalistan. The Khalistan movement calls for an independent homeland for Sikhs in India.Prosecutors allege Gupta was directed by an Indian government official to carry out the plot. India denies having anything to do with the alleged plot to kill Pannun.\"Nikhil Gupta plotted to assassinate a US citizen in New York City,\" said US attorney Jay Clayton. \"He thought that from outside this country he could kill someone in it without consequence, simply for exercising their American right to free speech. But he was wrong, and he will face justice.\"The BBC has contacted Gupta's lawyer for comment. Pannun said in a statement to the BBC that \"Nikhil Gupta's guilty plea was judicial confirmation that India's Modi government orchestrated a structured murder-for-hire assassination plot on American soil\". India has labelled Pannun a terrorist, though he denies this, stressing he is merely an activist.Sikhs are a religious minority that make up about 2% of India's population. Some groups have long called for a separate homeland for Sikhs.The movement is not prominent in India now with most major political parties, including in Punjab - where Sikhs make up the majority of the population - opposing such calls. But supporters in the Sikh diaspora have continued to advocate for Khalistan.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesSikh activist and dual US-Canadian citizen, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, was the target of a murder plot Prosecutors alleged that Gupta was recruited by an Indian government employee in May 2023, adding that the pair met in Delhi to discuss the potential assassination.The officer, Vikash Yadav, worked for Indian government's Cabinet Secretariat, which houses India's foreign intelligence service, the Research and Analysis Wing, according to the indictment. Yadav has not been arrested in connection to the charges. The indictment alleged that, at Yadav's orders, Gupta contacted a man to hire someone to carry out the killing in New York. The man, a government informant, introduced Gupta to a second person who presented himself as a hitman but who was actually an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration officer, prosecutors said.Prosecutors alleged that Yadav gave Gupta information about the murder target, including his home address in New York and his phone numbers, which Gupta then fed to the purported hitman. Shortly after Nijjar's murder, Gupta allegedly told the purported hitman that Nijjar was \"also the target\", adding \"we have so many targets\", prosecutors said. Canada then accused India of being linked to both Nijjar's murder and to the murder plot against Pannun. India denied any involvement in both cases.  ",

    "body": "1 day agoMadeline HalpertReutersTravel groups and airlines are warning of potential disruption as the US federal government partially shut down after lawmakers failed to reach a deal on funding the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) .Several groups, including Airlines for America, said in a joint statement on Friday that without a deal, the risk of unscheduled absences by Transportation Security Administration workers increased, causing flight delays and longer wait times.\"Travellers and the US economy cannot afford to have essential TSA personnel working without pay,\" they said.A partial government shutdown began at midnight (05:00 GMT) on Saturday after Congress failed to pass a bill to fund DHS operations.In exchange for a funding deal, Democrats had been pushing for more restrictions on US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which will not be significantly affected by the shutdown because of funding from the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" last year. Democrats have been demanding reforms after federal agents killed Alex Pretti and Renee Good, two Minneapolis residents who were protesting the Trump administration's immigration raids in Minnesota, in January.They have asked for a number of changes within the DHS including a ban on immigration agents wearing face masks, better identification for officers and stricter rules for obtaining warrants. On Thursday, Senate Democrats blocked two funding bills because the measures did not include the immigration reforms. The most recent funding measure passed at the end of January only funded the DHS for two weeks while lawmakers from both sides of the aisle attempted to reach a deal on immigration reforms. On Friday, US President Donald Trump said \"we'll see what happens\" when asked by reporters whether he anticipated cutting a deal with Democrats to fund the DHS.\"We always have to protect our law enforcement,\" Trump added.  The shutdown is expected to affect several agencies under the DHS umbrella, including the US Coast Guard and TSA. Last year, the US government saw its longest full shutdown in history, which lasted 43 days and led to many federal workers going without pay as well as flight chaos. Democrats at the time were pushing for more health care funding to address rising health care costs. Congress is set to take a recess until 23 February, meaning the shutdown could continue until Trump's State of the Union address the following day. However, lawmakers could be called back to Washington earlier if they seem on the brink of a deal. The partial shutdown is unlikely to cause as much travel chaos as last year's because the Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees air traffic controllers, has already been funded for the rest of the year. But TSA agents - who fall under the DHS - may have to go without pay if the shutdown drags on, meaning people could see longer lines at airports if workers call in sick. The US Coast Guard, which the DHS also oversees, could also be affected. Vice Admiral Thomas Allan told lawmakers that going a few days without funding would mean about 56,000 workers going without pay, leading the agency to suspend missions that were not critical or lifesaving. DHS has $165bn (£120bn) from Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act - which also included $75bn to fund ICE - that it could use to address some of the funding shortfalls. ",

    "body": "7 hours agoMax MatzaGetty ImagesObama seen on the campaign trail in November 2025Former US President Barack Obama has indirectly addressed a racist video posted on President Donald Trump's social media, telling a podcast host that the \"shame\" and \"decorum\" that once guided public officials is now lost.The offensive video included a clip depicting Obama and his wife Michelle as apes, which drew widespread criticism from Democrats and Republicans. The White House initially defended the video, calling backlash \"fake outrage\". The post was later blamed on a staff member and deleted.Obama spoke to liberal podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen, who asked the first black US president about the tone of political discourse. Cohen cited Trump's post among several recent controversies. The clip - set to the song The Lion Sleeps Tonight - was included at the end of a video Trump's Truth Social account shared containing unfounded claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election. The post led to outrage from politicians, including from senior members of Trump's Republican party.Senator Tim Scott - the only black Republican senator - described it as \"the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House\".The clip recalls racist caricatures comparing black people to monkeys, and appears to have been taken from an X post shared by conservative meme creator Xerias in October.Trump has told reporters that he \"didn't see\" the part of the video that showed the Obamas.\"I didn't make a mistake,\" he told reporters when asked whether he planned to apologise.The 47-minute podcast featuring Obama was released on Saturday. The episode begins with the host asking him to comment on US \"discourse\", which he says \"has devolved to a level of cruelty that we haven't seen before\".Cohen notes claims by the White House that the \"victims\" of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are \"domestic terrorists\", and adds \"just days ago, Donald Trump put a picture of you, your face, on an ape's body\".Obama responds by saying: \"It's important to recognise that the majority of the American people find this behaviour deeply troubling.\"It is true that it gets attention. It's true that it's a distraction.\"But Obama said that while travelling around the US, he found himself meeting people who \"still believe in decency, courtesy, kindness\".\"There's this sort of clown show that's happening in social media and on television,\" he continued. \"And what is true is that there doesn't seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office, right? \"That's been lost.\"He did not mention Trump by name in his response.During the interview, Obama spoke about a range of issues. He praised protesters who have peacefully organised against immigration operations, discussed electoral redistricting and talked about his presidential library, which is due to open in Chicago next year.Watch: Trump says he 'didn't see' racist clip depicting Obamas as apes",

Footage it published showed officers, still in their masks, leading the two suspect away and into a waiting police car. Among the disguises was the red overalls and mask from the Spanish Netflix show Money Heist.Police said the two seen being detained in the footage had 30 criminal records between them, and that the woman pretended to be pregnant to avoid arrest.Police added that the arrests form part of Operation Tracking, a state initiative aimed at tacking the theft and resale of mobile phones, which has led to more than 13,000 devices being located and approximately 4,400 being returned.It is not the first time Latin American officers have used fancy dress while apprehending suspected criminals.Peruvian police often use the tactics, disguising their agents in elaborate costumes on occasions such as Valentine's Day, Halloween and Christmas.Raids have also been carried out dressed as the Grinch, a capybara and various other Marvel superheroes.",

    "body": "1 day agoMadeline HalpertWatch: \"I will not back down\", says Don Lemon after pleading not guiltyFormer CNN host Don Lemon has pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from his coverage of a protest last month at a church over federal immigration raids in the US state of Minnesota.Lemon, 59, was charged with conspiracy to deprive rights and interfering with religious freedoms by allegedly obstructing someone's First Amendment rights by force.He was arrested after entering the Cities Church in St Paul on 18 January with protesters who said one of its pastors was an immigration enforcement official.He livestreamed the protest in an incident that resulted in charges for eight other people.Lemon did not speak as he entered the courtroom on Friday in St Paul, where two dozen protesters were gathered to support him, chanting \"[Attorney General] Pam Bondi has got to go\", according to the Associated Press. Four co-defendants who were there with Lemon also pleaded not guilty. Lemon has defended his decision to enter the church, saying he was simply carrying out his duty as an independent journalist covering a protest. \"I have spent my entire career covering the news. I will not stop now,\" he said soon after he was arrested. During Friday's hearing, one of Lemon's lawyers, Abbe Lowell, expressed concerns to the judge that investigators had taken Lemon's mobile phone when they arrested him in Los Angeles late last month, according to US media. Lemon and eight other co-defendants, including another journalist, have been charged with conspiracy against religious freedom at a place of worship and injuring, intimidating and interfering with the exercise of the right of religious freedom at a place of worship.In the 18 January incident, protesters interrupted a service the church by chanting \"ICE out\" and \"Justice for Renee Good\", the mother of three who was fatally shot by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer last month in Minneapolis. Lemon has said he was there as a journalist and not affiliated with the church protestors. Footage showed a chaotic scene unfolding inside the church, which belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention, as protesters and members of the congregation shout at each other.Federal agents killed a second protester, intensive care nurse Alex Pretti, in Minneapolis two weeks later. Both Pretti and Good were killed as they were protesting against the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts in Minnesota, an operation that has since ended. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in a social media post after Lemon's arrest that \"Trump will not tolerate the intimidation and harassment of Christians in their sacred places of worship\". A longstanding Trump critic, Lemon was fired from CNN in April 2023 after 17 years with the broadcaster. The morning show host had apologised for on-air comments that Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, then 51, was past her prime.ICE protester speaks out after White House shared fake arrest image",

    "body": "2 days agoMax MatzaGetty ImagesKathryn Ruemmler appears on a news programme in 2014Goldman Sachs' top lawyer, Kathryn Ruemmler, has announced she will step down from her role after months of pressure over her friendship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Emails disclosed by the US justice department show she referred to the disgraced financier in emails as \"Uncle Jeffrey\", advised him on how to push back against media and accepted luxury gifts from him.\"My responsibility is to put Goldman Sachs' interests first,\" Ruemmler, who previously served as White House counsel to former US President Barack Obama, said in a statement.Goldman CEO David Solomon thanked her for \"sound advice\". Her resignation will take effect from 30 June.\"Throughout her tenure, Kathy has been an extraordinary general counsel, and we are grateful for her contributions,\" Solomon said in a statement.\"Kathy has also been a mentor and friend to many of our people, and she will be missed. I accepted her resignation, and I respect her decision.\"There is no suggestion that appearing in the millions of documents related to Epstein that have been released in the US implies any criminal wrongdoing. But the drip of revelations became a public relations headache for the Wall Street bank, where Ruemmler led its reputational risk committee. She joined Goldman in 2020.Ruemmler said in a statement to news agency Reuters earlier this month: \"I got to know him [Epstein] as a lawyer and that was the foundation of my relationship with him.\"I had no knowledge of any ongoing criminal conduct on his part, and I did not know him as the monster he has been revealed to be.\"The BBC has contacted Ruemmler for comment.Emails show she had a large number of communications with Epstein between 2014 and 2019, when she was in private practice after leaving the White House.Epstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a child and died while in custody facing sex trafficking charges in 2019.In one December 2015 email exchange, Ruemmler wrote to a redacted recipient. \"I adore him [Epstein]. It's like having another older brother!\"That message came after Epstein offered to buy her a first-class ticket to Europe, according to the BBC's US news partner CBS.Her exit from Goldman follows the release of handwritten notes from a law enforcement official who participated in Epstein's sex trafficking arrest in July 2019.The notes suggest that, on the night he was taken into custody, Epstein called Ruemmler, whose mobile phone number is redacted in the documents.She has said she never represented Epstein as a legal client.Communications from March 2019, four months before Epstein's arrest, show Ruemmler advising him on how to push back against media scrutiny that his 2008 plea deal was too lenient.\"Far from [receiving] a sweetheart deal, Mr Epstein was subjected to a lengthy, aggressive, [and] highly unusual federal investigation for what were, in essence, local [offences] of sexual solicitation,\" Ruemmler wrote.She suggests arguing that Epstein was being persecuted due to his \"wealth\".The emails also show that Epstein lavished Ruemmler with gifts, including flowers, wine, a Hermès bag, $10,000 (£7,300) in Bergdorf Goodman gift cards and an Apple watch.\"Am totally tricked out by Uncle Jeffrey today! Jeffrey boots, handbag, and watch!\" Ruemmler wrote in a 2019 message.Last month, a Goldman spokesman played down the gifts, saying: \"It's well known that Epstein often offered unsolicited favours and gifts to his many business contacts.\"Ruemmler's departure is the latest corporate resignation linked to the latest Epstein disclosures.Last week, Brad Karp, the chairman of prestigious US law firm Paul Weiss, stepped down after emails revealed he discussed Epstein's 2008 conviction with him.",

    "body": "13 hours agoAFP via Getty ImagesThe $1.6m (£1.2m) trial was funded by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (stock image)A now-halted plan to run a hepatitis B vaccine trial involving thousands of newborns in Guinea-Bissau has been criticised by the World Health Organization as \"unethical\".The US-funded study had sought to give one set of babies the vaccine at birth, while another would have had the shot delayed until six weeks of age. The WHO said it had \"significant concerns\" about the plan, and described the birth-dose vaccine as \"an effective and essential public health intervention, with a proven record\".The US health department, headed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has questioned the effects of vaccines, had sought to use the trial to answer questions about the jab's broader health effects.The WHO said on Friday that its concerns regarded the study's scientific justification, ethical safeguards and consistency with established standards for research involving humans.It stressed that the jab had been used for more than three decades in more than 115 countries.The WHO said giving a proven life-saving intervention to some newborns but not others exposed them to \"potentially irreversible harm\".A sizeable portion of Guinea-Bissau's population is estimated to have hepatitis B, and the WHO says vaccination at birth prevents the virus being transmitted from mother to baby in 70-95% of cases.It argued that trials giving one group a placebo or not treating them were only acceptable when no proven treatment existed, something that was not the case with the hepatitis B birth dose vaccine.The WHO recommends that all newborns receive the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth. It says infection at birth is the most common way of having a lifelong infection, with 90% of infected newborns becoming chronic carriers.In Guinea-Bissau, the dose is currently given at six weeks, though authorities plan to introduce the birth dose nationwide by 2028 to align with global standards, something the WHO said it would help accelerate.A total of 14,000 babies in the West African country were due to be involved in the study funded by the US and led by Danish researchers.But public outrage at the project prompted the Guinea-Bissau government to suspend it last month. 'We are not guinea pigs'Critics have questioned why babies in the African country were being proposed for the trial.Two months ago, a panel of top advisers voted to stop recommending that all newborns in the US receive a hepatitis B vaccine.Kennedy has on several occasions denied being against vaccinations and has said he and his children had been vaccinated, but has also repeatedly stated widely debunked claims about vaccine harms.Vocal opponents of the project in Guinea-Bissau include the country's former health minister, Magda Robalo.Most people with the virus do not have any symptoms, or have very mild symptoms.But some people can experience jaundice, dark urine, feeling very tired, nausea, vomiting and pain in the abdomen.The WHO says chronic patients have a high risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "16 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykReutersProminent US agent Casey Wasserman is selling his talent company after documents linking him to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell were published in the US.Several high-profile clients, including singer Chappell Roan, quit the firm this week after it emerged he flew on Epstein's private plane and exchanged flirtatious emails with Maxwell in 2003.Wasserman said in an company-wide email sent on Friday that he had \"become a distraction\" as he announced he has begun the process to sell the major LA-based agency.The 51-year-old, who has also resisted calls to stand down from his role as chair of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, previously said he had no \"personal or business relationship\" with Epstein.\"I'm deeply sorry that my past personal mistakes have caused you so much discomfort,\" Wasserman wrote to the agency's 4,000 employees in the email, which was obtained by the BBC.He continued: \"It's not fair to you, and it's not fair to the clients and partners we represent so vigorously and care so deeply about.\"Wasserman said he \"deeply regrets\" his discussions with Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for facilitating the sexual abuse of teenage girls by Epstein. He said his email exchanges with Maxwell \"took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light\".Wasserman has not been accused of wrongdoing by any of Epstein's victims and the appearance of his name in the files does not imply criminal activity of any kind.Earlier this week, LA28 said Wasserman would remain chairman of the 2028 games after organisers reviewed his past interactions with Maxwell. They found his relationship did not go further than the exchanges that had already been documented and that he had fully co-operated with an investigation. The LA28 board said in a statement that Wasserman and his then-wife flew on a humanitarian mission to Africa on Epstein's plane at the invitation of the Clinton Foundation in 2003.The board said the journey was long before \"Wasserman or the public knew of Epstein and Maxwell's deplorable crimes\". \"This was his single interaction with Epstein. Shortly after, he traded the publicly-known emails with Maxwell,\" the statement continued.A number of stars have have walked away from Wasserman's agency in recent days.She said: \"No artist, agent or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values.\"Roan did not specifically mention the Epstein-related documents in her statement. Other musical artists have announced their plans to exit Wasserman's agency, including country music singer-songwriter Orville Peck, North Carolina-based rock band Wednesday, and singer-songwriter Weyes Blood. Former US football player Abby Wambach also said she was leaving the agency, saying: \"I know what I know and I am following my gut and values. I will not participate in any business arrangement under his leadership.\"",

    "body": "An abduction, a Bitcoin demand and a TV icon - why Nancy Guthrie's case has gripped the US3 hours agoDavid WillisTucson, ArizonaGetty ImagesBefore the sun rose over a barren desert landscape, YouTuber Jimmy Williams watched as hundreds of subscribers took to his online chat room.A laptop balanced precariously on his knees, his iPhone framed by a ring light, he spends several hours a day dissecting the details of Nancy Guthrie's sudden disappearance with his rapidly growing audience of fellow true crime enthusiasts.Nancy Guthrie disappeared from her home in Tucson, Arizona, and authorities believe she was taken against her will in the early hours of 1 February.Williams is just one of dozens of curious observers and amateur sleuths who have descended on the area.The influx of spectators has turned a quiet mid-size city, popular with retirees, into a global media spectacle.Police have yet to identify any suspects in her abduction, and her daughter – the Today show presenter Savannah Guthrie – has repeatedly begged the public for help in finding her mother.A reassuring face on morning television in the US, Savannah Guthrie now finds herself at the same intersection of hope and dread that has defined many of her interviewees.This time, however, the roles have been reversed, and instead of asking questions she is the one awaiting answers.Breakfast television affords its presenters a special sense of intimacy with their audience, with segments often focusing on human-interest stories.Savannah Guthrie spent her childhood in Tucson, and in November she even invited people into her mum's home for a segment on the Today Show.Kelly Himes lives several miles from Nancy Guthrie's home in the shadow of the Catalina Mountains. Like a growing number of Tucson residents, she felt compelled to stop and say a prayer alongside the growing array of flowers at the end of her driveway.\"Nancy's the same age as my mum, the same height as my mum, and she's got the same hair,\" Himes told the BBC. \"She lives alone just like my mum does. This is someone who could be anybody's mother.\"Savannah Guthrie's fame has proved to be a double-edged sword. As well as drawing an unprecedented amount of attention and resources to the search for her mother, it has also inspired feverish speculation and given rise to a string of false leads.Getty ImagesTwo weeks after Nancy Guthrie's disappearance investigators revealed they had found several gloves, with the closest discovered about two miles from her home.The sheriff's department also said media reports that a glove was found inside her home or on the property were inaccurate.To Williams' growing audience speculation over the case only heightens its intrigue.Since Nancy Guthrie's disappearance, Williams' YouTube channel Dollyvision has gained more than 8,000 new subscribers.Interest in Nancy's disappearance was \"massive\", he said.\"You expect kidnappings to involve cash in a bag dropped off somewhere remote, and then the police turn up and arrest everyone. This is different. This is like a 'new age' of kidnapping.\"The days of ransom demands made up of letters cut from the pages of a magazine seem a thing of the past.Secure servers, secret IP addresses and untraceable Bitcoin accounts have changed the face of one of the world's oldest crimes, but a former FBI hostage negotiator, Chip Massey, said he believed Nancy Guthrie's kidnappers would soon be caught.Referring to the video images of a masked man on her doorstep shortly before she disappeared, he said somebody somewhere would recognise the suspect based either on their behaviour or their body language.\"The attention this case has generated is unprecedented,\" he said, \"and while a mask can conceal a face it can't conceal a person.\"Getty ImagesMissing person flyers featuring pictures of Nancy's smiling face, combined with motorway billboards promoting the FBI's tip line have made this case impossible to ignore, even for those who don't watch the news. The White House said the FBI would be giving the investigation its \"full resources\".\"So many people now seem to be engaged with this search that it is going to very hard for this individual to function. That sort of scrutiny makes it impossible for a suspect to move, and creates a sense of the world 'closing in' on them. That's when they start to make mistakes,\" Massey said.Yellow ribbons now adorn the trees around Nancy Guthrie's home,  but as days pass with no word of her whereabouts the hope of an emotional homecoming is rapidly giving way to a deepening sense of dread.",

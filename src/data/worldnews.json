    "body": "Murder and MI5: How an extraordinary battle erupted over what the state keeps secret12 hours agoDaniel De SimoneInvestigations correspondent BBCPaul Thompson was shot dead while being driven home in a taxi through Belfast in April 1994. He was murdered in a sectarian attack by loyalist paramilitaries who had set out to kill Catholics.The taxi driver was a friend who was collecting a fare at another address in the Springfield Park area in the west of the city. But no one at the address had rung the taxi firm. The call is suspected to have been a deliberate decoy by the killers who wanted to lure a taxi as prey. Paul was not specifically targeted. They could not have known he would ask for a lift or be in the area.One resident described hearing a heavy burst of gunfire after 23:00, running to the car and finding Paul.Members of a banned loyalist terror group, the Ulster Defence Association, using the cover name Ulster Freedom Fighters, claimed responsibility for the killing. During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the group repeatedly murdered Catholic civilians like Paul.Family Handout/PA WireMembers of a banned loyalist terror group, the Ulster Defence Association, using the cover name Ulster Freedom Fighters, claimed responsibility for killing Paul, who was nicknamed TopperOn the morning of the day that Paul was killed, locals had told police about a hole in a barrier – known as the 'Peace Line' – which separated the largely Catholic Springfield Park area from a largely Protestant neighbouring area. The residents were concerned the breach could give loyalist paramilitaries access to launch an attack.The hole was not fixed. After the murder, those responsible escaped through it.An inquest into Paul's death was opened in 1995 but never concluded. No-one has ever been held to account. There has never been a full investigation.Left by themselves to fight for answers, his mother Margaret and brother Eugene, both now dead, came to suspect collusion between British security forces and informants – meaning state agents - in the group responsible.In 2024, a coroner decided to release to the family a summary of secret information held by the police. This was said by the coroner to be of central relevance to the case and the police supported the move. But the British government and MI5 argued this would prejudice national security and mounted a legal challenge.PA MediaPaul Thompson was killed by the UDA, which used the cover name of the Ulster Freedom FightersThe case, which centred on who had the power to decide to release the information, reached the Supreme Court last summer, with Paul Thompson's brother, Eugene, tuning in to hearings from a hospice, as he neared death from cancer.The case is widely viewed as a major test of the state's policy of neither confirming nor denying (NCND) information involving national security.Who decides what is secret?The NCND policy is a position adopted by the government and security services when responding to questions about sensitive matters. It means there will be no confirmation, no denial, and no acknowledgement that the information requested is true, false, or even exists.Eugene Thompson's barrister, Monye Anyadike-Danes KC, said the family had concluded the murder happened because the authorities were colluding with the \"very group that actually perpetrated the killing\". She said Eugene was \"trying to find out why his younger brother was murdered\" and felt a \"deep responsibility\".PA MediaEugene Thompson, who has since died, spent years trying to find out the truth about his brother's deathEugene, she added, believed the public should be able to trust that those who kill will be held accountable, especially when they are agents of the state. She asked the judges not to let the NCND policy be used to \"conceal the involvement of state parties in the killing of an ordinary citizen\".Just before Christmas, the court ruled that the government's assessment of damage to national security \"should have been accepted by the coroner\" unless it was plainly irrational or there was no supporting evidence.The justices found the coroner had failed to understand it was \"solely\" for the government to make submissions on national security, not the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), Jon Boutcher, who had argued for the release of the summary of police files.PA WireJon Boutcher argued for the release of the summary of police filesPaul Thompson's case is part of a battle over the truth and whether it can be told. The battle concerns official secrets, often connected to state agents, and it pits bereaved families and senior police officers against the government and the security service, MI5.It raises a profound question: can the state, especially when it is implicated in killing, be trusted as the arbiter of what should remain secret?The spycatcher who was himself a spyOther cases in the coming months will force these issues further into the spotlight – and they come at a time when MI5's integrity is under significant scrutiny.Yet the Supreme Court's ruling in the Thompson case creates a precedent that says the government and MI5 can withhold information from bereaved families, for national security reasons, even when the police want it to be disclosed.Grainne Teggart, from Amnesty International, described it as a \"grim day for truth\" and part of a pattern of \"national security being used as a shield to cover up and conceal the state's role in very serious crimes such as murder and other serious human rights violations.\"The government, by contrast, welcomed the court's \"unanimous judgment\".\"This is a highly complex case with wide-ranging implications,\" it said. \"The government will therefore take time to fully consider all aspects of this judgment.\"The Supreme Court's ruling in the Thompson case has created a precedentDuring the Troubles, the state made widespread use of informants, otherwise known as agents, who were tasked with carrying out actions and often paid. Agents existed in the IRA and in loyalist paramilitary groups. They were run by the police, the army, and MI5.The former Met Police chief Lord Stevens, who led UK government-commissioned investigations into collusion in Northern Ireland between the 1980s and 2000s, once said that of 210 people arrested during his enquiries, only three were not state agents.Collusion occurred in a number of ways, he said, ranging from the state withholding intelligence and evidence from investigators, to state agents being involved in murder. In some cases agents told the authorities in advance about planned attacks but nothing was done to stop them.One of the most notorious agents was codenamed Stakeknife. It has been publicly known for more than 20 years that Stakeknife was a man called Freddie Scappaticci. He died under MI5 protection in 2023 having never been charged with any of the many murders and other crimes to which he is linked.Pacemaker Press/ PAFreddie Scappaticci, or Stakeknife, died under MI5 protection in 2023Scappaticci was a senior figure in the IRA's internal security unit, which was tasked by IRA leaders with identifying and killing British agents in the organisation. But, with the spycatcher himself a spy, the result was one British agent killing other agents, or people accused of being agents, and the state repeatedly not intervening to save them.Intelligence agencies and historic wrongdoingA long-running police investigation into Stakeknife, Operation Kenova, was forbidden from officially naming Scappaticci in its final report, published in December, despite the fact that his identity was widely known.The head of the Kenova team, Sir Iain Livingstone, pleaded with Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn for the right to name Scappaticci in his report, but Benn said he would decide after the Supreme Court ruling in the Paul Thompson case, which came later in December.That ruling has, in effect, strengthened Benn's power to stop him being named. If permission is granted, a revised version of the Kenova report can be published.Jon Boutcher, who was Livingstone's predecessor leading the Kenova investigation, has described the situation preventing Scappaticci being named as a \"pantomime\". It leads to the truth being \"suppressed,\" he argues, with \"profound and severe adverse impacts on victims and families, legitimate public discussion and debate, media freedom, open justice and public confidence in state agencies and the criminal justice system\".PA WireThe integrity of MI5, which is currently led by Sir Ken McCallum, is under scrutinyBoutcher, the PSNI chief constable, is involved in a significant and extraordinary stand-off with the government and MI5 over NCND.He has called for reform of the policy, a principle he fully supports but believes is being wrongly applied and has become a dogma that can be used to conceal wrongdoing.He has recommended the policy is reviewed to ensure it is applied proportionately and only where genuinely necessary for the protection of life or national security. The government has not yet responded to the call for a review of the policy.Boutcher has directly asked whether NCND's continued application on Stakeknife amounts to it being used as a tool for covering up things that should never have happened.\"I question whether this decision protects agents, or rather does it actually protect the government and intelligence agencies from accountability for historical wrongdoing.\"More from InDepthIn the Paul Thompson case he argued that he, as chief constable, rather than the government, had the right to allow the coroner to release a summary of police files. The high court and court of appeal backed his position before it was ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court.During the hearings, government barrister Sir James Eadie KC said Boutcher was being \"thoroughly disingenuous\" and that \"politics is being played with national security\". He argued the government is best placed to make assessments on national security, as only it has access to the full range of necessary advice. The principal advice, in this context, is from MI5.The argument the government is best informed seemed somewhat at odds with the fact the MI5 officer whose sworn statement was provided to support the case had not read the relevant underlying material.For the chief constable of Northern Ireland to be at loggerheads with MI5 is \"unprecedented\" says veteran investigative journalist, John Ware, who has reported on the Troubles since the 1970s.\"If anybody had told me even 10 years ago that there would come a time when the chief constable of the PSNI and the Security Service were at loggerheads, I would have fallen off my stool,\" he says.Trust, state secrecy and the publicBoutcher has a raised a stark question: can the authorities who played a role in the events, including MI5, be trusted to decide whether to tell the public about what happened, when doing so could leave them exposed?He has also indirectly raised this question about the legal system itself - due to its own role in the Stakeknife case.Scappaticci helped create a legal precedent on state secrecy that is routinely cited by the government to this day.In 2003, he sought a judicial review over the then government's refusal to publicly deny media reports that he was Stakeknife.But Scappaticci was bluffing and did not actually want to succeed, since if the government was ordered to tell the truth, he would have been confirmed as Stakeknife. Scappaticci was engaged in a pretence to help shore up his reputation: publicly fighting a legal case, while hoping – and expecting – he would lose.VCG via Getty ImagesMany families of those killed or injured in the Troubles are still fighting through the courtsHowever, the government feared Scappaticci would win because a judge would assume he was not Stakeknife and force ministers to be honest.Jon Boutcher has now confirmed an extraordinary fact: the judge who heard the case did so after being secretly briefed on the real identity of Stakeknife.That judge, the then Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, Lord Carswell, ultimately allowed the government to maintain NCND, creating the legal precedent on the policy.\"The full facts about this and the government's explanation will never be known while it is able to hide behind the shield of NCND,\" Boutcher has said.There is a second extraordinary fact: the government barrister who did the secret briefing was Philip Sales, who as Lord Sales was one of the Supreme Court justices in the Paul Thompson case. This fact was uncovered by the journalist John Ware.This is an issue because it is Lord Sales' ruling in the Thompson case which has a central bearing over whether Scappaticci can be named and more details revealed about what went on, including Lord Sales' own role.I asked the Supreme Court whether, given Lord Sales' role in the Scappaticci matter, if it was appropriate for him to have heard the Thompson case.In a statement, the court said: \"Great care is taken in the selection of the panels which will hear a case at the UK Supreme Court.\"A Justice will not deal with a case where it is considered there is a conflict of interest and individual Justices are careful to ensure that they have none.\"The cases of Seamus Dillon and Sean BrownTwo further cases that touch on the potential release of information about the role of the state during the Troubles are also before the Supreme Court.Troubles-related inquests were shut down in 2024 with the passing of the Legacy Act, which created a new body called the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) to examine relevant cases, including those being investigated by police.The families of four men who were either killed or injured during the Troubles won a further legal victory, when the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal ruled the government has too much veto power over the disclosure of material by the ICRIR.Lady Chief Justice Siobhan Keegan said that the provision in the Act giving the Northern Ireland secretary \"the final say\" on disclosure of sensitive national security information by the ICRIR would risk undermining public confidence in the body.The UK government's appeal will be ruled on by the Supreme Court in the coming months. The lead respondent in the case is Martina Dillon, whose husband Seamus was killed in 1997.PA WireMartina Dillon's husband Seamus was killed in 1997 by the paramilitary Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF)The paramilitary Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) claimed responsibility. A coroner had opened an inquest on the basis there was evidence of collusion by state authorities, but the inquest was halted by the Legacy Act. No-one has ever been held accountable.The government has also registered an appeal in another key case.Sean Brown was also murdered in 1997 by members of the LVF. The 61-year-old father-of-six was abducted as he locked the gates at a sports club in County Londonderry. There were investigative failures by police and no-one has been brought to justice.PA MediaSean Brown, a father of six, was abducted as he locked the gates at a sports clubDecades later, a coroner issued a summary of secret material stating that \"a number of the individuals linked through intelligence to the murder were agents of the state.\" Sean's family want a public inquiry, and have won judgments over the past two years at the High Court and Court of Appeal. The government, which was found to have acted unlawfully by refusing a public inquiry, has registered an appeal to the Supreme Court on the basis the issue has constitutional significance regarding who should order inquiries.'The state viewed itself as above the law'At its heart, this vast battle over secrecy centres on two core claims by the state: that only the government and MI5 can ultimately be fully trusted on national security, and that their decisions on what information to release are solely about protecting the public.But these claims have been undermined by MI5's actions and omissions in several recent cases, all during the leadership of MI5's current director general, Sir Ken McCallum.A public inquiry into the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, which killed 22 people, concluded that MI5 had not given an \"accurate picture\" of the key intelligence it held about the suicide bomber who carried out the attack. The inquiry chairman only uncovered what MI5 had done through his own persistent investigations during secret evidence sessions.The government has been resisting calls by families bereaved by the Manchester Arena attack for MI5 officers to be fully included in planned new legislation - known as the Hillsborough Law - that's designed to stop cover-ups and enforce truth-telling by public officials.Getty ImagesA public inquiry into the Manchester Arena bombing concluded that MI5 had not given an \"accurate picture\" of key intelligence it heldAnother ongoing case is an example of how MI5's evidence cannot always be taken at face value: MI5 gave false evidence to three courts about having maintained its NCND secrecy policy in relation to an abusive neo-Nazi agent who attacked his girlfriend with a machete. But MI5 had in fact told me the man was an agent when attempting to prevent me from investigating him. After MI5 apologised, we then showed that inquiries into what happened by MI5 and the government were deficient and unreliable, with further falsehoods provided to the court. This prompted the most senior judge in England and Wales to dismiss MI5's explanations and led the prime minister to order a new investigation, which will report this year.In the Stakeknife investigation, MI5 disclosed key documents years after enquiries began, aer Scappaticci had died and charging decisions had been made, and at a point when the Legacy Act banned police from investigating further. The new material revealed MI5 had greater and earlier knowledge of Stakeknife than detectives had previously been told, including that MI5 had been involved in tasking him. The lead detective said it was a \"significant failure on the part of MI5\". A review commissioned by MI5 found no deliberate wrongdoing.Cover-ups and failures to disclose information have a long history in Northern Ireland. Lord Stevens, recalling his investigations, has said: \"I was misled deliberately, I was criminally obstructed from doing my job by the Royal Ulster Constabulary and military, whilst MI5 failed to disclose information.\"Judge Pomerance, who was senior counsel on another major investigation, concluded bluntly: \"The state viewed itself as above the law\".The battle of bereaved familiesLast July, days before Eugene Thompson died, Jon Boutcher delivered a letter of apology on behalf of PSNI. He apologised for the police's failure to take action that may have prevented Paul Thompson's murder, and for failures in the investigation, including not properly pursuing suspects.Mark Thompson from Relatives for Justice (no relation of Paul and Eugene Thompson) says the apology was \"important\" but that Eugene was by this stage \"very ill\".Thompson familyJust before he died, Eugene Thompson (right) received an apology for police failings over the murder of his brother Paul (left). Their mother Margaret is also picturedMark had watched the Supreme Court hearings with Eugene on a laptop in his hospice and describes the experience as \"tough\". Eugene was \"praying and hoping that before he died the judgment could be made\", Mark says.Bereaved families caught up in these cases have had to battle for decades, trying to fill voids left by the lack of proper investigations by the state.\"You became an investigator, tracking down witnesses. You became an expert in the law in that field. And you fought your own case tooth and nail.\"Eugene Thompson became an \"accidental lawyer and expert in his own case\", he says, as he campaigned for answers about why his brother Paul was murdered.\"I think if we take anything from the legacy of him, it's the example of never giving up.\"Top image credit: PA MediaEmail: security.investigations@bbc.co.ukSignal: @investigation.56Click here to learn how to use SecureDrop, an anonymous whistleblowing tool that works only in the Tor browser and follow the advice to stay secure.BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "As the world inches back to a pre-WW2 order, the 'middle powers' face a grave new challenge2 days agoAllan LittleSenior correspondentBBCI had been asked to give a keynote speech at a conference at Columbia University's Journalism School. It was January 2002. Two planes had been flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center months earlier and you could still feel how wounded the city felt. You could read it in the faces of New Yorkers you spoke to.In my speech I made a few opening remarks about what the United States had meant to me. \"I was born 15 years after the Second World War,\" I said, \"in a world America made. The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement.\"American military might had won the war in the West, I continued. It had stopped the further westward expansion of Soviet power.I talked briefly about the transformational effect of the Marshall Plan, through which the US had given Europe the means to rebuild its shattered economies, and to re-establish the institutions of democracy.AFP via Getty Images'I was born 15 years after the Second World War in a world America made,' Allan Little told an audience. 'The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement'I told the audience, composed mostly of students of journalism, that as a young reporter I had myself witnessed the inspiring culmination of all this in 1989 when I'd stood in Wenceslas Square in Prague. Back then I'd watched, awestruck, as Czechs and Slovaks demanded an end to Soviet occupation, and to a hated Communist dictatorship, so that they too could be part of the community of nations that we called, simply, \"the West\", bound together by shared values, at the head of which sat the the United States of America.I looked up from my notes at the faces of the audience. Near the front of the lecture hall sat a young man. He looked about 20. Tears were running down his face and he was quietly trying to suppress a sob.At a drinks reception afterwards he approached me. \"I'm sorry I lost it in there,\" he said. \"Your words: right now we are feeling raw and vulnerable. America needs to hear this stuff from its foreign friends.\"In that moment I thought how lucky my generation - and his - had been, to be alive in an era in which the international system was regulated by rules - a world that had turned its back on the unconstrained power of the Great Powers.Getty ImagesDonald Trump believes the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too longBut it was the words of one of his classmates that come back to me now. He had arrived in New York just a few days before 9/11 from his native Pakistan to study at Columbia. He likened the US to Imperial Rome.\"If you are lucky enough to live within the walls of the imperial citadel, which is to say here in the US, you experience American power as something benign. It protects you and your property. It bestows freedom by upholding the rule of law. It is accountable to the people through democratic institutions.\"But if, like me, you live on the barbarian fringes of Empire, you experience American power as something quite different. It can do anything to you, with impunity... And you can't stop it or hold it to account.\"His words made me consider the much heralded rules-based international order from another angle: from the point of view of much of the Global South. And how its benefits have never been universally distributed, something that the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reminded an audience at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, last week.ReutersCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech in Davos called for 'the middle powers' to act together\"We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false,\" Carney said. \"That the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient. That trade rules were enforced asymmetrically. And we knew that international law applied with varying rigour depending on the identity of the accused or victim.\"Back in Columbia University, all those years ago, the student from Pakistan had asked me a question. \"Don't you find it interesting,\" he said, \"that the US, the country that came into existence in a revolt against the arbitrary exercise of [British] power is, in our day, the most powerful exponent of arbitrary power?\"A new world order or back to the future?Donald Trump came to Davos last week clearly determined to bend the Europeans to his will over Greenland. He wanted ownership, he said.He declared that Denmark had only \"added one more dog sled\" to defend the territory. That speaks volumes to the undisguised contempt with which he and many in his inner circle appear to hold certain European allies.\"I fully share your loathing of European freeloading,\" Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told a group on messaging app Signal that included Vice-President JD Vance last year, adding \"PATHETIC\". (He hadn't realised that the Editor of The Atlantic magazine had apparently been added to the group chat.)Then President Trump himself told Fox News recently that, during the war in Afghanistan, Nato had sent \"some troops\" but that they had \"stayed a little back, a little off the front lines\".The comments provoked anger among UK politicians and veterans' families. The UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer branded Trump's remarks \"insulting and frankly appalling\".The UK prime minister spoke to Trump on Saturday, after which the US president used his Truth Social platform to praise UK troops as being \"among the greatest of all warriors\".Carl Court - Pool/Getty ImagesSir Keir Starmer said US President Donald Trump's remarks about Nato troops in Afghanistan were 'insulting and frankly appalling'We know from the White House's National Security Strategy, published in December, that in his second term, Trump intends to unshackle the US from the system of transnational bodies created, in part by Washington, to regulate international affairs. That document spells out the means by which the US will put \"America First\" at the heart of US security strategy by using whatever powers they have - ranging from economic sanctions and trade tariffs to military intervention - to bend smaller and weaker nations into alignment with US interests.It is a strategy which privileges strength - a return to a world in which the Great Powers carve out spheres of influence.The danger in this for what Canada's prime minister called \"the middle powers\" is clear. \"If you're not at the table,\" he said, \"you're on the menu.\"Re-interpretation of the Monroe DoctrineIn Davos last week, America's allies, especially Canada and Europe, were laying to rest what is now commonly called the rules-based international order, and in some cases mourning its demise.But, as the young Pakistani student at Columbia journalism school argued all those years ago, to large parts of the rest of the world it has not seemed, in the last 80 years, that the US, and on occasions some of its friends, felt restrained by rules.More from InDepth\"After World War Two, we saw, under the so-called rules-based international order multiple interventions by the United States in Latin America,\" says Dr Christopher Sabatini, Senior Research Fellow for Latin America at Chatham House think tank in London.\"It's not new. There are patterns of intervention that go all the way back to 1823. There's a term I use for American policymakers who advocate for unilateral US intervention. I call them \"backyard-istas\" - those who see Latin America as their backyard.\"In 1953, the CIA, assisted by the British Secret Intelligence Services, orchestrated a coup that overthrew the government of Mohammad Mossadeq in Iran. He had wanted to audit the books of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later part of BP), and when it refused to co-operate, Mossadeq threatened to nationalise it.For posing a threat to British economic interests, he was overthrown and Britain and the US threw their weight behind the increasingly dictatorial shah.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesThe CIA played a key role in the 1953 coup which ousted Iran's democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammad MossadeqAt the same time, the US was conspiring to overthrow the elected government of Guatemala, which had implemented an ambitious programme of land reform that threatened to harm the profitability of the American United Fruit Company. Again with active CIA collusion, the left-wing President Jacobo Arbenz was toppled and replaced by a series of US-backed authoritarian rulers.In 1983 the US invaded the Caribbean island of Grenada, after a Marxist coup. This was a country of which the late Queen, Elizabeth II, was head of state.And the US invaded Panama in 1989, and arrested the military leader Manuel Noriega. He spent all but the last few months of his life in prison.These interventions were all functions of the Monroe Doctrine, first promulgated by President James Monroe in 1823. It asserted America's right to dominate the Western hemisphere and keep European powers from trying to meddle in the newly independent states of Latin America. The post-war rules-based international order did not deter the US from imposing its will on weaker neighbours.Getty Images / CorbisPanama's leader Manuel Noriega was forcibly removed by US troops in 1989 and spent almost all of the rest of his life in jailWhen it was announced by the fifth president of the US, James Monroe, the doctrine that bears his name was widely seen as an expression of US solidarity with its neighbours, a strategy to protect them from attempts by the European great powers to recolonise them. The US, after all, shared with them a set of republican values and a history of anti-colonial struggle.But the doctrine quickly became an assertion of Washington's right to dominate its neighbours and use any means, up to and including military intervention, to bend their policies into alignment with American interests. President Theodore Roosevelt, in 1904, said it gave the US \"international police power\" to intervene in countries where there was \"wrongdoing\".So could it be that President Trump's re-interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine is simply part of a continuum in US foreign policy?Getty ImagesThe Monroe Doctrine was first promulgated by US President James Monroe (pictured) in 1823\"The Guatemala coup, in 1954 - that was entirely owned by the US. They orchestrated the entire takeover of the country,\" says Christopher Sabatini.The 1973 coup in Chile against left-wing Prime Minister Salvador Allende \"wasn't orchestrated by the CIA but the United States said it would accept a coup\", he added.During the Cold War, the main motivation for intervention was the perception that Soviet-backed parties were gaining ground domestically, representing Communist advances into the Western hemisphere. In our own day, the perceived enemy is no longer Communism, but drug-trafficking and migration.That difference aside, President Trump's reassertion of the Monroe Doctrine \"absolutely is 'back to the future',\" says the historian Jay Sexton, author of The Monroe Doctrine: Empire and Nation in Nineteenth Century America.Getty ImagesGuatamalan President Jacobo Arbenz was overthrown by a US-backed coup in 1954\"The other thing that gives Trump's United States a 19th-Century feel is his unpredictability, his volatility. Observers could never really predict what the US would do next.\"We don't know what the future holds but we do known from even a cursory look at modern history, from 1815 onwards [the end of the Napoleonic wars], that Great Power rivalries are really destabilising. They lead to conflict.\"Cohesion among the alliesAmerican unilateralism may not be new. What is new is that this time, it is America's friends and allies that find themselves on the receiving end of American power.Suddenly, Europeans and Canadians are getting a taste of something long familiar to other parts of the world - that arbitrary exercise of US power that the young Pakistani journalism student articulated so clearly to me in the weeks after 9/11.For the first year of his second term, European leaders used flattery in their approach to Trump. Starmer, for example, had King Charles invite him to make a second state visit to the UK, an honour no other US president in history has been granted. The Secretary-General of Nato, Mark Rutte, referred to him, bizarrely, as \"daddy\".Getty ImagesKing Charles invited Donald Trump to make a second state visit to the UK - an honour no other US president has received (photo from first state visit in 2019)But Trump's approach towards Europe brought him clear success. Previous presidents, including Barack Obama and Joe Biden, also believed European allies were not pulling their weight in Nato - the collective trans-Atlantic defence alliance - and wanted them to spend more on their own security. Only Trump succeeded in making them act. In response to his threats, they agreed to raise their defence spending from around 2% of GDP to 5%, something unthinkable even a year ago.Greenland, however, seems to have been a game-changer. When Trump threatened Danish sovereignty in Greenland, the allies began to cohere around a new-found defiance, and resolved not, this time, to bend.Canada's prime minister gave voice to this moment. In his pivotal speech in Davos Mark Carney said this was a moment of \"rupture\" with the old rules-based international order - in the new world of Great Power politics, \"the middle powers\" needed to act together.Getty ImagesPrevious US presidents had also believed the European allies should spend more on their own security - only Trump succeeded in making them actIt is rare, at Davos, for an audience to rise to its feet and award a speaker with a standing ovation. But they did it for Carney, and you felt, in that moment, a cohesion forming among the allies.And in an instant, the threat of tariffs lifted. Trump has gained nothing over Greenland that the US hasn't already had for decades - the right, with Denmark's blessing, to build military bases, stage unlimited personnel there, and even to mineral exploitation.The challenge facing 'middle powers' todayThere is no doubt that Trump's America-First strategy is popular with his Maga base. They share his view that the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too long. And European leaders, in agreeing to increase their defence spending, have accepted that President Trump was right: that the imbalance was no longer fair or sustainable.ReutersIn June 2004 I reported on the celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy. There were still many living World War Two veterans and thousands of those who had crossed the Channel 60 years earlier came back to the beaches that day - many of them from the US.They wanted no talk of the heroism or courage of their youth. We watched them go one by one or in little groups to the cemeteries to find the graves of the young men they'd known and whom they'd left behind in the soil of liberated France.We watched the allied heads of government pay tribute to those old men. But I found myself thinking not so much of the battles they'd fought and the bravery and sacrifices of their younger selves, but of the peace that they'd gone home to build when the fighting was over.The world they bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents. For they were born into a world of Great Power rivalries, in which, in Mark Carney's words, \"the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must\".This was the generation that went home to build the rules-based international order, because they had learned the hard way what a system without rules, without laws, can lead to. They wanted no going back to that.ShutterstockThe world the veterans bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents, writes Allan LittleThose born in the decades after the war may have made the mistake of believing that the world could never go back to that.And 24 years ago, as I gave my talk in a New York City still traumatised by 9/11, did I, too, make the mistake of thinking the post-World War Two order, underpinned, as it was, by American might, was the new permanent normal? I think I did.For we did not foresee then a world in which trust in traditional sources of news and information would be corroded by a rising cynicism, turbo-charged by social media and, increasingly now, artificial intelligence.In any age of economic stagnation and extremes of inequality, popular trust in democratic institutions corrodes. It has been corroding not just in the US but across the Western world for decades now. As such Trump may be a symptom, not a cause, of Carney's \"rupture\" with the post-World War Two order.Watching those old men making their way through the Normandy cemeteries was a graphic and poignant reminder that democracy, the rule of law, accountable government are not naturally occurring phenomena.  They are not even, historically speaking, normal. They have to be fought for, built, sustained, defended.And that is the challenge from here facing what Mark Carney called \"the middle powers\".Top picture credit: AFP/ReutersBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "4 hours agoRachel HaganandNikos PapanikolaouReutersThe fire began early on Monday morning at the Violanta biscuit factoryAt least four people have been killed after a fire broke out at a food factory near the central Greek city of Trikala, the country's fire service says. The blaze began early on Monday at a Violanta biscuit factory, where 13 workers were on site, local media reported. Eight managed to escape. One person remains missing, but the city's deputy mayor for civil protection, Giorgos Katavoutas, told the BBC that \"there is no hope of finding any of the missing workers alive, given the force of the explosion and the fire that followed\".An investigation into the cause of the blaze is ongoing but unconfirmed reports have suggested a possible gas leak. Television footage showed extensive damage to the factory, with part of the building destroyed, effectively splitting the structure in two. Thick smoke could also be seen billowing from the fire. Violanta said it was \"deeply saddened\" by the fire.\"Today a serious incident occurred at our factory premises, during the night shift, for a currently unknown reason,\" Violanta said in a statement.\"We are fully cooperating with the relevant authorities and providing all available assistance.\"Health minister Adonis Georgiadis earlier told the Skai news agency that six workers and a firefighter had been taken to hospital, adding that they were \"in good health, mainly suffering from respiratory problems\". The fire service said more than 50 firefighters and 16 fire trucks had been sent to tackle the blaze.Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis referred to the fire during opening remarks at a cabinet meeting on Monday. \"Our thoughts are with the families of the victims,\" he said, adding that the fire service was already investigating the circumstances of the incident\" so that \"responsibilities can be established\".",

    "body": "Australian authorities have issued heatwave warnings for most of the country as millions mark the national holiday, Australia Day.Temperatures are expected to peak on Tuesday, reaching the \"high forties\" Celsius in the southern states of Victoria and South Australia, the Bureau of Meteorology said.On Sunday, South Australia recorded temperatures as high as 48.5C, the bureau reported. Fire danger warnings are in place across the country.Some Australia Day events on Monday were cancelled out of safety concerns.In Adelaide, a parade and light show were cancelled because of the extreme heat forecast.\"While this is deeply disappointing for the community, performers and partners, community safety and wellbeing must come first,\" organisers said.Australia Day - 26 January - is the anniversary of the 1788 landing of Britain's First Fleet, which began the era of colonisation.But to many people, especially Indigenous Australians, the occasion is a reminder of their cultural destruction under European settlers - referring to the occasion as \"Invasion Day\". Across the country on Monday, huge crowds gathered for rallies in support of Indigenous Australians.Aside from Victoria and South Australia, heatwave warnings have also been issued in New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania, Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory.Many of these warnings will remain in place until Wednesday.\"We haven't seen heatwave conditions like this in Victoria for almost 20 years,\" Tim Wiebusch, Victoria's emergency management commissioner, told ABC.\"It was 2009 ahead of the bushfires where we saw those prevailing conditions and so we are indicating to all Victorians that this is a very serious set of weather conditions.\"On Monday, the Bureau of Meteorology warned of \"extreme fire dangers\" across parts of South Australia and much of south-western Victoria \"due to very hot and dry weather combined with moderate to gusty winds\".Firefighters in Victoria are working to combat several fires across the state, which have prompted evacuations and threatened properties.The heat has also affected the Australian Open at Melbourne Park. Tennis player Jannik Sinner was seen suffering from cramps on the court on Saturday, before play was temporarily suspended in the rising heat. Nearly 80,000 fans were warned to take care under the scorching sun. Meanwhile, parts of Western Australia were pummelled by Tropical Cyclone Luana over the weekend. The storm damaged homes and a popular beach resort before weakening as it moved inland. The meteorological bureau has advised people to find places to keep cool, like their homes, libraries, community centres or shopping centres. It also told people to close their windows and draw the curtains to keep heat out of their homes.",

    "body": "At least 11 people were killed and another dozen injured when gunmen opened fire on locals who had gathered at a football pitch in the city of Salamanca in central Mexico on Sunday.Witnesses said armed men arrived at the grounds in several vehicles and shot at those gathered there seemingly indiscriminately.Many families had stayed behind to socialise after a match between local clubs. At least one woman and one child were among those killed.The motive behind the shooting is not yet clear. Guanajuato, the state in which Salamanca is located, registered the highest number of murders in the whole of Mexico last year.Neighbours reported hearing at least 100 shots ring out as the gunmen opened fire at the Cabañas pitch in the Loma de Flores neighbourhood.Local and federal security forces are now investigating the deadly shooting.It came just a day after several violent incidents in the city, in which a total of five men were killed and another was abducted. Guanajuato has seen a spike in violence committed by a number of gangs that engage in the theft of oil and fuel, as well as other criminal activities such as drug trafficking and extortion. Gang members frequently hold up tanker trucks carrying oil and tap oil pipelines belonging to state-run oil company Pemex.Salamanca, which is home to a major Pemex refinery, has been particularly subject to violent gang-related attacks.Analysts say that the rivalry between the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and the Cartel de Santa Rosa de Lima (CSRL) is behind many of the most brutal incidents.Their criminal activities are not confined to Mexico, with both the smuggling of stolen fuel and illicit drugs spreading violence into the United States.Last year, the US State Department designated the CJNG as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation and, more recently, placed sanctions on the CSRL.US President Donald Trump has made the fight against criminal gangs sending illicit drugs such as heroin, fentanyl, methamphetamines and cocaine one of his priorities. He has in the past alleged that \"cartels are running Mexico\" and has threatened to hit \"narco-terrorists\" with land strikes.The US has already carried out at least 36 strikes against vessels allegedly transporting drugs by sea, both in the Caribbean and the Pacific, killing at least 125 people.Legal experts and Trump's critics have questioned the legality of these strikes. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum last week handed over 37 \"high-impact\" suspects to the US in what local media described as an attempt by her government to co-operate with US counternarcotic efforts and thereby ward off the possibility of Trump ordering unilateral strikes against the cartels in Mexican territory.",

Pilots had reportedly been struggling with visibility at the airport before the crash.Bangor remains under a winter storm warning until Tuesday, with heavy snowfall forecast.Bangor International Airport said following the incident that it had closed and that emergency crews were responding, urging members of the public to avoid the area.Audio from air traffic control, reported by the BBC's US partner CBS News and published by LiveATC.net, captured discussions between controllers and pilots minutes before the crash concerning poor visibility, though it is unclear which aircraft were heard in the communications.Shortly afterwards, a controller was heard saying there was \"a passenger aircraft upside down\". Images from the scene showed smoke and flames on the runway.The disruption came amid widespread travel chaos due to the storm, with more than 11,000 flights cancelled and nearly 5,500 delayed across the US on Sunday, according to tracker FlightAware. Airports in Philadelphia, Washington DC, Baltimore, North Carolina, New York and New Jersey were among those affected.Between 10 and 16 inches (25-40cm) of snow is forecast to accumulate in parts of Maine, including Bangor, by Tuesday morning, according to the National Weather Service.",

The Philippines -  an archipelago nation of 7,100 islands - has a long history of maritime disasters involving inter-island ferries.\"Based on the account of some survivors, the waters in the area were rough at the time,\" Philippine Coast Guard spokeswoman Noemie Cayabyab said in a televised interview, according to an AFP report. A video shared by the disaster management office in the southwestern Bongao Municipality show people wearing life vests floating in the water as they wait for rescuers.Another Facebook video posted by Basilan Governor Mujiv Hataman showed survivors wrapped in blankets as they disembarked from a rescue boat.Rescuers have been overwhelmed by the influx of survivors, Basilan emergency responder Ronalyn Perez told AFP. \"The challenge really is the number of patients that are coming in. We are short-staffed at the moment,\" Perez said.Another rescuer said their office had received more than 100 calls from family members, AFP reported.Poor maintenance and overloading have been blamed for past ferry accidents in the Philippines. Despite this, many Filipinos still travel by ferry due to its low costs. In May 2023, 28 people died after a passenger ferry caught fire. The fatalities included three children, among them a six-month-old baby.The year before that, at least seven people died after a fire in a high-speed ferry carrying 134 people.",

    "body": "Rina Gonoi, the former soldier who was sexually assaulted while serving in Japan's Self-Defense Forces (SDF), has reached a settlement with two remaining defendants - the state and an ex-colleague.Her attorney said on Monday that Gonoi will receive 1.6 million yen ($10,400; £7,600) from the Japanese government, but no compensation or apology from the former colleague.It marks the end of Gonoi's civil lawsuit against five ex-soldiers and the government in a case that has drawn international attention. She reached settlements with four of the five earlier.A 2023 ruling in a separate criminal case found three of the ex-soldiers guilty of sexual assault.Gonoi's case was a landmark one in Japan, where it is rare for victims of sexual violence to speak out. She put her story on YouTube in 2022.But public discussions about sexual violence have increased in recent years, following high-profile cases like journalist Shiori Ito's court battle against her alleged rapist and the expose of J-pop giant Johnny Kitagawa.Gonoi said at a press conference on Monday that she experienced a \"very long and heavy time\" since speaking out more than four years ago.\"During these 4.5 years I came to understand first-hand just how heavy the weight of speaking up is,\" she said.\"Even so, I did not regret speaking out,\" she added.Earlier this month, the 26-year-old wrote on X that her years-long legal battle had \"come to an end\" and thanked everyone who had supported her during the journey.Gonoi had sought 5.5 million yen ($40,000; £32,000) in damages from the men for causing her mental distress, and an additional 2 million yen from the state for its failure to prevent abuse.Warning: This article contains graphic descriptions of sexual assaultIn 2022, Gonoi posted a video on YouTube that garnered attention both in Japan and abroad.She alleged that in 2021, three of her male colleagues had pinned her down and pressed their crotches against her. She said her complaints to her superiors were dismissed.As Gonoi's story went viral, more than 100,000 people signed a petition calling for the defence ministry to investigate her allegations of sexual violence during her time in service.The case also prompted a sweeping investigation into the ranks of the SDF, where defence ministry officials uncovered more than 1,000 other reports of sexual harassment.Her three attackers were convicted of sexual assault and handed two-year prison sentences in 2023. But the sentences were suspended for four years, which means they did not actually have to serve time in prison.",

    "body": "Tearful goodbyes as Japan returns pandas to China amid worsening ties 9 hours agoKelly NgandShaimaa Khalil,Tokyo correspondentEPATwin cubs Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei will return to China on TuesdayThousands of people flocked to a zoo in Japan on Sunday to say farewell to the country's last two giant pandas, who are set to return to China on Tuesday.Emotions ran high at the Ueno zoo in Tokyo as people stood in line – some for as long as three-and-a-half hours – to see twin cubs Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei one last time.This comes at a very tense moment in relations between Tokyo and Beijing. Ties have sharply deteriorated after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said Tokyo would get involved militarily if China attacked Taiwan.The twins' departure will leave Japan without any pandas for the first time since 1972, the year the two countries normalised diplomatic ties.The People's Republic of China has used giant pandas as a gesture of goodwill towards its international allies and competitors since it was founded in 1949.But China retains ownership of all pandas it loans to foreign countries, including cubs born abroad. In return, host countries pay an annual fee of about $1m (£790,000) per pair of pandas.According to Tokyo's metropolitan government, some 108,000 people vied to get one of the 4,400 slots available for one last look at the zoo's beloved pandas.\"I have been bringing my son here since he was a baby, so I hope it becomes a good memory for him. I'm glad we could come today to remember them,\" Ai Shirakawa told the BBC.Ai Shirakawa (left) says she has been bringing her son to see the pandas since he was bornAnother woman recalled witnessing the pandas' growth journey. \"Witnessing their growth, especially since they were so small, has been such a joy,\" she said.Some visitors were pictured sobbing as they bade the bears goodbye.Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei were born in 2021 at the Ueno zoo to their mother Shin Shin and their father Ri Ri, both of whom were on loan to Japan for breeding research.More recently, China's panda loans have coincided with major trade agreements. In 2011, the loan of two pandas to Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland was agreed during negotiations over contracts to supply salmon meat, Land Rover vehicles and energy technology to China.Many pandas have been returned to China in recent years – a loan agreement typically lasts 10 years although extensions are common. However, the prospects of a new panda loan to Japan have remained uncertain amid the escalating row.Japanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi's comments on Taiwan angered Beijing which views the self-governed island as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to \"reunite\" with it.Both sides have since engaged in increasingly hostile actions and rhetoric towards each other. Early this month, China tightened restrictions on exports of rare earth-related products to Japan.Getty ImagesSome 108,000 people vied to get one of the 4,400 slots to see the pandas",

    "body": "58 minutes agoLaura CressTechnology reporterThe European Commission has launched an investigation into Elon Musk's X over concerns its AI tool Grok was used to create sexualised images of real people.It follows a similar announcement in January from the UK watchdog Ofcom.Regina Doherty, a member of the European parliament representing Ireland, said the Commission would assess whether \"manipulated sexually explicit images\" have been shown to users in the EU.A previous statement from X's Safety account said the social media platform had stopped Grok from digitally altering pictures of people to remove their clothing in \"jurisdictions where such content is illegal\".But campaigners and victims said the ability to generate sexually explicit pictures using the tool should have \"never happened\" in the first place, and Ofcom said its investigation would remain ongoing.The EU regulator said it may \"impose interim measures\" if X refuses to implement meaningful adjustments. It said it had also extended its ongoing investigation launched in December 2023 over risks associated with X's recommender systems - the algorithm that recommends specific posts to users.Before the Commission's announcement, Elon Musk posted a picture on X on Monday appearing to make light of the new restrictions in place around Grok. The X owner has previously criticised those scrutinising the app's image-editing function - particularly the UK government - calling it \"any excuse for censorship\".On Sunday, the Grok account on X claimed more than 5.5 billion images were generated by the tool in just 30 days.In a statement to Reuters, Doherty said there were \"serious questions\" over if platforms such as X were meeting legal obligations \"to assess risks properly and to prevent illegal and harmful content from spreading\".\"The European Union has clear rules to protect people online,\" she said.\"Those rules must mean something in practice, especially when powerful technologies are deployed at scale.\"No company operating in the EU is above the law.\"A spokesperson from Coimisiún na Meán, Ireland's media regulator, said it welcomed the news.\"There is no place in our society for non-consensual intimate imagery abuse or child sexual abuse material,\" they said.The move comes a month after the EU fined X €120m (£105m) over its blue tick badges, saying they \"deceive users\" because the firm is not \"meaningfully verifying\" who is behind the account.In response, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accused the EU regulator of attacking and censoring US firms.\"The European Commission's fine isn't just an attack on X, it's an attack on all American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments,\" he said.His remarks were reposted by Musk, who added \"absolutely\".",

    "body": "2 days agoVitaliy ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC MonitoringUkraine is now living through its most difficult winter in recent memory. With January temperatures plummeting below -15C, Russia has been attacking energy infrastructure, leaving about a million Ukrainians without heating.The capital, Kyiv, is the main target of such attacks. Following the latest Russian bombardment overnight into 24 January, almost 6,000 apartment blocks were left without heating, according to mayor Vitaly Klitschko.This is the third such Russian attack targeting Kyiv's heating infrastructure in little more than two weeks, after strikes on 9 and 20 January also left hundreds of thousands freezing in their flats.\"Living in Kyiv is a bit of a gamble these days,\" one resident of the Ukrainian capital, Rita, told the BBC. \"If you have heating and gas, there is no electricity and water. If you have electricity and water, there is no heating. \"Coming home is like playing a guessing game every day - will I be able to shower or have hot tea, or neither? And of course missiles and drones come on top of all that.\" She says she has to go to bed wearing a hat and several layers of clothing.What is making things much worse for Ukraine and easier for Russia is the widespread prevalence of apartment blocks that rely on communal central heating - where water is heated up elsewhere and then pumped into their radiators.Heating plants in Ukraine are huge and many thousands of people are affected when they are targeted by Russian forces. Ukraine says that all such power plants have now been hit.Such attacks also disrupt electricity supplies, but while a generator or battery pack might help in this situation, heating is less straightforward - especially when there is also no electricity to power your heater.Kyivteploenergo, the monopoly supplying heating and hot water in the Ukrainian capital, told the BBC \"the absolute majority\" of houses in Kyiv rely on its services. It said it could not share the exact number for security reasons.In Zaporizhzhia, a frontline city home to 750,000 people, almost three-quarters of residents rely on central heating, according to Maksym Rohalsky, the head of the local association of apartment block dwellers.Before Russia's full-scale invasion of 2022, about 11 million households in Ukraine relied on central heating, compared to seven million autonomously heated households, Ukrainian energy expert Yuriy Korolchuk said. Cities across the Soviet Union, including in Ukraine, were the focus of huge construction programmes launched in the 1950s to mass produce cheap housing.The landscapes of cities in the former USSR are dominated by ubiquitous nine-storey residential buildings made from pre-fabricated concrete panels, known as \"panelki\", or smaller five-storey blocks of flats known as \"khrushchevki\", after Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, who oversaw their construction in the 1950s and 1960s.Heating to such houses is supplied by large plants known as TETs - an acronym that stands for \"heat and electricity centrals\" in Ukrainian as they generate electricity as well as heat.Detached houses occupied by a single family, known as \"private houses\" in Ukraine, are normally found in rural areas and are rare in cities.\"Ukraine inherited the Soviet heating system and it hasn't changed anything, it stays predominantly centralised,\" Korolchuk told the BBC. \"These heating plants were not designed to be attacked with missiles or drones, that's why these vulnerabilities came to the fore during the war.\"According to him, this is a new tactic used by Russia.\"During the previous winters, there were no such strikes against the heating system. They happened only occasionally, and they didn't directly target heating plants,\" he added.Referring to ongoing talks to end the war, he says \"the factor of negotiations is now possibly playing a role, it's a form of pressure\".Large centralised installations bring about efficiencies of scale, but should they be targeted by bombs or drones, the consequences can be devastating for hundreds of thousands of people.The Ukrainian government is acutely aware of this vulnerability, and is planning to reduce it by making individual heating points mandatory at apartment blocks.However, undoing decades of Soviet urban planning will not be quick or easy.",

    "description": "Israel says it has agreed to reopen the Gaza Strip's key border crossing with Egypt only after an operation to retrieve the body of the last remaining",
    "body": "Israel says it has agreed to reopen the Gaza Strip's key border crossing with Egypt only after an operation to retrieve the body of the last remaining Israeli hostage in the territory is complete.The Rafah crossing has been mostly closed since May 2024, when the Palestinian side was seized by Israeli forces. It was meant to have reopened during the first stage of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which began in October.However, the Israeli government has made that conditional on Hamas making every effort to return the body of the last hostage, police officer Master Sgt Ran Gvili.On Sunday, Israel's military said it had begun a new search for his remains in northern Gaza.Although in its latest announcement Israel appears to offer a timeframe for the reopening of the crossing, it is not known how long the search for Gvili will take.Israeli media quoted military officials as saying the operation was taking place at a cemetery in Gaza City and that it could last several days.On Thursday, the head of the new technocratic Palestinian government in Gaza said the Rafah crossing would open \"in both directions\" this week.It comes as US and other mediators continue to press both sides to take the next steps to advance President Donald Trump's peace plan.On Sunday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced that Israel had \"agreed to a limited reopening of the Rafah crossing for pedestrian passage only, subject to a full Israeli inspection mechanism\".The Israeli military was \"currently conducting a focused operation to exhaust all of the intelligence that has been gathered in the effort to locate and return\" the remains of Ran Gvili, a statement said.\"Upon completion of this operation, and in accordance with what has been agreed upon with the US, Israel will open the Rafah crossing,\" it added.Israel's Haaretz newspaper cited a source as saying there would be a \"full Israeli monitoring mechanism\" at the crossing, which would include oversight of entry and exit lists. Israel also planned to establish an additional screening point for all people entering Gaza located in an area around the Yellow Line, which demarcates the territory still controlled by Israeli forces under the ceasefire deal, the source added.Earlier on Sunday, the Israeli military said troops had \"begun a targeted operation in the area of the Yellow Line in the northern Gaza Strip\" to retrieve Gvili's body.Israeli military officials told local media that the operation was acting on intelligence collected over a long period of time, which indicated that Gvili's remains might have been buried in the Shejaiya and Daraj Tuffah areas of Gaza City, east of the Yellow Line.Specialised units were on the ground, including rabbis, search teams and dental experts equipped with mobile X-ray machines, they added.Hamas's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said on Sunday that it had \"provided mediators with all the details and information in our possession regarding the location\" of Gvili's body. Israeli forces were \"searching one of the sites,\" it added.Gvili's family meanwhile reiterated their strong opposition to the reopening of the Rafah crossing before his body had been returned to Israel for burial. \"First and foremost, Ran must be brought home,\" they said.The 24-year-old was killed in Kibbutz Alumim during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023 and his body was taken back to Gaza as a hostage.At the start of December, the Israeli government said the Rafah crossing would open \"in the coming days\" to allow Palestinians to leave Gaza.However, a dispute emerged with Egypt, which said the crossing would only be opened if movement was allowed in both directions, enabling the return of tens of thousands of Palestinians who fled Gaza during the war.On Saturday, US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner led a delegation which met Israel's prime minister for discussions focused on the implementation of phase two of the Gaza peace plan. Witkoff said the meeting was \"constructive and positive\".Under phase one, Hamas and Israel agreed to the ceasefire, an exchange of all living and dead Israeli hostages in Gaza for Palestinians detained in Israeli jails, a partial Israeli withdrawal, and a surge in deliveries of humanitarian aid.Phase two should see a new technocratic Palestinian government in Gaza take over running public services, as well as the reconstruction and full demilitarisation of the territory, including disarmament of Hamas and other groups.The war was triggered by the 7 October 2023 attack, when about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken to Gaza as hostages.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,650 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "14 hours agoEPACrowds gathered in Minneapolis despite the freezing temperaturesThe National Rifle Association (NRA) has joined other US gun lobby groups in calling for a \"full investigation\" by the Trump administration into the killing of Alex Pretti in Minnesota.Comments from the NRA come after a border agent fatally shot Pretti - registered nurse at a Veterans Affairs hospital - in Minneapolis on Saturday.State and federal officials have given starkly different accounts. The Trump administration has said Pretti carried a gun and posed a danger to officers - while no available video shows Pretti holding a gun.The NRA labelled a suggestion by a federal prosecutor that people who carry guns risk being lawfully shot by officers as \"dangerous and wrong\".\"Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalisations and demonising law-abiding citizens,\" the NRA said in a statement.The NRA - which is typically aligned with Donald Trump - was reacting to comments from First Assistant US Attorney for the Central District of California on Saturday night.Bill Essayli wrote on social media: \"If you approach law enforcement with a gun, there is a high likelihood they will be legally justified in shooting you. Don't do it!\"In a separate social-media post, the NRA said: \"As there is with any officer-involved shooting, there will be a robust and comprehensive investigation that takes place to determine if the use of force was justified. \"As we await these facts and gain a clearer understanding, we urge the political voices to lower the temperature to ensure their constituents and law enforcement officers stay safe.\"What we know about fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents in MinneapolisProtests and anger after man shot dead by immigration agents in MinneapolisWhat is ICE and what powers do its agents have to use force?Essayli's comments have drawn criticism from other gun advocacy groups, as well as politicians from across the spectrum.Gun Owners of America said in a statement: \"The Second Amendment protects Americans' right to bear arms while protesting - a right the federal government must not infringe upon.\"Republican Thomas Massie said: \"Carrying a firearm is not a death sentence, it's a constitutionally protected God-given right, and if you don't understand this you have no business in law enforcement or government.\"In a follow-up social media post, Essayli accused critics of taking his comments out of context.\"I never said it's legally justified to shoot law-abiding concealed carriers,\" he said on X. \"My comment addressed agitators approaching law enforcement with a gun and refusing to disarm.\"For the second time this month, federal agents have been involved in a fatal shooting in Minneapolis linked to a crackdown on illegal immigration by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.Bystander video footage has captured the moments before Pretti was shot on Saturday.The altercation that led to Pretti's shooting was recorded from many points of view and federal and state officials have given conflicting accounts.Watch: Video shows moments around fatal shooting in MinneapolisThe Department for Homeland Security shared an image of a gun it claimed belonged to Pretti and said he was a threat to officers. On Saturday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was asked to clarify if Pretti had brandished a gun and said agents fired what she called \"defensive shots\" while trying to disarm Pretti.\"They responded according to their training, and took action to defend the officer's life and those of the public around him. And, I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammunition rather than a sign.\"Minnesota Governor Tim Walz branded the Trump administration's version of events \"nonsense\" and \"lies.\"Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey likened the federal operation to an invasion and accused ICE of \"trying to spin this as an action of self-defence\".",

    "body": "Uganda's military chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba has denied claims that soldiers assaulted Barbara Kyagulanyi, the wife of opposition leader Bobi Wine, during a raid at their home.Wine, who is in hiding, alleged on Saturday that his wife was held at gunpoint by military officers who assaulted her, taking away documents and electronic items. He said the house continued to be surrounded by the military.Speaking from hospital, Barbara Kyagulanyi said the officers had demanded to know Wine's whereabouts and had assaulted her when she refused.It comes after the recent landslide victory of long-serving leader, and Kainerugaba's father, President Yoweri Museveni. Wine rejected the results citing fraud.On Monday, the general posted on X that \"my soldiers did not beat up Barbie [Bobi Wine's] wife\".\"First of all, we do not beat up women. They are not worth our time. We are looking for her cowardly husband not her,\" he said.Since Museveni was announced the winner of the 15 January election, the military chief has demanded Wine's surrender and has issued death threats against him.Wine said on Monday that Kainerugaba was still looking for him \"and issuing threats to harm me\" and thanked the people for continuing to keep him safe.\"My wife is still recovering from the trauma of an overnight raid and assault... My home is still surrounded by the military,\" he added in a post on X.From her hospital bed, Barbara Kyagulanyi had described how dozens of men had broken into her house, some in military uniform, harassing and assaulting her.She said one of the men \"hit me on the face and tore my lip\". She said the officer had lifted her from behind by the waistband of her trousers while another choked her as she hung mid-air. She said the first officer pulled off her blouse, leaving her partially naked, though it was later given back.She said the officer also pulled her hair and \"hit me on the face and tore my lip\".Barbara Kyagulanyi said she passed out after the ordeal. According to Wine, she was taken to hospital \"with both physical and psychological trauma\".Since the election, the opposition has alleged that its supporters have been targeted by the security forces.Kainerugaba said on Friday that security officers had killed 30 supporters of the opposition National Unity Party (NUP) led by Wine and detained 2,000 others.Lawmaker Muwanga Kivumbi, who is a close Wine ally, was arrested for his alleged role in election-related violence last week, which the party denied.The Uganda Law Society denounced the \"ongoing wave of detentions, torture and enforced disappearance\" of opposition leaders and supporters\".\"No-one should be subjected to violence by security forces under the pretext of national security,\" the society said on Sunday.Uganda has not witnessed a peaceful transfer of presidential power since independence. Museveni first came to office as a rebel leader in 1986 and will have served for 45 years when the next term ends in 2031.",

    "body": "1 hour agoAlfred Lasteck,BBC AfricaandLucy FlemingAFP/Getty ImagesRigathi Gachagu is a wealthy businessman popular in his home region of Mount KenyaProminent Kenyan opposition figure Rigathi Gachagua has alleged there was an attempt on his life during a Sunday church service.Gachagua, who was sacked as deputy president in an impeachment trial in 2024, claimed in an interview with the BBC that rogue police officers \"shot at everybody and tear-gassed the church\" in Othaya in the central county of Nyeri.He had previously accused his former ally President William Ruto of ordering the attack but not provide any evidence. Ruto has not commented but Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen condemned the violence, calling it unacceptable.The police said an investigation had been launched, adding that no injuries had been reported.Reports to the police indicated that a tear-gas canister had been thrown inside St Peters Anglican Church at 11:00 local time (08:00 GMT) disrupting the service.Several vehicles were reportedly damaged within the church compound, the police added, appealing for witnesses.Gachagua, a wealthy businessman from the central Mount Kenya area and now a vocal critic of the president, said he was escorted to safety by his security team.He had posted photos of the incident on X and alleged to the BBC's Newsday programme that \"armed police officers with AK47s and tear gas descended on the church\".Gachagua said that after he was helped to safety, the attackers set his car on fire and \"mercilessly\" beat up those gathered outside the church.The Democracy for the Citizens Party leader said he has not reported the incident to the relevant authorities \"because it is the police who attacked us. You cannot report the police to the police\".Earlier, Gachagua held a news conference where he dismissed suggestions from pro-government bloggers that the attack had been stage-managed.\"Where can we get access to tear gas?... Where do we get access to AK-47 assault rifles?\" he asked.@rigathiRigathi Gachagua posted photos on X showing the chaos at the church compoundMurkomen said the police chief had promised him that the attackers would be brought to justice.\"Violence anywhere, and least of all in a place of worship, is unacceptable,\" the interior minister said in a post on X.\"The police must move without fear or favour and deal decisively with the sponsors and perpetrators of this act without regard to their status in society or political affiliation.\"According to Kenya's constitution, Gachagua's conviction by the senate means he cannot hold public office again. He had pleaded not guilty to 11 charges of which he was found guilty of five, including inciting ethnic divisions and violating his oath of office.However the politician, popularly known as Riggy G, maintains he will be on the presidential ballot next year as he is appealing and the Supreme Court has not ruled on his impeachment.Ruto and Gachagua were elected on a joint ticket in 2022 - and the partnership helped Ruto win by marshalling support in Mount Kenya, the heartland of the Kikuyu people who are the largest voting bloc in Kenya.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

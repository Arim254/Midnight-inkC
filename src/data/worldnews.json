    "body": "Trump and the NFL - why it's complicatedImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell joined Donald Trump in the Oval Office in MayByBen CollinsBBC Sport journalist in San FranciscoUpdated 6 February 2026 09:37 GMTAmerican football fans never thought they would see the day - the head of the National Football League standing shoulder to shoulder with Donald Trump in the Oval Office.Trump has frequently traded blows with the NFL since he first became US president in 2017, but he and America's most popular sports league have been sparring partners for more than 40 years.Trump's 'feud' with the NFL has involved him testifying against the league and failing, on multiple occasions, to buy a team. It may even have propelled him to the presidency.When NFL commissioner Roger Goodell joined Trump in May to announce the NFL Draft would be coming to Washington DC for the first time, it seemed Trump had finally made friends with arguably his oldest foe.Well, maybe not. With this season set to conclude with Super Bowl 60 on Sunday, BBC Sport examines Trump's long and complicated relationship with the NFL and why it could be set for another twist.Lawsuit fails to force league mergerImage source, APImage caption, Herschel Walker racked up a record 2,411 rushing yards for the Generals in 1985 and is now the US ambassador to the Bahamas after being nominated by TrumpAlready a real-estate magnate by that point, Trump viewed owning an American football team as a means of building his brand. After attempting to acquire an NFL franchise, a 37-year-old Trump bought the New Jersey Generals in September 1983.They were founding members of the USFL, which started in the spring of 1983 so did not clash with the NFL. The new league managed to lure top players from the NFL and the college game.The Generals improved during their two seasons under Trump but lost in the first round of the play-offs in both 1984 and 1985.However, Trump had made his intentions clear from the outset. He didn't want the USFL to remain a spring league; he wanted to go directly against the NFL in autumn-winter.That was not the USFL's original plan but, in August 1984, Trump convinced team owners to vote on switching to an autumn-winter schedule from 1986.Then, two months, later the USFL filed an anti-trust lawsuit against the NFL - led by Trump. The case went to trial in May 1986, with the USFL arguing the NFL had conspired to monopolise TV contracts, seeking damages worth $1.7bn (£1.25bn).Trump hoped it would force a league merger and earn him an NFL franchise. He also envisaged a Trump-branded stadium in Manhattan.The trial lasted 42 days and a jury found the NFL was an 'illegal monopoly'. But it rejected the other charges and the USFL was awarded just $3 as the jury felt most of the USFL's problems were self-inflicted.The league had built up huge debt and, days after the verdict, it folded.In a book about the USFL,, external one of the jurors said Trump \"came off as arrogant and unlikeable\" in court.Trump and then NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle provided contrasting accounts of a meeting they had in March 1984, during which Rozelle is alleged to have told Trump, external \"as long as I or any of my heirs are involved in the NFL, you will never be a franchise owner in the league\".Did failed Bills bid lead to presidential run?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Trump's lawyer Christopher Kise (right) argued his bid to buy the Buffalo Bills was not relevant to his fraud trial as the deal was not completedTrump had already attempted to buy the Baltimore Colts, before the NFL franchise relocated to Indianapolis in 1984.He then turned down the chance to buy the Dallas Cowboys for $50m in 1984 and bought the Generals instead for $9m. \"I feel sorry for the poor guy who is going to buy the Dallas Cowboys,\" he told the New York Times.Jerry Jones became the Cowboys' owner in 1989. 'America's Team' won three Super Bowls in the '90s and are now the world's most valuable sports team at $10.1bn (£7.5bn)., externalAfter the USFL's demise, Trump pulled out of discussions in 1988 to buy the New England Patriots, who have won six Super Bowls under current owner Robert Kraft.Trump focused on other enterprises, becoming a reality TV star on The Apprentice, until the Buffalo Bills were put up for sale in 2014.Trump claims he bid $1bn in cash but Terry Pegula, who already owned the NHL's Buffalo Sabres, ultimately bought the Bills for $1.4bn.That bidding process was mentioned during the fraud trial that ruled against Trump - who had denied all accusations - in 2024, before his $500m (£372m) penalty was overturned last week. His former lawyer Michael Cohen used it as an example of how he would inflate Trump's assets, in that case claiming a net worth of $8bn in a bid to secure a loan to buy the Bills.Documents also showed Trump declined to provide financial statements to the Bills' bankers - one of whom testified that, instead, Trump \"gave us handouts of the Forbes list of the top-paid entertainers\".ESPN analyst Stephen A. Smith has repeatedly claimed that before Pegula's takeover was approved by NFL team owners in October 2014, he received a call from Trump in which he said: \"If they screw me over, I am going to show them. I'm going to get them all back. I'm going to run for president.\"Eight months later, Trump announced he was doing just that. He later said: \"If I bought that team, I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing.''Media caption, Trump attacked dissenting NFL players at a rally in AlabamaIt was during Trump's first presidential run that NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick began taking the knee during America's national anthem, to protest against racial injustice and police brutality in the US.Many NFL players followed suit and Trump was a vocal critic, before and after he was elected in November 2016.During a rally in September 2017, Trump urged fans to boycott games and NFL team owners to sack any players who did not stand for the anthem. He also called for the league to change its rules, regarding both the protests and the game itself.The following day NFL commissioner Goodell issued a statement, in which he said: \"Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL.\"Patriots owner Kraft told BBC Sport that Trump's comments on the anthem protests were \"inflammatory and inappropriate\". In a meeting between players and owners in October 2017,, external Kraft added: \"We have a president who will use that as fodder to do his mission, that I don't feel is in the best interests of America\".After a team owners' meeting in the same month, the Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shahid Khan told USA Today, external that Trump was \"trying to soil a league or a brand that he's jealous of\".Khan added: \"He's been elected president, where maybe a great goal he had in life to own an NFL team is not very likely, so to make it tougher, or to hurt the league, it's very calculated.\"Trump said he \"would love\" to see Kaepernick return to the NFL as it continued to struggle with the anthem issue.In May 2018, the NFL introduced a new policy giving players the option to stand or stay in the locker room but, in the wake of George Floyd's death, Goodell admitted the NFL was wrong and encouraged players to peacefully protest.Smith has said Trump \"hijacked the narrative\" over Kaepernick \"for his own benefit\", while his ESPN colleague Adam Schefter said Trump was \"waging his own little vendetta against the NFL\".Added intrigue around White House visitsImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The Patriots were the first Super Bowl winners after Trump's first inauguration, with owner Robert Kraft (right) among those to visit the White House in April 2017The tradition of championship teams visiting the White House started long before Trump took office, but now there is far greater attention on who is invited and whether they will attend.Half of the Patriots team did not travel in 2017, including quarterback Tom Brady, with five of those players citing political objections to Trump.The following year he revoked an invitation to the Philadelphia Eagles the day before the planned visit, after most of the team said they would not attend.The Patriots were asked to return in 2019, but both parties were unable to schedule a date, while the Covid pandemic ruled out any chance of the Kansas City Chiefs visiting in 2020.Three weeks after Trump's second inauguration in January he watched the Eagles beat the Chiefs, and this time they did visit the White House in April.Less than half the team attended, quarterback Jalen Hurts among those not present, although a White House official said he and the other absentees had \"scheduling conflicts\".Trump has also invited the Chiefs as they \"missed their turn\" in 2020, even though  one of the few remaining players is Travis Kelce, who is engaged to Taylor Swift.Trump said he \"hated\" Swift after she endorsed his rival presidential candidate Kamala Harris in 2024, and celebrated the singer being booed at last year's Super Bowl.But Trump congratulated them on their engagement in August and said Swift is a \"terrific person\" so perhaps Kelce would visit, if the Chiefs can fix a date.Could Trump create more NFL history?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Josh Harris (left) and Goodell (centre) joined Trump in the Oval Office, with Harris presenting him with a ball that read \"in recognition of\" Trump \"bringing the NFL Draft to the nation's capital\" After becoming the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl last February, Trump looked to have achieved a complete turnaround with the NFL when Goodell and the Washington Commanders owner Josh Harris joined him at the White House to announce the US capital would host the 2027 draft.The news came a week after the Commanders reached an agreement to build a $4bn (£3bn) domed stadium in Washington DC, which Goodell acknowledged would \"dramatically\" boost the district's chances of hosting a Super Bowl.The local council approved the deal in August, so Trump could become the first president to bring the nation's biggest sporting event to its capital city.But Trump said he may block those plans if the \"Washington 'Whatevers''\" do not \"change the name back\". The team won three Super Bowls while known by a name which is considered offensive to Native Americans and was dropped in 2020.Some say you should never mix sport with politics, but Trump continues to embrace it more than any of his predecessors.Last July, he reintroduced the presidential fitness test to American schools and announced a sports council including high-profile figures such as Goodell and several NFL players, although Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa \"didn't know too much about it\" and Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley said he had declined his invitation.But the league appears to have irked Trump yet again by choosing Puerto Rican pop star Bad Bunny to perform the Super Bowl half-time show in Santa Clara on Sunday and American band Green Day to play the opening ceremony.Both acts have been critical of Trump and his administration's immigration crackdown. The president responded by saying \"I'm anti-them. I think it's a terrible choice\", but insists the reason he is not attending Sunday's game in Santa Clara, California, is because it is \"just too far away\".While Trump feels that choosing those performers will only \"sow hatred\", commissioner Goodell believes it will \"unite people\". If Bad Bunny uses the huge platform the NFL has given him to make another statement against Trump, it's fair to assume he'll be planing how to strike the league back.This story was first published on 28 August 2025.",

    "body": "21 hours agoJaroslav LukivNurPhoto via Getty ImagesThorbjørn Jagland's lawyer promised his client's full co-operation with the investigationPolice in Norway have opened a corruption investigation into the country's former Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland over his alleged links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. A special Norwegian police unit which is analysing newly released Epstein files in the US said the 75-year-old was suspected of \"aggravated corruption\". Police said they had already asked the country's foreign ministry to lift his immunity, which he enjoys because of his past role as a senior foreign diplomat. Jagland is also a former head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee and spent 10 years as secretary general of the Council of Europe. His lawyer said they would fully co-operate with the investigation.Pål K. Lønseth, head of Økokrim - the economic crime unit investigating Jagland - said: \"We consider there are reasonable grounds for investigation, given that he held the positions of chair of the Nobel Committee and Secretary General of the Council of Europe during the period covered by the released documents.\"Among other things, Økokrim will investigate whether gifts, travel and loans were received in connection with his position.\"The police added that further details would be given \"at a later stage\".Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said it was \"important that the facts of this case are brought to light\".He added that Oslo would ask the Council of Europe for Jagland's immunity to be revoked.Jagland's lawyer Anders Brosveet welcomed the opening of the investigation.\"Based on what we have found so far, we are confident of the outcome,\" he told Reuters news agency. Separately, Brosveet told Norway's VG news site that he and his client would submit \"the key findings and documentation we have to Økokrim as soon as practically possible\".Jagland was Norway's prime minister in 1996-97, and the secretary general of the Council of Europe in 2009-19.He also chaired the Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2009-15.",

    "body": "More than 30 killed in blast at Pakistan mosque, officials say32 minutes agoShahzad Malik and Umer Draz, BBC Urdu, and Flora DruryIslamabad and LondonGetty ImagesAt least 31 people have been killed and 169 injured in an explosion at a mosque during Friday prayers in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, officials say.According to police, a suicide bomber detonated a device after approaching the gates of the Shia mosque in the Tarlai area of the city. Eyewitnesses have told the BBC the blast was preceded by the sound of gunfire.An emergency was declared as hospitals began to receive the wounded, with an appeal sent out for blood donations.Condemning the incident, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed \"deep grief\" as he called for a thorough investigation and the immediate identification of those behind the attack.In separate statements, Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari said \"targeting innocent civilians is a crime against humanity\", while Defence Minister Khawaja Asif suggested India and Afghanistan were behind the attack.Asif said in a social media post that it had been \"proven\" the attacker had travelled to and from Afghanistan, and \"collusion between India and Afghanistan is being revealed\".Afghanistan's Taliban government described Khawaja Asif's comments as \"regrettable\", saying the Pakistani minister \"hastily attempted to attribute the incident to Afghanistan without presenting any credible evidence\".Afghan foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi earlier condemned the attack and extended condolences, calling such attacks a \"contradiction to Islamic and humanitarian values\".The Indian foreign ministry also condemned the attack and sent condolences for the loss of life, calling the accusations it may be involved \"baseless\".Talal Chaudhry, Pakistan's minister of state for interior, said the suspect was not an Afghan citizen, according to local media.A spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he condemned the attack in the \"strongest terms\" and called for those responsible to be \"identified and brought to justice\". 'We bowed - then there was an explosion'EPAEmergency vehicles and private cars transported the injured to hospitalZaheer Abbas was inside the Khadijatul Kubra Mosque praying when he first heard the sound of bullets.\"After that, we bowed and then prostrated, and then there was an explosion,\" he told BBC Urdu. \"After which there were injured people lying everywhere.\"Pictures from the mosque in the aftermath show footwear scattered across the floor, shattered glass, and people sat among the wreckage.AFP via Getty ImagesAlmost 170 were injured in the explosion, with an appeal for blood donors being issuedAbbas, who said he \"lost his senses\" in the moments after the explosion, was eventually pulled out by emergency services and taken to hospital, where he was quickly released.\"Fortunately, I did not suffer much injury,\" he said.According to Pakistan's defence minister, the attacker opened fire and detonated the bomb after being challenged by security guards.The mosque's caretaker Syed Ashfaq - who lives next door - also heard gunfire, and began running towards the mosque to help.\"By the time I reached it there had already been an explosion,\" he told the BBC. \"Bodies were lying everywhere, some were missing arms, some missing legs. We took the most injured in our own vehicle [to hospital].\"Islamabad's deputy commissioner Irfan Memon said on X that the death toll stood at 31, with the injured numbering 169.Pictures from local hospitals show the injured being brought by private vehicles and ambulances, with one photographer for news agency AFP saying they saw dozens of people arriving at hospital.Attacks are relatively rare in the capital, although one in November left 12 dead. Another 27 were injured in the blast, outside a courthouse.The blast on Friday comes after a week of violence which saw 58 civilians killed in coordinated attacks in the province of Balochistan. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) rebel group said it was behind the attacks. The military - which has been fighting an insurgency in the region for decades - said it had killed more than 200 militants in response.Last year was also Pakistan's deadliest in over a decade as combat-related deaths surged 74%, with militants accounting for more than half the death toll, according to a new report released by an independent think tank.The Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) said violence in Pakistan left 3,413 people dead - up from 1,950 in 2024 - with 2,138 militants killed.Additional reporting Caroline Davies",

    "body": "6 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterGetty ImagesThe EU has told TikTok it must change its \"addictive design\" or face heavy fines, after it found the video sharing platform had breached its online safety rules.It follows an investigation which began in February 2024 into the Chinese-owned app by the European Commission.In its preliminary findings, the Commission said TikTok did not \"adequately assess\" how features like autoplay could harm the wellbeing of its users, including children, and said it failed to implement measures to mitigate the risks.A TikTok spokesperson told the BBC the findings presented a \"categorically false and entirely meritless depiction of our platform\" and it planned to challenge them.The platform has been invited to respond to the EU's findings. Depending on the outcome of this step, the Commission could fine TikTok up to 6% of its total global annual turnover - estimated to be in the tens of billions.EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen told reporters if TikTok wanted to avoid being fined, it would have to \"change the design of their service in Europe\".The Commission gave several suggestions for actions the platform could take, including implementing \"screen time breaks\" when people are using it at night and changing its algorithms, which feed users personalised content.It also suggested TikTok disable so-called \"infinite scroll\", which allows people to quickly cycle through millions of videos on the platform.\"The Digital Services Act makes platforms responsible for the effects they can have on their users,\" Virkkunen said.\"In Europe, we enforce our legislation to protect our children and our citizens online.\"Professor Sonia Livingstone at the London School of Economics said while TikTok had introduced some tools to improve the online safety of its users, it was not enough to comply with the guidelines set down by the EU.\"Young people are calling for such changes,\" she said. \"They are frustrated that the platform does not prioritise their wellbeing over profit.\"And social media expert Matt Navarra said while the use of the word addictive was \"often abused\" in these debates, the Commission's findings seemed to be rooted in \"true behavioural science\".He added it marked a \"seismic shift\" in the way in which regulators were looking at social media platforms.\"This seems to be the first time a major regulator has said that the design is the problem,\" he said.\"It's no longer about just toxic content, it's about toxic design.\"'Warning shot'It is not the first time the EU has looked into the workings of big tech firms or threatened them with fines.In December 2024 it began a separate investigation into TikTok over alleged foreign interference during the Romanian presidential elections.It has also launched an inquiry in January into Elon Musk's X over concerns its AI tool Grok was used to create sexualised images of real people.Meanwhile in December 2025 the EU fined X €120m (£105m) over its blue tick badges, saying they \"deceive users\" because the firm is not \"meaningfully verifying\" who is behind the account.Social media analyst Paolo Pescatore said the latest announcement was a \"reality check\" for TikTok - and a \"warning shot\" for every social media platform.\"The market is shifting from 'maximise engagement' to 'engineer responsibility' - and regulators now have the tools to enforce it,\" he said.",

    "body": "Coin portrait of late Queen draws criticism in Australia 9 hours agoKathryn ArmstrongRoyal Australian Mint$5 and 50 cent versions of the coin have been released to mark the centenary of Queen Elizabeth II's birthTwo commemorative coins, released by the Royal Australian Mint and bearing a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, have been criticised for their lack of resemblance to the late monarch.The $5 (£2.56) and 50 cent silver coins, created to commemorate the centenary of the Queen's birth, were released in an online ballot that closed on Wednesday.\"That's got to be the most unpleasant portrait on a coin,\" said one of several people who reacted negatively online. The Royal Australian Mint defended the portrait, saying: \"Our coin images don't always capture the full beauty of a design once it's etched in metal.\"Queen Elizabeth II died in 2022 at the age of 96 and was the UK's longest serving monarch. \"There's a reason most portraits are from the side. Looks like she just ran into a wall,\" one person commented underneath a Facebook post from the mint.\"If I saw that face without the hairdo and pearls, would never guess who it was meant to be,\" another said.Comparisons have been made with various TV characters, including Mrs Doubtfire - the beloved fictional housekeeper in the comedy film of the same name, played by the late Robin Williams.Royal Australian MintOther people were more positive about the design, which was created by one of the mint's artists. \"Awesome. I'm glad they put something out to do with Queen Elizabeth II, she deserves to have Recognition In a Special Way,\" one user wrote on social media.\"Please pick me for one of these coins,\" said another. One woman living in the US commented that it \"looks like a beautiful coin\". Despite the criticism, collectors reported that the ballot was fully subscribed. Australian media, quoting a spokesperson for the Royal Australian Mint, said the silver proof coins had sold out, and there were limited stocks left in their contact centre and shop.According to the mint's website, it created 30,000 of the 50c coins and 5,000 of the $5 - all of which are collector's items and will not enter general public circulation.As well as the queen's portrait, the coins feature designs \"symbolically reflecting the many facets of Queen Elizabeth II's life and legacy\", the mint said. These include motifs of a horse and corgi, references to art and theatre to mark \"her enduring support for culture\", as well as some of her favourite flowers - roses and lily of the valley. The golden wattle, Australia's national floral emblem, is also represented. \"The design incorporates Her Majesty's Royal Cypher, a stylised St Edward's Crown and the Auxiliary Territorial Service emblem, acknowledging her wartime service and lifelong sense of duty,\" the mint added.Meanwhile, the backs of the coins feature a portrait of the Queen's son, King Charles, in profile.

    "body": "4 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorWatch: BBC on the scene of Russian general shooting in MoscowA high-profile general in Russia's military has been shot several times and wounded in Moscow.Lt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev, 64, was taken to hospital after the attack in a residential block of flats in the north-western outskirts of the capital, and is believed to be in a serious condition. The attacker fled the scene.Alexeyev is number two in the main directorate of Russia's GRU military intelligence  and the latest high-ranking military figure to have been targeted in or near Moscow since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.No-one has so far claimed the attack, but senior Russian officials immediately blamed Ukraine, saying it was trying to derail negotiations to end the war.\"The victim has been taken to one of the city's hospitals,\" said Svetlana Petrenko of Russia's Investigations Committee (SK), which said it opened a criminal case for attempted murder.Investigators are searching CCTV footage for clues and began interviewing potential witnesses of the attack on Friday morning on Volokolamsk Highway.Russian Defence MinistryLt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev is number two in the main directorate of Russia's GRU military intelligenceA neighbour of Alexeyev told the Reuters news agency she had been woken by the sound of \"several\" shots and had then heard another neighbour screaming for help.  \"This is all I heard. Other neighbours rushed out, too. They asked how they could help, should they call ambulance and police, but she had already called them.\"Alexeyev has played a significant role during the war in Ukraine, taking part in talks with Ukraine during the Russian siege of the city of Mariupol in 2022. Earlier he was awarded the title Hero of Russia for the role he played in Moscow's military intervention in Syria's civil war.He was placed under European Union and UK sanctions after the GRU was accused of being behind the 2018 nerve agent attack in Salisbury in the UK.He was also sent to negotiate with the head of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who led a short and bloody mutiny in June 2023.His boss at the GRU, Igor Kostyukov, has been in charge of Russia's negotiating team at peace talks with Ukrainian and US teams in Abu Dhabi. The latest round ended on Thursday without a major breakthrough.It is not yet known who was behind the shooting - but Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quick to accuse Ukraine.He said \"this terrorist act\" was aimed at \"disrupting the negotiation process\".Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin was being briefed on the shooting. \"We wish first of all that the general survives and recovers. We hope that will be the case,\" Peskov told reporters.Ukraine has not commented but has claimed some attacks on Russian military figures in the past. Russian intelligence officials claimed they had thwarted an attempted attack on a Russian soldier in St Petersburg at the end of last month.An Uzbek man was jailed in January for the 2024 killing of another general, Igor Kirillov, in an explosion outside a block of flats in Moscow. Sources in Ukraine's SBU intelligence said at the time it was behind the attack.Lt Gen Kirillov had been in charge of Russia's Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection troops.In December 2025, another high-ranking officer in the GRU, Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, was killed when an explosive device detonated under a car in Moscow. He was in charge of the armed force's operational training department, according to Russia's SK.",

    "body": "7 hours agoOlivia IrelandWatch: What's happened since Savannah Guthrie's mother disappeared?The brother of US news presenter Savannah Guthrie has renewed his family's plea for proof that their mother is still alive after she disappeared last weekend.As the first deadline from an alleged ransom letter passed, Camron Guthrie said in a video posted to Instagram that the family had not heard anything about their missing mother, Nancy Guthrie.The 84-year-old is believed to have been abducted from her home in Tucson, Arizona in the middle of the night. Police launched a massive hunt, with officials offering a reward of $50,000 (£36,000) for information that leads to an arrest.\"We have to know that you have our mum,\" Camron said in the latest video message. \"We want to talk to you.\"\"We haven't heard anything directly,\" he said in the video, posted on Thursday just after 17:00 local time in Arizona (00:00 GMT).\"We need you to reach out, and we need a way to communicate with you so we can move forward.\"It came as the first supposed deadline for the Guthrie family to hand over money passed. At a briefing on Thursday, FBI Special Agent Heith Janke said his agency was reviewing an alleged ransom note. It gave a deadline for payment of 17:00 on Thursday, he said, without specifying which time zone, and had a second deadline for Monday.No further information was shared about what was threatened if the deadline was not met. \"We're not going to go into specifics,\" Janke said.It was announced the same day that authorities had made an arrest over a fake ransom note. Earlier in the week, Savannah Guthrie shared an emotional video message, along with her siblings. The host of NBC News' Today programme addressed the potential abductor or abductors directly, saying: \"We are ready to talk... We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and you have her... Please, reach out to us\".The case has garnered nationwide attention, with dozens of reporters and camera crews descending on the quiet Arizona suburb where Nancy lives.Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said on Thursday investigators were no closer to finding out who was responsible - but that they were working on the assumption she was still alive.\"Right now, we believe Nancy is still out there. We want her home,\" he said. \"Everybody's still a suspect in our eyes.\" Authorities have urged the public to call the sheriff's office with any information, vowing to look into all leads, and discouraging the spread of misinformation.",

    "body": "5 hours agoJean OtalorCentre for memoriesA statue commemorating the killing of the coal miners was erected in the centre of EnuguA Nigerian court has ordered the British government to pay $27m (£20m) to each of the families of 21 coal miners killed in 1949 by the colonial administration in the south-east of the country.The colonial police, made up of Nigerians and Europeans, shot dead workers striking for better conditions. Dozens more were injured in what the state-run News Agency of Nigeria described as one of the most notorious acts of repression under British rule in Nigeria.Historians say the killing helped galvanise support for the burgeoning anti-colonial movement that led to independence 11 years later, in 1960.The UK government said it had not been formally notified of the judgement and so could not comment.The UK had not been represented in the proceedings, a spokesperson told the BBC.Families and rights groups have led a decades-long campaign for official acknowledgment and compensation.The ruling, delivered by Justice Anthony Onovo in Enugu, described the massacre as unlawful and extrajudicial violation of the right to life, NAN reports.According to him, the British government must be held accountable and must make reparations to the victims' families.\"These defenceless coal miners were asking for improved work conditions, they were not embarking on any violent action against the authorities, but yet were shot and killed,\" Onovo told the Enugu High Court.The workers at the Iva Valley coal mine were protesting against harsh working conditions, racial disparities in wages and unpaid back wages. When their demands were not met, they adopted a \"go-slow\" protest and occupied the mine to prevent management from locking them out, NAN reports.The suit was brought by human rights activist, Mazi Greg Onoh, who listed the British and Nigerian governments as respondents.\"This ruling represents a significant milestone in the pursuit of historical accountability and justice for colonial-era violations, affirming that the right to life transcends time, borders, and changes in sovereignty,\" said the applicants' lawyer, Prof Yemi Akinseye-George.The killings took place on 18 November 1949 in Enugu, which was the administrative capital of the Eastern Region of British-administered Nigeria at the time.Historian Damola Adebowale told the BBC it was a \"trigger-point\" for the independence movement. \"Calls for independence already exist[ed] and talks [were] ongoing. The massacre was a reference point for people outlining the need for the colonialists to go,\" he said.During an official investigation at the time, the police defended the shootings by saying they feared being overwhelmed.But among those that the inquiry blamed were the colonialists in charge of the police for inflaming the situation. Those killed are now celebrated in the region as heroes.Additional reporting by Chiagozie Nwonwu and Nduka OrjinmoMore about Nigeria from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "17 hours agoKelly NgandShaimaa Khalil,Tokyo correspondentReutersTakaichi has \"already proven to be a strong, powerful, and wise leader,\" Trump says in throwing his weight behind herDonald Trump has endorsed Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi ahead of a snap election in her country on Sunday. Takaichi has \"already proven to be a strong, powerful, and wise leader... one that truly loves her country,\" the US president wrote in a Truth Social post on Thursday, adding: \"She will not let the people of Japan down!\"While it is rare for US presidents to publicly back candidates in foreign elections, Trump has done so before, endorsing Argentina's Javier Milei and Hungary's Viktor Orban most recently.  Takaichi has courted the US president as Tokyo seeks more stability in its relationship with Washington, its closest ally, in the wake of Trump's tariffs. Trump had threatened a 25% tariff initially, but Japan then struck a deal in July  to invest $550bn (£407bn) in the US. In exchange, Washington lowered import levies to 15%. Takaichi, 64, became PM in October after she won the leadership race in her party and secured enough support in parliament. But she has called an election to seek a public mandate. Just one week after she took office, Tokyo rolled out the red carpet for Trump, deploying a full military guard of honour and band to welcome him at the Akasaka Palace, the government's state guesthouse.It was her diplomatic debut, and the optics were striking: Takaichi aboard the aircraft carrier USS George Washington, fists pumping as the US president praised her in front of thousands of US soldiers, the images then broadcast around the world.She sought to portray herself as a leader Trump can and wants to do business with and, perhaps more importantly for the president, someone he gets along with personally.The two leaders also see eye-to-eye on defence. Trump wants Tokyo to spend more on its own security and so does Takaichi, as sentiment grows in Japan that it must invest more in defence. They heaped compliments on each other during the visit and signed a deal on rare earths, as well as a document heralding a new \"golden age\" of US-Japan relations. Takaichi described Trump as a \"partner in a new golden era\", and praised his role in bringing peace to the Middle East. \"In my visit to Japan, I and all of my representatives, were extremely impressed with her,\" Trump wrote in his Truth Social post on Thursday, noting that the two countries have made progress in national security cooperation and on the economic front.Trump also said he would welcome Takaichi to the White House on 19 March. Getty Images'My goal is to become the Iron Lady,' Takaichi saysHis post, which signals that Takaichi is a leader his administration would work with, is a message aimed not only at Japanese voters but also the region, and especially China. Beijing and Tokyo are in the middle of  a diplomatic rift, and the historically tense relationship has hit its lowest point in more than a decade.Takaichi found herself the target of China's ire in November, when she made comments suggesting that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan, the self-governed island it has long claimed. She has since refused to retract the statement.Trump's endorsement of her comes as tensions between them continue, and a day after he had a phone call with China's leader Xi Jinping. Xi called Taiwan \"the most important issue\" in their relationship, emphasising that Taiwan was \"China's territory\", Chinese state media reported. He also told Trump that Washington should be \"prudent\" when supplying weapons to the self-governed island which China has long claimed.Polls so far are predicting a landslide for Takaichi but winning Sunday's election will just be the first of several hurdles. Her leadership will be defined by how she manages Japan's stagnant economy and the delicate relationship with the US, its most critical security ally, as well as China, its largest trading partner.",

    "body": "3 hours agoHugh SchofieldParis correspondentAlamyThe two men, aged 27 and 29, had rented a property in Camblanes-et-Meynac, home to about 3,000 peopleTwo suspected Chinese spies, accused of using a sleepy village in south-western France to gather information, have been arrested.Residents of Camblanes-et-Meynac, about 15km (9 miles) from Bordeaux, grew suspicious when - after letting a house through rentals giant Airbnb - the Chinese pair erected a large parabolic antenna in the garden.The dish was directed at the sky and locals noticed that its installation coincided with a spate of cuts to their own internet service.Intelligence experts believe south-western France is being increasingly targeted by Chinese and other espionage because of the region's proximity to defence, aerospace and telecommunication sites.Last Saturday, officers from France's General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI) agency raided the house and seized a large quantity of computer equipment.The men - Chinese nationals aged 27 and 29 - were questioned at DGSI headquarters in the suburbs of France's capital Paris, and have now been charged with \"delivering information to a foreign power... likely to damage the interests [of France]\". They are being held in custody.The prosecutor's office said the men had arrived in France last month under work visas which said they were engineers at a company specialising in wireless communications.Two other men of Chinese origin, but living in France, have been charged with providing assistance. According to the prosecutor's office, the suspected spies were trying to \"capture satellite data from [X owner Elon Musk's] Starlink network, as well as data from vital entities, notably military, in order to retransmit them to their country of origin, China\".It is not the first time suspected Chinese spies have been caught in south-western France.Last summer, a 51-year-old Chinese engineer was detained in the village of Boulogne-sur-Gesse, about 40 miles south-west of Toulouse. She had also installed a satellite dish and was suspected of trying to intercept signals from the Issus-Aussaguel ground station in the Toulouse suburbs.Meanwhile, in December, a mathematics researcher at the University of Bordeaux's Institute of Mechanics and Engineering was placed under judicial investigation for \"providing information to a foreign power\" after he allegedly allowed members of a Chinese delegation into a restricted area.\"We do not know precisely what the pair at Camblanes-et-Meynac were up to, but the list of potential targets in the south-west of France is very large,\" said Jeremy André, an expert in Asian espionage at Intelligence Online.In addition to Issus-Aussaguel - which communicates with satellites used by the French military and intelligence - there is a major airbase at Bordeaux-Mérignac. Defence industries like Airbus, Thales and Dassault all have installations in the area.\"Since World War One, the south-west has been a vital zone for French defence research,\" André said. \"The idea was to focus activity as far as possible from the frontline, and then it stayed.\"He continued: \"We know that the Chinese have spent a lot of energy developing co-operation with towns and other collectivities in the south-west, via legitimate diplomatic and economic channels.\"In itself, there's nothing wrong with that, but in doing so they create a tissue of links which can be activated on demand.\"According to intelligence experts, French authorities have recently decided to take cases like this to court. Previously, they would have chosen to deal with them covertly, suggesting a greater determination to publicise the espionage threat from China.In Camblanes-et-Meynac, locals were bemused by the story. \"Here we tend to get artists, not spies,\" said Mayor Jean-Philippe Guillemeot. \"Maybe they just wanted somewhere nice and quiet.\"",

Dean Nyirenda was returning from a fishing trip with two friends on Wednesday when they bumped into the elephants. They ran away, with Nyirenda diving into a stream near the Luangwa River.\"That is when he was attacked by a crocodile by biting his right thigh,\" local police chief Robertson Mweemba told journalists. The southern African country has a thriving elephant population and clashes between humans and wildlife have claimed many lives in recent years.Police said Nyirenda had managed to escape the crocodile by hitting it with a stick which he had in his hands.\"He dragged himself from the stream,\" said MweembaHis two fellow fishermen, who had been watching from a distance, went to help him and carried him from the riverbank while he was bleeding heavily, state-run ZNBC news website reported.  \"They tried to stop the bleeding but unfortunately he died,\" added the police chief. Wildlife officers later visited the scene and found deep bite marks on the fisherman's right thigh, which had led to the fatal bleeding.The BBC has reached out to the authorities for comment.The Luangwa River, which flows through Zambia's South Luangwa National Park, is home to one of the highest concentrations of Nile crocodiles in Africa, according to conservationists. Of the 26 wildlife-related deaths recorded in 2023, 15 were caused by crocodile attacks, most of them along the Luangwa River, according to Resource Africa, a community-led conservation NGO.Zambian authorities have previously called on locals and tourists to exercise extreme caution when travelling through the country's wildlife hotspots.Wildlife authorities say they have been considering measures to reduce the human-animal conflicts, including building protective fences near wildlife areas.You may also be interested in: Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "2 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondentAFP via Getty ImagesThe US negotiators will be led by special envoy Steve Witkoff (left), while the Iranian team is headed by Foreign Minister Abbas AraghchiSenior US and Iranian officials are set to continue discussions after talks in Oman, the Iranian foreign minister says, amid a crisis that had raised fears of a conflict between the countries.Abbas Araghchi said the mediated discussions were a \"good beginning\" and \"exclusively nuclear\", and the negotiators would now return to their capitals for consultations.Ahead of the talks, US officials said they also wanted to discuss Iran's ballistic missiles and its support for regional armed groups, which underscored the gaps between the countries' positions. There has been no immediate US reaction.The talks came against the backdrop of a US military build up in the Middle East in response to Iran's violent repression of nationwide anti-government protests last month, which human rights groups say killed many thousands of people.In recent weeks, President Donald Trump has threatened to bomb Iran if it does not reach a deal. The US has sent thousands of troops and what Trump has described as an \"armada\" to the region, including an aircraft carrier along with other warships as well as fighter jets.Iran, meanwhile, has vowed to respond to an attack with force, threatening to strike American military assets in the Middle East and Israel.Speaking to Iranian state television, Araghchi said there was an \"atmosphere of mistrust\" between the two sides that \"must be overcome\", and details about the possible next round of talks would be decided later.Friday's discussions were mediated by Oman's Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi, who said in a post on social media they had been \"useful to clarify both Iranian and American thinking and identify areas for possible progress\".Araghchi led the Iranian delegation, while the US was represented by special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.These were the first talks involving US and Iranian officials since before the war between Israel and Iran last June, when the US bombed Iran's three main nuclear facilities. Despite the prospect of further meetings, it remains unclear whether a deal is possible as major differences remain.For Iran's embattled leaders, this could mean a chance to avert US military action that could further destabilise the regime, which analysts say is in its weakest position since it came to power following the 1979 Islamic Revolution.Watch: Iran's supreme leader 'should be very worried' amid tensions, Trump saysTrump's threats came as Iran's security forces brutally repressed large-scale demonstrations, which were triggered by a deepening economic crisis, and saw protesters calling for the end of the Islamic Republic.The Human Rights Activists News Agency, a Washington-based group, said it had confirmed at least 6,941 deaths, warning the number could be much higher, and that more than 50,000 people had been arrested.The current stand-off has brought the issue of Iran's nuclear programme back to discussions, having been at the centre of a long-running dispute with the West. For decades, Iran has said its programme is for peaceful purposes, while the US and Israel have accused it of being part of an effort to develop a weapon.Iranian officials have indicated being open to concessions, which could include the creation of a regional consortium for uranium enrichment, as proposed during talks with the US that collapsed when Israel launched its surprise attack on Iran, as well as discussions about transferring its stockpile of highly enriched uranium - 400kg (880lb) - to a third country.At the same time, Iran says demands to limit the country's ballistic missile programme and to end the support for proxies in the region - an alliance Tehran calls the \"Axis of Resistance\" that includes Hamas in Gaza, militias in Iraq, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen - are unacceptable and a breach of its sovereignty.In any case, Iran is expected to demand the lifting of sanctions that have crippled its economy. Opponents of the regime say any relief would give the clerical rulers a lifeline.For the US, the negotiations could offer an off-ramp for Trump from his military threats. Countries in the region are concerned a US strike could lead to a wider conflict or long-term chaos in Iran, and have warned air power alone would not be able to topple the Iranian leadership.Asked if Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei should be worried, Trump told NBC News on Wednesday: \"I would say he should be very worried. Yeah, he should be.\"On the same day, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the discussions would have to go beyond the nuclear issue for \"something meaningful\" to be achieved. \"I'm not sure you can reach a deal with these guys, but we're going to try to find out,\" he said. \"We don't see there's any harm in trying to figure out if there's something that can be done.\"",

    "body": "47 minutes agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseGetty ImagesTrump and other administration officials routinely share memes and AI-generated imageryUS President Donald Trump has removed a social media video which included a racist clip depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes.The clip - set to the song The Lion Sleeps Tonight - was at the end of a 62-second video he shared containing claims about voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.Republican Senator Tim Scott - who is black - had called for the president to remove the post, describing it as  \"the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House\".The White House initially defended the clip as an \"internet meme video\" and told critics to \"stop the fake outrage\".After a growing backlash, including from several Republican senators, the post was removed from Trump's Truth Social account and a White House official said that a staffer had \"erroneously\" made the post.The clip - which recalls racist caricatures comparing black people to monkeys - appears to be taken from an X post shared by conservative meme creator Xerias in October. That video also depicts several other high-profile Democrats as animals, including New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Trump's predecessor in the White House, Joe Biden, is also depicted as an ape eating a banana. The Obamas have yet to comment on the video. While the president offered no comment in his post, his sharing of the video - one of dozens posted on his Truth Social account overnight - sparked a fierce backlash. Some criticism came from within Trump's own party. Senator Scott, a black South Carolina Republican and an ally of Trump, posted that he was \"praying it was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House\".\"The President should remove it,\" he added. Another Republican, New York representative Mike Lawler, called the post \"wrong and incredibly offensive - whether intentional or a mistake\" and said it \"should be deleted immediately with an apology offered.\" The criticism continued even after the post was taken down. John Curtis, a Republican Senator from Utah, posted on social media that the video was \"blatantly racist and inexcusable\". \"It should never have been posted or left published for so long,\" he wrote. According to CBS, the BBC's US partner, Florida representative Byron Donalds - a longtime supporter of Trump's who is running for governor - called the White House after the video was posted and was told that it was the work of a staffer who \"let the president down\". In a statement sent to the BBC, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the clip is from \"an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King\". \"Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public,\" she added. Before it was removed, Derrick Johnson, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP, called the video \"disgusting and utterly despicable\" and accused Trump of attempting to distract the public from the Epstein case and a \"rapidly failing economy.\" Ben Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser for strategic communications in the Obama White House, said: \"Let it haunt Trump and his racist followers that future Americans will embrace the Obamas as beloved figures while studying him as a stain on our country.\" In a short post of his own, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said that \"Donald Trump is a racist\". \"Disgusting behaviour by the president,\" the office of California Governor Gavin Newsom wrote on X. \"Every single Republican must denounce this. Now.\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries - who himself accused Trump of racism last year after he shared an AI-image depicting Jeffries with a mustache and sombrero - responded to the recent video by calling Trump a \"vile, unhinged and malignant bottom feeder\". \"Every single Republican must immediately denounce Donald Trump's disgusting bigotry,\" he added. The clip of the Obamas was added to the end of a minute-long video which included claims about a voting conspiracy in Michigan in the 2020 presidential election. Those claims were debunked as part of Dominion Voting System's successful civil legal actions against some media companies.Trump also has a long history of criticising and attacking Obama.Before his first term as president, Trump regularly made false claims that the Hawaii-born Obama was actually born in Kenya and therefore was ineligible to be president.He later acknowledged that Obama was born in the US.",

    "body": "20 hours agoAshay YedgeBBC MarathiDevesh Chopra/BBCThese women work with the local forest department to track and protect the snow leopard species In one of India's coldest and most remote regions, a group of women have taken on an unlikely role: protecting one of Asia's most elusive predators, the snow leopard.Snow leopards are found in just 12 countries across Central and South Asia. India is home to one of the world's largest populations, with a nationwide survey in 2023 - the first comprehensive count ever carried out in the country - estimating more than 700 animals, .One of the places they roam is around Kibber village in Himachal Pradesh state's Spiti Valley, a stark, high-altitude cold desert along the Himalayan belt. Here, snow leopards are often called the \"ghosts of the mountains\", slipping silently across rocky slopes and rarely revealing themselves.For generations, the animals were seen largely as a threat, for attacking livestock. But attitudes in Kibber and neighbouring villages are beginning to shift, as people increasingly recognise the snow leopard's role as a top predator in the food chain and its importance in maintaining the region's fragile mountain ecosystem.Nearly a dozen local women are now working alongside the Himachal Pradesh forest department and conservationists to track and protect the species, playing a growing role in conservation efforts.Locally, the snow leopard is known as Shen and the women call their group \"Shenmo\". Trained to install and monitor camera traps, they handle devices fitted with unique IDs and memory cards that automatically photograph snow leopards as they pass.\"Earlier, men used to go and install the cameras and we kept wondering why couldn't we do it too,\" says Lobzang Yangchen, a local coordinator working with a small group supported by the non-profit Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF) in collaboration with the forest department.Yangchen was among the women who helped collect data for Himachal Pradesh's snow leopard survey in 2024, which found that the state was home to 83 snow leopards - up from 51 in 2021.Spiti Wildlife DivisionSnow leopards are often called the \"ghosts of the mountains\" because they are so hard to spotThe survey documented snow leopards and 43 other species using camera traps spread across an area of nearly 26,000sq km (10,000sq miles). Individual leopards were identified by the unique rosette patterns on their fur, a standard technique used for spotted big cats. The findings are now feeding into wider conservation and habitat-management plans.\"Their contribution was critical to identifying individual animals,\" says Goldy Chhabra, deputy conservator of forests with the Spiti Wildlife Division.Collecting the data is demanding work. Most of it takes place in winter, when heavy snowfall pushes snow leopards and their prey to lower altitudes, making their routes easier to track.On survey days, the women wake up early, finish household chores and gather at a base camp before travelling by vehicle as far as the terrain allows. From there, they trek several kilometres to reach camera sites, often at altitudes above 14,000ft (4,300m), where the thin air makes even simple movement exhausting.The BBC accompanied the group on one such trek in December. After hours of walking in biting cold, the women suddenly stopped on a narrow trail.Yangchen points to pugmarks in the dust: \"This shows the snow leopard has been here recently. These pugmarks are fresh.\"Devesh Chopra/BBCThe women set up cameras with unique IDs and memory cards, which capture an image of a snow leopard as soon as it passes throughAlong with pugmarks, the team looks for other signs, including scrapes and scent‑marking spots, before carefully fixing a camera to a rock along the trail.One woman then carries out a \"walk test\", crawling along the path to check whether the camera's height and angle will capture a clear image.The group then moves on to older sites, retrieving memory cards and replacing batteries installed weeks earlier.By mid-afternoon, they return to camp to log and analyse the images using specialised software - tools many had never encountered before.\"I studied only until grade five,\" says Chhering Lanzom. \"At first, I was scared to use the computer. But slowly, we learned how to use the keyboard and mouse.\"The women joined the camera-trapping programme in 2023. Initially, conservation was not their motivation. But winters in the Spiti Valley are long and quiet, with little agricultural work to fall back on. \"At first, this work on snow leopards didn't interest us,\" Lobzang says. \"We joined because we were curious and we could earn a small income.\"The women earn between 500 ($5.46; £4) and 700 rupees a day. But beyond the money, the work has helped transform how the community views the animal.Spiti Wildlife DivisionImages captured by the camera traps are analysed using a special software\"Earlier, we thought the snow leopard was our enemy,\" says Dolma Zangmo, a local resident. \"Now we think their conservation is important.\"Alongside survey work, the women help villagers access government insurance schemes for their livestock and promote the use of predator‑proof corrals - stone or mesh enclosures that protect animals at night.Their efforts come at a time of growing recognition for the region. Spiti Valley has recently been included in the Cold Desert Biosphere Reserve, a Unesco-recognised network aimed at conserving fragile ecosystems while supporting local livelihoods.As climate change reshapes the fragile trans-Himalayan landscape, conservationists say such community participation will be crucial to safeguarding species like the snow leopard.\"Once communities are involved, conservation becomes more sustainable,\" says Deepshikha Sharma, programme manager with NCF's High Altitudes initiative.\"These women are not just assisting, they are becoming practitioners of wildlife conservation and monitoring,\" she adds.As for the women, their work makes them feel closer to their home, the village and the mountains that raised them, they say. \"We were born here, this is all we know,\" Lobzang says. \"Sometimes we feel afraid because these snow leopards are after all predatory animals, but this is where we belong.\"",

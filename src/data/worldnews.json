    "body": "German nurse gets life in jail after murdering 10 to reduce workload2 hours agoTabby WilsonGetty ImagesA palliative care nurse in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison after he was convicted of the murder of 10 patients and the attempted murder of 27 others.Prosecutors alleged that the man, who has not been publicly named, injected his mostly elderly patients with painkillers or sedatives in an effort to ease his workload during shifts overnight.The offences were committed between December 2023 and May 2024 in a hospital in Wuerselen, in western Germany. Investigators are reported to be looking into several other suspicious cases during his career.According to media outlet Agence France-Presse (AFP), the unnamed man had employed at the hospital in Wuerselen since 2020, after completing training as a nursing professional in 2007. Prosecutors told a court in Aachen that he showed \"irritation\" and a lack of empathy to patients who required a higher level of care, and accused him of playing \"master of life and death\". The court was told that he injected patients with large doses of morphine and midazolam, a muscle relaxant, in an effort to reduce his workload during night shifts.He was arrested in 2024.When issuing the life sentence, the court said that the man's crimes carried a \"particular severity of guilt\" which should bar him from early release after 15 years.He will be able to appeal the verdict.Prosecutors have told AFP that exhumations are taking place to identify further potential victims, which could see the man put on trial again.The case bears similarity to that of former nurse Niels Högel, who was handed a life sentence in 2019 after he was convicted of murdering 85 patients at two hospitals in northern Germany. A court found that he administered lethal doses of heart medication to people in his care between 1999 and 2005.He is believed to be the most prolific killer in Germany's modern history.",

    "body": "8 hours agoAnbarasan EthirajanGlobal News ReporterItaly says seven of its citizens are missing in Nepal after trying to climb a Himalayan peak in the north-east of the country.Officials said the Italian team was at the base camp of Dolma Khang peak, which has an elevation of 6,332m (20,774ft), in Dolakha district.Three other Italian climbers have been confirmed dead this week, including in an avalanche that struck close to Dolma Khang on Monday. A senior Italian diplomat from neighbouring India has arrived in Kathmandu to coordinate with the Nepalese authorities and search teams.Nepal has been hit by avalanches and ferocious storms in the past week, killing and injuring a number of climbers and their local guides.\"At this stage, the local authorities have confirmed the deaths of three Italian climbers,\" Rome's foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. \"There remains no news of seven other Italian nationals, including Marco Di Marcello and Markus Kircheler.\"The foreign ministry said both Mr Marcello and Mr Kircheler were in the Yalung Ri area, where Monday's avalanche struck. Italian Paolo Cocco was among seven climbers who were already confirmed to have died near the Yalung Ri base camp. On Tuesday, Mr Marcello's family told Italy's Ansa news agency that his satellite radio signal was continuing to update and appeared to be moving. A Nepali tourism official, Ram Krishna Lamichhane, told the BBC they had been in contact with rescue teams searching the base camp at Dolma Khang peak, which was hit by an avalanche.\"According to the information we have, five people, including three foreign climbers and two Nepali guides, are missing in the Dolma Khang base camp area,\" Mr Lamichhane said.There have been conflicting reports about the number of dead and missing climbers in the area in recent days, as well as their nationalities. Mr Lamichhane added that they were also coordinating with the trekking agency that had organised their expedition to Dolma Khang to find out more details on the missing.As well as Paolo Cocco, the bodies of two other Italian climbers who went missing while attempting to scale the Panbari peak in western Nepal have also been recovered. Stefano Farronato and Alessandro Caputo were part of a three-man group that became stranded along with three local guides last week.The group had been granted permission to climb the 6,887m peak, but were reported missing when they lost contact with the base camp following heavy snowfall on 28 October.The third member of the group, another Italian man, was rescued along with one sherpa.Autumn is a popular season for trekkers and mountaineers in Nepal as weather conditions and visibility have tended to be better. However, the risk of severe weather and avalanches remains.Last week, Cyclone Montha triggered heavy rain and snowfall across Nepal, stranding people in the Himalayas.",

    "body": "2 hours agoLana LamSydneyPeter MumbyThe Great Barrier Reef has suffered mass bleaching events in recent yearsThe Great Barrier Reef is headed for a \"grim future\" and will suffer a \"rapid coral decline\" by 2050 but parts may recover if global warming is kept below 2C, a new study has found.Researchers at the University of Queensland (UQ) used modelling to simulate the lifecycles of certain coral species and found that some were better at adapting to warmer oceans and could help new coral grow.Reefs near cooler-water currents were also more resilient, giving a \"glimmer of hope\" to the natural wonder, which has suffered severe climate-induced heat stress in recent years.The study warned that curbing carbon emissions was crucial to allow coral to recover and avoid a \"near collapse\" of the reef.Dr Yves-Marie Bozec, who led the research, said the modelling of more than 3,800 individual reefs that make up the Great Barrier Reef looked at their \"eco-evolutionary dynamics\". This included how corals interact with each other, how they deal with warmer water and corals in naturally cooler areas.\"We ran all of those factors with the most up-to-date climate projections - and the news was not good,\" he said.\"We forecast a rapid coral decline before the middle of this century regardless of the emissions scenario.\"The Great Barrier Reef is one of the world's most biodiverse ecosystems, stretching more than 2,300km (1,400 miles) off Australia's north-east coast.It has suffered four significant marine heatwaves between 2016 and 2022, causing much of its coral to expel the algae which gives them life and colour - a process called bleaching, which is often fatal.A recent report found that parts of the Great Barrier Reef had suffered the largest annual decline in coral cover since records began nearly 40 years ago.Dr Bozec said some parts of the reef \"may partially recover after 2050, but only if ocean warming is sufficiently slow to allow natural adaptation to keep pace with temperature changes\".\"Adaptation may keep pace if global warming does not exceed two degrees by 2100. For that to happen, more action is needed globally to reduce carbon emissions which are driving climate change.\"Dr Bozec said: \"The window for meaningful action is closing rapidly but it hasn't shut\".Under the Paris agreement, almost 200 nations have pledged to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C and to keep them \"well below\" 2C above those recorded in pre-industrial times, generally considered to mean the late 19th Century.Prof Peter Mumby, who also worked on the study, said they found \"many reefs could persist under the Paris agreement target of two degrees of warming\".\"However, higher emissions leading to faster temperature rises would drive most reefs to a near collapse,\" he said. Prof Murphy said reefs in areas \"where the water doesn't heat up so dramatically because it is well mixed, fared better than others\" and reefs close to populations of corals that can regenerate were also healthier.Identifying areas of the reef network that are more resilient will mean efforts to protect the reef can focus on \"strategic parts\" of the ecosystem, he added.Watch: Can you un-bleach coral?

    "body": "Hamas has handed over to the Red Cross a coffin containing what it says is the body of another deceased hostage, the Israeli military has said.The remains have been transferred to Israeli forces, who will take them to the National Centre of Foreign Medicine in Tel Aviv for identification.Under the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal with Israel, which started nearly a month ago, Hamas agreed to return all 20 living and 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages it was holding within 72 hours.Israel has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the dead hostages' bodies, while Hamas has insisted it is struggling to find them under rubble.If the latest remains are confirmed as those of a dead hostage, it will mean six others are still in Gaza – including Israelis and foreign nationals.All the remaining living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has also handed over the bodies of 300 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the Israeli hostages and those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.On Tuesday, the remains of Israeli-American soldier Itay Chen, 19, were returned.Staff Sgt Chen was serving as a soldier in the IDF's 7th Brigade when Hamas-led gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023.The IDF said he was killed inside a tank during a battle in Kibbutz Nir Oz and that his body was taken to Gaza as a hostage by Hamas.The slow progress over the return of the hostages has meant there has been no advance on the second phase of President Trump's Gaza peace plan. This includes plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas, and reconstruction.Israel has allowed members of the Palestinian armed group and Red Cross staff to search for remains in areas still controlled by Israeli forces.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "Several contestants have walked out of a Miss Universe event after an official from host nation Thailand publicly berated Miss Mexico in a tense confrontation. At a pre-pageant ceremony, Miss Universe Thailand director Nawat Itsaragrisil told off Fatima Bosch in front of dozens of contestants for failing to post promotional content.When she objected, Mr Nawat called security and threatened to disqualify those supporting her. Ms Bosch then left the room and others joined her in solidarity.Video of the incident, which was live streamed, has been shared online. The Miss Universe Organisation (MUO) has condemned Mr Nawat's \"malicious\" behaviour, for which he has since apologised.The Miss Universe contestants, who are the winners of national pageants in their home countries, attended Tuesday's event in their sashes and gowns.Some can be heard shouting back at Mr Nawat in the video, after he raises his voice to reprimand Ms Bosch and repeatedly tells her to stop talking. As many of them stand to show support, Mr Nawat says: \"If anyone wants to continue the contest, sit down. If you step out, the rest of the girls continue.\"Despite this, the majority of the women in the video appear standing, with several heading towards the door.After leaving the event on Tuesday, Ms Bosch told the press the 60-year-old executive was \"not respectful\" and said he had called her \"dumb\". Mr Nawat has disputed this, claiming his words had been misunderstood. He is widely reported to have called the 25-year-old a \"dumbhead\". But at a press conference he later claimed he was saying she had caused \"damage\".His conduct prompted a stern rebuke from the MUO, which has sent a delegation of international executives to take over running the competition.In a video statement, MUO President Raul Rocha said Mr Nawat had \"forgotten the true meaning of what it means to be a genuine host\". He said the Thai official had \"humiliated, insulted and showed a lack of respect\" to Ms Bosch, and committed the \"serious abuse of having called security to intimidate a defenceless woman\".Mr Nawat's participation in the pageant would be limited \"as much as possible\" or eliminated entirely, he said, adding the MUO would be taking \"legal actions\" against him.\"I wish to reiterate that Miss Universe is an empowerment platform for women so that their voices can be heard in the world,\" Mr Rocha said.Among those to walk out on Tuesday was reigning Miss Universe Victoria Kjaer Theilvig of Denmark. \"This is about women's rights,\" she said as she left the event. \"This is not how things should be handled. To trash another girl is beyond disrespectful... That's why I'm taking my coat and I'm walking out.\"Ms Bosch later said in an interview: \"I just want to let my country know, I'm not afraid to make my voice heard. It's here stronger than ever. I have a purpose. I have things to say.\"We're in the 21st century. I'm not a doll to be made up, styled and have my clothes changed,\" she added. \"I came here to be a voice for all the women and all the girls who fight for causes and to tell my country that I'm completely committed to that.\"Video of Mr Nawat has outraged fans of the pageant, with many heavily criticising his actions and praising Ms Bosch's response.In a social media video statement, Mr Nawat said: \"If anyone feels bad, uncomfortable, or affected, I apologise to everyone. I especially apologised to the girls who were present, around 75 of them.\"The Miss Universe competition has pressed on despite this controversy, with contestants taking part in a welcome event in Bangkok on Wednesday.The winner will be crowned the new Miss Universe on 21 November.",

    "body": "The death toll from flooding caused by one of the strongest typhoons this year in the central Philippines has risen to at least 114, authorities said on Thursday. Typhoon Kalmaegi has flooded entire towns on Cebu, the region's most populous island, where 71 deaths were reported. Another 127 are missing and 82 injured, officials said.Cebu provincial authorities reported an additional 28 deaths, which were not included in the tally released by the national civil defence office, according to AFP news agency.Kalmaegi left the Philippines on Thursday morning and is currently moving toward central Vietnam, where residents are still reeling from floods that have already killed dozens of people.Most of the deaths were due to drowning, reports said. The storm sent torrents of muddy water down hillsides and into towns and cities.Damage to Cebu's residential areas was extensive, with many small buildings swept away and a thick carpet of mud left by the retreating floodwaters.Local officials described the havoc wrought by the storm as \"unprecedented\". Residents returning to their destroyed homes are reeling from the deadly floods earlier this week.Jel-an Moira Servas, a business owner who lives in Mandaue city, told the BBC that she found herself waist-deep in water within minutes when her house became flooded. She quickly evacuated with her family, bringing only light items like food and electronics.\"Right now, the rain has completely stopped and the sun is out, but our houses are still filled with mud, and everything inside is in shambles,\" she said. \"We don't even know where to start cleaning. I can't even look at it without crying.\"The national disaster agency said more than 400,000 people had been displaced by the disaster in Cebu, home to 2.5 million people.The official death toll also includes six crew members of a military helicopter that crashed on Mindanao island, south of Cebu, after it was deployed to assist in relief efforts on Tuesday.Carlos Jose Lañas, a volunteer rescuer, told the BBC that despite preparing for the worst case, they were caught off-guard by the extent of the flooding.\"This is the worst flood I've ever experienced,\" the 19-year-old said. \"Almost all the rivers here in Cebu overflowed. Even emergency responders did not expect this kind of scenario.\"\"The rescue operation was too overwhelming for the emergency responders around Cebu, because there were a lot of people asking for help.\"Typhoon Kalmaegi, locally called Tino, is the 20th tropical cyclone this year to hit the Philippines, a country prone to powerful storms.It comes barely a month after back-to-back typhoons killed over a dozen people and wrought damage to infrastructure and crops.Super Typhoon Ragasa, known locally as Nando, struck in late September, followed swiftly by Typhoon Bualoi, known locally as Opong.In the months before, an extraordinarily wet monsoon season caused widespread flooding, sparking anger and protests over unfinished and sub-standard flood control systems that have been blamed on corruption.Typhoon Kalmaegi left the Philippines at 00:30 local time (16:30pm GMT) on Thursday morning.It has since strengthened, with maximum sustained winds increasing from 150 km/h to 155 km/h.  It is expected to make landfall in central Vietnam on Friday morning, according to forecasts. More than 50 flights there have been cancelled or rescheduled.Vietnam has already been battling with a week of flooding and record rains that burst riverbanks and flooded some of the country's most popular tourist spots.Thailand is also bracing for the storm's impact, with local officials warning of possible flash floods, landslides and river overflows caused by Kalmaegi.",

    "body": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned there will be a 10% reduction in air travel capacity at 40 major airports in the US starting Friday morning, if the government shutdown continues.The decision was made because air traffic controllers have been reporting issues with fatigue, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)  said at a briefing with Duffy on Wednesday.\"It is unusual, just as the shutdown is unusual, just as the fact that our controllers haven't been paid for a month is unusual,\" said FAA chief Bryan BedfordDuring the shutdown, now the longest in US history, controllers have had to keep working without pay, prompting some to call out sick or take side jobs.Watch: \"There will be frustration\" - Transport secretary outlines reduction in air trafficThe flight reductions will be gradual, starting at 4% of domestic flights on Friday, then rising to 5% on Saturday and 6% on Sunday, before hitting the full 10% next week, Reuters reported after the announcement, citing four unnamed sources. The names of the affected airports - all high-traffic locations - will be released on Thursday, the officials said.The cancellations could affect between 3,500 and 4,000 flights per day. \"We are seeing pressures build in a way that we don't feel - if we allow it to go unchecked - will allow us to continue to tell the public that we operate the safest airline system in the world,\" Bedford said.Duffy said air travel is still safe, and the decision to cancel the flights was being made to maintain safety and efficiency. If the shutdown continues and adds more pressure to the system, additional restrictive measures may be required, Bedford said. In a statement, American Airlines, the second-largest carrier in North America, said it was awaiting additional information from the FAA so it could determine which flights will be scrapped, but that \"we expect the vast majority of our customers' travel will be unaffected\".A spokesperson for Southwest Airlines, the fourth largest, said in a statement that the company is still evaluating how the flight restrictions will affect its services, and will let customers know as soon as possible. \"We continue to urge Congress to immediately resolve its impasse and restore the National Airspace System to its full capacity,\" the spokesperson added.Delta Airlines declined to comment. The BBC has also reached out to other major US airlines. Once government funds ran out on 1 October, most federal workers were sent home and told they would be paid once the government reopened. Those deemed essential, like controllers, though, had to keep doing their jobs without pay.Almost immediately after the shutdown started, airports began feeling the effects. Some had to ground flights for hours after air traffic controllers called out sick, while others relied on controllers from other airports.Nick Daniels, the president of the labor union representing more than 20,000 aviation workers, put the situation into stark terms on Wednesday. \"Air traffic controllers are texting 'I don't even have enough money to put gas in my car to come to work,'\" he told CNN.\"We base what we do day in and day out on predictability,\" he said. \"Right now there is no predictability.\"Duffy warned earlier this week that the flight cancellations may be coming, as half of the country's 30 major airports experience staff shortages. He previously said there's a risk that comes with air traffic controllers taking on additional jobs during the shutdown, and had threatened to fire controllers who do not come to work.\"They have to make a decision, do I go to work and not get a paycheque and not put food on the table? Or do I drive for Uber or DoorDash or wait tables?\" Duffy said on ABC on Sunday. ",

    "body": "9 hours agoAndrew HardingParis correspondentReutersFrench police have launched an investigation into sex-trafficking linked to the disgraced businessman Mohamed Al Fayed, who died two years ago.The police investigation, ordered by the Paris prosecutor's office, will focus on \"potential acts of aggravated human trafficking… with multiple victims,\" according to correspondence seen by the BBC. Prostitution and one case of rape are also being investigated.Al Fayed's Ritz Hotel in Paris will likely be a target of the investigation, amid claims from victims that staff knew about or facilitated the abuse of women.In a statement, the Ritz said it was \"deeply alarmed\" by the allegations of abuse and it would cooperate \"fully\" with authorities.The trafficking investigation marks a new twist in a series of legal battles linked to Al Fayed's violent crimes and to the search – both before and since his death – for some sort of justice for his many victims.An American woman, Pelham Spong, 40, played a key role in triggering this investigation in France, where it is alleged that Al Fayed moved young female staff from the Ritz to his private house in Paris and to various yachts and family homes on the Mediterranean coast.Ms Spong was living in Paris in 2008 when she applied for a job working as a personal assistant for the Al Fayed family in Monaco. She was brought to London several times, subjected to an intrusive gynaecological examination, and then – she alleges - sexually assaulted by Al Fayed in his office on Park Lane.\"He told me the job entailed sleeping with him,\" Ms Spong said, adding that she declined the offer on the spot.\"I didn't realise I was a victim of sex trafficking until this past year when I… saw the scale and scope of the abuse and realised that it was a pattern and a system and a machine,\" she told the BBC in an interview in Paris.Pelham Spong was 23 years old when she first applied to work for Al Fayed's familyA few months ago, Ms Spong, now living back in the USA, came to Paris to report her experiences to the French police, hoping that it might persuade other women to come forward with evidence of their own abuse.\"It's a big step that the prosecutors decided to open an investigation. [Ms Spong] has a really good case because she kept a lot of materials. It will be very strong,\" her lawyer, Anne-Claire Le Jeune told the BBC.Ms Spong said it is \"so much easier to dismiss the actions of an evil man that's dead\". \"And you can't learn anything from that as a society. So how do you prevent this happening again? \"Well, first, you have to name what it... It's critical to call it what it is, trafficking, so that we can prevent it,\" she said.Ms Spong's lawyer, Anne-Claire Le Jeune, says her client has a \"very strong\" caseAl Fayed is also being investigated in the UK, where more than 140 people have reported him to the Met Police.The extent of Al Fayed's predatory behaviour was first brought to light by a BBC documentary and podcast, broadcast in September 2024.Al Fayed: Predator at Harrods heard testimony from more than 20 female ex-Harrods employees who said Al Fayed sexually assaulted or raped them. Since then, dozens more women have come forward with similar experiences.After the broadcast, the Met revealed it had been approached by 21 women before Al Fayed's death, who accused him of sexual offences including rape, sexual assault and trafficking. Despite this, he was never charged with any offences.Ms Spong herself says she spoke to British police about Al Fayed in 2017 but was told he was too ill to be questioned.Earlier this year, the Met wrote to alleged victims apologising, saying it was \"truly sorry\" for the distress they have suffered because Al Fayed will never face justice. The force is currently investigating its handling of historical allegations against Al Fayed and looking into whether others could face charges for enabling his behaviour.Harrods has set aside more than £60m in its plan to compensate alleged victims of Al Fayed's abuse. In a statement announcing the scheme, Harrods said: \"While we cannot undo the past, we have been determined to do the right thing as an organisation, driven by the values we hold today, while ensuring that such behaviour can never be repeated in the future.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoWill GrantCentral America and Cuba correspondentMexico President Claudia Sheinbaum has said she will press charges against a man who groped her during a public appearance.Mobile phone footage of the incident on Tuesday shows Sheinbaum speaking to a group of supporters on a street near the National Palace in Mexico City. In the video, a man approaches her from behind and attempts to kiss her on the neck and place his hands on her body. Sheinbaum moved away quickly and a member of her team stepped in, but she was visibly shaken. The offender has been arrested.\"My view is, if I don't file a complaint, what will happen to other Mexican women? If they do this to the president, what will happen to all women in our country?\" Sheinbaum said at a news conference on Wednesday.\"I decided to press charges because this is something that I experienced as a woman, but that we as women experience in our country,\" she said. \"I have experienced it before, when I wasn't president, when I was a student.\"She added that she had decided to press ahead with bringing charges against the suspect as he had allegedly harassed other women in the crowd.\"A line must be drawn,\" she said.Women's rights groups and feminist commentators have said the incident shows the extent of ingrained machismo in Mexican society, where a man believes he has the right to accost even the president if she is a woman. Femicide is also a huge problem in Mexico, with a staggering 98% of gender-based murders estimated to go unpunished.Sheinbaum promised to tackle the issue as a candidate, but so far in her administration there has been no discernible improvement in that area of violent crime.The incident also comes amid discussions about presidential security and the wider safety of politicians.As president, Sheinbaum has broadly followed the approach of her predecessor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, in having close and regular contact with her supporters on the streets or in campaign events. On occasion, that has presented security concerns for her team. However, she confirmed in her new conference she had no intention of changing her policy of interacting with her supporters.The incident also happened just days after the murder of Carlos Manzo, the mayor of Uruapan, a municipality in the violent state of Michoacan, at the local Day of the Dead celebrations.Manzo had called on Sheinbaum for greater federal support in Uruapan in the fight against drug cartels. Around 35 candidates were killed in the lead up to the general election last year in what was considered the bloodiest campaign in modern Mexico.Since taking office, Sheinbaum has made in-roads in improving the country's dire security situation, particularly clamping down on fentanyl-trafficking – a key issue for her US counterpart, President Trump.",

    "body": "1 hour agoMeryl Sebastian & Devina GuptaBBC NewsGetty ImagesPolling officials at an election centre in Bihar's capital Patna, two days before the first phase of votingVoting has begun in the eastern Indian state of Bihar where more than 74 million people are eligible to vote in a crucial election that will be a precursor to several key state polls.Voters will cast their ballots for 243 seats in a two-phase election to choose the next state government. Counting of votes is scheduled for 14 November.The election comes after a controversial revision of electoral rolls that the opposition alleged would exclude genuine voters and give an edge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The BJP and India's Election Commission have denied these allegations.Bihar is one of India's poorest and most populous states, which sees millions migrating to other states for jobs. It is also among the few states in India where Modi's party has not managed to form a government yet on its own.The outgoing government is an alliance between the BJP and the Janata Dal (United), or JD(U). They are contesting the elections again together while India's main opposition Congress party has tied up with the regional Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and a number of smaller parties.The election has also seen the entry of a new political party led by Prashant Kishor, a political consultant who has in the past worked with both the BJP and the Congress.The election is also being closely watched as it might be the last to see active participation from two leaders who have shaped Bihar's politics for almost four decades - JD(U)'s Nitish Kumar and RJD's Lalu Prasad Yadav. The rivals, who are said to be in poor health, have on occasion joined hands to stay in power.Getty ImagesNitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad Yadav have shaped much of Bihar's politics in the last few decadesIncumbent chief minister Kumar is one of the state's most influential leaders and has led the government for the major part of the past two decades.He is a key ally of the BJP and played a crucial role in helping Modi's party form the federal government after the 2024 election. RJD's Lalu Yadav served as chief minister from 1990-97. Known for his colourful personality and witty one-liners, Yadav's rise as a politician who championed marginalised caste groups transformed the political landscape of the state. His party's years in power, however, became associated with misrule and corruption. He is currently out on bail after being convicted in corruption cases.Yadav's sons Tejashwi has been projected as the chief minister candidate for the opposition alliance.Getty ImagesPrashant Kishor, considered one of India's best known political consultants, has entered the fray with his Jan Suraaj PartyThe election comes on the back of a controversial voter list revision carried out by India's Election Commission a few months ago. The commission released a list of 74.2 million voters in September, weeding out 4.7 million names.The exercise was sharply criticised by the opposition, which accused the commission of working dropping many voters - especially Muslims - to aid Modi's party. Both the BJP and the Election Commission denied this.New voters list in Indian state includes wrong photos and dead peopleAnalysts say female voters are expected to play a key role in these elections - nearly half of the voters are women and their turnout has seen a steady rise.Political analyst Santosh Singh says women in Bihar are more likely to vote over issues and that's why political parties are trying to target them with different welfare schemes. Both alliances have offered financial assistance to woo women voters.Earlier this week, the BBC met Kushboo Devi, 40, who's been campaigning for her local candidate in Masaurhi village. She says she has been trying to get everyone to come out and vote but her focus is on women. \"Because in Bihar, wherever you see a higher voting percentage, it's usually the women who are showing up at the poll booths.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoLaura Gozzi and Paul Kirby,Europe digital editorVolodymyr ZelenskyUkraine's Volodymyr Zelensky visited troops not far from Pokrovsk this weekUkraine could be facing its biggest loss for months, if the key eastern city of Pokrovsk falls to Russian forces. The battle for this strategic point on a big road and rail artery in the Donetsk region has been going on for well over a year.If Russia's Vladimir Putin were able to claim victory there, three years and 10 months into his full-scale war, he would be a step closer to his goal of controlling Ukraine's entire industrial east - the Donbas, made up of the neighbouring regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.How close is Pokrovsk to falling?Claims and counter-claims abound, so it is difficult to say.  But we do know Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops in the area, and hundreds of its soldiers have infiltrated the city in the past few weeks, gradually taking over buildings and streets and overwhelming Ukrainian positions.On Wednesday, Kyiv denied its forces in and around the town had been encircled and maintained they were still involved in \"active resistance\" and blocking out Russian troops. One Ukrainian regiment said it had cleared the city council building and posted video with the Ukrainian flag.Skelya regimentUkraine's \"Skelya\" assault regiment said they had cleared the city council building in Pokrovsk and raised the national flagHowever, open-source intelligence maps suggest Moscow's troops are probably occupying large areas of Pokrovsk.While Ukraine's official position is that it is holding its own against Russia, military personnel cited by a war correspondent for Ukraine's Hromadske website said Ukrainian troops were outnumbered and more than 1,000 soldiers were at risk of becoming surrounded.For its part Russia said it was continuing to advance northwards and thwarting attempts by Ukraine to break its troops out of encirclement. Ukrainian units were trapped in \"cauldrons\", the defence ministry said, although several commentators said that was not the case.Why is this city so important for Russia to capture?Russia's military has had its sights trained on Pokrovsk since it captured the eastern city of Avdiivka in February 2024.Its capture deprived Ukrainian of an important military stronghold in the Donetsk region, but it has since taken 21 months for Russia to advance about 40km (25 miles) to the northwest.Seizing Pokrovsk would put Vladimir Putin a step closer to his goal of occupying the entire Donbas, even if Russia's advance this year has been extremely slow.If Pokrovsk falls, defending its satellite city of Myrnohrad becomes almost untenable and Russian troops would then be able to turn their focus to the battle for Kostyantynivka to the north-east and the rest of the so-called \"fortress belt\" cities of Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk and Slovyansk.However, Ukraine still had defensive lines to withdraw to and could reset its defence, said analyst Michael Kofman of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"Russian forces lack momentum and the way they have been fighting won't generate it,\" he wrote on X. \"Infiltration yields a creeping offensive but can't yield operationally significant breakthroughs.\"What makes Pokrovsk significant for Ukraine to hold?Pokrovsk is largely deserted now, but it has played a significant strategic role for Ukraine's military during the full-scale invasion.Before the war it had a population of some 60,000 people and the city is close to Ukraine's only mine producing coking coal, which is vital for the steel industry. But there hasn't been any coal production there since the start of the year, when the town started being evacuated.Most importantly Pokrovsk is a key road and rail junction in the east, and losing the city could pave the way for Russian forces to advance on the more central Dnipropetrovsk region.Russian forces are already closing in on the main road to Pavlohrad and Dnipro and to the south-west they have advanced near the Donetsk border with Dnipropetrovsk. Another big road leads to Zaporizhzhia, the capital of another embattled region claimed by Russia.Would the fall of Pokrovsk change the war?Putin is understood to have demanded the handover of all of Donetsk as a condition for ending the war.But even if Pokrovsk falls that does not mean the rest of Donetsk would too.Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky has long insisted that Russia's military will have to keep fighting for several more years if it is to have any chance of fully occupying the entire Donbas.He is not alone. The Institute for the Study of War believes Russia has no means of \"rapidly enveloping or penetrating the fortress belt\" and says it would likely take several years.Russian defence ministryRussia's defence ministry posted footage of a Ukrainian village being bombed just outside PokrovskBut losing Pokrovsk would be a blow for Ukrainian morale at the start of a winter of Russian attacks on power supplies. It would also come at significant cost to manpower, resources and equipment that have been committed to defending the city.It might also influence US President Donald Trump's push for an end to the war and strengthen Moscow's negotiating position, proving to Trump that Russia is not the \"paper tiger\" he said it was earlier this autumn. Although he called off his bid to set up a summit with Putin out of frustration that the Russian leader would not agree to a ceasefire, Russian officials have not given up hope on a deal.Putin may hope that a Russian success will convince Trump to agree to his demands, even if Ukraine and its European allies reject them.",

    "body": "14 hours agoMadeline HalpertNew York CityWatch: Joy precedes scrutiny, reports Nada Tawfik from inside Mamdani's victory partyZohran Mamdani, 34, has won New York City's race for mayor in a contest that rallied young voters and sparked debate about the future direction of the US Democratic Party.Ugandan-born Mamdani, a Democrat, beat former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, to become the youngest person in over a century to lead the largest city in the US.\"My friends, we have toppled a political dynasty,\" the self-described democratic socialist told the crowd during a victory speech.Democrats also won governor races in Virginia and New Jersey, while in California voters backed a proposition to redraw the congressional electoral map ahead of next year's midterm elections. Mamdani made affordability the central message of his campaign, pledging to expand social programmes paid for by new taxes on high earners and corporations.In New York, he was a relatively unknown member of the state assembly until his campaign gained online momentum a few months ago, propelling him to victory in the Democratic primary contest over the summer.Mamdani has become the first South Asian and Muslim to lead the city. In his victory speech, he spoke of a \"new age\".\"For as long as we can remember, the working people of New York have been told by the wealthy and the well-connected that power does not belong in their hands,\" Mamdani said. \"The future is in our hands,\" he said, pledging to create a government that works \"for everyone\".Mamdani's campaign has drawn significant national attention, including from US President Donald Trump, who in the days before the vote threatened to withhold federal funds from New York if Mamdani won. The president calls Mamdani a communist - a label that Mamdani rejects.In overnight projections from BBC news partner CBS, Mamdani had secured 50.3% of the vote, compared with Cuomo's 41.6%. Republican Curtis Sliwa had just over 7%. Shortly after the winner was projected, Sliwa conceded.\"We have a mayor-elect,\" Sliwa told a group of supporters. \"Obviously I wish him good luck, because if he does well, we do well.\"Cuomo also conceded, congratulating Mamdani despite a chorus of boos from his supporters. But Cuomo highlighted that almost half of New Yorkers who voted had not picked Mamdani, and said his opponent had made \"promises that cannot be met\".There are questions over how Mamdani will pay for his ambitious social agenda and critics have questioned how a politician with no executive experience will handle a hostile Trump administration.On Tuesday night, Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson criticised the \"consequences\" of New York City's choice on social media platform X. \"Zohran Mamdani's election cements the Democrat Party's transformation to a radical, big-government socialist party,\" he wrote.The president also posted on social media, blaming the shutdown, and his not appearing on the ballot, for Republican losses Tuesday night. Wins for other Jay Jones and other DemocratsCentrist Democrats clinched victories in elections for governor on Tuesday night, with Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill winning races to run the states of Virginia and New Jersey respectively.The races were being viewed as an indication of how Americans were feeling about the national government's policies, although the latter state is reliably blue.In another closely watched contest in Virginia, Democratic candidate Jay Jones won the race for state attorney general, defeating incumbent Republican candidate Jason Miyares. That was despite a scandal over his historical text messages that wished violence against a political rival, for which Jones apologised.Voters in California also approved a measure to redraw political lines to favour Democrats, in response to similar efforts by conservative-led states in a nationwide battle for control of the US House of Representatives.The redistricting measure, called Prop 50, was aimed at reconfiguring the state's voting districts to give Democrats better chances at taking five seats in the US House of Representatives from Republicans during next year's midterm elections.Whether the measure will tip the balance of power in Washington remains unclear.Questions for national Democratic PartyMamdani's win in New York presents a dilemma for the Democratic establishment, which has been reluctant to endorse him. Mamdani was nonetheless favoured to win his race, having led his rivals in the polls by double digits for weeks leading up to election day. A relatively unknown figure just months ago, few could have predicted his journey from hip-hop artist and housing counsellor to the frontrunner candidate to lead a city with a $116bn (£88bn) budget and global scrutiny.The former New York assemblyman centred his campaign on cost-of-living issues in one of the country's most expensive cities, campaigning on issues like universal child care, and free and faster buses. His candidacy drew criticism from business leaders and centrist Democrats, some of whom did not endorse him, including fellow New Yorker and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Republicans have seized on Mamdani's popularity to paint the future of the Democratic Party as more and more left-leaning - a point that Trump has made during his threats to withhold federal funding to the New York City.",

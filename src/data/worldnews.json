    "body": "23 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentGetty ImagesJimmy Cliff's hits included Many Rivers To Cross, Wonderful World, Beautiful People and You Can Get It If You Really WantJimmy Cliff, one of the most prominent and beloved proponents of reggae music, has died at the age of 81.A star since the 1960s, he helped to bring the sound of Jamaica to a global audience through hits such as Wonderful World, Beautiful People and You Can Get It If You Really Want.His lead role as a gun-toting rebel in the 1972 crime drama The Harder They Come is a cornerstone of Jamaican cinema, and was attributed as the movie that brought reggae to America.Cliff's wife, Latifa Chambers, announced his death via a statement on Instagram.\"It's with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia,\" she wrote.\"I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists and coworkers who have shared his journey with him. \"To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career.\"Jimmy, my darling, may you rest in peace. I will follow your wishes.\" Her message was also signed by their children, Lilty and Aken.Getty ImagesBorn James Chambers in 1944, Cliff grew up as the eighth of nine children in abject poverty in the parish of St. James, Jamaica.Blessed with a sweet, mellifluous voice, he began singing at his local church at the age of six.He was inspired to write his own material when he heard ska pioneer Derrick Morgan on the radio - and asked his woodwork teacher how one might go about composing their own song. “He told me, ‘You just write it!’“ he told Mojo magazine. ”So I went ahead and… wrote a song called I Need A Fiancée, another called Sob Sob and I made a guitar out of bamboo to accompany myself.”By the time he was 14, he'd moved to Kingston and adopted the surname Cliff to express the heights he intended on reaching.He recorded a handful of singles before topping the Jamaican charts with his own composition, Hurricane Hattie. In 1965, he relocated to London to work with Island Records - later the home of Bob Marley - but the label's attempts to make his sound palatable to rock audiences were initially unsuccessful.He eventually struck gold with the 1969 single Wonderful World, Beautiful People - an upbeat, feelgood anthem; and the more politically-charged Vietnam, which Bob Dylan called \"the best protest song ever written\".Its lyric tells the story of a young soldier who writes from the war, promising his mother he'll be home soon; only for her to receive a telegram the next day, informing her of his death.Cliff reflected on the song in 1986, telling reggae archivist Roger Steffens: \"The essence of my music is struggle. What gives it the icing is the hope of love.\"Getty ImagesThe Harder They Come had to be subtitled in the US because of the character's thick Jamaican patoisThe musician became an international star with The Harder They Come, expressly written for the movie of the same name, in which he played Ivan Martin, a young man trying to break into Jamaica's corrupt music industry.\"The film opened the door for Jamaica,\" Cliff recalled. \"It said, 'This is where this music comes from.'\"BBC Sounds: Witness - Jimmy Cliff on The Harder They ComeBBC 6 Music: The First Time with Jimmy CliffCliff contributed four songs to the soundtrack, including the gospel hymn Many Rivers To Cross, which reflected his early days as a struggling artist in the UK.\"I was still in my teens,\" he later recalled. \"I came full of vigour: I'm going to make it, I'm going to be up there with the Beatles and the Stones.\"\"And it wasn't really going like that, I was touring clubs, not breaking through. I was struggling, with work, life, my identity. I couldn't find my place. Frustration fuelled the song.\"Instead, the film and its soundtrack won him international acclaim. Rolling Stone magazine even named it one of their top 500 albums of all time.During the 1980s, he collaborated with the Rolling Stones on their Dirty Work album, and he returned to the US charts in 1993 with his cover of I Can See Clearly Now, from the soundtrack for Cool Runnings, which followed the escapades of Jamaica's bobsled team.His other recordings included the Grammy Award-winning albums Cliff Hanger (1985) and Rebirth (2012), a nostalgic return to form.Cliff entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010, calling it \"a great thrill and an honour\".Inducting him, Fugees star Wyclef Jean said he'd been inspired by Cliff's success as a young boy growing up in Haiti.\"When we saw Jimmy Cliff, we saw ourselves,\" he said.Cliff continued to tour late into his life, playing Glastonbury's legends slot in 2003; and winning over a new generation of fans at the 2010 Coachella Festival.His contributions to Jamaican music and culture were recognised in October 2003 when he was awarded the country's prestigious Order of Merit.But the singer said his connection to fans was more important than any of the other honours bestowed upon him.Speaking to US radio station NPR in 2012, he reflected: \"When someone comes up to me and says, 'I was a dropout in school and I heard your song You Can Get It If You Really Want, and that song made me go back to school, and now I am a teacher and I use your song with my students' - that, for me, is a big success.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoJake KwonandLeehyun Choi,SeoulLee Soon-jae, one of South Korea's most beloved actors, died on Tuesday at the age of 91, his agency announced.In a career spanning more than 70 years across films, television and the stage, Lee was fondly known as the \"national TV dad\" for his many roles as a wise, older man. This included two of his best-known performances - as a strict father in the 1991 soap What on Earth is Love, and a silly but lovable grandpa in the popular sitcom High Kick! which aired from 2006 to 2012.News of his death has sparked an outpouring of tributes from young celebrities, including K-pop singers, speaking of his warmth and kindness, to President Lee Jae Myung.\"From theatre to film and television, he brought us laughter, emotion, comfort and courage,\" the president wrote on Facebook.Lee was acting until last year, when he won the grand prize at the KBS Drama Awards for his lead role in the comedy series, Dog Knows Everything. He was the oldest South Korean actor to ever win the honour. \"You become old when you sit down and expect to be waited on,\" he told fellow senior actors on the travel show Grandpas over Flowers. The 2013 show, which revolves around senior stars making strenuous journeys abroad, became a cultural phenomenon.Born in 1934 in Hoeryeong, a county now in North Korea, Lee was just four years old when his family moved south to Seoul.He was working in his grandparents' shop in the capital's Namdaemun market when Korea was liberated from Japanese rule in 1945.Lee studied philosophy at the prestigious Seoul National University but ventured into theatre and, eventually, TV and films. He said he was inspired to act after watching Sir Laurence Olivier play the title role in Hamlet.Lee appeared in some 140 TV shows through his career and continued to act on stage until October 2024, when he withdrew halfway through the run of the play Waiting for Godot because of an illness. He reappeared in public at the awards in December. He also had a brief foray into politics. In 1992, he was elected as a member of parliament for the conservative Democratic Liberal Party, but at the end of his four-year-term he did not run again. Lee's prolific career meant he has remained a household name for a decades, just as familiar to younger audiences and at a time when Korean entertainment is one of the country's biggest exports.His celebrity has even spilled onto the internet where scenes of him from High Kick! have resurfaced as memes on TikTok in recent years.Actor Yoo Yeon-seok, who studied under Lee, said he \"exemplified acting\"  and Lee Soon-jae's High Kick! co-star Jeong Bo-seok described Lee not just as a mentor in the industry, but a \"true mentor in my life\". He wrote on Instagram: \"Teacher, thank you so much for everything. I learned and felt so much from you - not only about acting, but also about life and the attitude of an actor.\" Additional reporting by Rachel Lee",

    "body": "18 hours agoCachella SmithandPatrick JacksonBelgium is bracing for widespread disruption across sectors including public transport and schools this week as unions hold a three-day national strike. The action was called in response to Prime Minister Bart De Wever's attempts to shrink Belgium's debt by changing labour laws and reforming unemployment benefits and pensions. Teachers, medical staff and rubbish collectors will all be joining the rolling industrial action which is set to end in a general strike on Wednesday.  Eurostar is among organisations warning of potential disruption, while the two main airports have advised customers that all departure flights will be cancelled on Wednesday.The country had already been hit by several strikes since de Wever, a Flemish nationalist, came to office in February at the head of a centre-right coalition government aiming to cut the budget deficit.  Early on Monday, his government reached a budget agreement which he said was the only way to \"guarantee the sustainability\" of Belgium's welfare state. The country's budget deficit stood at 4.5% of GDP at the end of last year with debt at 104.7% of GDP.EU budget rules stipulate that member states should keep their budget deficit below 3% and debt beneath 60% to maintain sound public finances.This week's industrial action is meant to unfold in three stages, AFP news agency notes: Trains and other public transport went on strike on Monday, with national railroad company SNCB expecting to run one or two out of three trains, and several Eurostar services linking Brussels to Paris cancelledOn Tuesday, public services such as schools, creches and hospitals join inOn Wednesday a full general strike covers all categories including the two main airports, Bruxelles-Zaventem and Charleroi.Warning of the effect of the strike action in Belgium, Eurostar reported that some of its other international services had suffered delays as a result.  Defending the action, general workers union FGTB said a demonstration in Brussels two weeks ago had been met with \"total silence\" from the government. Fair pensions is a core issue cited by the unions while other demands include a fair wealth tax, a tax on digital activities for tech giants and the transparent screening of subsidies to companies.A day of action against violence against women separately took place on Sunday which the FGTB said formed part of the current action.Bruxelles-Zaventem airport has said it expects \"major disruptions\" to operations on Wednesday with all departure flights cancelled and some cancellations also possible for incoming flights.The airport said that staff from their security and handling service provider were expected to be participating in the national industrial action.Charleroi airport has similarly said it will not be able to operate either scheduled departures or arrivals on the day of the general strike - as it also warned passengers of potential disruption on public service networks throughout the strike period.The City of Brussels has warned of \"disrupted services\" on its public transport links throughout the three days of action while transport company, De Lijn, which operates in Flanders has advised there will be \"fewer bus and tram services\".",

    "body": "The controversial, US and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) says it is winding down its aid operations in the Palestinian territory, after almost six months.The organisation had already suspended its three food distribution sites in Gaza after the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel took effect six weeks ago.The GHF aimed to bypass the UN as the main supplier of aid to Gaza's population. UN and other aid agencies refused to co-operate with its system, saying it was unethical and unsafe.Hundreds of Palestinians were killed while seeking food amid chaotic scenes near GHF's sites, mostly by Israeli fire, according to the UN. Israel said its troops fired warning shots.The GHF said on Monday that it was winding down operations now because of the \"successful completion of its emergency mission\", with a total of three million packages containing the equivalent of more than 187 million meals delivered to Palestinians.The GHF's executive director, Jon Acree, also said the US-led Civil-Military Coordination Centre (CMCC) - which has been set up to help implement US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan - would be \"adopting and expanding the model GHF piloted\".US state department spokesperson Tommy Piggott wrote on X: \"GHF's model, in which Hamas could no longer loot and profit from stealing aid, played a huge role in getting Hamas to the table and achieving a ceasefire.\"Hamas - which denies stealing aid - welcomed the closure of the GHF, Reuters reported.A Hamas spokesman said GHF should be held accountable for the harm it caused to Palestinians.\"We call upon all international human rights organisations to ensure that it does not escape accountability after causing the death and injury of thousands of Gazans and covering up the starvation policy practised by the (Israeli) government,\" Hazem Qassem wrote on his Telegram channel.The GHF began operations in Gaza on 26 May, a week after Israel had partially eased a total blockade on aid and commercial deliveries to Gaza that lasted 11 weeks and caused severe shortages of essential supplies. Three months later, a famine was declared in Gaza City.The GHF's food distribution sites in southern and central Gaza were operated by US private security contractors and located inside Israeli military zones.The UN and its partners said the system contravened the fundamental humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence, and that channelling desperate people into militarised zones was inherently unsafe.The UN's human rights office said it recorded the killing of at least 859 Palestinians seeking food in the vicinity of GHF sites between 26 May and 31 July. Another 514 people were killed near the routes of UN and other aid convoys, it added. Most of them were killed by the Israeli military, according to the office.The Israeli military said its troops had fired warning shots at people who approached them in a \"threatening\" manner.The GHF said there were no shootings at the aid sites and accused the UN of using \"false and misleading\" statistics from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.The GHF's future had been uncertain since Hamas and Israel agreed a ceasefire deal to implement the first phase of Trump's peace plan.It said aid distribution would take place \"without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner\" with Hamas and Israel.UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Monday that the GHF's shutdown would have \"no impact\" on its operations \"because we never worked with them\".He also said that while more aid was getting into Gaza since the ceasefire took effect on 10 October, it was \"not enough to meet all the needs\" of the 2.1 million population.",

    "body": "Illinois police captured Morgan Geyser, who was convicted in the 2014 stabbing of a classmate to appease Slender Man, an online character, after she fled a group home in neighbouring Wisconsin where she was being held.Police said Geyser, 23, removed her bracelet monitoring device and fled the home in Madison on Saturday night and was on the run until her capture on Sunday.Officers found her at a truck stop in Posen, Illinois, where they said Geyser told them to \"just Google\" her name and that she had \"done something really bad\".Geyser was 12 years old when she stabbed her classmate 19 times. She was sentenced to 40 years in a mental hospital in 2018 and granted conditional release in July.Geyser was found with a man at the truck stop just outside of Chicago - and about 170 miles south of Madison - after police received reports of a man and woman loitering.\"When officers arrived, they located both subjects sleeping on the sidewalk,\" Posen police said in a statement. \"The female repeatedly refused to provide her real name and initially gave a false one. \"After continued attempts to identify her, she finally stated that she didn't want to tell officers who she was because she had 'done something really bad,' and suggested that officers could 'just Google' her name.\"She and her companion were detained after police determined she was wanted in Wisconsin. CBS News, the BBC's US partner, reported the 42-year-old companion was charged with trespassing and obstructing identification and later released. The so-called \"Slender Man stabbing\" shocked Wisconsin and garnered national attention. Geyser and her friend Anissa Weier, also 12 at the time of the attack, lured a classmate to a park after a sleepover and Geyser stabbed the classmate repeatedly while Weier encouraged her to continue. The victim, 12-year-old Payton Leutner, survived the brutal attack and was found by a cyclist. Geyser and Weier were tried as adults. Geyser pleaded guilty to first-degree intentional homicide and was sentenced to 40 years. A judge allowed her release under supervision at the group home in July.Weier was charged with attempted murder and sentenced to 25 years in a psychiatric hospital but released in 2021.Geyser and Weier said they were inspired to attack their classmate after reading about Slender Man in a creepypasta, a short, online story designed to shock or scare the reader. Slender Man is a skinny, shadowy figure who has appeared in photos, drawings and articles across the internet. Some claim he has tentacles emerging from his back, and most say he wears dark clothes and has a pale face.The girls said they believed Slender Man would kill their relatives if they did not kill their friend to please him, an attorney for Geyser said in court. Authorities said the girls had hoped to live with Slender Man after the attack.Slender Man first appeared on the internet in 2009.The character was created by a Florida resident in response to a call for submissions from comedy website SomethingAwful. The character was pictured behind a crowd of people.After the stabbing, the website released an article urging people not to kill anyone because of Slender Man.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump has said he agreed to visit Beijing in April and invited Chinese President Xi Jinping for a state visit later next year, following a phone call between the two leaders.Trump and Xi - who met nearly a month ago in South Korea - discussed a range of issues including trade, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, fentanyl and Taiwan, according to the president and China's foreign ministry.\"Our relationship with China is extremely strong!\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.China's state new agency released a statement that said both countries should \"keep up the momentum, keep moving forward in the right direction on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit\". The leaders met in Busan, South Korea in October, after which they agreed to a truce on tariffs. The US decided to cut a 20% tariff in half aimed at decreasing the flow of fentanyl. Tariffs remain on Chinese goods and average just below 50%. \"Since then, the China-US relationship has generally maintained a steady and positive trajectory, and this is welcomed by the two countries and the broader international community,\" the Chinese statement said.Xi and Trump find temporary truce as China plays longer gameTrade, tariffs and TikTok: Why it matters that Trump and Xi are talking againThe US then pulled back a threat of 100% additional tariffs on Chinese goods, while China delayed its plan to introduce its latest round of rare earth export controls. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Monday call with Xi - which lasted about an hour - was focused on trade.\"We are pleased with what we've seen from from the Chinese, and they feel the same way,\" she said.In addition to discussing trade, Xi and Trump broached the topics of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Taiwan.Xi told Trump that Taiwan's \"return to China\" is essential for China's vision for the \"post-war international order\".China has been marred in a diplomatic battle with Japan, a US ally, over the longstanding \"strategic ambiguity\" on the sovereignty of self-governed Taiwan.Earlier this month, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said any Chinese attack on Taiwan could force a Japanese military response.Trump, however, did not mention Taiwan in his Truth Social post about the call. US Ambassador to Japan, George Glass, previously said the US backs Tokyo in the wake of China's \"coercion\".",

    "body": "Judge dismisses cases against ex-FBI director Comey and NY attorney general James15 hours agoAna FaguyComey: \"Donald Trump will probably come after me again\"A US judge has dismissed criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, ruling that the prosecutor who brought the charges was unlawfully appointed.Judge Cameron Currie said that Lindsey Halligan, who was handpicked by Trump to bring the charges against two of his political adversaries, was never eligible to assume the post.Both Comey and James have maintained their innocence and described the prosecutions as political in nature. In response to the ruling, the White House told the BBC:  \"The facts of the indictments against Comey and James have not changed and this will not be the final word on this matter.\"President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked Comey and James, declaring in one social media post, \"They're all guilty as hell\", and later adding \"JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\" In her decision on Monday, Judge Currie wrote that Halligan, a former White House aide who had never prosecuted a case before, was not authorised to present the charges to the grand jury.\"All actions flowing from Ms Halligan's defective appointment, including securing and signing Mr Comey's indictment, were unlawful exercises of executive power and are hereby set aside,\" Currie ruled.Getty ImagesLindsey HalliganHalligan was named as a replacement for Erik Siebert, an interim US attorney who resigned in September amid the Trump administration's pressure to file charges against both Comey and James.Judge Currie determined that Halligan's appointment violated the statute governing interim US attorneys. Under that law, the attorney general has 120 days to make an interim appointment - a period that began on 21 January with Siebert's designation, the judge noted.When that 120-day window closed on 21 May, the attorney general's authority to appoint an interim replacement expired as well, Judge Currie wrote. As a result, Halligan \"has been unlawfully serving in that role\" since her 22 September appointment.The cases were dismissed \"without prejudice\", meaning the justice department could potentially refile the case at a later date.The department did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the justice department would appeal against the dismissal of Comey and James's cases \"very soon\".She said the administration's position was that Halligan had been legally appointed. Leavitt also accused the judge of \"trying to shield\"  Comey and James.Getty ImagesLetitia JamesAfter the ruling, Comey said he was grateful a prosecution \"based on malevolence and incompetence\" had ended, but noted \"Trump will probably come after me again\".Comey was fired by Trump during his first term, after leading an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. The former FBI director was charged with making false statements and obstruction of justice in September, after Trump called for his prosecution and appointed a new federal prosecutor to pursue the case. James issued a statement saying she was \"heartened by today's victory\".\"I remain fearless in the face of these baseless charges as I continue fighting for New Yorkers every single day,\" the statement continued.James was facing federal charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. She previously brought charges against Trump before he won re-election, and later became a target of the Trump administration.

    "body": "Tanzania has cancelled next month's independence day celebrations, with the funds to be instead spent on rebuilding infrastructure damaged in recent election unrest, Prime Minister Mwigulu Nchemba has said.His announcement comes as the opposition and others have been calling for people to gather on independence day - 9 December - to demonstrate about killings that took place following last month's disputed poll.The opposition believes hundreds of people died in the crackdown. The government has yet to give a death toll and has set up commission of inquiry.President Samia Suluhu Hassan won the poll with 98% of the vote, described by the opposition as a \"mockery of democracy\".Her key opponents were unable to contest the poll: Tundu Lissu has been in detention on treason charges, which he denies, while Luhaga Mpina's candidacy was rejected on technical grounds. Election observers have since reported signs that the vote was manipulated and fell short of democratic standards. The government had imposed an internet blackout for five days from the 29 October election day and threatened anyone sharing photos from the protests.Gruesome images and videos of dead Tanzanians have since been widely shared online, with international media verifying some of the graphic footage as authentic. However, the government has criticised their portrayal as aimed at tarnishing the country's image, insisting the country is safe.On Sunday, the government spokesman Gerson Msigwa said the commission of inquiry would shed light into what happened. However, groups have raised concern over the independence of the commission.At least 240 people were charged with treason after the protests, but the president later sought to ease tension and asked prosecutors to \"show leniency\". Many of those charged have reportedly already been released.On Monday, while announcing the cancellation of celebrations, Nchemba appealed to Tanzanians to avoid violence and insisted on the importance of political dialogue.\"I urge my fellow Tanzanians to come together and discuss the issues affecting us. Let us not return to what we went through, because the consequences are irreparable,\" he said.President Samia came into office in 2021 as Tanzania's first female president following the death of President John Magufuli.She was initially praised for easing political repression, but the political space has since narrowed.",

    "body": "UK's Indo-Pacific Minister Seema Malhotra has defended her government's immigration proposals during a visit to India, while expressing concern about a rise in foreign students seeking asylum at the end of their studies.Under the new plans, some migrants could have to wait up to 20 years before they can settle permanently in the UK and the qualifying period for indefinite leave to remain will be extended from five to 10 years.The proposals will apply to an estimated 2.6 million people who arrived in the country since 2021. They have drawn criticism from some quarters, including a few Labour MPs, even though the Conservatives gave the measures a cautious welcome.The reforms are \"in line with what countries around the world do\" to stop the abuse of their immigration systems, Malhotra told the BBC in the southern Indian city of Chennai, adding that there was a \"very strong message we also send, which is that we welcome those coming legally\".According to Malhotra some16,000 international students from across the world had applied for asylum in the UK last year after completing their courses, which she said was evidence of abuse of legal migration routes.A further 14,800 students sought asylum this year to June 2025, latest Home Office figures show. It is unclear how many of them are Indian nationals.\"We've seen visa abuse in the case of legal routes, where people have gone legally and then sought to overstay when their visas weren't extended,\" Malhotra said.\"If you see that level of abuse, it undermines your immigration system. It undermines public confidence, and the fairness and control people expect.\"India remains one of the UK's biggest sources of international students, but demand is cooling. The number of Indian students heading to the UK has fallen 11% from last year as tougher immigration rules kick in. This has triggered concern among UK universities which rely on foreign students and are already under financial strain.According to the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, India was the top country of origin for foreign students in the UK in 2023-2024, making up 25% of arrivals. China followed at 23% while Nigeria made up 8%.Malhotra said while Britain still \"very much welcomes\" Indian students, her government was working with universities to ensure they are genuine foreign students. She said the recently concluded free trade agreement (FTA) between the UK and India had also encouraged UK universities to open local campuses in India, with Liverpool University announcing it will open a campus in Bengaluru city in 2026 last week.The FTA, signed in July after years of negotiations, is forecast to boost the UK's GDP by £4.8bn annually and expand bilateral trade between the two countries by £25.5bn.As part of the education chapter in the deal, nine UK universities have been cleared to set up campuses across India.However, these wider trade ambitions face a domestic political climate that has hardened around migration. During a visit to India in October, Sir Keir Starmer said the UK would not relax visa rules for Indian nationals despite Delhi's long-standing push for easier mobility in return for trade concessions.Malhotra rejected the idea that Britain wants deeper trade while shutting the door to Indian professionals, citing the nearly half-a-million visas granted to Indian nationals last year across work, study and visitor categories.The UK is moving towards a \"contribution-based\" immigration system, where settlement and long-term stay depend on a person's economic contribution rather than the length of time they have lived in the country, Malhotra said.The government's proposal to overhaul the UK's immigration system is part of a broader attempt to show firmer control over borders, but has drawn criticism from some Labour MPs and members of the House of Lords, particularly over their potential impact on international recruitment in sectors like healthcare and social care.While the reforms are still under consultation, Malhotra, when asked about settlement routes for migrant professionals like nurses and care workers said, \"we are expanding routes for those with skills in areas that the UK requires\". A survey by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) had warned that up to 50,000 nurses could leave the UK if the government went ahead with its immigration proposals.The report notes that the UK now has more than 200,000 internationally educated nursing staff, making up around 25% of the country's total nursing workforce of 794,000.A significant number of these nurses and care workers are from India. Several investigations, including by the BBC, have shown that many of them have fallen prey to cross-border visa scams and lost hundreds of thousands of pounds.But Malhotra said the UK was ramping up efforts to protect people from such exploitation and working with law enforcement agencies of countries like India to share intelligence and crack down on such gangs.

    "body": "Just nowHafsa KhalilandYang TianWatch: Explosions rock Kyiv after overnight Russian strikesUkraine's security chief says he is hoping to arrange for President Volodymyr Zelensky to visit the US \"at the earliest suitable date\" this month, as diplomatic attempts to end the war continue. A US official has told the BBC that Ukraine has \"agreed to a peace deal\", adding there are still \"some minor details to be sorted out\". Kyiv has not commented, and the White House has not confirmed the prospect of any Trump-Zelensky talks.Meanwhile, the US has confirmed its officials are set to meet Russian representatives in Abu Dhabi. But the fighting has continued, with Russia and Ukraine trading overnight air attacks.Officials in Kyiv said at least six people had been killed in Russian strikes on the city, while Russian officials said at least three had been killed in a Ukrainian strike in the Rostov region.Ukraine's national security chief Rustem Umerov said his team \"look forward\" to organising Zelensky's US visit \"at the earliest suitable date in November to complete final steps and make a deal\" with US President Donald Trump.In a social media post on Tuesday, he wrote that US and Ukrainian delegations has reached \"a common understanding on the core terms\" of the peace plan, referring to their meeting in Geneva on Sunday.Leaders in Kyiv and Europe had criticised the initial draft, which they said was too favourable to Russia. Counter-proposals - reportedly drafted by the UK, France and Germany - excluded any recognition of Russian-held regions, raised Ukraine's permitted army size, and left the door open to Ukraine joining Nato. Zelensky welcomed the proposed changes to the controversial 28-point US peace plan.\"Now the list of necessary steps to end the war can become doable,\" Zelensky said. \"Many correct elements have been incorporated into this framework.\"A Kremlin official rejected the amendments as \"completely unconstructive\". However, a US official on Tuesday told the BBC that its team would be meeting Russian representatives in Abu Dhabi to further discuss the plan.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov – who is not attending the meeting – said the Kremlin has yet to receive the \"interim\" version of the revised plan, adding that Moscow's view was that it should reflect the \"spirit and letter\" of the Alaska talks between Trump and President Vladimir Putin in August.Separately, a virtual \"coalition of the willing\" meeting of Ukraine's European allies will also be taking place on Tuesday to discuss developments, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said.EPAResidents of apartment buildings were forced to evacuate in Kyiv after being hit by strikesThe latest round of talks come as Russia and Ukraine exchanged overnight strikes.Kyiv's military administration chief, Tymur Tkachenko, said a fire had broken out at a high-rise residential apartment building in the Dniprovskyi district, forcing the evacuation of its residents. Emergency services on the scene said 18 people had been rescued, including three children, and the search for victims was ongoing after the fire had been contained.Residents of a high-rise apartment in the city's central Pechersk district were also evacuated after it was set ablaze during the strikes according to Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko. He added that the building suffered damage to the upper floors, but the fire had been extinguished.Ukraine's air defence units responded to the attack as explosions were heard across Kyiv and residents were urged to take shelter in underground car parks and bunkers.Ukraine's Ministry of Energy also confirmed a \"massive, combined enemy attack\" on the country's energy infrastructure facilities.According to Zelensky, 22 missiles and more than 460 drones were launched at Ukraine overnight.Nato scrambled four planes over Romania - the third time in four days its planes have been sent to intercept drones in Ukraine's border region. Six Russian drones were also detected in Moldova.Meanwhile, the Russian defence ministry said it had intercepted 249 Ukrainian drones overnight, including over the Black Sea and Kursk.In Russia's Rostov region, the death toll from a Ukrainian strike had risen to three, after initial reports of one death, officials said.According to Russia's acting governor of the Rostov region Yuri Sliusar, two died in hospital.One of the deaths was reported in the city of Taganrog, where mayor Svetlana Kambulova vowed \"necessary response measures\".Another 10 people were injured in the strikes.In the southern Krasnodar region, Governor Veniamin Kondratyev described Ukraine's overnight bombardment \"one of the Kyiv regime's most sustained and massive attacks\".The proposed peace plan - drafted by US and Russian officials last month - had caused much consternation in Ukraine and among its European allies, who said it was too favourable to the Kremlin.But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected the idea that the Trump administration was \"not engaging with both sides equally in this war\".After talks in Geneva between the US and Ukraine concluded, Trump suggested that \"something good just may be happening\" but added: \"Don't believe it until you see it.\"As he welcomed the proposed changes, Zelensky said the \"main problem\" was Putin's demand for legal recognition of the territory Russia had taken.Russia has consistently demanded full Ukrainian withdrawal from the whole of the eastern Donbas, made up of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Moscow' forces also control Crimea and large parts of two other regions, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.The European Union's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the final peace plan should make it impossible for Moscow to invade again, and that Russia should \"definitely not\" rejoin the G8.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday, she said: \"We can't go back to business as usual... how could you imagine that?\"Tens of thousands of soldiers and thousands of civilians have been killed or injured, and millions of people have fled their homes, since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022.",

    "body": "Music eases surgery and speeds recovery, Indian study finds12 hours agoSoutik BiswasIndia correspondentBBCA patient with headphones playing music during surgery in a hospital in DelhiUnder the harsh lights of an operating theatre in the Indian capital, Delhi, a woman lies motionless as surgeons prepare to remove her gallbladder.She is under general anaesthesia: unconscious, insensate and rendered completely still by a blend of drugs that induce deep sleep, block memory, blunt pain and temporarily paralyse her muscles.Yet, amid the hum of monitors and the steady rhythm of the surgical team, a gentle stream of flute music plays through the headphones placed over her ears.Even as the drugs silence much of her brain, its auditory pathway remains partly active. When she wakes up, she will regain consciousness more quickly and clearly because she required lower doses of anaesthetic drugs such as propofol and opioid painkillers than patients who heard no music.That, at least, is what a new peer-reviewed study from Delhi's Maulana Azad Medical College and Lok Nayak Hospital suggests. The research, published in the journal Music and Medicine, offers some of the strongest evidence yet that music played during general anaesthesia can modestly but meaningfully reduce drug requirements and improve recovery.The study focuses on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the standard keyhole operation to remove the gallbladder. The procedure is short - usually under an hour - and demands a particularly swift, \"clear-headed\" recovery.To understand why the researchers turned to music, it helps to decode the modern practice of anaesthesia.\"Our aim is early discharge after surgery,\" says Dr Farah Husain, senior specialist in anaesthesia and certified music therapist for the study. \"Patients need to wake up clear-headed, alert and oriented, and ideally pain-free. With better pain management, the stress response is curtailed.\" Achieving that requires a carefully balanced mix of five or six drugs that together keep the patient asleep, block pain, prevent memory of the surgery and relax the muscles.Getty ImagesPatients need to wake up clear-headed and ideally pain-free after surgeryIn procedures like laparoscopic gallbladder removal, anaesthesiologists now often supplement this drug regimen with regional \"blocks\" - ultrasound-guided injections that numb nerves in the abdominal wall. \"General anaesthesia plus blocks is the norm,\" says Dr Tanvi Goel, primary investigator and a former senior resident of Maulana Azad Medical College. \"We've been doing this for decades.\"But the body does not take to surgery easily. Even under anaesthesia, it reacts: heart rate rises, hormones surge, blood pressure spikes. Reducing and managing this cascade is one of the central goals of modern surgical care. Dr Husain explains that the stress response can slow recovery and worsen inflammation, highlighting why careful management is so important.The stress starts even before the first cut, with intubation - the insertion of a breathing tube into the windpipe.To do this, the anaesthesiologist uses a laryngoscope to lift the tongue and soft tissues at the base of the throat, obtain a clear view of the vocal cords, and guide the tube into the trachea. It's a routine step in general anaesthesia that keeps the airway open and allows precise control of the patient's breathing while they are unconscious.\"The laryngoscopy and intubation are considered the most stressful response during general anaesthesia,\" says Dr Sonia Wadhawan, director-professor of anaesthesia and intensive care at Maulana Azad Medical College and supervisor of the study.\"Although the patient is unconscious and will remember nothing, their body still reacts to the stress with changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones.\"To be sure, the drugs have evolved. The old ether masks have vanished. In their place are intravenous agents - most notably propofol, the hypnotic made infamous by Michael Jackson's death but prized in operating theatres for its rapid onset and clean recovery. \"Propofol acts within about 12 seconds,\" notes Dr Goel. \"We prefer it for short surgeries like laparoscopic cholecystectomy because it avoids the 'hangover' caused by inhalational gases.\"The team of researchers wanted to know whether music could reduce how much propofol and fentanyl (an opioid painkiller) patients required. Less drugs means faster awakening, steadier vital signs and reduced side effects.So they designed a study. A pilot involving eight patients led to a full 11-month trial of 56 adults, aged roughly 20 to 45, randomly assigned to two groups. All received the same five-drug regimen: a drug that prevents nausea and vomiting, a sedative, fentanyl, propofol and a muscle relaxant. Both groups wore noise-cancelling headphones - but only one heard music.\"We asked patients to select from two calming instrumental pieces - soft flute or piano,\" says Dr Husain. \"The unconscious mind still has areas that remain active. Even if the music isn't explicitly recalled, implicit awareness can lead to beneficial effects.\"A pilot involving eight patients led to a full trial of 56 adults randomly assigned to two groups The results were striking.Patients exposed to music required lower doses of propofol and fentanyl. They experienced smoother recoveries, lower cortisol or stress-hormone levels and a much better control of blood pressure during the surgery. \"Since the ability to hear remains intact under anaesthesia,\" the researchers write, \"music can still shape the brain's internal state.\"Clearly, music seemed to quieten the internal storm. \"The auditory pathway remains active even when you're unconscious,\" says Dr Wadhawan. \"You may not remember the music, but the brain registers it.\"The idea that the mind behind the anaesthetic veil is not entirely silent has long intrigued scientists. Rare cases of \"intraoperative awareness\" show patients recalling fragments of operating-room conversation. If the brain is capable of picking up and remembering stressful experiences during surgery - even when a patient is unconscious - then it might also be able to register positive or comforting experiences, like music, even without conscious memory.\"We're only beginning to explore how the unconscious mind responds to non-pharmacological interventions like music,\" says Dr Husain. \"It's a way of humanising the operating room.\"Music therapy is not new to medicine; it has long been used in psychiatry, stroke rehabilitation and palliative care. But its entry into the intensely technical, machine-governed world of anaesthesia marks a quiet shift.If such a simple intervention can reduce drug use and speed recovery - even modestly - it could reshape how hospitals think about surgical wellbeing.As the research team prepares its next study exploring music-aided sedation, building on earlier findings, one truth is already humming through the data: even when the body is still and the mind asleep, it appears a few gentle notes can help the healing begin.",

    "body": "2 days agoJane ChambersBusiness reporter, Aguas Calientes, PeruAFP via Getty ImagesMachu Picchu attracts more than 1.6 million tourists per year, but getting there is not easyMachu Picchu, the remains of a 15th Century Inca city, is Peru's most popular tourist destination, and a Unesco world heritage site. Yet a continuing dispute over the buses that take visitors up to the mountain-top site recently saw some 1,400 stranded tourists needing to be evacuated.Cristian Alberto Caballero Chacón is head of operations for bus company Consettur, which for the past 30 years has transported some 4,500 people every day to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas Calientes.It is a 20-minute journey, and the only alternative is an arduous, steep, two-hour walk.He admits that in the past few months \"there have been some conflicts between people from different communities here\".This conflict revolves around Consettur losing its licence to a rival bus firm in this remote part of Peru, where, unless you want to hike over Andes mountains, the only access is by public transport.To get to Machu Picchu without walking, tourists must first take a train to Aguas Calientes, which takes from two to three and a half hours. And then transfer to a bus for the final leg.Wilson ChiloA fleet of buses ferry tourists to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas CalientesBack in September, local protestors angry that Consettur was being replaced following what they saw as an insufficiently open bidding process, blocked the railway line to Aguas Calientes with rocks.This resulted in Peruvian authorities having to clear the tracks and evacuate tourists on special train services.A number of local people, who didn't want to go on the record, say the protestors were unhappy that Consettur had a monopoly on the lucrative bus service, and that its position as sole provider was simply due to be transferred to new company San Antonio de Torontoy. A round-trip bus ticket costs $24 (£18) for a foreigner and $15 for a Peruvian.Although Consettur's licence ran out in September, it is continuing to run its buses. And due to legal challenges, San Antonio de Torontoy has yet to start.It's a complex situation, involving people from different local communities wanting a slice of the bus income, but Mr Caballero is adamant that Consettur is not a monopoly.\"The owners of the business have been running the company for the past 30 years, and they are people who come from around here,\" he says. \"This is not a monopoly. Consettur is made up of 12 different companies with various partners.\"These partners include the local district council, which owns 38% of Consettur.Meanwhile, San Antonio de Torontoy is based slightly further away in the wider Urubamba Province.AFP via Getty ImagesUnless you fancy a long hike, the only way to get to the town of Aguas Calientes is by trainAs the row and legal dispute over the buses rumbles on, Australian tourist Annalise Jaksic complains about the cost of the trains to Aguas Calientes. The cheapest round-trip ticket is $140, rising to $2,000 for luxury first class.Speaking in Aguas Calientes, she says: \"We thought it was one train [all the way to Machu Picchu]. And we thought if there was any more transport to get up there it would all be included, because you pay so much money for the train.\"Her friend and travelling companion Todd Carland adds that buying the entry tickets for the site \"was a nightmare for us\". He says it was difficult to arrange because they weren't doing it through an expensive guided tour. A standard adult price for Machu Picchu is $57.The mayor of Aguas Calientes, Elvis La Torre, is also unhappy about the entry tickets, because he says that most of the revenues do not stay locally.\"Only 10% of the ticket sales stay in the region. The rest of the money goes to the Ministry of Culture to look after other archaeological sites around Peru and pay for wages.\"He wants more money to go to his community and the surrounding region to help improve tourism and fund more projects to help the locals. The Ministry of Culture was asked for a comment.Wilson ChiloCristian Alberto Caballero Chacón says Consettur would welcome the competitionOutside on one of the side streets that are full of stalls offering tourism souvenirs, like fluffy alpacas and scarves, Dina Huillca is sitting on the pavement selling roses, tomatoes and mint. She travels from her village to get here, and says that \"more needs to be done for the local communities\".She adds: \"We don't have basic services like running water, or a hospital, and the schools need to be in better condition.\"Carlos González is president of the chamber of tourism for this region of Peru, the Department of Cusco. He wants to see more state oversight of public transport in Peru.\"We are pushing for an update in the law so that the vice ministry of tourism can take care of all the travel resources in our country,\" he says. \"If we don't have a unified approach to Peru as a destination we can't be competitive in the long term.\"He also wants to change tourists' experiences in Machu Picchu, with more entrances, and separate areas where different types of visitors can gather.\"[Such as] spiritual travellers going and having meditative rituals in one area,\" says Mr Gonzalez. \"And let's not forget the younger crowd who are more inclined to do their Tik Toks and their stories for Instagram. They also need a place for doing that and enjoying themselves in a young fashion.\"But he says that Peru's unstable national governments make change difficult. The country has had six different presidents in the past six years.\"I've been a leader of the tourism sector for five years now, and I have lost count of how many ministers, vice ministers and congress people I have spoken to.\"Back in Aguas Calientes, Mr Caballero says he'd be happy to see both Consettur and San Antonio de Toronto run buses to and from Machu Picchu.\"If they are given the final approval we don't have a problem with working with them. We won't stop them.\"Read more global business and tech stories",

    "body": "17 hours agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent , Geneva Donald Trump wants a peace deal in Ukraine very badly.Kyiv wants peace even more, just not at any cost.That's why when the US began pushing it to agree to a deal by Thanksgiving on what looked close to surrender terms, Ukraine pushed back.It scrambled senior officials to talks in Geneva and all of Sunday we saw delegates from the US and Ukraine shuttling back and forth between the two main venues in black limousines with darkened windows.They were joined by national security advisers from Germany, France and the UK.The only time I glimpsed Andriy Yermak, heading the negotiating team from Kyiv, he looked stony-faced.No wonder: the starting proposal on the table was so skewed towards Russia's demands, the talks began with the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio having to deny it had been written by the Kremlin.But Donald Trump had been clear that Ukraine needed to sign up fast or face unspecified consequences. So Kyiv had to engage.On Sunday night, Marco Rubio declared there'd been \"tremendous progress\" in the talks with just a \"couple of things\" still outstanding. When pressed, he wouldn't be more specific, calling the situation \"delicate\".But a joint Ukraine-US statement says there's now a whole new deal in play, which it calls an \"updated and revised framework document\".We haven't seen that yet. The Financial Times newspaper quotes one of the delegates, though - Ukraine's deputy foreign minister Sergiy Kyslytsya - who talks of a new 19-point plan with \"very little left\" from the original draft.That new document likely incorporates at least some of the amendments proposed by the Europeans and published by Reuters news agency that point to something far more palatable for Kyiv.In that version, an automatic veto on future Ukrainian Nato membership is gone - as well as a cap on troop numbers for the country's armed forces.It says no Western troops would be deployed to Ukraine permanently, but that's not an all-out ban.On the sensitive question of territory – land Ukrainian soldiers have been fighting and dying to defend for 11 years – there would be no handover of the rest of the Donbas region to Russia for free, and Ukraine would aim to recover occupied areas through exclusively diplomatic means. That's something Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously accepted. The full amnesty for war crimes is deleted, too.But most critically, there's reference to security guarantees.Several officials, including the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, have talked about Ukraine getting Article 5-style protection, meaning the US would be bound to come to its defence if Russia ever invaded again.That's the key issue which Ukraine says it can't negotiate on.We don't know how many of these European ideas have made it into the new proposal, but Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz calls the deal \"significantly modified\" – in a positive sense.So how did we get from a pro-Russian deal to this in just a day? It's hard to be sure, with US hawks like President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff in the room.The initial Kremlin-friendly plan was rooted in Witkoff's own visit to Russian President Vladimir Putin this spring, when he returned quoting Russia's controversial narratives almost verbatim.Instead, this plan seems like something Ukraine might sign up to – eventually.Which must be why Trump has gone from berating officials in Kyiv, again, for supposedly showing him \"zero gratitude\", to proclaiming that \"something good\" may be coming.But how good? There is still no sign that Russia is ready to give up fighting unless it's forced to.\"Putin is much more self-confident militarily, right now,\" Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center believes.She points to a corruption scandal and political crisis in Kyiv, problems mobilising soldiers there, and military gains for Russian forces on the ground – all driving Putin's thinking.At best, some suggest Trump's demand for a deal has injected new momentum into efforts to find peace, which Ukrainians, under fire, desperately want.But it's hard to escape the sense that these days of frantic diplomacy have only brought us back to where we started\"Russia's position is, 'we have laid out our demands, so do you take them or not?' Stanovaya said. \"'If so, we will stop the war – if not, we'll just wait until you're ready.'\"",

    "body": "Zelensky welcomes amendments to proposed peace plan11 hours agoLaura GozziandPatrick JacksonRubio hails 'most productive day' of negotiations with UkraineUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has welcomed proposed changes to the controversial 28-point peace plan for ending the war with Russia.  It appears Ukraine's European allies produced an amended version of the plan after rejecting parts which favoured Russia's war aims.\"Now the list of necessary steps to end the war can become doable...\" Zelensky said on Telegram. \"Many correct elements have been incorporated into this framework.\" Later, in the early hours of Tuesday, Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko said a wave of Russian missile and drone attacks hit an apartment building in the capital and disrupted electricity and water supplies.Ukraine's Ministry of Energy also confirmed a \"massive, combined enemy attack\" on the country's energy infrastructure facilities.\"Energy officials will begin assessing the consequences and restoration work as soon as the security situation permits,\" it said in a statement.US and Ukrainian officials met in Geneva on Sunday to discuss the plan, drafted by American and Russian officials in October, which had caused consternation in Kyiv and among its European allies. Russian representatives did not take part in the meeting in Switzerland. A Kremlin official rejected the amendments on Monday as \"completely unconstructive\". In another development, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that the Trump administration was not favouring Russia in its efforts to end the war.\"The idea that the United States of America is not engaging with both sides equally in this war to bring it to an end is a complete and total fallacy,\" she told reporters.President Donald Trump was \"hopeful and optimistic\" that a plan could be worked out for ending the war, Leavitt added.Following the end of the talks in Geneva, Trump suggested on social media that \"something good just may be happening\" but added: \"Don't believe it until you see it.\"In Geneva, the talks began with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio having to deny the 28-point plan advocated by Trump had been written by the Kremlin, as several of its elements seemed heavily geared towards Moscow's longstanding demands.Zelensky said on Monday evening that the revised plan was \"truly the right approach\". \"The sensitive issues, the most delicate points, I will discuss with President Trump,\" he added, without saying when.According to an official in Zelensky's office, the 28-point plan leaked on Friday no longer existed. Speaking to the Financial Times, Ukraine's First Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergiy Kyslytsa, who attended the weekend talks in Geneva, said the latest plan consisted of just 19 points, with some of the most politically sensitive elements, including territorial concessions, now due to be decided by the leaders themselves.A virtual \"coalition of the willing\" meeting of Ukraine's European allies will take place on Tuesday to discuss developments, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced.There was, he said, still work to do for a \"just and lasting peace\" in Ukraine.In Moscow, Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters: \"The European plan, at first glance... is completely unconstructive and does not work for us.\"Zelensky said earlier on Monday that the \"main problem\" remained Putin's demand for legal recognition of territory Russia had taken.Comments by Trump which suggested Ukraine had until 27 November to accept the deal or risk losing US support created a sense of urgency across Europe on Friday, and talks between Ukraine and US officials were hastily convened.The counter-proposals - reportedly drafted by the UK, France and Germany - excluded any recognition of Russian-held regions, raised Ukraine's permitted army size, and left the door open to Ukraine joining Nato. Russia has consistently demanded full Ukrainian withdrawal from the whole of the eastern Donbas, made up of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. It also controls Crimea and large parts of two other regions, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.  Tens of thousands of soldiers and thousands of civilians have been killed or injured, and millions of people have fled their homes, since Russia's full-scale invasion began nearly four years ago.",

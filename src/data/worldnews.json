    "body": "A bus driver has died after being hit when a coach carrying supporters of an Italian basketball team was attacked with stones, allegedly by rival fans.Pistoia Basket fans were travelling on the highway near the town of Rieti, 80km (50 miles) north-east of Rome, when fans of SRS Sebastiani Rieti began throwing objects, according to local media.Fans of the Tuscany-based Pistoia had been returning from a game between the two second-tier sides, which their team had won.A large stone smashed through the windscreen and struck one of the two drivers on the head. Raffaele Marianella, 65, was sitting at the front but not driving at the time of the attack. He later died of his injuries.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the attack was \"an unacceptable and insane act of violence\". She expressed her condolences to the victim's family and said those responsible would be brought to justice.A police investigation is under way to track down the perpetrators.Italy's Sports Minister Andrea Abodi described the attack as a \"shocking assault\" carried out by \"criminals who have turned into murderers and can never be called fans\". \"This is not about basketball. These are criminals,\" said Gianni Petrucci, president of Federbasket, Italy's national basketball federation. He said he would work with the legal authorities on a response to the attack.\"They are murderers, people with no present and no future,\" he told national broadcaster RAI.",

    "body": "2 hours agoNatalie ShermanBBC NewsAFP via Getty ImagesThe US and Australia have signed a deal intended to boost supplies of rare earths and other critical minerals, as the Trump administration looks for ways to counter China's dominance of the market. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the deal would support a pipeline of $8.5bn (Â£6.3bn) \"ready-to-go\" projects that would expand his country's mining and processing abilities. It includes $1bn to be invested by the two countries in projects in the US and Australia over the next six months, a framework text says.The US and Australia have been working on these issues since Trump's first term, but Albanese said the latest agreement would take the partnership to the \"next level\".China currently controls about 70% of rare earths mining and 90% of the processing of the materials, which are found in everything from defence equipment to computer chips and cars. US companies rely heavily on the materials, making them vulnerable this year as China has taken steps to restrict access to supplies in response to new US tariffs and other tensions. Albanese said the agreement was aimed at speeding investment in three types of projects, including US investments in processing facilities in Australia. The two countries also agreed to work together on issues such as pricing, permitting, and rules for government review of the sales of companies and projects in the sector. The US separately said it would invest in the construction of a 100 tonnes-per-year advanced gallium refinery in Western Australia and was preparing to offer some $2.2bn in financing to advance critical minerals projects via its Export-Import Bank. The Trump administration in recent months has already announced a series of investments in companies such as US rare earths miner MP Materials and Canada's Trilogy Metals and Lithium America's, which have projects in the US.In exchange for the support, it has received ownership stakes in the firms. Ahead of the meeting, shares in Australian companies such as Lynas Rare Earths had jumped on the prospect of increased support. Lynas was awarded a contract by the US Defense Department a few years ago and is working on a project in Texas.The framework published by the White House was light on details, reflecting the delicate issues at play. Australia is a major source of critical minerals but like the US, it relies on China, its biggest trade partner, for the processing required to turn the materials into something companies can use. ",

    "body": "Japan has for the first time approved over-the-counter sales of an emergency contraceptive pill, its manufacturer says, allowing women in the country to take the medication without prescription.ASKA Pharmaceutical said wider access to the pill would \"empower Japanese women in the area of reproductive health\". A date for it to go on sale has yet to be announced.The pill will be labelled as \"medicine requiring guidance\", meaning women must take it in the presence of a pharmacist.The \"morning-after\" pill - a form of emergency contraception - is already available without prescription in more than 90 countries, and is designed to prevent an unwanted pregnancy.It works by stopping a woman's egg from fully developing or attaching to the wall of the uterus. It usually has to be taken within three to five days of having unprotected sex - but the sooner it is taken, the more effective it is.Japan's conservative views, rooted in patriarchy and deeply traditional views on the role of women, mean it has been slow to approve drugs related to women's reproductive health.ASKA Pharmaceutical said in a statement on Monday that it \"has obtained the marketing authorisation as a switch to OTC [over-the-counter] use of the emergency contraceptive pill commercialised under the trademark Norlevo\".There will be no age restrictions on buyers and no requirement for parental consent, the daily newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported.The company said it had filed for regulatory approval in 2024, following prescription-free trial sales of the pill the year before.During the trial, Norlevo was made available at 145 pharmacies in Japan. Until then, the pill had only been supplied at clinics or pharmacies with a doctor's examination and prescription.At the time, rights groups criticised the trial, saying it was too small, and called for restrictions to be lifted. Campaigners have long argued that requiring a prescription deterred younger women and rape victims from accessing emergency contraception.Selling the drug without prescription was first discussed by a health ministry panel in 2017 - the public consultation found overwhelming support across the country.But officials stopped short of giving it the green light then, saying that making it more easily available would encourage irresponsible use of the \"morning-after\" pill.Norlevo - and the generic version levonorgestrel - works best within 72 hours after unprotected sex and has an efficacy rate of 80%.",

    "body": "1 hour agoIone WellsSouth America correspondent, in Sao PauloBrazil's state oil firm has received a licence to conduct exploratory oil drilling in the sea off the Amazon, despite environmental concerns about the project.The approval will allow Petrobras to drill in a block located in AmapÃ¡, 500km (311 miles) from the mouth of the Amazon River on the Brazilian Equatorial Margin.The company said it had demonstrated to the government that it had robust environmental protection structures in place.But many conservationists have raised concerns about plans, including fears that any oil spills would be in proximity, via sea currents, to the Amazon, which is home to around 10% of the world's known species.Groups such as Greenpeace have also raised concerns it could undermine Brazil's climate leadership ahead of hosting the COP30 climate summit in the Amazonian city of BelÃ©m in November.The International Energy Agency has also been clear that no new oil projects should be approved if the target of net zero global emissions is to be reached by 2050.Petrobras said in a statement that drilling was scheduled to begin \"immediately\" and that it would last for five months. The company is seeking to assess whether there is oil and gas in the area on an economically viable scale.It would not produce oil commercially at this stage.Brazil's environment minister, Marina Silva, has opposed oil exploration in the Amazon region.But the South American nation's President Lula da Silva has supported it for economic reasons and recently defended his stance.Lula told the BBC in September: \"Brazil is a country that has oil. And possibly we have oil in the Equatorial Margin, and we are making surveys. We're following the law strictly.\"He said that if there was a problem or an oil spill, then \"we will be the ones that are liable and responsible to take care of the problem, if it comes\".He added: \"I am totally in favour of a world one day that will not need any more fossil fuels, but this moment has not come yet. \"I want to know [of] any country on the planet that is prepared to have an energy transition and can give up fossil fuels.\"Other international oil companies, including Exxonmobil and Chevron, have bought \"blocks\" in the Amazon region and are awaiting licences to explore.Petrobras said it was committed to ensuring the country's \"energy security and the resources needed for a just energy transition\".It added that the company was able to \"demonstrate the robustness of the entire environmental protection structure that will be available during drilling\".",

    "body": "Hamas has handed over a body that it says is a hostage, the Israeli military has said.The body was transported by the Red Cross to Israeli forces in Gaza, and will now be returned to Israel for formal identification.Before Monday, Hamas had handed over all 20 living hostages and 12 out of 28 deceased hostages under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal that began on 10 October.There has been anger in Israel that Hamas has not yet returned all the deceased hostages, with the Israeli military saying the Palestinian armed group \"is required to uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages\".Hamas has said it faces difficulty finding bodies under rubble in Gaza.Under the agreement, Israel has also freed 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza, and returned 15 bodies of Palestinians in return for every Israeli hostage's remains.The first phase has also seen an increase of aid into the Gaza Strip, a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a halt in fighting - though deadly violence flared up on Sunday as both sides accused one another of breaching the deal.Israel said it struck dozens of Hamas targets across the Strip after accusing Hamas of an attack that killed two of its soldiers in Rafah. Hamas had said it was \"unaware\" of any clashes in the area, which is under Israeli control.At least 45 Palestinians were killed in the strikes, local hospitals said.On Sunday evening, Israel said it was resuming enforcement of the ceasefire, adding that it would \"respond firmly to any violation of it\". Hamas had earlier said it remained committed to the agreement.US President Donald Trump said the truce remained in place, as his envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner travelled to Israel. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) currently holds about half of Gaza, demarcated by a so-called Yellow Line.With Palestinians expressing confusion about the exact location of the line, the IDF has put out a video showing bulldozers towing yellow blocks into place to mark it out.On Monday, Palestinian health officials said Israeli fire killed three people east of Gaza City. The IDF said its troops fired towards \"several terrorists\" who crossed the Yellow Line in the Shejaiya area.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 68,216 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.",

    "body": "Bolivia elects centrist Rodrigo Paz, ending decades of socialist rule12 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondent, in SÃ£o PauloEPA/ShutterstockRodrigo Paz campaigned on a promise to bring \"capitalism for all\" to BoliviaBolivia has elected a centrist senator, Rodrigo Paz, as its next president, bringing an end to nearly 20 years of continuous rule by the Movement for Socialism (Mas) party.With almost all votes counted, Paz, of the Christian Democratic Party, defeated right-wing candidate Jorge \"Tuto\" Quiroga in Sunday's run-off election with a share of 54.6%.A severe economic crisis and infighting within Mas, which has dominated Bolivian politics since 2006, saw many voters wanting change.Paz, 58, has said he will end fuel shortages and address Bolivia's wider economic problems. In his victory speech, he said he would open up Bolivia to wider international investment and stimulate private-sector growth.Paz went from being a surprise frontrunner in the first round of the election in August to achieving a clear win over Tuto Quiroga, who received 45.4% of the votes in the run-off. The candidate for Mas did not make it into the final round of voting.Paz is perceived as relatively moderate and centrist compared to his opponent, making him more attractive to undecided and disillusioned left-leaning voters, who wanted change but did not want to cast their vote for Quiroga.Quiroga has conceded defeat and has called his rival to congratulate him. Paz's supporters took to the streets of La Paz, the country's administrative capital, to celebrate the result. One of them told news agency AFP that \"we came to celebrate the victory with great hope of a new direction for Bolivia\".EPA/ShutterstockConservative former President Jorge Quiroga had hoped to win the election this time but was beaten by PazBolivia is grappling with severe shortages of fuel leading to long queues at petrol stations, a shortage of US dollars, and soaring inflation. Natural gas exports, which were once a major source of revenue for Bolivia, have also plummeted.Paz campaigned with the slogan \"capitalism for all\", promising free-market reforms and a commitment to help the poorest in society with social programmes.He has pledged to ease access to credit for small businesses, lower certain taxes, reduce import tariffs, crack down on corruption, and decentralise the government.He has also been clear that once in power, he plans to cut fuel subsidies, which he says are unsustainable. The subsidies have kept fuel prices relatively low but - because they mean that fuel is being sold at prices below import costs - have also lead to shortages and huge queues at pumps.EPA/ShutterstockMany indigenous Bolivians traditionally supported the Mas party, but its candidate did not make it into the run-offBolivia has been relatively isolated on the world stage in recent years but Paz's election victory could signal a thawing of relations between Bolivia and the US, which have not had a formal diplomatic relationship since 2008.Relations between the two countries have been strained since 2008 when Bolivia's then-President Evo Morales expelled the US ambassador and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for allegedly conspiring against his government. The US has repeatedly accused Bolivia, one of the world's top producers of cocaine, of not meeting its anti-narcotics obligations, and has long criticised its recognition of Venezuela's President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, whose last election was widely condemned internationally as being neither free nor fair.Reacting to Paz's election win, the US State Department said it looked forward \"to partnering with President-elect Rodrigo Paz to restore economic stability, expand private-sector growth, and strengthen security\". Once he takes office, Paz may make the calculation that distancing the country from allies including Venezuela and Cuba could help rebuild relations with US.Regarding China, an important trade partner for Bolivia which is the source of many imports and a key destination for Bolivia's minerals and lithium exports, Paz will likely try to secure new foreign investment and exports.ReutersFormer President Evo Morales was banned from running for office again - he has already been president three timesPaz's choice of running mate is thought to have helped him attract working-class voters and Bolivian's frustrated with government corruption. A former police captain, Vice-President-elect Edman Lara is known for his humble upbringing and whistleblowing on police corruption. He also a strong social media following.In the months leading up to the vote, Mas's popularity had been undermined by bitter divisions between two of its best known figures: the former president, Evo Morales, and the outgoing president, Luis Arce. Morales, who governed from 2006-2019, was disqualified from running in this election due to a ruling that limits presidents to two terms in office. As Morales has served a total of three terms as president - one before the constitutional two-term limit came into force - he was not able to stand again for the top job.Accused of statutory rape and fathering a child with a teenager - allegations he denies and says are politically motivated - he has been living in his stronghold of Chapare, where he is protected by his loyal supporters who have at times staged protests and roadblocks around the country leading to clashes. As voting is mandatory in Bolivia, he urged his supporters to spoil their votes rather than cast a ballot paper for either of the two candidates in the run-off. For many Bolivians, this election result reflects a desire for change and renewal. But Paz inherits tough economic circumstances and a bitterly divided country.Restoring economic credibility and uniting a country polarised into many factions after years of political turmoil will not be an easy task.Paz will take office on 8 November.More on the Bolivian election",

    "body": "11 hours agoMartin Yipin Hong Kong, andStuart LauWatch: Wreckage of cargo plane seen at Hong Kong International AirportTwo Hong Kong airport security staff were killed when a cargo plane skidded off a runway, hit their patrol vehicle and ploughed into the sea.Emirates flight EK9788 was arriving from Dubai at about 03:50 local time on Monday (19:50 GMT on Sunday) when it veered off the runway, crashed through perimeter fencing and collided with the vehicle, pushing it into the water.The two people inside died. The Boeing 747 ended up partly submerged, but its four crew survived. Officials are investigating the cause of the crash on the north runway. Two other runways remain operational. It is one of the deadliest aviation incidents in years at Hong Kong International Airport, which has a good safety record.The investigation will focus on the unanswered questions over the path taken by the plane upon landing.Airport officials have said they gave the correct instructions to the plane and that there were signs on the runway to guide aircraft.Airport operations executive director Steven Yiu said the patrol car was, at the time, travelling on a road outside of the runway's fencing \"at a safe distance from the runway\". The plane then turned away from the runway, crashed through the fencing and collided with the vehicle, pushing it into the sea, Mr Yiu explained.\"Normally the plane is not supposed to turn towards the sea,\" he said at a news conference hours after the incident, adding that the plane did not send out a distress signal when it was landing.He stressed that the airport patrol car \"definitely did not run out onto the runway\".The weather, runway conditions, the aircraft and its crew will all be looked at as part of the investigation, Mr Yiu said.Divers managed to locate the bodies of the patrol vehicle's driver and passenger.The two dead ground staff were aged 30 and 41, and had seven and 12 years' experience, respectively, officials said. Neither was breathing when recovered from the vehicle, which was five metres (16.4 feet) from shore and seven metres under water. The younger of the two was confirmed dead at the scene, and the other later in hospital.  Hong Kong's transport bureau has said it was \"saddened\" by their deaths and expressed condolences to their families.An Emirates spokesperson said in a statement to the BBC that the plane \"sustained damage on landing in Hong Kong\", adding: \"Crew are confirmed to be safe and there was no cargo onboard.\"It also said the Boeing 747-481 cargo aircraft was wet leased from, and operated by, Turkish carrier Act Airlines. A wet lease is an arrangement where one airline provides the aircraft, crew and insurance to another.The four crew members onboard the plane had opened the aircraft's emergency doors shortly after the crash. They were spotted by fire service staff who arrived at the scene within two minutes and were rescued, authorities said.Pictures show the plane had broken in half, with part of the fuselage submerged in the water with large cracks clearly visible. At least one emergency evacuation slide deployed successfully.ReutersPart of the plane's fuselage is lying in the water off the runwayA police official told the media that criminal investigations could not be ruled out.An official from the Hong Kong Air Accident Investigation Authority (AAIA) said it was still trying to locate the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder - also known as the black boxes - from the sea.The affected runway would remain closed for the rest of the day, but the airport's other two runways remain in operation.At least 11 cargo flights initially scheduled to arrive at Hong Kong International Airport on Monday have been cancelled, according to the Airport Authority's website.It marks the second ever deadly incident at the airport since it moved from Kai Tak to Chek Lap Kok in July 1998. In August 1999, a China Airlines passenger flight crash landed during a typhoon, killing three.",

    "body": "4 hours agoTom Bennettin Jerusalem, andAlaa Daraghmein Ramallah, occupied West BankA 55-year-old Palestinian woman has been taken to hospital after being clubbed over the head by a masked Jewish settler as she was picking olives.The unprovoked attack, which took place on Sunday morning in the Palestinian village of Turmus Ayya in the occupied West Bank, was captured on video by US journalist Jasper Nathaniel.Mr Nathaniel said the settler knocked the woman unconscious with the first strike of his stick, before hitting her again as she lay on the ground. She has been named locally as Umm Saleh Abu Alia.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC the confrontation was dispersed after its forces arrived, and that it \"strongly condemns any form of violence\" by settlers. However, Mr Nathaniel said Israeli soldiers were on-site prior to the attack and had \"lured\" him and others into an \"ambush\". He said soldiers \"sped off\" just before the settlers launched the assault. The BBC has put this specific allegation to the IDF.At least 80% of residents of Turmus Ayya hold US citizenship or residency, according to Israeli media. The BBC has reached out to the US State Department and US embassy for comment.The young male attacker is seen in the footage wielding a large wooden stick with a knot at one end, reminiscent of a club, before he swings it overhead and strikes Mrs Abu Alia.\"It's the most vivid image that's ever been seared in my mind,\" Mr Nathaniel told the BBC.\"He swings it one time and I saw her body go completely limp. And then he stood over her and hit her twice more.\"The mother of five is then seen bleeding as she is carried into a vehicle to be taken to hospital. She was initially admitted to an intensive care unit but is now in a stable condition, doctors say.Her cousin, Hamdi Abu Alia, told the BBC that medical staff found she had been struck twice in the head. Amin Abu Alia, the mayor of the adjacent village al-Mughayyir, confirmed details of the attack to the BBC.The attack was part of a wider incident in which at least 15 masked settlers were seen hurling stones and attacking other Palestinians who were harvesting olives - as well as activists who had arrived to support them, including Mr Nathaniel.At least one car was torched. Others had their windows smashed.The assault comes amid a spate of attacks in recent weeks linked to the olive harvest, which officially began on 9 October.The harvest is an age-old ritual that forms a major part of Palestinian culture. It is also an economic necessity for many, but is increasingly precarious.Farmers across the West Bank - internationally regarded as Palestinian land occupied by Israel - face heightened risks during harvest season, including organised assaults and the use of force by Israeli security forces to block roads and Palestinians' access to their lands.Of the 71 settler attacks documented by the UN's humanitarian office, Ocha, across the West Bank between 7 and 13 October, half were related to the ongoing harvest season. The attacks affected Palestinians in 27 villages.In 2025, more than 3,200 Palestinians have been injured in settler attacks across the West Bank, according to Ocha.Attacks are intended, monitors say, to intimidate Palestinians and eventually drive them from their land so settlers can seize it. The vast majority go unpunished, with just 3% of official investigations into settler violence between 2005 and 2023 ending in a conviction, according to Israeli civil rights group Yesh Din. Many incidents are not investigated.Shortly after entering office, US President Donald Trump cancelled a range of sanctions imposed on Israeli settlers by his predecessor Joe Biden.",

    "body": "14 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThe 4.8% growth in the third quarter marked a slowdown from 5.2% in the three months to JulyChina's economic growth slowed in the three months to the end of September as problems in the property market persisted and trade tensions with the US flared up.The world's second-largest economy grew by 4.8% compared to the same period in 2024, its weakest pace in a year, official figures released on Monday show.The data comes after China imposed sweeping controls on its exports of rare earths - minerals essential for the global production of electronics - a move that rocked its fragile trade truce with the US.The third-quarter growth figures will set the tone for a gathering of China's top leaders this week to discuss the country's economic blueprint over the next five years.The latest growth figure marked a slowdown from the annual rate of 5.2% seen in the three months to July.China's National Bureau of Statistics said the economy showed \"strong resilience and vitality\" against pressure . It credited momentum in its technology sector and business services as key growth drivers.Beijing has set a goal of \"around 5%\" economic growth this year and has so far avoided a sharp downturn, helped by government support measures and what - until recently - had been a trade ceasefire with Washington.When China announced controls on rare earths earlier this month, US President Donald Trump responded swiftly by threatening an additional 100% tariffs on imports from China.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said he expects to meet Chinese officials this week in Malaysia in an attempt to ease tensions and set up a meeting between Trump and his counterpart Xi Jinping.Before the recent flare-up, Chinese businesses had taken advantage of the trade truce with Washington to ship goods to the US, resulting in China's exports rising by 8.4% in September. The total value of imports to China was also up.China's industrial output grew by 6.5% last month from a year earlier, with its 3D-printing, robotics and electric vehicles manufacturers among its strongest performers.Its service sector, which includes IT support, consultancies, and transport and logistics companies, also grew.Getty ImagesChina has been struggling with a property crisis since 2021The latest data shows that China's exports have helped to offset its \"sluggish\" domestic spending, according to Sheana Yue, senior economist at Oxford Economics.Beijing has spent billions on incentives such as subsidies, higher wages and discounts to encourage locals to spend more and lift its economy.However, Ms Yue said it was unlikely China's economic growth this year would exceed 4.8% without further government support, which could come with the new Five-Year Plan laying out Beijing's economic goals.China's property sector also continued to struggle as real estate investment fell 13.9% in the year up to September.The housing market is going through a sharp downturn, marked by falling home prices, shrinking sales and instances of developers abandoning their projects.The real estate sector accounts for about a third of the Chinese economy and has been a major source of income for local governments.Home prices have fallen in almost every major city despite government support measures, said economics lecturer Laura Wu from Nanyang Technological University.In the long-run, housing \"is still the major drag on China's economic growth\" even as it faces uncertainty from Washington's tariffs and other trade barriers, said Prof Wu.",

Its armed wing - the Eastern Security Network - has been accused of killings and other acts of violence in recent years.Kanu was first arrested in October 2015 on terrorism charges but he jumped bail in 2017 and left the country after a military raid on his home. The court later revoked his bail in March 2019 and ordered his re-arrest.Two years later, the Nigerian government announced his re-arrest. His lawyers say he was detained in Kenya, which has not commented on whether it played a role in his deportation to Nigeria.In 2022, an appeal court ordered that the charges against him be dropped but this was overturned by the Supreme Court the following year.His legal team is due to start his defence on Thursday after the court threw out their argument that he had no case to answer.

    "body": "Kevin Federline has held off writing about Britney Spears. Until now8 minutes agoAna Faguy andJames FitzGeraldGetty ImagesThe pair's divorce was finalised in 2007The ex-husband of pop star Britney Spears gives new details on the pair's tense relationship in his new memoir You Thought You Knew.Kevin Federline, her one-time backing dancer, presents a picture of Spears's allegedly erratic behaviour as a wife and mother, and says he continues to have concerns for her wellbeing.Spears has spoken out against the book, which will be published on Tuesday, and accuses Federline of trying to profit from his association with her.Federline makes a number of allegations against Spears, in the memoir shared with the BBC ahead of the book's release by publisher Listenin. He accuses Spears of unhealthy behaviour as a mother, including drinking when she was pregnant and taking cocaine while her two sons were still breastfeeding. Spears has previously denied having substance abuse issues.When they were teenagers, the couple's sons were fearful of Spears, Federline also alleges. \"They would awaken sometimes at night to find her standing silently in the doorway, watching them sleep - 'Oh, you're awake?' - with a knife in her hand,\" he writes. \"Then she'd turn around and pad off without explanation.\"Federline also expresses his concern for his estranged ex-wife, writing: \"The truth is, this situation with Britney feels like it's racing toward something irreversible. From where I sit, the clock is ticking, and we're getting close to the 11th hour.\"He writes that he was supportive of a conservatorship, under which many aspects of Spears's life were controlled by others for years. Of the Free Britney movement, Federline writes that he could \"never fully get behind it\".What's the history of their relationship?The pair got together in the summer of 2004, after Spears's commercial peak.They married a few months later and quickly welcomed their two sons: Preston, now 20, and Jayden, now 19.Spears filed for divorce in 2006 and the divorce was finalised in 2007.The couple fought publicly over custody of their sons and ultimately Federline was given sole custody of the boys.In the wake of Federline getting full custody, Spears was seen behaving in a way that Federline characterises in his book as erratic.She made headlines with incidents like shaving her head and hitting a photographer's car with an umbrella.Those public incidents raised concern about her mental welfare, and after she was taken to hospital twice, a temporary conservatorship was established in 2008 and made permanent later that year.Spears remained under that controversial arrangement until 2021, under which her father and others controlled her finances and aspects of her personal life. She did not regain custody of her children until after it was lifted.What has Spears said? Spears has accused Federline of attacking her during his recent press appearances to promote the book. She described the contents of the memoir as \"extremely hurtful and exhausting\", but suggested the work would sell better than her own memoir had done.In that book, The Woman in Me, Spears accused her ex-husband of trying to \"convince everyone I was completely out of control\".Spears has also defended her relationship with her sons. \"I have always pleaded and screamed to have a life with my boys,\" she wrote on social media on 15 October, adding that \"relationships with teenage boys is complex\".In a statement to US media, a Spears spokesperson added: \"With news from Kevin's book breaking, once again he and others are profiting off her and sadly it comes after child support has ended with Kevin. All she cares about are her kids, Sean Preston and Jayden James, and their well-being during this sensationalism. She detailed her journey in her memoir.\"The BBC has contacted Federline's lawyer for comment on Spears's counter-accusations.Why is this happening now?While the pair dominated headlines during their relationship and subsequent divorce, Federline in particular has largely remained out of the limelight in recent years. And recently, the spotlight on Spears has largely been over her social media postings.Federline has said he considered writing a book for many years but wanted to wait until his children were older to complete it.\"I picked it up and put it down quite a lot over probably a five-year period,\" he told the Associated Press. \"I think that it's a very good description of me, who I am, the father I've become, the husband I am, the ex-husband I am.\"He also told AP: \"I want my children to be able to move forward in their lives and know that the actual truth of everything is out there.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterGetty ImagesMuch of Virginia Giuffre's story has been heard before but in her memoir, published posthumously, the abuse is described in appalling detail.Two days ahead of the book's official publication, the BBC got hold of a copy.There are revelations about Ms Giuffre's encounters with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell - as well as more details of her allegations about Prince Andrew, which he has always denied.Here's what we learned from the 367-page-long book.Prince Andrew allegations - and an 'orgy'In the memoir, Ms Giuffre says she had sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions.The third time, she says, was on Epstein's island as part of what Ms Giuffre called \"an orgy\".\"Epstein, Andy, and approximately eight other young girls and I had sex together,\" she says.\"The other girls all appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn't really speak English. Epstein laughed about how they couldn't really communicate, saying they are the easiest girls to get along with.\"She later recalls seeing the photo of Epstein walking in New York's central park with Prince Andrew, published in newspapers around the world in 2011.\"I was of course revolted to see two of my abusers together, out for a stroll,\" she writes.\"But mostly I was amazed that a member of the Royal Family would be stupid enough to appear in public with Epstein\".Prince Andrew, who reached a financial settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. In 2019, he told BBC Newsnight he did not remember meeting Ms Giuffre \"at all\", and that they \"never had any sort of sexual contact.\"News Syndication'Epstein told me I'd had a miscarriage'Shortly after the alleged \"orgy\" Ms Giuffre says she \"wasn't in great shape\", and had irregular bleeding and a tenderness in her abdomen.She says Epstein took her to a hospital, where she remembers being taken to an examination room. However, she says she is unclear what happened next due to pain medication affecting her memory.Soon after, she writes, one of the other girls in Epstein's house suggested to her that an incision mark near her belly button could mean she had surgery for an ectopic pregnancy.\"But Epstein told me I'd suffered a miscarriage, which is altogether something different,\" Ms Giuffre says.\"Epstein never wore a condom. Neither did the men he and Maxwell trafficked me to.\"Memories of Epstein 'torture' GiuffreAt the centre of the abuse was the late Epstein and his former girlfriend Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year sentence on sex-trafficking charges.Ms Giuffre says that even after many years, the memories of what Epstein put her through \"torture\" her - and says she she feared she might \"die a sex slave\" at the hands of Epstein and his circle.The memoir includes shocking descriptions of sadomasochistic sex.She says Epstein developed an interest in it over time, and began to \"experiment with whips and restraints and other instruments of torture\".\"In session after session, he would play out various fantasies, with me as the victim,\" she writes.She says the chains and contraptions he used on her \"caused so much pain that I prayed I would black out\". But she adds: \"When I did, I'd awaken to more abuse\".Ms Giuffre also details the physical effects such abuse had on her body, with dark circles under her eyes and her ribs visible beneath her skin.Rather than offering any care, Epstein was \"disgusted\" at her appearance, she says.\"'You're not the same girl you were,' Epstein said coldly. 'You need to clean yourself up',\" she writes in the book.Maxwell's part in the abuseMs Giuffre goes into detail about how she first met Maxwell, and how she introduced her to Epstein.She says Maxwell turned up at the Mar-a-Lago spa, where a teenage Ms Giuffre was working.\"She looks to be in her late thirties, and her British accent reminds me of Mary Poppins,\" Ms Giuffre recalls.She says Maxwell asked her to come for a job interview as a masseuse.When she arrived at the house, Ms Giuffre says she was taken to a room where Epstein was completely naked on a massage table. \"Just do what I do,\" she says Maxwell told her.Ms Giuffre says she started giving Epstein a massage. She says Maxwell then took her clothes off, and undressed Ms Giuffre, and they sexually abused her.\"The disappointment was excruciating. I blamed myself. 'Is sex all anyone will ever want from me',\" she writes.She later describes how Maxwell facilitated the introduction to Prince Andrew in March 2001.She writes that Maxwell woke her up and told her it was going to be a \"special day\" - that \"just like Cinderella\" she was going to meet a \"handsome prince\".Ms Giuffre later writes that even decades later, she remembers how much she feared both Epstein and Maxwell.Disappointment at Epstein's deathOne of the other themes running through the book is Ms Giuffre's desire for accountability.Epstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a person under the age of 18. He died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.Ms Giuffre describes feeling disappointed at his death. \"This wasn't how justice was supposed to work out,\" she says.On Prince Andrew, she recalls standing outside a courtroom and telling journalists: \"He knows exactly what he's doneâ¦ and I hope he comes clean about it.\"She later writes that she hopes the royal - who has always denied wrongdoing - will be \"held to account\".The most powerful words are perhaps saved for the ending of the book.\"In my mind, I hold a picture of a girl reaching out for help and easily finding it,\" Ms Giuffre writes.\"I picture a woman, too, who - having come to terms with her childhood pain - feels that it's within her power to take action against those who hurt her.\"If this book moves us even an inch closer to a reality like that - if it helps just one person - I will have achieved my goal.\"",

    "body": "44 minutes agoJohn Sudworthin Kyiv, andMaia DaviesUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he would be ready to join Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin at a proposed summit in Hungary if he were invited.The US and Russian presidents announced after their phone call on Thursday that they planned to hold talks on the war in Ukraine in Budapest, possibly in the coming weeks.On Monday, Zelensky told reporters: \"If it is an invitation in a format where we meet as three or, as it's called, shuttle diplomacy... then in one format or another, we will agree\".Meanwhile, media reports suggest his White House meeting with Trump on Friday descended into a \"shouting match\" - with the US side urging Ukraine to accept Russia's terms to end the war.Zelensky was guarded during his first press briefing since the talks, but still his comments made clear that there were large areas of disagreement between the two sides.He described the meeting as frank, and said he had told Trump that his main aim was a just peace, not a quick peace.He criticised Hungary as the location of the prospective Trump-Putin talks, saying the country's Prime Minister Viktor Orban - who is seen by Kyiv and many EU leaders as a Kremlin ally - could not do \"anything positive for Ukrainians or even provide a balanced contribution\".When asked by reporters on Friday if Zelensky would be involved in the meeting in Budapest, Trump said he wanted to \"make it comfortable for everybody\".\"We'll be involved in threes, but it may be separated,\" he said, adding the three leaders \"have to get together\".Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio held a \"constructive\" phone call on preparations for the Budapest summit, Moscow said on Monday.Zelensky had hoped to secure US Tomahawk missiles to strike deep into Russia during his White House visit, but appeared to walk away empty-handed as Trump struck a non-committal tone on the matter.Media reports suggested the atmosphere at the Trump-Zelensky meeting had been far more acrimonious than previously understood.The Financial Times reported that Trump had warned Zelensky that Putin would \"destroy\" Ukraine if he did not agree to its terms, citing sources familiar with the conversation.The US side was said to have echoed Russian talking points at the \"volatile\" meeting. It also reported that Trump tossed aside maps of the front line in Ukraine and insisted Zelensky surrender the entire eastern Donbas region to Putin.Trump wrote on social media shortly after the meeting that Russia and Ukraine \"should stop where they are\" - referring to the current, vast front line.\"Let both claim Victory, let History decide!\" he said.Zelensky reacted by saying that he was ready for an immediate ceasefire - but insisted that Ukraine \"will not gift anything to the aggressor\".Commenting on the proposed freezing of the front line, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that Russia's position was \"unchanged\" - without giving any further details. Moscow has repeatedly demanded a complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from Ukraine's four regions in the south-east - Donetsk, Luhansk (collectively known as Donbas), Zaporizhzhia and Kherson - as well as several other tough conditions.Kyiv and its allies say the demands are tantamount to a de facto capitulation.Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the southern Crimea peninsular Moscow annexed in 2014.\"We really didn't get what we wanted,\" Ukrainian political analyst Mykola Davyduik said of the latest Trump-Zelensky meeting.\"A few days after, we received some insights from the meeting and some threats and pressure that the Ukrainian side received there,\" he told the BBC.But he added: \"I don't think that Trump is fully and completely on Putin's side, and he is trying to play mediator... and that is his kind of style and how he behaves in such a situation.\"Ivan Stupak, however, a former member of Ukraine's security and intelligence service (SBU), said reports of acrimony were likely exaggerated.\"I'm totally sure that this meeting was neutral, not negative, not a disaster,\" he told the BBC, adding that tempers sometimes flare, even between allies.\"It's not Disneyland, it's not a kindergarten. It's a meeting of two men and two leaders.\"Just last month, Trump appeared to take a major shift in his position on ending the war by saying Kyiv could \"win all of Ukraine back in its original form\", referring to Ukraine's internationally recognised borders.He said at the time that his position had changed \"after getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia military and economic situation\".In a new twist on Monday, Trump said that Ukraine \"could still win it\", adding: \"I don't think they will... Anything can happen... war is a very strange thing.\"Trump had previously warned the process would likely involve Ukraine giving up some territory - an outcome Zelensky has consistently rejected.The US president has been pressuring Nato nations, as well as China and India, to stop purchasing Russian oil in a bid to create further economic pressure on Moscow to end the conflict.He also previously threatened Russia with tougher sanctions if Putin did not meet deadlines to make progress in ending the war, though he did not follow through with those threats.Trump's public relations with Zelensky had also vastly improved in recent months, after an Oval Office meeting in February during which he and Vice-President JD Vance berated the Ukrainian president on live television.During his re-election campaign, Trump claimed he would be able to end the war in Ukraine within days but has since admitted resolving the conflict has been more challenging than any he has been involved in since returning to office.",

    "body": "These confederate statues caused US protests. Knocked down, they're the centre of a new art show3 hours agoRegan MorrisLos AngelesBBC / Regan MorrisA statue of Matthew Fontaine Maury, a Confederate officer, on display A massive monument of General Robert E Lee that once sparked riots in the Virginia city of Charlottesville is now a pile of melted-down bronze, artfully displayed in a Los Angeles museum.Next to the sculpture are barrels of toxic \"slag\" leftover from the melting process.Around the corner, there is a massive, graffitied equestrian statue of Lee and Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson â the two most famous Confederate generals in the US Civil War, which the Confederacy lost in 1865 and ultimately led to the end of slavery in the United States.\"They fought for slavery,\" says curator Hamza Walker, who has been working for eight years to acquire and borrow the massive monuments amid lawsuits and the logistical challenges of moving tens of thousands of pounds of bronze and granite to Los Angeles.\"The idea of lionising those figures. What did they believe? They believed in white supremacy. Period.\"Coming at a time when President Donald Trump is ordering statues and paintings of Confederate generals to be reinstalled, the warring narratives of American history are at the heart of \"Monuments,\" which opens 23 October at The Brick and at the Geffen Contemporary at the Museum of Contemporary Art.The 18 decommissioned Confederate monuments are displayed alongside pieces of contemporary art. The massive, graffitied statue of Lee and Jackson, for example, stands next to a giant replica sculpture of the \"General Lee\" car from the iconic TV show, The Dukes of Hazzard.BBC / Regan MorrisJalane Schmidt, an activist who campaigned for the statue of Lee to be removed from Charlottesville, stands in front of the sculpture the statue has becomePresident Trump has often spoken of General Lee's bravery and he and others have criticised the removal and toppling of Confederate monuments, saying it's revisionist history. White nationalists marched in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017, triggering deadly clashes, to keep the statue from being removed. In the aftermath, similar statues sparked clashes in cities across the US. \"Under this historical revision, our Nation's unparalleled legacy of advancing liberty, individual rights, and human happiness is reconstructed as inherently racist, sexist, oppressive, or otherwise irredeemably flawed,\" President Trump wrote in a March executive order calling for paintings and monuments to be reinstalled.But Mr Walker says putting Lee and Jackson on pedestals â even though they lost the war â is racist and promotes the Lost Cause ideology that argues the Civil War was a noble cause for states' rights and not about slavery.\"States rights to do what? The reason for the Civil War was slavery,\" he said, adding that it perpetuates the idea that the South was a \"noble victim\", and that slavery wasn't so terrible.\"If you could distance them from slavery, right, then you could portray them as heroes, even though they lost the war and were on the wrong side of history, fighting for something that was morally repugnant,\" he says.BBC Keith âChuckâ Tayman\"Unmanned Drone\" by artist Kara Walker is the centrepiece of the exhibit The centrepiece of the show is \"Unmanned Drone\" â a completely reconstructed sculpture of Stonewall Jackson by artist Kara Walker, who transformed the horse and its rider heading into battle into a headless, zombie-like creature.\"The southern vernacular would be a 'haint', which would be a ghostly form,\" Kara Walker, who is not related to Hamza Walker, told the BBC when asked how she describes the work. \"It's an attempt to rethink the legacies of Stonewall Jackson as a mythology, as mythological holder for white supremacy.\"Most of the monuments on display will be returned to the cities and towns they've been borrowed from when the show closes in May. But Kara Walker's sculpture will need to find a new home. And the bronze ingots from the melted down Lee sculpture will be transformed again into a new work of art.The statue was removed in 2021 and melted in 2023 after the Charlottesville City Council voted to donate the statue to the Jefferson School - African American Heritage Center.\"It's a toxic representation of history, this lost cause narrative, and we're purifying it,\" says Jalane Schmidt, an activist and professor who was there when the statue came down in Charlottesville, and when it was melted at a secret foundry. She came to see it in its new form in Los Angeles.Getty ImagesWhite nationalists marched on Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017Living in Charlottesville, she said, the statue was always in the background until a teenage girl in 2016 started a petition to rename Lee Park and remove the statue because she found it offensive that the city would celebrate someone who fought for slavery.The statue was the focal point for the Unite the Right rally in 2017, which turned deadly when a 21-year-old white nationalist ploughed his car into counter protesters killing Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old paralegal and civil rights activist.Schmidt says the petition and the rally changed public opinion about the monuments in Charlottesville and elsewhere. \"Especially after Unite the Right, after we were attacked, well, clearly this was evidence that, you know, people are willing to die for symbols, but they're also willing to kill for them,\" she said. \"We had to remove them just for our own health.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoFan WangCostfoto/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesA Su-35 fighter jet - the model Australia says was used by the PLA in Sunday's encounter - seen at the 2024 Zhuhai Air Show in ChinaAustralia has accused a Chinese military aircraft of releasing flares \"in close proximity\" to its patrol jet over the South China Sea.The Australian government has raised its concern with Beijing over the \"unsafe and unprofessional\" manoeuvre, the defence department said in a statement on Monday.There was no damage to Australia's P-8A aircraft and its personnel were unharmed after Sunday's encounter.A Chinese military spokesperson said the Australian jet \"illegally intruded\" into China's airspace and had to be expelled. The Australian aircraft's actions \"seriously infringed upon China's sovereignty\", Senior Colonel Li Jianjian, spokesperson for China's Southern Theater Command Air Force said, urging Canberra to \"immediately cease its infringing and provocative actions\".Australia Defence Force said it expects all countries, including China, to operate their militaries in a safe and professional manner.This is the latest in a string of encounters between the two countries' militaries in the region, where China's vast claims over islands and outcrops overlap with those of its neighbours.Sunday's incident also occurred as Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was heading to the US for a meeting with President Donald Trump, where the two leaders are expected to discuss the Aukus - a multi-billion dollar submarine deal between Australia, the US and the UK. Australia has also accused a Chinese jet of dropping flares near an Australian plane in the area in February. China at that time said the Australian jet had intentionally intruded into its airspace and that its response was \"lawful and restrained\".While it has no claims to the South China Sea, Australia has aligned itself close to the US and its allies in saying that China's assertions have no legal basis.In May last year, Australia accused a Chinese fighter plane of dropping flares close to an Australian navy helicopter that was part of a UN Security Council mission on the Yellow Sea off the Korean coastline.In November 2023, Canberra accused Beijing's navy of using sonar pulses in international waters off Japan, which resulted in injuries to Australian divers.",

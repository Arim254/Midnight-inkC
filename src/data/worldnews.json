    "body": "Nine people were injured, one critically, after a car crashed into a crowd during a demolition derby in southeastern Australia, police said.The car had been taking part in a race in the town of Walcha on Saturday night when it drove through a fence and hit the grandstand, New South Wales police said in a statement.The race, part of the annual Walcha Motorcycle Rally, had been a demolition derby - a type of motorsport where drivers ram their vehicles into one another.Police said ages of the injured bystanders ranged from 20 to 75, while the critically injured person was a 54-year-old man. An investigation was underway, they said.Police said they were told that the 27-year-old driver of the car had been involved in a collision on the track right before it drove into the fence.In a statement published on the Walcha Motorcycle Rally's Facebook page, the Walcha Council said that it was \"shocked and stunned at the unfortunate accident\".The Council said it would work with authorities to \"examine the circumstances which led to the accident\". Giving any comments before concluding the inquiries would be \"inappropriate\", it said.Brendan Moylan, a member of parliament for Northern Tablelands, the region where Walcha is located, thanked emergency responders and other bystanders for their \"swift and incredibly professional work at the scene\". \"My thoughts are with everyone affected,\" he wrote on Facebook.Barnaby Joyce, former deputy prime minister and incumbent New England lawmaker, wrote on Facebook that his \"thoughts, prayer and hopes\" were with those injured in the crash.\"Such a sad end to such a great event,\" he wrote.The Walcha Motorcycle Rally describes itself as a \"grassroots event for motorcycle enthusiasts\".",

    "body": "Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has confirmed it seized a tanker on Friday morning in the Strait of Hormuz.The Talara tanker, sailing under the flag of the Marshall Islands, was travelling from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to Singapore.The IRGC said it was found to be \"in violation of the law by carrying unauthorised cargo\", but did not provide details of the violation. Reports suggest it was carrying high-sulphur gasoil. Iran has periodically seized tankers and cargo ships travelling in and around the Persian Gulf, which is a key global shipping route for oil and liquefied natural gas. It has often cited maritime violations such as smuggling or legal issues. Maritime security company Ambrey said the Talara tanker had departed from Ajman in the United Arab Emirates and was heading south through the Strait of Hormuz when it was approached by three small boats, after which it made a \"sudden course deviation\".The US Navy's 5th fleet, which patrols the region, said on Friday it was \"actively monitoring the situation\".\"Commercial vessels are entitled to largely unimpeded rights of navigation and commerce on the high seas,\" it added. The company that manages the ship announced it had lost contact with the crew on Friday morning, while the tanker was 20 nautical miles off the coast of Sharjah's Khorfakkan port.The UK's Maritime Trade Operations Centre said it had received reports on the incident and advised vessels \"to transit with caution and report any suspicious activity\". Iran has for years threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, through which about 20% of all traded oil passes, in retaliation for Western sanctions and other actions against it. Its threats ramped up during the 12-day conflict with Israel in June - during which Israel and United States carried out a bombing campaign on Iran's nuclear facilities, and Iran retaliated by striking Israel. In April 2024, the IRGC seized a commercial ship with links to Israel, following a deadly attack on Iran's consulate in Syria which was blamed on Israel.",

    "body": "Disagreements between Donald Trump and Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene have ballooned into a public feud, signalling a breakdown in relations between the US president and one of his fiercest defenders.On Friday, Trump called Greene \"wacky\" in social media posts and said she should be unseated in next year's elections. On Saturday, he called her a \"traitor\". Greene has in recent days questioned whether Trump was still putting \"America First\" and criticised his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.The feud comes as the House is set to consider whether to release the files to the public.\"All I see \"Wacky\" Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!\" Trump posted on Friday night, claiming that she turned on him after he suggested that she shouldn't run for governor or senator in her home state of Georgia. \"She has told many people that she is upset that I don't return her phone calls anymore,\" Trump said, adding: \"I can't take a ranting Lunatic's call every day.\"He pledged to back any Republican opponent that takes her on in next year's midterm elections, when she is up for reelection, before intensifying his attacks in social media posts on Saturday from his home in Florida.\"Marjorie 'Traitor' Green [sic] is a disgrace to our GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY!\" he wrote.The comments follow days of criticism from Greene, who has said that Trump is not doing enough to bring down costs for voters. She also denounced his recent decisions in foreign conflicts and on tariff policies.But she has been most critical of his approach to handling the Epstein files. The turnaround is remarkable for a lawmaker who stood by Trump during multiple scandals, most notably the Capitol riot in 2021 when Trump supporters stormed the US legislature in an attempt to block Trump's election defeat. The US president also vigorously defended Greene when she was accused of promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories.Greene is one of only four House Republicans who joined Democrats in signing a discharge petition calling for the release of the Epstein files last week.On Friday, Greene posted on X that Trump was trying to stop other Republicans from voting in favour of the Epstein petition.\"He's coming after me hard to make an example to scare all the other Republicans before next weeks vote to release the Epstein files,\" she posted, adding: \"It's astonishing really how hard he's fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level.\"She returned to X on Saturday to say Trump's had made her a target for threats \"fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world\".\"As a Republican, who overwhelmingly votes for President Trump's bills and agenda, his aggression against me... is completely shocking to everyone,\" she wrote.\"I don't worship or serve Donald Trump,\" she wrote in one post.Former Republican pollster and strategist Robert Moran said it was clear the US president did not want the Epstein files to be released and \"is trying to pressure\" Greene. Mr Moran doubted the row would affect Trump's popularity as the electorate was so divided, but said it was inevitable the files would eventually come out. \"Many of his voters are sceptical of power and so they want power to be held to account, and they support the release of these files,\" he added.Trump has long faced criticism from both parties over his handling of the US Department of Justice files related to Epstein, the late financier and convicted paedophile. Trump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the US president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.",

    "body": "1 hour agoRuth Comerford and Ethirajan Anbarasan,global affairs reporterWatch: Protesters against violent crime and the Sheinbaum government clash with police in Mexico CityAt least 120 people - 100 of them police officers - have been injured in clashes during anti-government protests in Mexico City, police said.Thousands of demonstrators marched in the Mexican capital on Saturday to protest against violent crime and President Claudia Sheinbaum's government.Sheinbaum said the marches, which also took place in other cities, had been funded by right-wing politicians who oppose her government.The rally was organised by Gen Z youth groups, drawing support from citizens protesting against high-profile killings, including the assassination just weeks ago of Uruapan Mayor Carlos Manzo - who had called for tough action against cartels.Demonstrators dismantled parts of a barrier protecting the National Palace, where Sheinbaum lives. Police protecting the compound used tear gas on the crowds.Authorities have arrested 20 people for crimes including robbery and assault, Mexico City security chief Pablo Vazquez told reporters.Protesters waved banners displaying messages including \"We are all Carlos Manzo\", while others wore cowboy hats in tribute to him.Manzo was shot on 1 November while he attended a Day of the Dead festival.He was known for speaking openly about drug-trafficking gangs in his town and cartel violence. He had been demanding tough action against armed cartel members who terrorise the country. Sheinbaum has been acting against cartels but resisting calls for another all-out war on drugs. Previous attempts by her predecessors have ended with bloody results.Days before the march took place, the president said the demonstration was being promoted by bots online.\"We agree with freedom of expression and freedom of demonstration if there are young people who have demands, but the issue here is who is promoting the demonstration,\" she said in a briefing. \"People should know how this demonstration was organised so that no one is used.\"Sheinbaum retains approval ratings above 70% in her first year in office, and has made in-roads in clamping down on fentanyl-trafficking – a key issue for her US counterpart, Donald Trump.But she has been criticised for failing to halt the violence gripping the country and is facing increased hostility from nearby countries.Earlier this month, Peru's Congress voted to declare Sheinbaum a persona non grata - or unwelcome in the country.The decision came days after Peru severed diplomatic ties with Mexico, after the Mexican government granted asylum to a former Peruvian prime minister facing charges for a 2022 coup attempt.",

    "body": "12 hours agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent, RomeReutersPope Leo has held an audience with Hollywood stars, urging actors and directors including Cate Blanchett, Viggo Mortensen and Monica Bellucci to continue their work as \"pilgrims of the imagination\", helping to \"bring hope\".The celebrity meeting was a sprinkling of star dust for a still relatively new pope and a way for the Catholic Church to engage more with the world beyond.It was also a strong show of support from Leo XIV for the global film industry, as he spoke out against the \"troubling decline\" in cinema-going.Hailed by director Spike Lee as a \"great day\", the gathering was the first of its kind in the Vatican.Beneath the magnificent frescoes of the Clementine Hall, Pope Leo spoke in Italian to praise the power of cinema to entertain and to educate – and for its \"capacity to amaze\".But he urged filmmakers not to shy away from what he called \"the world's wounds\".\"Violence, poverty, exile, loneliness, addiction and forgotten wars are issues that need to be acknowledged and narrated,\" the Pope said. \"Good cinema does not exploit pain; it recognizes and explores it. This is what all the great directors have done.\"Six months since a conclave of cardinals elected the first North American to the Papacy, some Catholics feel that Leo has been slow to stamp his own mark on the role.His predecessor, Francis, was a charismatic Argentinian known for his off-the-cuff comments and dramatic gestures. Leo's style is far quieter, so this star-studded engagement is a new look.Watch: Among the stars to meet the Pope was Spike Lee who had a unique gift for Leo XIV.It's not clear how the cast list was drawn up, although none of the directors in the hall – who came from all over the world – made it onto the Pope's own top film list.This week, the Vatican revealed that his favourite four watches of all time included the 1960s nun-themed classic The Sound of Music, It's a Wonderful Life and Italian Roberto Benigni's multi award-winning Life is Beautiful.Among those who did join today's A-list audience were Mortensen, Chris Pine and filmmaker Gus Van Sant – of Milk and Good Will Hunting fame. The large Italian contingent included Gianni Amelio and Cinema Paradiso creator, Giuseppe Tornatore.At a time of immense pressure on film, not long after a major Hollywood strike and with funding strains here in Italy, the Pope spoke in defence of the industry.He was applauded loudly when he talked of the \"quiet dedication\" of all those behind the scenes with vital roles.ReutersThe audience for the international filmmakers was held beneath the magnificent frescoes of the Clementine Hall He also warned against the closure of cinemas which he characterised as the \"beating heart of communities\".\"More than a few people are saying that the art of cinema and the cinematic experience are in danger. I urge institutions not to give up, but to cooperate in affirming the social and cultural value of this activity,\" the Pope said.After a fifteen-minute speech and a blessing he then received each audience member in turn, led by Blanchett.\"He really urged us to go back into our day jobs and inspire people,\" the Australian-born star told reporters.One of many who came bearing gifts, the actress – who works with the UN refugee agency, UNHCR – placed a woven bracelet in the Pope's hand. \"It was a bracelet I wear in solidarity with people who are displaced,\" she explained later.Lee handed the Chicago-born Pope a New York Knicks shirt printed with the number 14 and the words Pope Leo.",

    "body": "1 day agoDanielle Kaye,Business reporter and Nardine SaadUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order allowing a range of food products, including coffee, bananas and beef, to escape his sweeping tariffs.The move comes as his administration faces mounting pressure over rising prices. While Trump previously downplayed concerns about the cost of living, he has focused on the issue since his Republican Party's poor performance in last week's elections.The dozens of products included on the White House's list of exemptions range from avocados and tomatoes to coconuts and mangoes.These goods, the Trump administration said on Friday, cannot be produced in sufficient quantities domestically.Trump has long said that his tariffs - currently a baseline 10% on imports from all countries, with additional levies on many trading partners - would not lead to increased prices for US consumers. He also said affordability was a \"new word\" and a \"con job\" by Democrats.He has argued the taxes are necessary to reduce the US trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods it buys from other countries and those it sells to them. Trump has said the US has been exploited by \"cheaters\" and \"pillaged\" by foreigners, adding that higher levies would encourage those in the US to buy American goods instead. But grocery costs and the soaring price of beef has become a political issue for Trump. Last week, he called for an investigation into the meat-packing industry, accusing companies of \"Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation\".He has aimed to rally support for the taxes, offering $2,000 tariff rebate cheques to Americans - even as the US Supreme Court is currently weighing whether Trump had the legal authority to implement them.  But the latest exemptions signal a reversal by the Trump administration, as the White House seeks to lower prices by walking back levies on some food staples.Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said the decision will affect products that are not produced in the US, \"so there's no protection of our industries, or our food products\".He added that he doesn't think more policy rollbacks will be required in the future, saying \"I don't think it'll be necessary.\" \"We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods, like coffee as an example, where the prices of coffee were a little bit high. Now they'll be on the low side in a very short period of time,\" Trump said.Economists have warned that companies would pass the cost of tariffs onto their customers in the form of higher prices.While inflation remained milder than many analysts had expected in September, most items tracked in the Department of Labor inflation report showed price increases, with groceries up 2.7% from last year.The Trump administration's new tariff exemptions for food products take effect retroactively at midnight on Thursday 13 November, the White House said.In another move to address concerns among consumers about grocery prices, the Trump administration said import taxes on coffee and bananas will be lowered as part of trade deals with four Latin American countries.This week, Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both vowed to decrease coffee prices by 20% in the US this year.The White House released a list that includes more than 100 products no longer subject to the levies. Some of them include: CoffeeCocoaBlack teaGreen teaVanilla beansBeef products, including high-quality cuts, bone-in and boneless cuts, corned beef, some frozen items, as well as salted, brined, dried or smoked meatFruits, including acai, avocadoes, bananas, coconuts, guavas, limes, oranges, mangoes, plantains, pineapples, various peppers and tomatoesSpices, including allspice, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, curry, dill fennel seeds, ginger, mace, nutmeg, oregano, paprika, saffron and turmericNuts, grains, roots and seeds, such as barley, Brazil nuts, capers, cashews, chestnuts, macadamia nuts, miso, palm hearts, pine nuts, poppy seeds, tapioca, taro and water chestnuts",

    "body": "The US will help South Korea build nuclear 'attack' submarines - here's what that means5 hours agoJake Kwon,Seoul and Gavin Butler,SingaporeReutersFile photo of a nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarineSouth Korea's government has announced that it has finalised an agreement to build nuclear-powered submarines in partnership with the United States.The US has approved the \"attack submarines\" and agreed to cooperate in sourcing fuel, according to a fact sheet released by the White House on Thursday.The agreement marks a significant step in South Korea's relations with the US and comes amid a period of growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula: with the nuclear-armed North Korea, and an expansionist China to the west.Here's what you need to know about the agreement. What's in the agreement? The agreement between the US and South Korea comes as leaders from both countries reached a broad trade deal earlier last month that would see reciprocal tariffs cut to 15% from 25%. US President Donald Trump had slapped a tariff rate on Seoul of 25% earlier this year - which his counterpart Lee Jae Myung managed to negotiate down to 15%, after Seoul said it would invest $350bn (£265bn) in the US, including $200bn in cash investment and $150bn in shipbuilding.In a White House readout released on Thursday, the US said it had \"given approval for the Republic of Korea to build nuclear-powered attack submarines... [and would] work closely to advance requirements for this project, including avenues to source fuel\".In an earlier post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump had said the vessels would be constructed at a shipyard in Philadelphia run by South Korean conglomerate Hanwha.Only six countries currently possess nuclear-powered strategic submarines: the US, China, Russia, the UK, France and India.South Korea already possesses about 20 submarines, but they are all diesel propelled and therefore need to surface far more frequently. Nuclear submarines are also able to operate further and faster.\"I have given them approval to build a nuclear-powered submarine, rather than the old-fashioned, and far less nimble, diesel-powered submarines that they have now,\" Trump had wrote on Truth Social.South Korea is a powerhouse when it comes to civilian nuclear energy. It had a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s but gave it up following US pressure. And so its ability to enrich or reprocess uranium is limited by the US as it is entirely dependent on imports. Why does South Korea want nuclear submarines? The latest vessel programme is aimed at countering North Korea, which recently revealed that it was pursuing its own nuclear submarine programme.President Lee had told Trump at the APEC summit last month that South Korea needed them for that express purpose.In a TV interview last week, Ahn Gyu-back, South Korea's Minister of Defence, said that nuclear submarines would be a \"proud achievement\" for South Korea, and a major leap in strengthening the country's defence against the North.The stealth of nuclear submarines would keep North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"awake at night\", he added. Getty ImagesUS President Donald Trump met his Korean counterpart in South Korea last monthDoes North Korea have nuclear submarines?North Korea has also been pursuing a nuclear submarine programme – possibly with Russia's help, according to South Korean officials.In March 2025, North Korea unveiled pictures of what it claimed was a nuclear-powered submarine that was under construction, showing Kim visiting the shipyard. Pyongyang is expected to have the submarines within the next few years.North Korea is also estimated to have an arsenal of approximately 50 nuclear weapons, as part of its broader nuclear weapons programme.Jo Bee-yun, a research fellow at the Sejong Institute, suggested that Seoul's acquisition of nuclear submarines will help it stay apace in East Asia's escalating arms race.\"North Korea's nuclear weapon is an established fact,\" she told the BBC. \"[South Korea acquiring] nuclear submarines is only a step in the larger trend of rising tension.\"Will this inflame tensions on the Korean Peninsula?It is unclear how much the nuclear-propelled submarines will contribute to South Korea's defence capabilities – and though they are very expensive, they don't quite change the balance of power on the Korean Peninsula, according to some experts.Yang Uk, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, told the BBC that the nuclear subs' primary purpose is to assure South Korean voters that their government is responding to North Korea's nuclear threat.\"South Korea cannot develop its own nuclear weapons to counter North Korea's,\" Dr Yang said. \"What's something that they can do? Fielding nuclear submarines.\"Dr Yang believes North Korea might revel in the change, however, because it reinforces their justification to hold on to nuclear weapons – meaning it will become more difficult to demand that Pyongyang give up its nuclear arsenal.Jo nonetheless emphasised the strategic advantage that South Korea stands to gain from the new submarine deal, describing it as a \"major change\" which \"means South Korea is now a regional player\". \"The best feature of a nuclear submarine is its speed,\" she said. \"It can now go fast and far and South Korea can operate together with more countries.\"What's in it for the United States?For Washington, support for South Korea's nuclear-powered submarine programme likely aims to put pressure on both North Korea and China.\"Trump has put the burden of defence spending on the back of South Korea,\" Dr Yang explained. \"South Korea will greatly expand its defence budget. They will act as America's proxy in putting pressure on China and North Korea.\"Getty ImagesDonald Trump is attempting to counter the influence of other nations in South Korea, according to expertsUS and China have long competed for strategic influence in South Korea, leaving Seoul to walk a geopolitical tightrope. More recently, China has been increasing its naval activity near South Korea's maritime border – a move akin to those seen in the South China Sea.Beijing must be \"furious\" about South Korea's nuclear submarine agreement with the US, Dr Yang said.Following the deal's announcement, the Chinese Ambassador to South Korea, Dai Bing, said he hoped South Korea would \"deal with this issue prudently, taking into consideration the concerns of all sides\".Dai also added that Beijing was engaging with Seoul on the matter through diplomatic channels, and emphasised that \"the (security) situation on the Korean Peninsula and in the region is still complex and sensitive\".What next?Although President Trump said the submarines would be built in Philadelphia and bring jobs to the US, South Korean officials have maintained they must be built locally, where existing facilities can deliver them in a much shorter timeline.South Korea's Prime Minister Kim Min-seok had himself said during a parliamentary hearing that the South Korean owned shipyard in Philadelphia did \"not have the capability\" to build such vessels, according to reports. Hanwha, who owns the shipyard, has yet to comment on the matter. But now that an agreement has been reached, the next step is to adjust the nuclear agreement between the two countries, allowing for the US to provide nuclear fuel and to set the fence for its military use.",

    "body": "'We're just going to go through this again': Americans fear second government shutdownBeth Johnson is accustomed to the uncertainty that comes with being a military wife - picking up and moving her family every three years. The crippling anxiety that comes with a US government shutdown, however, is not something she is used to.She is one of the millions of Americans who sighed a deep breath of relief when politicians in Washington agreed to reopen the government earlier this week.At 43 days, it was the longest shutdown in US history. But that relief could be short-lived, as the funding agreement expires at the end of January, when Congress will face the same spending challenge once again. \"It really affects every part of your life when your family’s sole source of income comes from the federal government,” Ms Johnson said. \"The uncertainty is crippling.\" \"Government, just do your job\" - Frustration at airports as shutdown delays continueThe Tennessee mother of two has lived in seven states since her husband joined the military nearly 20 years ago. Picking up and moving her family every three years means it is tough for her - and other service members' spouses - to get work, so the Johnson family lives on one paycheque. Not knowing whether or not military service members would receive their paycheques from the shuttered government left her family with difficult decisions. Some 1.3 million active-duty personnel are required to serve during government shutdowns potentially without pay, but the Trump administration stepped in twice during the autumn shutdown to reallocate funds for those servicemembers.But without certainty, many families had to tighten their belts. One of Ms Johnson’s sons even offered to get fewer Christmas Gifts - “it’s ok we don’t need them,” he said to his mother. Ms Johnson is frustrated by what she described as unnecessary sacrifice from millions of Americans.“What was it all for? Why were we suffering for over 40 days in uncertainty, not knowing what was going to happen,\" she questioned. \"What was the point? We’re just going to go through this again probably in January.”The agreement Congress made this week funds the government for the next two months, guarantees that all federal workers will be paid for time during the shutdown, and funds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) - which provides food aid to one in eight Americans - until next September.Sierra Bird is one of the more than 42 million Americans who depend on funds from Snap to feed her family.The Florida mother of four gets about $900 a month, but those funds were delayed because they were caught up in the spending bill.Ms Bird said she \"survived\" the shutdown and her Snap card will be reloaded over the weekend. She'll return to some sense of normal, but she's also weary another shutdown could be on the horizon and she said she would start stockpiling food, just in case.\"People are going to take what they need if they don't have what they need,\" Ms Bird said. \"Don't mess with people's food.\"While Snap benefits have resumed, one thing that hasn't come back is health-insurance subsidies. It was those subsidies that Democrats had said they were willing to fight for, which helped fuel the shutdown in the first place. Democrats had said they would not approve the budget unless the subsidies continued. But on Tuesday, eight Democrats sided with Republicans to approve a spending plan without them.\"I swapped one stress for another,\" Ms Bird said. \"I would rather have the affordable healthcare than Snap, because I can feed them rice and beans and survive, but I need my medications.\"In addition to those struggling to put food on the table during the shutdown, more than 1.4 million federal employees went without pay for 43 days.Sarah, a Utah Interior Department employee who asked her last name not be used, was among them. She was furloughed from the start of the shutdown on 1 October and as the days and weeks went by she worried she would have to find another way to make money.\"I was trying to decide if I wanted to give up the federal sector altogether to find another career,\" Sarah said. As an archaeologist, she works in a unique, specialised role, making it hard to transfer her expertise to another job or industry.Her worries were quelled on Thursday when she returned to work for the first time in weeks, following the government's reopening, but she is already preparing for the prospect of another one come January. \"With the holidays coming up, I'm not going to spending a whole lot of money,\" she said, noting she is putting off certain remodelling projects too. \"I would not be the least bit surprised if another shutdown happened.\"In the less than 80 days until the next potential government shutdown, Ms Johnson, the military wife, said she would be preparing, just in case. \"We're making a huge effort to watch unnecessary spending and save money where we can so we have a bigger nest egg built up because if the government shuts down again in January there's no guarantee that active duty military is going to get paid.\"",

    "body": "A bus driver arrested after three people were killed and another three injured in a crash in Stockholm on Friday has been released.Authorities are continuing to investigate the circumstances of the incident after a bus crashed into a bus stop queue on Valhallavägen street in the Swedish capital.The Swedish Prosecution Authority said on Saturday there was \"no reason\" to keep the driver, who had been questioned by police, in custody but that \"certain investigative measures remain\".The man had been arrested on suspicion of three counts of causing death and three of causing bodily harm. Police said there was no reason to think the incident was intentional. Officials are still trying to establish the identities of the victims. The bus was not in service at the time and no passengers were on board, local media report. The crash happened near the Royal Institute of Technology university at about 15:23 (14:23 GMT).Images from the scene show rescue crews appearing to help people trapped underneath the double-decker bus.A witness who owns a shop on the street told SVT the bus hit a pole in front of the bus shelter. They said several people ran into the shop crying.A woman told the local Expressen newspaper that the bus \"mowed down an entire bus stop queue\". She said people were screaming and trying to help the injured, while dead people lay on the ground.\"There must have been more people under the bus,\" she said.Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said his thoughts were with the victims and their families.\"People who might have been on their way home to family, friends, or a quiet evening at home. We do not yet know the cause, but right now my thoughts are primarily with those affected and their loved ones,\" he posted on X.",

The explosion happened on Friday evening at Nowgam police station, and the explosives were seized from Faridabad in the northern state of Haryana earlier in the week. The region's director general of police, Nalin Prabhat, said the explosives were being sent for forensic examination - but due to a \"very unfortunate\" mishap during handling they detonated at around 23:20 local time (17:50 GMT).Police said in a statement that it was an accidental detonation, not a terrorist attack. \"Any other speculation into the cause of this incident is unnecessary,\" the police chief told journalists.The police station suffered severe damage in the explosion and adjacent buildings were also affected, he said.Multiple vehicles were \"engulfed in flames and reduced to charred husks, with debris scattered across the site\", according to a police statement. \"The intensity of the blast was such that some body parts were recovered from nearby houses, around 100-200 metres away from the police station,\" a source told Reuters news agency. Most of the victims were police officers, along with forensic personnel, two crime scene photographers, and a tailor who was with the team. Manoj Sinha, the region's Lieutenant Governor appointed by the Indian government, expressed his condolences and said he had ordered an investigation. \"I have ordered a probe to ascertain the cause of the accidental explosion. Deeply anguished by the loss of precious lives due to extremely tragic accidental blast at Nowgam police station in Srinagar. My condolences to the bereaved families. I pray for speedy recovery of the injured,\" he wrote on social media.",

    "body": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has vowed to \"overhaul\" state-owned energy companies, after a major corruption scandal engulfed the country's energy sector.Around $100 million (£76m) has been embezzled, anti-graft investigators said, causing outrage in a country where Russian attacks have resulted in crippling power outages.\"Alongside a full audit of their financial activities, the management of these companies is to be renewed,\" Zelensky wrote in a post on X on Saturday. Energoatom, the state nuclear company at the heart of the scandal, will have a new supervisory board \"within a week,\" he added. Several of those implicated in the scandal have close links to the Ukrainian president.The scandal is unfolding against the backdrop of escalating Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities, including substations that supply electricity to nuclear power plants.\"I have also instructed government officials to maintain constant and meaningful communication with law enforcement and anti-corruption bodies,\" Zelensky wrote. He also called for the quick appointment of a new head of Ukrhydroenergo, a hydropower generating company, and reforms for oil and gas giant Naftogaz and the nation's Gas Transmission System Operator. Two ministers were forced to resign over the corruption scheme and a former business partner of Zelensky was sanctioned earlier this week when the scandal broke.On Monday, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (Nabu) and Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap) said the 15 month-long investigation had revealed several members of the Ukrainian government were involved.Some of those implicated in the scandal are or have been, close associates of Zelensky's. Among those alleged to be involved are Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko, former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov and Timur Mindich - a businessman and a co-owner of Zelensky's former TV studio Kvartal95.Zelensky has previously said he is committed to fully cooperate with the anti-corruption investigation.\"I have also instructed government officials to maintain constant and meaningful communication with law enforcement and anti-corruption bodies,\" he said on Saturday.\"The full transparency and integrity in the energy sector remain an absolute priority.\"But the scandal has brought Zelensky's commitment to fighting corruption under scrutiny once again. In July, he faced backlash after he signed a law limiting the independence of Nabu and Sap. The outrage was only quelled by Zelensky's decision to reinstate their freedom, but the debacle prompted criticism from European allies including France and Germany, while ambassadors from the G7 group of nations expressed the desire to discuss the issue with the Ukrainian leadership.",

    "body": "A major data breach in Somalia's electronic visa system may have exposed personal information belonging to tens of thousands of applicants, including US citizens, the American embassy in Somalia has warned.It said it had received credible reports that \"unidentified hackers\" had penetrated the Somali government's e-visa platform, potentially compromising data from at least 35,000 people.The leaked documents circulating online include names, photos, dates of birth, marital status, home addresses and email contacts, according to a US embassy statement issued on Thursday.\"This data breach is ongoing and could expose any personal data you enter into the system,\" the UK has also warned travellers.\"Consider the risks before applying for an e-visa required for travel to Somalia.\"Somali authorities have not commented on the breach. But the government has shifted its visa service from evisa.gov.so to etas.gov.so, without providing an official explanation.\"While Embassy Mogadishu is unable to confirm whether an individual's data is part of the breach, individuals who have applied for a Somali e-visa may be affected,\" the  US' statement said.The BBC has contacted the Somalia Civil Aviation Authority (SCAA) for comment.Somalia's new system requires all travellers, including those from the self-declared republic of Somaliland and the semi-autonomous region of Puntland, to apply for entry visas online.Critics say travellers have faced extra fees in certain regions, amounting to double charges.Somaliland, which declared independence in 1991, governs itself with its own institutions but has not been internationally recognised. Somalia maintains that the region remains part of its sovereign territory.The alleged breach adds to long-running tensions between Mogadishu and Hargeisa over control of Somali airspace. While Somalia re-established full control of its airspace in 2017, Somaliland continues to contest the arrangement.The dispute escalated further this week when Somaliland's President Abdirahman Irro said Somaliland would not accept Somalia's e-visa and ordered that airlines must obtain clearance from Hargeisa before entering its airspace.Yet major airlines have refused to board passengers without Somalia's e-visa approval.On Saturday, Somaliland's Foreign Minister Abdirahman Dahir Aadan again insisted that \"anyone travelling to Somaliland will obtain their visa on arrival\", saying Somalia's e-visa system was not safe and warning that \"people's data can fall into the hands of extremist groups\" as a result of using it.The stand-off has left some travellers heading to Somaliland stranded at airports after being denied boarding for lacking Somalia's e-visa.Somaliland's Civil Aviation Minister, Fu'aad Ahmed Nuux, has told the BBC that the directives - first announced earlier this year - came into effect on 10 November.He said airlines that do not comply will be told to divert, and claimed several aircraft had already been rerouted.Footage released by Somaliland's aviation ministry appears to show local air-traffic controllers issuing instructions to international pilots - a move celebrated domestically as an assertion of Somaliland's autonomy.But the Somalia Civil Aviation Authority insists it retains sole administrative and legal control over the Mogadishu Flight Information Region (FIR), which covers the whole nation's airspace. It has ordered all aircraft to ignore any instructions issued by authorities other than Mogadishu.It warned that failing to comply with Somali and international aviation rules could pose safety risks and lead to \"serious legal consequences\".Additional reporting by Natasha Booty.",

    "body": "4 hours agoNikita YadavBBC News, DelhiFor millions across northern India, the November air tastes ashy, the sky looks visibly hazy and merely stepping outside feels like a challenge.For many, their morning routine starts with checking how bad the air is. But what they see depends entirely on which monitor they use. Government-backed apps like SAFAR and SAMEER top out at 500 - the upper limit of India's AQI (air quality index) scale, which converts complex data on various pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone, into a single number. But private and international trackers such as IQAir and open-source monitoring platform AQI routinely show far higher numbers, often shooting past 600 and even crossing 1,000 on some days.This contradiction leaves people asking the same question every year: Which numbers should they trust? And why doesn't India officially report air quality beyond 500?India's official air-quality scale shows readings above 200 pose clear breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. Readings above 400 and up to 500 are classified as \"severe\" and affect healthy people while also seriously impacting those with existing diseases. The scale however does not go beyond 500 -  a cap set more than a decade ago when the National Air Quality Index was launched.So why was that threshold introduced?\"It was assumed that the health impact would be the same no matter how much higher it goes because we had already hit the worst,\" says Gufran Beig, founder director of SAFAR. He admits that the 500 cap was originally set to avoid creating panic as crossing that mark signalled an alarming situation requiring immediate mitigation.But this approach effectively flattens the data - anything above 500 is treated the same on official monitors, even if the real concentration is far higher.\"International organisations and portals don't impose such a cap,\" says Mr Beig. \"That's why we see numbers going much higher on global platforms.\"The BBC has reached out to India's pollution control board for a comment.Beyond the artificially imposed threshold, there's also a difference in defining hazardous air.For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines classify PM2.5 levels - particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers - above 15 micrograms per cubic metre in a 24-hour period as hazardous, while in India, the threshold is 60 micrograms.Experts say that globally, there's no universal AQI formula. US, China and the European Union each apply their own pollutant thresholds.\"WHO provides guidelines and every country has built its index based on its own adaptability, weather and local environment,\" says Mr Beig. Comparing India's AQI to WHO or US standards can thus be misleading. Then there is also a difference in the instruments used. The Indian pollution control board uses Beta Attenuation Monitors (BAMs), which physically measure the mass of particles in the air and are calibrated to strict, standardised metrics for every reading.In contrast, portals like IQAir rely on sensor-based monitors, says Abhijeet Pathak, a scientist who formerly worked for India's pollution control board.Sensor-based monitors use laser scattering and electrochemical methods to estimate the number of particles suspended in the air.\"The sensor is a different tool and it is not possible to calibrate them for every run,\"  says Mr Pathak, adding that \"sensor-based air quality monitoring has not yet been approved by the Indian government\".According to him, India's air quality framework hasn't been comprehensively revised since 2009, and he, along with other environmental scientists and activists have called for recalibrating the scale based on the latest technology.\"National Air Quality index will need to be revised if we want to include the sensor-based data,\" says Mr Pathak. Removing the upper cap is also crucial says Mr Beig, \"now that most literature available shows health symptoms keep on worsening as the pollution levels increase\". In the end, India's AQI doesn't stop at 500 because the pollution stops there. It stops at 500 because the system was built with a ceiling.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "11 hours agoNatasha Booty and BBC World Service NewsroomRwandan-backed M23 rebels and the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo have signed a framework for peace in the east of the country. The ceremony was held in Qatar, which along with the US and the African Union, has been trying to mediate an end to decades of conflict in the resource-rich region.Earlier this year, the M23 captured the eastern region's main cities of Goma and Bukavu. Previous attempts to secure peace have failed.The US's Africa envoy Massad Boulos said the document covered eight protocols and that most still required work. He also acknowledged that prisoner exchanges and ceasefire monitoring had been slower than originally hoped. Kinshasa is demanding the withdrawal of Rwandan troops from its territory. Kigali says this can happen once the Congo-based FDLR rebel militia is disbanded. It is largely made up of ethnic Hutus linked to the 1994 Rwandan genocide.The new framework also addresses humanitarian access, the return of displaced people and protection of the judiciary, Boulous is quoted as saying by the AFP agency.It builds on a declaration of principles signed by the two sides in Doha in July, as well as a deal made in the same city last month on the monitoring of an eventual ceasefire.Before that, in June, talks between Rwanda and DR Congo brokered by Washington resulted in the signing of a peace deal that was hailed by US President Donald Trump as a \"a glorious triumph\" but was swiftly violated by the warring parties.The M23 is one of the biggest parties in this conflict, but was not directly involved in the US-brokered ceasefire deal. It has always favoured the talks mediated by Qatar, saying they will address \"the root causes\" of the conflict.Decades of conflict escalated in January when M23 rebels seized control of large parts of eastern DR Congo including the regional capital, Goma, the city of Bukavu and two airports.Since January, thousands of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands of civilians forced from their homes.After the loss of territory, the government in Kinshasa had turned to the US for help, reportedly offering access to critical minerals in exchange for security guarantees. Eastern DR Congo is rich in coltan and other resources vital to the global electronics industries.Rwanda denies supporting the M23, despite overwhelming evidence, and insists its military presence in the region is a defensive measure against threats posed by armed groups like the FDLR.",

    "body": "4 hours agoLinda Pressly and Esperanza Escribano,BarcelonaBBCMarina Freixa always knew there was something dark and unspoken about her family.Her mother had grown up under Spain's decades-long dictatorship, which ended in 1975, but the details of her childhood were hazy.Then everything changed one Christmas a decade ago - when Marina was about 20.That winter's evening around the table, with a cloud of cigarette smoke suspended in the air and wine glasses drained, Marina's mother, Mariona Roca Tort, began to speak.Els Buits (documentary film)Several years ago, Mariona (left) revealed the truth about her adolescence to Marina and her cousins\"My parents reported me to the authorities,\" Mariona told them. \"They put me in a reformatory when I was 17.\"Reformatories were institutions where girls and young women who refused to conform to the Franco regime's Catholic values were detained - single mothers, girls with boyfriends, lesbians. Girls who'd been sexually assaulted were incarcerated, assuming the blame for their own abuse. Orphans and abandoned girls might also find themselves living behind convent walls.Marina and her cousins were stunned.They couldn't comprehend that their grandparents had arranged to have their own daughter locked up.Mariona's memory of telling this story to the youngsters in her family is blurred, she believes as a result of the psychiatric \"treatment\" she was forced to undergo at the reformatory. But Marina didn't forget the revelations, and years later, she would make a documentary telling her mother's story.Mariona is a survivor of the Patronato de Protección a la Mujer - the Women's Protection Board. Under dictator Francisco Franco, it oversaw a nationwide network of residential institutions managed by religious organisations. There's no definitive information about how many institutions were involved or how many girls were affected.Thursday will mark 50 years since Franco's death. Spain has since seen a revolution in women's rights - but survivors of the Patronato are still waiting for answers and are now demanding an inquiry.Family handoutAs a teenager, Mariona encountered people resisting the Spanish dictatorshipWarning: This article contains content that some readers might find distressingMariona, the oldest of nine siblings, describes her parents as right-wing and ultra-Catholic. They were so conservative they wouldn't even let Mariona wear trousers.But in 1968, when she turned 16, a new world unfolded.Mariona was tutoring children during the day, and preparing for university at evening classes. There, she says, she met people she'd never encountered before - trade unionists, left-wingers and anti-Franco activists. It was the year of global protests against authoritarianism and the Vietnam War, with mass demands for civil rights. The spirit of revolt was infectious.Franco had been in power for three decades. Political parties were banned, censorship was universal and young people wanted change. Soon, Mariona joined her new friends on \"raids\": a few of them would block off a street, throw Molotov cocktails, hand out leaflets, and when the police turned up, scatter in every direction.On May Day 1969, one of Mariona's friends was arrested at a demonstration in Barcelona. There was a risk the detainee would give names to the police - so Mariona couldn't go home, in case they came looking for her. That night she stayed in the flat of a fellow activist.Returning home the next day, Mariona was in deep trouble. Her parents were furious, and began to exert far more control over her life.\"For them, it was a scandal, a stain on the family,\" she says. \"After that, they wouldn't let me out.\"By the end of that summer, Mariona had resolved to leave home, and travelled to the holiday island of Menorca with some college friends, leaving her parents a note.They immediately reported her as an underage runaway to the authorities, and the moment Mariona was about to board a boat back to Barcelona, she was arrested.AlamyMariona's escape from Barcelona in 1969 was short-livedAt the port in Barcelona her parents met her.They didn't take her home. Instead, they took her to a convent. Mariona wasn't given any explanation - she only remembers her parents' rage.Days later she flew to Madrid with her father. There, she was driven directly to another convent, part of the Patronato system, under Spain's Ministry of Justice.She and the other interned women were categorised and segregated.Mariona says she ended up on the first floor - reserved for \"the rebellious ones - the ones they considered fallen women\".The Patronato had the power to detain any non-conforming woman under 25. They weren't criminals - they were females deemed in need of \"re-education\".  But Mariona never learned the stories of the others she was confined with.\"They didn't let us talk.  It's quite incredible,\" she says. \"And you wonder, how did they manage it?\"The internees were only allowed to exchange simple greetings with each other - a form of control, and a way of preventing \"bad\" girls influencing others.\"What you couldn't do was really get to know another girl,\"  says Mariona. \"Because then they'd separate you - send one of you to a different dormitory, or even to another institution.\"She thinks there were around 100 internees at the convent. They slept 20 to a room, with a nun at one end, and the door locked. The daily routine was gruelling - prayers, Mass, cleaning the convent, and then hours in a workshop making clothes for local retailers. While the girls sewed, a nun read aloud so that no-one talked.\"There was indoctrination,\" recalls Mariona. \"So that you should understand you'd behaved very badly. Then once you realised this, you'd ask for forgiveness and confess.\"Mariona never confessed.Marina FreixaIn her diary, Mariona wrote: \"Father says I must choose. Live a proper family life, or leave home forever.\"After around four months, she was allowed to return home to Barcelona for Christmas, but wasn't permitted to go out alone. Somehow - and Mariona doesn't remember how - she managed to escape, but her escape was short lived. Within hours she was bundled into a car with her father and an uncle, and driven back to Madrid.\"We arrived back at the convent at dusk,\" she recalls. \"I refused to go in. They pulled me up the stairs and gave me a sedative to get me inside.\"Inside the convent, the other young women were warned against talking to her - the rebel girl who had the nerve to try to run away. She grew intensely lonely, and eventually began refusing food.Dramatic weight loss resulted in her admission to a psychiatric clinic. There, she says she was given two sessions of electric shock treatment, followed by what was called \"insulin coma therapy\".Mariona says she was injected with insulin to induce deep hypoglycemia - a coma-like state caused by low blood sugar. It was believed this could reduce psychotic or schizophrenic symptoms, and somehow \"re-set\" a patient's brain. It was a \"therapy\" that was being discontinued in many countries for one simple reason: it could be lethal.Mariona received an insulin injection in the mornings. Later she'd be brought out of the coma and made to eat. Mentally, she began to shut down.\"Everyday, I was more dazed. I started saying things like, 'I hurt my parents,'\" she says.\"I entered this process of submission and acceptance.\"Mariona believes the forced, intravenous \"treatment\" with insulin irreparably damaged her memory. Suspecting it was causing her to forget things, she began keeping a diary. More than five decades later, this faded, paper document from 1971 would inform Marina's documentary about her mother's experience.Doctors believed the \"treatment\" would help Mariona gain weight - but that wasn't happening. \"One day, the psychiatrist decided it was better to try tying me to the bed until I ate.\"Mariona's despair became so unbearable, she says she thought about taking her own life. Then the psychiatrist gave her a target weight of 40kg (6st 4lb). If she achieved that, they promised she'd be released from the clinic.Mariona Roca TortWhen Mariona was released from the Patronato, she never returned to live with her parents againMariona succeeded. In 1972, once she'd grown a little stronger, she returned to Barcelona.Now aged 20, she vowed to never live with her parents again.These were the final years of Franco's dictatorship before his death in 1975. Mariona moved from job to job, eventually forging a career as a TV director. She had children of her own, but her relationship with her parents remained cool.At some point, Mariona asked her mother why she'd been sent to the Patronato. Her mother only said: \"We made a mistake.\"Mariona's father is in his 90s now. \"We suffered a lot too,\" he told her when she asked him about the family decision to have her locked up in Madrid.For Marina, learning more about her mother's story has complicated her relationship with her grandfather.\"I can't force myself to love someone who's caused so much pain - who treated my mother very badly.\"The short documentary Marina produced about her mother's experience of the Patronato is called Els Buits - Catalan for \"the spaces\" - a reference to the blanks in Mariona's memory. The film has won prizes in Spain, and was nominated for a prestigious Goya Award.Esperanza EscribanoMariona and Marina are touring with the documentary film, which Marina believes shows the institutions were a \"systematic\" part of Spain's historyFifty years after the death of Franco, the film has contributed to a groundswell of calls for the interned women to be formally recognised under the law as victims of Spain's dictatorship. Spain's Minister for Democratic Memory, Ángel Víctor Torres, said his government was open to looking at the case of the Patronato survivors.Meanwhile, Marina and Mariona are on tour with the film, taking it to community screenings.\"Women come and tell their stories – it's like a door opened to something unknown, and that's very powerful,\" says Marina. \"People think what happened in their own home was an isolated incident. We try to say: this history isn't individual, it was systematic.\"Her mother Mariona still doubts her memory sometimes.But, she says, \"seeing it all reflected in the film, that gives it the weight of truth.\"If you've been affected by issues involving suicide or feelings of despair, details of organisations offering advice and support for people in the UK are available from BBC Action Line.

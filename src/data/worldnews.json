    "body": "14 hours agoJake Horton,Ghoncheh HabibiazadandSarah JalaliBBCCrowds of mourners appear to have been fired on by a security official at a cemetery in Iran.The incident happened in Abdanan, in west Iran, on Tuesday as people gathered to commemorate those killed during the government's brutal crackdown on protesters last month.Iranians usually hold commemoration ceremonies on the 40th day after someone dies. The events have been held in several cities across the country to mourn the thousands killed during the deadliest nights of protests on 8 and 9 January.Verified video also shows people shouting anti-government chants at events in Tehran, Mashhad and Abdanan on Tuesday as crowds gathered at cemeteries and in the streets for commemorations.State-organised ceremonies were broadcast on TV and attended by senior government and military officials where people were led by organisers to chant \"death to America\".BBC Verify and BBC Persian have verified footage of people chanting \"death to Khamenei\", referencing Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. An armoured vehicle is then seen driving past the crowd of mourners as an apparent security official opens fire. People are heard screaming and seen fleeing the area as two gunshots ring out.The person who appears to be in uniform is seen pointing the gun away from the camera when the first shot is fired, before pointing the gun towards the crowd when a second shot can be heard. A puff of smoke near the gun is visible after each shot.Another verified video from the cemetery shows smoke in the distance as people run away from the scene and several gunshots can be heard.State-run IRIB News claimed that the event was peaceful and reports of people injured or killed were not true.XA billboard in the background of one the videos shows a picture of Alireza Seydi, a teenager from Abdanan who was understood to have been killed during the protests in Tehran last month and appears to be one of those commemorated during the ceremony.Weeks of anti-government protests started in late December which began over the economy but rapidly escalated. It peaked on 8 and 9 January after Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late shah, called for nationwide protests to take place. Thousands of people were killed in one of the deadliest government crackdowns in recent years. BBC Verify previously reported that it had spread to more than 68 towns and cities across the country.Khamenei last month acknowledged that thousands had been killed during the protests and blamed the US for the deaths.Additional reporting by Daniele Palumbo and Shayan Sardarizadeh",

    "body": "16 hours agoRobert GreenallGetty ImagesSpanish police have arrested a 20-year-old man suspected of hacking a hotel booking website and reserving luxury rooms priced at up to €1,000 ($1,180; £870) per night for just one euro cent.He was detained while staying at a Madrid hotel, where he was accused of racking up charges of more than €20,000 during several stays.Police said the alleged crime involved altering the payment validation system, and was the first of its kind to be detected.Their investigation began after suspicious activity was reported by a travel booking site. It took just four days to complete - the Spanish outlet ABC reported that the suspect used his real identity to make the reservations.According to police, the suspect is believed to have sabotaged the payment system via a cyber attack, getting the system to authorise his transaction after entering only one cent as the charged amount.Police said that the transaction had at first appeared to have been carried out correctly. The irregularity was only discovered when the payment platform transferred the actual amount - €0.01 - to the hotel company.Four days later, police located the suspect at the Madrid hotel and arrested him. His latest stay there was for four nights, normally costing €4,000. They said the man had also consumed mini-bar items during his stays and left other bills unpaid.The police statement appears to suggest that bookings had been made at other hotels, though no details were given.ABC reported that the suspect had previously been arrested in the Canary Islands, where he had also stayed at a luxury hotel.",

    "body": "23 hours agoYang TianGetty ImagesPeru's Congress has ousted interim President José Jerí just four months after he took office for failing to disclose meetings with Chinese businessmen.The scandal unfolded last month after videos emerged of Jerí meeting several times outside his official schedule with businessman Zhihua Yang, who was under government scrutiny.Jerí had previously apologised for the meetings, but denied any wrongdoing and accused his rivals of a public smear campaign.His removal from office makes him the third consecutive president to be ousted, after he replaced former leader Dina Boluarte, who was impeached in October last year.Jerí was Peru's seventh president since 2016 amid a tumultuous political landscape that has seen a succession of leaders leave the post under contentious circumstances.While lawmakers had set a date to discuss impeaching Jerí, in the end they opted for a different parliamentary procedure called censure, which only required a simple majority to pass rather than the super majority needed for an impeachment.Later on Wednesday, Congress will name a new interim president who will serve only for a few months - until a new president is chosen by the people in a general election this April. Jerí had come under fire following a series of controversies dubbed \"Chifa-gate\" - after a local name for Chinese-Peruvian fusion food and the restaurants which serve it.Security camera footage of Jerí's meetings with Yang, who owns several businesses and was granted a state concession for an energy project, was first reported by local media.In one of the videos, Jerí could be seen wearing a hooded top during a late-night visit at one of Yang's restaurants.Also present at one of the meetings was another Chinese citizen who was under house arrest while being investigated for alleged links to an illegal timber network.Peruvian law requires presidents to document all their official activities, but Jerí did not record those meetings.Jerí faced further criticism after it emerged that state contracts had been awarded  to a number of women following late-night meetings they had with him in the presidential palace.Ruth Luque, one of the lawmakers who backed the censure measure, said she wanted a leader who would put public interest and security first.\"We ask to end this agony so we can truly create the transition citizens are hoping for,\" she said, according to Reuters news agency. \"Not a transition with hidden interests, influence-peddling, secret meetings and hooded figures. We don't want that sort of transition.\"Pressure had been mounting for Jerí to resign in the wake of the scandals as he faced a corruption investigation launched by the attorney general and his approval ratings plummeted.His removal marks another chapter of instability for Peru, which is due to hold a general election in April, after which power will be transferred to a new president.Less than a week after Jerí assumed power, protests organised by young Peruvians demanding the political class to do more to combat crime and corruption left one dead and more than 100 people injured.Correction 18 February: An earlier version of this article said José Jerí had been impeached as Peru's president. This was later updated to say he had been ousted by Congress to better reflect the parliamentary procedure used to remove him from office.",

    "body": "Do not give away Diego Garcia, Trump tells UK in fresh attack on Chagos deal10 hours agoJaroslav LukivGettyThe US had previously supported the UK's decision to proceed with the Chagos deal\"Do not give away Diego Garcia,\" US President Donald Trump has said as he criticised the UK's plan to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and lease back an important military base.Trump said \"this land should not be taken away from the UK\" and if it did it would be \"a blight on our Great Ally\", in a post on social media. In response to Trump, the UK Foreign Office said the Chagos Islands deal was \"crucial to the security of the UK and our key allies, and to keeping the British people safe\".\"The agreement we have reached is the only way to guarantee the long-term future of this vital military base,\" it said in a statement.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously insisted the deal is necessary to protect the continued operation of the base, amid previous attempts from Mauritius to dispute the legality of British sovereignty over the islands.Diego Garcia is the largest island in the archipelago, and is used as a joint military base by the UK and US armed forces.Trump's latest comments come ahead of talks between the US and Mauritius planned for next week.Posting on the Truth Social platform on Wednesday, Trump wrote: \"I have been telling Prime Minister Keir Starmer, of the United Kingdom, that Leases are no good when it comes to Countries, and that he is making a big mistake by entering a 100 Year Lease...\"The US president stressed that Diego Garcia was \"strategically located in the Indian Ocean\".\"Prime Minister Starmer is losing control of this important Island by claims of entities never known of before,\" he said. \"We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the U.K., but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them.\"And referring to ongoing US-Iran talks on Tehran's controversial nuclear programme, Trump said: \"Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia... in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime.\"The Republican president has repeatedly threatened to use military action against Iran over its deadly crackdown on anti-government protests and its nuclear activities. The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something that Tehran has always denied.Asked by the BBC about Trump's latest comments, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"The post should be taken as the policy of the Trump administration, it's coming straight from the horse's mouth.\"When you see it on Truth Social you know it's directly from President Trump, that's the beauty of this president in his transparency and relaying this administration's policies.\"Watch: BBC asks White House about Trump U-turn on Chagos Islands dealIn a statement, it said it \"supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago\".Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said Trump's latest comments was \"an utter humiliation\" for Starmer.\"It's time Starmer finally saw sense, U-turned and scrapped this appalling deal altogether,\" she said.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Trump's latest change in position showed that the UK needed to pursue closer ties with Europe.\"Trump's endless flip-flopping on the Chagos Islands shows why Starmer's approach is doomed to fail,\" Davey wrote in a post on X.\"Britain can't rely on the US while Trump is in the White House. It's time to strengthen our ties with allies we can depend on, starting with our neighbours in Europe.\"In response to the US president's latest post, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage - an outspoken critic of the UK handover plan - praised Trump's criticism of London's handling of the issue.\"Keir Starmer risks alienating our most important ally by giving away the Chagos Islands, the worst deal in British history,\" he wrote on X. \"President Trump is right to say the Prime Minister is making a big mistake. Starmer must cancel this deal.\"Earlier this week, four Chagos islanders - who are opposing the handover deal - landed on the Chagos Islands' remote atoll as part of a protest against the deal.They refused to leave it, despite a threat of eviction by a British maritime patrol.The Chagos Islands – officially known as the British Indian Ocean Territory – are located about 5,799 miles (9,332km) south-east of the UK and about 1,250 miles north-east of Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean.The islands have been under British control since 1814 and were bought by the government for £3m, which led to the establishment of the islands as an overseas territory in 1965.But Mauritius has long argued that it was illegally forced to give the islands away as part of a deal to gain independence.In the late 1960s, Britain invited the US to build a military base on Diego Garcia, forcibly removing thousands of people from their homes in the process.Some of those Chagossians ended up in Mauritius and the Seychelles, but others settled in the UK, mostly in Crawley, West Sussex.",

I'm not sure about the iguanas, where are we going with that one?\" she said during her cross to the breakfast television show Today on Wednesday, apparently in response to comments from the studio hosts.With glazed eyes she then stumbled through the rest of her sports report, mixing up her words as well as the UK and the US, while studio host Karl Stefanovic could be heard laughing in the background.\"Look the cold weather is a thing, right,\" Stevanovic said unprompted afterwards. \"You can't actually move your lips.\"Social media clips of her report prompted mixed reactions from Australians. \"Good on her, nothing wrong with this. You can tell she's having an absolute ball over there,\" said one person on X, while another commented: \"If it's not a health issue, she should be sacked on the spot - very unprofessional.\"Mason, a prominent sports reporter best known for her National Rugby League coverage, appeared again on the Today show on Thursday morning.After she delivered her live report, she told viewers she wanted to \"take a moment, if that's OK, just to apologise\" for her previous appearance.She thanked viewers for messages of concern and continued: \"I'm OK, probably just a little embarrassed. \"Look, I totally misjudged the situation, I shouldn't have had a drink, especially in these conditions, it's cold, we've got altitude, and not having had dinner probably didn't help as well. But I want to take full responsibility, it's not the standard I set myself.\"So in saying that, I'm genuinely really sorry and I'm thanking everyone for those messages I've received as well.\"The Today show host Jenny Azzopardi responded saying \"we know how hard you work, Danika\" while Stefanovic called her a \"legend\".",

    "body": "1 day agoKelly NgGetty ImagesAustralia has barred a citizen linked to the Islamic State (IS) group from the country for up to two years.The person is among the group of 34 Australian women and children who tried to head home after being released from a Syrian camp earlier this week, only to be turned back by Syrian authorities for \"technical reasons\".The ban was issued \"on advice from security agencies\", Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said on Wednesday, adding that the other 33 people do not meet \"required legal thresholds\" to be banned.Canberra has refused to repatriate the group, believed to be made up of the wives, widows and children of IS fighters. There are 23 children among them.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stressed that these families will not receive government support to come back to the country.\"You make your bed, you lie in it,\" he told a press conference on Wednesday.\"These are people who chose to go overseas to align themselves with... a brutal, reactionary ideology that seeks to undermine and destroy our way of life.\"However legal experts have warned the government has an obligation to allow citizens the right of return, and, responding to reports the group had valid Australian passports, Albanese said his government would not \"breach Australian law\".This group in the al-Roj camp in northern Syria is among dozens of Australians who have been held in camps and prisons across the country since 2019, when IS was driven from its final foothold in Syria.Opposition politicians have raised security concerns about the possibility of these Australians' return. \"How can only one member of this group be deemed a risk and the rest somehow okay?\" Liberal Party Senator Jonno Duniam said on Tuesday, offering to help amend laws to bar more of the group.The al-Roj camp is home to more than 2,000 others from 40 different nationalities, mainly women and children. Among them is thought to be Shamima Begum, who was stripped of her British citizenship in 2019 on national security grounds.Speaking to ABC, the camp's director Hakmiyeh Ibrahim made an appeal to all countries that have citizens held in limbo there: \"Take your citizens, take these children and women\".The children especially are growing up surrounded by \"dangerous ideas and ideologies\" in the camp, she said. \"The more time passes, the more complicated the situation becomes.\"Several of these camps have made headlines as the women and children living in them are severely malnourished and lack access to basic resources.Several other foreign governments - including France, the Netherlands, and the UK - have also refused to repatriate most of their citizens still held in Syria.",

    "body": "7 hours agoBrandon DrenonGetty ImagesUS President Donald Trumps met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa at the White House in November, the first such meeting in the country's history The US is preparing to largely withdraw its remaining troops from Syria over the next few months, a senior White House official has told the BBC.The official said the Syrian government had agreed to take the lead combatting terrorism within its borders and US military presence \"at scale\" was no longer required.American troops have been in Syria since 2015, as part of an anti-terrorism campaign to counter the influence of the Islamic State group (IS).The decision came as US President Donald Trump ramps up military presence in the Middle East while tensions mount with Iran.The official noted that the decision to remove the roughly 1,000 remaining troops from Syria is part of a conditions-based transition, and that the US remains ready to respond to any threats in the region.The news comes amid an increased presence of US troops in the region, specifically near Iran. BBC Verify has confirmed the location of aircraft carrier the USS Abraham Lincoln - equipped with guided missile destroyers and dozens of fighter jets - near Iran.The US has also reportedly sent the USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, to the Middle East, expected to arrive in the region within the next three weeks.Senior national security officials told the BBC's US partner CBS News that Trump said the US military would be ready for potential strikes on Iran as soon as  Saturday, though Trump has not yet made a final decision.In Syria, US troops had already departed two bases earlier this year, the al-Tanf garrison in southern Syria and the al-Shaddadi base in the north-east.The movements follow the collapse of the Assad government in 2024, and a weakened Islamic State amid considerable security improvement in Syria.Since then, the Trump administration has sought to strengthen its diplomatic ties with Damascus and increase its partnership with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa.Sharaa visited Trump in the White House in November, the first such visit from a Syrian leader in the country's history.His government has at times clashed with local military groups, but struck a deal in January that would integrate the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces with Syria's armed forces.Secretary of State Marco Rubio met his Syrian counterpart, Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani, last week to discuss maintaining the ceasefire. Rubio also expressed concerns about the continued fight against terrorism.In December, a translator and two members of the Iowa National Guard were killed in an ambush attack by a lone IS gunman in Palmyra, Syria, the Pentagon said. The Trump administration retaliated with a series of raids against IS, called Operation Hawkeye Strike.The BBC's Bernd Debusmann contributed to this report.",

    "body": "6 hours agoAna FaguyGetty ImagesUS billionaire Les Wexner, who is alleged to have played a key role in helping Jeffrey Epstein build his wealth, has described himself as \"naive, foolish and gullible\" for trusting the late sex offender.In a statement to US lawmakers, the former CEO of Victoria's Secret lingerie brand accused Epstein of stealing \"vast sums\" of money from his family when working as his financial adviser.Wexner, who was testifying before a House committee as part of its probe into the Epstein case, has denied any wrongdoing.  He was described as a potential co-conspirator of Epstein's in a 2019 FBI document, but no charges were ever brought against him.Lawmakers accused the billionaire of knowing about the crimes of Epstein but failing to stop them.Wexner was called before the House of Representatives Oversight Committee on Wednesday to answer questions surrounding his relationship with Epstein in the wake of the release of thousands of documents related to the financier's wrongdoing.Members of the committee travelled to Wexner's home state of Ohio for the testimony. A spokesperson for the 88-year-old tycoon told the BBC: \"Mr Wexner honestly answered every question put to him today by the Committee. \"Mr Wexner reiterated that he has no knowledge of, and did not participate in, Epstein's illegal conduct. He stands by that fervently.\"Only Democratic lawmakers attended the deposition. No Republican lawmakers travelled for it, though some of their staff members did attend.\"We should be very clear that there would be no Epstein island, there'd be no Epstein plane, there'd be no money to traffic women and girls,\" congressman Robert Garcia, of California, said. \"Mr Epstein would not be the wealthy man he was without the support of Les Wexner.\"Watch: Watch: Democrats say Les Wexner provided \"financial support\" to Epstein following depositionWexner, in his opening statement, defended those mentions by saying his relationship with Epstein was limited, and denied any knowledge of the convicted sex offender's abuse.\"I was naive, foolish and gullible to put any trust in Jeffrey Epstein,\" he said. \"He was a conman. And while I was conned, I have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide.\"He said he was \"pleased to testify\" and wanted \"to set the record straight\". Wexner also said he had visited Epstein's private island for \"a few hours\" with his family.The pair's relationship dates back to the 1980s and Wexner has said he cut ties after Epstein was accused of sexually abusing children in Florida.Wexner said he later discovered Epstein \"had misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family\", a statement he repeated in his opening remarks.The retail magnate was identified in a 2019 FBI document as a potential co-conspirator. A separate email also said there was \"limited evidence regarding his involvement\".Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche previously said Wexner's name \"appears in the files thousands of times\".Wexner's lawyers recently told the BBC: \"The Assistant US Attorney told Mr Wexner's legal counsel in 2019 that Mr Wexner was being viewed as source of information about Epstein and was not a target in any respect.\"Mr Wexner co-operated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again.\"",

    "body": "15 hours agoKwasi Gyamfi AsieduCourtesy Photo/US Air ForceAn artist rendering of the new plane colours provided by the US Air ForceThe US presidential jet is getting a new paint design that will include one of President Donald Trump's preferred colour choices for the White House and his hotels, gold. Air Force One and other planes used by high level US officials, including First Lady Melania Trump, are being repainted gold, deep red and navy blue as they undergo scheduled repairs and maintenance, according to the US Air Force.The colours will also feature on a new luxury 747-8i Boeing plane donated to the presidential fleet by Qatar, an Air Force spokesperson told CBS.The white, blue and robin's egg blue associated with the presidential jet have been in use since the 1960s, when John F Kennedy was president.Trump has called for updates to the executive fleet since his first term. His successor, former President Joe Biden, cancelled a broad makeover Trump had initially planned.The new colours have already been spotted on model aircraft seen at the White House, where Trump is also making his aesthetic imprint, from the large-scale plans for a new ballroom to the more subtle installation of signs in a curling font in gold.The private plane Trump travelled on during his 2024 campaign, sometimes called \"Trump Force One\", used the same colour palette that will be given to the presidential fleet.While it is not clear how much the paint jobs will cost, the US Air Force, which operates the executive planes, said in a statement to the BBC that the new colour requirements were \"not expected to result in additional delays or costs to the program.\"It added that it was implementing the new colour scheme on the Boeing VC-25B (a variation of the Boeing 747) currently used to transport the president, as well as four C-32 jets often used as \"Air Force Two\" for the vice-president, and the jet donated by Qatar. Painting has been completed on of the C-32 aircraft.AFP via Getty ImagesAir Force One in its current coloursPreparations began last summer for the Pentagon to refit the Qatari jumbo jet that is expected to serve as Air Force One. The Boeing aircraft - valued at $400m (£300m) - was donated by Qatar as an \"unconditional\" gift, with any necessary retrofitting costs being borne by the US government.While any plane where the president is a passenger is called \"Air Force One\", the holder of the highest office in the country most often flies on a specialised jet that includes an office, a bedroom suite, two kitchen galleys that can prepare 100 meals, office space and a medical facility, according to Boeing.",

    "body": "21 hours agoCherylann MollanMumbaiGetty ImagesOnline users identified the machine as the Go2 model made by Chinese firm Unitree RoboticsAn Indian university has courted controversy at the AI summit in Delhi after an official claimed that a Chinese-made robotic dog was its own invention.The incident came to light after a professor from Galgotias University told state-run broadcaster DD News that the robot named \"Orion\" was \"developed\" at their Centre of Excellence. A video of her remarks went viral. Online users later identified the machine as the Go2 model made by Chinese firm Unitree Robotics, which is commercially available starting at about 200,000 rupees ($2,200; £1,600).In a statement on Wednesday, the university denied claiming it had built the robot and described the backlash as a \"propaganda campaign\".\"We would like to clearly state that the robotic programming is part of our endeavour to make students learn AI programming and develop and deploy real world skills using globally available tools and resources, given developing AI talent is need of the hour,\" the university said.Neha Singh, the professor seen in the video, later told reporters her remarks had been misunderstood. \"It might be that I could not convey well what I wanted to say, or you could not understand well what I wanted to say,\" she said.Social media users, however, accused the university of dishonesty. Reports said that following the backlash, the university was asked to vacate its stall at the summit. Faculty members said they had received no official communication to do so.But hours later, news agency Press Trust of India reported that electricity supply to the stall was cut off following the controversy.A BBC reporter at the summit said the lights were turned off at the booth and no staff from the university were around.The incident is being seen as an embarrassment for the organisers of the summit as the video had also been shared on IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw's official X account. The post has since been deleted.India's IT Secretary S Krishnan said the controversy should not \"overshadow\" the work put in by other participants at the summit.\"What happened should not affect the way people present or exhibit their work at such events. The idea is not to use an opportunity like this to become something else or create unnecessary noise.\"It is essential that a proper code of conduct is followed. There are other countries and other participants involved as well,\" he told reporters.The India AI Impact Summit, inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Bharat Mandapam on Monday, is being pitched by the government as a flagship gathering to position India as a global AI hub. Delegates from more than 100 countries, including several heads of governments, are attending, alongside industry leaders such as Sundar Pichai of Google.The five-day summit features policy discussions, startup showcases and closed-door meetings on AI governance, infrastructure and innovation. However, its opening day was overshadowed by complaints of overcrowding, long queues and confusion at the venue, prompting organisers to extend exhibition hours and tighten entry management. They say arrangements have since improved.BBC correspondent Vikas Pandey, who is at the summit, said the venue was \"absolutely buzzing\" on the third day, with thousands of people from different parts of India visiting stalls and soaking up the excitement. Officials say they hope the event and the conversations around it will help adoption of AI across the country.",

    "body": "21 minutes agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorAFPA feminist anti-immigration group said Quentin Deranque had been helping to protect its members in LyonTwo more people have been detained by French authorities investigating the killing of a far-right student activist by suspected radical left militants in Lyon, bringing the total in custody to 11.Quentin Deranque, 23, suffered a fatal brain injury when he was beaten and kicked during a protest last week on the sidelines of a conference held by Rima Hassan, a member of the European Parliament for hard-left party France Unbowed (LFI).The wave of arrests began on Wednesday and included two parliamentary aides to LFI politician Raphaël Arnault.Arnault said one, Jacques-Elie Favrot, had halted his work in parliament and his contract was being terminated. A second has had his rights suspended.Prosecutors say seven of the 11 suspects are being investigated for murder and the other four for helping others to evade police.Favrot's lawyer told reporters his client admitted being at the scene and committing violence but said \"he wasn't the one who inflicted the blows that caused Mr Deranque's death\".Although the radical left party leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon has sought to distance the party from Deranque's violent death, LFI has come under attack from rivals across the political spectrum, less than a month before France votes in key municipal elections.Government spokesperson Maud Bregeon has urged the party to suspend Raphaël Arnault from its parliamentary group because of the MP's links to Anti-Fascist Young Guard, which has been blamed for the violence a short distance from Sciences Po University in Lyon.The political climate is febrile ahead of the March votes - seen as the last test of public opinion before next year's presidential elections. Within the past month Sébastien Lecornu's minority government had to survive two no-confidence motions to push through this year's budget.LFI party co-ordinator Manuel Bompard announced on Wednesday that the party's Paris HQ was briefly evacuated because of a bomb threat, and went on to accuse a large cross-section of the political and media classes of making days of false and defamatory statements.\"I call for an end to this absolutely despicable exploitation of the tragedy that took place last Thursday evening in Lyon, for which France Unbowed bears absolutely no responsibility,\" he told reporters. \"This climate should worry everybody.\"AFPThe attack last Thursday took place a short distance from Sciences Po university in LyonVideos captured from the scene show three people lying on the ground coming under attack from a larger group, all of them wearing hoods.A feminist anti-immigration group called Némésis said Deranque had been outside the venue to protect its members. Némésis has blamed Young Guard for the attack - an allegation it denies. A minute's silence was held in the National Assembly on Tuesday for the young activist, and politicians lined up to criticise the radical-left leader and his colleagues.Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally said Mélenchon had \"moral and political responsibility\" for what had happened and even former LFI MP Alexis Corbière called on the party to take stock politically of what had happened.Sébastien Lecornu said that \"without undermining the presumption of innocence\" LFI had to \"clean up\" its statements, ideas and its ranks fast.Mélenchon hit back, saying he refused to take lessons from Lecornu.However, more moderate figures on the left such as Socialist ex-President François Hollande have accused LFI of being responsible for lowering the tone of politics in France.\"It's clear there can be no alliance in the municipal elections between the Socialists or reformist left-wing parties and LFI in the second round,\" Hollande said on Wednesday. \"The relationship is over.\"For months the party had indulged in a kind of \"brutalisation\" of debate so there was no political space between the far left and far right, said Hollande.The actions of police have also come in for criticism, as local forces were warned that Rima Hassan's event was due to take place but riot police were not on the scene at the time of the fatal attack.The death of Deranque has prompted reaction across the border in Italy, where Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has described the attack as deeply shocking and \"a wound for the whole of Europe\".",

    "body": "9 hours agoBrandon DrenonWatch: Eight of the nine missing skiers located deceased, officials sayRescue teams combing through the backcountry of California's Lake Tahoe region say they have found the bodies of eight skiers who went missing in an avalanche on Tuesday.The search for a final missing skier continues but that person is presumed dead, Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said at a news conference on Wednesday.Officials said one of the deceased was the spouse of someone on one of the search-and-rescue teams, making continued rescue efforts \"challenging emotionally\". Fifteen skiers were reported missing on Tuesday after a \"football-field\" sized avalanche came barrelling down in the Castle Peak area around 11:30 local time (19:30 GMT). Six have been rescued.Watch: California hit by heavy snow as avalanche leaves skiers missing\"I want to offer my condolences to the family in this very trying time,\" Placer County Sheriff Wayne Woo said on Wednesday.The bodies of the eight dead skiers are still trapped in the snow and can't yet be recovered due to \"pretty horrific\" conditions, officials said.Since the avalanche, another 3ft (90cm) of snow has fallen on the area, Tahoe National Forest supervisor Chris Feutrier said.\"The hazard remains high,\" he said.Once the bodies are recovered, they will be transported to the Placer County morgue.Families of the deceased have been notified. Authorities have not yet released any of their names.Officials say the victims are seven women and two men.How rescuers raced against time to reach skiersSheriff Woo said the rescue operation was a joint effort involving two teams and roughly 50 crew members who had to traverse \"extreme weather conditions\" using specialised equipment.At 17:30 local time on Tuesday, search teams arrived to an area roughly two miles (3.2km) from where survivors were sheltering in make-shift tents, and had to ski in from there.Two of the six survivors had to be carried back and \"could not walk because of the injuries they sustained during the avalanche\", Sheriff Moon said. They were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.Among the survivors, one was a guide and five were clients of the Blackbird Mountain guided tour. The entire ski group consisted of a mix of 11 recreational skiers and four ski guides.The avalanche on Tuesday occurred as they were making their way back at the end of a three-day trip. California Governor Gavin Newsom's office said in a post on X that state authorities were \"co-ordinating an all-hands search-and-rescue effort\" with local emergency teams.Conditions on Wednesday remained dangerous, multiple officials said, with Woo describing the climate as \"treacherous\".\"Avoid the backcountry,\" he said. \"Please allow us to focus all of our resources on continuing to recover these bodies for the family and bring them home.\" The avalanche that trapped the skiers was rated as a D2.5 on a destructive potential scale of D1 to D5, according to the Sierra Avalanche Center, which would mean it was over half a mile in length and would have a deposit of around 6.5ft. The Boreal Mountain Ski Resort, which is near where the accident occurred, has reported over 30in of snowfall since Tuesday.The resort decided to close on Tuesday because of high winds and low visibility.The storm has also closed several highways, including Interstate 80 and Highway 50.",

    "body": "Stephen Colbert says CBS spiked interview with Democrat over FCC fears1 day agoMax MatzaGetty ImagesUS late-night host Stephen Colbert has accused his network of refusing to broadcast an interview with a Democratic politician over fears of retaliation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).CBS, the network which hosts the programme, denies that it \"prohibited\" the interview from being aired, saying it gave only \"legal guidance\".On Monday night's show, Colbert said that CBS would not show his interview with Texas lawmaker James Talarico out of concerns about a response from the FCC, which has new guidance on equal airtime for political candidates.\"We were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,\" he said.\"Then, then I was told in some uncertain terms that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on. And because my network clearly doesn't want us to talk about this, let's talk about this.\"Colbert, host of The Late Show, went on to explain that new FCC guidance on the \"equal time\" rule - which requires certain TV and radio broadcasters to give equal time to rival political candidates - could have created legal trouble for the network, according to CBS lawyers.The FCC regulates radio, TV and satellite airwaves, giving it power over a range of matters, including mergers and decency complaints.CBS flatly denied Colbert's claims in a statement on Tuesday.\"The Late Show was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep James Talarico,\" the network said. Talarico, 36, is a Democratic candidate for a US Senate seat in Texas. CBS added in a statement: \"The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates... and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled. \"The Late Show decided to present the interview through its YouTube channel with on-air promotion on the broadcast rather than potentially providing the equal-time options.\"The full interview was later posted on YouTube, where FCC rules do not apply.News content has traditionally been exempted from the \"equal time\" rule.But the FCC has said the rule may soon apply to late-night programmes like Colbert's. It may also apply to political radio programmes, which tend to have more conservative hosts and listeners.After issuing the new guidance in January, Brendan Carr, the FCC chairman known for taking an expansive view of his power, said on X that \"for years, legacy TV networks assumed that their late-night & daytime talk shows qualify as 'bona fide news' programmes - even when motivated by purely partisan political purposes. \"Today, the FCC reminded them of their obligation to provide all candidates with equal opportunities.\" US President Donald Trump has at times said he is considering pulling the FCC licence for several US networks that he says have aired views critical of his presidency. Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, agreed in July to pay $16m (£13.5m) to settle a legal dispute with Trump regarding an interview it broadcast on CBS with former Vice-President Kamala Harris.Business commentators have questioned whether the deal was made partly so as to not affect Paramount's planned merger with Skydance Media, which Trump had the power to halt.CBS News has a partnership agreement with the BBC, meaning news content including video footage can be shared. BBC News is editorially independent of CBS.Anna Gomez, the only Democrat on the FCC board, condemned the response by CBS, saying Colbert and the network had the First Amendment constitutional right to free speech.\"This is yet another troubling example of corporate capitulation in the face of this administration's broader campaign to censor and control speech,\" she said in a statement, adding that the FCC had \"no lawful authority to pressure broadcasters for political purposes\".She continued: \"It is no secret that Paramount, CBS's parent company, has regulatory matters before the government, but corporate interests cannot justify retreating from airing newsworthy content.\"She has previously accused the FCC's Republican leaders of using the equal-time rule to unfairly penalise critics in violation of the constitutional right to free speech. The Late Show is due to end its 33-year run in May. Colbert has been the host since 2015.",

Tiago Martins, a carnival parade designer at the school, called it a deeply personal story.\"The samba says it: there are children of the poor becoming doctors, and me, a child of the poor, becoming a carnival designer,\" he told Reuters. \"We wanted to tell the story of a man who did a lot for the poor and for Brazil.\"Getty ImagesMembers of Academicos de Niteroi perform However, the opposition criticised the decision to spotlight a sitting president as a sign of early campaigning ahead of the October elections, with Lula seeking a fourth term.Several lawsuits alleging that Lula could gain a political advantage from the tribute were filed but rejected by the courts, with opposition parties even requesting the parade to be blocked.Lula himself gave his blessing to the academy and watched the performance with thousands of people from the stands in the city's giant Sambadrome arena.Getty ImagesBrazil's president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva watching the show from the standsAnother pointed political message during Academicos de Niteroi's performance was a display of former far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro as Bozo the Clown sitting behind bars.The ex-president's son Flavio Bolsonaro has vowed to appeal a decision by the electoral court after it rejected requests by two opposition parties to prevent the parade.Many on social media also took issue with a performance by dancers dressed as a traditional family preserved in a tin can titled \"preserved neoconservatives\" as mocking Christian values.Getty ImagesBolsonaro depicted as Bozo the Clown by the Academicos de NiteroiGetty ImagesRevellers of the Unidos do Viradouro samba school who took the crownDespite the controversy, the parade of giant lions, dancing books and rainbow coloured plumes still delighted the crowds.The performances are judged over 10 categories by a total of 40 judges, with the top 12 samba schools competing for the title.Getty ImagesA float of the Unidos do Viradouro samba schoolGetty ImagesDancing books, anyone?Getty ImagesA sea of green and yellow celebrates the colours of the Brazilian flagGetty ImagesColour, colour and more colour was the night's unofficial theme",

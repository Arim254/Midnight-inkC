    "body": "2 days agoChiamaka DikeBBC Africa, Makoko, LagosGift Ufuoma/BBCA mother of five, Anna Sobie's wooden home is one of many that has been demolished in a shanty town in a lagoon in Lagos, with critics describing it as a \"land-grab\" by the authorities to gentrify the prime waterfront spot in Nigeria's biggest city.Lagos State government officials deny the allegation, saying they are demolishing parts of Makoko - the country's biggest informal waterfront settlement - because it is expanding near high voltage power lines, posing a major health and safety risk.Sobie and her children now sleep on the narrow broken platform where their house stood until a few weeks ago on Lagos Lagoon. This is the biggest of 10 lagoons in a mega-city that is facing an acute housing crisis - and where life is becoming increasingly expensive, pushing more people to the margins of society. As Sobie spoke to the BBC, canoes - steered with paddles or long bamboo poles - moved through the narrow waterways, carrying mattresses and sacks of clothes belonging to the displaced people.Residents say the demolitions began two days before Christmas, when excavation teams accompanied by armed police moved into sections of the waterfront settlement facing the Atlantic Ocean.In a joint statement last month, 10 non-governmental organisations said that \"armed thugs, security personnel and demolition teams with bulldozers descended repeatedly on the community\" to tear down homes, and burn them.\"Homes were set on fire with little or no notice, in some cases while residents were still [inside],\" the NGOs added.Gift Ufuoma/BBCAnna Sobie's family are living on the the ruins of their houseWhen the BBC visited Makoko, smoke, from the rubble of torched homes or from fires that people had lit, burning damp wood to dry their clothes, was hanging in the air.Excavators were at work along the shoreline - houses built on wooden stilts over the lagoon were still being pulled down, their planks collapsing into the water below.  Corrugated metal sheets were falling from roofs and drifting between boats. Makoko was founded in the 19th Century by fishing communities who have lived in the settlement ever since, along with other low-income families and migrants who come to Lagos in search of better opportunities. Ownership of the lagoon is fiercely contested. The state government claims ownership of it under federal law, saying Makoko has been built without planning permission or occupancy rights. Older residents dispute this, saying the settlement predates modern Lagos, and they have what they call a customary right to it.Estimates of Makoko's population vary, from 80,000 to 200,000, but much of the settlement now lies in fragments.The NGOs said that more than 10,000 people have been displaced after the destruction of more than 3,000 homes, as well as schools, clinics and churches. The state government has not given any figures of the buildings demolished.Sobie's home was among those that have been destroyed. \"I was inside when it started,\" she says. \"The noise was very loud. When we came out, we saw the excavator.\"She says there was little time to move her family's belongings. Her son Solomon's school in Makoko was demolished the same day. Sobie's family moved briefly into a building nearby. That, too, was later pulled down. \"We're sleeping in an open space under the rain, and they're currently setting properties ablaze,\" Sobie says, adding:  \"We don't have another place.\" Like many other children, Solomon no longer goes to school. He now helps his mother gather firewood from collapsed houses, pulling loose planks from the debris to sell.Even as the excavators work, canoe-borne business activities continue, with traders peddling their way through the remaining homes to sell fish and goods. But many other traders can no longer do business, as they lost their goods when their homes were demolished or torched.With the lagoon central to their lives, they have protested against the move to force them out of Makoko. Gift Ufuoma/BBCThe state government says it will give financial compensation to families whose homes have been destroyedMore than 1,000 angry residents marched last week to the state legislature, the House of Assembly, demanding an audience with Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, whose offices are nearby.But police responded by firing tear gas, with protesters saying that at least one person was injured in the ensuing chaos.Community leaders and residents say that tear gas was also fired during the demolitions a few weeks ago, causing the death of five people, including children. \"Children were weeping, some died, some were unconscious, and were taken to the hospital as a result of the tear gas,\" Sobie tells the BBC.The Lagos State government says it is unaware of their personnel using tear gas or of deaths linked to the demolitions. Speaking to the BBC, the state's commissioner for information, Gbenga Omotoso, says that any such claims would be investigated.\"We would determine the actual cause of death,\" he says. \"Our personnel will not knowingly kill anybody.\"The state government has defended the demolitions, saying they are targeting homes built beneath high voltage power lines.\"No responsible government anywhere in the world can allow people to live directly under high-tension cables or obstruct vital waterways,\" the governor's special adviser on urban development, Olajide Abiodun Babatunde, said in a statement. Governor Sanwo-Olu said that affected families would be provided with financial grants and other assistance, and it was wrong to accuse him of \"destroying\" Makoko. He raised concern that shanties were \"sprawling\" at an \"incredible speed\", getting closer to the Third Mainland Bridge, the longest and busiest of three bridges connecting the mainland to the islands - the commercial heart of the city and its wealthier neighbourhoods.For the governor this spells danger.\"So, what we have done is that we just pushed them back,\" he added.Gift Ufuoma/BBCSome residents suspect their homes have been demolished to pave the way for an upmarket development Lagos-based real estate developer Peacemaker Afolabi tells the BBC that demand for land in the city is huge.\"Everywhere in Lagos is prime land,\" he says. \"And waterfront is always prime.\" Some residents suspect that the demolitions are aimed at clearing the area for private developments, including luxury homes.This has been repeatedly denied by the state government, but suspicion remains.\"This is not the slow, decades-long gentrification often seen in Western cities. It's a rapid, almost violent reshaping that is already forcing millions of residents to the margins,\" he writes. \"In the next few years, Lagos may look more polished and globally appealing. But for many of its people, it will also become profoundly unliveable.\"In their joint statement, the NGOs said that demolitions in Makoko, and other settlements last year, were part of a \"sinister agenda to grab land\". \"These actions against thousands of peaceful, hardworking residents represent a deliberate pattern of state-enabled violence against the urban poor, carried out to clear valuable land for elite interests and private mega-developments,\" the NGOs said. \"The housing deficit has thus grown from approximately 2.95 million units in 2016 to 3.4 million in 2025, a 15 per cent increase,\" Nigeria's Punch newspaper quoted the report as saying.Rapid population growth, rising rents and limited access to formal housing have pushed many low-income residents into informal settlements, particularly along waterfronts and transport corridors.The authorities have demolished homes in Makoko in the past - most recently in 2017, when residents obtained a court order to prevent forced evictions without adequate notice, compensation and resettlement.Megan Chapman, co-director of the Justice and Empowerment Initiatives campaign group, says the government has failed to provide residents affected by the latest demolitions with alternative accommodation. \"They have to identify everyone who will be affected and make arrangements before homes are lost,\" she tells the BBC\"When people are removed like this, it affects livelihoods, family structures and how communities function over time.\"When the BBC was in Makoko, boys were sitting along the lagoon, repairing their broken fishing nets. Children moved between piles of debris, collecting firewood from collapsed structures. A tractor pulled away from what was once a house. Only a small number of buildings remained standing, including the homes of traditional leaders.Elizabeth Kakisiwe says she sleeps nearby.Each evening, she lays wooden boards on damp ground for her children and packs them away again in the morning.\"We were at the market when it started,\" she says. \"When I came back, my house was gone.\"She says there was no clear warning and no time to remove belongings. Clothes, cooking utensils and mattresses were lost. When rain fell days later, they were drenched.\"At night, we sit in the cold,\" she says. \"If the children feel sick, we give them paracetamol.\"Cooking has become difficult, she says, because rain has made the ground wet and rats move through the debris. \"Yesterday, we only drank garri,\" Kakisiwe says, referring to a popular cassava-based meal that is often made as a drink. \"There is nothing to cook.\"Expressing a similar view, Sobie says: \"The suffering is much. A lot of people have been dying. We just don't know what to say. It's only God that can help us.\"Additional reporting by Gift UfuomaMore BBC stories about housing in Lagos:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "12 hours agoDoug FaulknerMiguel MEDINA / AFP via Getty ImagesA 14-year-old who stabbed his art teacher told French police he attacked her because he had \"too much hatred\", a prosecutor has said.The 60-year-old woman's condition remains a \"serious concern\" after she was stabbed three to four times in her chest in front of 22 students in south-eastern France on Tuesday, a local official said.Toulon prosecutor Raphaël Balland said in a statement that the boy had premeditated the attack, having described to police taking the knife from his kitchen at home with the \"intention of stabbing his teacher\".La Guicharde school, in Sanary-sur-Mer, was evacuated after the attack on Tuesday, and lessons the next day were cancelled.Balland said there was no known religious or political motivation for the stabbing and that the student was allegedly upset that the teacher had reported several disciplinary incidents against him, which the boy said were \"unfair\". The teenager told authorities he \"deeply regretted\" the attack, AFP news agency reported, and felt more hatred towards himself than the victim.A decision on whether to place him in pre-trial detention will be made when he appears in court.The victim, who has been at the school for 28 years, according to AFP, is in Sainte-Anne Military Hospital in Toulon. She is reported to have been stabilised after surgery but remains in a serious condition.It is the latest in a series of attacks by students in French schools in recent years.Last year, a 14-year-old was charged with the murder of a teaching assistant after allegedly stabbing her to death in June.In a separate case in April, a student killed a girl and wounded several others in a knife attack in the western city of Nantes.In 2020, teacher Samuel Paty was murdered by a Chechen refugee outside the school where he taught in a suburb of Paris, an attack which was motivated by religious extremism.Education minister Édouard Geffray, who visited the Toulon school on Tuesday, has described the attack as \"unacceptable\" and said that since March last year, 525 bladed weapons had been seized at schools \"before they could cause injury\".\"Schools reflect our society, and they cannot, on their own, stem the rise in verbal and physical violence that characterizes our times,\" he wrote on X.\"The real challenge lies here: fundamental work to de-escalate tensions. This involves families, teaching staff, elected officials, and every citizen. This is a fight we must wage together.\"",

    "body": "9 hours agoTiffany WertheimerRiccardo De Luca/Anadolu via Getty ImagesNow you see it, now you don't - one of the angels is left with no face at allThe face of an angel on a restored church fresco in Rome that sparked outrage because of its likeness to Italy's prime minister, has been crudely scrubbed out by the artist who painted it.Church and government officials launched an investigation after pictures of a cherub at the Basilica of St Lawrence in Lucina showed her newly restored face had an uncanny likeness to right-wing leader, Giorgia Meloni.The artist, Bruno Valentinetti, at first denied the claims, but on Wednesday he admitted that it was indeed the prime minister's face. He insisted that it was similar to the original, however.Valentinetti, 83, told la Repubblica that he was ordered to cover up the painting by the Vatican.The original facial features will now be restored, the office of the Diocese of Rome said on Wednesday, following a strongly worded statement from Rome's Cardinal Baldassare Reina.Expressing his \"disappointment over what happened\", Reina said \"images of sacred art and Christian tradition cannot be misused or exploited\".The Basilica of St Lawrence, which is a five minute walk from Meloni's office in the heart of Rome, has seen an influx of curious visitors hoping to catch a glimpse of the now-infamous fresco.\"There was a procession of people who came to see it and take selfies, not to pray,\" the basilica's priest, Rev. Daniele Michelett, told Ansa news agency.Michelett said he had not noticed the resemblance to the prime minister when he first saw the restoration work, but agreed that it did not \"conform to the original iconography and sacred context\" of the church.Reuters/Getty ImagesGiorgia Meloni responded in a post on Instagram saying she was \"definitely not like an angel\", accompanied by a laughing emojiThe Basilica of San Lorenzo in Lucina is one of Rome's oldest churches and features artwork by Baroque masters Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Guido Reni.However the fresco at the centre of this controversy was not old - it was painted in 2000 and was not heritage protected. The wall painting is located in a chapel dedicated to Italy's last king, Umberto II, and shows the cherub holding a map of Italy.Bruno Valentinetti was the original artist, and had been asked to restore the artwork after water damage, Micheletti said.The government agency in charge of preserving Rome's cultural sites has now informed the church that any further restoration work will require authorisation and a sketch of the proposed image.The BBC has contacted the Vatican for comment.",

    "body": "4 hours agoKelly NgReutersTrump and Xi last met in October, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in South KoreaChina's leader Xi Jinping called Taiwan \"the most important issue\" in China-US relations during a phone call with US President Donald Trump  on Wednesday. Xi had told Trump to be \"prudent\" when supplying weapons to the island, state media reported, adding that he \"attaches great importance\" to ties with Washington and hoped both sides will find ways to resolve their differences.Trump cast the call as \"excellent\" and \"long and thorough\".Wednesday's call follows a flurry of visits by Western leaders, including UK's Keir Starmer, to China in recent months, hoping to reset relations with the world's second-largest economy.Trump himself is due to visit China in April, a trip he says he \"very much looks forward to\". He added that Beijing is considering buying 20 million tonnes of US soybeans, up from the current 12 million tonnes.\"The relationship with China, and my personal relationship with President Xi, is an extremely good one, and we both realize how important it is to keep it that way,\" he wrote in a Truth Social post. The two leaders last spoke over the phone in November about a range of issues including trade, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, fentanyl and Taiwan, according to Trump and China's foreign ministry.Apart from Taiwan and soybeans, Trump and Xi also discussed Russia's war in Ukraine, the current situation in Iran, and China's purchase of oil and gas from the US in the call on Wednesday, the US president wrote.On Taiwan, Xi said the self-governed island was \"China's territory\" and that Beijing \"must safeguard [Taiwan's] sovereignty and territorial integrity\".\"The United States must handle the issue of arms sales to Taiwan with prudence,\" he warned, according to the state's Xinhua news agency.China has long vowed to \"reunify\" with Taiwan and has not ruled out the use of force to do so.The US has formal ties with Beijing rather than Taiwan, and has walked a tight diplomatic rope for decades. But it remains a powerful ally of Taiwan's and is the island's biggest arms supplier.In December, the Trump administration announced a huge arms sale worth around $11bn (£8.2bn) to Taiwan, which included advanced rocket launchers, self-propelled howitzers and a variety of missiles.Beijing said at the time that this \"attempt to support [Taiwan's] independence\" would only \"accelerate the push towards a dangerous and violent situation across the Taiwan Strait\".\"Just as the United States has its concerns, China for its part also has concerns,\" Xi told Trump on Wednesday.\"If the two sides work in the same direction in the spirit of equality, respect and mutual benefit, we can surely find ways to address each other's concerns,\" he said.Hours before his call with Trump, Xi held a virtual meeting with Russia's leader Vladimir Putin, in which both hailed the strengthening of ties between Beijing and Moscow.",

    "body": "11 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseGetty ImagesRyan Routh was taken into custody shortly after being fired upon by a Secret Service agent during the incident in West Palm Beach, Florida. Ryan Routh has been sentenced to life in prison for attempting to assassinate President Donald Trump on a Florida golf course in September of 2024. Routh, 59, was found guilty last year of trying to kill Trump, then still a presidential candidate, at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. A US Secret Service agent in the area spotted a rifle barrel poking out of the bushes and fired at Routh, who then fled the scene. He was arrested nearby. In a sentencing memorandum, Judge Aileen Cannon said Routh's crimes \"undeniably warrant a life sentence\".\"[H]e took steps over the course of months to assassinate a major Presidential candidate, demonstrated the will to kill anybody in the way, and has since expressed neither regret nor remorse to his victims,\" she wrote. Routh's lawyer, Martin Ross, said they would be appealing the case. Routh pleaded not guilty and elected to represent himself during the trial, which began on 8 September. A native of North Carolina who lived in Hawaii prior to his arrest, Routh repeatedly acted erratically during the court proceedings, including challenging Trump to a game of golf and making references to Adolf Hitler and Russian President Vladimir Putin. After a jury found him guilty, Routh attempted to stab himself in the neck with a pen before US marshals quickly escorted him out of the courtroom. While Routh is not believed to have had a clear line of sight to Trump at any point during the incident, federal agents told jurors they later recovered a semiautomatic rifle with a scope and an extended magazine in the spot where he had been hiding. Additionally, jurors were told that Routh left behind a list of places where Trump was likely to appear, as well as a note for a friend which described the incident as \"an assassination attempt\". In his closing statement during the trial, Routh spoke in the third person and touched on a wide variety of unrelated topics, including US history, the Russia-Ukraine war and his intention to buy a boat - prompting the judge to repeatedly interrupt him and send the jury away. The lead prosecutor in the case, John Shipley, said that a \"mountain of evidence\" was presented which points to \"how close he got to actually pulling this off\". The incident in Florida was the second attempt on Trump's life in 2024, after a gunman opened fire at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. That shooting left one person dead and several wounded, including Trump. The shooter, later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Crooks, was killed by officers at the scene. ",

    "body": "12 hours agoBethany BellReutersGerman left-wing activist Maja T. has been sentenced to eight years in prisonA German activist has been sentenced to eight years in a Hungarian prison for assaulting right-wing extremists and for being a member of an extreme left-wing group.The 25-year-old, identified only as Maja T., was found guilty of involvement in violent assaults by the group Antifa Ost in the lead-up to an annual commemoration of Nazi soldiers in Budapest.But supporters have raised concerns over whether Maja T., who identifies as non-binary, could receive a fair trial in the Hungarian court, because the country legally recognises only two genders and Pride marches are banned. Last year, Germany's Constitutional Court found Maja T. could face discriminatory treatment and said an extradition should not proceed. But the ruling came too late to stop the handover, as police in Germany had already delivered Maja T. to Hungarian authorities by helicopter in an overnight operation in 2024.The 25-year-old did not comment on the allegations during the trial and the verdict is subject to appeal.Antifa OstIn February 2023, far-right groups from across Europe gathered in Budapest to commemorate the anniversary of the end of the Second World War.The so-called Day of Honour marked an attempt in 1945 by the German Wehrmacht, the Waffen-SS, and their Hungarian collaborators to break through a Soviet siege of the city.The commemoration is tolerated by the Hungarian authorities.Between 9 and 11 February 2023, about 20 alleged left-wing extremists from Antifa Ost, a militant far-left multinational group also known as the \"hammer gang\", attacked people with batons, rubber hammers and pepper spray at several places in Budapest. Officials said the attackers believed their victims had participated in the commemoration.Nine people were injured in a number of incidents, four of them seriously. Prosecutors said Maja T. was involved in two attacks and part of a criminal organisation.German MEP Martin Schirdewan from the socialist Die Linke party described the proceedings as a \"political show trial\", and said Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán had \"deliberately exploited this trial for his election campaign\".\"Eight years in prison for Maja T. is disproportionate,\" he wrote. \"This is not about justice, but about setting a political example.\"Those trials are focused on the violence in Budapest and other incidents in Germany.The designation makes group members ineligible to enter the US, freezes any assets they may have there and makes it a crime to provide material support to the group.Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has called for Antifa Ost to be banned domestically.

    "body": "Israeli strikes kill 20 in Gaza, hospitals say, after soldier wounded by gunfire16 hours agoYolande Knell,Middle East correspondent, JerusalemandDavid GrittenTariq Mohammad/ShutterstockSeveral of those killed were brought to Nasser hospital in the southern city of Khan YounisAt least 20 Palestinians, including several children and a paramedic, have been killed and almost 40 others wounded in Israeli strikes in Gaza, hospitals say.The Israeli military said tanks and aircraft carried out \"precise strikes\" against what it called \"terrorists\" who opened fire on troops in the north of the strip, seriously wounding an officer.It added that the attack happened close to the Yellow Line, beyond which Israeli forces are stationed in Gaza, and that it constituted a \"blatant violation\" of the three-month-old ceasefire deal with Hamas.Hamas accused Israel of using the shooting as \"a flimsy pretext to justify the continuation of killing and aggression against our people\".Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City said it had received the bodies of 13 people, including five children, who were killed when tents for displaced families and homes in the eastern Zeitoun and Tuffah neighbourhoods were hit.Among the mourners gathered in the hospital's courtyard for funeral prayers was Abu Mohammed Haboush, who said his family was asleep in their home when it was shelled.\"Our children were martyred - my son was martyred, my brother's son and daughter were martyred,\" he told Reuters news agency.\"We have nothing to do with anything, we are peaceful people.\"Nasser hospital in the city of Khan Younis said four dead, including one child, were brought there following strikes on tents in the southern Qizan Rashwan area.Another two children, sisters Rahaf and Remas Abu Jamea, and paramedic Hussein al-Samiri were later killed in the coastal al-Mawasi area west of Khan Younis, hospital officials said.A first responder from the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency, Jihad al-Hinnawi, told Reuters that the paramedic had rushed to help victims of a strike on a tent in the coastal al-Mawasi area and was then killed by a second strike on the same location.ReutersTwo children and a paramedic were reportedly killed in two strikes on a tent camp in al-MawasiThe Palestinian Red Crescent said separately that Samiri was killed \"while carrying out his humanitarian duty in Khan Younis\". It also accused the Israeli military of a \"grave violation\" of international humanitarian law, which protects medical personnel.The International Committee of the Red Cross said it was \"appalled\" to learn of Samiri's killing and stressed that it was \"unacceptable that first responders in Gaza continue to face risk to their lives while carrying out humanitarian mission\".The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the strike in al-Mawasi targeted a platoon commander of the elite Nukhba forces of Hamas's military wing, whom it named as Bilal Abu Assi. It alleged that he had led the attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October 2023 and \"likely took part in holding deceased hostages captive throughout the war\".\"The IDF is aware of the claim that several uninvolved civilians, including a medical staff member, were hit in the strike. Prior to and during the strike, steps were taken in order to mitigate harm to civilians,\" it added.Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of near-daily violations since the ceasefire took effect on 10 October.On Sunday, more than 30 people were killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza. The IDF said its forces launched those strikes after gunmen emerged from a tunnel in the southern Rafah area, beyond the Yellow Line.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said at least 556 people have been killed by Israeli fire, while the Israeli military has said four of its soldiers have been killed in Palestinian attacks.The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,820 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.",

    "body": "Doctor who treated Bondi Junction mass killer referred to health regulator2 hours agoLana LamSydneyRohan AndersonJoel Cauchi, 40, was first diagnosed with schizophrenia as a teenagerA psychiatrist who treated the man behind a fatal stabbing rampage at a crowded Sydney shopping centre will be referred to health investigators after a coroner's inquiry.Joel Cauchi, first diagnosed with schizophrenia in his teens, was unmedicated and homeless when he stabbed 16 people inside Westfield Bondi Junction in 2024, killing six.The New South Wales coroner said Dr Andrea Boros-Lavack had provided 40-year-old Cauchi \"exemplary\" care over a long period, but failed to heed warnings from family that he may be relapsing, years before the attack.This mistake was one of many that led to the tragedy, the coroner said, also pointing to a series of actions by police and shopping centre security.Six people - Dawn Singleton, 25; Yixuan Cheng, 27; Jade Young, 47; Ashlee Good, 38; Faraz Tahir, 30; and Pikria Darchia, 55 - died during the attack in April 2024.Ten others, including Good's baby, were injured in the three minutes before Cauchi - who was suffering a psychotic episode - was shot dead by New South Wales (NSW) police inspector Amy Scott.During a five-week coroner's inquest that finished last May, the coroner heard from dozens of witnesses including doctors, police, survivors and the families of victims  in a bid to unearth the events leading up to the attack and prevent such a tragedy occurring again. The coroner's 800-page plus findings were due to be released at the end of 2025 but they were delayed as a mark of respect for the victims of the Bondi Beach attack, in which 15 people were killed by two gunmen on 14 December. On Thursday, Teresa O'Sullivan told the coroner's court that Boros-Lavack had provided \"personalised, consistent and compassionate treatment\" for Cauchi for many years after she first took him on as a private patient in 2012.Between 2018 and mid-2019, the Queensland psychiatrist had worked closely with Cauchi to wean him off the medications he had been taking to treat his condition, a move that was not criticised by the coroner.However, in late-2019 when Cauchi's mother raised concerns that her son was possibly relapsing, Boros-Lavack \"failed to take more active steps or to recognise the seriousness of the situation that was unfolding before her\".She said it was a \"major failing\" for the doctor to \"not do more to proactively urge Cauchi to resume his medication\".When Cauchi moved to another city and and came under the care of a different doctor, a discharge letter from Boros-Lavack also failed to provide enough information to prompt intervention, the coroner said. It didn't emphasise the need for Cauchi to see a psychiatrist or that an urgent review of his case should be a priority.O'Sullivan's recommendation that Boros-Lavack be investigated by Queensland health authorities followed calls by some of the victim's families for such action.She also found there was a missed opportunity for police intervention after an email raising concerns about Cauchi's mental health was not acted upon due to staff shortages .The officer \"overlooked a single email amidst a significant workload\", O'Sullivan said.The inquest heard a security guard who was the sole person in the CCTV control room at the Westfield when Cauchi attacked his first victim was \"not competent\" for that role. However, O'Sullivan said this was the fault of the shopping centre, which has since improved its processes. Among her 23 recommendations, O'Sullivan also called on the NSW government to improve its mental health outreach services and provide short-term housing for people with mental health issues.The coroner praised the police and emergency services response to the stabbings, describing them as \"commendably rapid and extensive\" but said there were issues with the \"inter-operability\" between various agencies that could be improved. She also recommended a public awareness campaign with the message of \"escape, hide, tell\" when there is a situation with an armed offender.O'Sullivan, though, did criticise some media coverage, which she said \"exacerbated the trauma already being suffered\" by victims and families affected, and said she would be making recommendations to the Australian Press Council on how reporters should cover incidents that involve mass casualties.The coroner also recommended bravery awards for the police officer who shot Cauchi, two Frenchmen who tried to stop Cauchi during the attack, the husband of victim Jade Young, and Ashlee Good, who died while trying to shield her baby.Outside the court, Noel McLaughlin - Young's husband - said the inquest mattered greatly.\"The evidence has shown that what first appeared to be a sudden and random act of violence was, in fact, the end point of a long story,\" he said.Earlier, Cauchi's parents released a statement, saying they hoped the coroner's findings would prevent such a tragedy happening again.",

    "body": "13 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editor in OsloNTB/Ane Hem via REUTERSA court sketch shows Marius Borg Høiby giving evidence The son of Norway's crown princess has told a court in Oslo he has lived a life of partying out of an extreme need of validation, on the second day of his trial for rape and more than 30 other alleged offences.Marius Borg Høiby, 29, looked overwhelmed by the occasion, his voice quivering as he paused several times to take off his glasses and wipe his eyes. Holding back tears, he said it was very difficult to talk, and complained of being followed by the press since he was three years old.He denies four allegations of rape as well as other serious charges against him. He was giving evidence after the first woman he is alleged to have raped told the court she believed \"100 percent\" that she had been drugged during an \"after-party\" in the basement of Høiby's parents' house in December 2018.The woman spoke of her sense of \"betrayal and shock\" after police showed her videos several years later, allegedly depicting him sexually assaulting her shortly after they had had brief, consensual sex.She had already spoken of a \"black hole\" in her memory and told the court behind closed doors that she had no recollection of what happened.The court has ordered the media not to give any information that might identify any of the four women. There is also a ban on any photos of Marius Borg Høiby, either inside the court building or on his way to and from the trial. The 29-year-old defendant, who was born four years before his mother, Mette-Marit, married Norway's Crown Prince Haakon, is not a member of the royal family or a public figure, but grew up as part of the wider family.During his first appearance in court on Tuesday, he was seen shaking. He is understood have had hospital treatment overnight. Høiby was arrested on Sunday on suspicion of assault and wielding a knife and remanded in custody for four weeks. However, he did not return to custody before his statement on Wednesday.He took a seat in court and after several minutes appearing to be overcome by the occasion, he regained his composure and told the court he had had a lot of sex, drugs and alcohol because he had an extreme need of validation.\"I am known for being Mamma's son. Nothing else,\" he told the three judges.\"Few can relate to the life I have led. A lot of parties, alcohol, some drugs.\"His trial comes at a tense moment for his mother, who was found to have exchanged hundreds of messages with the late US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein over a three-year period.The royal palace said on Wednesday that Crown Princess Mette-Marit had postponed a private trip \"until further notice\", without giving further details.She has expressed regret and poor judgement over the correspondence.However, the storm of criticism over the unguarded, warm tone of the exchanges has heaped pressure on the royal house, when Mette-Marit is also seeing her son on trial for rape. Marius Borg Høiby was arrested in August 2024 after a violent incident at his girlfriend's flat in the Frogner area of western Oslo, when he is alleged to have torn down a chandelier, thrown a knife at the wall and shattered a mirror, while hurling abuse at her.At the time he spoke of having suffered for years with mental issues and admitted to substance abuse. After a lengthy police investigation, he was charged a large number of offences, ranging from rape, assault, threatening a girlfriend and damaging her flat, as well as drugs charges and driving offences. If found guilty he could face at least 10 years in jail.He is accused of raping four women between December 2018 and November 2024, all of them after consensual sex, and while they were either asleep or incapacitated. One of the charges involves full intercourse, and the other three sexual assault, which is also seen as rape in Norway.Wearing a dark blue woollen sweater over of a smart beige shirt, he looked straight at the three judges who were sitting about 10m (30ft) away from him. Later in the afternoon he removed the sweater.Although he had notes, he rarely looked down at them. He spoke for about half an hour without interruption.Høiby did not look to his left where two of the women he is alleged to have raped listened to his evidence a short distance away. The woman who gave evidence earlier did not stay in court.He spoke of how he met her at a party in 2018 and had taken cocaine for the first time.When he finished giving his statement, prosecutor Sturla Henriksbø asked him about the first alleged rape in 2018.The defendant disputed the account given earlier, and said he did not remember taking videos, denying they had had brief consensual sex for a few seconds in a toilet in his parents' basement. Instead he said they had had consensual sex after others at the after-party had gone to bed.Asked by the prosecutor if she had been awake when they had sex, he was adamant: \"I don't sleep with women who aren't awake.\"The 29-year-old has denied all but one of six counts of sexually offensive conduct without consent which includes filming graphic videos. In his testimony, he admitted filming a five-minute video of the woman in his family's basement, although he did not remember doing so.When pressed by the prosecutor how he could be sure she was awake in the video, he appeared to become frustrated, saying he had said \"a million times\" he did not remember the sequence of events.The woman's attorney, Heidi Reisvang, told the BBC that it had been extremely hard for her client to give evidence over two days and she was relieved it was over: \"The most important thing for her was to say she was not able to resist or give consent.\"Marius Borg Høiby also took aim at the Norwegian press, accusing them of twisting the facts, disputing a story that his mother had taken a sim-card out of his phone before it was handed to police at the time of his arrest in August 2024.He is due to continue giving evidence on Thursday.",

It is unclear if Nancy Guthrie's children were directed to do so by authorities. Pima County Sheriff's Office said on Wednesday they were still speaking with anyone who had contact with Nancy Guthrie last weekend, and that no suspect or person of interest had so far been identified.Savannah Guthrie, joined by her sister Annie and brother Cameron, said in the clip they were aware of an alleged ransom note, which was sent to at least one media outlet.  \"Mommy, if you are hearing this, you are a strong woman,\" the Today show presenter said, her voice breaking. \"Everyone is looking for you, mommy. Everywhere. We will not rest. Your children will not rest until we are together again.\"Officials have warned Nancy Guthrie could be in dire health without her medication, which Savannah Guthrie mentioned in the clip. \"Our mom is our heart and our home,\" she said. \"Her health, her heart is fragile. She lives in constant pain. \"She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive. She needs it not to suffer.\"Her sister, Annie, said the \"light is missing from our lives\". \"Momma,\" she said, \"if you are listening we need you to come home. We miss you.\"NBC via Getty ImagesSavannah Guthrie with her mother, Nancy, on the set of Today Shortly after the video was posted, US President Donald Trump commented on Truth Social about the case. He said he was directing all federal law enforcement to help bring the investigation to a close and \"get her mother home safely\".\"I spoke with Savannah Guthrie, and let her know that I am directing ALL Federal Law Enforcement to be at the family's, and Local Law Enforcement's, complete disposal, IMMEDIATELY,\" he said, adding that the nation was praying for her family.The BBC has contacted the FBI and local officials for comment.What we know about the possible abduction of Savannah Guthrie's motherAlleged ransom notes investigated in disappearance of Savannah Guthrie's motherPima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has described an all-hands-on-deck search with dogs, drones, helicopters and federal agents to find the missing woman.Nancy Guthrie was last seen at her home in Catalina Foothills, an affluent neighbourhood roughly six miles (10km) north-east of Tucson, on Saturday evening, when family members dropped her off around 21:30 local time.She did not attend church on Sunday morning, which prompted members of her congregation to notify family members. When detectives searched her home, they found a scene that caused \"grave concern\", Sheriff Nanos said. He refused to elaborate on what was found. \"We do believe that Nancy was taken from her home against her will. And that's where we're at,\" he said. He would not comment on reports about blood found at the property.Sheriff's officials have asked people to stop sharing misinformation about the case. Savannah Guthrie is one of the most famous faces in US media and her video garnered support from across the media landscape and Hollywood. The broadcast journalist, who joined NBC in 2007, was named co-anchor of NBC's Today show in 2012. She also serves as NBC News' chief legal correspondent, and presents during the network's Thanksgiving Day programming and from the Olympics. Savannah Guthrie had been due to co-host NBC's coverage of the Opening Ceremony for the Winter Olympics in Milan on Friday.But she withdrew because of her mother's disappearance. Presenter Mary Carillo will take her place, NBC said.\"Our hearts go out to Savannah and the entire Guthrie family,\" Molly Solomon, the executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production, said in a statement. \"They continue to have our full support.\"According to the Arizona Republic newspaper, a historic church in Tucson invited the community to gather on Wednesday to pray for Nancy Guthrie's safe return.",

    "body": "A global craze for Korean culture is making its humblest snacks unaffordable6 hours agoYuna Ku,SeoulandSuhnwook Lee,SeoulGetty ImagesSouth Korea is known to be the world's largest producer and exporter of dried gimBlack, crispy, often flat and square - dried seaweed, known locally as gim - is a humble staple on everyday dining tables across South Korea. But as its global popularity grows, its rising prices are worrying gim-lovers nationwide.Lee Hyang-ran has been selling gim for the past 47 years. \"In the past, people from Western countries thought Koreans were eating something weird that looks like a piece of black paper,\" the vendor, who is in her 60s, says from a small market stall in central Seoul.\"I never thought I'd be selling gim to them. But now, they all come here and buy it.\"South Korea is known to be the world's largest producer and exporter of gim, supplying markets across Asia, North America and Europe. Some even refer to the product as Korea's \"black semiconductor\", a reference to South Korea's large share of the global semiconductor industry. Exports have risen steadily in recent years - and in 2025, South Korea's dried seaweed exports hit a record $1.13bn, according to the Korea Maritime Institute (KMI).And as demand rises, so do prices.Known locally as an affordable snack or ingredient, gim typically cost around 100 won ($0.06; £0.05) per sheet in 2024 - with the snack usually sold in bundles of 10 sheets or more, or around $0.60 per pack.  But last month, the price of one sheet of gim rose to above 150 won - a record high in the country. \"Premium products now cost as much as 350 won per sheet,\" said Lee. BBC/Suhnwook LeeLee Hyang-ran has been selling gim for 47 years Kim Jaela, who's in her 30s, typically buys gim in bulk - about 500 small sheets at a time, enough to last her several months. But she says this may need to change, considering how expensive gim has become. She does most of her grocery shopping online, and was checking prices on her phone during the interview.\"Oh my, it really did get more expensive by a few dollars! Luckily, I can survive a few more weeks with two packs of gim, but if I see the same or higher price later, I probably won't restock,\" she said.A humble Korean staple The worldwide appetite for gim reflects a growing global demand in Korean goods, driven by cultural influences like K-pop and K-dramas. As global audiences engage more deeply with such entertainment, they're also increasing looking to Korean cuisine, something businesses worldwide have picked up on. In 2023, US supermarket chain Trader Joe's Gimbap - a Korean rice roll wrapped in seaweed - went viral and was cleared off the shelves nationwide shortly after its launch.\"I first learned about gim because it's a typical Korean food often seen in K-dramas,\" Miki, a 22-year-old visitor from Japan told the BBC. \"We do have similar thing called nori in Japan, but the taste is totally different. Gim is lighter and crispier, and is mostly grilled with sesame oil and salt, whereas nori is typically seasoned with soy sauce.\"Viola, a 60-year-old visitor from Brooklyn, New York, says she enjoys gim as a snack. \"I just pop it in my mouth like a potato chip,\" she said, adding that it feels like a \"healthier alternative\". \"From Asian to Western countries, more people are becoming familiar with gim, increasing global demand,\" said Lee Eunhee, a professor of consumer studies at Inha University. \"To meet overseas demand, domestic prices are being pushed up.\"Kim Namin, 29, runs a seasoned gim processing factory with a 30-year family history in Wando, an island in South Korea's southern waters known for abalone and seaweed production. His factory purchases raw seaweed, grills it with oil and salt, and cuts it into the familiar rectangular sheets sold in stores.Over the past five years, most of their products have been exported globally. \"There aren't enough gim factories compared to the rising demand,\" he said, saying that his family is now considering expanding operations.He adds that gim is a highly price-sensitive staple in South Korea, long associated with affordability. Even marginal increases in its cost are keenly felt by consumers and tend to provoke strong public resistance - another reason why he's  focusing more on overseas markets.Government officials and experts say the price increase is being driven by multiple factors, including overall inflation, rising labour costs, and a decline in overseas production. However, many agree that increased growing global demand remains a major driver.In an effort to appease domestic consumers, companies - alongside the government - are taking steps to curb rising costs.South Korea's Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries has pledged to closely monitor the situation to stabilise its price. and Korean food companies like Pulmone have plans to establish a land-based seaweed R&D centre, so they can be harvested throughout the year. Back in Seoul, the market buzzes with tourists, and business is booming for Lee. \"Gim has been selling like hot cakes... the ones for making gimbap are especially popular,\" she says. \"I'm glad Korean gim is getting popular.\"",

    "body": "15 hours agoKhanyisile NgcoboJohannesburgGallo via Getty ImagesJohn Steenhuisen has served as the Democratic Alliance leader since 2019South Africa's Democratic Alliance (DA) leader John Steenhuisen has said he will not seek re-election as the party's leader in April - a move that may threaten the stability of the coalition government.The DA, South Africa's second largest party, entered into a coalition with its arch rival the African National Congress in 2024 after the ANC lost its parliamentary majority.Steenhuisen took over leadership of the pro-business DA in 2019 and currently serves as agriculture minister in President Cyril Ramaphosa's government.The 49-year-old was widely expected to run again but was reportedly forced to abandon his bid because of several controversies.\"For the rest of this term of office, I will focus all of my time and energy as minister of agriculture on defeating the most devastating foot-and-mouth disease outbreak our country has ever seen,\" he told a press conference.Steenhuisen began his political career aged 22 when he was elected to the council of the the port city of Durban for the Democratic Party, the DA's predecessor.He rose up through the party's local and then regional leadership before becoming leader of the party, which traditionally has a white support base, two decades later.It was widely reported that Steenhuisen would run unopposed for the leadership at the DA's upcoming conference.But it seems a variety of issues led to his decision not to do so, including his fallout with another senior DA member, ex-Environment Affairs Minister Dion George, and allegations, of which he was cleared in January, that he had abused his party credit card.He has also been criticised for his handling of the foot-and-mouth outbreak, with farmers accusing his department of being an \"obstacle in a crisis\", according to South Africa's News24 website.The country has struggled over the past four years to contain the highly infectious virus that has now spread to most the country's provinces - badly affecting the livestock industry.It causes blisters inside an animal's mouth and under their hooves, which can cause lameness and problems feeding. In dairy cattle, milk yields will be lost and the cattle's value will be permanently reduced.Under Steenhuisen, the DA party agreed to join the ANC as its biggest partner in the government of national unity nearly two years ago.It was an historic moment for the country as the ANC, the party that  brought in democratic rule in 1994 with Nelson Mandela and ended white-minority rule, had lost its parliamentary majority.As expected it has been a fractious political marriage, but despite some differences they have stayed together - and Steenhuisen and Ramaphosa have shown how the partnership can work.This was best exemplified when they supported each other in the Oval Office showdown with US President Donald Trump in May last year.After Trump confronted the delegation with a video in support of discredited claims of a white genocide in South Africa, it was Steenhuisen who assured the US president that the majority of white farmers wanted to stay in the country.Their performance proved to South Africans that the government of national unity was worth the bickering at home.No DA leaders have announced their candidacies for the top post yet, but Cape Town mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis has been touted as a possible successor. Steenhuisen and Hill-Lewis are close and the latter has repeatedly said he would not run against his friend, according to the TimesLive news site.More BBC stories on South Africa:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Libyan prosecutors launch probe into killing of Gaddafi's son17 hours agoNick Springate,Maia DaviesandWycliffe MuiaReutersIt is not clear who killed Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who still had political ambitionsLibyan prosecutors say they are investigating the killing of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of the country's long-time leader Col Muammar Gaddafi. The 53-year-old, who was once widely seen as his father's heir apparent, was killed during a \"direct confrontation\" with four unknown gunmen who broke into his home in the city of Zintan, his office said in a statement. \"The victim died from wounds by gunfire,\" Libyan prosecutors said on Wednesday, adding that efforts were under way to identify the gunmen. In a different version of events, his sister told Libyan TV that he had died near the country's border with Algeria.Saif al-Islam's lawyer told the AFP news agency a \"four-man commando\" unit carried out an assassination at his home in the city of Zintan, though it was not clear who may have been behind the attack.The public prosecutor's office said forensic experts had been dispatched to Zintan in north-west Libya to conduct investigations. Saif al-Islam was long seen as the most influential and feared figure in the country after his father, who ruled Libya from 1969 until being ousted and killed during an uprising in 2011.BBC World Affairs editor John Simpson, who had met Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, said that he was \"a strange, mercurial figure, but he was much less eccentric than his father\".\"During the 2011 revolution, he agreed to be interviewed for the BBC, only to scream insults at me in front of his officials,\" Simpson said.\"Then he sent them away, and apologised profusely. 'They expect it of me,' he said.\"According to Libyan journalist and writer Abdulkader Assad, Saif al-Islam might have been targeted by locals who felt their political influence was being threatened by his popularity.\"It could also be foreign actors took him out because of his controversial past,\" Abdulkader told the BBC's Newsday programme.Born in 1972, he played a key role in Libya's rapprochement with the West from 2000 until the collapse of the Gaddafi regime.After his father's removal, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi - who was accused of playing a key role in the brutal repression of anti-government protests - was jailed by a rival militia in the city of Zintan for almost six years.The International Criminal Court (ICC) wanted to put him on trial for crimes against humanity for his alleged role in the suppression of opposition protests in 2011. In 2015, he was given a death sentence in absentia for his role in the crackdown by a court in Tripoli, in the west of the country, where control is in the hands of the UN-backed government.But he was released by militia in Tobruk, in the east, under an amnesty law two years later.Simpson attended his trial in Zintan.\"In the courtroom he greeted me and my television crew with relief, maybe thinking that our presence would save him from execution,\" he said.\"But he had great faith in his negotiating skills and his personal charm, and he managed to win over his captors, who eventually freed him. \"But the loathing many Libyans felt for his father extended to him, and may have brought about his death.\"Since the overthrow of Gaddafi, Libya has been split into areas controlled by various militias and is currently divided between two rival governments.During his father's time as leader, he shaped policy and led high-profile negotiations despite having no official role in government, including those which led his father to abandon his nuclear weapons programme.Such agreements saw international sanctions on the north African country lifted, and some considered Gaddafi a reformist and acceptable face of a changing Libya.Gaddafi had always denied that he wanted to inherit power from his father, saying the reins of power were \"not a farm to inherit\".However, in 2021 he announced he would run for the presidency in elections which were then postponed indefinitely.More BBC stories on Libya:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "11 hours agoGuy De LauneyBalkans correspondentGetty ImagesA banner saying \"we won't surrender the Generalstab\" is held outside the ruins in BelgradeThe Trump International Hotel proposed for the Serbian capital Belgrade was supposed to mark a new chapter in the country's modern history. It would take the place of one of the city's most arresting sights: the bomb-damaged, but still semi-functional, remains of the defence ministry complex, or Generalstab (General Staff) as it is otherwise known.One major obstacle stood in the way: Generalstab was listed as cultural heritage.The government tried to get around this by removing the complex from the register of protected buildings but now Culture Minister Nikola Selakovic is on trial for abuse of office, accused of using his position to influence or falsify documents to revoke Generalstab's cultural heritage status.Prosecutors are calling for a three-year prison sentence, while President Aleksandar Vucic has promised to pardon the minister if judges convict him. Whatever the verdict, it now seems highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to check into a Trump International in Belgrade.ReutersThe project always had been a hard sell, given the recent history between the US and Serbia. US warplanes carried out the Nato air strikes in 1999 which reduced Generalstab to the shattered state in which it has remained.Bearing in mind that Washington was also the main sponsor of Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia in 2008, there is not an abundance of goodwill towards the US among Serbians.So there was a collective raising of eyebrows in 2024 when Serbia's government struck a deal with the US president's son-in-law Jared Kushner to redevelop Generalstab through his Affinity Global company. Surprise turned to outrage with his announcement last year that a Trump International Hotel would form the centrepiece of the project.Vucic insisted the time was right for Serbia to \"overcome the burden from 1999\". He told the BBC last year that his governing Progressive Party was \"ready to build better relations with the US\", saying: \"I think that is terribly important for this country.\"It soon became clear that many Serbs did not share that perspective – at least when it came to Generalstab. Opposition to Kushner's project brought together an unlikely coalition of architects, military veterans and student-led anti-corruption protesters.The architects pointed out that the bombed buildings had been the only project completed in Serbia by the renowned Yugoslav architect Nikola Dorbrovic, while the veterans saw them as a de facto memorial for the people who died in the 1999 air strikes. The students noted that the deal with Affinity Global had gone through without any tender process.EPA/ShutterstockAs well as maintaining business interests, Jared Kusher serves as an unofficial overseas envoy for his father-in-law's administration, including on Gaza and Ukraine talksNone of this stopped the government from trying to push through the project. In November, MPs passed special legislation to allow the Trump Hotel to be built.But prosecutors had also been keeping an eye on the affair, particularly efforts to remove Generalstab from the protected heritage register. That led to them bringing charges against the culture minister and three other officials in December.Selakovic responded by calling prosecutors an \"organised criminal group\" and an \"autoimmune disease\", accusing them of \"targeting the president\".But the charges proved one controversy too many for Kushner. His company stated they wanted to \"unite rather than divide\" and their withdrawal was \"out of respect for the citizens of Serbia and the City of Belgrade\".Vucic has made no secret of his fury. He has called the prosecution \"shameful and pathetic\" and \"disgusting political manipulation\".Last month, his governing party pushed through amendments to judicial legislation, despite critics' warnings that this would reduce the independence of prosecutors and judges.The EU's enlargement commissioner, Marta Kos, described the laws as a \"serious step backwards\", saying they had been \"adopted in a very fast and non-transparent procedure, without any consultations\".Protesters have been back on the streets of Belgrade, this time outside the court where the minister is on trial. They held a banner reading \"we are all witnesses\".As for Kushner, his focus has switched to Albania, where he plans to build a luxury resort on Sazan Island. The country's Prime Minister Edi Rama says he is \"proud and happy\".It is not yet clear whether a Trump International Hotel is in the offing.",

The arrest of Muharram, who has not yet commented, was made possible thanks to a series of intelligence-led operations, the agency said.Under Zambian law, marijuana is classed as a dangerous drug and is illegal to possess.The trafficking, possession and use of illegal drugs such as cannabis is punishable by a fine or a prison sentence.The southern Africa country struggles with drug abuse and trafficking, especially cannabis and heroin.During Tuesday's operations, the DEC said it had seized 221.2kg of cannabis hidden in a lorry in Lusaka's Lilayi area.The search was extended to Muharram's residence in Lilayi, where officers discovered an additional 1,159.6kg of \"high-grade\" cannabis, bringing the total seizure to 1,380.8kg, the agency added. A Zambian national who was also arrested is believed to be an accomplice in the organised drug-trafficking scheme.The DEC said their operations also saw the arrests of:A Zambian national for trafficking 55 boxes of Benylin containing codeine in LusakaTwo other Zambians for trafficking cannabis concealed in their vehicleTwo Burundian nationals in the southern district of Chirundu for trafficking cannabis in separate vehicles: some was hidden inside a spare lorry tyre, some in gas compressors and additional cannabis was mixed with sugar, salt and paint and concealed in tins and buckets of paint.\"All suspects have since been detained in lawful custody and will appear in court soon,\" DEC said in a statement. The agency said it was committed to ensuring that Zambia was neither used as a corridor nor a destination for drug trafficking.More BBC stories about Zambia:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

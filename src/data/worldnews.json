    "body": "Dutch volleyball player and convicted child rapist denied visa to compete in Australia18 hours agoLana LamSydneyReutersSteven van de Velde was due to compete in Adelaide next monthA Dutch Olympic volleyball player convicted of raping a British girl a decade ago has been denied a visa to compete in Australia.Steven van de Velde, 31, was due to play at the Beach Volleyball World Championships in Adelaide, South Australia, next month.In 2016, the then 21-year-old pleaded guilty to three counts of raping a 12-year-old girl in Milton Keynes and was sentenced to four years in jail. He had met the girl on Facebook and travelled to England from Amsterdam before raping her in her home in 2014.Two weeks ago, South Australia's Attorney-General Kyam Maher wrote to the federal government, calling on authorities to reject his visa as his crimes were \"utterly abhorrent\".The letter also said \"we do not believe that foreign child sex offenders should be granted entry to this country\".Australia's Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the government will \"continue to use every tool we have available to ensure that Australians can be safe and feel safe in their communities\".After the rape in 2014, Van de Velde returned to the Netherlands but in 2016, he was extradited to the UK and arrested. Ahead of his sentencing, the court heard he was aware of the girl's age.He served 12 months of his four-year sentence and restarted his professional sporting career in 2018, playing for his national team in several global tournaments.Last year, he represented the Netherlands at the Paris Olympics and was booed by some people in the crowd. Earlier, an online petition calling for him to be banned from the Olympics had attracted 90,000 signatures.The BBC has contacted the organisers of the world championship event in South Australia and the Dutch national volleyball association for comment.

    "body": "1 hour agoLaura GozziGetty ImagesTiphaine Auzière is one of Brigitte Macron's three childrenBrigitte Macron's daughter has told a court in Paris that sexist cyber-bullying negatively affected her mother's health and living conditions.Tiphaine Auzière, 41, is the step-daughter of French President Emmanuel Macron. She took the stand on the second and final day of the trial of 10 people accused of spreading unsubstantiated claims over Brigitte Macron's gender and sexuality.Mrs Macron, 72, has long been the target of conspiracy theories which allege she is a transgender woman.\"It is important to be here today to express the harm my mother has faced. I wanted to give an account of what her life has been like since the moment she started being targeted by these attacks,\" Ms Auzière said. She added she had noticed a change and a \"deterioration\" in her mother's health since claims around her gender and sexuality began swirling. Mrs Macron \"has had to be careful about her choices of outfits, of posture... She knows perfectly well that her image will be used to back these theories,\" Ms Auzière said. She said that not a day went by that the claims were not somehow reported to her mother - \"even by someone who means well and feels for her\". While her mother had \"learned to live with it\", Ms Auzière said, she suffered from the repercussions on her grandchildren who were taunted at school.\"She hasn't been elected, she hasn't asked anything of anyone, and she comes under attack.\"Prosecutors are seeking suspended prison terms of three months to 12 months for the accused, and fines of up to €8,000 ($9,300). Getty ImagesBrigitte and Emmanuel Macron married in 2007, when he was 29 and she was 54Among the defendants - all aged 41 to 65 - are an elected official, a gallery owner and a teacher.One - a man named Aurélien Poirson-Atlan - is accused of telling his 200,000 online followers that Mrs Macron is a transgender woman and that the 24-year age gap between her and Emmanuel Macron amounts to \"state-sanctioned paedophilia\".Mr Poirson-Atlan told the court on Tuesday that he was a \"satirist\" who had just wished to put forward \"a point of view different to that of the mainstream media\". Two other defendants - self-styled independent journalist Natacha Rey and internet fortune-teller Amandine Roy – were already found guilty of slander last year for claiming that France's first lady had never existed, and that her brother had changed gender and started using her name. They were later acquitted by a court of appeals.Other defendants also said they had employed their \"freedom of expression\". One requested the Macrons publish photos of Brigitte Macron pregnant to prove she is a biological woman. The Macrons have already said they will present such evidence in court proceedings against US right-wing influencer Candace Owens. Owens has repeatedly promoted her view that Brigitte Macron is a man and in March 2024, she claimed she would stake her \"entire professional reputation\" on the allegation.Earlier this year the Macrons' lawyer in the case, Tom Clare, told the BBC the couple would present photographic and scientific evidence to a US court to prove Mrs Macron is a woman.\"It is incredibly upsetting to think that you have to go and subject yourself, to put this type of proof forward,\" he said.Mrs Macron first met her now-husband when she was a teacher at his secondary school.The couple ended up marrying in 2007, when Mr Macron was 29 and Mrs Macron was 54.",

    "body": "20 hours agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology Correspondent, San FranciscoOpenAI has released new estimates of the number of ChatGPT users who exhibit possible signs of mental health emergencies, including mania, psychosis or suicidal thoughts.The company said that around 0.07% of ChatGPT users active in a given week exhibited such signs, adding that its artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot recognizes and responds to these sensitive conversations.While OpenAI maintains these cases are \"extremely rare,\" critics said even a small percentage may amount to hundreds of thousands of people, as ChatGPT recently reached 800 million weekly active users, per boss Sam Altman.As scrutiny mounts, the company said it built a network of experts around the world to advise it.Those experts include more than 170 psychiatrists, psychologists, and primary care physicians who have practiced in 60 countries, the company said.They have devised a series of responses in ChatGPT to encourage users to seek help in the real world, according to OpenAI.But the glimpse at the company's data raised eyebrows among some mental health professionals.\"Even though 0.07% sounds like a small percentage, at a population level with hundreds of millions of users, that actually can be quite a few people,\" said Dr. Jason Nagata, a professor who studies technology use among young adults at the University of California, San Francisco.\"AI can broaden access to mental health support, and in some ways support mental health, but we have to be aware of the limitations,\" Dr. Nagata added.The company also estimates 0.15% of ChatGPT users have conversations that include \"explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.\"OpenAI said recent updates to its chatbot are designed to \"respond safely and empathetically to potential signs of delusion or mania\" and note \"indirect signals of potential self-harm or suicide risk.\"ChatGPT has also been trained to reroute sensitive conversations \"originating from other models to safer models\" by opening in a new window.In response to questions by the BBC on criticism about the numbers of people potentially affected, OpenAI said that this small percentage of users amounts to a meaningful amount of people and noted they are taking changes seriously. The changes come as OpenAI faces mounting legal scrutiny over the way ChatGPT interacts with users.In one of the most high-profile lawsuits recently filed against OpenAI, a California couple sued the company over the death of their teenage son alleging that ChatGPT encouraged him to take his own life in April.The lawsuit was filed by the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine and was the first legal action accusing OpenAI of wrongful death.In a separate case, the suspect in a murder-suicide that took place in August in Greenwich, Connecticut posted hours of his conversations with ChatGPT, which appear to have fuelled the alleged perpetrator's delusions.More users struggle with AI psychosis as \"chatbots create the illusion of reality,\" said Professor Robin Feldman, Director of the AI Law & Innovation Institute at the University of California Law. \"It is a powerful illusion.\"She said OpenAI deserved credit for \"sharing statistics and for efforts to improve the problem\" but added: \"the company can put all kinds of warnings on the screen but a person who is mentally at risk may not be able to heed those warnings.\" ",

    "body": "A man accused of killing former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial.Tetsuya Yamagami, 45, told a court in the capital Tokyo that \"everything is true\", according to local media. Yamagami used a homemade gun to shoot Abe during a political campaign event in the western city of Nara in 2022.Abe - who was known for his hawkish foreign policy and a signature economic strategy that popularly came to be known as \"Abenomics\" - was struck several times, and died in hospital later the same day, sending shockwaves around the world.The assassination shone a spotlight on links between Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Unification Church, more popularly known as the \"Moonies\".Yamagami is reported to have told investigators he targeted Abe because he blamed the 67-year-old for allegedly promoting the church, which he said had bankrupted his mother and the wider family.He alleged his mother made donations, said to total about 100 million yen ($660,000), as proof of her faith to the church.The allegations prompted investigations into the church, which started in South Korea and is known for its mass weddings, and led to four ministers resigning.Then, in March this year, a Tokyo court ordered the disbandment of the church, stripping it of its tax exempt status and requiring it to liquidate its assets. But Yamagami's mother - who is expected to be called as a witness - has reportedly not wavered in her beliefs, telling Japanese media that the killing has made her faith stronger, according to the Japan Times.Yamagami's trial is not expected to conclude until January, with the defendant denying charges relating to violation of arms control laws. His lawyer told the court the homemade weapon did not fall into the correct category, Japan's NHK said.Japan, which has very low levels of gun violence, has further strengthened its laws around homemade guns since Abe's killing.",

The aircraft was flying from the popular beach resort of Diani to an airstrip in the world-famous Maasai Mara game park when it went down at 05:30 local time (02:30 GMT), the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) said. Mombasa Air Safari said the plane was carrying eight Hungarians, two Germans and a Kenyan pilot, all of whom had been killed in the crash. \"Our primary focus right now is on providing all possible support to the families affected,\" it added in a statement.Local media have published images of the plane in flames, with debris scattered at the site of the crash.Kwale County Commissioner Stephen Orinde told the BBC that the plane crashed about 10km (six miles) from Kwale town after flying out of Diani.It was on its way to Kichwa Tembo, an airstrip in Maasai Mara, popular with holidaymakers because of its wildlife. \"The passengers were all tourists,\" Orinde said.He said that investigations into the cause of the crash were ongoing but suggested it could have been due to bad weather.\"The weather is not very good here at the moment. Since early in the morning, it is raining and it is very misty, but we cannot preempt [the findings],\" Orinde said.In August, a light aircraft belonging to the medical charity Amref crashed on the outskirts of the capital, Nairobi, killing six people and injuring two others.",

    "body": "2 hours agoLaura Gozzi,London and Abdujalil Abdurasulov,WarsawRussian troops are making a concerted push in eastern Ukraine and have gained a foothold in the strategic hub of Pokrovsk, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says. Moscow's soldiers outnumber Kyiv's 8-1 in the area and Ukraine cannot match that, Zelensky added while insisting Russia had not yet \"achieved the planned result\". Russia has been trying to capture Pokrovsk for two years. The key supply and transport hub provides supplies and reinforcements to the eastern front - and it would get Moscow closer to occupying the entirety of the Donetsk region. It would also put towns of the heavily fortified \"fortress belt\" - Kramatorsk, Slovyansk, Kostyantynivka and Druzhkivka - within easier reach of Moscow. Zelensky said drone imagery showed that around 200 Russian soldiers were inside Pokrovsk. Describing the situation as \"difficult\", he said earlier that there was widespread fierce fighting and \"sabotage groups\" had entered the town. However, he rejected reports by Russia's Chief of General Staff, Gen Valery Gerasimov, that Ukrainian troops had been completely surrounded. In an update on Tuesday, Russia's defence ministry said its forces had encircled Ukrainian troops around the main railway station and cleared the city's Troyanda district of Ukrainian forces.One soldier from Ukraine's 155th Brigade, Artem Pribylnov, rejected the notion that Ukrainian troops had been encircled in a \"cauldron\" at Pokrovsk.\"But the war has changed and it's very technological now,\" he said. In previous assaults there had been a path out of the cauldron that troops could drive in and out of, he said, but now drones controlled access points, which made it \"extremely dangerous\".\"Perhaps that's why Russians claim they've encircled Pokrovsk even if there is no physical encirclement of the city?\" he suggested.According to Capt Hryhoriy Shapoval, spokesperson of Ukraine's East operational group, 79 attacks had been repelled near Pokrovsk since Monday - almost a third of the total 218 assaults recorded across the entire front line.He said that Russian troops had concentrated a large number of troops and equipment near Pokrovsk and that they were using armoured vehicles to cover their infantry. \"So it's hard to stop them,\" he said.He added that Kyiv's troops normally used drones to counter the Russians' advance but foggy and rainy weather conditions had made it harder to detect and destroy infantry troops.The situation in and around Pokrovsk exemplifies the high cost of shifting the front line forward, even just by a few metres. Last week, Ukrainian media reported that Russian forces were engaging in street battles and targeting Ukrainian positions, including drone operators.Away from the towns, drone technology means both Russian and Ukrainian forces are able to pound one another deep on either side of the front line.Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 is almost into its fifth year. Moscow's troops currently occupy about 20% of Ukrainian territory. Kyiv's defence capabilities are shrinking and Zelensky has said Ukraine needs  financial support from its European allies to continue fighting Russian forces for another two or three years. European leaders have so far failed to divert €140bn worth of Russian frozen assets to Ukraine - a move which would require complex legal machinations and which was blocked by Belgium at an EU summit last week. The proposal will be revisited in December.Zelensky said he had told his European counterparts that while Ukraine was \"not going to fight for decades... you must show that for some time you will be able to provide stable financial support to Ukraine\".The Ukrainian president also said he hoped a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday would result in a decision by China to cut its support for Russia. Last week Trump slapped Lukoil and Rosneft - two major Russian oil companies - with sanctions, and urged Turkey and China to halt purchases of Russian oil in a bid to put economic pressure on the Kremlin.\"I think this may be one of [Trump's] strong moves, especially if, following this decisive sanctions step, China is ready to reduce imports\" from Russia, Zelensky told journalists earlier this week.",

    "body": "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is suing the makers of Tylenol, claiming the companies hid alleged dangers that the drug posed to children's brain development. The lawsuit comes a month after President Donald Trump promoted an unproven link between taking Tylenol - also known as paracetamol - during pregnancy and autism in children.  Paxton is suing Johnson & Johnson, which previously sold the drug, the only pain reliever recommended for pregnant women, and Kenvue, which now manufacturers it.  In a statement, he said they \"betrayed America by profiting off of pain and pushing pills regardless of the risks.\"Kenvue says there is no credible evidence tying Tylenol to autism.\"These corporations lied for decades, knowingly endangering millions to line their pockets,\" Paxton, a Republican, said.Kenvue said in a statement that it was \"deeply concerned by the perpetuation of misinformation on the safety of acetaminophen and the potential impact that could have on the health of American women and children\".On its website, Kenvue also said it had \"continuously evaluated the relevant science and there is no credible data that shows a proven link between taking acetaminophen and autism\". Organizations representing doctors and healthcare providers agree. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has said acetaminophen - the main ingredient in Tylenol - is one of the few options for pregnant women to treat pain and fever, which can pose serious health risks if left untreated. \"In more than two decades of research on the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy, not a single reputable study has successfully concluded that the use of acetaminophen in any trimester of pregnancy causes neurodevelopmental disorders in children,\" the group said. The lawsuit cites recent announcements from the Trump administration in arguing the drug is allegedly unsafe.Last month, Trump raised alarms from public health officials when he told pregnant women to \"fight like hell\" not to take Tylenol when ill. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) then issued a notice that doctors should consider limiting the use of Tylenol, while also stating that \"a causal relationship\" between the drug and autism in children has not been established. Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, who oversees the FDA, had pledged in April to undertake \"a massive testing and research effort\" that would determine the cause of autism in a matter of months. But experts cautioned that finding a single cause of autism - thought by researchers to be the result of a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors - would not be simple. Autism is a form of lifelong neurodivergence and disability that affects how people experience and interact with the world, and is diagnosed using doctors' observations.In his court filing, Paxton - a Trump ally who is running for US Senate - alleges Kenvue and Johnson & Johnson \"willfully ignored and attempted to silence the science\" around acetaminophen and autism. The lawsuit seeks to make the companies \"destroy any marketing or advertising\" that claims Tylenol is safe for pregnant women. The Texas lawsuit echoes the complaints of a group of parents of children with autism and ADHD who sued the makers of Tylenol in 2022.  A federal judge dismissed the case, saying research from the parents' expert witnesses was not conclusive. ",

    "body": "A statue of a Confederate general that was torn down and set on fire in 2020 during social justice protests in Washington has been reinstalled under orders from President Donald Trump. General Albert Pike's statue has long been a source of controversy, as have many Confederate monuments across the US which were erected decades after the Civil War.The National Park Service announced in August its plan to return the refurbished statue, after Trump signed an executive order called \"Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History\".Democratic Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents the District of Columbia, called the restoration  “offensive to members of the military who serve honorably”.On Monday afternoon,  videos showed the area surrounding Pike's statue in Washington with a sign that read  \"Area close. Historic preservation work in progress\". \"The restoration aligns with federal responsibilities under historic-preservation law and recent executive orders to beautify the nation’s capital and restore pre-existing statues,\"  the National Park Service in a statement.These confederate statues caused US protests. Knocked down, they're the centre of a new art showThe statue, which was built in 1901, has been a source of controversy for many years. Members of local government have been calling for its removal for decades. Holmes Norton, a long-time critic, has introduced legislation to remove the Pike statue permanently multiple times. \"Pike himself served dishonourably,\" she said in a statement after the statue was restored. \"He took up arms against the United States, misappropriated funds, and was ultimately captured and imprisoned by his own troops.\"\"Confederate statues should be placed in museums as historical artifacts, not remain in parks or other locations that imply honor,\" Holmes Norton added. Pike's statue was the only monument to a Confederate general in the nation's capital before it was pulled down in 2020.Pike was a longtime leader of the Freemasons, a centuries-old secretive society, who paid for the statue. His body is interred at the Washington headquarters of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, which also contains a small museum in his honour.Pike's critics have accused him of being instrumental in the formation of the Ku Klux Klan. Masons insist that evidence doesn't support the allegations.The plaque that previously labelled the statue read \"author, poet, scholar, soldier, jurist, orator, philanthropist and philosopher\". Anti-racism protesters used ropes and chains to pull down the Pike statue following the murder of  George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of a police officer in 2020.Then-President Trump, in his first term, condemned the toppling on Twitter, writing: \"The DC police are not doing their job as they watched a statue be ripped down and burn. These people should be immediately arrested. A disgrace to our country.\"Floyd's death ignited a nationwide reckoning with systemic racism, prompting widespread calls to remove Confederate monuments. Ultimately, more than 300 such memorials were taken down across the country.Since returning to the White House, Trump has ordered statues and paintings of Confederate generals to be reinstalled. ",

She is due in court again on Monday.In May, she was stopped at Tbilisi International Airport after 12kg (26lb) of marijuana and 2kg (4.4lb) of hashish were found in her luggage. Miss Culley  previously claimed she was tortured to bring the drugs.Under the plea bargain agreement, her family paid 500,000 Georgian Lari (£137,000) to reduce her sentence.More than 90% of drug-related crimes in Georgia are resolved through plea bargains.ReutersLyanne Kennedy, speaking to reporters outside court, said her 19-year-old daughter was \"looking strong\"Speaking outside court, her mother said: \"We've confirmed that the funds have been sent but they need to confirm that they have been received and that is not going to happen until tomorrow.\"She is looking big, pregnant, but she is looking strong.\"Malkhaz Salakaia, representing Miss Culley, said the negotiations \"are nearing completion\".\"Plea bargain conditions are known to the family,\" he said.\"There is a technical issue to be resolved which will take a few days.\"Mr Salakaia previously said he planned to appeal to the president of Georgia to pardon her after finalising the plea deal.Rayhan Demytrie/BBCBella Culley is being detained at prison number 5Miss Culley initially went missing in Thailand before being arrested at Tbilisi International Airport on 10 May.It is understood she arrived on a flight from Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates and police seized drugs from a travel bag.At a hearing in July, she pleaded not guilty to charges of possession and trafficking illegal drugs and claimed she had been \"forced to do this through torture\".\"I just wanted to travel,\" she said. \"I am a good person.

    "body": "20 hours agoCherylann Mollan, BBC News and Vishnukant Tiwari, BBC HindiBhopal, Madhya PradeshBBCAarish says he's worried about missing work after losing vision in his left eyeAarish, 15, sits on a hospital bed in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. A pair of dark glasses hides a painful injury in his left eye.His cornea was damaged a week ago when an improvised firecracker device that he bought to celebrate the Diwali festival exploded near his face, causing him to lose vision in one eye. He has undergone emergency surgery and his doctor says only time will tell how much sight he can regain.The teenager, who doesn't go to school, says he's most worried about missing work - his father works as a gardener and Aarish repairs televisions to supplement the family income. Child labour is illegal in India, but millions of children work. Indian law allows children above 14 years to work in some industries which are seen as non-hazardous.Aarish is among hundreds of children and young adults from at least five states across northern India who have suffered serious eye injuries from using the same kind of device - called \"carbide guns\" - during Diwali.The \"carbide gun\", a rudimentary device, using calcium carbide in a plastic pipe, gives dramatic results  - a loud blast that sounds like a gunshot, accompanied by fiery sparks. But the explosion is unpredictable and often delayed - officials told the BBC that many of the injuries occurred when children peeped inside the pipe to check just as the blast happened.The sale and purchase of calcium carbide is regulated in India, but farmers and shopkeepers often use it to artificially ripen fruit. Police officials also say the crude guns are sometimes used to scare away animals from fields.But many in India had not heard of these guns until last week, when a spate of injuries was reported after Diwali. Officials said these devices began flooding local markets in northern India after viral social media videos showed them being used as firecrackers.Karan, 14, went through surgery at Hamidia Hospital in BhopalMore than 100 cases of carbide gun-related eye injuries have been reported in Madhya Pradesh's Bhopal district alone, with at least 15 requiring surgery. Another 100 cases have been reported from three other districts. In Bihar state, 170 cases have been reported, with 40 requiring surgery, says Dr Bibhuti Prassan Sinha, who heads the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology in Patna city. The actual numbers are likely to be higher, he added.Cases have also been reported from the states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, as well as capital Delhi. Some states, including Madhya Pradesh, have now banned the use of carbide guns as firecrackers and several sellers have been arrested.Kavitha Kumar, head of ophthalmology at Hamidia Hospital in Bhopal, says that patients have been coming in with mild, moderate and severe eye injuries.\"In milder cases, skin on the eye and around it has sustained chemical injuries and thermal burns. In moderate cases, chemical particulate matter has caused mild damage to the cornea and in severe cases, there's extensive damage to the cornea, causing temporary vision loss. With surgery, the patient may be able to regain their sight over time,\" she says. Some doctors told the BBC that they were shocked by the severity of the injuries. Dr Aditi Dubey from Hamidia Hospital said that she had never seen chemical injuries caused by Diwali firecrackers and had to research what \"carbide guns\" were.Many patients said that they bought the gun after seeing it on Instagram Reels and YouTube videos. An attractive aspect was the price - at 150-200 rupees ($1.70-$2; £1.28-£1.70) a piece, it was a relatively cheap firecracker that promised to make a big impact.A search for the term \"carbide gun\" on Instagram and YouTube throws up dozens of videos of young people making and using these devices, often accompanied by rap music. Carbide guns began popping up in local markets in the weeks before DiwaliSome accounts have also termed these videos \"science experiments\" with hashtags like \"useful project\" and \"experiment video\".Dr Sinha told the BBC that one of his patients was an engineering student who made the gun at home after watching such videos. He's currently being treated after losing vision in one of his eyes.Calcium carbide is a regulated substance in India - its possession, use and manufacturing are controlled by law because of its harmful effects and potential for abuse.When it comes in contact with water, it produces acetylene gas, which is highly flammable and has damaging properties on health.Under the Calcium Carbide Rules, 1987, a licence is needed for its sale, purchase and storage - but only for quantities above 200kg.A government official in Bhopal who didn't want to be named told the BBC that calcium carbide is still widely used to artificially ripen fruit despite a federal ban as it contains traces of poisonous substances.Alzain and his mother, Afreen, at Hamidia HospitalHarinarayanachari Mishra, Police Commissioner of Bhopal, told the BBC that carbide guns are also used in northern India during wedding festivities and by farmers to drive away monkeys.Dr Partha Biswas, president of the All India Ophthalmological Society, says carbide guns should be banned urgently.\"It's a national problem. And the seriousness of these incidents shouldn't be minimised as mere \"accidents\" that took place during the Diwali festival,\" he says.He adds that there's potential for these guns to be used as firecrackers during other festivals and events, like when India wins a cricket match or during New Year.\"These crude 'carbide bombs' or 'carbide guns' can cause permanent blindness, disfigurement and disability,\" he says, demanding a nationwide crackdown on manufacturers and sellers of the guns as well as more control over the supply chain of calcium carbide.Back at Hamidia Hospital, Alzain, whose left eye was operated on after he lost his vision, sits inside the tight embrace of his mother. The seven-year-old had pestered his uncle to buy the gun after watching videos on YouTube. Alzain's worried mother, Afreen, hasn't left his bedside since he was admitted a week ago.\"I'm scared for his future,\" she says. \"I hope he's able to see again.\"",

    "body": "12 minutes agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseUS Department of DefenseOne person survived the strikes and was rescued by Mexican search-and-rescue teams. US forces have killed 14 people in strikes on four alleged drug boats in the Pacific, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said.Mexico's navy says it is still searching for a lone survivor approximately 400 miles (643km) from the Pacific coastal city of Acapulco. It is the latest in a series of attacks on boats the US says have been carrying drugs in both the Pacific and Caribbean.The latest strikes in the eastern Pacific, which Hegseth said happened on Monday at the direction of President Donald Trump, mark an escalation in what it has cast as a campaign to stop narcotics from entering the US.The strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. Members of the US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have also raised concerns and questioned the president's authority to order them.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum told her morning press conference \"we do not agree with these attacks\".  She said she had asked the country's foreign minister, as well as representatives of the navy, to meet the US ambassador.\"We want all international treaties to be respected,\" she added. At least 57 people have now been killed in the strikes, which has led to increasing tensions between the US and the governments of both Colombia and Venezuela. Most strikes have taken place off the coast of South America, in the Caribbean, but recently the US has turned its attention to the Pacific Ocean as well.In a statement on X, Hegseth said the four vessels that were hit on Monday \"were known by our intelligence apparatus, transitioning along known narco-trafficking routes and carrying narcotics\".He added that eight \"narco-terrorists\" were killed in the first strike. Four and three were killed in the following two strikes. ANALYSIS: What is Trump's endgame in Venezuela?One person survived the strikes. According to Hegseth, Mexican search-and-rescue authorities \"accepted the case and assumed responsibility for coordinating the rescue.\" The condition of the survivor or his current whereabouts are unclear. Mexico's navy said in a statement that it had dispatched a patrol boat and an aircraft to conduct search operations to \"safeguard human life at sea\". Hegseth's post included videos that show several vessels catching fire after being struck by US munitions. \"The department has spent over two decades defending other homelands,\" he wrote. \"Now, we're defending our own.\" At least four of the strikes have so far taken place in the Pacific, which is a far more significant drug-trafficking corridor, with the rest taking place in the Caribbean. President Trump has said he has the legal authority to continue bombing boats in international waters, but suggested last week that he may seek approval from Congress if the campaign is expanded to include targets on land. Trump has said he is \"totally prepared\" to strike land-based targets, which would mark a significant escalation in the campaign.The strikes, however, have drawn criticism from international law experts and both the Venezuelan and Colombian governments. Mary Ellen O'Connell, an international law expert at Notre Dame University and former military educator with the defence department, said the \"criminal suspects are entitled to due process\".\"It is a greater crime to summarily execute people suspected of drug trafficking than drug trafficking is,\" she added. In an interview with the BBC's Newsday programme last week, Colombian Deputy Foreign Minister Mauricio Jaramillo said the strikes were \"disproportionate and outside international law\".Jaramillo said those on the vessels had \"no possibility to defend themselves\" and were struck with \"no process\" and \"no judicial order\". The strikes also come as tensions ratchet up with both governments. The US has placed sanctions on Colombian president Gustavo Petro, accusing him of failing to curb drug trafficking and allowing cartels to \"flourish\".In the Caribbean, the US has deployed troops, aircraft and naval vessels and last week ordered the world's largest warship - the USS Gerald R Ford - to the area. Trump has accused Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organisation, which he denies, and there are fears in Venezuela that the US military build-up is aimed at removing the long-time opponent of Trump from power.The country's attorney general told the BBC there is \"no doubt\" that Trump is trying to overthrow the Venezuelan government. He accused the US of hoping to seize the country's natural resources, including reserves of gold, oil and copper.The US is among many nations that do not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader, after the last election in 2024 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair. Opposition tallies from polling stations showed its candidate had won by a landslide.Watch: The US is \"fabricating an eternal war\", says Nicolás Maduro",

    "body": "8 hours agoLiv McMahon,Technology reporter and Osmond Chia,Business reporterAmazon has confirmed it plans to cut thousands of jobs, saying it needs to be \"organised more leanly\" to seize the opportunity provided by artificial intelligence (AI).The tech giant said on Tuesday it would reduce its global corporate workforce by \"approximately 14,000 roles\".Earlier reporting had suggested it was planning to lay off as many as 30,000 workers.Beth Galetti, a senior vice president at Amazon, wrote in a note to staff that the move would make the company \"even stronger\" by shifting resources \"to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs\".She acknowledged that some would question the move given the company was performing well.At the end of July, Amazon reported second quarter results which beat Wall Street expectations on several counts, including a 13% year over year increase in sales to $167.7bn (£125bn).But Ms Galetti said the cuts were needed because AI was \"the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet\" and was \"enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.\"\"We're convicted that we need to be organised more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,\" she added.The note, shared with Amazon employees earlier on Tuesday, said the company was \"working hard to support everyone whose role is impacted\" - including by helping those affected find new roles within Amazon.Those who cannot will receive \"transition support\" including severance pay, it said.The BBC has asked if it will affect employees in the UK.The company has more than 1.5 million employees across its warehouses and offices worldwide.This includes around 350,000 corporate workers, which include those in executive, managerial and sales roles, according to figures that Amazon submitted to the US government last year.Like many technology firms, Amazon hired aggressively during the Covid-19 pandemic to meet the surge in demand for online deliveries and digital services.Amazon boss Andy Jassy has since focused on reducing spending as the company invests heavily in AI tools to boost efficiency.Mr Jassy said in June that the increase in AI tools will likely lead to job cuts as machines take over routine tasks.\"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,\" he said then.Amazon has carried out several rounds of cuts to its corporate division in recent years.It laid off around 27,000 workers over several months in 2022, as rivals similarly looked to reverse hiring increases made during the pandemic.After the company posted its latest financial results in July, its more subdued profit guidance for the forthcoming quarter left some sceptical of whether - or when -  its enormous AI investments would pay off.Slower growth for its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), compared to rivals Microsoft and Google, also sparked concern among some investors.Amazon will report its latest results on Thursday for the period ending 30 September.Ben Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said the wider industry would be watching Amazon closely as it embarked on its latest round of cuts.\"We are already seeing jobs in software development be shed thanks to the capabilities of some of these AI tools, and the big companies will be looking to redistribute and restructure their workforces accordingly,\" he told the BBC. \"They have the data and can apply AI in a way that unfortunately means job losses are inevitable.\"Additional reporting by Philippa Wain",

    "body": "Rare earths, Nobel nomination and cheers: Trump ends Japan leg of Asia tour10 hours agoAnthony Zurcher,North America correspondent and Shaimaa Khalil,Tokyo correspondentWatch: Trump addresses cheering troops on US carrier in JapanPraise, Nobel nominations and promises of foreign investment in the US - Japan's newly-elected Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi rolled out the red carpet for Donald Trump on Tuesday.Trump in turn had warm praise for Takaichi, telling her that the US would be there for \"anything you want, any favours you need, anything… to help Japan\".The two leaders signed a deal on rare earth minerals, as well as a document heralding a new \"golden age\" of US-Japan relations which reiterated the commitment of the two countries to implement deals struck earlier, including the 15% tariff deal negotiated earlier this year.The pageantry and the venue also seemed tailor-made for the US president.A full military guard of honour and band welcomed Trump to the ornate Akasaka Palace, with its vaulted ceilings and gold-encrusted walls not unlike what the president wants in his planned White House ballroom.Over lunch, Trump congratulated Takaichi for becoming Japan's first female prime minister.Notably, according to a White House readout, that lunch was \"American rice and American beef, deliciously made with Japanese ingredients\" - a move that will no doubt have delighted Trump, who has long demanded that Japan buy rice from the US.China controls the rare earths the world buys - can Trump's new deals change that?Takaichi also accompanied Trump aboard a US aircraft carrier, the USS George Washington, where they were greeted by thousands of cheering American troops. Takaichi took the stage and praised what she called the  \"greatest alliance in the world\" and pledged to increase defence spending.Trump has in the past criticised Japan's lack of defence spending. In April this year, he lambasted a security treaty with Japan as being \"one-sided\", saying: \"We pay billions of dollars to defend them, but they don't pay anything.\"Ahead of their meeting on Wednesday, Trump said he was sure that he would have a \"fantastic relationship\" with Takaichi, who had a strong connection with former PM Shinzo Abe, a Trump favourite who was shot dead in 2022.\"She was a great ally and friend of Abe, who was my friend… He was one of the best… I know they were very close, and I think philosophically they were close, which is very good,\" he told reporters while flying over to Japan from Malaysia on Tuesday.Trump is spending a week in Asia. He will leave Japan for South Korea on Wednesday, and is expected to meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping there on Thursday.Getty ImagesDonald Trump met Sanae Takaichi, Japan's new prime minister, on the visitThe meeting with Trump was seen as a critical early test for Takaichi, who was elected as prime minister by Japanese lawmakers earlier this month.Both countries have long been allies, but navigating a relationship with a fickle Trump, who has in the past appeared to waver in his commitment to Japan, lies at the core of the country's foreign policy.On Wednesday, Takaichi described Trump as a \"partner in a new golden era\", and praised his role in bringing peace to the Middle East. She announced that Japan would be nominating him for the Nobel peace prize.She also presented Trump with a collection of golf-related gifts, according to Trump's assistant Margo Martin.These included a golf bag signed by Hideki Matsuyama, the first male Japanese golfer to win a major golf championship, as well as a putter used by Abe. They also signed two caps printed with the words: Japan is back.In turn, Trump described her as a \"close friend\" and described the US alliance with Japan as a \"beautiful friendship\" that was \"born out of the ashes of a terrible war\". He also announced he had approved the first delivery of long-awaited US missiles for F-35 fighter jets to Japan, which would take place this week.Pleasantries have set a positive tone to the meetings so far,  but behind the smiles and the pagentary, there is real pressure on Japan.During the working lunch, Takaichi presented Trump with a map showing the investments that Japanese companies have made in the US. And during his speech on the USS George Washington, Trump said Takaichi had told him earlier about plans for Toyota to put $10bn (£7.5bn) into building plants \"all over\" the US.But Trump also wants more access to Japan's markets - not just getting them to buy more rice, but also soybeans, and to open its market to US vehicles.Getty ImagesThe US president was hosted in the ornate Akasaka PalaceBut Takaichi also needs to protect domestic industries and doesn't want to anger crucial interest groups at home, like the powerful farming lobby.Tokyo is heavily reliant on exports, and cannot afford a tariff fight especially when it comes to its auto industry. Automakers - the country's largest exporters to the US - faced 24% tariffs and tens of billions of dollars in losses.Tariffs have now been lowered to 15%, in step with rivals in the region such as South Korea.Tomohiko Taniguchi - former special adviser to  Abe - said there were things that Takaichi could draw on from Trump's relationship with her late mentor. He said it was important for Takaichi to be \"straightforward and say bluntly what Japan's national interests are, and to see where those two nations national interests overlap, and always mindful that Japan's safety must be in hands of the Japanese\".But Takaichi won't just have to balance Japan's interests and its alliance with the US – she'll also have to do that while maintaining the country's crucial trade partnership with China.Rintaro Nishimura senior associate at the Asia Group said: \"Takaichi will have to walk a very fine line, maybe tone down some of her more hawkish tendencies on China... but also assure Trump that the US-Japan relationship is the most important.\"",

    "body": "The Indian village which saw the  homecoming of one of the world's oldest rebels20 hours agoSoutik BiswasIndia correspondentAPAfter more than 60 years, Thuingaleng Muivah returned to his native village in Manipur last weekLast week, a helicopter appeared over the green, folded hills of Ukhrul in India's north-eastern state of Manipur.By the time it touched down on a makeshift helipad outside Somdal village, the crowd had already begun to sing. When the door opened, the crowd surged towards a frail man in dark glasses and a black suit. Quickly, they draped him in a traditional shawl.After more than half a century, Thuingaleng Muivah, India's oldest rebel, had come home.  Now 91, Mr Muivah is the general secretary of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah), or NSCN (I-M), the most powerful of the Naga insurgent factions that once fought the Indian state in one of Asia's longest-running rebellions - though today the organisation is often regarded as a shadow of its former self.His supporters see him as the keeper of a demand India has never recognised - a separate state for Naga people. His critics remember something else: a movement accused of targeted killings and running a parallel government in Nagaland through \"taxes\" many call extortion - allegations the NSCN (I-M) denies.Nagaland, a largely Christian state wedged between Myanmar and Bangladesh, is home to a people spread across neighbouring Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam states. Muivah seeks either full sovereignty or a \"Greater Nagaland\" uniting Nagas across borders, especially in Manipur.Muivah himself was born in what is now Manipur state  - a reminder that the Naga identity extends far beyond Nagaland's borders.This was his second attempt to return home - the first, in 2010, was blocked by the Manipur government, which cited the risk of unrest and security concerns. When he finally made it back with his wife last week, almost the entire village gathered to welcome the Avakharar - the \"eldest father\", as they called him. Among them was his only surviving sibling, 84-year-old Asui Muivah.\"Generation comes and goes, but the nation stays,\" he wrote in a message read aloud by his deputy, VS Atem, as he was too weak to speak himself. \"The issue we are fighting for is greater and older than most of us.\"APHundreds had gathered to welcome Muivah, the general secretary of the most powerful Naga insurgent faction called NSCN (I-M)Muivah had left this same hillside village in 1964, trekking east to join the Naga struggle for sovereignty - a journey that would take him to the jungles of northern Myanmar, the ideological camps of Maoist China and the negotiation tables of Delhi. After coming out of the jungles for a ceasefire in 1997, Muivah has lived in Delhi and a sprawling camp in Hebron in Nagaland, which serves as the NSCN (I-M)'s headquarters, complete with signs declaring, \"Freedom is the birthright of all nations\". \"His return to his village is more personal than political - driven by a longing for home. His calls for a separate Naga flag and a constitution are expected, and they help keep him politically relevant. But the broader idea of 'Greater Nagaland' has largely faded over the years,\" says Pradip Phanjoubam, editor-in-chief of the Imphal Review of Arts and Politics.The Naga struggle predates India itself. In 1918, returning World War One labourers formed the Naga Club to assert a distinct identity. When India became independent in 1947, Naga leaders refused to join the new republic, declaring, \"We are not Indians\", and held their own unrecognised plebiscite for independence in 1951.As armed conflict began to intensify, the Indian government sent in troops in 1955. What followed was decades of insurgency, factional splits and ceasefires. The rebellion claimed thousands of lives, displaced generations and militarised the lush, Christian-majority hills. \"The Naga conflict,\" says political scientist Sanjib Baruah, \"is among the world's least-known but longest-running armed movements.\"Muivah was born in March 1935 in Somdal, where his family often went hungry. Educated at a local Christian school, he was drawn early to the ideas of revolution and Naga nationalism. By his teens, Muivah was already a Naga nationalist, singing \"God Bless My Nagaland\" at school and questioning why his people lived in \"humiliation\" under the colonial government. After studying at St Anthony's College in Shillong and reading Marx, Hegel and Rousseau, he joined the Naga National Council (NNC) - the first political organisation of the Nagas to demand independence from India - in 1964.APPeople waved the Naga flag - the symbol of an unfulfilled political dream - as they waited for Muivah's arrival last weekTwo years later, 31-year-old Muivah joined more than 130 guerrillas on a 97-day trek through the jungles of northern Myanmar to China's Yunnan province. \"We carried our own rice and slept on grass in clearings,\" he said in a 1998 interview. \"I could stand the hunger, but sometimes there was no water to drink.\" They crossed rivers on bamboo rafts hacked through thick undergrowth, and trudged on in subzero cold. Beijing trained the rebels in guerrilla warfare, Marxist-Leninist theory and \"people's war\". Muivah studied briefly in Beijing's College of Diplomacy, visited Vietnam and came back speaking reverently of Mao and Zhou Enlai - though he would later fuse their ideology with a deeply Christian nationalism. He returned to Nagaland after five years.In 1980, Muivah and his comrades Isak Chishi Swu and SS Khaplang founded the NSCN, breaking away from the older NNC that had signed a controversial peace accord with Delhi. Their faction later split again - into the NSCN (I-M) and NSCN (K), led by Khaplang of Myanmar - spawning smaller offshoots across the northeast. At its height, the NSCN (I-M) was the mother of all insurgencies in the region, training and arming smaller ethnic groups and running what India's intelligence agencies called a \"shadow state\" across the hills, according to Subir Bhaumik, a veteran chronicler of the region. The group faced accusations of extortion, killings and human rights abuses.Critics within the Naga insurgency also point to a violent legacy. The Zeliangrong United Front (ZUF) has accused Muivah of ordering \"merciless killings of many prominent leaders\" and carrying out arson in villages \"in the name of taxation or fighting the Indian Army,\" leaving \"common Nagas\" to bear the cost, its spokesperson Louis Gangmei said.Over the years, Muivah transformed from jungle commissar to political negotiator. After decades of exile - in Thailand, the Netherlands and the borderlands of Myanmar -  he entered a ceasefire with India.But his demand for a separate Naga flag and constitution remains a stumbling block. In a interview in 2020, Muivah told journalist Karan Thapar: \"The Nagas will never be part of the Indian Union, nor accept its constitution. There can be no solution without our flag and our constitution.\"The Indian government has offered greater autonomy, but rejects any concession implying sovereignty; the 2015 Framework Agreement, once hailed as a breakthrough, now languishes. \"We have not surrendered our free existence and sovereignty ,\" Muivah declared last week. \"Come what may, we shall defend it to the last.\" APArmed cadres of Muivah's group kept guard as they waited for his arrivalYet over the past decade, as Muivah's health declined and the movement splintered into dozens of factions, the NSCN (I-M)'s once-formidable influence has waned. A younger generation of Nagas, weary of blockades and extortion, now increasingly seeks peace and economic stability. At the same time, experts like Prof Baruah say that the \"proud display of Naga flags in his home village testifies to the vitality and resilience of the Naga movement\"  - a reminder that while its horizons may have narrowed, the sentiment endures.More importantly, he adds, \"even objectively strong states can choose live-and-let-live deals with armed groups rather than trying to disarm and demobilise them\".Muivah says his group has held more than 600 rounds of talks with New Delhi on a Naga homeland since the late 1990s. Yet critics remain unsparing. The Manipur-based ZUF dismissed his return as \"empty-handed,\" arguing there is \"no reason to glorify an individual who failed the Nagas on all fronts.\" Supporters believe he is war-weary, unsure of peace, and still waiting for the political settlement that has defined his life's struggle.As early as 2006, he told Mr Bhaumik, the journalist, \"I am very tired. I feel doubly tired because there seems to be no result coming out of the talks.\" The wait goes on.Additional reporting by Abhishek Dey",

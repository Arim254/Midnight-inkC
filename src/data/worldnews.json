    "body": "23 hours agoJeremy BowenInternational Editor, KyivBBCOn a dark and cold night in Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, the netting protecting the road from attacks by explosive drones shimmered and rippled in the headlights of our armoured Toyota Land Cruiser, as we drove down strange and surreal tunnels to get in and out of the most intensive area of fighting in eastern Ukraine. The nets go on for miles, suspended from wooden poles around 20ft high along the sides and over the top of the road. Dystopian military vehicles straight out of Mad Max rumble past, encased in their own cages of steel and netting.Nets snag the propellers of attacking drones, making them a cheap and surprisingly effective physical barrier. Even if their Russian controllers detonate the charge they carry, there is a chance that the explosion will not be close enough to kill people using the road in civilian buses and cars as well as military vehicles.Much of the netting has been donated by European fishermen. Only this week the Scottish government announced it was sending over another 280 tonnes of salmon nets that were about to be recycled. Before any of it gets used, the Ukrainian military crashes drones into it to test its strength.In Ukraine, anti-drone nets go on for miles, suspended from wooden poles The three most feared letters on the battlefield are FPV, standing for \"first-person view.\" FPV drones are major killers, used by both Ukraine and Russia. They have cameras that feed information back to their controllers in a command centre that might be 30 or 40km away. We visited a few of them, hidden away in basements of wrecked buildings or nondescript village houses.Inside there are banks of screens, relaying video and data from drones that is analysed by the Ukrainian military's leading-edge software. The cameras zoom in on small figures of soldiers moving around the ruins, with the controllers directing the men on the ground through walkie-talkies, callsigns and headsets. We could see the men entering buildings where the drones had seen Russians hiding, and emerging after they had killed them. Early versions of the drones were controlled by radio signals, but both sides are experts at electronic warfare and quickly found ways to jam them. Now they are mostly controlled by fibre optic cables, so thin that a spool 25km long (that carries data and video) fits into a container built into the drone that is the size of a large bottle of bleach.The nets snag the propellers of attacking dronesEastern Ukraine used to feel like a throwback to the Western Front in World War One, with trenches and dugouts reinforced against artillery and snipers. After the full-scale invasion four years ago it still, for a while, felt like a 20th Century battlefield. But now drones have transformed the way the war is fought, and armies across the world are watching closely, being forced to change their ideas of how to fight.The narrow confrontation line that used to exist between the two sides is now extended across a broad swathe of land that both sides call the kill zone, stretching perhaps 20km either side of the forward positions of the two armies. Rear positions for logistics and dealing with casualties that used to be relatively safe are now as lethal as the old front line. The skies above get saturated with surveillance drones, making movement extremely dangerous. Social media feeds are full of terrifying videos filmed from FPV drones as they swoop into their targets, sometimes chasing down individuals in the open, or even entering buildings, threading their way through rooms and doorways until they find their quarry. The last shot is often of a horrified man about to die.Artillery and tanks are still formidable weapons. But a drone that costs around a thousand dollars can, in the hands of a skilled pilot, destroy a tank that costs $30m (£22m). The Wall St Journal recently reported that a small group of Ukrainian drone pilots created havoc when they were invited to oppose Nato forces in an exercise in Estonia last year. Nato has a lot of catching up to do. One major consequence of the last four years of war is that Ukraine and Russia are now the most experienced and proficient practitioners of drone warfare in the world.Both countries are constantly innovating to get ahead in the drone war. Both have been using Starlink system owned by the world's richest man, Elon Musk for battlefield communications and navigation. The Russians had a recent setback when Musk agreed to turn off Russian-registered terminals active inside Ukraine. That seems to be a major reason why Ukraine, with an active Starlink system funded by Poland, recently recaptured territory in the south.But all the Ukrainian drone units I visited believed that the Russians would soon find a workaround. They respect the skills of the elite Russian drone units they said were called Rubicon and Day of Judgement. A senior officer told me that western Europeans need to forget the military blunders Russia made after the full-scale invasion four years ago and make a distinction between the thousands of front-line Russian soldiers who are killed every month and the elite drone units that Moscow values as a key part of their war effort. He said they were \"cherished\" by the Russian army.FPV drones have cameras that feed information back to their controllersOn my most recent visit to Ukraine, the threat from drones meant we watched the weather forecast closely before heading into Donetsk, postponing during a day of clear blue skies and waiting for more snow. Drones struggle in bad weather.Feeling a little reassured by the nets and the snow, we headed towards the town of Slovyansk, past the ruined shells of buildings destroyed over the last four years. Slovyansk functions as a town, just about, with some cafes and shops open. But  thousands of residents have moved to safer places, and when the people who have stayed go out, their fear of Russian FPV drones means they hurry down the icy, snow-covered streets to get through their errands to make it home alive. Nets are going up in the town centre.Slovyansk is high on Russian President Vladimir Putin's uncompromising list of terms for a ceasefire. A big part of the price he is demanding is for Ukraine to give up the 20% or so of Donetsk it still controls, along with other land that his army has been unable to capture, in the southern regions of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. According to Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Americans have pushed him to take the deal, to get to a ceasefire by the summer.US President Donald Trump also wants Zelensky to call an election, a demand he has not directed at Putin. The evidence suggests that Trump wants to be able to declare he has ended the war. Even if a ceasefire didn't last, he would treat it as a victory he will take into the US mid-term elections next autumn. He is also eyeing huge business deals with Russia, which cannot happen until sanctions are lifted.The Americans have tried to impose deadlines for a deal. Most recently they told Zelensky he needed to agree to a ceasefire by the summer that Donald Trump could concentrate on the mid-terms. The US inability to bend Ukraine – or Russia – to its will shows that its leverage has limits. Four years after Russia's full scale invasion, there is no discernible evidence that a genuine ceasefire is coming .The dangers in DonetskWhen I saw President Zelensky this weekend in Kyiv, he told me that he could never give up land that Russia has not been able to capture. He would never, he said, abandon the people there, and even if he was tempted to do so it would not work, as within two years by his reckoning, the Russian military would be ready and reequipped and Putin would order them to attack again.The first person we visited in Slovyansk was Oleh Tkachenko, a beefy middle-aged pastor who has built up a remarkable relief operation. He is one of the few people outside the military who travel to the most dangerous areas, delivering bread to outlying villages that he makes in his own bakery, which produces 17,000 loaves per week.After his deliveries he often returns with residents who have had enough of living near the front line. Oleh's bakery is an oasis of order and warmth in the freezing, snow-covered ruins of an industrial area on the edge of Slovyansk.The UN World Food Programme helped him re-establish it when he was forced out of his hometown, which is now occupied. He told me that the dangers in Donetsk have multiplied in the last few months as the drone war has intensified.\"The situation has changed radically. There are only very dangerous places and relatively dangerous places. Nowhere is safe in the Donetsk region anymore.\"I asked him whether Zelensky should give in to Russian and American pressure to sacrifice Donetsk for a ceasefire. It was the same question I put to everyone I met in Slovyansk, and it produced the same kind of answer.\"What more does Putin want? This is my Donetsk region. I was born here. My children were born here. I created my family here. And I should leave all that? What for?\"Putin, he said, should not be allowed to take and keep territory that does not belong to Russia.\"We are destroying the values on which this world is built on one person's whim. Not only will the villain avoid punishment, he [will] also be rewarded? I'm sorry. How many villains like this are there in the world?\"AFP via Getty ImagesZelensky said he could never give up land that Russia has not been able to captureAt a coffee bar I met Oleksii Yukov. He runs an organisation called Advis Platsdarm that collects the bodies of dead soldiers from where they were killed, to honour their memory, and before they get a decent burial, identify them to give their families some certainty about them. Oleksii makes no distinctions between dead Russians and dead Ukrainians, but that does not mean he is also prepared to accept Russian domination in Donetsk. Like Oleh, he does not believe promises made by Putin.\"So if a maniac comes to your home and says, \"Give me your daughter and I won't come back,\" do you really think that a man like this – who rapes and pillages - is simply going to stop?\"\"We all know who the maniacs are, right? It's horrifying. To give away a part of yourself – or your child – to be torn apart… I don't understand why this question is even asked of Ukrainians.\"Oleksii has also recovered the remains of soldiers killed in World War Two in the Donbas, the name used for Donetsk and its neighbouring region, Luhansk, which has fallen to Russia in its entirety. He compares Putin's promises to ones made by Adolf Hitler at the Munich conference in 1938. Hitler claimed that a slice of Czechoslovakia known as the Sudetenland was his last territorial demand in Europe. Britain and France accepted his word as the price of avoiding the World War that started the following year. Like many people in this part of Europe, Oleksii sees parallels with the past.\"Promises made by Russia are worth nothing – just like Hitler's promises that once he took the Sudetenland nothing else would happen. We all saw what that led to: the Second World War. Now it could lead to a Third World War if we do not stop and tell Putin that people live here – people who want to live in their own country, on their own land. Each of them has that right. No Ukrainian has the right to say we can give anything away.\"Oleksii believes that forcing Ukraine to give up Donetsk without a fight would be as much of a betrayal as Czechoslovakia suffered at Munich.Along with its embattled neighbour Kramatorsk, Slovyansk is designated as a \"fortress city\". Both are protected by miles of deep anti-tank ditches filled with razor wire and concrete anti-tank obstacles known as \"dragon's teeth\". The towns sit on a range of hills that is the last high ground before around 150 miles of flat land, mostly fields, that stretch right up to the next natural obstacle, the mighty Dnieper River that bisects Ukraine from north to south. Ukrainians argue that stopping the Russians if they reached the flatlands would be much harder.The BeginningFour years ago, almost to the day, I was at the main railway station in Kyiv, watching a scene straight out of Europe's dark past play out in a bitter wind off the Ukrainian steppe. Kyiv was in the depths of a frigid winter so monochrome that the scene on the platform could have been an old newsreel, but it was 2022 and happening in a technicolour, digital age. It was the loudest warning yet that the world had changed, that old assumptions about European security and the safety of the future had to be forgotten.Since then, other warnings have sounded, in the Middle East, in Sudan and in Taiwan, while the war in Ukraine has incubated the biggest crisis in the North Atlantic alliance since it was created in 1949. The gap remains wide between Trump's openness to Putin and the much harsher view of Moscow held by most European members of Nato.Getty ImagesZelensky said earlier this month that 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the last four yearsIn that first week of the war, the platforms at Kyiv station were packed, mostly with Ukrainian women and children, desperate to board trains going west to escape the advancing Russian army. Russian artillery and answering salvoes from the Ukrainians echoed around the empty streets of the city centre, making the threat to the city frighteningly real. Trains pulled in every 15 or 20 minutes, as many as the endlessly enterprising operators of Ukraine's railway network could find in the sidings and marshalling yards. Frightened people jostled their way on, leaving tearful goodbyes on the platform with those staying to fight. At the height of the evacuation 50,000 people a day were passing through the station.In the station concourse a young soldier with a Kalashnikov slung across his back was hugging his girlfriend before she left to go west and he went back to his unit. They could have been a Norman Rockwell cover for the Saturday Evening Post, the magazine that cheered on Americans after they entered World War Two.Zelensky showed immediately that he was an instinctive war leader, a born communicator who was able to rally his people. On the first dark night of the war, dismissing rumours that he had fled, he appeared in olive green military attire, recording a video selfie in front of the presidency building in Kyiv, with his closest advisors behind him.\"We are all here, our soldiers are here, the citizens of the country are here. We are all here protecting our independence, our country and we are going to continue to do so.\"Getty ImagesUkraine and Russia have been fighting since 2014 when President Putin ordered the occupation and annexation of Crimea on the Black SeaThe first months of Russia's full-scale invasion went by for Ukrainians in waves of fear, determination, grief, and patriotic fervour. Some of the Russian soldiers in towns they had occupied around Kyiv carried out massacres – leaving the bodies sprawled where they had been killed on the highway, on the streets of Bucha and in shallow graves. We saw the bodies after Ukraine forced the Russians to retreat from the capital, a victory that confounded the prediction of their western allies that they would be beaten in a few weeks.Ukraine's unexpected strength persuaded the then US President Joe Biden and other European leaders to send more powerful weapons to Kyiv, though never as many or as fast as the Ukrainians wanted. Ukrainians who stayed were volunteering to fight. Those who couldn't set up workshops that churned out Molotov cocktails and camouflage netting.Four years on that energy has dissipated. That should not be surprising. War is all-consuming, and exhausting.It has been replaced by a grim determination to carry on, especially among front line soldiers and their families. Zelensky said earlier this month that 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the last four years, accepting that many more were classified as missing. The real figure is likely to be much higher than 55,000. The chances are that their remains are somewhere along the 800-mile front line.Recruiting new soldiers to replace them in the terrible danger of the deadly and expanding kill zone on the front lines is a struggle. In the cities and at checkpoints men of military age face snap inspections of their papers. If they are eligible for conscription, and do not have an exemption from service, they can be driven off to the barracks on the spot.Getting enough soldiers to fight on is one of Ukraine's greatest challenges, yet polls show substantial majorities here believe that Ukraine can fight on, despite Russian advances on the battlefield, and has no choice as they believe Russia wants to destroy them as a nation. A majority also do not believe that the US-brokered talks will produce a lasting peace. But even though a majority believe Ukraine does not have a choice about fighting on, putting on a uniform and heading for the front line is not a popular choice.Global Images Ukraine via Getty ImagesIn Kyiv, civilians are being killed in their own homes by Russian drones and ballistic missilesValeriy Puzik, an author and poet, volunteered to fight and has spent months at the front line. I met him in a trendy bar in Kyiv, a world away from the six metre deep dug out he inhabited with his squad at the front line for more than 100 days. I asked him why it was so hard to recruit.\"Because when a person leaves a position, they don't say anything positive. And word of mouth does the worst damage. Because, there is nothing positive there. I wouldn't wish any of my friends to crawl into a burrow and sit there… I was lucky to survive. Usually, people sit in those burrows for 90, 100, 160 days. We were basically supposed to stay there until spring.\"Valeriy survived his latest deployment to the front because he volunteered to evacuate two wounded comrades.Before he could be sent back, his old position was attacked and the men who stayed behind, he says, were killed or are missing. Evacuating the wounded men, he believes, saved his life.\"If it weren't for those injuries, most likely we all would have died there.\"The Long WarUkraine and Russia have been fighting since 2014 when President Putin ordered the occupation and annexation of Crimea on the Black Sea and then seized parts of the Donbas in the east.On this current trip, I have seen no evidence that the war is going to end soon.The full-scale invasion four years ago was Putin's attempt to eliminate the independence of Ukraine once and for all. He has said many times that history shows Ukraine belongs with Russia. A few days before the anniversary of the invasion President Zelensky dismissed that succinctly in a post on X: \"I don't need historical shit to end this war and move to diplomacy. Because it's just a delay tactic. I read no less history books than Putin. And I learned a lot.\"Zelensky has weathered a corruption scandal that forced the resignation last autumn of his chief of staff, Andrii Yermak. He has trenchant critics, and potential rivals, but still has approval ratings of which most western leaders can only dream.Gwara Media/Global Images Ukraine via Getty ImagesThe Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022This week, far to the east of Kyiv, the trains that evacuated hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians in February and March 2022 are still taking people out of harm's way. The Russia military moves at a glacial pace, but in the key battleground of Donetsk in the east it is grinding forward, chewing up lives, the landscape, and whole villages and towns. Ukraine still holds around a fifth of Donetsk oblast, or region. It is the most intensely fought-over part of Ukraine.One after another, a series of battles over four years have turned towns and villages into rubble, from Bakhmut earlier in the war to Pokrovsk now.Every day buses cross the regional border from Donetsk to Lozova in the Kharkiv oblast, carrying civilian evacuees. A school has been turned into a warm and clean relief coordination centre – packed with families surrounded with a few bags of possessions, dogs on leads, cats in baskets and most of all tormented by loss. Serhii and Viktoria had arrived from Druzhkivka, a town that has been sucked into the kill zone. Their teenage daughter Diana sat silently next to them, with her cat Mika on her lap. Like millions of others displaced by war, here and in other turbulent stretches of the world, they were leaving to save themselves, knowing too well that also meant not just losing the remains of their old lives, but also personal independence. Now they had to sit and wait while the paperwork was done and someone else told them what to do. Viktoria explained why they had left their home.\"We are on the brink. We didn't have any gas, water or power. No heating. We were staying there till the very last moment, freezing for three days.\"Back at the end of 2022, their town, Druzhkivka, was seen as a relatively safe haven when we used it as a base to report the Russian attack on Bakhmut. But no one goes there now, Viktoria says. Druzhkivka is too dangerous.\"The drones destroy everything alive – the cars, the people, their homes. I can't tell you without tears.\"Serhii looked prematurely old.\"It is very difficult. We have abandoned everything we worked for our whole lives. Everything we worked for, for our families, all we were building. And we had to abandon all that in one moment…everything… We could only pack some small things. We could not have taken more.\"Standing near them was Tamara, with her nine-year-old twin granddaughters, Mila and Tina.\"The kids. We left because of the kids. We live near the forest… There are lots of tanks… drones are flying everywhere… there is no peace …the children are running to me and crying… it is very loud…. Everything is shaking…\"Lviv in western Ukraine, where families were send to from Lozova Once they were registered, the families with their bags and their pets were bused to Lozova station, to board a long train heading for Lviv in western Ukraine. Lozova used to be a busy junction for trains heading further east. Now it is now the last stop for Ukrainian railways. The lines beyond it are too dangerous.A defiant UkraineThe talks brokered by Trump's envoys, the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner and his friend, the real estate billionaire, Steve Witkoff, continue. They are expected to convene again in Geneva after the anniversary of the invasion. Witkoff made positive noises after the last round but both Russia and Ukraine talked about a difficult atmosphere.It is hard to see any kind of ceasefire emerging unless either Putin or Zelensky change their fundamental positions. Since both sides believe they can fight on to some kind of victory that is not likely to change.The negotiations appear more of an exercise in placating Trump, so that he cannot blame either Moscow or Kyiv for their failure. The US president tends to default back to putting pressure on Ukraine. In the past he has claimed, untruthfully, that Zelensky is a dictator who started the war. Zelensky laughed and said it wasn't true when I asked him about it. On the eve of the last round, just before the anniversary Trump told journalists that \"Ukraine better come to the table, fast\".AFP via Getty ImagesPresident Zelensky said if Ukraine is to fight on, it will need increasing levels of European supportTrump has ended almost all military aid, but Ukraine still depends on intelligence only the US can provide. Europe buys US weapons, especially interceptor missiles from the Americans on behalf of Ukraine.On this trip to Ukraine I have found a country that remains defiant. It does not feel close to defeat.The big cities function well, despite Russia's concerted and effective attacks throughout this bitterly cold winter on its power and heating grid. In Kyiv, there are traffic jams, well-stocked shops, restaurants and cafés. There are also air-raid sirens, often in the small hours of the morning, and terrible stories of civilians being killed in their own homes by Russian drones and ballistic missiles. Ukraine is rebuilding the military-industrial complex that existed here in Soviet times, concentrating on long range strikes on Russia.Russia has made concerted and effective attacks on Ukraine's power and heating gridPresident Zelensky told me they can win the war, and if Ukraine is to fight on, it will need increasing levels of European support.Spring is in sight, but in this part of Europe winter can drag on into April. Russia has put immense pressure on Ukraine throughout the coldest winter in years by targeting power stations and Soviet-era plants that provide districts with hot water and heat.In the ruins of a power station that the Ukrainians allowed us to visit on condition we did not identify it, workers were salvaging steel from the wreckage. The plant had been hammered by Russian missiles and drones. Repairs were out of the question. It needed to be rebuilt. With his breath condensing in clouds in temperatures double figures below zero, a foreman summed the attitude that is common here, when I asked him why Russia was attacking them.\"They want to make us kneel. They want to bring Ukraine to its knees.\"That is a fact, and Ukraine's determination to stop it happening is why this war continues.More from InDepthTop picture credit: Global Images Ukraine via Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "18 hours agoMalu CursinoGetty ImagesCelebrity doctor Peter Attia has stepped down from his role as a CBS News contributor after exchanges with Jeffrey Epstein were among documents published by the US Department of Justice.Attia appears to have exchanged a number of emails with the convicted sex offender, including a crass comment about women's bodies.Attia's spokesman said in a statement his role at CBS News \"was newly established and had not yet meaningfully begun\" and he would be step back to avoid becoming \"a distraction from the important work being done at CBS\".The anti-ageing influencer has repeatedly apologised for the messages but stressed he had no involvement in Epstein's criminality.Appearing in the files does not imply any wrongdoing.Attia was among 19 contributors appointed by new CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss in January, following the network's takeover by Paramount.But Attia's appearance in the Epstein files has been met with anger by some of his fans.The author wrote that he went into Epstein \"withdrawal when I don't see him\" and told the disgraced financier directly in one exchange that he missed him.In one email in 2016, Attia also joked with Epstein about the female anatomy and acts of sex.Epstein was convicted of soliciting a minor in 2008 as part of a plea deal after the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police that he had molested their daughter. He died in custody in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges including sex trafficking.Days after the documents were published, Attia shared a 1,000-word note on social media in which he rejected being \"involved in any criminal activity\" and stressed that he was \"never on his [Epstein's] plane, never on his island, and never present at any sex parties\".\"My interactions with Epstein had nothing to do with his sexual abuse or exploitation of anyone.\"The health influencer said he visited Epstein at the late financier's New York City home on \"seven or eight\" occasions between 2014 and 2019, during which he never witnessed illegal activity or saw Epstein accompanied by anyone who appeared to be underage.Attia was among contributors Weiss brought in at CBS to share their expertise on a range of topics, from health to national security.Weiss, a former New York Times opinion writer, was appointed to her new role as part of a bid by the broadcaster's new owner to reshape it.Weiss, who started her career working at Jewish news outlets, is known for her criticism of \"cancel culture\".CBS was taken over by David Ellison, the son of Trump ally and tech billionaire Larry Ellison, in 2025 as part of a wider merger with Paramount. CBS News has a partnership agreement with the BBC, meaning news content including video footage can be shared. BBC News is editorially independent of CBS.",

    "body": "17 hours agoJamie WhiteheadBBC News ReutersHong Kong has formally complained to the government of Panama after it took control of two ports on the Panama Canal. It accused the Panamanian authorities of taking them over by force.The ports had been run by a Hong Kong-based company, CK Hutchison, for more than two decades.Last month, Panama's Supreme Court annulled the contracts which allowed the firm to operate the container ports, saying they were \"unconstitutional\".The ruling followed claims by US President Donald Trump that China was operating the canal. There is no public evidence to suggest this.Hong Kong's government said, in a statement, it was lodging a \"strong protest\" after Panama's \"blatant act\" undermined both the \"spirit of the contracts\" and  \"international trade rules\". Last year, the Hong Kong-based company agreed to sell most of its stake in the two ports to a group led by the US investment firm BlackRock. The move by the Panamanian government could disrupt the $22.8bn (£20.75bn) sale, according to the Reuters news agency.President Trump has repeatedly claimed that the Central American canal is under Chinese control.During his inauguration address last January, he said: \"China is operating the Panama Canal and we didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we're taking it back.\"The following month, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also demanded that Panama make \"immediate changes\" to what he called the \"influence and control\" of China over the canal.There is no public evidence to suggest China exercises control over the canal, though Chinese companies have a significant presence there.Up to 14,000 ships use the 51-mile (82km) Panama Canal each year as a shortcut between the Atlantic and Pacific.The waterway, which handles about 5% of global maritime trade volume, is operated by the Panama Canal Authority, an agency of the Panamanian government.From October 2023 to September 2024, China accounted for 21.4% of the cargo volume transiting the canal, making it the second-largest user after the US.",

    "body": "2 days agoPhanindra Dahal,BBC Nepali, in Kathmandu,andHafsa KhalilEPAA 24-year-old British man is among 19 people who were killed in a bus crash in Nepal, police say.The bus - which had been carrying tourists - had been travelling to the capital, Kathmandu, when it lost control and fell 200m on to the bank of the Trishuli river, in the country's central Dhading district, in the early hours of Monday morning.There were 44 people onboard including the driver, 25 of whom suffered injuries. The bus had been travelling from Pokhara, a popular tourist spot.Nepal's Home Ministry has created a five-member taskforce to investigate the cause of the incident. The UK Foreign Office said it was assisting the family of the Briton who was killed.Nepalese authorities identified him as Stewart Dominic Ethan. His name has not been confirmed by the Foreign Office.Nepalese police say they have identified all 19 bodies, including a 40-year-old Chinese woman and a 32-year-old man from India. Among the injured is a Chinese national and a New Zealander.All the injured had been taken to hospitals in the capital, they added. Children were among those onboard.Multiple teams were sent to the site, including police units, the army and a rescue team of divers, authorities said.Police spokesman Abinarayan Kafle said 17 people died at the scene, with two more dying while receiving treatment, BBC Nepali reported.Road accidents are relatively commonplace in Nepal, due to a range of factors including poor road maintenance and narrow paths in mountainous areas.In 2024, at least 14 people died after a bus travelling from Pokhara to Kathmandu fell into the Marsyangdi river in the Tanahun district.\"We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Nepal and are in contact with the local authorities,\" a Foreign Office spokesman told the BBC.Nepal is a popular destination for many international visitors, especially climbers, who travel there to access a key section of the Himalaya mountain range that includes Mount Everest.",

    "body": "2 hours agoKelly NgandShaimaa Khalil,Tokyo correspondentGetty ImagesYonaguni is visible from Taiwan's shores on a clear dayJapan plans to deploy surface-to-air missiles to its remote western island near Taiwan by March 2031, its defence minister said, as regional tensions simmer.It is the first time that Japan specified a timeline for the missile deployment to Yonaguni island since it was announced in 2022.China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own and has not ruled out the use of force to \"reunify\" with it. Yonaguni is visible from Taiwan's shores on a clear day, located just 110km (68 miles) away.Tensions between Tokyo and Beijing have run high since November when Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi appeared to suggest that Japan would activate its self-defence force in the event of an attack on Taiwan.The worry has long been that any attack on Taiwan, which counts the US as an ally, could result in a direct military conflict between Washington and Beijing, then widen to include other US allies in the region such as Japan.Takaichi's remarks to parliament plunged ties with China to their lowest level in years and Beijing has been piling on the pressure in a wide range of ways - sending warships, throttling rare earth exports, curbing Chinese tourism, cancelling concerts and even reclaiming its pandas.Japanese defence minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced the timeline for the missiles on Tuesday, a day after China imposed export curbs on 20 Japanese companies and entities, citing national security concerns.Koizumi said the Yonaguni unit will be equipped with medium-range surface-to-air missiles able to intercept incoming aircraft and missiles.China has yet to react to Koizumi's announcement. But when Koizumi visited Yonaguni in November, Beijing said Japan was moving to \"create regional tension and provoke military confrontation\".Within days, it flew drones near the island to express its anger, prompting Japan to scramble aircraft jets in response.The latest developments come after Takaichi, a conservative China hawk, secured a landslide victory in parliamentary elections earlier this month.That victory gave Takaichi political space to double down on boosting Japan's defence capabilities.It makes the announcement on Yonaguni island more than just a military adjustment. It looks like the opening chapter of a more assertive Tokyo — and that it is unlikely to end here.It shows where Japan sees its front line and how far it is prepared to go to defend it.Over the past decade, Japan has transformed sleepy Yonaguni into a military outpost. It currently handles coastal surveillance and is staffed by some 160 members of Japan's self-defence force. An electronic warfare unit capable of disrupting enemy communications and radar will be set up in fiscal year 2026, which runs from April to March next year. The timing for the deployment of the missile unit \"may change depending on the progress of future facility improvements, but the current plan is for fiscal year 2030\", Koizumi said.",

It's really hard to face this reality about an old friend.\"Born on 24 March 1954, Carradine was the youngest son of John Carradine and a brother of actors David and Keith Carradine.Encouraged by his brother David, Robert Carradine auditioned for 1972's The Cowboys, a John Wayne film that became his first screen role. He went on to appear in and Martin Scorsese's 1973 film Mean Streets, Oscar-winning Coming Home (1978), alongside Jane Fonda, The Long Riders (1980), with Mark Hamill, The Big Red One (1980) and Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained in 2012.AlamyCarradine (second right) played Hilary Duff's father in the early-2000s Disney Channel series Lizzie McGuireBut he was best known for playing the head nerd, Lewis Skolnick, in Revenge of the Nerds - which became one of the most popular film franchises of the 1980s, and the father of Lizzie McGuire in the noughties Disney Channel series.Paying tribute, Lizzie McGuire star Duff said: \"There was so much warmth in the McGuire family and I always felt so cared for by my on-screen parents. \"I'll be forever grateful for that. I'm deeply sad to learn Bobby was suffering. My heart aches for him, his family, and everyone who loved him.\"In a statement, Carradine's family announced his death \"with profound sadness\", adding that the US actor was a \"beloved father, grandfather, uncle, and brother\".\"In a world that can feel so dark, Bobby was always a beacon on light to everyone around him,\" they said.\"We are bereft at the loss of this beautiful soul and want to acknowledge Bobby's valiant struggle against his nearly two-decade battle with bipolar disorder. \"We hope his journey can shine a light and encourage addressing the stigma that attaches to mental illness.\"The statement added: \"At this time we ask for the privacy to grieve this unfathomable loss. With gratitude for your understanding and compassion.\"In his own separate statement to Deadline, Carradine's brother Keith added: \"It is an illness that got the best of him, and I want to celebrate him for his struggle with it, and celebrate his beautiful soul. \"He was profoundly gifted, and we will miss him every day. We will take solace in how funny he could be, how wise and utterly accepting and tolerant he was. That's who my baby brother was.\"",

    "body": "Landmark royal commission into antisemitism prompted by Bondi shooting begins23 hours agoLana LamSydneyGetty ImagesThe federal royal commission will look at antisemitism and its drivers in AustraliaAustralia's royal commission into antisemitism, prompted after the Bondi Beach shootings that killed 15 people and injured 40, has begun public hearings.The federal commission - the country's most powerful form of public inquiry - will investigate the prevalence and key drivers of antisemitism and make recommendations to government.Headed by former High Court Justice Virginia Bell, the inquiry - which started on Tuesday - will also examine the events leading up to the attack, which was Australia's worst mass shooting in decades.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had resisted calls for a federal inquiry, saying it would hinder social cohesion but later bowed to public pressure.The commissioner is expected to hand down an interim report by the end of April, and a full report no later than the first anniversary of the attack, which took place on 14 December last year.\"I acknowledge that for some, it will never be right to speak of closure, but one small part of coming to terms with the events of that evening will be the work of this commission,\" Bell said in her opening address on Tuesday.\"I regard the delivery of my report on or before the first anniversary as a matter of critical importance,\" she added.Bell said she was \"interested in hearing from Jewish Australians who've experienced antisemitism whether at school or at university, or in the workplace or elsewhere\".Any person could make a submission online, and no one would be pressured into giving evidence in public, she said.Richard Lancaster, senior counsel assisting the commission, described the Bondi shooting as a \"truly horrifying event\" and acknowledged the \"immense trauma\" the attack had caused Jewish Australians.Lancaster proposed to lead evidence on four broad topics: identifying antisemitic conduct, identifying the drivers of antisemitism, examining how law enforcement tackles antisemitism and inquiring into the circumstances of the Bondi shooting - particularly the dealings security agencies and intelligence services had with the alleged gunmen.Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead by police at the scene of the shootings. His son Naveed Akram - the other alleged attacker - was critically injured and later transferred from hospital to prison.The 24-year-old appeared in court last week for the first time, facing 59 charges, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist attack.In light of the ongoing criminal case, the royal commission has been instructed to avoid matters that might prejudice current and future court proceedings. This may mean some hearings are conducted behind closed doors. In the immediate aftermath of the shootings, Albanese announced a review by a former spy chief to look at what federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies did in the lead-up to the attack and what improvements could be made.He said that review, alongside a royal commission called by the state of New South Wales, would be the best way to respond to the attacks and that a federal inquiry would give a platform to antisemitic hate speech.However Albanese was forced to reverse his decision amid continued calls by prominent Jewish leaders and a number of the families affected - which were echoed by the opposition leader at the time.As a result, the review into federal law enforcement and agencies will be folded into the royal commission and the NSW inquiry was cancelled.The shootings also prompted a raft of new gun laws and crackdown on hate speech, as well as greater powers to limit protests.The commission comes amid an already fraught debate raging in Australia over Israel, Gaza and antisemitism.Earlier this month, a rally against a visit by Israeli president Isaac Herzog was marred by violent scuffles between police and protestors. Herzog had been invited by Albanese as a comfort to the families affected by the Bondi attack, but his visit was opposed by thousands of Australians over his government's actions in Gaza.",

    "body": "Probe under way after illness kills 72 tigers in Thai tourist park21 hours agoKoh EweAnadolu Agency via Getty ImagesAt Tiger Kingdom Chiang Mai, visitors can touch and interact with tigersAuthorities in Chiang Mai, a city in northern Thailand, are investigating the deaths of dozens of tigers at a popular tourist attraction.Seventy-two tigers died in the span of less than two weeks this month, across two facilities of Tiger Kingdom Chiang Mai, a park where visitors can touch and interact with the big cats.The local livestock department said samples from the tigers showed canine distemper virus - though authorities have not confirmed how the outbreak happened.Officials told a news conference on Tuesday the virus was no longer spreading and no more tigers were dying. No humans had been infected, they added.The remains of the tigers have all been buried and a recommendation was made for the gravely ill tigers be euthanised, authorities said.The big cats were among more than 240 tigers living across the two facilities at Tiger Kingdom Chiang Mai, according to local media.Canine distemper virus is a highly contagious disease that attacks the host's respiratory, gastrointestinal and nervous systems. While it is typically found among dogs, it can also infect big cats.Besides canine distemper virus, the provincial livestock office in Chiang Mai said last week that samples from the tigers' carcasses also tested positive for a bacteria associated with respiratory disease.\"By the time we realised they were sick, it was already too late,\" Somchuan Ratanamungklanon, director of the national livestock department, previously told local media - noting that it was harder to detect sickness in tigers compared to animals like common household cats or dogs.Somchuan told reporters on Tuesday that officials had collected samples from the tigers' bodies, the chicken they eat and their surroundings.The provincial livestock office had earlier said preliminary tests showed the tigers had been infected with feline parvovirus. Some local officials had also initially suspected the outbreak might have stemmed from contaminated raw chicken meat fed to the tigers, the Bangkok Post reported.Raw chicken was also suspected as the cause of a major bird flu outbreak at a tiger zoo in Chonburi province in 2004. In that case, nearly 150 tigers died or were euthanised to prevent further spread of the influenza.The disease control department said over the weekend that, while none of the veterinarians or other staff working in the Chiang Mai tiger enclosures had fallen ill from canine distemper virus, they had been placed under observation for 21 days, Thai PBS reported.Animal rights groups say this case highlights the poor living conditions of captive tigers used for entertainment in Thailand. Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand said in a statement that the tigers' deaths exposed the \"extreme vulnerability of captive wildlife facilities to infectious disease\".\"Tragedies like this would be far less likely to happen\" if tourists \"stayed away\" from these attractions, Peta Asia said in a statement.Tiger Kingdom Chiang Mai has been temporarily closed for two weeks as officials carry out disinfection work.",

    "body": "14 hours agoOttilie MitchellandHafsa KhalilBloomberg via Getty ImagesSavyolovsky Station pictured in 2018An explosion outside a major train station in Moscow that killed a traffic police officer and injured two others was a suicide attack, Russian officials say.Russia's Interior Ministry said the officers had been patrolling at Savyolovsky Station Square, north of the city centre, when \"an unidentified device was detonated\" in the early hours of Tuesday.The Russian Investigative Committee identified the suspect as a 22-year-old man from the country's Udmurt republic, adding that an investigation was under way.A motive has not yet been established. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the suspect was apparently recruited online.Putin told a meeting of Russia's domestic spy agency that terror attacks had been increasing, mostly at the hands of Ukrainian intelligence.However, attacks attributed to Ukraine in Russia have typically not involved suicide bombings.Putin claimed the suspect in the attack, which occurred just after midnight local time (21:05 GMT on Monday), had been blown up remotely.Russian Investigative Committee spokeswoman Svetlana Petrenko said the attacker - who she said was a Russian native - had travelled from St Petersburg to Moscow by train on Sunday.She said the committee was now looking into a motive for the attack and whether he had any accomplices.The perpetrator and the police officer both died at the scene, Petrenko added.Officials have given no additional information regarding the explosive device so far.The attacker approached officers from the north-eastern district of Moscow, the Interior Ministry said in a statement.A criminal case has been opened against the perpetrator for the attempt on the life of a law enforcement officer and charges relating to the explosive device. Law enforcement agencies were working in tandem to \"establish all the circumstances\", the ministry added.The two injured officers were taken to hospital \"with various injuries\" following the explosion.Medical sources told news agency Tass the officers were in a serious condition.The ministry identified the officer who was killed as 34-year-old Police Lieutenant Denis Bratuschenko, a senior inspector in the traffic police. He had joined the force in 2019 and is survived by his wife and two children, it said.\"The leadership and personnel of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia express their sincere condolences to the family,\" a statement from Irina Volk, the ministry's spokeswoman, read.This is not the first time traffic police have been killed in an explosion in the Russian capital.",

    "body": "2 days agoKhanyisile NgcoboJohannesburgReutersBellarmine Mugabe is due to reappear in court next week for a bail hearingThe youngest son of Zimbabwe's late former President Robert Mugabe has been formally charged with attempted murder at a brief appearance in a South African court.Bellarmine Mugabe, 28, was arrested last week after a 23-year-old man was shot and injured at a property in an upmarket suburb of Johannesburg last Thursday. He was then taken into custody alongside his bodyguard - neither man has commented on the charges.Appearing in court, dressed in black, Mugabe looked calm during the proceedings.Bellarmine is the youngest son of Robert and his second wife Grace Mugabe. Robert Mugabe, who died in 2019, led Zimbabwe for 37 years before being forced out of power at the age of 93 in 2017.Searching the property in Hyde Park where the shooting happened, police have found bullet cartridges but no firearm so far.Mugabe and Tobias Tamirepi Matonhodze, 33, also face additional charges, including defeating the ends of justice, which relates to the missing firearm, prosecutors say.The victim is in hospital and in a critical condition.Speaking outside court, Mugabe's lawyer Sinenhlanhla Mnguni provided an update on his well-being, telling reporters his client was \"fine\" as he remains in custody. Describing the circumstances of the shooting, prosecutors allege that \"an altercation occurred between the victim and the accused inside Mugabe's home\".While attempting to flee the victim was then allegedly \"shot in the back and collapsed outside the gate\" and the gate was then closed, according to a statement from the National Prosecuting Authority.The case against Mugabe and Matonhodze was postponed until 3 March when a bail application will be made.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "14 hours agoBrandon DrenonSavannah Guthrie offers $1m reward for information on missing motherUS news anchor Savannah Guthrie has announced her family is offering a $1m reward for information leading to the return of her mother on day 24 of the search for the 84-year-old.Fighting back tears, the NBC host said in an Instagram video that they are \"aching\" for Nancy Guthrie, who is suspected to have been abducted from her home in Tucson, Arizona.\"We still believe in a miracle, we still believe that she can come home - hope against hope,\" said the presenter.\"We also know that she may be lost, she may already be gone, she may have already gone home to the Lord that she loves.\"In the video released on Tuesday morning, Savannah Guthrie said her family would also donate $500,000 to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.She continued: \"Please, if you hear this message, if you've been waiting and you haven't been sure, let this be your sign to please come forward. \"Tell what you know, and help us bring our beloved mom home, so that we can either celebrate a glorious, miraculous homecoming or celebrate the beautiful, brave and courageous and noble life that she has lived.\"ReutersIn a post on X, the FBI's Phoenix office said anyone with \"firsthand knowledge\" of Guthrie's whereabouts should contact the FBI tip line at 1-800-CALL-FBI.Until now, the reward has been $200,000 - $100,000 offered by the FBI and another $100,000 through Tucson Crime Stoppers.Guthrie was reported missing around midday on 1 February after she did not show up for church services.The Pima County Sheriff's Office has said they believe she was \"taken from the home against her will, possibly in the middle of the night and that includes possible kidnapping or abduction\".The family has made several public pleas for her safe return, and asked for proof that she is alive. Nancy Guthrie has difficulty walking, has a pacemaker and needs daily medication for a heart condition, authorities have said.Investigators have released images of the prime suspect - a man captured on Nancy Guthrie's Nest doorbell camera. Watch: New video shows masked person outside Nancy Guthrie's homeThis same suspect appears to have been at Nancy Guthrie's front door on another occasion before she went missing, a law enforcement source told the BBC's US partner CBS.Purported ransom notes demanding about $6m in cryptocurrency have been sent to media outlets, including one note whose deadline expired on 9 February. At least one note was a fake, allegedly sent by a 42-year-old California man, who has been charged. Massive interest in the case has turned Tuscon - a relatively quiet city popular with retirees - into a global media hub. Dozens of curious observers and amateur sleuths have descended on the area. Detectives have received close to 40,000 tips from the public.DNA evidence was recovered from a glove - similar to one worn by the suspect recorded on doorbell camera footage  - that was found not far from her home, but it yielded no matches in a FBI database, authorities said.Investigators have ruled out all members of the Guthrie family as possible suspects, with Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos previously saying that to \"suggest otherwise is not only wrong, it is cruel\".",

    "body": "7 hours agoSofia Ferreira SantosandIone Wells,South America correspondent, São PauloBruno Stephan/Prefeitura de Juiz de Fora/Handout via ReutersRescue operations are ongoing to locate missing residentsAt least 25 people have died in the south-eastern Brazilian state of Minas Gerais after heavy rains on Monday evening caused floods and several landslides.Most deaths were reported in the city of Juiz de Fora, where officials say 18 people were killed, while another seven deaths were reported in Ubá.Rescue operations are ongoing, with workers and residents searching for dozens of people reported missing after several homes and buildings collapsed overnight.Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva sent his \"deepest condolences\" to the families of the victims and those who lost their homes. He also said that the government had declared a \"state of calamity\" in Juiz de Fora.In a post on X, Lula said he had mobilised the wider government to support those in the region and said his focus was on providing humanitarian assistance and supporting reconstruction efforts.He added that the government would act with the \"speed and force this moment requires\".Around 440 people have been left homeless or displaced in Juiz de Fora alone, with the local government providing temporary shelter and asking for donations of water, food, clothing and hygiene supplies.Mayor Margarida Salomão said the tragedy was the \"saddest\" moment in her five years in local government and declared three days of official mourning in memory of all the people in Juiz de Fora who lost their lives.She said children were among those who died in Juiz de Fora, but the city has so far not released any further official information on the victims' identities.Valtencir Coutinho de Miranda made a plea on live television as he searched for his six-year-old daughter who is among those missing.Holding a shovel in his hand among the mud and debris left by a landslide, he told TV Globo: \"We are here to find her, with God giving us strength and comforting our hearts, so that we may find her alive.\"ReutersRescue and clean up efforts are under way in areas hit by landslides A man who helped rescue a four-year-old child and three adults from an area of Juiz de Fora affected by landslides told local media he was still searching for his nephew.\"In that moment you don't choose who you help, you just do your best to help,\" he said in tears.Videos shared on social media showed widespread devastation caused by the rain, with muddy waters carrying vehicles and other debris through the city and several buildings collapsing.A video taken in Ubá showed several caskets being carried by the stream as flooding hit a funeral home in the city.An image shared by local government showed the impact of the heavy rains on a hill above Juiz de Fora, called Morro do Cristo, with waters eroding a deep gorge through the middle of it. UGC/Juiz de Fora City HallMorro do Cristo was damaged by the heavy rainMinas Gerais Governor Romeu Zema said the state was experiencing a \"sad day\" and offered his solidarity to the families affected by the intense downpours. Local officials say this has been the rainiest February in the history of Juiz de Fora, with the current rainfall in the region already more than double the amount expected for the month.On Tuesday, the country's national meteorological institute issued a heavy rain alert for all of Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and 12 other Brazilian states.It is currently summer in Brazil - and peak rainy season, with thunderstorms, flooding and landslides a common sight in the country.In 2024, almost 200 people were killed in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, with heavy rains, flooding and landslides impacting more than two million people.",

    "body": "2 days agoAndré Rhoden-PaulandAnna Holligan,in The HagueGetty ImagesRob Jetten at his swearing-in ceremony with King Willem-AlexanderRob Jetten has become the youngest and first openly gay prime minister of the Netherlands after his minority government was sworn in.The 38-year-old claimed victory in October's election with his Democrats 66 party (D66) narrowly beating anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders in a nail-biting election.Jetten formed a centre-right minority government with the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and the Christian Democratic Alliance (CDA).It is a minority cabinet, meaning every major reform in the coalition deal - from an extra €19bn (£16.6bn) for defence to painful cuts in healthcare and benefits - will have to be negotiated vote by vote in the Netherlands' two parliamentary houses.The coalition also wants fewer asylum seekers, with refugees having to apply for asylum outside Europe, not after they arrive.Asylum migration has been a particularly sensitive issue in Dutch politics, contributing to the downfall of the country's last two coalition governments. D66 will provide seven ministers, VVD will provide six, and CDA five, with three state secretaries each - junior members of cabinet.Jetten was formally sworn in by King Willem-Alexander at the Huis ten Bosch Palace in The Hague on Monday.Posting a selfie ahead of his swearing-in ceremony, Jetten wrote on X: \"Proud to be doing this together. In a new phase, with great responsibility and, above all, a shared promise to work for everyone in the Netherlands.\"By not dwelling on what's wrong, but by building on what can be improved. That requires courage and collaboration.\"EPAPrime Minister Dick Schoof during a handover ceremony with Rob Jetten 'Let's get to work' Slick, smiling and patient, Jetten has spent years shaking off the nickname \"Robot Jetten\", earned for his stiff, over‑rehearsed TV appearances.The transformation was stark on election night. In a packed, sweaty music venue in Leiden (between Amsterdam and The Hague), he seemed effortlessly at ease, confident and groomed, as young supporters roared around him.For many BBC News met there that night, the D66 leader was everything Wilders was not: relatively young, upbeat, pro‑EU and socially liberal - a fresh face pitched against an older, hard‑right establishment.In the Netherlands, Jetten's sexuality barely featured in the campaign, which says something about how mainstream LGBTQ equality has become.But globally, he joins a very small club of openly gay leaders, and for many viewers in countries where coming out carries real risk, seeing an openly gay man become prime minister is a powerful glass‑ceiling moment.Standing beside the King on a red carpet spilling down the palace steps on Monday, Jetten gave the appearance of a well-polished premier.After being confirmed as prime minister, he posted the official photo on Instagram with a brisk caption: \"Let's get to work.\"Wilders, who pulled the plug on his own right-wing coalition in June, has said he would oppose any initiative by Jetten's government, while other parties have raised concerns about the plans presented so far.Jesse Klaver, leader of the GreenLeft-Labour coalition, the biggest alliance in opposition, posted on X on Friday about the government's financial plans: \"Ordinary people will pay hundreds of Euros more, while the very richest won't be asked to pay anything extra.\"That's unfair and won't help the Netherlands move forward. We take responsibility for adjusting these plans. This has to change.\"",

    "body": "16 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterLatin America editor, News OnlineEPAThe prison break happened as a wave of violence rocked Puerto Vallarta and towns and cities in 19 other statesPolice in Mexico are searching a number of inmates sprung from a prison in Puerto Vallarta during a wave of attacks launched by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) on Sunday. Puerto Vallarta, a beach resort on Mexico's Pacific coast, was among the towns where the CJGN blockaded roads and torched cars in retaliation for the killing by security forces of their leader, Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as \"El Mencho\".During the unrest, armed men rammed one of the prison gates with a car, paving the way for 23 prisoners to escape, an official said.More than 70 people – including 25 National Guard members – were killed in the operation to capture El Mencho and the violence which followed.Juan Pablo Hernández, security secretary for the state of Jalisco, said that his office was working with other states to capture the fugitives. Officials have not yet released details of the identities of the prisoners who escaped. Cartel members torched several vehicles across Puerto Vallarta on Sunday.Tourists and locals were urged to seek shelter and not venture out and footage they recorded showed black plumes of smoke rising above the popular beach resort.A number of airlines temporarily halted their flights and at least two major cruise liners said their ships would skip planned stops in Puerto Vallarta.The Mexican government said on Monday that most of the road blocks erected by cartel members had been cleared. But El Universal newspaper reports that in the state of Morelia, where drug lord El Mencho was born, armed men continued to spread fear on Monday, torching cars and vandalising shops and public buildings. BBC's Will Grant on the atmosphere in Mexico following unrestEl Mencho was Mexico's most wanted man. Under his leadership, the CJGN became a powerful transnational criminal organisation which spread from its stronghold in the state of Jalisco into many other Mexican states, where it engages in  drug production and trafficking.It often resorts to extreme violence and has been behind a number of high-profile attacks on the security forces and government officials. The Trump administration had described El Mencho as a \"top target for the Mexican and United States government as one of the top traffickers of fentanyl into our homeland\" and had offered a $15m (£11.1m) reward for information leading to his capture.The drug lord was captured by Mexican security forces in the town of Tapalpa, in Jalisco state, on Sunday.Mexico's defence minister said they were able to locate him by following one of his \"romantic partners\".He died shortly after being captured due to injuries in the firefight which broke out between his security guards and Mexico's special forces sent to arrest him.",

    "body": "2 days agoMaia DaviesGetty ImagesAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor is eighth in line to the throneAustralia's prime minister has told Sir Keir Starmer his government would back plans to remove Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of royal succession.Anthony Albanese expressed his support for such a proposal in a letter to the UK prime minister.Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne despite being stripped of his titles, including \"prince\", in October amid pressure over his ties to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.The UK government is considering introducing legislation to remove him from the line of succession. It follows Andrew's arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office on Thursday. He has consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing.The former prince was released under investigation 11 hours after his arrest by Thames Valley Police.Removing Andrew from the line of succession would require an act of Parliament supported by the 14 Commonwealth countries where King Charles III, his brother, is head of state, including Australia.Albanese's letter reads: \"Dear Prime Minister Starmer, in light of recent events concerning Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, I am writing to confirm that my government would agree to any proposal to remove him from the line of royal succession.\"I agree with His Majesty that the law must now take its full course and there must be a full, fair and proper investigation.\"These are grave allegations and Australians take them seriously.\"Speaking after his brother Andrew's arrest, King Charles had said: \"What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities.\"A spokesman for the UK prime minister confirmed the letter had been received and said the government was \"considering whether further steps are required in relation to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor\". \"Given the ongoing police investigation it would not be appropriate for the government to comment further at this stage,\" the spokesman added.Darren Jones, chief secretary to the prime minister, told MPs on Monday that the government was \"not ruling out action in respect of the line of succession at this stage\". Removing Andrew from the line of succession would require an act of Parliament approved by MPs and peers, and would come into effect when given royal assent by the King.Canada, Jamaica and New Zealand are among the Commonwealth countries who would also need to support it.The last time someone was removed from the line of succession by an act of Parliament was in 1936, when the former Edward VIII and his descendants were removed due to his abdication.Getty ImagesAnthony Albenese wrote to his UK counterpart on MondayBuckingham Palace has not publicly commented on the government's consideration of legislation to remove Andrew from the line of succession.On Friday, Defence Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC that the move - which would prevent Andrew from ever becoming King - was the \"right thing to do,\" regardless of the outcome of the police investigation.Chief Secretary to the Treasury James Murray meanwhile said \"any questions in that sphere would be quite complicated\", adding that the live police investigation needed to \"play out\".Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said on Monday that Parliament should not pass legislation to remove the former prince from the line of succession \"until the police have finished their jobs\". He also cautioned against a \"trial by media\".The former prince was arrested at 08:00 GMT on Thursday at Sandringham, the King's Norfolk estate where Andrew has been living since leaving his Windsor home, Royal Lodge, in early February.Police searches at Sandringham concluded late on Thursday. It is understood they continued at the 30-room property in Windsor over the weekend, where several unmarked police cars were seen on Saturday.Andrew has previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. He has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment on specific allegations that have emerged after the US release of millions of files in January connected to the late financier's case.",

    "body": "4 hours agoMadeline HalpertWatch: \"I will not back down\", says Don Lemon after pleading not guiltyFormer CNN host Don Lemon has pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from his coverage of a protest last month at a church over federal immigration raids in the US state of Minnesota.Lemon, 59, was charged with conspiracy to deprive rights and interfering with religious freedoms by allegedly obstructing someone's First Amendment rights by force.He was arrested after entering the Cities Church in St Paul on 18 January with protesters who said one of its pastors was an immigration enforcement official.He livestreamed the protest in an incident that resulted in charges for eight other people.Lemon did not speak as he entered the courtroom on Friday in St Paul, where two dozen protesters were gathered to support him, chanting \"[Attorney General] Pam Bondi has got to go\", according to the Associated Press. Four co-defendants who were there with Lemon also pleaded not guilty. Lemon has defended his decision to enter the church, saying he was simply carrying out his duty as an independent journalist covering a protest. \"I have spent my entire career covering the news. I will not stop now,\" he said soon after he was arrested. During Friday's hearing, one of Lemon's lawyers, Abbe Lowell, expressed concerns to the judge that investigators had taken Lemon's mobile phone when they arrested him in Los Angeles late last month, according to US media. Lemon and eight other co-defendants, including another journalist, have been charged with conspiracy against religious freedom at a place of worship and injuring, intimidating and interfering with the exercise of the right of religious freedom at a place of worship.In the 18 January incident, protesters interrupted a service the church by chanting \"ICE out\" and \"Justice for Renee Good\", the mother of three who was fatally shot by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer last month in Minneapolis. Lemon has said he was there as a journalist and not affiliated with the church protestors. Footage showed a chaotic scene unfolding inside the church, which belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention, as protesters and members of the congregation shout at each other.Federal agents killed a second protester, intensive care nurse Alex Pretti, in Minneapolis two weeks later. Both Pretti and Good were killed as they were protesting against the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts in Minnesota, an operation that has since ended. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in a social media post after Lemon's arrest that \"Trump will not tolerate the intimidation and harassment of Christians in their sacred places of worship\". A longstanding Trump critic, Lemon was fired from CNN in April 2023 after 17 years with the broadcaster. The morning show host had apologised for on-air comments that Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, then 51, was past her prime.ICE protester speaks out after White House shared fake arrest image",

    "body": "9 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorBloomberg via Getty ImagesPeter Magyar is ahead in the polls with less than two months to go before electionsLess than two months before Hungary's election, opposition leader Peter Magyar has accused his rivals of planning to blackmail him with a secretly recorded sex tape, and says he is filing a complaint with authorities.Magyar, who leads long-time Prime Minister Viktor Orban in the polls, said he suspected there were plans to release a tape of him from August 2024, when he says he engaged in consensual sex with a now ex-girlfriend at a party.He was responding to a photo recently posted online of a bedroom in an apartment dating back to then. Leading figures in Orban's Fidesz party said they knew nothing about the claims. The BBC has approached Orban's spokesman for comment.Magyar accused Fidesz of trying to blackmail him and made three allegations of unlawful conduct in a statement on Friday.Although no video has been published, he said one from that date would have been \"recorded with secret service equipment and possibly faked\".Magyar made no mention in his statement of the ex-girlfriend he had been with at the time of the alleged incident, although he said on Thursday he had accused her of extortion 15 months ago - an allegation she denied.She told Hungarian media that they were both victims regarding the alleged illicit video and she was ready to take legal action with him.Magyar accused Fidesz leaders of timing their campaign to coincide with the start of his nationwide campaign next week, and of trying to ruin the last week he was spending with his three sons ahead of the April election.Fidesz communications director Tamas Menczer accused Magyar of lying, while Orban's chief of staff Gergely Gulyas told reporters he could not comment on something he knew nothing about.Orban, Hungary's nationalist leader, has been in office for 16 years, but with parliamentary elections on 12 April, Magyar's centre-right Tisza party is at least eight points ahead in the latest opinion poll by Hungary's Idea Institute.Fidesz has so far focused its campaign on attacking the European Union, accusing Brussels of trying to bring down his government. He is seen as Vladimir Putin's closest ally in Europe and has called on the EU to stop sending money to Ukraine.On Friday, US President Donald Trump praised Orban as a \"truly strong and powerful leader\", ahead of a visit by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Trump said he had been \"proud to ENDORSE Viktor\" for re-election in 2022 and was \"honoured to do so again\".The election campaign is not even due to start until 21 February, but Magyar's allegations of dirty tricks are an indication of how murky the next few weeks may become.Magyar has built support across Hungary over the past two years, promising to reset relations with Hungary's European partners. A one-time Fidesz loyalist, he was once married to former justice minister Judit Varga, whose political career ended during a scandal in 2024. They divorced the year prior.",

    "body": "23 hours agoToby MannGetty ImagesJapanese authorities say they have seized a Chinese fishing vessel that tried to flee when ordered to stop for an inspection, in a move that may further fuel tensions with Beijing.The boat was in Japan's exclusive economic zone off Nagasaki Prefecture in the south-west when it was intercepted and its captain arrested on Thursday, according to the country's fisheries agency.\"The vessel's captain was ordered to stop for an inspection by a fisheries inspector, but the vessel failed to comply and fled,\" the fisheries agency said.The seizure is the first time since 2022 that the agency has seized a Chinese fishing boat. China has yet to react to Japan's statement. There were 11 people aboard, including the captain who is a 47-year-old Chinese national, the fisheries agency said. Authorities and Japanese media have described the seized vessel as a \"tiger net fishing boat\" with a high capacity.\"We will continue to take resolute action in our enforcement activities to prevent and deter illegal fishing operations by foreign vessels,\" Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said on Friday.Thursday's incident comes amid strained relations after Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi enraged China in November by suggesting Tokyo would intervene militarily if Beijing sought to take Taiwan by force.China has long insisted that Taiwan, occupied for decades by Japan until 1945, is its territory.It has not ruled out using force to achieve what it calls \"reunification\".In response to Takaichi's remarks, which China's foreign ministry described as \"egregious\", Beijing summoned Tokyo's ambassador and warned its citizens to reconsider travel and study in Japan.That led to a sharp drop in visits to Japan by Chinese tourists, and a subsequent hit to Japanese stocks related to tourism and retail.As the diplomatic spat deepened during the end of 2025, Beijing repeatedly demanded that Takaichi retract her comments, and its foreign ministry warned Japan to \"stop playing with fire\".Japanese artists touring China have also had shows cancelled and releases of popular Japanese movies have been postponed.",

    "body": "15 hours agoMichael Sheils McNameeFBIThe FBI has now confirmed that the masked man seen in the video is a suspect in the case The FBI has released the first physical description of the man believed to have kidnapped Nancy Guthrie, the mother of US news anchor Savannah Guthrie. Nancy Guthrie, 84, disappeared in the middle of night from her Tucson, Arizona home and was last seen two weeks ago. The authorities believe she was taken against her will.The FBI has analysed footage from a doorbell camera outside her home and believes she was kidnapped by a male who is between 5ft 9in and 5ft 10in (175-177cm) tall with an average build. It is first time the man in the video has been officially identified as a suspect in the case, which has drawn a huge amount of attention both in the US and abroad.The FBI said in its latest statement that it had been able to establish identifying details after carrying out a forensic analysis. It highlighted the backpack being worn by the suspect in the video, which was released earlier this week and identified it is a 25-litre Ozark Trail Hiker Pack.A pair of black gloves has also been found during the search for Guthrie, the BBC's US broadcast partner CBS reported on Thursday.FBINancy Guthrie was last seen on the evening of 31 January when family members dropped her home. Members of her church noticed her absence the following day and notified her family.Officials have warned that she may be in dire health without her medication. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said she was \"not in good physical health\" but had no reported cognitive issues.Since 1 February, the FBI said it had received more than 13,000 tips in relation to the case - including 4,000 in the 24 hours after the doorbell camera footage was released.It has now doubled the reward for information about Guthrie's disappearance from  $50,000 (£36,700) to $100,000. Getty ImagesThe reward for information related to the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie (right) has increased to $100,000Earlier this week, a man was detained in connection with Guthrie's disappearance and his home in Rio Rico - south of Tucson - was searched before he was released. He told reporters he did not know who Nancy Guthrie was.Savannah Guthrie and her two siblings have released a number of social media pleas directed at their mother's potential abductors. They believe she is still alive and have indicated they would be willing to pay for her return. ",

    "body": "11 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterGetty ImagesHello Kitty is a globally recognised brandThe designer behind Hello Kitty is stepping down after 46 years, during which time she oversaw the feline character achieving world recognition.Yuko Yamaguchi took over design duties for the character - who isn't actually a cat, but a little girl from London - in 1980, five years after she first launched.Hello Kitty was immediately popular in Japan, but over Yamaguchi's four-decade tenure it has become one of the most lucrative franchises in the world.Sanrio, the firm behind Hello Kitty, said Yamaguchi had \"passed the baton to the next generation\" as it thanked her for her work.Hello Kitty launched as the Japanese 'kawaii' culture - a hyperfeminine, girlish aesthetic - gained popularity across the world.Yamaguchi herself often wore Kitty-style dresses in public and piled her hair in buns.The designer, now aged 70, \"has grown Hello Kitty into a character loved by everyone\", Sanrio said on its website.Getty ImagesYuko Yamaguchi was known to dress like Hello Kitty at eventsThe company said one of its other designers, known only by the pseudonym \"Aya\", had already been working alongside Yamaguchi and will take over by the end of 2026.Yamaguchi will stay with Sanrio to provide advice and support.The Hello Kitty character first appeared on a coin purse in 1980 and has become a global marketing phenomenon.She has appeared on clothes, accessories, video games, and even an Airbus plane. She has partnered with brands such as Unicef, Nintendo and Balenciaga, and has also appeared in float form at the Macy's thanksgiving parade.There are Hello Kitty cafes around the world and a theme park in Japan. Another park is due to open in China.Unlike other Japanese exports such as Pokemon, there is little backstory to the character of Hello Kitty. Sanrio has said she \"isn't a human, [but] she's not quite a cat either\". She was born in London and has a twin sister named Mimmy and a boyfriend named Dear Daniel, according to Sanrio.Kitty will make her cinematic debut in a Warner Bros film in 2028. She has already appeared in several animated series but has never spoken, as she doesn't have a mouth.",

    "body": "3 hours agoAleks PhillipsGetty ImagesProsecutors in Paris have opened investigations into five baby formula manufacturers after several issued mass recalls over concerns their product contained a toxin.Nestle, Lactalis, Danone, Babybio and La Marque en moins will be probed over whether there was any criminal wrongdoing in distributing baby formula that may have been contaminated with cereulide.French authorities have received complaints from eight individuals who reported their child vomited after consuming baby formula.Last week, Nestle and Danone issued recalls in more than 60 countries, including the UK, over potentially contaminated batches.At least 36 infants in the UK have suffered from suspected food poisoning after consuming baby formula, officials have said.Cereulide is a toxin which is unlikely to be destroyed through cooking or when making baby milk. If consumed, it can cause nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps.The toxin in baby formula was linked to an ingredient called arachidonic acid (ARA) oil, which gives it some of the same growth properties as breast milk.The UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) earlier said a third-party supplier of ARA was the source of the contamination and was no longer being used.That supplier is now widely thought to be a Chinese firm, which Agence France-Presse identified as Wuhan-based Cabio Biotech. The BBC has approached the company for comment.On Thursday, China's national market regulator told domestic baby formula manufacturers to test for cereulide, without mentioning specific companies.Prosecutors in Paris will seek to establish whether the baby formula producers are liable for distributing a tainted product.It will be co-ordinated with local probes into whether there was a causal link between the contaminated formula and the deaths of three babies in France. Nestle and France's health ministry have stressed there was as-yet no evidence to indicate such a link.So far 28 batches of baby formula produced by Nestle, which makes SMA, and Danone, which makes Aptamil and Cow & Gate, have been recalled.Danone and Nestle have given assurances to the FSA that recalled batches were produced some time ago and were unlikely still to be on UK shop shelves. However, they may be in cupboards at home, which is why parents and caregivers are being asked to check their supplies.Nestle said on Friday that it intended to run five factories around the clock to increase baby formula production after the global recall. Those factories are in France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands.\"We are focused on increasing the availability of infant formula to meet demand, providing parents and families with high quality products they can trust,\" the Swiss firm said.",

I accepted her resignation, and I respect her decision.\"There is no suggestion that appearing in the millions of documents related to Epstein that have been released in the US implies any criminal wrongdoing. But the drip of revelations became a public relations headache for the Wall Street bank, where Ruemmler led its reputational risk committee. She joined Goldman in 2020.Ruemmler said in a statement to news agency Reuters earlier this month: \"I got to know him [Epstein] as a lawyer and that was the foundation of my relationship with him.\"I had no knowledge of any ongoing criminal conduct on his part, and I did not know him as the monster he has been revealed to be.\"The BBC has contacted Ruemmler for comment.Emails show she had a large number of communications with Epstein between 2014 and 2019, when she was in private practice after leaving the White House.Epstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a child and died while in custody facing sex trafficking charges in 2019.In one December 2015 email exchange, Ruemmler wrote to a redacted recipient. \"I adore him [Epstein]. It's like having another older brother!\"That message came after Epstein offered to buy her a first-class ticket to Europe, according to the BBC's US news partner CBS.Her exit from Goldman follows the release of handwritten notes from a law enforcement official who participated in Epstein's sex trafficking arrest in July 2019.The notes suggest that, on the night he was taken into custody, Epstein called Ruemmler, whose mobile phone number is redacted in the documents.She has said she never represented Epstein as a legal client.Communications from March 2019, four months before Epstein's arrest, show Ruemmler advising him on how to push back against media scrutiny that his 2008 plea deal was too lenient.\"Far from [receiving] a sweetheart deal, Mr Epstein was subjected to a lengthy, aggressive, [and] highly unusual federal investigation for what were, in essence, local [offences] of sexual solicitation,\" Ruemmler wrote.She suggests arguing that Epstein was being persecuted due to his \"wealth\".The emails also show that Epstein lavished Ruemmler with gifts, including flowers, wine, a Hermès bag, $10,000 (£7,300) in Bergdorf Goodman gift cards and an Apple watch.\"Am totally tricked out by Uncle Jeffrey today! Jeffrey boots, handbag, and watch!\" Ruemmler wrote in a 2019 message.Last month, a Goldman spokesman played down the gifts, saying: \"It's well known that Epstein often offered unsolicited favours and gifts to his many business contacts.\"Ruemmler's departure is the latest corporate resignation linked to the latest Epstein disclosures.Last week, Brad Karp, the chairman of prestigious US law firm Paul Weiss, stepped down after emails revealed he discussed Epstein's 2008 conviction with him.",

    "body": "6 hours agoJaroslav LukivEPA/ShutterstockThe rules-based world order \"no longer exists\", the German Chancellor has warned at a major security summit.Opening the annual Munich Security Conference, Friedrich Merz told other world leaders that \"our freedom is not guaranteed\" in an era of big power politics, and that Europeans must be ready to make \"sacrifice\".He also admitted that \"a deep divide has opened between Europe and the United States\".The conference is taking place on the backdrop of US President Donald Trump threatening Denmark's sovereignty over Greenland by pledging to annex the Arctic territory and his tariffs on imports from European nations.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was listening to Merz and will deliver his own speech on Saturday, earlier spoke of a \"new era in geopolitics\".Some 50 world leaders are expected to attend this year's conference, where European defence and the future of the transatlantic relationship will be discussed.It comes at a time when US commitments to the Nato military alliance have been called into question. Trump's ambition to acquire Greenland has also been viewed by many European leaders as a watershed moment that has eroded trust with their biggest ally.Trump told reporters outside the White House on Friday: \"Greenland's gonna want us... We get along very well with Europe. We'll see how it works out. We're negotiating right now for Greenland.\"The Russia-Ukraine war, tensions between the West and China, as well as a potential Iran-US nuclear deal are also on the agenda at the annual gathering.Referring to multiple warnings that the rules-based order was collapsing, Merz told the conference: \"I fear we must put it even more bluntly: this order, however imperfect it was even at its best, no longer exists in that form.\"He also said that \"a rift, a deep divide has opened between Europe and the United States. Vice-President JD Vance said this very openly here in Munich a year ago\".Merz continued: \"He was right. The culture war of the Maga [Make America Great Again] movement is not ours. Freedom of speech ends here with us when that speech goes against human dignity and the constitution. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade.\"Last year, Vance attacked Europe, including the UK, for policies on free speech and immigration. His speech triggered a year of unprecedented transatlantic tension.But Merz did not write off the decades-long partnership, instead appealing directly to the US by saying \"let's repair and revive transatlantic trust\".The German leader also revealed that \"confidential talks\" were ongoing with French President Emmanuel Macron on creating a joint European nuclear deterrent. He gave no further details.France and the UK are the only two nuclear powers in Europe - but Germany and many other European nations have traditionally relied on the US nuclear umbrella within the Nato alliance for deterrence.Addressing the conference later on Friday, Macron reiterated his call for Europe to \"learn to become a geopolitical power\" in the new global context.He said Europe was already re-arming following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 - but stressed that \"we have to accelerate\" and work collectively across the continent.Describing the war in Ukraine's as Europe's \"existential challenge\", the French leader urged others not to \"cave in to Russian demands\" - but rather to increase pressure on Moscow to achieve a just peace.\"We live in a new era in geopolitics, and it's going to require all of us to sort of re-examine what that looks like and what our role is going to be,\" he said.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said earlier in the day that she planned to meet Rubio to discuss the US threats to seize Greenland from its Nato ally.",

    "body": "3 hours agoAFP via Getty ImagesMinneapolis residents and students protesting against ICETwo immigration agents may have made \"untruthful statements\" in sworn testimony about the shooting of a migrant in Minneapolis last month, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has said.ICE acting director Todd Lyons said the two officers, who have not been named,  were immediately placed on administrative leave pending an internal investigation.\"Lying under oath is a serious federal offence,\" Lyons said. On Friday, a judge granted a request to drop charges against two men who were accused of attacking the officers.The Department of Homeland Security initially said a federal officer shot a man in the leg after being attacked with a shovel and broom handle by three migrants on 14 January.On Friday, Lyons said in a statement that the two officers appeared to have provided inaccurate testimony, and that the US attorney's office was actively investigating the matter.\"Video evidence has revealed that sworn testimony provided by two separate officers appears to have made untruthful statements,\" he said.\"Upon conclusion of the investigation, the officers may face termination of employment, as well as potential criminal prosecution,\" he added.After the 14 January incident, the DHS issued a statement saying the shooting happened after a car chase involving a Venezuelan national who was in the country illegally. After the pursuit the man got out of his car and an altercation broke out between him and the federal agent, it added.\"While the subject and law enforcement were in a struggle on the ground, two subjects came out of a nearby apartment and also attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle,\" the agency had claimed.\"As the officer was being ambushed and attacked by the two individuals, the original subject got loose and began striking the officer with a shovel or broom stick.\"The DHS statement went on to say, \"fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired defensive shots\". The three people then ran into an apartment and were later all arrested. Shortly after the incident, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said an agent was \"beat up, he's bruised, he is injured, he's getting treatment, and we're thankful that he made it out alive\".It was soon followed by a statement on X by US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche: \"Minnesota insurrection is a direct result of a FAILED governor and a TERRIBLE mayor encouraging violence against law enforcement. It's disgusting.\"Two men, Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna and Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, were charged with forcibly assaulting, resisting or impeding federal officers in performance of their official duties.Sosa-Celis was shot in the leg, and the DHS initially said Aljorna had fled the scene in the car, but officials later revised their version and said it was Aljorna - not Sosa-Celis - who fled. They also scaled back their earlier claim that three people had attacked the immigration agent. Charging documents indicated there were only two individuals involved.Watch: Protesters clash with authorities in Minneapolis after ICE shoot man in legOn Thursday, in an extraordinary reversal, Minnesota's top federal prosecutor Daniel N Rosen asked a judge to dismiss the charges against Aljorna and Sosa-Celis, saying that \"newly discovered evidence in this matter is materially inconsistent with the allegations\".The US attorney wrote that as a result, dismissing the case with prejudice - meaning it cannot be refiled - \"will serve the interests of justice\".On Friday, a judge granted the request and dismissed the case.Frederick Goetz, a lawyer representing Aljorna, said he was \"delighted\" by the decision to dismiss the charges with prejudice.Sosa-Celis' lawyer Robin Wolpert said his client was \"a crime victim\".\"These untruthful statements had serious consequences for my client and his family,\" he said. A third Venezuelan man, Gabriel Alejandro Hernandez Ledezma, who lived nearby was also arrested after the 14 January incident, but a court filing shows he was taken to an ICE detention facility in Texas, and was later returned to Minnesota and released by order of a federal judge.More than 4,000 undocumented immigrants were arrested during the campaign, he said.US border tsar: Minneapolis immigration enforcement surge ending",

    "body": "10 hours agoAnna LamcheandMarianne Baisnee,in ParisGettyA water leak at the Louvre has caused damage to a 19th Century ceiling painting, in the latest major setback for the Parisian museum.Water damage was discovered in room 707, also known as the \"Duchâtel\" room, late on Thursday night, the museum said. The room houses multiple 15th and 16th Century artworks.The museum said the leak - from a heating pipe - was stopped shortly after midnight and the only painting damaged was Charles Meynier's The Apotheosis of Poussin, Le Sueur and Le Brun.It comes a day after French police reportedly detained nine people - including two museum staff - over a suspected ticket fraud scheme.The Louvre said Thursday night's leak occurred at the entrance to the paintings department in the Denon wing.It said firefighters responded \"immediately\" and the leak was stopped 40 minutes after it began.A painting restorer inspected Meynier's ceiling painting on Friday morning and found it had \"two tears in the same area, caused by the water, and the paint layer on the ceiling and its arches has lifted\".The ceiling painting, signed by Meynier in 1822, depicts lauded French painters Nicolas Poussin, Eustache Le Sueur, and Charles Le Brun, who appear in the clouds among angelic figures.Rooms 706, 707 and 708 in the Denon wing on the building's first floor were closed on Friday morning, but are expected to reopen later in the day.The chief architect of historic monuments also came to assess the condition of the ceiling, the Louvre said, but found there were no structural problems.A union representative told news agency Reuters that scaffolding had been erected in the affected area.The cost of the damage to the painting and the building remains unclear.This leak is the latest in a long series of problems faced by the museum, which is the most visited in the world, in the recent past.The month prior, structural weaknesses prompted the partial closure of one of the galleries hosting Greek vases and offices.This came shortly after a high-profile heist on 19 October in which four burglars made off with historic jewellery worth €88m (£76m; $102m), exposing glaring gaps in the musuem's security.The brazen theft involved a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift, which was used to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine.A report published in October by France's public audit body criticised the museum's excessive spending on artwork, which it said was \"to the detriment of the maintenance and renovation of buildings.\"Musee du LouvreCharles Meynier's ceiling painting (pictured) suffered two tears and lifted paint due to the latest leak",

    "body": "1 hour agoMadeline HalpertandSakshi VenkatramanGetty ImagesJames Van Der Beek kept working after being diagnosed with cancerActor James Van Der Beek seemed to be everywhere in the 1990s and 2000s. With the title role in coming-of-age teen drama Dawson's Creek, he walked some of the industry's hottest red carpets, and his face plastered magazine covers - one even dubbing him a \"new superstar\".But when tragedy struck later in life, his family needed to rely on the kindness of his friends - and fans - for financial help, shedding light on the precarious financial situation of not just many actors, no matter how famous, but millions of everyday Americans struggling with medical bills.Van Der Beek - who had six children with his wife - died on Wednesday at the age of 48 after being diagnosed with colorectal cancer three years ago.The cost of his medical treatments were so financially draining, his wife says, that she has now made a public plea for donations so they would not lose their home. They have raised $2.3m (£1.7m) thus far.Getty ImagesJames Van Der Beek auctioned off the shirt he wore in this promotional stillIn the months before his death, Van Der Beek had shared how cash-strapped the cancer treatments had left him and his family. He even publicly auctioned off items he'd saved for decades from the roles that defined his career - a plaid buttoned shirt he wore in the first episode of Dawson's Creek, a necklace he gifted to Katie Holmes' character on the teen drama series and sports shoes he wore when he starred in the 1999 film Varsity Blues.\"I've been storing these treasures for years, waiting for the right time to do something with them, and with all of the recent unexpected twists and turns life has presented recently, it's clear that the time is now,\" Van Der Beek told People Magazine last November.On top of the costly treatments, Van Der Beek was not making the same cash that he'd seen in the prime of his career decades ago. He had said he was paid \"almost nothing\" for Dawson's Creek and his contract didn't include residuals - payments writers, actors and directors receive when their work is re-aired on television. Actors on other still-popular shows from that same period, like Friends, are said to make about $20m annually from such payments.\"There was no residual money,\" Van Der Beek told Today in 2012.  \"I was 20.  It was a bad contract. I saw almost nothing from that.\"He continued working after his diagnosis, appearing in two episodes of the television show Overcompensating in 2025, but it's unclear whether that was enough to qualify him for health insurance from the prominent actors' union in Hollywood. Actors can qualify for health insurance through SAG-AFTRA only if they work 108 days a year or earn at least $28,090 on union shoots. The BBC has contacted the union.Van Der Beek is not the first high-profile American actor to highlight the issue. Beverly Hills 90210 star Shannen Doherty, who died in 2024, said she did not have insurance when she was first diagnosed with breast cancer.Getty ImagesVan Der Beek and his Dawson's Creek co-stars pictured in 1997Benjamin Byron Davis, 53, an actor who has appeared on television shows as well as in movies like Marvel's Ant Man, told the BBC that decreased residuals have become a problem for actors across the board.\"Revenue streams that actors have depended upon have disappeared,\" he said, noting that the rise of streaming has affected how production companies compensate performers. He said many actors depend on these payments both for income and to qualify for health insurance through their union SAG-AFTRA. \"I work when I'm hired and I survive when I'm not.\"Davis said he lost his health insurance during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strikes. \"There wasn't work,\" he said, adding that he ended up getting it back when the strikes were over and he was able to meet the qualifications again.Davis said that just 10 years ago, the union's minimum earnings for health insurance was a third of what it is now, at a level today that is out of reach for the vast majority of actors.Those who are covered by the union plan get good health coverage, said Valerie Yaros, an archivist with SAG-AFTRA.But it was possible Van Der Beek no longer received the union plan because of his fewer work hours, she added.In 2024, Van Der Beek told People that it had become a \"full-time job\" dealing with cancer treatment appointments and his insurance.A heated debate on health insuranceHis death put a new celebrity face on the debate about rising healthcare costs in the US - an issue that Republicans and Democrats have long recognised needs reform but have disagreed on the best ways to resolve the problem.The US has one of the most expensive health systems in the world, with spending on health care estimated to reach $5.9tn in 2026, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.About 100 million people in the US are estimated to struggle to pay off their medical and dental healthcare debt, according to recent data.The GoFundMe page posted online on Wednesday solicited donations to assist Van Der Beek's widow Kimberley and their six children, whose ages range from 4 to 15.His wife shared the page, which noted the \"significant financial strain\" the family had seen as they \"did everything possible to support James and provide for his care\".\"In the wake of this loss, Kimberly and the children are facing an uncertain future. The costs of James's medical care and the extended fight against cancer have left the family out of funds,\" the page reads. \"They are working hard to stay in their home and to ensure the children can continue their education and maintain some stability during this incredibly difficult time.\"Even with health insurance, cancer treatment can prove extremely costly for those in the US. Some studies suggest the average monthly cost of chemotherapy can range from $1,000 to $12,000.This is because in the US private health-care system, even those with insurance can face high deductibles and thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs, said Eva Stahl, the vice president of policy at Undue Medical Debt, a nonprofit that has paid off about $25bn of medical debt for almost 15 million people.\"People simply can't afford vital, life-saving treatments without going into debt,\" she said. \"When even someone with James Van Der Beek's resources has no option but to fundraise for treatment, it's clear how fundamentally unfair our healthcare system is.\"Michael Short, a graphic artist in Tennessee who has had his own battles with medical debt, told the BBC that his sister has had to declare bankruptcy because of medical debt for treatments for her endometrial and another cancer, even with insurance coverage.\"It's in the hundreds of thousands if not millions for these cancer treatments,\" he said. \"The prices on these medications and on these treatments are just so high.\"More weekend picks",

    "body": "South Africa to deploy troops to tackle crime gangs15 hours agoWycliffe MuiaGetty ImagesSoldiers will be deployed to the Western Cape and Gauteng, provinces hard hit by gang violence and illegal mining respectivelySouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa said he will deploy the army to help the police fight criminal gangs and illegal mining in the country.Gang violence is a major problem in South Africa, which has one of the world's highest murder rates.\"Organised crime is now the most immediate threat to our democracy, our society and our economic development,\" Ramaphosa said in his annual State of the Nation Address (Sona) on Thursday.\"I will be deploying the South African National Defence Force to support the police,\" he added. In his address to parliament, Ramaphosa said he had directed the chiefs of the police and army to draw up a plan on where \"our security forces should be deployed within the next few days\". He said the military deployment would start in the provinces of Western Cape and Gauteng, home to the cities of Cape Town and Johannesburg, because of rising gang violence and illegal mining respectively.\"Children here in the Western Cape are caught in the crossfire of gang wars. People are chased out of their homes by illegal miners in Gauteng,\" said Ramaphosa. Authorities blame illegal miners, known as \"zama zamas\", typically armed, undocumented foreign nationals, for their involvement in organised crime syndicates.Ramaphosa ruled out deploying troops to Cape Town just two weeks ago, saying soldiers were trained for combat and not community policing. He did not explain why he changed his mind but there have been increasing calls for him to take action to tackle gang violence.Beyond the military deployment, Ramaphosa announced additional measures to combat crime, including recruiting 5,500 police officers, strengthening intelligence, and targeting crime syndicates.South Africa, the continent's most industrialised nation, has long struggled with entrenched organised crime.Police data shows that an average of 63 people were killed each day between April and September last year.More about South Africa from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "1 day agoEmma Pengelly,BBC VerifyandGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianVantorIran has been fortifying an underground complex near one of its nuclear facilities, according to analysis of new satellite images.This activity comes at a time of heightened tensions as talks between Iranian and US officials continue, with President Donald Trump threatening fresh military action against Iran if it does not agree a new deal on its nuclear programme.The photos, first analysed by the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS), a US-based think tank, show tunnel entrances being strengthened at Mount Kolang Gaz La - also known as Pickaxe Mountain.Experts say this facility may be designed to protect Iran's uranium enrichment activities or key equipment, but its exact purpose - and whether it is operational - remains unclear.Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and denies it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.However, Trump said Iran was as little as a month away from having a nuclear weapon in June 2025, when he ordered strikes on three underground nuclear sites where centrifuges were being used to produce highly enriched uranium during a 12-day war between Israel and Iran last year.Trump said the strikes had \"obliterated\" Iran's enrichment capacity, but that Iranian officials \"were thinking about starting a new site\".Pickaxe Mountain was not one of the locations attacked in US and Israeli air strikes in June 2025, but the Natanz nuclear facility, located about 2km (1.24 miles) north, was hit.A satellite image from 10 February shows what appears to be fresh concrete laid on top of one of the Pickaxe Mountain entrance areas.A boom pump used to deliver concrete can be seen at the location, analysts from both ISIS and UK-based intelligence analysis firm Maiar agreed.At another tunnel entrance, rock and soil has been pushed back and flattened. There's also a new concrete-reinforced structure nearby.Experts at ISIS suggest these changes are intended to strengthen the tunnel entrances and give additional protection against a potential air strike.ISIS says the ongoing presence of heavy construction machinery and material indicates the facility is not likely to be ready for operations yet.\"In the past, Iran has tied the construction to rebuilding an advanced centrifuge assembly plant, but the size of the facility, as well as the protection provided by the tall mountain, raised immediate concern whether additional sensitive activities are planned, such as uranium enrichment,\" they said.Satellite images also show repair work and defensive strengthening has been taking place at the nearby Natanz nuclear site and at the Isfahan nuclear complex, 125km (77 miles) to the north, in recent weeks.At Isfahan, all entrances to its tunnel complex now appear to be sealed off with earth, satellite images reviewed by ISIS reveal..Backfilling the tunnel entrances like this would \"help dampen\" any air strike, ISIS says, as well as help to defend against a land-based assault to seize or destroy any highly enriched uranium that may be housed inside..ISIS has assessed the roof was added to block the view of anyone trying to observe what Iran was doing beneath it.Prof Sina Azodi, director of the Middle East Studies Program at George Washington University in the US, says Iran is \"operating under the assumption that the attacks are going to happen and they need to protect the facilities as much as they can\".\"[The] Iranian nuclear programme hasn't been destroyed,\" he added. \"Clearly once you have the knowledge and capacity and technology to reconstruct the programme, you can always rebuild everything.\"Rafael Grossi, the head of the global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, told the BBC a new nuclear deal between Iran and the US was possible and was urgently needed.\"My sense, talking to all those involved, is that we have a window of opportunity, but windows of opportunity have a tendency to shut themselves quite abruptly and brusquely, so I think the we need to seize the moment,\" he said in an interview at the Munich Security Conference.He also said he believed Iran's estimated 400kg of highly enriched uranium - which is a short, technical step away from weapons grade - remained in the underground tunnels and chambers where the US dropped bunker-busting bombs last June.Graphics by Tom ShielMore on this story",

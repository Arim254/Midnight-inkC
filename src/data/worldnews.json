    "body": "12 hours agoJaroslav LukivReutersThe bus fell into a three-metre-wide ice fissure on Lake Baikal on FridayRussian authorities say divers have recovered the bodies of seven Chinese tourists and a Russian driver who died after their mini-bus plunged under the ice to the bottom of Lake Baikal in Siberia. Irkutsk regional Governor Igor Kobzev offered his \"deepest condolences to the families and friends of the victims\". He earlier said one Chinese tourist had managed to escape. The depth at the site of Friday's accident was 18m (59ft), and the divers had to use underwater cameras to search for the bodies.Baikal - the world's deepest lake with a maximum depth of 1,642m (5,387ft) - is a popular tourist destination. It often freezes during harsh winters and has seen a number of deadly accidents over the years.The bus fell into three-metre-wide ice fissure on Friday, Kobzev said in a post on Telegram.\"I would like to remind you once again that going out onto Lake Baikal's ice is not just prohibited right now. It's mortally dangerous,\" the governor said, urging tourists to use only official tour operators.He added that all the Chinese tourists - including a 14-year-old child - had travelled independently. A criminal investigation into the cause of the tragedy is now under way.Shortly afterwards Kobzev took to social media again, saying that \"sadly, even this tragedy hasn't taught people a lesson\", informing that six people trapped in their cars had been rescued in two separate incidents on Friday and Saturday.In late January, a Chinese tourist died after a car he was travelling overturned on the frozen surface of Lake Baikal.",

    "body": "6 minutes agoOttilie MitchellReutersVenezuelan Interim President Delcy Rodríguez and her brother National Assembly President Jorge Rodríguez at Miraflores Palace in CaracasA total of 1,557 Venezuelan political prisoners have applied for amnesty under a new law introduced on Thursday, the country's National Assembly President has said. Jorge Rodríguez, brother of Venezuelan interim President Delcy Rodríguez and an ally of former President Nicolás Maduro, also said \"hundreds\" of prisoners had  already been released. Among them is politician Juan Pablo Guanipa, one of several opposition voices to have criticised the law for excluding certain prisoners.The US has urged Venezuela to speed up its release of political prisoners since US forces seized Maduro in a raid on 3 January. Venezuela's socialist government has always denied holding political prisoners.At a news conference on Saturday Jorge Rodríguez said 1,557 release requests were being addressed \"immediately\" and ultimately the legislation would extend to 11,000 prisoners.The government first announced days after Maduro's capture, on 8 January, that \"a significant number\" of prisoners would be freed as a goodwill gesture.Opposition and human rights groups have said the government under Maduro used detentions of political prisoners to stamp out dissent and silence critics for years. These groups have also criticised the new law. One frequently cited criticism is that it would not extend amnesty to those who called for foreign armed intervention in Venezuela, BBC Latin America specialist Luis Fajardo says.He noted that law professor Juan Carlos Apitz, of the Central University of Venezuela, told CNN Español that that part of the amnesty law \"has a name and surname\". \"That paragraph is the Maria Corina Machado paragraph.\" It is not clear if the amnesty would actually cover Machado, who won last year's Nobel Peace Prize, Fajardo said.He added that other controversial aspects of the law include the apparent exclusion from amnesty benefits of dozens of military officers involved in rebellions against the Maduro administration over the years.On Saturday, Rodríguez said it is \"releases from Zona Seven of El Helicoide that they're handling first\". Those jailed at the infamous prison in Caracas would be released \"over the next few hours\", he added.Activists say some family members of those imprisoned in the facility have gone on hunger strike to demand the release of their relatives.Maduro is awaiting trial in custody in the US alongside his wife Cilia Flores and has pleaded not guilty to drugs and weapons charges, saying that he is a \"prisoner of war\".",

    "body": "8 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykEPA/ ShutterstockNasa has said that its 6 March launch day for its long-awaited lunar mission is now \"out of consideration\", after it spotted several last minute issues during routine checks that would prevent lift off. On Friday, the space agency said that its Artemis II mission, which would see astronauts sent to the moon for the first time in 50 years, would likely have the green light to launch within a matter of weeks. But NASA administrator Jared Isaacman announced on Saturday that setbacks would mean that further maintenance would have to be carried out. Four astronauts are preparing to be sent on the 10-day trip to the far side of the Moon and back, marking humanity's furthest ever journey into space. Isaacman said he understood \"that people are disappointed by this development\", after almost 50-hours of checks on Thursday revealed no faults. The agency felt almost certain that its \"wet rehearsal\" had been a success, leading the team to announce that the launch could take place as soon as 6 March. But overnight on Friday, engineers observed an interruption in the flow of helium required for launch operations.Disruption to helium, which is used to pressurise fuel tanks and cool rocket systems, is treated as a serious technical issue, according to Nasa. Nasa targets early March to send humans back around the MoonThe test was the scientists' second attempt at a practice run at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, having fixed earlier issues with filters and seals that had led to hydrogen leaks. The rocket was fuelled with around 730,000 ​gallons of propellant over several hours on Thursday, with the team stating that the simulation felt like \"a big step in us earning our right to fly\". But space missions are often fraught with setbacks, Isaaman said, highlighting that Neil Armstrong's 1966 Gemini 8 mission ended prematurely due to a technical issue, before his historic moon landing three years later. Three US astronauts, Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, and Canadian astronaut, Jeremy Hanse, are due to take off in the mega Moon rocket, which will allow them several hours to study the moon's surface up close. It is hoped that the mission, if successful, will pave the way for Artemis III, which will see astronauts set foot on the Moon for the first time since 1972. Nasa says the landing will happen by 2028, but accepted this could be an ambitious time frame. ",

Researchers selected 23 hybrid tortoises with the closest genetic links to the extinct subspecies and began breeding them in captivity on Santa Cruz island.By 2025, more than 600 hatchlings had been produced, with several hundred now large enough to survive in the wild.The GCT described the giant tortoises as \"ecosystem engineers\" and said they played an \"outsized role in restoring degraded ecosystems\" because of the way their activity shapes landscapes.More on this story",

After her parents' divorce, she is said to have brought up her own siblings.She became a reporter for the Sydney Daily Telegraph and the Sydney Daily Mirror, where she met Rupert Murdoch and went on to serve on the board of his company.\"He never made a major business decision without her input\", The Australian, another title in his media stable, writes.She penned several novels during their marriage, including the 1988 Family Business about a multi-generational media dynasty.

A years-long court battle ended with Murdoch's eldest son, Lachlan, being set to control the news group late last year.Murdoch-Mann went on to remarry, first to financier William Mann, who died in 2017. She later wed her third husband, Ashton dePeyster, who survives her along with 10 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.The philanthropist served on the boards of several children's hospitals including in Los Angeles and Haiti. In 1998, she was made a Dame of the Order of St Gregory by Pope John Paul II.",

The teenager was airlifted to hospital from the slope in Nauders near the Swiss-Italian border.Three other skiers were killed in an avalanche near the popular St Anton resort, while a snowboarder died after being buried in the neighbouring Vorarlberg region.Austria has now seen at least 21 avalanche-related deaths this winter, while dozens of fatalities have been recorded across the Alps.The avalanche risk remains high in parts of Tyrol - meaning avalanches can be expected - where two fatal avalanches occurred on Friday in off-piste areas.Police told Austrian media the avalanche near St Anton am Arlberg, which killed three men, appeared to have been triggered by the skiers themselves.Two were American and Polish nationals, public broadcaster ORF reported, while the third was a 21-year-old Austrian who died in hospital.Two other men were recovered from the scene with injuries after a major operation involving four mountain rescue teams, three helicopters, as well as emergency services.Elsewhere, a 53-year-old man died after being crushed by a snow plough in the northern city of Linz.The vehicle slid down a set of stairs where the man had been clearing snow, ORF reported. He died at the scene.The significant snowfall in the region also caused power outages and transport chaos on Friday, particularly in the south-east.The Red Cross was deployed to help those stuck in traffic jams in the state of Styria, where a motoring organisation described the roads as \"virtually inaccessible to private vehicles\".Vienna International Airport temporarily closed in the morning, and afternoon services were \"disrupted\".The avalanche death toll in the Alps has been higher than usual this year, and includes three Britons killed in France's La Grave earlier this month.",

The Trump administration said it stood ready to provide consular assistance, but did not respond to claims its policies had failed to stem a surge in settler violence.The Israeli embassy in Washington said the incident was under review and an \"operational inquiry... must be completed as soon as possible\".Abu Siyam was a US citizen born in Philadelphia.His family said he was among approximately 30 residents of the village of Mukhmas who were trying to stop armed settlers from stealing their goats on Wednesday. As both residents and settlers threw stones, said one witness, settlers shot at least three of the villagers, including Abu Siyam, who was struck fatally. Abdulhamid Siyam, cousin to Abu Siyam, told the BBC that the 19-year-old's death was a \"big loss\" and the actions of settlers in the West Bank had gone unchecked.\"A young man of 19 shot and killed in this cold blood and no responsibility, impunity completely,\" he said.The Trump administration has faced criticism from rights groups for lifting Biden-era sanctions on violent settlers, who have rarely faced criminal punishments from Israeli authorities. The US State Department said it was aware of the death of a US citizen and was \"carefully monitoring the situation\". On Saturday it released an updated statement saying it extends \"deepest condolences\" to the family of the victim and expects \"a full, thorough, and transparent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death\". It added the US embassy in Jerusalem had been in direct contact with the family to provide assistance.A spokesperson for the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) said that soldiers had attended the scene and used \"riot dispersal means to restore order\". \"No IDF fire  was reported during the course of the incident,\" the IDF statement said. The spokesperson confirmed that the incident was under review, and said \"a continuous military presence\" would remain in the area in the coming days to prevent further incidents.",

    "body": "13 hours agoMaia Davies''Domenico is gone'' says mother of toddler who died after receiving damaged heartA toddler in Italy who received a damaged donor heart has died, the family's lawyer has said.Two-year-old Domenico died shortly before 09:30 local time (08:30 GMT) on Saturday, Francesco Petruzzi told reporters. Monaldi Hospital, where he was being treated, said he had suffered a \"sudden and irreversible worsening of his clinical condition\".The heart given to Domenico during a transplant in late December was reportedly transported to the hospital in direct contact with dry ice, causing severe tissue damage.Prosecutors have opened an investigation into the incident and six medics have been placed under formal investigation in a case which has sparked outrage in Italy.Petruzzi has said the organ arrived \"burned by frostbite\" after being transported over 800km (490 miles) from Bolzano to Naples in an unsuitable container alongside the ice, without a thermometer to alert the medical team to the low temperature.The two-year-old had been on life support in Naples for almost two months. His mother Patrizia Mercolino had appealed to the Pope to help her son.\"It's over. Domenico is gone,\" Mercolino told reporters on Saturday.She said a foundation would be established in his name.The family's lawyer said the foundation would be for \"all children who cannot have a transplant and to help all victims of malpractice and medical negligence\".Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the \"whole of Italy mourns the loss of little Domenico, a warrior who will never be forgotten\".She wrote on X: \"On behalf of myself and the government, I offer my sincerest condolences and deepest sympathy to his mother Patrizia, his father Antonio and all his loved ones.\"I am certain that the competent authorities will shed full light on this terrible incident.\"On Wednesday, a panel of paediatric specialists concluded Domenico's condition was \"not compatible\" with another transplant.Doctors had warned a prolonged use of the life support system might have compromised his lungs, liver and kidneys.Petruzzi said at the time the family wanted to see all the relevant medical records: \"If the time for hope has ended, then the time for responsibility has begun.\"Italy's Health Minister Orazio Schillaci said earlier this week that \"we must absolutely clarify what happened\".\"We owe it to the child, to the family, but also to all Italians.\"\"We have an excellent national health service, which has been able to handle and almost always resolve complex situations. So, I believe citizens should not lose faith.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondentEPAIsraeli air strikes have killed at least 10 people in eastern Lebanon, Lebanese officials say, despite a ceasefire.Israel's military said it had targeted sites belonging to Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim militia and political party, in the Bekaa Valley, an area where the group has a strong presence.Hezbollah confirmed that at least eight of its members had been killed, including a senior field commander.The strikes were among the deadliest in Lebanon since a ceasefire ended the war between Israel and Hezbollah in November 2024.Despite the deal, which followed 13 months of conflict, Israel has carried out near-daily strikes on Lebanon, on targets it says are linked to the group, which is supported by Iran.Images posted online from one of the locations hit on Friday night showed heavy damage in what appeared to be a residential neighbourhood.In a statement, the Israeli military said it had struck what it described as Hezbollah command centres and that the group \"systematically embeds its assets within the civilian population\". It said the group's activities were \"a violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon\".In a separate statement on Saturday, the military said it had \"eliminated several terrorists of Hezbollah's missile array in three different command centres... recently identified as operating to accelerate the organisation's readiness and force build-up processes, while planning fire attacks towards Israel\".Hezbollah, considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US, says the ceasefire deal only applies to southern Lebanon, in the area between the Litani river and the Blue Line, the unofficial border between Lebanon and Israel.The group, however, has so far rejected calls from Lebanese authorities to discuss the future of its weapons elsewhere in the country, including in the Bekaa Valley, where part of its arsenal is believed to be located.This week, Hezbollah dismissed a decision by the government to advance the second phase of the disarmament plan in areas between north of the Litani and the Awali river, in the port city of Sidon.Lebanon's government says Israel's ongoing actions are a violation of the ceasefire deal and has urged the international community to put pressure on Israel to stop its attacks. Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam recently said the situation had become a \"one-sided war of attrition\".Hours before the attacks in the east, an Israeli strike hit the densely populated Palestinian refugee camp of Ain al-Helweh, on the outskirts of Sidon, in the country's south.The Israeli military said it had struck a \"command centre\" that had been used by Hamas, which said two members had been killed.The strikes come amid heightened tensions in the region, with the United States threatening to attack Iran if negotiations between the two countries fail to reach a deal.There are concerns in Lebanon that Iran might force Hezbollah to join its response to an attack if Israel becomes involved.",

    "body": "22 hours agoOttilie MitchellReutersEight people were killed in a mass shooting in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia earlier in FebruaryOpenAI banned a ChatGPT account owned by the suspect of a mass shooting in British Columbia more than half a year before the attack took place.The AI company said they had identified an account owned by Jesse Van Rootselaar in June 2025 under abuse and enforcement detection, which includes identifying accounts being used to further violence.OpenAI said it did not alert authorities to the account because its usage did not meet its threshold of a credible or imminent plan for serious physical harm to others.It said its thoughts were with everyone affected by the tragedy and that following the attack it had \"proactively\" contacted Canadian police with information on the suspect.Van Rootselaar is suspected of having shot and killed eight people in rural Tumbler Ridge on 12 February in one of the deadliest attacks in Canada's history. According to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the story, \"about a dozen staffers debated whether to take action on Van Rootselaar's posts.\"Some had identified the suspect's usage of the AI tool as an indication of real world violence and encouraged leaders to alert authorities, the US outlet reported. But, it said, leaders of the company decided not to do so.In a statement, a spokesperson for OpenAI said: \"In June 2025, we proactively identified an account associated with this individual [Jesse Van Rootselaar] via our abuse detection and enforcement efforts, which include automated tools and human investigations to identify misuses of our models in furtherance of violent activities.\"They said the company would continue to support the police's investigation.The BBC has contacted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for comment.OpenAI has said it will uphold its policy of alerting authorities only in cases of imminent risk because alerting them too broadly could cause unintended harm. It has also said that it trains ChatGPT to discourage imminent real-world harm when it identifies a dangerous situation and to refuse to help people that are attempting to use the service for illegal activities.The company added that it is constantly reviewing its referral criteria with experts and that it is reviewing the case for improvements. The deadly attack on Tumbler Ridge Secondary School saw a further 27 people injured.Van Rootselaar was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the school. Police said the suspect was born a biological male but identified as a woman.Van Rootselaars's mother and step-brother were among the victims of the shooting. Both were found dead at a local residence, police said.The motive for the attack is not yet known.",

    "body": "1 day agoBernd Debusmann Jr,White House reporterandCachella SmithGetty ImagesIran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has said a proposal for an agreement with the US will be ready in daysUS President Donald Trump has said he is considering a limited military strike on Iran in order to pressure its leaders to agree a deal to curb the nuclear programme.The president made the remark in response to a question from a journalist hours after officials had suggested the possibility of a strike.On Thursday, Trump said the world would find out \"over the next, probably, 10 days\" whether a deal would be reached or the US would take military action. The US has been increasing its military presence in the region in recent weeks.The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something Iran has always denied.  US and Iranian officials have met over the issue in Switzerland and said progress has been made in the talks.Speaking on Friday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Iran was preparing \"a draft of a possible agreement\" and would hand it over to US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff in the next few days.The talks in Geneva were held as American forces continued ramping up their presence in the vicinity of Iran.The deployment includes the world's largest warship, USS Gerald R Ford, appearing to be heading towards the region.USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier is also being deployed, joining an increase of destroyers, combat ships and fighter jets.Satellite images have also shown that Iran has reinforced military facilities, and the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei, has posted messages to social media threatening US forces.\"The US President constantly says that the US has sent a warship toward Iran. Of course, a warship is a dangerous piece of military hardware,\" one of Khamenei's posts read.Trump takes questions from journalists several times a week - often in lengthy sessions in the Oval Office or on Air Force One - but his comments do not necessarily always translate into concrete actions, and often contradict each other.He is fond of reminding reporters that he prefers to keep his intentions to himself and a small circle of insiders to avoid potential adversaries knowing his next moves.\"I'm not going to talk to you about that,\" he snapped at a reporter on Thursday when asked about potential military action. \"We're going to make a deal or get a deal one way or the other.\"Even if an operation is carried out, Trump has so far yet to specify what the precise military objective would be, with US officials having reportedly presented him with a wide range of options for what could be a weeks-long campaign.In the past, Trump has also used deadlines to achieve an element of surprise.At the time of Operation Midnight Hammer in July last year - which saw US forces strike Iranian nuclear facilities - White House officials were still publicly discussing the possibility of successful talks.The day before US missiles and bombs struck the facility, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt read a statement from Trump in which he said that because \"negotiations may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks\".Any strikes in the near future would come at a challenging time domestically for the Trump administration, with polls showing that a growing number of Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of immigration and the economy.Unlike the one-day strike in Iran last year and the quick operation to capture Nicolás Maduro in January, a protracted, multi-week conflict with Iran threatens alienating parts of Trump's Maga base which were drawn to his campaign promise of an end to messy foreign entanglements.",

    "body": "3 hours agoNardine SaadLos Angeles, California Getty ImagesThe famed trombonist started his music career as a child playing the trumpet, but shifted to his iconic trombone that he played on street corners in the Bronx.Salsa music pioneer Willie Colón, the trombonist and orchestra leader behind songs like El Malo, Oh, Qué Será, Talento de Televisión and Gitana, has died aged 75, US media reports.The Grammy nominated singer-songwriter \"passed away peacefully\" on Saturday morning \"surrounded by his loving family\", his family said on social media. No cause of death was provided.\"While we grieve his absence, we also rejoice in the timeless gift of his music and the cherished memories he created that will love on forever,\" they said. The Puerto Rican musician, who sang in Spanish and whose career spanned nearly 60 years, had been named among the most influential Latino artists of all time by Billboard magazine.US media attributed Colón's death on Saturday to a statement posted by his family on Facebook and a tribute posted by his long-time manager, Pietro Carlos. The BBC has contacted representatives for Colón.Colón - who was also an arranger and producer - explored \"the competing associations that Puerto Ricans have with their home and with the United States,\" according a biography posted on the LA Philharmonic website.\"He uses his songs to depict and investigate the problems of living in the U.S. as a Puerto Rican and also to imply the cultural contributions that Puerto Ricans have to offer.\"He grew up in New York in an environment marked by Latin migration, street life and Caribbean music as the salsa sound emerged in the US state in the 1960s, the BBC's Mundo said, mixing jazz, mambo, jíbara music and chachachá.\"Today, We've lost an architect of the New York sound, a trombonist who made metals his banner and wrote eternal chapters in music history,\" his manager Pietro Carlos said in a statement on social media.\"From 'El Malo' to anthems that defined generations, his work wasn't just music, it was identity, neighborhood, consciousness, and resistance.\"Carlos said that Colón expanded and politicised salsa music, taking it to stages where it hadn't been heard before. Colón, he explained, used his trombone to echo the sound of the Caribbean in New York and bridge the two cultures. Recently, the salsa legend was name-checked in Nuevayol by Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny and briefly appeared in the song's music video. Bad Bunny paid homage to Colón in the song's lyrics, singing: \"Willie Colón, me dicen el malo, ey. Porque pasan los años y sigo dando palo,\" which translates to \"Willie Colón, they say I'm bad, because the years come and I'm still hitting.\"William Anthony Colón Román was born on April 28, 1950 in South Bronx, New York to Puerto Rican parents. His grandmother Antonia taught him Spanish and reminded him of the most recognisable elements of Puerto Rican culture, according to a biography from the National Foundation for Popular Culture.The famed trombonist started his music career as a child, playing the trumpet at age 12, but later shifted to his iconic trombone, playing on street corners in the neighbourhood. In 1967, at 16, he recorded his first album El Malo with Héctor Lavoe, forming an inimitable salsa duo for the Fania record label that popularised the songs Calle Luna, calle Sol, Abuelita,  Ah, ah, oh, no, Ghana'e, El día de mi suerte, La murga and Juana Peña.In 1972, he released El Malo - one of the first albums to feature the \"New York Sound\" that sparked a renewed interest in Latin music during the 1970s, according to his website.He also produced music alongside Rubén Blades, Celia Cruz and Ismael Miranda, and, as a solo artist, continued to relentlessly pursue new musical fusions, such as  El Gran Varón, Oh, Qué Será  and Amor Verdadero.Throughout his career, the artist accumulated more than 40 productions, 30 million copies sold, 15 gold records, five platinum records, and 10 Grammy nominations.In the 1970s, the orchestra leader introduced Panamanian singer-songwriter Rubén Blades to lead the outfit. In 1975, they released the album Metiendo Mano! - a collaboration said to be his first foray into intellectual salsa that paved the way for the classic albums Maestra Vida and Canciones del Solar de los Aburridos.Their second album Siembra - featuring disco rhythm, congas and timbales on Plastico - delved further into political fare and sold more than 3 million records worldwide, becoming a bestseller for the time and among the most consequential albums for the genre.The Latin Recording Academy, the professional organisation behind the Latin Grammy Awards, paid tribute to Colón  on social media as a man whose legacy \"transformed salsa by making it a global phenomenon, establishing a sound and aesthetic that defined an era and continued to inspire generations of artists\".Colón was recognised with the Latin Grammys' Musical Excellence Award - a lifetime achievement honour - in 2004. With nearly 40 albums to his credit, Colón also became known as a prominent social activist who supported the Latino Commission on AIDS and the United Nations Immigrant Foundation, and served as a board member at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute.In 2014, graduated from a police academy in New York and was sworn in as a deputy sheriff for the Department of Public Safety.Colón is survived by his wife, Julia Craig, whom he wed in 1991, and their children.",

    "body": "Iran students stage first large anti-government protests since deadly crackdown7 hours agoSiavash Mehdi-Ardalan,BBC PersianandJaroslav LukivScuffles break out at Sharif University in TehranStudents at several universities in Iran have staged anti-government protests - the first such rallies on this scale since last month's deadly crackdown by the authorities.The BBC has verified footage of demonstrators marching on the campus of the Sharif University of Technology in the capital Tehran on Saturday. Scuffles were later seen breaking out between them and government supporters. A sit-in was held at another Tehran university, and a rally reported in the north-east. Students were honouring thousands of those killed in mass protests in January.The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something Iran has always denied.US and Iranian officials met in Switzerland on Tuesday and said progress had been made in talks aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear programme.But despite the reported progress, Trump said afterwards that the world would find out \"over the next, probably, 10 days\" whether a deal would be reached with Iran or the US would take military action. The US leader has supported protesters in the past - at one stage appearing to encourage them with a promise that \"help is on its way\". Footage verified by the BBC shows hundreds of protesters - many with national Iranian flags - peacefully marching on the campus of the Sharif University of Technology at the start of a new semester on Saturday.The crowds chanted \"death to the dictator\" - a reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - and other anti-government slogans.Supporters of a rival pro-government rally are seen nearby in the video. Scuffles are later seen breaking out between the two camps.Verified photos have also emerged showing a peaceful sit-in protest at the capital's Shahid Beheshti University.The BBC have also verified footage from another Tehran university, Amir Kabir University of Technology, showing chanting against the government.In Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city in the north-east, local students reportedly chanted: \"Freedom, freedom\" and \"Students, shout, shout for your rights\".Sizeable demonstrations in other locations were also reported later in the day, with calls for further rallies on Sunday.It is not immediately clear whether any demonstrators have been arrested.Last month's protests began over economic grievances and soon spread to become the largest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) said it had confirmed the killing of at least 6,159 people during that wave, including 5,804 protesters, 92 children and 214 people affiliated with the government. Hrana also said it was investigating 17,000 more reported deaths.Iranian authorities said late last month that more than 3,100 people had been killed - but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".Saturday's protests come as the Iranian authorities are preparing for a possible war with the US.The exiled opposition is adamantly calling on President Trump to make good on his threats and strike, hoping for a quick downfall of the current hardline government. But other opposition groups are opposed to outside intervention.The opposing sides have been involved in disinformation campaigns of social media, trying to maximise their conflicting narratives of what Iranian people want.Additional reporting by BBC Persian's Ghoncheh Habibiazad, and BBC Verify's Richard Irvine-Brown and Shayan Sardarizadeh.",

    "body": "5 hours agoDivya AryaBBC World ServiceBBCNisha Vaishnav has quickly excelled at football, rising to play for the Rajasthan state team in 2024One hot summer evening when Nisha Vaishnav was 14, she and her 18-year-old sister Munna were at football practice when they noticed five adult strangers taking photos of them.Nisha soon found out why they were there - the group were from the same family and included a couple looking for a wife for their son.Nisha's mother, who was also present, was keen to encourage the possibility of marriage. They all went back to the Vaishnavs' home in the village of Padampura, in the state of Rajasthan, north-western India.\"My mother asked me to touch their feet as a mark of respect,\" says Nisha. \"I refused.\"'Village women would point at us'While it is illegal for a girl under 18 or a boy under 21 to be married in India, in practice child marriage is still common.Around 25% of women living in India were married before they were of legal age, according to the children's charity Unicef. In Rajasthan, the rates of child marriage are higher than the national average and girls rarely feel able to refuse proposals or defy the wishes of their parents. Nisha was introduced in 2022 to football by Munna, who discovered the sport a year earlier through Football for Freedom - part of a state-wide non-profit organisation aimed at helping girls better their lives through sport.Munna had championed the project in her village, leading the battles for permission to travel to tournaments and wear shorts on the pitch rather than long tunics and loose trousers – a huge step in a village where married women cover their faces in the presence of men in public.\"For the first two to three days, village women would point to us and say, 'Look at those girls exposing their legs',\" says Munna. \"We ignored them, decided we didn't care, and continued wearing shorts.\"Munna has helped lead the battle in her village to play football in shorts and travel to tournamentsNisha quickly excelled at the game, rising to play for the Rajasthan state football team at the National Football Championship in 2024.She also cut her hair short - an act of defiance in a village where girls are expected to grow it long.When the marriage proposal from the family watching her at football practice came, Nisha pushed back. She made it clear she was too young to get married and wanted to continue to pursue her dreams in football.  After about a month, the other family retracted their offer.Nisha and Munna also resisted a joint marriage proposal from another family in 2025, involving both of them and their younger brother.When their father asked Nisha if she had a lover waiting for her at football practice, she says she replied: \"There is no lover. I am going to play football - that is my love.\"Finding employment through footballGirls who marry as children are at increased risk of sexual coercion, early pregnancy, malnutrition and poorer health, according to many studies.They are also more likely to leave education early, reducing their chances to improve their life circumstances.Padma Joshi, from Football for Freedom, which is part of the Mahila Jan Adhikar Samiti women's rights non-profit organisation, wants to educate families about these risks.She says Football for Freedom has trained about 800 girls across 13 villages in Rajasthan since it was formed in 2016.\"When we started talking to parents we never said that we were introducing football to stop child marriage,\" says Joshi.Joshi explains to parents that excelling at football could ultimately help their girls get jobs, as Indian states set aside some public sector roles for sportsmen and women.Laali Vaishnav, who was a child bride herself, says she worries her girls will be exposed to \"bad influences\"Poverty, as well as tradition, is among the reasons families in India continue to marry off their girls, who are often regarded as financial burdens.Nisha and Munna have an older sister who was married in 2020 at the age of 16, and their mother, Laali, was a child bride herself.Defending her decisions, Laali says villagers fear that unless their children are married young they'll be \"exposed to bad influences and run away with boys\".Asked if she knew that marrying her eldest daughter at 16 was illegal, she nods, explaining that no-one gets caught: \"We do it quietly, we don't print a wedding invitation or decorate the house or put up a tent.\"But the law is clear - facilitating child marriage is a crime. Adults who carry out ceremonies, along with parents or guardians who permit child marriage or negligently fail to stop it, can be imprisoned for up to two years and fined 100,000 rupees ($1,100; £950).If a child marriage isn't reported, it can later be registered when the man and woman are of legal age and no-one will be prosecuted.The number of cases of child marriage being reported across India has gradually been rising as awareness and enforcement have improved. There were 1,050 cases reported in 2021 compared to 395 in 2017, according to the Ministry of Women and Child Development.However, this is a tiny proportion of the estimated 1.5 million girls under the age of 18 who are married each year in India, according to Unicef.​​Nisha and Munna's team came first at the under-17s State level School Games, held in October 2025Nisha, who is now 15 and still at school, hopes to one day play football for India's national team.If she doesn't make it, securing a government job would allow her to become financially independent and have freedom.To qualify for one of the jobs set aside for sportsmen and women, she needs to keep playing at state level or better until after she finishes university.While Munna, who is now 19, managed to escape child marriage, the possibility of an arranged marriage being pushed for by her older sister's in-laws remains.She is resisting the proposal.Munna has not reached the same heights in football as Nisha, but helps train girls at the Football for Freedom Project and is studying for a degree at university.She hopes to become a sports teacher at a school.In the meantime, she counsels the girls she trains against child marriage.\"Whether I am able to stop their marriage or not, I want to help them become something in life, realise their dreams.\"",

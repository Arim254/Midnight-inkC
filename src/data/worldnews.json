    "body": "Trump's grand plan to reshape the world order leaves Europe with a difficult choice to make4 hours agoAllan LittleSenior correspondentBBCFor 80 years, what bound the United States to Europe was a shared commitment to defence and a common set of values: a commitment to defend democracy, human rights and the rule of law.That era was inaugurated in March 1947 in an 18-minute speech by President Harry Truman, in which he pledged US support to defend Europe against further expansion by the Soviet Union.America led the creation of Nato, the World Bank, the IMF and the United Nations. And it bound itself into what became known as the \"rules-based international order\", in which nation states committed to a series of mutual obligations and shared burdens, designed to defend the democratic world against hostile authoritarian powers.Now, the new US National Security Strategy (NSS), published in December, signals that, for the White House, that shared endeavour has ended; that much of what the world has taken for granted about America's role is over.The review refers to the \"so-called 'rules-based international order'\", putting the latter phrase in inverted commas: a kind of delegitimisation by punctuation mark.AFP via Getty ImagesJD Vance said that the real threat to Europe did not come from Russia but from within Vice-President JD Vance warned America's European allies that this was coming in a speech at the Munich Security Conference in February 2025.He told them bluntly that the real threat to Europe did not come from Russia but from within - from those censoring free speech, suppressing political opposition and therefore undermining European democracy. And he was damning about the \"leftist liberal network\".The French newspaper Le Monde said the speech was a declaration of \"ideological war\" against Europe.Last month's NSS codifies Vance's remarks, and, in black and white, elevates them to the status of doctrine.\"Certainly America is no longer the country that promoted the global values that have been in place since the end of the Second World War,\" says Karin von Hippel, who previously held senior positions in the US State Department and is a former Director of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), a Whitehall think tank.\"It is shifting to a very different place.\"So, if the world is indeed moving away from that order, what is it moving towards? And what does it mean for the rest of the world and in particular for Europe?'We have a different world today'\"International institutions, notably the United Nations, have been marked by dramatically anti-American sentiment, and have not served our or any other particular purpose,\" says Victoria Coates, a vice-president at The Heritage Foundation, a prominent right-wing think tank in Washington.In the eyes of Coates - who was previously the Deputy National Security Adviser to US President Donald Trump - change to the international order is inevitable in a changing world.\"The other issue we face here is that when that so-called rules-based international order was established after the Second World War, 80 short years ago, China wasn't a major concern.\"We just have a different world today.\"Getty ImagesPresident Truman watches on as a US representative signs the United Nations Charter in 1945This rules-based international order, built in the years after World War Two, was created by a generation that had come of age during an era of Great Power geopolitics, and had seen that system descend, twice, into catastrophic global conflict.That international order, flawed and incomplete though it undoubtedly was, was the legacy of that experience.But the NSS directly argues that American strategy went astray in the years since - and it blames what it calls \"American foreign policy elites\".\"They lashed American policy to a network of international institutions, some of which are driven by outright anti-Americanism and many by a transnationalism that explicitly seeks to dissolve individual state sovereignty,\" it says.It suggests that in future, the US will seek to roll back the influence of supranational bodies. Anadolu via Getty ImagesThe National Security Strategy says: 'We stand for the sovereign rights of nations, against the sovereignty-sapping incursions of the most intrusive transnational organizations'\"The world's fundamental political unit is and will remain the nation-state… We stand for the sovereign rights of nations, against the sovereignty-sapping incursions of the most intrusive transnational organizations…\"Elsewhere in the document, reflecting on the \"balance of power\", it states: \"The outsized influence of larger, richer, and stronger nations is a timeless truth of international relations.\"The Kremlin responded to the review with praise, saying much of it aligned with Moscow's own thinking.\"I think Trump, Xi, Putin and their more authoritarian acolytes are seeking to return us to an era of Great Power politics,\" says Field Marshal Lord Richards, who, as General Sir David Richards, was the head of the UK's armed forces from 2010 till 2013.Yet Sir Lawrence Freedman, Emeritus Professor of War Studies at King's College London, believes the new Security Strategy is not as radical a break with the past as it may appear.AFP via Getty ImagesThe Kremlin said much of the review aligned with Moscow's own thinking\"We need to be careful about the rules-based international order, which is a term that came into general use in the last decade or so,\" he argues.\"Look back and you find plenty of violations of the rules, Vietnam for example. So there's a sort of rosy glow about the past at times and everyone should be careful about nostalgia for what was a complex past.\"Muscular reassertion of the Monroe doctrineWashington's military operation in the Venezuelan capital Caracas that led to the capture of the country's leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, is an early example of this more muscular assertion of sovereign unilateralism.Some international law experts have questioned the legality of the Trump administration's actions, and argued the US may have violated international statutes governing the use of force. The US maintains its actions were legally justified.\"Under American law it certainly was [legal]\" Robert Wilkie, who served as an Undersecretary of Defense in the first Trump administration, has previously told the BBC.\"Maduro - most of our European partners have not recognised his regime so he is an illegitimate figure. Because of that he is stripped of the normal protections that heads of state would have [...]particularly when were are looking at constitutional provisions that exist in the United States, that would supersede anything the UN says.\"AFP via Getty ImagesThe military operation in the Venezuelan capital Caracas led to the capture of Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia FloresThe NSS claims, for the United States, the right to be the pre-eminent power in the Western Hemisphere, and to bend its Latin American and Caribbean neighbours into alignment with Washington's interests.This is a muscular reassertion of the 1823 Monroe Doctrine and its promise of US supremacy in the Western hemisphere.Colombia, Panama and Cuba are all also in the President's sights.\"This starts primarily with the Panama Canal,\" says Victoria Coates. \"The degree to which control of the canal is necessary to the United States cannot be overstated.\"China is now Latin America's biggest trading partner and a major infrastructure investor there. The NSS aims to roll back Chinese influence in Washington's backyard.When the canal was handed over to Panama, in 1999, by President George HW Bush, says Coates, \"we were in the assumption that China was a reasonable actor… That turned out not to be true…\"So making sure that the United States retains a prime position over the canal is critical, and I think Panama is for the first time getting that message from the United States.\"But Sir Lawrence Freedman is among those who argue that the US's ability to control its neighbours is not unlimited.\"The Strategy Review might say this is our hemisphere and we can do what we want, but there are still constraints. They may have extricated Maduro and his wife, but they're still dealing with the old regime.\"They're not running the country, despite what Trump says.\"Under the new strategy, the United States will no longer pressure authoritarian regimes to improve their human rights records.In a phrase taken from the US Declaration of Independence of 1776, the review declares, \"All nations are entitled by 'the laws of nature and nature's God' to a 'separate and equal station' with respect to one another.\"Getty ImagesXi Jinping and Nicolas Maduro pictured in 2015 in Beijing, ChinaIn the Middle East, for example, the US says it will abandon the \"misguided experiment with hectoring these nations - especially the Gulf monarchies - into abandoning their traditions and historic forms of government\".\"The key to successful relations with the Middle East,\" it adds, \"is accepting the region, its leaders, and its nations as they are while working together on areas of common interest.\"But it seems the same level of respect for traditions and historic forms of government is not extended to the democratic and allied nations of Europe.Whilst it refers to an American sentimental attachment to the European continent - and to Britain and Ireland - what's striking about this paper is that it seeks to redefine what is worth defending in the Western world.This review is civilisational in its reach, and argues for a civilisation that is no longer built on the shared values of the Truman Doctrine, but instead on the primacy of the sovereign nation-state.Where does this leave Europe?The review is damning about Europe's \"current trajectory\" and raises questions about whether some European nations can be regarded as dependable allies in the future.It talks about \"economic decline\" but adds that this is \"eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilizational erasure\".Elsewhere in the document, it states: \"It is more than plausible that within a few decades at the latest, certain Nato members will become majority non-European,\" which raises doubts about their viability as long-term security partners, the strategy suggests.\"It's a very nativist document,\" argues Karin von Hippel. \"It's very ideological. The underlying message is that the Christian white male is no longer running many of the countries [in the West] and we're seeing a threat to the dominance that the Christian white male has had in the United States and Europe.\"They're very careful not to say any of that explicitly but I think that's what's implied.\"Getty ImagesThe new US National Security Strategy, which was published in December, is damning about Europe's 'current trajectory'But Victoria Coates argues that, in her view, the \"larger struggle we find ourselves in\" is indeed civilisational.\"Sovereignty is also a critical issue,\" she says. \"Looking at the European Union project, especially after Brexit, I think a lot of countries are wondering if subverting the national interest to Brussels is a winning strategy.\"I do think that is one of the institutions that the NSS does call into question.\"This chimes with the interests of the American tech giants that oppose EU efforts to regulate their activities on the European continent.Last month Elon Musk posted on X that the European Union should be abolished and sovereignty returned to the individual nation states.'Cultivating resistance to Europe's trajectory'The review is clear about how Europe can regain its \"self-confidence\".It says: \"The growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism. Our goal should be to help Europe correct its current trajectory. We will need a strong Europe to help us successfully compete.\"And one of its policies for doing this is by \"cultivating resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations\".What is meant precisely by \"cultivating resistance\" raises many questions.In Europe, some have already concluded that the USA may no longer be a reliable ally, at a time when Russia poses a growing threat. After Vice-President Vance's speech in Munich, Germany's Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said Europe would need to \"achieve independence\" from America with a reshaped Nato.But this takes time.\"It's not achievable in the short term,\" says Sir Lawrence. \"The Europeans have become very dependent upon the United States, and this was a matter of choice: it was cheaper and simpler.\"Though in practice it would be desirable to be able to act without the Americans… in practice it's going to take years to disentangle ourselves. And it'll be extremely expensive.\"So Europe has a difficulty: it can't rely on the Americans, but it can't operate easily without them.\"AFP via Getty ImagesFriedrich Merz has said Europe would need to \"achieve independence\" As to the pressing question of what it means for Europe - and the EU - in the near future, Lord Richards issues a stark warning: \"[It] risks falling between the cracks.\"\"The EU cannot be a Great Power, nor can any of its constituent nations,\" he argues. \"[So] the UK/EU must decide under whose sphere of influence they should shelter?\"The answer is they are likely to remain in the USA's - and within a reshaped Nato.\"'A popular revolt against the establishment'But Lord Richards also believes that increased spending commitment is long overdue.\"European nations are going to have to spend much more on their own defence. This has long been coming but in the UK it is not yet translating into any fresh money. Indeed this year the armed forces are being required to save money rather than spend more.\"The US has been pushing Europe to increase defence spending for years, notes Sir Lawrence.\"The message that Europe needs to do more for its own defence has been around a long time. It was pushed by both Obama and Biden.\"Last year Trump secured from the European allies a commitment to increase defence spending to 5% of GDP - and in doing so may have done Europe a security favour, by pushing it, in the long term, towards greater operational independence from Washington.\"Spending has gone up quite significantly,\" says Sir Lawrence. \"The Germans have been making quite impressive strides. So there is movement, not as fast as many would wish, but it's happening.\"The review is clear about how America thinks it can \"help\" Europe. \"We want to work with aligned countries that want to restore their former greatness,\" it says.Getty ImagesVictoria Coates says: \"International institutions, notably the United Nations, have been marked by dramatically anti-American sentiment...\"Ultimately, what the report reveals is not so much an ideological divide that separates the US and Europe, but one that slices through both continents.Both sides of the Atlantic have certain concerns in common, argues Victor Mallet, a Paris-based journalist and author of a forthcoming book, Far Right France: Le Pen, Bardella and the Future of Europe.\"Concerns about immigration, concerns about the economy… and there's an extraordinary cultural gulf between supporters of people like Donald Trump, the National Rally in France, the AfD in Germany, and the intellectual, metropolitan, educated liberal elite.\"It's definitely a popular revolt against the establishment.\"He believes that one of the problems is inequality. \"America has, on average, the richest group of consumers the world has ever seen and yet many ordinary Americans find it hard to make ends meet and the same applies in Western Europe.\"More from InDepthIn the NSS, the US commits to scrapping certain practices, such as Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, that are derided by many in Trump's base.In this document, the culture wars that shape America's bitter public discourse now to a degree also shape its in foreign policy, and - by extension, affect the security of the Western world.Russia is not mentioned as a hostile power, despite its invasion of Ukraine, a Western ally. For in the culture wars, some in Trump's Maga base see in Vladimir Putin not a foe but a natural ally in the defence of white, Christian nationalist civilisation: a man who proudly defends his country, its traditions and identity - the very attributes, after all, that they value and admire in Donald Trump.Top picture credit: AFP / Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "35 minutes agoBethany BellBBC News, BerlinA 21-year-old man has gone on trial in Hamburg, charged with committing multiple crimes online, including coercing a 13-year-old to die by suicide on the internet.The man, who used the pseudonym White Tiger, is believed to have been a prominent figure in a group of international cyber-criminals known as \"764\".He is accused of grooming children and young teenagers between the ages of 11 and 15 to commit acts of violence against themselves online.The authorities say White Tiger's victims came from Germany, the UK, Canada and the US but his lawyer described the allegations are baseless and fabricated.The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) described the \"764\" group as an international child exploitation enterprise and a \"network of nihilistic violent extremists\". It also made a number of arrests.The man, named only as Shahriar J in line with German privacy laws, has both German and Iranian nationality. He was arrested at his parents' home in Hamburg last summer.He is charged with 204 offences against more than 30 children and teenagers.Prosecutors in Hamburg say the crimes were committed between 2021 and 2023.Shahriar J is suspected of having made particularly vulnerable children emotionally dependent on him via social media. He is then believed to have exploited that bond to create child pornography.In some of the cases, he is accused of persuading his victims to take their own life.Prosecutors have charged him with one murder and five attempted murders, \"as an indirect perpetrator.\" All his crimes are said to have been committed via the internet.Reports in the German media say one of his victims, a 13-year-old boy from the US, took his own life in real time online.A 14-year-old Canadian girl is alleged to have attempted to take her own life too.According to the charge sheet, in order to comply with Shahriar J's demands for increasingly violent content, the children seriously injured themselves or performed sexual acts on themselves in live chats in front of viewers.The defendant is accused of having made recordings of this in order to threaten the children with publication if they did not inflict even more serious self-harm on themselves in front of the camera.Because some of the alleged offences were committed when Shahriar J was a teenager himself, the trial is taking place behind closed doors.Before the trial began, the 21-year-old's defence lawyer, Christiane Yüksel, rejected the allegations as baseless and fabricated. She described the prosecution's claim of double indirect perpetration in the murder charge as \"experimental\".\"This construct of so-called indirect perpetration is, as the word suggests, a construct that is factually incorrect and cannot be proven,\" she said.",

    "body": "One of the co-owners of the Swiss bar where 40 people died in a fire on New Year's Eve has been detained.Swiss prosecutors said that Jacques Moretti, a French national, was a potential flight risk. The blaze at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana left 116 people injured. Many of the victims were aged under 20.It emerged this week that the bar in the ski resort had not undergone safety checks for five years.The decision to detain Jacques Moretti came after he and his French wife Jessica, who own the bar together, were on Friday questioned by prosecutors in the Swiss canton of Valais.Under Swiss law, the subject of an investigation is kept in custody until a court decision is made within 48 hours. The couple had been earlier placed under criminal investigation.They are both suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office in Valais said.The co-owners have said they are \"devastated\", pledging \"full co-operation\" with the ongoing investigation.The prosecutors have said they believe the fire started when people celebrating the New Year raised champagne bottles with sparklers attached, setting light to sound-insulating foam on the ceiling of the basement bar.On Friday, Switzerland staged a minute of silence on a national day of mourning for the victims of the fire. Church bells then rang across the country for five minutes.Trains and trams came to a halt and Zurich airport briefly paused operations.At a local commemoration staged in Crans-Montana, there was a standing ovation for firefighters.The news that the bar had not been inspected for five years has shocked families of the victims.Romain Jordan, who represents some of the families, said earlier this week the \"staggering number of breaches and shortcomings in the inspections raises the question of whether the municipality should be investigated with even greater urgency\".Venues like Le Constellation should have been checked annually, but Crans-Montana Mayor Nicolas Feraud said on Tuesday he could not explain why this had not been done for so long at that bar.\"We regret that - we owe it to the families and we will accept the responsibility,\" he said.He added that sparklers would be banned in local venues.Most of the victims of the fire were young - eight were under the age of 16.Many of the injured have severe burns and are being treated in Switzerland and other European countries.The funerals of some of those who died have been taking place.",

    "body": "US forces have seized a fifth tanker in the Caribbean Sea, officials said, as Washington continues its efforts to control exports of Venezuelan oil.\"Once again, our joint interagency forces sent a clear message this morning: 'there is no safe haven for criminals,'\" US Southern Command said on X.The X post on Friday morning said that Marines and sailors in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security \"apprehended\" the Olina oil tanker.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the Olina was \"another 'ghost fleet' tanker ship suspected of carrying embargoed oil\" and was seized after it \"departed Venezuela attempting to evade US forces\".  Noem posted a video online appearing to show troops dropping onto a ship from a helicopter. The tanker, the Olina, is on multiple countries' sanctions lists and the fifth vessel to be seized by the US in recent weeks.Maritime risk company Vanguard Tech said the vessel was attempting to break through the US naval blockade in the Caribbean. It added that the vessel's location tracker was last active 52 days ago, northeast of Curacao, and that \"the seizure follows a prolonged pursuit of tankers linked to sanctioned Venezuelan oil shipments in the region\".Earlier this week, the US said it seized two other tankers linked to Venezuelan oil exports in \"back-to-back\" operations in the North Atlantic and Caribbean.One of them was the Russian-flagged Marinera, which was seized with the help of the UK Royal Navy, who gave logistical support by air and sea.The Marinera is allegedly part of shadow fleet carrying oil for Venezuela, Russia and Iran, breaking US sanctions.US authorities alleged the second tanker - the M/T Sophia - was \"conducting illicit activities\".The moves come as the US seeks to choke off most exports of Venezuelan crude oil, and just days after its special forces seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a lightning raid on his residence in Caracas.President Donald Trump  says Venezuela - which has the world's largest proven oil reserves - \"will be turning over\" up to 50 million barrels of oil worth some $2.8bn (£2.1bn) to the US.Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said that the oil would be sold \"in the marketplace at market rates\" and that the US would control how the proceeds were dispersed \"in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people\".",

    "body": "A mountain of rubbish collapsed at a landfill in the central Philippines on Thursday, killing a 22-year-old woman and leaving more than 30 people missing, authorities have said.Rescuers pulled 12 injured sanitation workers from debris at the Binaliw Landfill in Cebu City, who were later hospitalised.Many of the missing are believed to be workers at the landfill. The mayor of Cebu told news outlet ABS-CBN that it may be difficult to reach survivors because of the potential for further collapse. The cause of the collapse is still unclear, but Cebu City councillor Joel Garganera said it was likely the result of poor waste management practices. Some 300 people from various government agencies and civilian groups have been deployed to the privately-owned landfill. Several excavators, ambulances and fire trucks have also been seen on site.\"All response teams remain fully engaged in search and retrieval efforts to locate the remaining missing persons,\" Cebu Mayor Nestor Archival said in a Facebook post on Friday.\"This is not like other landslides that you can just excavate. If you pull from the top, the bottom is soft. Let's say there is a person there, when you get the debris, it might get worse,\" he said, ABS-CBN reported.Cebu City councillor Joel Garganera said the incident may have happened suddenly, but was likely a result of poor waste management practices.Operators had been cutting into the mountain, mining the soil, and then piling garbage to form another mountain of waste, Garganera told local newspaper The Freeman.\"It's not a sanitary landfill. It's already an open dumpsite,\" he said.Families are waiting for updates on their loved ones trapped in the debris.One Binaliw resident, Belen Antigua, told Rappler that her son had survived the landslide but she was still waiting for her other relatives to be found. Another said that families had been gathered at the landfill to look for their children since Friday morning.\"I could not understand my emotions. They said those trapped are calling for help, so there is a possibility that my brother is still there,\" Michelle Lumapas, whose brother works at the landfill, told ABS-CBN.The Binaliw landfill is about 15 hectares (37 acres).Landfills are common in major Philippine cities like Cebu, which is the trading centre and transportation gateway of the Visayas, the archipelago nation's central islands.",

    "body": "Jose Mourinho took his players to stay at Benfica's training ground after they lost against Braga in the League Cup semi-finals - and the Portuguese manager said he hoped they \"don't sleep and instead think a lot\".Benfica lost Wednesday's tie 3-1 and ended the game with 10 men when former Manchester City defender Nicolas Otamendi was sent off.Mourinho, who was appointed manager in September, suggested his players would be staying at the club's training base in Seixal for the foreseeable future.\"The players will sleep in Seixal, and on Thursday there is training, and the day after there's training,\" Mourinho said at a news conference after the Braga defeat.\"Since there's no final on Saturday, our next game is against Porto next Wednesday. \"When we arrive in Seixal [on Wednesday], everyone will go to their rooms. I hope the players sleep as well as I do, which is to say that they don't sleep at all. \"That's what I wish for them. That they don't sleep and instead think a lot, like I'm going to think.\"Mourinho began his managerial career with Benfica in 2000 but took charge of only 10 games before leaving following a dispute with the club president.He has won 14 of his 23 matches in charge of Benfica in this stint and Wednesday's defeat halted an 11-game unbeaten streak.\"On Thursday we can start talking, which isn't what happened in the locker room,\" Mourinho said.\"In the locker room it was a monologue, and monologues don't work for me; I like to have a dialogue with the players. \"We'll talk about the differences between the first and second halves and prepare in the best way possible for the game against Porto.\"Benfica travel to Porto in the quarter-finals of the Portuguese Cup on Wednesday.Mourinho's side sit third in the Primeira Liga, 10 points adrift of leaders Porto.",

    "body": "Wawrinka handed Australian Open wildcard in final seasonImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Stan Wawrinka turned pro in 2002 and has won 16 tour-level trophiesByHarry PooleBBC Sport journalistUpdated 4 hours agoStan Wawrinka has been handed an Australian Open wildcard as he begins the final season of his career, with Australian Nick Kyrgios missing out.Three-time Grand Slam champion Wawrinka announced in December that 2026 will be the final season of his trophy-laden career.The 40-year-old former world number three won the first of his three major titles at Melbourne Park.\"Winning the Australian Open in 2014, my first Grand Slam title, is an absolute career highlight for me, so I'm incredibly grateful to receive this wildcard,\" said Wawrinka.\"To have the chance to play the Australian Open at the beginning of my final year on tour means the world to me.\"Wawrinka is currently ranked 156th in the world and won the most recent of his 16 titles in Geneva in 2017.'I'd rather give my spot to someone ready to make it count'Former Wimbledon finalist Kyrgios said he had chosen not to contest the men's singles competition at his home slam because he does not yet feel ready to play five-set matches.The 30-year-old, who has fallen to 670th in the world after struggling with injuries over recent seasons, will enter the men's doubles competition, having won that event in 2022 alongside compatriot Thanasi Kokkinakis.\"After some good conversations with Tennis Australia I've made the call to focus on doubles for this year's AO,\" Kyrgios wrote on social media.\"I'm fit and back on court, but five-setters are a different beast and I'm not quite ready to go the distance yet.\"This tournament means everything to me, but I'd rather give my spot to someone who's ready to make their moment count.\"It's all building blocks and I'll be back next year and pumped to compete. See you out there.\"Unfit Kyrgios gets organisers out of tight spot - analysisByBBC Sport tennis news reporterKyrgios not being fit enough to compete in five-set Grand Slam matches appears to have got tournament director Craig Tiley out of a tight spot.With three wildcard spaces left in the men's singles, somebody had to be left out of the equation and whatever Tiley decided would have been a contentious move.There is no doubt Wawrinka deserves the honour of a farewell appearance given what he has achieved in Melbourne and his career as a whole. The inclusion of the humble, hard-working veteran - and the opportunity to see one of the greatest single backhands in the game again on the biggest stage - will please many people.The divisive Kyrgios might be far from his peak but is undoubtedly still an attractive draw at Melbourne Park - as witnessed by the packed crowd which boisterously cheered him on against Britain's Jacob Fearnley last year.His recent performances showed he was physically short for top-level singles matches. In the much-maligned Battle of the Sexes he played at a pedestrian pace and looked troubled in a quick defeat on his ATP comeback in Brisbane. That paved the way for Jordan Thompson and Chris O'Connell to be awarded two of the spots - fulfilling the expectation of giving a leg-up to Australian players and boosting the home contingent - before Wawrinka was finally rewarded.",

    "body": "India has pushed back at US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's claims that the trade deal between the countries stalled because Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not call President Donald Trump.Trump imposed 50% tariffs on Indian goods in August, including a penalty for buying Russian oil, after the talks stalled.Both sides are now back to negotiating a deal but there is no clarity on when it will materialise and several informal deadlines have been missed.Key sticking points remain even now - including agriculture. Washington has been pushing for greater access to India's farm sector but Delhi has fiercely protected it. However, Lutnick suggested the deal was close to completion at the start.\"It was all set up. I said [to the Indian side] you got to have Modi call the president. They were uncomfortable doing it, so Modi didn't call,\" Lutnick said in a podcast released on Friday.The White House has not yet commented on Lutnick's assertions.India, however, said on Friday that the characterisation of the discussions between Delhi and Washington in the remarks made by Lutnick was \"not accurate\".\"India and the US were committed to negotiating a bilateral trade agreement as far back as 13 February last year. Since then both sides have held multiple rounds of negotiations to arrive at a balanced and mutually beneficial trade agreement. On several occasions, we have been close to a deal,\" foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters. He added that Modi and Trump had spoken on the phone eight times last year, covering \"covering different aspects of our wide-ranging partnership\".Speaking on the All-In Podcast, a business and technology show hosted by four venture capitalists, Lutnick said that Trump's philosophy of making deals was like a \"staircase\" - meaning the \"first stair gets the best deal\".He said that India was the second country to enter into negotiations with the US for a trade deal after the UK, and that Washington gave Delhi \"three Fridays\" to close the deal. His role, Lutnick said, was to negotiate the contracts and set up the whole deal but that Trump was the one who closed them - and that India's reluctance to set up the phone call meant the agreement ran into trouble.He added that after that, US closed a slew of deals with other countries, including Indonesia and Vietnam.He also said that when India got back later saying they were ready to take the initial deal, \"the train had left the station\".But the terms of the deal that Lutnick claims India missed are unclear. Agriculture, for instance, has been a key sticking point in the negotiations - Washington has been pushing for greater access to India's farm sector but Delhi has fiercely protected it. In December, United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told senators in Washington that the US had received the \"best ever offer\" from India. He also called India a \"tough nut to crack\".Trump has also made several comments about India and Modi in recent days, including warning of an increase in tariffs if Delhi does not stop buying Russian oil.India ramped up its purchase of cheaper oil from Moscow after the Ukraine war. Delhi had defended its decision saying that it needed to think about the energy needs of its vast population.Since the tariffs kicked in, oil refiners in India have been cutting their purchases from Moscow, according to several reports.Lutnick's comments come two days after US Senator Lindsey Graham said that Trump had \"greenlit\" a punishing Russia sanctions bill that, if passed by Congress, would allow for even higher secondary tariffs and sanctions on countries doing business with Moscow.Jaiswal said on Friday that India was \"aware of the proposed bill\" and was \"closely following developments\", reiterating the country's stance on the energy needs of its population.Despite the 50% tariffs, India's good exports to the US jumped more than 22% in November from a year earlier.The tariffs and the accompanying rhetoric have put a strain on the relationship between India and the US. Modi, who has shared a warm relationship with Trump, was among the first world leaders to visit the White House after the president was sworn in.But since then, the relationship has gone downhill. Delhi has repeatedly denied claims by Trump that he brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after a four-day conflict in May. In June, India said that Modi had told Trump that Delhi would never accept third-party mediation with Pakistan on the issue of Kashmir.Since then, the two leaders have spoken on the phone a few times, including in September when Trump called to wish Modi on his birthday.",

    "body": "1 day agoDanny Aeberhard,Rachel HaganandMatt McGrath,environment correspondentUS President Donald Trump has withdrawn the US from dozens of international organisations, including many that work to combat climate change.Nearly half of the 66 affected bodies are UN-related, including the Framework Convention on Climate Change - a treaty that underpins all international efforts to combat global warming.Groups working on development, gender equality and conflict - areas the Trump administration had repeatedly dismissed as advancing \"globalist\" or \"woke\" agendas  - are also included. The White House said the decision was taken because those entities \"no longer serve American interests\" and promote \"ineffective or hostile agendas\".The memorandum was signed on Wednesday following a review, with the White House describing the organisations as \"a waste of taxpayer dollars\".\"These withdrawals will end American taxpayer funding and involvement in entities that advance globalist agendas over US priorities,\" it said in a statement.It added that many of the organisations promoted \"radical climate policies, global governance and ideological programs that conflict with US sovereignty and economic strength\".As well as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the US has also withdrawn from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the world's leading authority on climate science that pulls together the most respected reports on the science of rising global temperatures.Sources within the organisation told the BBC that they were concerned about the potential impact of the Trump administration's withdrawal on US scientists involved in producing the body's next set of studies.The White House has already blocked US scientists attending a meeting in China.Any restrictions on travel or the participation of US researchers could significantly delay the release of the next set of IPCC reports, including potentially its mitigation report - a key document guiding governments on how to tackle climate change.Non-UN organisations affected by the US withdrawal include those focused on clean energy co-operation, democratic governance and international security, such as the International Solar Alliance, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance and the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum. Trump has already stripped many multilateral organisations he dislikes of funds and previously rejected the scientific consensus of man-made climate change as a \"hoax\".It will take a year for the US to be able to fully withdraw from the UNFCCC - but in reality the US ceased effective participation in the UN's climate change body long ago.It remains unclear whether the move will be challenged in the US courts, as many campaigners are now urging.While the US constitution allows presidents to join treaties \"provided two thirds of Senators present concur\", it does not specify what happens if they were to withdraw. As such, it is uncertain a future president could reverse Trump's decision and opt back in simply by applying.These latest withdrawals come after the president  took the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement for a second time last year, and declined to send a delegation to the COP30 climate summit in Brazil. The US has also already withdrawn from the World Health Organization, the UN Human Rights Council and the UN's cultural agency, Unesco.European leaders have criticised this latest decision, warning it would weaken global co-operation. EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said the UNFCCC \"underpins global climate action\" and called the US retreat \"regrettable and unfortunate\", while the EU's clean transition vice-president Teresa Ribera said the administration showed little concern for the environment, health or human suffering.A member of a US-based non-profit advocacy group, the Union of Concerned Scientists, described the step as a \"new low\".Senior policy director Rachel Cleetus told news agency AFP that it was another sign the administration, which she described as \"authoritarian\" and \"anti- science\", was determined to sacrifice people's wellbeing and destabilise global co-operation.",

    "body": "1 day agoTiffany WertheimerRenee Nicole GoodRenee Nicole Good was an award-winning poetThe woman shot dead by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis has been identified as Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three who had just moved to the city.She was a prize-winning poet and a hobby guitarist, who city leaders have said was there as a legal observer of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities.But the Trump administration has called her a \"domestic terrorist\".Good's death has sparked protests across the country, with many people holding signs that read \"Justice for Renee\".Her mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was \"probably terrified\" during the confrontation with officers that saw her fatally shot and that she was \"one of the kindest people I've ever known\".\"She was extremely compassionate,\" Ganger told the daily newspaper. \"She's taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.\"Her father, Tim Ganger, told the Washington Post that \"she had a good life, but a hard life\".A fundraiser for Good's family, which was set up with a target of $50,000 (£37,000), raised more than $1.4m a day after it was created.A US citizen, Good was originally from Colorado Springs.In what appears to be her Instagram account, which has now been made private, she  described herself as a \"poet and writer and wife and mom\", who was \"experiencing Minneapolis\".She had two children, who are now teenagers, with her first husband. Speaking to US media on condition that his name was not used, he said that Good was not an activist and that she was a devoted Christian who went to Northern Ireland on youth missions when she was younger.She hosted a podcast with her second husband, Tim Macklin, who died in 2023. They had a son together, who is now six years old, Macklin's father told the Minnesota Star Tribune. Her third marriage was to Rebecca Good, with whom she moved to Minneapolis just last year, from Kansas City, a neighbour told the Washington Post.Renee Good had previously worked as a dental assistant and at a credit union, but had mainly been a stay-at-home mum in recent years, according to the Associated Press.Getty ImagesPeople have left flowers, candles and messages at a make-shift memorial for Good in MinneapolisGood studied creative writing at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, and in 2020 she won an undergraduate prize from the Academy of American Poets for her piece entitled On Learning to Dissect Fetal Pigs.\"When she is not writing, reading, or talking about writing, she has movie marathons and makes messy art with her daughter and two sons,\" her biography from the prize reads, as quoted in US media. It seems to have now been removed.Good graduated the same year from the university's College of Arts and Letters with a degree in English.Its president said in a statement that her sudden death was \"yet another clear example that fear and violence have sadly become commonplace in our nation\".\"May Renee's life be a reminder of what unites us: freedom, love, and peace,\" Old Dominion University president Brian Hemphill wrote.Several state leaders have said that Good was at the scene of an ICE raid in the south of Minneapolis as a legal observer - a volunteer who monitors police and security forces at protests and operations. Good's mother told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was \"not part of anything\" that involved challenging ICE agents.But White House officials, including the president, have said Good was not simply observing, but also interfering in the officers' work.US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Good had been \"stalking and impeding their work\" all day by \"blocking them in\" with her car and \"shouting at them\".Good \"weaponised her vehicle\", Noem told reporters, and then tried to run over one of the officers \"in an attempt to kill or cause bodily harm to agents, an act of domestic terrorism\".The ICE agent feared for his life, Noem said, and \"fired defensive shots\".This account was backed up by Trump, who wrote on Truth Social that \"the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting\".He called her a \"professional agitator\" who \"violently, willfully, and viciously\" ran over an ICE officer.But the city's mayor said the agent who shot Good had acted recklessly.\"Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: that is bullshit,\" Jacob Frey said. \"This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.\"Good reportedly lived just a few blocks from where she was killed, and the scene is about one mile from where George Floyd was murdered in 2020 by a city police officer, sparking worldwide anti-racism protests.",

    "body": "Russia has used the Oreshnik ballistic missile as part of a massive overnight strike on Ukraine.Four people were killed and 25 others injured in Kyiv on Thursday night, where loud booms could be heard for several hours, setting the sky alight with explosions.It is only the second time that Moscow has used the Oreshnik, which was first deployed to hit the central city of Dnipro in November 2024.Russia's defence ministry said the strike was a response to a Ukrainian drone attack targeting Vladimir Putin's residence in late December, which Kyiv denies carrying out.While the ministry did not specify what had been the Oreshnik's target, shortly before midnight (22:00 GMT) videos began circulating on social media showing numerous explosions on the outskirts of the western city of Lviv.President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukrainian authorities confirmed that a ballistic missile had struck infrastructure in Lviv, about 60km (40 miles) from the Polish border.The Oreshnik is an intermediate-range, hypersonic ballistic missile, meaning it can potentially reach up to 5,500km (3,417 miles). It is thought to have a warhead that deliberately fragments during its final descent into several, independently targeted inert projectiles, causing distinctive repeated explosions moments apart.\"Such a strike close to EU and Nato border is a grave threat to the security on the European continent and a test for the transatlantic community,\" Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said. The strike was launched \"in response to [Putin's] own hallucinations,\" he added, referring to the alleged drone attack on the president's residence in December. The EU had immediately cast serious doubt on whether the drone strike ever happened, and last week Donald Trump said he did not think any such attack had taken place.On Friday EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Russia's Oreshnik strike was meant as a warning to Europe and the US. \"Putin doesn't want peace, Russia's reply to diplomacy is more missiles and destruction. This deadly pattern of recurring major Russian strikes will repeat itself until we help Ukraine break it,\" she wrote on X.Zelensky said in addition to the Oreshnik, 13 ballistic missiles targeted energy facilities and civilian infrastructure overnight, along with 22 cruise missiles and 242 drones.One damaged a building at the Qatari embassy, he added.He accused the attacks of aiming \"against the normal life of ordinary people\" during a cold spell and added everything possible was being done to restore heating and electricity.As Lviv and other western regions were targeted on Thursday night, more than a dozen missiles and hundreds of drones were deployed during the attack on Kyiv.A paramedic was among those killed while arriving at a damaged apartment in Kyiv. The capital's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, and Zelensky said it had been a \"double-tap\" hit - in which the first strike is followed by a second, killing rescuers who have arrived to help the injured.Two apartment buildings along the east bank of the Dnipro River and a high-rise building in the city's central district were also targeted.The morning after, as the clean-up got underway, the businesses that hadn't been damaged were open. A coffee shop just a few floors down from a destroyed apartment was serving customers. Wreckage from a Russian drone, including its wings and engine, were still scattered over the pavement outside.At another site, the round, charred entry hole of a missile was visible on the 11th floor of an apartment block in a quiet residential area.The power supply was disrupted in several of the city's neighbourhoods in the middle of a particularly harsh winter and as Kyiv braces for -15C (5F) temperatures this weekend.On Friday Klitschko urged Kyiv residents to leave temporarily if they were able to, and find warmth. \"Half of Kyiv's apartment buildings - nearly 6,000 - are currently without heat due to damage to the capital's critical infrastructure caused by a massive enemy attack,\" he wrote on social media.Kyiv's streets now relentless hum with the buzz of the diesel generators that businesses rely on for power, but many residential buildings are reliant on central heating and restoring it can be a longer task.The targeting of power plants has become a constant feature of this war, with Ukraine increasingly responding in kind to Russia's sustained attacks on energy infrastructure that regularly leave millions without access to electricity or heating.On Thursday night, as Moscow's attack on Ukraine was ongoing, half a million people in the Russian region of Belgorod were left without power following Ukrainian shelling of infrastructure, the local governor said. Authorities also said that a Ukrainian strike on a Russian power plant in the city of Oryol, further north, affected the water and heating systems. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoMakuochi Okafor,BBC Africa, LagosandJean OtalorUS President Donald Trump has warned that he could order more airstrikes on Nigeria if Christians continue to be killed in the West African nation.In a wide-ranging interview with the New York Times, Trump was asked whether the Christmas Day strikes in Nigeria's northern Sokoto state, targeting Islamist militants, were part of a broader military campaign.\"I'd love to make it a one-time strike. But if they continue to kill Christians it will be a many-time strike,\" he said.Nigeria's government has rejected Trump's earlier accusations that it is failing to protect Christians from jihadist attacks, saying that \"Muslims, Christians and those of no faith alike\" are targeted.Claims of a genocide against Nigeria's Christians began circulating last year in some right-wing US circles - but organisations monitoring political violence in Nigeria say most victims of the jihadist groups are Muslims.When questioned about this in the interview published on Thursday, Trump replied: \"I think that Muslims are being killed also in Nigeria. But it's mostly Christians.\"Nigeria's population of more than 230 million people is roughly evenly divided among Christians, who predominate in the south, and Muslims, who are mostly in the north.For the past 15 years, the north-east of the country has suffered from a devastating Islamist insurgency at the hands of jihadist groups such as Boko Haram and those affiliated with the Islamic State (IS) group, based in Borno state.The country also faces an array of other complex security issues in different regions, including criminal kidnapping gangs, clashes over land and separatist unrest.The US's Christmas Day strikes hit two camps run by a jihadist group called Lakurawa in the largely Muslim state of Sokoto, in north-western Nigeria near the border with Niger. It is still unclear if there were any casualties as neither the US nor Nigerian government has provided figures - and there has been no update on the outcome of the attack.Lakurawa established a foothold in the border region a few years ago and hails from areas north of Nigeria in the Sahel.The US and Nigerian government said after last month's airstrikes that the militants were linked to IS groups in the Sahel - although IS has not linked itself to any of the group's activities or announced ties to Lakurawa as it has done with other groups in the region that it backs.In the wake of the strikes, Nigeria's Foreign Minister Yusuf Maitama Tuggar told the BBC that it had been a \"joint operation\" and \"nothing to do with a particular religion\".Referring to the timing of the strikes, he said they did not have \"anything to do with Christmas\" - though Trump said he had ordered them as a \"Christmas present\".The foreign minister added that the strikes had had the explicit approval of Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu and the involvement of the country's armed forces.",

    "body": "1 hour agoLiv McMahonandLaura Cress,Technology reportersGetty ImagesThe UK government says Elon Musk's platform X limiting Grok AI image edits to paid users is \"insulting\" to victims of misogyny and sexual violence.Speaking on Friday, Downing Street said the move \"simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service\".It follows significant backlash after Grok digitally undressed people without their consent when tagged underneath images posted on X - something it says it now can only do for those who pay a monthly fee.However, the AI tool can still edit images on X if accessed through other areas of the platform, such as via its in-built \"edit image\" function, or on its separate app and website.The BBC has approached X for comment.The prime minister's official spokesperson told reporters on Friday it showed X \"can move swiftly when it wants to do so\".They said it was \"abundantly clear that X needs to act and needs to act now\".\"It is time for X to grip this issue, if another media company had billboards in town centres showing unlawful images, it would act immediately to take them down or face public backlash,\" they added.The Liberal Democrats have called for access to X to be temporarily restricted in the UK while the social media site is investigated.\"Musk has thrown his toys out of the pram in protest at being held to account for the tsunami of abuse,\" said Professor Clare McGlynn, an expert in the legal regulation of pornography, sexual violence and online abuse.\"Instead of taking the responsible steps to ensure Grok could not be used for abusive purposes, it has withdrawn access for the vast majority of users.\"And Hannah Swirsky, head of policy at the Internet Watch Foundation, said it \"does not undo the harm which has been done\".\"We do not believe it is good enough to simply limit access to a tool which should never have had the capacity to create the kind of imagery we have seen in recent days,\" she said.The charity previously said its analysts had discovered \"criminal imagery\" of girls aged between 11 and 13 which \"appeared to have been created\" using Grok.\"Sitting and waiting for unsafe products to be abused before taking action is unacceptable,\" Swirsky said.'Subscribe to unlock'Grok is a free tool which users can tag directly in posts or replies under other users' posts to ask it for a particular response.But the feature has also allowed people to request it to edit images - and ask it to digitally strip people of most of their clothing.Grok has fulfilled many user requests asking it to edit images of women to show them in bikinis or little clothing - something those subject to such requests have told the BBC left them feeling \"humiliated\" and \"dehumanised\".However as of Friday morning, Grok has told users asking it to alter images uploaded to X that \"image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers\".It adds users \"can subscribe to unlock these features\".Some posts on the platform seen by BBC News suggest only those with a blue tick \"verified\" mark - exclusive to X's paid subscriber tier - were able to successfully request image edits to Grok.Dr Daisy Dixon, a lecturer in philosophy at Cardiff University and female X user who said she had seen an increase in people using Grok to undress her, welcomed the change but said it felt \"like a sticking plaster\".\"Grok needs to be totally redesigned and have built-in ethical guardrails to prevent this from ever happening again,\" she told the BBC.\"Elon Musk also needs to acknowledge this for what it is - yet another instance of gender-based violation.\"Charities campaigning to end violence towards women also criticised X over the move.\"To restrict access to paying subscribers is not only inadequate – it represents the monetisation of abuse,\" said Emma Pickering of Refuge. She said while limiting the feature to paid X users may reduce volume, abuse had \"simply been placed behind a paywall, allowing X to profit from harm\".Meanwhile Andrea Simon, director of the End Violence Against Women coalition, said \"we are not convinced that X will take action to identify and prevent this, given it has dragged its heels with tackling this abuse\".Prof McGlynn said X's response echoed its approach to pornographic Taylor Swift deepfakes on the platform last year - where it blocked searches for sexualised material generated of the popstar using a Grok AI video feature.\"He is doing this to stoke free speech arguments,\" she added.\"He will claim regulation is stifling people's use of this technology. But, all the regulation requires is that he takes necessary precautions to reduce harm.\"'Ofcom must restrict X'Ofcom said on Monday it had made \"urgent\" contact with X amid concerns raised about content generated with Grok and the company's compliance with UK laws.\"Based on their response we will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation,\" a spokesperson added.Ofcom's powers under the Online Safety Act include being able to seek a court order to prevent third parties from helping the Elon Musk-owned platform raise money or be accessed in the UK.Lib Dem frontbenchers Victoria Collins, Marie Goldman and Max Wilkinson have written to Ofcom boss Dame Melanie Dawes, asking her to take action.\"If any other platform were found to be facilitating the mass generation of sexual abuse imagery at this scale, it is difficult to believe it would be permitted to continue operating uninterrupted,\" they wrote.\"Ofcom must restrict access to X now while an investigation takes place.\"Downing Street reiterated the government's \"full support\" for regulator Ofcom to use all its powers – up to and including a ban.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer previously called images generated by Grok \"disgraceful\" and \"disgusting\".Meanwhile the Conservatives reiterated comments made following PMQs on Wednesday by a spokesperson for Kemi Badenoch, who called deepfake images  \"absolutely abhorrent\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoWill Grant,Central America correspondentandOlivia IrelandThe Venezuelan government has started releasing detainees considered political prisoners by human rights groups, in what officials described as a goodwill gesture.Spain's foreign ministry said five of its nationals had been released. Among them is prominent Venezuelan-Spanish rights activist, Rocío San Miguel, her family confirmed to US media.The move comes after the US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in a raid on the capital, Caracas, on Saturday, to face drug trafficking charges in New York.US President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social that the release of political prisoners - which has been a long-held US demand - was \"a very important and smart gesture\" from Venezuela.Trump added that Venezuela released the prisoners as a sign of \"seeking peace\" and as a result, he had cancelled a \"previously expected second wave of attacks\" on the country.Jorge Rodríguez, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly and the brother of its interim president Delcy Rodríguez, announced on state television that \"a significant number\" would be released immediately, without specifying the number or identity of prisoners being freed.Hundreds of political prisoners are detained in Venezuelan prisons, with only a handful thought to have been released so far. Jorge Rodríguez said the interim government was releasing them in the interest of \"national unity and peaceful coexistence\".Rocío San Miguel, a vocal critic of Maduro and a defence expert, was the first prisoner confirmed to be freed. Her family told the New York Times that she was taken to the Spanish embassy in Caracas.Arrested in 2024, she was accused of being involved in a plot to kill the then-president and faced charges of treason, conspiracy and terrorism. Her arrest shocked human rights activists and, because her whereabouts were unknown, was labelled as potential \"enforced disappearance\" by the UN Human Rights Office.Venezuelan human rights organisations - some of which have members or their founders in jail - welcomed the news with caution.Despite being a key lieutenant of Maduro, Delcy Rodríguez's interim administration has appeared willing to co-operate with the US since it took its leader and made sweeping declarations about the South American nation's future.Watch: BBC reports from outside Venezuela prison \"El Helicoide\" as detainees releasedAbout 50 to 80 prisoners are believed to be held at the notorious El Helicoide prison, which US President Donald Trump announced would be closed following Maduro's capture. The prison gained international notoriety for detaining alleged political opponents, with reports by human rights groups of torture including beatings and electrocution. The announcement also comes shortly after US President Donald Trump stated that he had \"given orders to close that prison,\" which had become one of the most notorious symbols of political repression in the country.Venezuelan human rights group Provea warned El Helicoide's anticipated closure should not deflect attention from the other detention sites still running across the country. Opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who has several close allies in prison, has repeatedly demanded releases. In a sit-down interview with the Fox News show Hannity, Trump said Machado was expected to come to the US \"next week sometime\". Machado told host Sean Hannity earlier in the week that she wanted to give the US president her Nobel Peace Prize. When asked by Hannity whether Trump would accept the offer, he said \"that would be a great honour\". Venezuela's opposition and human rights groups have said for years the government used detentions to stamp out dissent and silence critics. Since the widely disputed 2024 election, the opposition claimed legal proceedings against activists, journalists and political adversaries increased. Attorney General Tarek Saab and others in the government repeatedly denied Venezuela held political prisoners, arguing those detained were arrested for genuine crimes.

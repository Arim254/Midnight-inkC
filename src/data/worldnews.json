    "body": "3 hours agoJessica ParkerBerlinGetty ImagesA vast stockpile of potatoes is being given away for free in Germany, after a farm in Saxony benefited from a bumper harvest.Thousands of tasty tubers have been rolling into the country's capital, Berlin, since mid-January, with residents risking icy streets to bag their share.Dubbed \"the great potato rescue\" it is part of a plan to stop about 4 million kg (8.8 million lb) of surplus spuds from going to ruin. Food banks, schools and churches are among the beneficiaries, according to organisers.Germany is the European Union's potato-producing capital, and last year's harvest has left the market saturated.Ultimately it is about \"putting the potato in the spotlight as a valuable food,\" said Berliner Morgenpost editor, Peter Schink who helped spearhead the plan.The newspaper teamed up with eco-friendly search engine firm, Ecosia, to co-ordinate and fund the distribution of the spuds.Not wishing to discard its \"magnificent tubers\" back into the fields, Osterland Agrar says it's set to have bussed around 500,000kg to Berlin, and other parts of Germany and Ukraine.\"We can store them until the middle of this year,\" said Hans-Joachim von Massow, Managing Director of Osterland Agrar, the agricultural firm that ended up with all the potatoes.But not everyone is celebrating.\"Food is and will remain valuable, even if thoughtless do-gooders throw around free potatoes at schools and churches,\" said Timo Scheib from the Brandenburg Farmers' Association.The BBC skidded optimistically along to a pickup spot at the city's de-commissioned airfield, Tempelhofer Feld, but there were no veggie sacks to be seen.And when we sheepishly asked a local resident about whether she'd noticed any \"frei Kartoffeln\" in the area she seemed slightly mystified, if not a little concerned for me.Nevertheless, as potatoes took off out of Saxony, so has the story, receiving media coverage in Germany and beyond.However we are told by Schink that the influx is, as things stand, set to wind down in Berlin as the funding is drying up.One more truckload can be expected once the weather is warm enough.",

    "body": "1 hour agoDan JohnsonBBC correspondent, JerusalemReutersMost of Gaza has been reduced to rubble as a result of the warIsraeli media report that a senior security source has said the military accepts that more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed during the war in Gaza.Israel has previously cast doubt on figures from the Hamas-run health ministry.But their figures have been deemed reliable by the UN and other human rights groups and widely cited by international media.The war began after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,660 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It says at least 492 Palestinians have been killed since a ceasefire began on 10 October 2025. Four Israeli soldiers have also been killed.Israel has always disputed the Hamas figures and said before last year's ceasefire it had killed 1,600 fighters since 7 October 2023 and another 22,000 combatants in the war. Now a senior source has indicated to Israeli journalists, including those from Haaretz and the Times of Israel, that the total number given by the Hamas health ministry is largely accurate, even though they have not been able to break down how many were combatants and how many died as a direct result of the fighting.The Israel Defense Forces previously said it believed two or three civilians had been killed for every dead militant. The IDF said the latest reports did not represent its official position.",

    "body": "9 hours agoDearbail JordanandJemma Crew,Business reportersGetty ImagesDeutsche Bank's offices in Frankfurt and Berlin have been raided by officials as part of an inquiry into money laundering.In a statement, the Office of the Federal Prosecutor said it was conducting an investigation, involving the Federal Criminal Police Office, into \"unknown individuals and employees\" at Germany's largest bank.It said Deutsche Bank had \"maintained business relationships in the past with foreign companies\" which were suspected of \"having been used for money laundering purposes as part of further investigations\".A Deutsche Bank spokesperson confirmed to the BBC that searches had been carried out at its premises.Officials declined to comment on who, at the bank, or which foreign companies are being investigated.\"No further information can be provided regarding the background of the business relationships, the transactions processed through Deutsche Bank AG, their scope, or the companies themselves,\" the prosecutor's office said.German media reported that the case carries possible links to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, a claim his lawyers say is \"entirely false and inaccurate\".A legal representative for Abramovich told the BBC on Thursday he has \"no connection\" to the raids on Deutsche Bank and \"is neither under investigation nor suspected of any wrongdoing\".\"The searches conducted this week relate solely to Deutsche Bank's alleged failure to comply with statutory reporting obligations under Germany's anti-money laundering framework and have nothing to do with Mr Abramovich whose name was only used as a way to draw media attention to the investigation. \"This is unacceptable and Mr Abramovich reserves all his rights in the matter,\" they added.Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government and the European Union in March 2022, following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.The oligarch, who made his fortune in oil and gas, is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he denies.It is not the first time the bank's offices have been searched.That investigation looked into whether Deutsche Bank staff helped clients set up offshore accounts to \"transfer money from criminal activities\", and was focused on activities between 2013 and the start of 2018.

Russia received 38 bodies in return, Moscow's chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said.Medinsky posted a photo on Telegram apparently showing the exchange, with individuals dressed in biohazard suits standing next to a line of white refrigerated trucks used to transport bodies.Kyiv and Moscow have exchanged thousands of soldiers' bodies over the course of the almost four-year conflict. The latest exchange took place under an agreement reached by the two sides during negotiations in Istanbul in 2025.Under that deal, Moscow and Kyiv agreed to return the bodies of 12,000 soldiers, as well as all sick and heavily wounded prisoners of war and those aged under 25.Vladimir Medinsky/TelegramMoscow's chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky confirmed the exchange on Telegram The last swap took place in November last year when Russia returned 1,000 bodies to Ukraine and received 30 in return.There has not been an exchange of prisoners of war since October 2025, with both sides accusing the other of stalling.As the fourth anniversary of the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 inches closer, efforts at brokering a peace deal between the two countries continue.The negotiations were described by all sides as constructive, but key territorial issues remain unresolved, including Russia's demand that Ukraine give up the 25% of the Donetsk region still under its control.Despite the ongoing negotiations, both sides continue to exchange drone attacks. At least five people were killed in Ukraine's Kharkiv region on Tuesday after a Russian drone struck a passenger train. Russia has intensified its strikes on key infrastructure targets in recent months, leaving many people in Ukraine to face freezing temperatures without heating or power.More on this story",

    "body": "5 hours agoBrandon DrenonBBC NewsGetty ImagesDemocratic US Senator Amy Klobuchar has said she is running for governor in her home state of Minnesota amid the tumult of an ongoing immigration crackdown.In a video released on Thursday, she called for unity across all parties, billing herself as someone who could heal political divisions and was \"willing to find common ground\".Her candidacy comes after the incumbent governor, Tim Walz, announced he would end his re-election campaign early amid criticism of his handling of a fraud scandal in the state.Klobuchar, a four-term senator, reportedly delayed her announcement after federal agents fatally shot Alex Pretti on Saturday, two weeks after they also killed another US citizen, Renee Good.These killings and other altercations have put the tactics and use of force by federal agents under intense scrutiny.The operation has become controversial due to these and other violent episodes which have been filmed and shared widely on social media. US President Donald Trump recently pledged to \"de-escalate\" the operation.Klobuchar will be seen by many pundits as the frontrunner in November's governor contest, as the best-known Democratic figure to declare their candidacy ahead of the primary elections. Republicans, meanwhile, have not won a statewide race since 2006. One Republican contender, Chris Madel, ended his own bid for state governor on Monday, citing the immigration enforcement in his state as an \"unmitigated disaster\". Referring to recent turmoil in her state, Klobuchar said in her video: \"We cannot sugarcoat how hard this is. But in these moments of enormous difficulty, we find strength in our Minnesota values of hard work, freedom, and simple decency and goodwill.\" Klobuchar also addressed other incidents of violence that have rocked her state in recent months, including the murder of a state lawmaker and her husband, and the deadly shooting of two children inside a church. Political observers suggested that the theme of her message was more centrist, compared with other Democratic candidates who have taken a more combative stance against the Trump administration. Klobuchar did not mention President Donald Trump by name, but referred to the deployment of about 3,000 federal immigration agents \"on our streets and in our towns, sent by an administration that relishes division\". She also referenced the fraud scandal that led to Walz ending his campaign, saying: \"I will make sure the people who steal taxpayer money go to jail and root out the fraud.\"When announcing he would end his re-election bid, Walz said he would \"focus on the work\" of governor rather than a campaign. He has also said his government is taking measures to prevent future fraud.In her bio, Klobuchar describes herself as a veteran bipartisan lawmaker willing to work across the aisle. After being sworn into the Senate in her first term in 2007, Klobuchar has risen through the ranks and joined multiple committees, and had a stint as the chairwoman of the Senate Rules Committee.",

    "body": "4 hours agoHugh SchofieldParis correspondent, ParisAFP via Getty ImagesThe proposed bill was approved in the French National Assembly on WednesdayFrance is to enshrine in law the end of so-called \"conjugal rights\" – the notion that marriage means a duty to have sex.A bill approved on Wednesday in the National Assembly adds a clause to the country's civil code to make clear that \"community of living\" does not create an \"obligation for sexual relations\".The proposed law also makes it impossible to use lack of sexual relations as an argument in fault-based divorce.Though unlikely to have a major impact in the courts, supporters hope the law will help deter marital rape.\"By allowing such a right or duty to persist, we are collectively giving our approval to a system of domination and predation by husband on wife,\" said the bill's sponsor, Green MP Marie-Charlotte Garin.\"Marriage cannot be a bubble in which consent to sex is regarded as definitive and for life.\"The law will erase an ambiguity that has persisted despite there being no explicit mention of \"conjugal duty\" in any legal text.Currently, the French civil code defines the duties of marriage as \"respect, fidelity, support and assistance,\" and it says that couples commit themselves to a \"community of living\".Nowhere in the texts is there any mention of \"conjugal\" - ie sexual - rights. The origins of that notion lie in medieval church law.However judges in modern divorce suits have, from time to time, given a broad interpretation to the concept of \"community of living\" to include sexual relations.In a famous case in 2019 a woman was found to have withheld sex from her husband for several years, and he was then granted a \"fault-based\" divorce implying guilt on her part.But the woman then took her case to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which last year condemned France for allowing refusal of sex to be grounds for a fault-based divorce.This was hailed as an important advance by feminist campaigners.The ECHR's decision has made it, in practice, impossible for any French divorce judge to make a similar ruling - which is why the new law is mainly intended as a clarification, with the change unlikely to have a major impact on the courts.For campaigners, the notion that wives have a \"duty\" to agree to sex with their husbands is one that persists in parts of society and needs to be confronted.The Mazan trial of 2024 – where a drugged and unconscious Gisèle Pelicot was repeatedly raped by men invited by her husband - is seen as emblematic. Several defendants said they assumed her consent because of what her husband had told them.In France, as in most other countries, marital rape is now enshrined in law, where prior to 1990 men could argue that marriage implied consent.Since November last year the legal definition of rape in France has also been expanded to include the notion of non-consent.Previously, rape was defined as a sexual act carried out with \"violence, constraint, threat or surprise\". Now it is any act where there is no \"informed,  specific, anterior and revocable\" consent. Silence or an absence of reaction do not imply consent, the law says.If you have been affected by any issues raised in this article, please visit BBC Action Line",

In the coastal city of Figueira da Foz, a Ferris wheel overturned and several vehicles were hit when part of a roof was torn from a building.Portugal has been hit by a succession of storms in recent days, including one over the weekend in which a man died after his car was swept away in floods.Heavy rain and wind gusts of up to 150km (95 miles) per hour caused more than 3,000 weather-related incidents across the country, civil protection authorities said. Several people were struck by falling trees or debris. The strongest winds were recorded at the Monte Real air base in Leiria, where gusts of 178km were recorded before the monitoring equipment was destroyed. Officials said the location was likely the storm's entry point to mainland Portugal.More than 850,000 people lost power on Wednesday, according to electricity distributor E-Redes. EPAA ferris wheel was overturned and several vehicles were hit when part of a roof was torn from a buildingThe civil protection agency (ANEPC) reported that three people had died in the central district of Leiria - one of the worst affected areas.In Leira, one person was hit by a metal sheet, and another was trapped in the structure of a house, according to officials. Local media said a man in Vila Franca de Xira died when a tree struck his car, local media said. There were also reports of a death in the Marinha Grande area.Transport across Portugal has been severely disrupted, with roads - including the main motorway connecting Lisbon to the north - and railways blocked by debris.Ten coastal areas were placed under a red weather warning on Wednesday due to dangerous sea conditions, with waves forecast to reach up to 14m (45ft,11in), according to the Portuguese Institute of the Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA).The PSP (Public Security Police) urged people in Coimbra and Leira to stay inside, while Portugal's Secretary of State for Civil Protection said the country remained on maximum alert.Prime Minister Luis Montenegro expressed condolences to the victims' families. He said authorities were assessing the damage and would take \"whatever measures are necessary\".Meanwhile, Leiria's mayor, Goncalo Lopes, urged the government to declare a state of emergency.\"We have public spaces turned upside down,\" he told reporters. \"It's something that will require a very large recovery effort in the coming months. The impact is similar to what a bomb could mean in our city, with massive destruction.\"After crossing Portugal, Storm Kristin moved east into Spain - bringing with it snow, rain and strong winds. The storm caused widespread disruption across the country, with schools, roads and train lines closed and hundreds of thousands without power.In Andalusia, emergency services reported some 2,000 weather-related incidents.Spain's national weather agency, AEMET, warned of very strong winds in some areas, with gusts expected to reach hurricane force. A red weather alert has been issued for parts of Almeria in the south-east due to the strength of the wind.",

There has been no official statement from the military government.The gunfire and blasts began shortly after midnight, according to residents of a neighbourhood near the Diori Hamani International Airport, the AFP news agency reports. They said calm returned after two hours.The airport houses an air force base and is located about 10km (six miles) from the presidential palace. One local resident told the BBC that shots had been fired from outside the airport, targeting planes.Others described their fear as they heard the gunshots and explosions.“We didn't sleep last night,\" said one resident. \"Our room and the whole house was shaking from the gunshots and explosions,” she said.\"Yesterday was the first time I have ever heard gunfire,\" another woman said. \"We were so scared.\"Several unconfirmed reports said unknown assailants had thrown explosive devices towards the airport area before exchanging fire with security forces.According to the FlightRadar24 website, several flights bound for Niamey have been diverted.AFP reports there was a heavy security deployment around the airport on Thursday morning.Niger is led by Abdourahamane Tiani who seized power in a 2023 coup that ousted the country's elected civilian president.Like its neighbours Burkina Faso and Mali, the country has been fighting jihadists who have carried out deadly attacks across the region.Early on Thursday morning, supporters of the military government took to the streets of Niamey ⁠to show their support for the authorities.The country is a major producer of uranium.A huge uranium shipment destined for export has been stuck at the airport amid unresolved legal and diplomatic complications with France after the military government nationalised the country's uranium mines.\"The situation is under control. There is no need to worry,\" the Anadolu news agency quoted a foreign affairs ministry official as saying, without elaborating.The official told the agency they were trying to determine whether the gunfire was linked to the uranium shipment.Additional reporting by Chris EwokorMore about Niger from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

The company was not explicit about the reasons behind the move.The film, Melania, is not promoted on the websites of the country's main cinema chains. One Cape Town independent cinema contacted by the BBC said that it was called by Filmfinity and told not to list it.Relations between the US and South Africa have seriously deteriorated over the past year.Amazon has reportedly paid $35m (£25m) to market the film which follows Melania Trump in the 20 days leading up to her husband's second inauguration on 20 January last year.It is also believed that Amazon paid around $40m for the rights to the film.\"Based on recent developments, we've taken the decision to not go ahead with a theatrical release in territory,\" Filmfinity's Thobashan Govindarajulu is quoted as saying by the New York Times.He told News24 that the decision had been taken \"given the current climate\".The executive did not elaborate on what was he meant by \"recent developments\" or \"current climate\".Attempts by the BBC to get comment from Filmfinity, which describes itself as the leading film distributor in southern Africa, have so far been unsuccessful. But contacting the independent Labia cinema in Cape Town, the BBC was told that it was called by Filmfinity who said that the film would not be playing.Show times for Melania are not listed on the websites of South Africa's two main cinema chains, Ster Kinekor and Nu Metro.Since Donald Trump came to power a year ago, US relations with South Africa have slumped. The president has also imposed high tariffs on South African goods and cut aid programmes.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "3 days agoMerlyn Thomas,BBC VerifyandShayan Sardarizadeh,BBC VerifyVerifying Iran footage as internet blackout continuesVerified videos emerging from Iran show bodies piled up in a hospital, snipers stationed on buildings and CCTV cameras being destroyed, following the unprecedented crackdown on protests earlier this month.BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they first erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the state's deadly crackdown on protesters.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has confirmed the killing of nearly 6,000 people, including 5,633 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December. It says it is also currently investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks.Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people were killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".The latest videos to emerge from the country are understood to have been filmed on 8 and 9 January, when thousands of people took to the streets following a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah.They are thought to be the deadliest nights for protesters so far and these newly verified videos show how Iran's security forces have been violently cracking down on protesters.Multiple clips analysed by BBC Verify and BBC Persian show bodies piled up inside a mortuary at Tehranpars hospital in east Tehran. We verified the location of the hospital by matching its interior to other publicly available images and videos of the building, and counted at least 31 bodies in just one video. Another clip shows seven body bags laid on the ground outside the hospital's entrance.Hundreds of people are seen protesting on a highway in west Tehran in another video before multiple rounds of gunfire can be heard and people begin to scream. Protesters have also been seen trying to evade Iran's heavy surveillance infrastructure by disabling CCTV cameras. Footage we verified shows one person in the capital climbing up a post and hitting a surveillance camera several times in an attempt to disable it. A huge crowd of protesters can be seen on the ground and heard cheering as the camera is damaged.We have tracked the spread of the anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely far higher.In the south-eastern city of Kerman a video taken from high up in a building shows several armed men in military uniform walking down a road firing their weapons continuously, though it is not clear who they are shooting at. A small fire burns in the middle of the road while the sound of protesters chanting can be heard in the background.Snipers have also been recorded on the roofs of buildings. In the north-eastern city of Mashhad verified video shows two men dressed in black on a rooftop of a building in daylight. One man is standing next to a large rifle that is leant against a wall and speaking on the phone. The other man crouches on the floor while smoking.For most people there has been an almost-total internet blackout since 8 January, but some have managed to briefly access the internet using methods such as SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet and virtual private networks (VPNs).More videos are likely to emerge in the coming days as the country's economy has struggled during the blackout.Additional reporting BBC Persian.",

    "body": "14 hours agoKoh EweandJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent in BangkokCCTVDozens of members of the Ming mafia were sentenced in 2025China has executed 11 members of a notorious mafia family that ran scam centres in Myanmar along its north-eastern border, state media report.The Ming family members were sentenced in September for various crimes including homicide, illegal detention, fraud and operating gambling dens by a court in China's Zhejiang province.The Mings were one of many clans that ran the town of Laukkaing, transforming an impoverished backwater town into a flashy hub of casinos and red-light districts.Their scam empire came crashing down in 2023, when they were detained and handed over to China by ethnic militias that had taken control of Laukkaing during an escalation in their conflict with Myanmar's army.With these executions Beijing is sending a message of deterrence to would-be scammers. But the business has now moved to Myanmar's border with Thailand, and to Cambodia and Laos, where China has much less influence.Hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked to run online scams in Myanmar and elsewhere in South East Asia, according to estimates by the UN. Among them are thousands of Chinese people, and their victims who they swindle billions of dollars from are mainly Chinese too.  Frustrated by the Myanmar military's refusal to stop the scam business, from which it was almost certainly profiting, Beijing tacitly backed an offensive by an ethnic insurgent alliance in Shan State in late 2023. The alliance captured significant territory from the military and overran Laukkaing, a key border town.Who are the Ming family?The eleven members of the Ming family are the first of the Myanmar scam bosses to be executed by China. But they will not be the last. Five members of the Bai family were also sentenced to death in November, and the trials of two other groups of defendants from the Wei and the Liu families have not yet concluded.The Ming family's trial was held behind closed doors, although more than 160 people were allowed to attend their sentencing hearing last year, including families of victims.The Ming mafia's scam operations and gambling dens brought in more than 10bn yuan ($1.4bn; £1bn) between 2015 and 2023, according to China's highest court, which rejected their appeals in November. Their crimes resulted in the deaths of 14 Chinese citizens and injuries to many others, the court said.More than 20 others from the Ming family were given jail sentences in September ranging from five years to life. Ming Xuechang, the clan's patriarch, killed himself in 2023 while trying to avoid detention, Myanmar's military had said back then.The Mings were among a handful of Godfather-esque families who rose to power in Laukkaing in the early 2000s. This was after the town's then warlord was ousted in a military operation led by Min Aung Hlaing, who became the leader of Myanmar's military government after the 2021 coup. The head of the family, Ming Xuechang, ran one of the most infamous of Laukkaing's scam centres, Crouching Tiger Villa.At first gambling and prostitution were the main sources of income for these families, but they eventually started online fraud, staffed mostly by people who were kidnapped and forced to run these scams.  Within the walls of the sprawling, well-guarded compounds was a culture of violence. Beatings and torture were routine, according to testimonies collected from freed workers. ",

    "body": "Talks ramp up to avert US government shutdown after Minneapolis shooting9 hours agoBernd Debusmann JrWhite House reporter Getty ImagesDemocrats are pushing to remove funding for the DHS from a spending bill unless additional oversight is added.Talks to avert a US government shutdown have intensified in Washington DC, with officials reportedly moving towards an agreement in negotiations over the Trump administration's immigration enforcement operation.Democrats have been pushing to remove funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from a $1.2tn (£870bn) government spending package following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday. US media report that the White House and Senate Democratic leadership are nearing an agreement which would meet Democratic demands to introduce new restrictions on federal immigration agents.It would mean five of the six spending bills could be passed before the Friday deadline, while the DHS one would get a short-term extension to allow time for more discussion on the proposed new restrictions, like around the use of masks by agents.If no deal is struck, the second shutdown within months will begin at one minute after midnight on Friday 30 January. How likely is a government shutdown? The spending bill has already passed in the House of Representatives, but needs 60 Senate votes to advance. Among the changes Democrats are seeking are requirements that federal agents obtain warrants before making arrests and clearer rules governing how they identify themselves, according to US media reports.There are only 53 Republican senators in the 100-member body, meaning that passing the bill will require at least some support from Democratic members. Earlier this week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: \"I will vote no on any legislation that funds ICE until it is reined in and overhauled, and Senate Democrats are overwhelmingly united on this issue.\" Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune has said that \"productive\" negotiations are ongoing.If changes are made, the bill will need to be re-approved by the House, which is currently on recess. On Wednesday, some Senate Democrats escalated their demands, expressly calling for DHS Secretary Kristi Noem's removal, and structural changes to both Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and US Border Patrol. \"This madness,\" Schumer said, \"this terror must stop.\" Some Republicans pushed back, with Texas's John Cornyn saying that \"any changes must not come at the expense of shutting down the government\".Bloomberg via Getty ImagesAverting a shutdown will require Republicans and Democrats to come to an agreementWhat is a 'partial shutdown' and who could be impacted? The entirety of the US federal government will not be impacted by a shutdown if it does occur this weekend. Already, legislation has been passed to fund dozens of agencies through the end of the 2026 fiscal year, which ends on 30 September. Those agencies - including the justice department, FBI and Department of Veterans Affairs - will not be impacted. But other branches are included in the same spending bill as DHS, including the defence department, health and human services, the treasury and the federal court system. In practice, that could mean that a prolonged shutdown could see court operations, medical research disrupted or labour statistics delayed. The Internal Revenue Service is also among the agencies that would be impacted, meaning that tax processing - including refunds - could be affected. DHS is also a sprawling department encompassing multiple agencies, including ICE, the Coast Guard, Secret Service and Customs and Border Protection. Employees that are \"essential\" to the functioning of impacted agencies would continue to work, but will not be paid until funding is restored - unless the government finds other sources - as Trump did with military personnel last year. How long was the last shutdown? The most recent shutdown in the latter half of 2025 lasted 43 days between 1 October and 12 November, making it the longest in US history. Democrats had initially refused to support the funding bill, demanding that Republicans agree to extend health insurance subsidies for low-income Americans that are set to expire at the end of the year.Eventually, eight Democrats broke with their party colleagues and helped pass the bill. That shutdown left around 1.4 million federal employees on unpaid leave or working without pay. Food aid was also left in limbo, and air travel was severely disrupted across the US. There have been a total of 16 government shutdowns since 1981, although some only lasted days. ",

    "body": "4 hours agoLucy ManningSpecial correspondentWatch: Sasha Troufanov told the BBC the return of Ran Gvlili's body was a 'big relief'A former Israeli hostage who was held for nearly 500 days in Gaza says the return of the body of the final hostage this week means all the released captives can \"now breathe and start our lives again\".Thirty-year-old Sasha Troufanov, an Amazon electronics engineer, was taken hostage on 7 October 2023 by Palestinian Islamic Jihad gunmen. His fiancée Sapir Cohen, mother and grandmother were also kidnapped and taken to Gaza. The women were released after more than 50 days as hostages. He was freed a year ago, after 498 days in captivity.In his first international interview, Troufanov, on a visit to London, told BBC News that with the return on Monday of Ran Gvili's body meaning all the hostages were back \"it felt wonderful. We waited so long for this to happen. \"I was carrying this burden ever since I came back. It was like a weight on my shoulders that kept me from coming back to my life. Although we were released, we didn't really come out of Gaza because our friends and brothers were still there.\"But the moment was bittersweet for him as Monday was also the birthday of his father Vitaly. Troufanov only discovered his father had been murdered on 7 October on the day he was released in February 2025 and realised his dad wasn't there to meet him.Troufanov and Cohen had been visiting his family on Kibbutz Nir Oz near the border with Gaza when Palestinian gunmen stormed their homes. Cohen rolled herself up in blanket and hid under the bed but they were both captured. Troufanov was punched and also stabbed in the shoulder. \"I saw the terrorist with so much anger and hate in his face, holding his knife trying to stab me even more.\"As the attackers tried to take Troufanov off the kibbutz he managed to momentarily escape but when he gave up running they still shot him twice in each leg. \"I just felt the rush of pain going through my brain and I fell to the ground then one of the terrorists hit me with the rifle from the back of my head and split it open.\"When he arrived to Gaza, he says he was then beaten by civilians and thought \"this is the moment you're going to die\".While in Gaza, Troufanov received almost no medical treatment. He was taken once to a family home and once to a hospital where his broken leg was wrapped first with a wooden broom and then with part of a metal grill.Unlike many other hostages, he was held almost entirely in isolation. For only two  of the 498 days in captivity did Troufanov see another hostage.ReutersTroufanov was released in February 2025 after 498 days in captivityAt the start he was held above ground, for more than six weeks locked in a cage and given barely enough food to survive. Here, he says he experienced sexual harassment where one guard repeatedly tried to encourage him to do a sexual act on himself. He also says a hidden camera filmed him when he was allowed a shower once a week. \"I noticed it and I took the shower trying to avoid my private parts towards this angle, but I had to do it because I needed to shower.\"Taken underground to the tunnels, Troufanov says he was left for months alone, his captors only bringing food then leaving him in a silent, cramped, humid space so dark he couldn't see his hand in front of his face.\"I remember feeling that I am buried underneath the ground while I am still alive. I was losing it. I was having a hard time to find hope in this place. Many times I lost hope completely. I said to myself: 'This is the last place you will see alive.'\"It is the first time since 2014 that there are no Israeli hostages held in Gaza. Two hundred and fifty-one people were taken captive during the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,660 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Since the ceasefire began on 10 October 2025, at least 492 Palestinians have been killed, the health ministry says, as well as four Israeli soldiers.Now all the hostages, those alive and those who were killed, have returned to Israel the second phase of US President Donald Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza can commence. The key Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza is set to open on an ongoing basis for the first time since May 2024, as required under the plan.It also envisages the full demilitarisation of Gaza, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups; a technocratic Palestinian government; and the reconstruction of Gaza.Sasha Troufanov believes that these measures aren't enough to ensure an attack like the one on 7 October won't happen again. \"Rebuilding Gaza, after what happened in the war, is understandable. But first of all we need to make sure that the people of Gaza will stop trying to hurt Israel. The terrorists were telling me: 'We will do this again and again.'\"Rebuilding Gaza and opening the Rafah crossing is in vain as it will never solve the real problem. We need to find a way to make this hatred and encouragement of terrorist activity stop.\"The former hostage now has to rehabilitate mentally and physically. He is currently on crutches after surgery on his leg but hopes to dance at his wedding to Sapir Cohen in a few weeks. \"It's a victory: overcoming hate and fear and saying to ourselves: 'We will build life together and we will continue.'\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoIan AikmanandBen HattonABEDIN TAHERKENAREH/EPAThe European Union has added Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to its terrorist list in response to Tehran's deadly crackdown on protesters in recent weeks.\"Repression cannot go unanswered,\" the bloc's top diplomat Kaja Kallas said, adding the move will put the IRGC - a major military, economic and political force in Iran - on the same level as jihadist groups like al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group.Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the EU decision was a \"stunt\" and a \"major strategic mistake\".Human rights groups estimate thousands of protesters were killed by security forces, including the IRGC, during weeks of unrest in December and January.Speaking in Brussels on Thursday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot described it as \"the most violent repression in Iran's modern history\" and said there could be \"no impunity for the crimes committed\".France had previously been seen as hesitant to add the IRGC to the EU's terror list over fears this could put an end to all diplomatic ties with Iran. But it changed course on Wednesday, coming out strongly behind a push to blacklist the group, which was led by Italy.\"Any regime that kills thousands of its own people is working toward its own demise,\" Kaja Kallas said in a brief statement on social media.Kallas said she expected diplomatic channels to remain open with Iran, even after adding the IRGC to its list of groups involved in acts of terror.The EU has also placed new sanctions on six entities and 15 individuals in Iran, including its Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni, Prosecutor General Mohammad Movahedi Azad, and Iman Afshari, a presiding judge.\"They were all involved in the violent repression of peaceful protests and the arbitrary arrest of political activists and human rights defenders,\" the bloc said in a statement.Organisations on the EU's terrorist list are subject to sanctions including travel bans and asset freezes, with the aim of removing their support networks.Iran's most powerful armed force, the IRGC was set up shortly after the 1979 revolution to defend the country's Islamic system. It is estimated to have about 190,000 active personnel, with capabilities across land, air and sea, as well as overseeing Iran's strategic weapons.It exerts influence overseas by providing money, weapons, technology and advice to allied governments and armed groups, and also controls the paramilitary Basij Resistance Force inside Iran, which has hundreds of thousands of members and has been used to suppress dissent.Australia, Canada and the US have already classified the IRGC as a terror group but it has not been proscribed in the UK.On Wednesday, UK Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy condemned Iran's \"brutal oppression of peaceful protesters\" but said it was long-standing government policy \"not to comment on whether a specific organisation is being considered for proscription\".The EU's announcement comes after US President Donald Trump said a \"massive Armada\", was moving quickly towards Iran \"with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose\".Handout via ReutersTrump said the fleet was headed by the USS Abraham Lincoln (file image)The Iranian foreign minister said the country's armed forces were ready \"with their fingers on the trigger\" to \"immediately and powerfully respond\" to any aggression.Araghchi said that rather than working to avert \"all-out war in our region\" Europe is \"busy fanning the flames\". Trump's latest warning follows his promise that Washington would intervene to help those involved in the deadly crackdown on protesters earlier this month.An internet blackout imposed by Iran's authorities has made assessing the scale of the government's violence against protesters difficult.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) said it had confirmed the killing of more than 6,301 people, including 5,925 protesters, while another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), said the final toll could exceed 25,000.Iranian authorities have said more than 3,100 people had been killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".Most international news organisations, including the BBC, are barred from reporting inside Iran. But videos showing security forces firing live ammunition at crowds have been verified by the BBC.",

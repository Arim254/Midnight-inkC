    "body": "8 hours agoInaya MohmoodNurPhoto/GettyPolice said the woman repeatedly asked ChatGPT \"Can you die from mixing sleeping pills with alcohol?\"A 21-year-old woman in South Korea has been charged with the murders of two men, after investigators discovered she had repeatedly asked ChatGPT about the dangers of mixing drugs with alcohol.Police in Seoul say that through analysis of her mobile phone they found that the suspect, identified only by her surname Kim, had asked ChatGPT \"What happens if you take sleeping pills with alcohol?\", \"How many do you need to take for it to be dangerous?\", and \"Could it kill someone?\"Kim previously told police that she did mix prescribed sedatives containing benzodiazepines into the drinks but did not know the men would die.However a police investigator said she was \"fully aware that consuming alcohol together with drugs could result in death.\"Kim was initially arrested on 11 February on the lesser charge of inflicting bodily injury resulting in death after two men died and another was left unconscious after going to a motel with her.According to police, Kim's first alleged attack took place on 28 January when she entered a motel in Suyu-dong, Gangbuk-gu, with a man in his 20s, she left the motel alone two hours later and the man was found dead inside the room the following day.Using the same method, she allegedly killed another man in his 20s on 9 February after the two checked into a different motel in Gangbuk-gu together.However, officials said that the suspects first attempt at murder via drug misuse had occurred in December last year when she gave a drink mixed with sedatives to her partner at the time, in a cafe parking lot in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province, causing him to lose consciousness.According to police, after her first victim regained consciousness, Kim began to prepare her drinks with significantly higher doses of the drug.Police have said they plan to continue investigating whether there are additional victims beyond the three identified.More on this story",

    "body": "1 day agoJake Horton,Ghoncheh HabibiazadandSarah JalaliBBCCrowds of mourners appear to have been fired on by a security official at a cemetery in Iran.The incident happened in Abdanan, in west Iran, on Tuesday as people gathered to commemorate those killed during the government's brutal crackdown on protesters last month.Iranians usually hold commemoration ceremonies on the 40th day after someone dies. The events have been held in several cities across the country to mourn the thousands killed during the deadliest nights of protests on 8 and 9 January.Verified video also shows people shouting anti-government chants at events in Tehran, Mashhad and Abdanan on Tuesday as crowds gathered at cemeteries and in the streets for commemorations.State-organised ceremonies were broadcast on TV and attended by senior government and military officials where people were led by organisers to chant \"death to America\".BBC Verify and BBC Persian have verified footage of people chanting \"death to Khamenei\", referencing Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. An armoured vehicle is then seen driving past the crowd of mourners as an apparent security official opens fire. People are heard screaming and seen fleeing the area as two gunshots ring out.The person who appears to be in uniform is seen pointing the gun away from the camera when the first shot is fired, before pointing the gun towards the crowd when a second shot can be heard. A puff of smoke near the gun is visible after each shot.Another verified video from the cemetery shows smoke in the distance as people run away from the scene and several gunshots can be heard.State-run IRIB News claimed that the event was peaceful and reports of people injured or killed were not true.XA billboard in the background of one the videos shows a picture of Alireza Seydi, a teenager from Abdanan who was understood to have been killed during the protests in Tehran last month and appears to be one of those commemorated during the ceremony.Weeks of anti-government protests started in late December which began over the economy but rapidly escalated. It peaked on 8 and 9 January after Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late shah, called for nationwide protests to take place. Thousands of people were killed in one of the deadliest government crackdowns in recent years. BBC Verify previously reported that it had spread to more than 68 towns and cities across the country.Khamenei last month acknowledged that thousands had been killed during the protests and blamed the US for the deaths.Additional reporting by Daniele Palumbo and Shayan Sardarizadeh",

The 69-year-old was now at home and recovering from a stroke which had affected his speech, his wife Marina Adamovich said.Statkevich spent more than five years behind bars after receiving a 14-year sentence for organising what the authorities called \"mass riots\" in 2020-21. He had run unsuccessfully against Alexander Lukashenko in a 2010 presidential poll.More than 1,000 political prisoners remain in jail in Belarus, rights groups say.\"He is at home, recovering,\" Adamovich said on Thursday. \"I really hope that everything will be fine. The main problem at the moment is his speech. It's bad, it's difficult to have a conversation.\"Meanwhile, exiled Belarusian leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said she was relieved that Statkevich \"is free and able to hug his wife, who waited for him for so long\".\"I want to thank everyone who keeps fighting to release all political prisoners in Belarus. We must continue until every last one is free,\" she added in a post on X.They were jailed in 2020-21, when Lukashenko brutally stamped out protests after claiming victory in presidential elections that were widely condemned as rigged.Most agreed to be sent abroad into exile. Statkevich was the only one who refused to leave the country.In exchange for the prisoner release, the US pledged to relieve some sanctions on Belarusian airline Belavia, allowing it to buy parts for its aircraft.Belarus is a close ally of Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Lukashenko has been in power in Belarus since 1994, quashing all opposition.",

I'm not sure about the iguanas, where are we going with that one?\" she said during her cross to the breakfast television show Today on Wednesday, apparently in response to comments from the studio hosts.With glazed eyes she then stumbled through the rest of her sports report, mixing up her words as well as the UK and the US, while studio host Karl Stefanovic could be heard laughing in the background.\"Look the cold weather is a thing, right,\" Stevanovic said unprompted afterwards. \"You can't actually move your lips.\"Social media clips of her report prompted mixed reactions from Australians. \"Good on her, nothing wrong with this. You can tell she's having an absolute ball over there,\" said one person on X, while another commented: \"If it's not a health issue, she should be sacked on the spot - very unprofessional.\"Mason, a prominent sports reporter best known for her National Rugby League coverage, appeared again on the Today show on Thursday morning.After she delivered her live report, she told viewers she wanted to \"take a moment, if that's OK, just to apologise\" for her previous appearance.She thanked viewers for messages of concern and continued: \"I'm OK, probably just a little embarrassed. \"Look, I totally misjudged the situation, I shouldn't have had a drink, especially in these conditions, it's cold, we've got altitude, and not having had dinner probably didn't help as well. But I want to take full responsibility, it's not the standard I set myself.\"So in saying that, I'm genuinely really sorry and I'm thanking everyone for those messages I've received as well.\"The Today show host Jayne Azzopardi responded saying \"we know how hard you work, Danika\" while Stefanovic called her a \"legend\".",

    "body": "Do not give away Diego Garcia, Trump tells UK in fresh attack on Chagos deal11 hours agoJaroslav LukivGettyThe US had previously supported the UK's decision to proceed with the Chagos dealDonald Trump has thrown the UK's Chagos deal into doubt as he launched a stinging criticism of the plan that would see the UK hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and lease back a joint UK-US military base.The US president urged Sir Keir Starmer not to \"give away Diego Garcia\" - the largest island on the archipelago and home to the base. Trump said \"this land should not be taken away from the UK\" and if it did it would be \"a blight on our Great Ally\", in a post on social media. In response to Trump, the UK Foreign Office said the Chagos Islands deal was \"crucial to the security of the UK and our key allies, and to keeping the British people safe\".\"The agreement we have reached is the only way to guarantee the long-term future of this vital military base,\" it said in a statement.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously insisted the deal is necessary to protect the continued operation of the base, amid previous attempts from Mauritius to dispute the legality of British sovereignty over the islands.Diego Garcia is the largest island in the archipelago, and is used as a joint military base by the UK and US armed forces.Under the deal - which was announced last May - the UK will lease back Diego Garcia for a period of 99 years at an average cost of £101m a year. Trump's latest comments come ahead of talks between the US and Mauritius planned for next week.The US president's position on the issue has seen rapid U-turns in recent months - from describing the planned transfer as an \"act of great stupidity\" to saying the deal was the \"best\" the prime minister could make.UK ministers have previously said that the deal could not go ahead unless it had the support of the US.The bill, aimed at enshrining the agreement into UK law, has been delayed and there is no date set for the next stage. UK Minister Alex Davies-Jones said the bill would return to the House of Lords \"as soon as parliamentary time allows\".Posting on the Truth Social platform on Wednesday, Trump wrote: \"I have been telling Prime Minister Keir Starmer, of the United Kingdom, that Leases are no good when it comes to Countries, and that he is making a big mistake by entering a 100 Year Lease...\"The US president stressed that Diego Garcia was \"strategically located in the Indian Ocean\".\"Prime Minister Starmer is losing control of this important Island by claims of entities never known of before,\" he said. \"We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the U.K., but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them.\"And referring to ongoing US-Iran talks on Tehran's controversial nuclear programme, Trump said: \"Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia and the airfield located in Fairford in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime.\"The Republican president has repeatedly threatened to use military action against Iran over its deadly crackdown on anti-government protests and its nuclear activities. The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something that Tehran has always denied.Asked by the BBC about Trump's latest comments, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"The post should be taken as the policy of the Trump administration, it's coming straight from the horse's mouth.\"When you see it on Truth Social you know it's directly from President Trump, that's the beauty of this president in his transparency and relaying this administration's policies.\"Watch: BBC asks White House about Trump U-turn on Chagos Islands dealIn a statement, it said it \"supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago\".Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said: \"It's time Starmer finally saw sense, U-turned and scrapped this appalling deal altogether.\"Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"Trump's endless flip-flopping on the Chagos Islands shows why Starmer's approach is doomed to fail.\"Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said: \"Keir Starmer risks alienating our most important ally by giving away the Chagos Islands, the worst deal in British history.\"Earlier this week, four Chagos islanders - who are opposing the handover deal - landed on the Chagos Islands' remote atoll as part of a protest against the deal.They refused to leave it, despite a threat of eviction by a British maritime patrol.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Misley Mandarin - one of the Chagossians who had travelled to the islands - said they would have to \"drag me from my beach\".He said \"there's no reason\" for the deal \"because Mauritius never owned Chagos Islands in the first place\".\"Keir Starmer, you could be a hero right now - don't ratify that deal, cancel that deal and let Chagossians come back to their homeland as British,\" he added.The Chagos Islands – officially known as the British Indian Ocean Territory – are located about 5,799 miles (9,332km) south-east of the UK and about 1,250 miles north-east of Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean.The islands have been under British control since 1814 and were bought by the government for £3m, which led to the establishment of the islands as an overseas territory in 1965.But Mauritius has long argued that it was illegally forced to give the islands away as part of a deal to gain independence.In the late 1960s, Britain invited the US to build a military base on Diego Garcia, forcibly removing thousands of people from their homes in the process.Some of those Chagossians ended up in Mauritius and the Seychelles, but others settled in the UK, mostly in Crawley, West Sussex.",

    "body": "50 minutes agoAmy WalkerReutersThe UN estimates the cost of damage in Gaza at $70bnSeveral countries which have signed up to Donald Trump's Board of Peace have contributed more than $7bn (£5.2bn) towards a Gaza \"relief package\", the US president has said.Trump made the announcement during the first meeting of the organisation that many of US's Western allies have refused to join, fearing the body board originally meant to help end the war between Israel and Hamas may be intended to replace the UN.  The second phase of a US-brokered Gaza ceasefire plan includes the disarmament of Hamas and the reconstruction of Gaza.It \"looks like\" Hamas would disarm, Trump told participants. However, there are few signs of the Palestinian group disarming. Gazans say it is extending its control over the Strip. Speaking as the Board of Peace convened on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had \"agreed with our ally the US there will be no reconstruction of Gaza before the demilitarisation of Gaza\".The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 72,000 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.The enclave's economy is in ruins, with its buildings and infrastructure largely destroyed.The UN estimates the cost of damage at $70bn.Countries including the UK, Canada, France and Germany have refused to join the Board of Peace that came into being last month.In an effort to address concerns that the organisation was meant as a way of sidelining the UN, Trump told the board's first meeting in Washington that \"we're going to be working with the United Nations very closely, we're going to bring them back\".Gaza, the US president said, was \"no longer a hotbed of radicalism and terror\". \"And to end that, we have today, and I'm pleased to announce that Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, and Kuwait have all contributed more than $7bn toward the relief package\".\"Every dollar spent is an investment in stability,\" he said, adding that the UN would contribute $2bn for humanitarian assistance, while football body Fifa would raise $75m for soccer-related projects in the Strip.Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician who has been given the title of high representative for Gaza as part of the board, said the process of recruiting a new transitional Palestinian police force had begun and \"just in the first few hours we have 2,000 people who have applied\".",

    "body": "59 minutes agoBernd Debusmann JrWhite House reporter Getty ImagesTrump told the Board of Peace, Trump said that talks with Iran have been 'very good' but historically difficult. President Donald Trump says the world will find out \"over the next, probably, 10 days\" whether the US will reach a deal with Iran or take military action.At the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace in Washington DC, Trump said \"we have some work to do\" in coming to an agreement with the Islamic Republic about its nuclear programme, and that \"we may have to take it a step further\". In recent days, the US has surged military forces to the Middle East, while progress was also reported at talks between American and Iranian negotiators in Switzerland. Democratic lawmakers, and some Republicans, have voiced opposition to any potential military action in Iran without congressional approval.In his remarks, Trump noted that Special Envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who is also Trump's son-in-law, had \"some very good meetings\" with Iran. \"It's proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran,\" he said. \"Otherwise bad things happen.\" One day earlier, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt warned that Iran would be \"very wise\" to make a deal with the US, adding that Trump was still hoping for a diplomatic solution over Tehran's nuclear programme. When Trump first announced the Board of Peace, it was thought to be aimed at helping end the two-year war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and oversee reconstruction. But in the last month its mission has appeared to go beyond one conflict, with many wondering if the Trump-chaired board, made up of about two dozen countries, is meant to sideline the United Nations.US missile and aircraft struck three Iranian nuclear facilities in June last year, and the White House was reportedly discussing new attack options this week. American forces have been ramping up their presence in the region in recent weeks, including the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier.In previous military operations in the Middle East, the US used RAF Fairford, in Gloucestershire, and the UK overseas territory of Diego Garcia, in the Indian Ocean. Satellite images have also shown that Iran has reinforced military facilities, and the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei, has posted messages to social media threatening US forces. \"The US President constantly says that the US has sent a warship toward Iran. Of course, a warship is a dangerous piece of military hardware,\" one of Khamenei's posts read. \"However, more dangerous than that warship is the weapon that can send that warship to the bottom of the sea.\"Several members of US Congress have expressed opposition to any military action against Iran. California Democrat Ro Khanna and Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie have said they will try to force a vote on the matter next week, citing the 1973 War Powers Act. The act grants Congress the ability to check the president's power to commit the US to armed conflict.\"A war with Iran would be catastrophic,\" Khanna posted on social media. \"Iran is a complex society of 90 million people with significant air defences and military capabilities.\"He also said thousands of US troops in the region \"could be at risk of retaliation\".The chances of passage in both chambers of Congress are not strong.In January, Senate Republicans blocked a similar war powers resolution that would have required the Trump administration to obtain congressional approval before launching further military operations in Venezuela following the capture of Nicolas Maduro.",

    "body": "7 hours agoBrandon DrenonWatch: Eight of the nine missing skiers located deceased, officials sayRescue teams combing through the backcountry of California's Lake Tahoe region say they have found the bodies of eight skiers who went missing in an avalanche on Tuesday.The search for a final missing skier continues but that person is presumed dead, Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said at a news conference on Wednesday.Officials said one of the deceased was the spouse of someone on one of the search-and-rescue teams, making continued rescue efforts \"challenging emotionally\". Fifteen skiers were reported missing on Tuesday after a \"football-field\" sized avalanche came barrelling down in the Castle Peak area around 11:30 local time (19:30 GMT). Six have been rescued.Watch: California hit by heavy snow as avalanche leaves skiers missing\"I want to offer my condolences to the family in this very trying time,\" Placer County Sheriff Wayne Woo said on Wednesday.The bodies of the eight dead skiers were still trapped in the snow and could not yet be recovered due to \"pretty horrific\" conditions, officials said.Since the avalanche, another 3ft (90cm) of snow has fallen on the area, Tahoe National Forest supervisor Chris Feutrier said.\"The hazard remains high,\" he said.Once the bodies are recovered, they will be transported to the Placer County morgue.Families of the deceased have been notified. Authorities have not yet released any of their names.Officials say the victims are seven women and two men.Sugar Bowl Academy, a ski school in Placer County, California, said multiple members of its community had died in the avalanche. \"Emergency responders are still working to recover all of the victims and are not at this time sharing the personal details of the victims and the survivors out of respect for the families affected,\" the academy said. \"We are an incredibly close and connected community,\" executive director Stephen McMahon said. \"This tragedy has affected each and every one of us. The depth of support for the families whose lives have been changed forever reminds us of how special this community is.\"Sheriff Woo said the rescue operation was a joint effort involving two teams and roughly 50 crew members who had to traverse \"extreme weather conditions\" using specialised equipment.At 17:30 local time on Tuesday, search teams arrived to an area roughly two miles (3.2km) from where survivors were sheltering in make-shift tents, and had to ski in from there.Two of the six survivors had to be carried back and \"could not walk because of the injuries they sustained during the avalanche\", Sheriff Moon said. They were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.Among the survivors, one was a guide and five were clients of the Blackbird Mountain guided tour. The entire ski group consisted of a mix of 11 recreational skiers and four ski guides.The avalanche on Tuesday occurred as they were making their way back at the end of a three-day trip. California Governor Gavin Newsom's office said in a post on X that state authorities were \"co-ordinating an all-hands search-and-rescue effort\" with local emergency teams.Conditions on Wednesday remained dangerous, multiple officials said, with Woo describing the climate as \"treacherous\".\"Avoid the backcountry,\" he said. \"Please allow us to focus all of our resources on continuing to recover these bodies for the family and bring them home.\" The avalanche that trapped the skiers was rated as a D2.5 on a destructive potential scale of D1 to D5, according to the Sierra Avalanche Center, which would mean it was over half a mile in length and would have a deposit of around 6.5ft. The Boreal Mountain Ski Resort, which is near where the accident occurred, has reported over 30in of snowfall since Tuesday.The resort decided to close on Tuesday because of high winds and low visibility.The storm has also closed several highways, including Interstate 80 and Highway 50.",

The performance charted Lula's path from poverty as a shoeshine boy to eventually reaching the highest post in the country. Tiago Martins, a carnival parade designer at the school, called it a deeply personal story.\"The samba says it: there are children of the poor becoming doctors, and me, a child of the poor, becoming a carnival designer,\" he told Reuters. \"We wanted to tell the story of a man who did a lot for the poor and for Brazil.\"Getty ImagesMembers of Acadêmicos de Niterói perform However, the opposition criticised the decision to spotlight a sitting president as a sign of early campaigning ahead of the October elections, with Lula seeking a fourth term.Several lawsuits alleging that Lula could gain a political advantage from the tribute were filed but rejected by the courts, with opposition parties even requesting the parade to be blocked.Lula himself gave his blessing to the performance of Acadêmicos de Niterói and watched it with thousands of people from the stands in the city's giant Sambadrome arena.Getty ImagesBrazil's president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva watching the show from the standsAnother pointed political message during Acadêmicos de Niterói's performance was a display of former far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro as Bozo the Clown sitting behind bars.The ex-president's son Flávio Bolsonaro has vowed to appeal a decision by the electoral court after it rejected requests by two opposition parties to prevent the parade.Many on social media also took issue with a performance by dancers dressed as a traditional family preserved in a tin can titled \"preserved neoconservatives\" as mocking Christian values.Getty ImagesBolsonaro depicted as Bozo the Clown by Acadêmicos de NiteróiGetty ImagesRevellers of the Unidos do Viradouro samba school who took the crownDespite the controversy, the parade of giant lions, dancing books and rainbow coloured plumes still delighted the crowds.The performances are judged over 10 categories by a total of 40 judges, with the top 12 samba schools competing for the title.Getty ImagesA float of the Unidos do Viradouro samba schoolGetty ImagesDancing books, anyone?Getty ImagesA sea of green and yellow celebrates the colours of the Brazilian flagGetty ImagesColour, colour and more colour was the night's unofficial theme",

    "body": "9 hours agoAna FaguyGetty ImagesUS billionaire Les Wexner, who is alleged to have played a key role in helping Jeffrey Epstein build his wealth, has described himself as \"naive, foolish and gullible\" for trusting the late sex offender.In a statement to US lawmakers at the start of a closed-door deposition on Wednesday, the former CEO of Victoria's Secret lingerie brand accused Epstein of stealing \"vast sums\" of money from his family when working as his financial adviser.Wexner, who was testifying before a House committee as part of its probe into the Epstein case, has denied any wrongdoing.  He was described as a potential co-conspirator of Epstein's in a 2019 FBI document, but no charges were ever brought against him.Lawmakers accused the billionaire, who gave Epstein broad powers over his finances, of knowing about the other man's crimes but failing to stop them.Wexner had been called before the House of Representatives Oversight Committee to answer questions surrounding his relationship with Epstein in the wake of the release of thousands of documents related to the financier's wrongdoing.Members of the committee travelled to Wexner's home state of Ohio for the testimony. A spokesperson for the 88-year-old tycoon told the BBC: \"Mr Wexner honestly answered every question put to him today by the Committee. \"Mr Wexner reiterated that he has no knowledge of, and did not participate in, Epstein's illegal conduct. He stands by that fervently.\"Only Democratic lawmakers attended the deposition. No Republican lawmakers travelled for it, though some of their staff members did attend.The Democrats addressed reporters after the session.\"We should be very clear that there would be no Epstein island, there'd be no Epstein plane, there'd be no money to traffic women and girls, Mr Epstein would not be the wealthy man he was, without the support of Les Wexner,\" congressman Robert Garcia, of California, said. Watch: Watch: Democrats say Les Wexner provided \"financial support\" to Epstein following depositionAlthough Wexner gave his testimony behind closed doors, his opening statement was made public.In the statement, Wexner said his relationship with Epstein was limited, and denied any knowledge of the convicted sex offender's abuse.\"I was naive, foolish and gullible to put any trust in Jeffrey Epstein,\" he said. \"He was a conman. And while I was conned, I have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide.\"He said he was \"pleased to testify\" and wanted \"to set the record straight\". Wexner also said he had visited Epstein's private island for \"a few hours\" with his family.The pair's relationship dates back to the 1980s and Wexner has said he cut ties after Epstein was accused of sexually abusing children in Florida.Wexner has also said he later discovered Epstein \"had misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family\" - a statement he repeated in his opening remarks on Wednesday.The retail magnate was identified in a 2019 FBI document as a potential co-conspirator. A separate email also said there was \"limited evidence regarding his involvement\".Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche previously said Wexner's name \"appears in the files thousands of times\".Wexner's lawyers recently told the BBC: \"The Assistant US Attorney told Mr Wexner's legal counsel in 2019 that Mr Wexner was being viewed as source of information about Epstein and was not a target in any respect.\"Mr Wexner co-operated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again.\"",

    "body": "14 hours agoMax MatzaGetty ImagesThe White House has warned Iran would be \"very wise\" to make a deal with the US, amid reports that President Donald Trump is weighing fresh military action against the Islamic Republic.Press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a news briefing that Trump was still hoping for a diplomatic resolution over Tehran's nuclear programme. Her comments come as the US moves a second battleship into the region, and a day after progress was reported at US-Iran talks in Switzerland.US media reported on Wednesday that Trump had discussed attack options with advisers, and that a US strike could take place as early as Saturday. Last summer the US military launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities.Trump had not yet made a final decision about whether to attack and ongoing conversations were described as fluid, sources have told the BBC's US partner CBS News.Leavitt told reporters on Wednesday there were \"many reasons and arguments that one could make for a strike against Iran\".She referred to US strikes in June, adding: \"Iran would be very wise to make a deal with President Trump and with his administration.\"Although no breakthrough seemed to have emerged from Tuesday's indirect talks in Geneva, both sides indicated that there had been steps in the right direction.Iran said an understanding had been reached with the US on the main \"guiding principles\" that will frame efforts to resolve the dispute around Tehran's nuclear programme. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi added that work still needed to be done.The US said \"progress was made\" and Badr Albusaidi, the foreign minister of Oman, which is mediating the talks, said the negotiations \"concluded with good progress\" on common aims and technical issues.Asked about the Geneva negotiations, the White House press secretary said that Washington and Tehran were still \"far apart\" on some key issues.\"I think you heard from the administration and the state department yesterday that there was a little bit of progress made, but we're still very far apart on some issues,\" Leavitt said. \"I believe the Iranians are expected to come back to us with some more detail in the next couple of weeks, and so the president will continue to watch how this plays out.\"Leavitt declined to say whether Israel would be involved in the US decision.Earlier in the week, Iran said it had reached an understanding with the US on the main \"guiding principles\" to resolve their dispute over Tehran's nuclear programme.Iran has said it wants to focus discussions on its nuclear programme and the potential lifting of economic sanctions, while Washington indicated previously it wanted Iran's missile development to be part of any talks.The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something that Tehran has always denied.The US has been ramping up its military presence in the waters near Iran, and as satellite images show the Islamic Republic fortifying sensitive military sites.BBC Verify has confirmed the location of the US aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln - equipped with guided missile destroyers and dozens of fighter jets - near Iran.The US has also reportedly sent the USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, to the Middle East. It is expected to arrive in the region within the next three weeks.All US military forces deployed to the region were expected to be in place by mid-March, a US official and a senior military official told CBS.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei posted on X on Tuesday an AI-generated image of the Ford at the bottom of the ocean.\"The US President constantly says that the US has sent a warship toward Iran. Of course, a warship is a dangerous piece of military hardware,\" Khamenei's post said.\"However, more dangerous than that warship is the weapon that can send that warship to the bottom of the sea.\"Khamenei also accused the US of attempting to predetermine the outcome of negotiations and said that would be a \"wrong and foolish thing to do\".Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has responded to the US build up by launching a maritime drill in the Strait of Hormuz, located in the Gulf between Oman and Iran, on Monday.The Strait is considered a vital international waterway and oil export route from Gulf Arab states.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "11 hours agoJake Kwon,Seoul correspondentandKelly NgReutersYoon Suk Yeol's martial law order left South Korea more polarised than everYoon attempted to subvert the constitution by deploying military troops to seal off the National Assembly and ordering the arrest of politicians on 3 December 2024, a Seoul court ruled. His actions fundamentally damaged South Korea's democracy and deserves a harsh punishment, presiding judge Ji Gwi-yeon told the court. Though it was short-lived, Yoon's martial law order left the nation more polarised than ever, and those deep divisions were on full display as the sentencing took place.Huge crowds of Yoon's supporters gathered outside the court hours before the hearing, holding banners reading \"Yoon, again\". Many of them broke down in tears following the verdict.Also present were anti-Yoon protesters, rallying for him to be sentenced to death.Yoon himself showed no emotion as he learned of his fate. His lawyers alleged that the verdict was not backed by evidence and accused the judge of following a \"pre-written script\".If either side launches an appeal, the case will go up to the Supreme Court, which means it could be months before the verdict is finalised.Yoon shocked his nation on 3 December 2024 by declaring martial law on live television. He claimed it was to protect the country from \"anti-state\" forces that sympathised with North Korea, but it soon became clear he was driven by domestic troubles: the opposition which held a parliamentary majority left him a lame duck president, while his wife Kim Keon Hee was at the centre of various corruption allegations.What followed were months of political chaos, Yoon's impeachment, and a string of indictments against him and other top officials.Former prime minister Han Duck-soo was handed a 23-year jail term last month for his part in the insurrection, while ex-defence minister Kim Yong-hyun, who advised Yoon to impose martial law, was jailed for 30 years on Thursday.Former interior minister Lee Sang-min, former intelligence commander Roh Sang-won, and ex-police chief Cho Ji-ho were among the other officials jailed for what judges have described as \"an insurrection from the top\".AFP via Getty ImagesMany of Yoon's supporters broke down in tears following the verdictSecurity was tight outside the court on Thursday, with dozens of police buses forming a cordon to restrict public access. Some 1,000 officers were deployed for security operations, local media reported.Inside the court, judge Ji called Yoon the \"insurrectionist leader\", although the judging panel found insufficient evidence to rule that he'd planned the martial law order a year before his announcement.Yoon defended his actions throughout his trial, arguing that as president he had had the authority to declare martial law, sounding the alarm over opposition parties' obstruction of government.He maintained that the order was necessary \"to protect the freedom and sovereignty of the people and to preserve the nation and its constitution\".The ruling Democratic Party, which won the presidential election after Yoon's ouster, accused the court of \"undermining judicial justice\" by not sentencing Yoon to death. \"[Yoon] masterminded an insurrection that shook the very foundations of our nation,\" party leader Jung Chung-rae said.\"[Today's decision] is a clear regress from the people's revolution... The public will find it deeply unsatisfactory and unacceptable.\"South Korea has not executed anyone on death row since December 1997, so even a death penalty for Yoon would, in effect, be life imprisonment.Yoon is already serving jail time for abuse of power and obstructing his own arrest after the martial law order. He still faces three more related trials.Several former presidents before Yoon had also been convicted and jailed, but were pardoned after serving just two to five years in prison – and many expect the same for Yoon.Additional reporting by Leehyun Choi and Hosu Lee, in Seoul",

    "body": "8 hours agoNardine SaadReutersNancy Guthrie, the mother of US broadcast journalist Savannah Guthrie, was last seen on 31 January.US investigators have reportedly been in touch with Mexican authorities about the disappearance of American news anchor Savannah Guthrie's mother, as the search stretches into a third week.The sheriff's department in the US state of Arizona and FBI declined to confirm they had contacted authorities across the border to help trace Nancy Guthrie.But her family has contacted a Mexican non-profit that works to find missing people in the region.Investigators have been sifting through 40,000 leads since the 84-year-old was reported missing this month, but a breakthrough has eluded them despite emotional public appeals for help from her NBC presenter daughter.US news website TMZ reported on Wednesday that the FBI had contacted authorities in Mexico, believing it was possible Guthrie could have been taken across the border.ABC News cited law enforcement sources as saying the FBI had notified Mexican authorities of Guthrie's disappearance, although they had no evidence she had been taken across the border.'I just believe she's somewhere here locally', Pima County sheriff tells BBCA Mexican security official told the New York Times the FBI had contacted officials in the state of Sonora, which shares a border with Arizona, to investigate an alleged \"purchase\" in the case, although that potential lead had apparently fizzled.It is standard practice for federal investigators to talk with Mexican counterparts, especially in cases so close to the border, Fox News reports.The Searching Mothers of Sonora, a Mexican non-profit dedicated to finding missing people in that state, often in cases linked to drug cartels, confirmed to CBS, the BBC's US partner, that it had been asked by a Guthrie family member to help the search. There has been no suggestion from officials that Guthrie was abducted by narco-traffickers.Watch: Video shows masked person outside Nancy Guthrie's homeTMZ also said it had received a new ransom note via email demanding about $6m (£4.5m) in cryptocurrency.The outlet, which previously reported receiving another possible Guthrie ransom note, said it had forwarded the new email to the FBI.Guthrie was last seen at her Tucson, Arizona, home on 31 January when a family member dropped her off there after an evening at her daughter's house nearby.Investigators believe she was abducted in the early hours of 1 February.Officials say her family members have been ruled out as possible suspects.On Tuesday, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told the BBC that DNA evidence taken from a glove found near Guthrie's home had produced no matches in a FBI database.The glove had appeared to match ones worn by a masked man captured on surveillance footage on the night Guthrie vanished.Watch: 'It is never too late to do the right thing' Savannah Guthrie says in appeal to suspected abductorThe sheriff said he was confident they would find her, whether it took \"10 days, 10 months, or worse\".Nanos also said he believed Guthrie was being held somewhere close to her home.The sheriff also told the BBC's US partner CBS News on Wednesday that investigators had not ruled out a theory that an accomplice was also involved in the suspected abduction. Investigators are now using a device that might be able to detect Bluetooth signals coming from her pacemaker, law enforcement sources told CBS.The sources said the tool, called a \"signal sniffer\", was mounted on a helicopter.Guthrie's pacemaker was disconnected from her phone app on the night of her disappearance.",

    "body": "18 hours agoCherylann MollanMumbaiCherylann Mollan/BBCRouble Nagi won the Global Teacher Prize 2026 for her contribution to learning in IndiaA narrow lane in Mumbai city's upmarket Colaba area opens up to a patch of land filled with small concrete cubicles - nooks washermen use to clean and dry the city's laundry.Surrounding the area are shanties painted in bright hues - red, blue, green and yellow - which sit one on top of the other like puzzle blocks in a lopsided Tetris game. The settlement is largely inhabited by washermen and their families, many of whom live and work there.Tucked within the maze is a small learning centre offering free lessons in basic math and language skills, helping their children get a formal education for the first time, or return to it after dropping out from school.The centre is run by a non-profit founded by Rouble Nagi, a 45-year-old artist who for three decades has worked to bring education to some of the city's most marginalised communities.Cherylann Mollan/BBCThe learning centre in Colaba has murals about waste disposalEarlier this month, Nagi received the Global Teacher Prize, a $1m award launched by the Varkey Foundation in collaboration with Unesco to recognise teachers who have made exceptional contributions to the profession. Nagi was selected from among 5,000 nominations and applications from 139 countries, according to the Global Teacher Prize website. It said that Nagi, through her non-profit organisation - the Rouble Nagi Art Foundation (RNAF) - had established \"more than 800 learning centres across India in over 100 underserved communities and villages\".Nagi said her inspiration to take learning to the less-fortunate came about unexpectedly, about three decades ago, when a boy walked into one of her art workshops in Mumbai. She learnt that the child lived in a slum and could not afford to go to school.Nagi says that the conversation motivated her to visit the boy's slum community and she offered to spruce up the locality by decorating the walls with murals.\"Children began to gather where we were painting. So, I asked them if they'd like to hear a story. They all said 'yes',\" Nagi recounts.She said that's when she realised that children in poor communities wanted to learn and that she could spark their interest in education through art.Cherylann Mollan/BBCNagi's foundation paints educational murals on the walls of slum communitiesOver the years, Nagi and her team have set up learning centres in several cities across India, where teachers are encouraged to use art-based learning to simplify concepts. Volunteers are roped in to offer skill-based lessons and donations help children access books, bags and other school supplies.Nagi explains that not all of the centres are brick-and-mortar classrooms. Sometimes, classes are held in an open area in a slum with students seated on mats and carpets.\"Learning can happen anywhere. You just have to make it interesting,\" Nagi says.But running these centres is also challenging. Nagi says many of the children come from dysfunctional families and her teachers often have to double-up as their counsellors and protectors.\"If a child doesn't show up at one of our centres for a week, a volunteer visits their home to check on them,\" Nagi explains.She adds that she also holds regular sessions with parents to keep them interested in their child's learning. This has helped many of her students complete their schooling and even pursue a college education after leaving the centre, she says.Cherylann Mollan/BBCMayur runs his own art classes and also volunteers with RNAFOne former student, Mayur, now runs his own art classes and a small printing business. At weekends, he volunteers with Nagi's foundation, hoping to give other children from the community the same opportunities he received.\"When you work in areas like these [slums], you have to build relationships not just with the students but the entire community. Whether that's through monetary help, supplying provisions in difficult times or offering a listening ear to someone who's overwhelmed. If we earn the trust and support of the community, we can continue our good work,\" Nagi explains.She says she is also passionate about her foundation's 'Misaal' (meaning 'an example') project - which focuses on converting slums into \"open-air classrooms\" by painting educational murals on walls on topics ranging from science and hygiene to environmental awareness and social responsibility. Nagi says these murals spark curiosity among residents and, in the long run, can also help bring about a change in people's behaviour and attitudes.Cherylann Mollan/BBCKhushi (left) says she wants to become a teacher when she grows upWith the prize money, Nagi hopes to take her foundation's initiatives to more places in India, beginning with the federally-administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir, where she grew up and now wants to build a skill-cum-learning centre, complete with computers.Back in Colaba, huge murals and inspirational quotes cover the walls of shanties. The walls of the learning centre too are painted in bright colours and feature subjects ranging from plants to the animal kingdom.Seven-year-old Khushi, a student at the centre, says she enjoys coming to \"school\" and dreams of becoming a teacher. Her mother, a domestic worker, is currently the family's sole earner. Many of the other children come from similar economic backgrounds, but all nurture big ambitions for the future. And Nagi's schools hope to play a part in turning them into reality.",

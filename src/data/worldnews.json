    "body": "More than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israel's military campaign in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The death toll has continued to rise since a ceasefire took effect on 10 October, with Israel carrying out air strikes for what it says are violations of the truce - while bodies continue to be recovered from under the rubble.Among those reportedly killed in an Israeli drone strike on Saturday were two young brothers, Fadi and Juma Abu Assi, whose family said they had been gathering firewood when they were killed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC they had struck two suspects who had crossed the so-called yellow line.The line marks where the Israeli military agreed to withdraw to under a ceasefire brokered by the United States more than seven weeks ago.The boys who died have been described in media reports as an eight-year-old and his brother, aged 10 or 11.Relatives said the children had been looking for firewood east of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip when they were killed.Their funeral was held at Nasser Hospital on Saturday.Figures from the Gaza Ministry of Health (MoH) have been widely used throughout the war and are seen as reliable by the United Nations (UN) and international institutions. But Israel has consistently disputed data published by Gaza's authorities.International journalists, including the BBC, are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently, so are unable to verify figures from either side.Gaza's Health Ministry says the Palestinian toll is now 70,100 and that more than 350 of those deaths have happened since the 10 October ceasefire. The Israeli military launched its offensive on Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",

    "body": "Venezuela has accused US President Donald Trump of making a \"colonialist threat\" after he said the airspace around the country should be considered closed.  The country's foreign ministry called Trump's comments \"another extravagant, illegal and unjustified aggression against the Venezuelan people\".The US does not legally have the authority to close another country's airspace, but Trump's online post could lead to travel uncertainty and deter airlines from operating there. The US has been building its military presence in the Caribbean, which officials say is to combat drug smuggling. Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has dismissed US claims of drug trafficking as an attempt to oust him. In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: \"To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.\"The White House did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment. Trump's comments come days after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned airlines of \"heightened military activity in and around Venezuela\".In a statement on Saturday, Venezuela's foreign ministry said that the US had \"unilaterally suspended\" its weekly migrant repatriation flights.\"We call directly on the international community, the sovereign governments of the world, the UN, and the relevant multilateral organizations to firmly reject this immoral act of aggression,\" it said.Venezuela on Wednesday banned six major international airlines – Iberia, TAP Portugal, Gol, Latam, Avianca and Turkish Airlines – from landing there after they failed to meet a 48-hour deadline to resume flights.The US has deployed the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, and about 15,000 troops to within striking distance of Venezuela.It has insisted that the deployment – the largest by the US in the region since it invaded Panama in 1989 – is to combat drug trafficking.On Thursday, Trump warned that US efforts to halt Venezuelan drug trafficking \"by land\" would begin \"very soon\". US forces have carried out at least 21 strikes on boats they said were carrying drugs, killing more than 80 people. However, the US has not provided evidence that the boats carried drugs. The Venezuelan government believes the aim of the US action is to depose Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced by the Venezuelan opposition and many foreign nations as rigged.The US has also designated Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns – a group it alleges is headed by Maduro – as a foreign terrorist organisation.Labelling an organisation as a terrorist group gives US law enforcement and military agencies broader powers to target and dismantle it.Venezuela's foreign ministry has \"categorically, firmly, and absolutely rejected\" the designation.Venezuela's interior and justice minister Diosdado Cabello, who is alleged to be one of the high-ranking members of the cartel, has long called it an \"invention\".The US state department has insisted that the Cartel de los Soles not only exists, but that it has \"corrupted Venezuela's military, intelligence, legislature, and judiciary\".",

    "body": "Australian children's music group The Wiggles has issued a statement after two of its members were featured in a music video for a song that apparently alludes to drug use.In the since-deleted clip for musician Keli Holiday's new song, Ecstasy, Blue Wiggle Anthony Field and his nephew Dominic Field, who plays the Tree of Wisdom, could be seen dancing in the background.A spokesperson for The Wiggles said the group \"does not condone\" the use of drugs \"in any form\" and that the video had been created without the band's approval.The TikTok video was viewed more than 92,000 times before it was taken down, Australian media report.\"We understand that a video circulating on social media has caused concern for many parents and professionals, and we want to address that directly,\" the group said in a statement to The West Australian newspaper. \"The Wiggles do not support or condone the use of drugs in any form. The content being shared was not created or approved by us, and we have asked for it to be removed.\"While Keli Holiday is a friend of The Wiggles, the video and the music added to it were created independently and without our knowledge.\"The clip was filmed at the TikTok Awards earlier this month where members of the band appeared on stage with Holiday - whose real name is Adam Hyde - during his song Dancing2. Holiday shared the video on TikTok, with the caption \"The Wiggles get it\",  to promote his new single Ecstasy. The song's chorus lyrics are: \"Hey girl, come on dance with me. You and your pocket full of ecstasy.\"A spokesperson for The Wiggles told The West Australian newspaper that the band's performances at the awards had been \"family-friendly\" and that the video had been \"edited together separately and without our awareness\".Created in 1991 as part of a university assignment, The Wiggles has become an international phenomenon among young children. Anthony Fields is the only original member still with the group.Keli Holiday is the solo project of Hyde, who is also known for being one half of electronic dance duo Peking Duk.The BBC has contacted Holiday's management for comment.",

    "body": "6 hours agoDanny AeberhardandTom BennettUkrainian naval drones hit two oil tankers from Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\" as they travelled through the Black Sea, Ukrainian officials have said.Footage verified by the BBC shows waterborne drones speeding through the waves into the vessels, before detonating into a ball of flame, sending black smoke into the air.The targeted tankers were named by Turkish authorities as the Kairos and Virat, both flagged to Gambia. Both were hit off the Turkish coast on Friday, with the Virat reportedly struck again on Saturday. No casualties were reported. The attacks appear to be an escalation by Kyiv as it tries to hit Russia's oil revenues, which are critical for funding its war in Ukraine.The two ships are reportedly part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" - a term that refers to the hundreds of tankers used by Russia to bypass Western sanctions imposed after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.The shadow fleet is largely made up of aged tankers, many with obscure ownership or insurance.The Kairos was struck in the south-west area of the Black Sea and the Virat in a central area further east. Both are on a list of ships subject to sanctions, according to London Stock Exchange data.  Sources told BBC Ukrainian that Sea Baby drones were used in the attack - a type of naval drone produced by Ukraine's security services, known as the SBU.Turkish authorities said they had been assisting the vessels, and released footage showing two Turkish boats trying to extinguish the fire on the Kairos.The attacks are seen as a warning by Ukraine, suggesting that ships carrying Russian oil in the Black Sea face the risk of direct attack, not just Western sanctions.Separately, a major consortium transporting oil from the Caspian region said it had suspended loading in the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, after an attack by unmanned boats overnight.The Caspian Pipeline Consortium said the attack had caused significant damage to a mooring point. Russia and Kazakhstan are major stakeholders in the company, which is also part-owned by Western firms like Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Shell.Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that a delegation led by top security official Rustem Umerov was on its way to the US to continue talks on an agreement to end the war. Umerov is set to lead the Ukrainian delegation after the previous lead negotiator, Zelensky's influential chief of staff Andriy Yermak, resigned after anti-corruption detectives searched his apartment on Friday. The Ukrainian delegation is expected to meet American officials in Florida on Sunday. Steve Witkoff, US President Donald Trump's overseas envoy, will hold talks in Moscow next week.",

    "body": "Three days of mourning begin after Hong Kong's deadliest fire in decades16 hours agoTabby WilsonHong Kong officials mark beginning of official mourning period with moment of silenceHong Kong officials have held a moment of silence at the start of a three-day mourning period to remember those killed after the city's deadliest fire in nearly 80 years.At least 128 people are now known to have died in the fire, which engulfed seven tower blocks on Wednesday. A further 83 were injured and 150 remain unaccounted for.Eight people have been arrested on suspicion of corruption over the renovation works the blocks had been undergoing. Three others were detained earlier on manslaughter charges.The cause of the fire has yet to be determined, but officials have said it spread up and between the blocks rapidly because of flammable materials placed on their exterior.Saturday morning's ceremony was held outside government headquarters, and saw city leader John Lee joined by other Hong Kong officials to observe three minutes of silence.The flags of China and Hong Kong were flown at half mast. The government has also set up memorial points across the city, where the public can pay their respects and sign condolence books.Once the fire started, it spread quickly to seven of the eight towers in Wang Fuk Court, in Hong Kong's northerly suburban Tai Po distric.It then took more than 2,000 firefighters almost two days to bring the blaze under control.The cause of the fire remains unclear, though authorities have said that polystyrene placed on the outside of the windows and plastic netting around the scaffolding on the buildings facilitated its spread.The tower blocks were also covered in bamboo scaffolding, which is commonly used for construction and renovation work in Hong Kong. The fire has sparked a debate on whether it should still be used.ReutersOfficials have confirmed that an investigation will be taking place over the next few weeks, with police already gathering evidence from the scene.The fire has caused anger throughout Hong Kong - which is known for its high-rise buildings - as questions about who should be held accountable grow.Residents of Wang Fuk Court have reported broken fire alarms and negligence from the company carrying out the renovations on the Wang Fuk Court, while Hong Kong's fire service has said fire alarms in all eight blocks were not working effectively.The Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) said those arrested in the corruption probe on Friday included directors at an engineering company and scaffolding subcontractors.Hong Kong's Labour and Welfare Secretary, Chris Sun, told reporters that his department had made 16 checks on the works at Wang Fuk Court since July last year.The housing estate was built in 1983 and had provided 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census.",

    "body": "39 minutes agoJessica RawnsleyGetty ImagesSearch and rescue operations are ongoing across Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, with hundreds still missingTorrential rains have triggered floods and landslides across South East Asia, leaving hundreds dead and missing.Monsoon rain exacerbated by tropical storms caused some of the region's worst flooding in years, with millions affected in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.Intense rainfall began on the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Wednesday. \"During the flood, everything was gone,\" a resident of Bireuen in Sumatra's Aceh province told Reuters news agency. \"I wanted to save my clothes, but my house came down.\" With hundreds still missing, the death toll is likely to rise. Thousands remain stranded, some awaiting rescue on rooftops.As of Saturday more than 300 people had died in Indonesia and 160 in Thailand. There were also several deaths reported in Malaysia.Aerial footage shows severe flooding across southern Asia after torrential rainsAn exceptionally rare tropical cyclone, named Cyclone Senyar, caused catastrophic landslides and flooding in Indonesia, with homes swept away and thousands of buildings submerged.Indonesia's disaster agency said on Saturday that nearly 300 people were still missing after flooding devastated Sumatra.\"The current was very fast, in a matter of seconds it reached the streets, entered the houses,\" a resident in Aceh Province, Arini Amalia, told the BBC. She and her grandmother raced to a relative's house on higher terrain. On returning the following day to retrieve some belongings, she said the flood had completely swallowed the house: \"It's already sunk.\"After waters rapidly rose in West Sumatra and submerged his home, Meri Osman said he was \"swept away by the current\" and clung onto a clothesline until he was rescued.The bad weather has hampered rescue operations, and while tens of thousands of people have been evacuated, hundreds are still stranded, the Indonesian disaster agency said.Getty ImagesIn Indonesia hundreds are still missing after heavy rains wreaked havoc on the island of SumatraIn Thailand's southern Songkhla province, water rose 3m (10ft) and at least 145 people died in one of the worst floods in a decade.Across the 10 provinces hit by flooding, more than 160 people have been killed, the government said on Saturday. More than 3.8 million people have been affected.The city of Hat Yai experienced 335mm of rainfall in a single day, the heaviest in 300 years. As waters receded, officials recorded a sharp rise in the death toll. At one hospital in Hat Yai, employees were forced to move bodies to refrigerated trucks after the morgue became overwhelmed, news agency AFP reported.\"We were stuck in the water for seven days and no agency came to help,\" Hat Yai resident Thanita Khiawhom told BBC Thai.The government has promised relief measures, including compensation of up to two million baht ($62,000) for households that lost family members. Getty ImagesTens of thousands of people have taken refuge in shelters in ThailandIn neighbouring Malaysia, the death toll is far lower, but the damage is just as devastating.Flooding has wreaked havoc and left parts of northern Perlis state under water, with two people dead and tens of thousands forced into shelters.Elsewhere in Asia, Sri Lanka has been battered by Cyclone Ditwah, with more than 130 people are dead and some 170 missing, officials said.Sri Lanka is also grappling with one of its worst weather disasters in recent years, and the government has declared a state of emergency.More than 15,000 homes have been destroyed and some 78,000 people forced into temporary shelters, officials said. They added that about a third of the country was without electricity or running water.Meteorologists have said the extreme weather in southeast Asia may have been caused by the interaction of Typhoon Koto in the Philippines and the rare formation of Cyclone Senyar in the Malacca Strait.The region's annual monsoon season, typically between June and September, often brings heavy rain.Climate change has altered storm patterns, including the intensity and duration of the season, resulting in heavier rainfall, flash flooding and stronger winds.More on this story",

    "body": "Drinking is a way of life in Ireland. Can a warning label change that?3 hours agoBob HowardDublinNurPhoto via Getty ImagesJack likes a drink and a standard night out will probably involve several pints at his local.\"If you have three pints, that is easy, easy going,\" the 29-year-old says. \"Probably a heavy night, casually, would be like six-plus pints.\"Jack grew up in County Galway where, he says, young people often start drinking at 14 or 15, \"usually in a field with a horrendous can of cider\".\"And then, when you're 17, your dad brings you to a pub, buys you your pint of Guinness, and that's where it takes hold.\"Ireland has a complex relationship with drinking and many see alcohol and socialising as inextricably linked, part of the social fabric of everyday life.Pubs tend to be the focal point of communities where there's often live music, and many traditional songs celebrate or speak of the harms of having one too many. Huge brands such as Guinness and Jamesons are major exports.Since 2020 supermarkets and corner shops across the country have had to erect physical barriers between sections selling alcoholic drinks and general products, while some bottles and cans of alcohol now carry among the strongest warning labels anywhere in the world.First signed into Irish law in 2023, products with the new labels - which state drinking causes liver disease and is linked to fatal cancers - are already on sale in pubs and supermarkets across the country.But in a move condemned by public health advocates, the Irish government has delayed their compulsory introduction until 2028, blaming uncertainty with world trade - which some believe is the result of lobbying by the drinks industry.For its part, the industry body, Drinks Ireland, said it did look to the Irish government to give some \"breathing space\" on health warning labels and that it believes they should be agreed on an EU-wide level.Labels displaying the calorie content and alcohol quantity (in grams) for each product won't become mandatory until 2028It was when Jack moved to Dublin in 2015 to study journalism that he really got to know the capital's nightlife.\"Dublin's a great spot because it's always spontaneous drinking, and that's why it's famous,\" he says. \"It's very pub-centric, drink-heavy.\"A big weekend night out for Jack usually begins with pre-drinks at someone's house - perhaps a bottle of gin mixed with tonic shared between him and three friends - before going on to a club for shots.Yet even though he sometimes drinks a considerable amount, Jack, who works in advertising, says he knows his limits and feels healthy.\"I'm a pretty fit person, I ran a marathon a year ago,\" he says. \"I know my limits. As long as you know what your limits are, I think its fine, health-wise.\"Jack outside a bar on Drury Street in the centre of DublinThree-quarters of the population here drink and celebrations, from birthdays to weddings, often involve alcohol.Consumption has fallen by around a third over the past 25 years, according to figures from The Drinks Industry Group of Ireland (DIGI).Young people, on average, now start drinking at 17 - two years older than the average 20 years ago. But once they start, their consumption and binge drinking is among the highest in Europe.A report from public health advocacy group Alcohol Action Ireland found the proportion of 15-24-year-olds consuming alcohol had risen - from 66% in 2018, to 75% in 2024 - and that two out of three 15-24-year-olds regularly binge-drink.Campaigners believe Ireland's alcohol warning labels are making an incremental impact. But 23-year-old Amanda, who's seen the labels, isn't so sure.\"You look at it and you're like, 'Oh, I just drank that. Should I drink another one?'\"Amanda doesn't think people will pay much attention to the health warnings and reckons they might even make some more inclined to drink.\"I just don't think they care,\" she says.On a night out in Dublin Amanda says she will usually limit herself to a maximum of three drinks.\"I like to be in control of what I do when I'm out,\" she says. \"I don't really drink that much for letting loose.\"She's mindful of how young people are perceived on social media, and that influences her own drinking choices.\"I don't like taking photos with myself with a glass of wine or Guinness,\" she says. \"You don't want to be in compromising positions, you don't want people to have a negative image.\"Amanda has seen the new warning labels on alcohol - but isn't sure how effective they'll beTwenty-one-year-old Sean lives in the capital and likes to socialise with friends - some are drinkers, while others are not.Unlike in other parts of Europe, Sean says if you want to socialise in the evenings there aren't many options here, other than going to the pub.\"There's not much to do in Dublin after a certain time,\" Sean says. \"Six to seven or so the city kind of shuts down. At times you'd just be like, 'I'm really not in the humour to have a pint, but I want to sit somewhere and see my friends' - so you have to get a pint.\"He's seen the alcohol warning labels too, but isn't sure they will put him off drinking.\"Everyone kinda knows it's bad for you, but we do it anyway,\" he says.Cigarette warning labels are \"far more graphic\", Sean's friend Mark adds.Ireland was the front-runner in restricting smoking and since 2004 you can't smoke in the workplace or restaurants and bars.Sean (left) with friends Mark, Ted, Nikita, Darragh and James in a courtyard near Temple Bar, Dublin's nightlife hub Even before the introduction of the new warning labels, some young Irish people in their 20s have been finding they are better off without alcohol in their lives.Mark rarely drinks. It's \"one for my birthday, one for Christmas\", he says, in part because alcohol is expensive and it's cheaper to opt for something else.\"I don't really like the taste of it,\" the 21-year-old says. \"Guinness is probably the one I would have, but also the cost of it - I am saving so much money by just getting the Club Orange.\"Helen is 27 and when she was younger used to drink regularly. Although she hasn't given up alcohol completely, like Mark she says she can largely live without it.\"The last time I had a drink was February,\" Helen says. \"It just kind of dwindled off to this point where I'm more or less sober, but I just don't identify as that because I may have a drink again - or maybe I won't.\"Sam and Helen are good friends who encourage each other not to drinkHelen's friend Sam - who started drinking when he was \"16 or 17\" - has gone a step further.\"It was a bit of fun then [I] went to college and the drinking kind of took off,\" Sam, who's now 27, says. \"One day I just kind of realised it was going too far. My dad said to me, 'What are you doing with your life? You really need to pack it in.'\"In 2021 Sam signed up to a year-long no-beer course and then quit alcohol completely. He's not had a drink now in three years and has even given up playing the concertina in pubs because it was so ingrained to have a drink at a session. When he does go to a pub he'll opt for a zero-alcohol drink.But he says it sometimes seems difficult for people to accept he's teetotal.\"There's the odd person that you meet and you tell them you're not drinking and they kind of look at you sideways.\"Unlike Sam, Jack's not keen on zero-alcohol drinks, and thinks they're \"a waste of time, because it's the same price as a pint\".He's thought about giving up drinking, but his inner resolve never lasts long.\"Honestly, it's quite difficult to try and embark on the sober journey in Ireland - because it is intrinsically entwined into our culture,\" Jack says.\"I always kind of flirt with the idea of going totally sober - but then I instantly dissuade [myself] and have a pint.\"Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThe BBC asked the Irish government why it had postponed the compulsory introduction of the new alcohol warning labels until 2028. It said the decision to defer was made following concerns raised about the impact of their implementation in the current global trading environment.More weekend picks",

    "body": "Forgotten photos reveal women who powered India's freedom struggle  4 hours agoDinyar PatelHistorianAlkazi Collection of PhotographyLilavati Munshi, a Congress leader, standing defiantly outside a boycotted British store in Mumbai In India, a set of recently discovered photographs is drawing attention to the role of women in one of the country's biggest anti-colonial movements, known as the civil disobedience movement, led by Mahatma Gandhi in 1930-31. The images do not simply capture female participation. They are visual proof of how women commanded and dominated political activity, often relegating men to the sidelines.In April 1930, Gandhi concluded his pivotal salt march, breaking the British monopoly on salt production - a charged symbol of colonial misrule. Raising a handful of muddy salt from the sea, he declared himself to be \"shaking the foundations of the British Empire\". Afterwards, Gandhi presided over waves of civil disobedience protests, encouraging supporters of the Indian National Congress to manufacture contraband salt, boycott foreign goods, and face down phalanxes of lathi-wielding policemen. Just a few months before, the Congress had declared purna swaraj (complete independence) as its political objective for India.Historians have long recognised the civil disobedience movement as an important turning point in Indian politics. Alkazi Collection of PhotographyWomen and children carry seawater from a Mumbai beach to their homes to make contraband saltAlkazi Collection of PhotographyMembers of a women's volunteer force clash with British police officers in MumbaiFirst, women joined anti-colonial activities in greater numbers. When Gandhi began his salt march he forbade women from joining, but several female leaders eventually convinced him to accord them a greater role.Second, Congress leaders harnessed modern media technologies like radio, film, and photography, which helped their political struggle reach an international audience.About 20 years ago, one album of photographs from the movement appeared at a London auction. Tipped off by an antiquarian dealer in Mumbai (formerly Bombay), the Alkazi Foundation, a Delhi-based art collection, acquired the album.Small in size with a coal-gray cover, the album gave few clues about its provenance.Scrawled on its spine were the words \"Collections of Photographs of Old Congress Party- K. L. Nursey.\"No one knew the identity of KL Nursey. Typewritten photo captions were brief and rife with spelling and factual errors. The album remained undisturbed in the Alkazi Foundation's collections until its curator and two historians from Duke University began to reexamine it in 2019.They were shocked by what they found.Despite their unknown origins, the photographs of the Nursey album told a dramatic and detailed story.Pictured here were the streets of Bombay, tense and bristling with thousands of volunteers aligned with the Congress. Unlike earlier photographs of political activity in India, these are not posed-for images: they capture violent confrontations with police, wounded volunteers loaded onto ambulances, boisterous marches amidst monsoonal downpours, and endless streams of protesting men and women through Bombay's Indo-Gothic streetscape. There is an electric energy running through the black-and-white images.The Alkazi Collection of PhotographyA boycott procession led by women winds its way through a Bombay marketAlkazi Collection of PhotographyWomen gather on the shores of Bombay's Chowpatty Beach, ready to make contraband saltAbove all, the album brings to light, perhaps better than any other source, how women used the civil disobedience movement for their empowerment.\"We were immediately struck by the emphasis on women in action,\" says Sumathi Ramaswamy of Duke University, who, along with her colleague Avrati Bhatnagar led the detailed examination of the album. In one picture, Lilavati Munshi, an intrepid Congress leader from Gujarat, instructs a group of men raiding a government-owned salt pan. In another, Munshi stands defiantly before the entrance of a boycotted British department store, uncowed by a group of British police officers towering over her - and stylishly dressed in a sleeveless sari blouse.This visual record of female leadership is unique. Despite its leftward leanings and Gandhi's prodding, Indian nationalist activity had remained an overwhelmingly male endeavour, with its own distinct patriarchal flavor. As recently as the noncooperation movement in 1920-22, women played a far more circumscribed role. Now, however, women's involvement took a quantum leap.Beyond recognisable figures like Munshi, the Nursey album documents thousands of completely unknown female volunteers. Women gather on the shores of Bombay's Chowpatty Beach, ready to make contraband salt. Members of the Desh Sevika, an all-female volunteer force, wrestle with police attempting to snatch away their provisional national flag. Perhaps most striking of all was how many female volunteers brought along their young daughters, inducting new generations of women into anticolonial politics.The Nursey album also points to remarkable inversions of gender dynamics. Long processions of women, many of them bearing a takli or spindle to honour Gandhi's commitment to homespun khadi cloth, take over Bombay's streets, quite literally pushing men to the very margins. Elsewhere, middle-class men, many of whom had rarely set foot inside a kitchen, hold impromptu classes where they instruct volunteers on boiling and cooking salt.It is these nameless men and women who help us better understand this chapter of India's history. \"We associate the civil disobedience movement with Gandhi,\" Ms Ramaswamy says. \"But when we began studying the album, we were soon convinced that it made a different argument: that the people of Bombay made the movement that in turn made Gandhi globally famous.\"The Alkazi Collection of PhotographyWomen leading a boycott procession while holding the provisional national flagThe Alkazi Collection of PhotographyA women-led procession in Mumbai promotes hand spinning, with participants carrying the takli (spindle) to honour Gandhi's commitment to homespun khadiHere, the camera played a critical role. In ways that could not be captured in written sources, photographs demonstrate women taking nationalist activities into their own hands: challenging policemen, drumming up support for boycotts, addressing crowds, directing salt production, and courting arrest. \"Participation in the nationalist movement was not only a catalyst for the political awakening of Indian women,\" Ms Bhatnagar says. \"It also created new possibilities for them to step into public roles and occupy civic spaces in ways that had rarely been seen before.\"Many of the photographed women look directly at the camera, conscious of their political activity being documented for posterity. In this way, Ms Bhatnagar continues, \"they claimed freedom from colonial rule but also from prevailing gendered division of spaces, between the domestic and the public\".The Nursey album is also a stunning testament to the urban transformation of Bombay. Below the domes and spires of a colonial metropolis, a discernible transfer of power is evident, as khadi-clad Congress volunteers outnumber pith-helmeted policemen and army soldiers. They commandeer the city's most prominent landmarks, rallying outside Victoria Terminus (today's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus) and climbing onto the neoclassical Fitzgerald Fountain at Dhobi Talao. Colonial authorities, meanwhile, transform the Worli chawls - tenement housing for cotton mill workers - into makeshift prisons for detained nationalists.\"Though photography already had a century-long history in Bombay, political activism was captured by the lens for the first time in the Nursey album,\" says Murali Ranganathan, a historian of Bombay.These photographs in the Nursey album are now back in public circulation. Ramaswamy and Bhatnagar recently released a book titled, Photographing Civil Disobedience, which includes many of the images alongside articles by a number of scholars. In October, they opened two museum exhibits, both titled Disobedient Subjects, at the CSMVS Museum in Mumbai and Duke's Center for Documentary Studies.The women volunteers of the civil disobedience movement are getting a belated acknowledgement of their defining role in one of India's biggest mass movements. Nearly a century later, their resolve and determination are as palpable as they were when first captured on camera.Disobedient Subjects runs at the CSMVS Museum in Mumbai through 31 March 2026 and at the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University through 19 January 2026.",

    "body": "Flights returning to normal after Airbus warning grounded planes16 hours agoHafsa KhalilGetty ImagesThousands of Airbus planes are returning to normal service after being briefly grounded following a warning that solar radiation could interfere with onboard computers.The aerospace giant - based in France - said about 6,000 of its A320 planes had been affected, with most requiring a quick software update. Some 900 older planes need a replacement computer.On Saturday, French Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot said the updates \"went very smoothly\" for more than 5,000 planes, and fewer than 100 still needed the update.Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury apologised for what he called \"logistical challenges and delays\".He said teams were working to ensure that updates are completed \"as swiftly as possible\".On Saturday morning, several Air France flights in and out of Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport were delayed or cancelled.American Airlines said it expected \"operational delays\" but added that the vast majority of updates would be carried out by Saturday. Delta Airlines said it believed the impact on its operations would be limited.The UK Civil Aviation Authority said that airlines operating in the country worked through the night to carry out the update and air traffic had not been seriously affected.London's Gatwick Airport reported \"some disruption\", while Heathrow said it had not experienced any cancellations.Manchester Airport said it did not anticipate significant problems, and Luton Airport reported that there was \"no expected impact\".British Airways and Air India are understood not to be heavily impacted by the issue.On Saturday, Easyjet said it had completed the update on a \"significant number\" of its aircraft, and planned to operate as normal.Wizz Air is also running as normal, having rolled out updates overnight.In Australia, budget airline Jetstar cancelled 90 flights. Most of its aircraft have now undergone the update, but some disruptions are expected though the weekend.Air New Zealand grounded its A320 planes, but all fights have now resumed after the update was completed.Airbus discovered the issue after a JetBlue Airways plane flying between the US and Mexico suddenly lost altitude and emergency landed in October. At least 15 people were injured.The firm identified a problem with the aircraft's computing software which calculates a plane's elevation, and found that at high altitudes, data could be corrupted by intense radiation released periodically by the Sun. As well as the A320, the company's best-selling aircraft, the A318, A319 and the A321 models were also affected.Older planes that require new computers remain grounded. How long the replacement takes will depend on the availability of computers.",

    "body": "4 hours agoYolande Knell,Middle East correspondentandMalak Hassouneh,JerusalemBBCIn a bustling Gaza City market, a money repairer expertly inspects a worn, yellow 100 shekel ($30.50; £23.10) note. He straightens it out and enhances its faded colour with careful strokes of a pencil.Baraa Abu al-Aoun should have been studying at university - but instead he ekes out a living from a table he has set up at the roadside, taking a small sum to help keep cash in circulation.Fixing banknotes is a thriving new business in Gaza.Ever since the deadly Hamas-led attack on Israel in 2023 and the devastating war that ensued, Israel stopped transfers of banknotes, along with most other supplies.Most banks were destroyed in Israeli strikes, and many were looted. While some branches have reopened since a ceasefire took effect seven weeks ago, there are still no working ATMs.But people need cash to buy food and essentials. That has forced them to turn to informal money merchants who charge enormous commissions to turn digital transfers into cash. It has also sparked a huge increase in the use of e-wallets and money transfer apps.And it means that every existing banknote matters more than ever - no matter how tattered. That's where Baraa comes in. \"My tools are simple: a ruler, pencils, coloured pencils and glue,\" he says.\"The ceasefire hasn't changed the financial situation. What I do now is to serve people and help them.\"Watch: Baraa Abu al-Aoun carefully restores a banknoteGaza's economic collapse has been so catastrophic during two years of intense war that a new UN report says its entire population of more than two million has been pushed into poverty.Four in five people are now unemployed according to the UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad), and even those who still have an income or savings struggle to access cash.\"It's pure suffering and nothing else,\" says Numan Rayhan, who is displaced in Gaza City from Jabalia in northern Gaza with few belongings. \"Shortage of income, shortage of money, no cash flow from the banks.\"Early in the war, Israeli strikes targeted banks, which Israeli officials alleged were linked to Hamas. Their vaults were looted by armed Palestinian gangs, some presumed to have been Hamas. The Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA) has previously said that cash worth about $180m (£136m) was stolen.Cogat, the Israeli defence body which controls Gaza's border crossings, confirmed that in line with a political order \"and due to Hamas's reliance on cash to maintain its military activity\", Israel has not been allowing cash to enter Gaza.Anadolu via Getty ImagesThe lack of cash circulating has \"caused problems for both sellers and buyers\", says Zakaria Ajour, a stall-holder at another market in Gaza City. People don't want to accept worn and delicate notes at face value any more, \"if there are even small scratches or pieces of tape on a note.\"Some customers come to me just because they want small change for transport, but I don't have change,\" Mr Ajour goes on. \"Ten-shekel coins are barely found, and even when they are, they have virtually no value because of inflation due to the cash crisis.\"Now, there are long lines outside the Bank of Palestine in Gaza City, one of nine branches of five banks that have reopened. Customers can only reactivate frozen accounts, open new ones, or sign on to banking apps.Asmaa al-Ladaa wants to set up an account so that she can receive money directly from her relatives living outside Gaza.\"The whole process is just chaos and crowds,\" she says. \"We woke up at 06:00 and left our children behind in a tent. We left everything just to come to the bank.\"NurPhoto via Getty ImagesIn the southern city of Khan Younis, where the banks are too badly damaged to reopen, Abu Khalil has just returned from a trek to central Gaza. After spending much of the day queuing, he did not manage to enter the bank there, and despairs at the idea of having to go back again.The grandfather still receives a monthly salary of about 2,000 shekels ($612; £463) from the Palestinian Authority, but says that almost half of his income goes on charges he pays to vendors or money merchants. \"You have to pay the fees.  There's no alternative,\" he complains.During the war, adapting to the urgent need for cash, many small businessmen who previously offered money transfer and exchange services began charging customers high commission to turn electronic transfers into cash. On occasion it has reached 50%, although it has recently dropped.One money merchant, who wishes to remain anonymous, tells us that market forces determine commission rates. \"Our work is directly tied to market activity and the entry of goods and aid,\" he says. \"When there's an inflow of goods, and active buying and selling, the commission drops significantly, sometimes down to as low as 20%. But when the crossings close, the rate rises.\"Anadolu via Getty ImagesElectronic transfers through bank apps - for which shop and stall owners charge minor fees - have become a popular workaround for Gazans making purchases, even of small items.The PMA, which acts as a financial regulator, has launched a payment system allowing instant transactions between local bank accounts. For those without accounts, The Bank of Palestine offers e-wallets and says there are now more than 500,000 users in Gaza. These transactions can be done without an internet connection or app, using text services on any mobile phone.E-wallets are being used to send financial aid directly to needy families, by humanitarian agencies including Unicef and the World Food Programme. Since early last year, Unicef says it has been able to make cash transfers to about a million people - half of them children. It prioritises vulnerable children, including amputees and orphans, and pregnant or breastfeeding mothers.\"Basically, you can go to the grocery store and the phone is used as a payment card, you can buy with it,\" explains Jonathan Crickx from Unicef. \"That allows a very high traceability of how the money is actually spent. From what we observed, 99% of all beneficiaries are spending first on food and water, second is hygiene items, like soap, and third is electricity through generators.\"Mr Crickx says he has personally witnessed families having to buy 2kg (4.4lb) of tomatoes for about $80, and 5kg (11lb) of onions for $70.Hanan Abu Jahel, who is displaced from Gaza City and lives in a camp in al-Zawaideh in central Gaza with her extended family, recently received 1,200 shekels ($367) from Unicef. She used it to buy basics like rice, lentils and pasta.But she says: \"My children need vegetables, fruits, meat and eggs. My youngest son especially craves eggs, but I can't get them as prices are still so high and I have to cover the needs of 12 people.\"US President Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan promises an \"economic development plan to rebuild and energise Gaza\", convening \"a panel of experts who have helped birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities of the Middle East\".It envisages new investments and \"exciting development ideas\" that can \"create jobs, opportunity and hope for future Gaza\". But there are no details about how to begin to generate growth and stability, just as the UN's trade agency warns that the strip is going through the most severe economic crisis ever recorded.Anadolu via Getty ImagesBack in Gaza City, Baraa Abu al-Aoun holds the banknote he has been working on up to the light. expertly. He has more customers waiting, attracted by his sign promising repairs \"with high professionalism and without adhesive tape\".As Baraa toils on, he longs for a return to a normal life with prospects of more profitable employment.\"I just want this war to end fully,\" he says.  \"My hope is to feel relief at last, so that I can study and work with a degree.\"In Gaza, we're just surviving.  We're not human beings anymore.\"More weekend picks",

    "body": "Pope Leo XIV has visited Istanbul's Sultan Ahmed Mosque - widely known as the Blue Mosque - in his first visit to a Muslim place of worship since he took up the papacy in May.The Pontiff was seen bowing as he entered the building, but it is reported he did not pray at the mosque, as his two predecessors had done.The Vatican said in a statement Leo undertook the tour \"in a spirit of reflection and listening, with deep respect for the place and for the faith of those who gather there in prayer\".The Pope is on a four-day trip to Turkey, after which he will visit Lebanon.He was later welcomed to St George's Cathedral in Istanbul by the head of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Patriarch Bartholomew.The Blue Mosque is officially named for Sultan Ahmed I, leader of the Ottoman Empire from 1603 to 1617, who oversaw its construction. It is decorated with thousands of blue and turquoise ceramic tiles and receives millions of visitors each year.Pope Francis prayed there in 2014, and Pope Benedict XVI did so in 2006.The first pope to officially enter a mosque was John Paul II, who made history when he visited the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus in 2001. The papal visit to Turkey and Lebanon had been planned by late Pope Francis, but its theme of building bridges was embraced by Pope Leo from the moment he stepped on the balcony of St Peter's Basilica after his election in May.At the start of his trip, he warned that the world should not give into \"a heightened level of conflict on the global level\", adding that \"the future of humanity is at stake\".In Lebanon - where an estimated third of the country is Christian - he is expected to meet more faith leaders and hear from young people. On the final day of the trip, he will celebrate Mass at the Beirut waterfront at the site of the 2020 port explosion, praying for the more than 200 people who were killed and 7,000 others injured.",

    "body": "Donald Trump has said that he will pardon the former president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted of drug trafficking charges in a US court last year. The US president said Hernández had been \"treated very harshly and unfairly\" in a social media post announcing the move on Friday.Hernández was found guilty in March 2024 of conspiring to import cocaine into the US, and of possessing machine guns. He was sentenced to 45 years in prison.Trump also threw his support behind conservative presidential candidate Nasry \"Tito\" Asfura in the Central American nation's general election, due to be held on Sunday.Hernández, a member of the National Party, who served as Honduras's president from 2014 to 2022, was extradited to the US in April 2022 to stand trial for running a violent drug trafficking conspiracy and helping to smuggle hundreds of tons of cocaine to the US. During his trial, prosecutors in New York said Hernández ran the Central American country like a \"narco-state\" and accepted millions of dollars in bribes from drug traffickers to shield them from the law.He was also ordered to pay a fine of $8m (£6m) as part of his sentence. Polls indicate this year's Honduran election remains a toss-up between three candidates including Asfura, the former mayor of Tegucigalpa and leader of the conservative National Party.Also in the running is Rixi Moncada, a former defence minister standing for the ruling left-wing Libre Party, and Salvador Nasralla, a television host with the centrist Liberal Party.Trump criticised Moncada and Nasralla on Friday, writing that the latter was \"a boderline Communist\" who was only running to split the vote between Moncada and Asfura.He characterised Asfura as \"standing up for democracy\" and praised him for campaigning against Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro, with whom Trump has engaged in a war of words in recent months.Nasralla has pledged to cut ties with Venezuela if he wins.At a press conference on Saturday, Moncada accused Trump of \"interventionist\" meddling after his endorsement of Asfura and his plans to pardon Hernández.The Trump administration has accused the left-wing Maduro - whose re-election last year was dismissed as illegitimate by many countries - of being the leader of a drugs cartel.It used countering drug trafficking as a justification for a military build-up in the Caribbean and has conducted strikes on vessels it says have been used for smuggling - though some analysts have described these moves as a means of pressuring Latin American leaders.Honduras has been governed since 2022 by President Xiomara Castro, who has forged close ties with Cuba and Venezuela.But Castro has maintained a co-operative relationship with the US, agreeing to preserve a long-running extradition treaty with it. Her country also hosts a US military base involved in targeting transnational organised crime in the region. More than 80 people have been killed in the US strikes on vessels suspected of being involved in the transport of narcotics since they began in August.US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth has said the aim of \"Operation Southern Spear\" was to eliminate \"narcoterrorists\". But legal experts have questioned the legality of the strikes, pointing out that the US has provided no evidence that the boats it has targeted were carrying drugs.",

    "body": "We searched for a true Christmas market - and may have found one1 day agoGrace Dean,in BirminghamandTenzin Sekhon,in BerlinBBCWooden huts are glittering with golden fairylights as groups of friends gather in woolly hats, warming their hands on mugs of mulled wine.Signs written in German are dotted about - Glühwein (mulled wine), Bratwurst (grilled sausage), Kinderpunsch (non-alcoholic punch).This isn't Germany - it's Birmingham's Frankfurt Christmas Market. Organisers say it's \"the largest authentic German Christmas market\" outside the country and Austria.Christmas markets are thought to have originated in Germany in the 14th Century, and its markets have long been admired since. But how close are the ones in the UK to that supposed traditional, real thing?BBC News visited some to find out - and perhaps provide some inspiration for your next festive visit.A taste of Germany... in Birmingham?On a cold Thursday afternoon in Birmingham, we have just met Nina Adler and Till Rampe, 27-year-old German students studying for PhDs in the UK's \"second city\".As we walk around the Christmas market, which snakes through streets close to Birmingham New Street railway station, they're reminded of home.They point to the wooden huts, food and drink, and the handicrafts as positive signs this is close to the traditional ideal. The chocolate-coated marshmallows at one stall impress Till, who is from a town near Frankfurt. \"I could swear they are from my hometown,\" he says.The warm lights of the Christmas market have given Birmingham city centre a festive glowBut other aspects of Birmingham's market are further removed from the German way - like the beer. \"People are just connecting Germany with beer,\" Nina, from Berlin, says. \"In Germany usually you drink mulled wine. This is very typical.\"And as for the pop tunes blaring out of the speakers in Birmingham - like The Power of Love - you probably wouldn't hear that at markets in Germany - rather it would be Christmas music and carols, she says.Nina Adler and Till Rampe were impressed by what they saw in BirminghamAlso visiting the market with us is Katharina Karcher, an academic at the University of Birmingham. Her verdict? It's \"super authentic\".Having been set up in 1997 and running annually since 2001, the Birmingham market is organised by Kurt Stroscher, who is also director of Frankfurt's Christmas market. He uses \"only wooden stalls and atmospheric white lights that don't blink\", with the stalls built in Germany and food and drink imported from there.It's mostly a thumbs-up for Birmingham's Christmas market when it comes to authenticity, then - but how does it compare to one in Germany?Birmingham's market stretches through several streetsOur visit to a Christmas market in BerlinWhile many Christmas markets in the UK have been running for a couple of weeks now, in Germany they have only just opened, as is tradition, on 24 November.Most German towns and cities have a Christmas market, with Dresden, Nuremberg and Cologne among the most famous.These markets hold \"huge symbolic meaning\" to Germans, says Dr Karcher, who's from near Frankfurt. Along with a religious undertone, \"they are what get people through the dark time\", she explains.Berlin Christmas market: A typical Christmas market includes large tents housing restaurants or bars and stalls selling a range of handmade giftsSome 800 miles away from Birmingham, the city of Berlin is home to more than 70 different, small Christmas markets. In Charlottenburg Palace in the west of the German capital, the market is bustling and filled with people of all ages when we visit on a Tuesday night.The smell of roasted almonds, caramelised apples, chocolate-coated fruit, mulled wine and grilled sausages fills the air, as Christmas carols are performed live on a stage and children enjoy a small, sparkling Ferris wheel.The 17th Century Baroque Charlottenburg Palace is illuminated in different colours, with falling snowflakes projected onto its facade and wooden stalls in front.So what exactly makes a traditional German Christmas market?The Christmas market we visited in Berlin used projections as well as fairy lightsTypically, they may have (as this one in Berlin does):Large tents housing entire restaurants or barsStalls selling a range of handmade gifts, including woolly hats, gloves, scarves, jewellery, handmade candles, wooden nutcrackers and other arts and craftsTraditional German foods like Lebkuchen, the German version of gingerbread often seen in cookie form, many kinds of sausages including Bratwurst, cheeses, hearty dishes like Langos (a deep-fried Hungarian flatbread with different savoury or sweet toppings) or goulash, and SpätzleMulled wine for those who drink alcohol, not so much beerA location in a square in the Altstadt, the old part of a town. And in cities - lots of different markets in different areasTo Magrita, 66, who is enjoying a mulled wine with her husband Dietmar, 69, German Christmas markets are characterised by their unique atmosphere: \"The colourful lights and Christmas decorations make it so special.\"Dietmar explains how \"Christmas markets are not the same as other markets labelled as 'Winter Market' or 'Winter Wonderland,' because of the fairytale-like feeling you only get at an authentic Christmas market\".\"I visited a Christmas market in Milan a few years ago, and it wasn't the same, it was just a collection of different stores,\" he adds.At another table, Anna and Karolina, both 19, are catching up over some chocolate-covered strawberries. \"Apart from the mulled wine and the food, the colourful lighting and the festive and cosy vibe are what make Christmas markets unique,\" says Anna.But in Karolina's view, \"the star... is definitely the food and drink. [It's] what really makes a Christmas market authentic\".Anna and Karolina were enjoying the Berlin marketOther Christmas markets in the UK Back in the UK, while Birmingham can boast about its markets authenticity, what of other locations in the UK?Christmas markets have become a staple of many UK cities - Manchester, Leeds, Bath, Edinburgh and Newcastle among them. Smaller markets, typically in historic settings, are also proving popular on TikTok, sometimes incredibly so. Since 2023, Lincoln Christmas market has been closed because of overcrowding concerns.When the BBC visited the market in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, earlier this week, we saw an open mic night, including a rendition of Neil Young's Heart of Gold, and stalls selling the likes of pasta, Greek gyros and Yorkshire pudding wraps. There were also German foods and signs, though far fewer than Birmingham.The Berlin market was bustling with people of all agesVisitors didn't seem to mind though. \"I quite like that,\" says Jamie Aycliffe, who was visiting the market with his wife and baby. \"We're doing our British version of the Bratwurst.\"But having been to Christmas markets across Europe himself, he felt the ones in the UK were \"not as good\" and \"a bit more commercial\".Others were visiting the Kingston Christmas market for the aesthetic.  \"It's fun,\" drama student Amelia Shannon, 22, says. \"I don't have to go to Germany for it.\"Overall, though, this was not as true to the traditional thing as in Birmingham, and also much smaller in size. Some people told us they'd prefer it if UK-based Christmas markets like in Kingston's sold more small gifts from independent businesses, like German markets do.Amelia Shannon (second from left) came to Kingston Christmas market with her friends, all drama studentsAnne-Teresa Markovic, an academic originally from Nuremberg, says she was struck  by the range of food and drink offerings being \"more prominent\" there than in Germany while visiting Christmas markets in Manchester and Leeds. She recalls seeing \"festive patatas bravas\" on the menu, which needless to say, aren't particularly German.Christmas markets in Germany are changing, though. There's often now more international food - and Dr Karcher says depictions of the patron Saint Nikolaus are increasingly becoming more about Santa Claus.Katharina Karcher has noticed Santa Claus becoming more prominent at German Christmas marketsThe warm glow exuded by Germany's Christmas markets was dimmed during deadly car attacks on a market in Berlin in 2016 and in the city of Magdeburg last year.Security has been stepped up at markets since. Some markets have been cancelled because the costs of security are too high for organisers.The Berlin Christmas market we visit is surrounded by a fence with large, concrete blocks placed along it, while a police car patrols one of the entrances.Despite the heightened security measures, the atmosphere seems relaxed.Anna and Karolina say they have never been to a Christmas market in the UK before, but would both welcome more Christmas markets outside of Germany. \"Christmas markets are not defined by their location,\" explains Anna, \"but by the festive atmosphere and the time of the year when they take place.\" Eight other 2025 Christmas markets in the UK you might like:Wells, Somerset: Taking place in the cathedral city for for one day, Saturday 6 December, featuring more than 100 stallsCanterbury, Kent: With 120 stalls, including in the grounds of its 11th-century cathedral, running until Christmas EveHaddon Hall, Derbyshire: Pre-booked tickets with parking at the country house have sold out, but non-parking tickets are available on the door for £9.50Chester, Cheshire: Stalls line Tudor and mock-Tudor streets, running until Monday 22 December, including a stall operated by Chester ZooHillsborough, County Down, Northern Ireland: Taking place on Friday 12 and Saturday 13 December, set against the 17th century Hillsborough FortAberdeen Christmas Village, Scotland: Featuring an ice rink and lots of stalls, it's running until 31 DecemberPortmeirion, North Wales: A scenic location in Gwynedd, running from Friday 5 to Sunday 7 December with a £10 entry feeWinchester, Hampshire: The Christmas market surrounds the cathedral, open until Monday 22 DecemberBirmingham's Christmas market seems to come close to authenticityMore weekend picks",

    "body": "16 hours agoAleks PhillipsandYang TianMore than 600,000 people in the Kyiv region of Ukraine were without power on Saturday morning after an overnight Russian attack.Ukraine's energy ministry said more than 500,000 of these were in the capital itself, with the rest in the surrounding region. It attributed the power losses to missile and drone strikes on energy infrastructure in the city and several other regions.Around 36 missiles and nearly 600 drones were launched on targets across Ukraine overnight, officials said, killing three and injuring dozens of others.Russia has intensified attacks on Ukrainian civilian and energy infrastructure as the embattled nation heads into winter, despite US-led efforts to secure a peace deal.Russia's defence ministry said it had launched \"a massive strike... against Ukrainian military-industrial complex enterprises and the energy facilities that support their operation\".Dtek Energy, which serves properties in Kyiv, said later on Saturday that power had been restored to more than 360,000 families.As well as energy infrastructure, several residential buildings were hit in the overnight strikes, Ukrainian officials said.Loud explosions were heard across Kyiv early on Saturday morning. Emergency services were later seen attending to burning blocks of flats damaged by strikes.Kyiv's Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said a 13-year-old child was among the 29 people injured in the capital city.Ukraine's Air Force said it shot down 558 of the drones and 19 of the missiles.Kyiv is among several cities that have suffered regular aerial bombardment since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Many Ukrainians have also had to live through regular blackouts, as Moscow has targeted energy infrastructure in previous winters.On Sunday it is forecast to fall to 2C in Kyiv, which has average temperatures below freezing in December.Ukraine has targeted Russian energy infrastructure, including oil refineries and depots, in particular with long-range weaponry that can probe deep inside Russia. It says this is to curb revenue for Moscow's war effort from Russia's main export.Meanwhile Ukrainian media is reporting that Ukrainian maritime drones struck two oil tankers in the Black Sea on Friday, which are thought to be part of Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\" of vessels used to evade Western sanctions.Video footage published online and verified by the BBC shows a waterborne drone barrelling towards one of the boats, before another video shows fire and smoke billowing out of the vessel's side.The stricken tankers are named Kairos and Virat, according to Turkish authorities. Both are flagged to Gambia. Footage released by Turkey's Transport Ministry shows two of its own boats trying to extinguish the fire on the Kairos.The latest bombardment came as Ukrainian negotiators were preparing for talks with US officials this weekend. US President Donald Trump is pushing for the two sides to accept a draft peace plan, which was initially slanted heavily in favour of Russia but subsequently revised during talks with Ukrainians and their European allies in Geneva.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has welcomed the diplomatic efforts while stressing Kyiv's need to retain its sovereignty and ability to fend off any future attack.On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin repeated his core demands for ending the war, saying Russia would only halt its offensive if Ukraine's troops withdrew from territory claimed by Moscow.Russian forces currently control most - but not all - of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, as well as a portion of the southern Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. US and European allies have called for the war to be frozen along the current front line.Putin also confirmed a US delegation including special envoy Steve Witkoff was expected in Moscow in the first half of next week to discuss the draft peace plan.",

    "body": "A diamond-studded crystal Fabergé egg that once belonged to Russia's imperial family has sold for a record £22.9m ($30.2m) in London.The Winter Egg - considered one of the legendary jeweller's most beautiful creations - was bought by an anonymous bidder on Tuesday, Christie's auction house said.It is decorated with 4,500 diamonds was commissioned by Tsar Nicholas II in 1913 as a present to his mother.The previous record for a Fabergé egg was £8.9m paid at auction in 2007.\"Today's result sets a new world auction record for a work by Fabergé, reaffirming the enduring significance of this masterpiece,\" Christie's Margo Oganesian was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency.The 8.2cm high (3.2in) egg was created by Carl Fabergé, based on the design of Alma Theresia Pihl, one of only two female workmasters at St Petersburg's jewellery company.It was carved from rock crystal and decorated with rose-cut diamonds, as well as platinum snowflake motifs. The egg opens up to reveal a tiny basket of white quartz flowers inside. The Fabergé house only ever made 50 eggs for Russia's imperial Romanov family, and the Imperial Winter Egg is one of just seven left in private hands. The others are either missing or owned by institutions or museums.The eggs were made from 1885 until Tsar Nicholas II was forced to abdicate in 1917.",

    "body": "A shipment of German ammunition has been stolen from a delivery lorry in the eastern town of Burg, the country's defence ministry has said. Speaking to Germany's DPA news agency, officials did not specify how much was taken. However, other reports cited a defence spokesperson as saying it was close to 20,000 rounds.The theft is thought to have taken place after the driver for a civilian transport company - contracted by the military - left his truck in an unguarded parking lot overnight on 25 November.The next day, when the delivery arrived at the nearby Clausewitz Barracks, the ammunition was found to be missing. The army has launched an investigation alongside police.Der Spiegel, among other German outlets, reported that the shipment contained 10,000 rounds of live ammunition for pistols, 9,900 rounds of blank bullets for assault rifles, and smoke grenades.Authorities have not confirmed whether anyone has been arrested or identified in connection with the incident, which has prompted security concerns around who may acquire the lost supplies.\"We take the theft very seriously - this kind of ammunition must not fall into the wrong hands,\" the defence ministry told German media.A focal point of the Bundeswehr (German army)'s investigation will be why the driver failed to identify a safe location for the stop, according to Germany's public broadcaster MDR.It reports that there is a special hotline available to drivers who need similar assistance and said the armed forces can provide an escort if required. The broadcaster said the driver left the vehicle in an unguarded parking lot and spent the night in a nearby hotel.This is the latest in a series of similar incidents in the the Saxony-Anhalt region.In August, local police in Bernburg reported 90 rounds of ammunition missing. Weeks earlier, officers in Eisleben reported they had lost 180 rounds.No immediate connection has been made between the cases.",

    "description": "A US appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, Alina Habba, has been unlawfully serving as top federal prosecutor ",
    "body": "A US appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, Alina Habba, has been unlawfully serving as top federal prosecutor for New Jersey - a ruling likely to affect scores of criminal cases in the state.The president handpicked Habba for the role of US attorney this year, but a district court rejected her nomination, so the Trump administration installed her in a role that allowed her to fill in on an acting basis.The appellate judges found on Monday that this tactic, which bypassed confirmation by the US Senate, violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. Habba is the second Trump-appointed prosecutor to be disqualified in recent weeks.\"It is apparent that the current administration has been frustrated by some of the legal and political barriers to getting its appointees in place,\" one of the appellate judges, Judge Michael Fisher, wrote in Monday's ruling disqualifying Habba. The BBC has contacted Habba's office, the White House, and the Department of Justice for comment. In a joint statement, three lawyers who had challenged Habba's authority - Abbe David Lowell, Gerry Krovatin, and Norm Eisen - wrote that this marks \"the first time an appeals court has ruled that President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions\".The statement continued: \"We will continue to challenge President Trump's unlawful appointments of purported US Attorneys wherever appropriate.\"Habba, 41, first joined Trump's personal legal team in 2021 after reportedly meeting him at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. She went on to represent Trump in his hush-money trial in New York last year, when he was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records. Trump has filed an appeal against that conviction. Before Habba took on the role of US Attorney for New Jersey, Trump had announced he was appointing her as his presidential counsellor during his second administration, describing Habba as \"unwavering in her loyalty\" and a \"tireless advocate for justice\".Monday's ruling may force the justice department to find a new prosecutor to supervise federal criminal cases in New Jersey. The appellate court's decision came after three men facing criminal charges in New Jersey argued that the prosecutor's appointment was unlawful, the BBC's US partner CBS News reported.A federal judge ruled in their favour in August. That order had been on hold while the appeals court heard the case. Habba is not the first Trump-appointed US prosecutor to face a legal challenge. A federal judge last week dismissed criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James on the grounds that the US attorney in the case, Lindsey Halligan, was not lawfully appointed as interim US attorney in Virginia. In October, a US district judge disqualified Bill Essayli from his role as acting US attorney for the Southern District of California, finding that he had stayed in the temporary post longer than the law allowed. But the judge allowed Essayli to continue overseeing the office - the most populous US federal judicial district, serving around 19 million people - in his role as first assistant US attorney. Defence attorneys have filed a motion to get that part of the judge's ruling reversed in an attempt to fully oust Essayli. In September, another US district judge disqualified Nevada's lead federal prosecutor Sigal Chattah, finding that she, too, was not lawfully serving as acting US attorney. ",

    "body": "20 hours agoTabby WilsonLuca Toni/Il Resto del CarlinoAn Italian mayor has apologised to the family of opera star Luciano Pavarotti after the town of Pesaro encased a statue honouring the late singer within a Christmas ice rink. The singer's widow, Nicoletta Mantovani, told local media that she was \"angry and upset\" at what she called the decision to \"ridicule\" her late husband. The temporary ice rink was constructed in the centre of the town's piazza, leaving Pavrotti's statue knee-deep in ice and surrounded by perspex walls. In response, Mayor Andrea Biancani said that he didn't mean to offend anyone, and admitted that his council had \"made a mistake\".Luca Toni/Il Resto del CarlinoBefore it was opened on 29 November, Biancani posted a doctored image of Pavarotti's statue playing ice hockey with the hashtag #DaiUnCinqueAPavarotti, which translates to \"Give a high-five to Pavarotti\".\"I didn't expect a town would allow this treatment of the memory and the image of a person who made Italy great around the world,\" Ms Mantovani told local outlet Il Resto del Carlino. She accused the council of making a \"poorly executed, absurd decision\". The life-size bronze statue was officially unveiled in Pesaro in April 2024, with Ms Mantovani and the couple's daughter, Alice, in attendance. The couple often holidayed in Pesaro, where Pavarotti had a villa and was an honorary citizen.Alamy/Luca Toni/Il Resto del CarlinoOpera star Luciano Pavarotti's statue seen earlier in the year in the town of Pesaro (left), and in November, surrounded by an ice rink (right).Biancini told Il Resto del Carlino, which nicknamed the incident \"Pavarotti on Ice\", that when plans for the ice rink were initially presented to him, he was assured that the Pavarotti statue would not be touched and that it was only later that he found out designers had been forced to alter their construction. He said it would not be possible to dismantle the rink or move the statue at this late stage, but insisted that it would \"not happen again\".Pavarotti was an Italian tenor, and is widely known as one of the most successful opera stars of all time.His performances in the Three Tenors concerts were seen around the world, and his rendition of Nessun Dorma, from Puccini's Turandot, which he performed at the 1990 football World Cup in Italy.His final performance was at the opening of the Winter Olympics in Turin in February 2006.He died the following year at the age of 71, after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Pavarotti left behind four daughters from his two marriages. Ms Mantovani was his second wife. She remarried, to financial advisor Alberto Tinarelli, in 2020. ",

    "body": "India tells smartphone makers to put state-run cyber safety app on new devices15 hours agoMeryl Sebastian & Abhishek DeyGetty ImagesIndia now has over 1.2 billion mobile subscribersIndia has ordered all new smartphones to come pre-loaded with a state-run cybersecurity app, sparking privacy and surveillance concerns.Under the order - passed last week but made public on Monday - smartphone makers have 90 days to ensure all new devices come with the government's Sanchar Saathi app, whose \"functionalities cannot be disabled or restricted\". It says this is necessary to help citizens verify the authenticity of a handset and report the suspected misuse of telecom resources. The move - which comes in one of the world's largest phone markets, with more than 1.2 billion mobile users - has been criticised by cyber experts, who say it breaches citizens' right to privacy.Under the app's privacy policy, it can make and manage phone calls, send messages, access call and message logs, photos and files as well as the phone's camera.\"In plain terms, this converts every smartphone sold in India into a vessel for state mandated software that the user cannot meaningfully refuse, control, or remove,\" advocacy group Internet Freedom Foundation said in a statement.Amid the growing criticism, India's Minister of Communications Jyotiradtiya Scindia has clarified that mobile phone users will have the option to delete this app if they don't want to use it.\"This is a completely voluntary and democratic system - users may choose to activate the app and avail its benefits, or if they do not wish to, they can easily delete it from their phone at any time,\" he wrote on X. The minister did not, however, clarify how this would be done if the app's functions cannot be disabled or restricted. Launched in January, the Sanchar Saathi app allows users to check a device's IMEI, report lost or stolen phones and flag suspected fraud communications.  An IMEI - the International Mobile Equipment Identity - is a unique 15-digit code that identifies and authenticates a mobile device on cellular networks. The code is  essentially the phone's serial number.In a statement, India's Department of Telecommunications said that mobile handsets with duplicate or spoofed IMEI numbers pose \"serious endangerment\" to telecom cyber security.\"India has big second-hand mobile device market. Cases have also been observed where stolen or blacklisted devices are being re-sold,\" it said, adding that this makes the purchaser an \"abetter in crime and causes financial loss to them\".Under the new rules,  the pre-installed app must be \"readily visible and accessible\" to users when they set up a device and its functionalities cannot be disabled or restricted. Smartphone makers must also \"make an endeavour\" to provide the app through software updates for devices that are out of factories but haven't been sold yet, the statement said. All companies have been asked to give compliance reports on the order in 120 days.Getty ImagesThe order requires all phones manufactured or imported in India to pre-install the app within 90 daysThe government says the move will bolster telecom cybersecurity. A Reuters report, citing official figures, says the app has helped recover more than 700,000 lost phones - including 50,000 in October alone.But experts say the app's broad permissions raise concerns about how much data it can collect, widening the scope for surveillance.Technology analyst Prasanto K Roy says the bigger concern is about how much access an app might eventually be allowed on the handset.\"We can't see exactly what it's doing, but we can see that it's asking for a great deal of permissions - potential access to just about everything from flashlight to camera. This is itself worrying,\" he told the BBC. On Google's Play Store, the app says it doesn't collect or share any user data. The BBC has reached out to the department of telecommunications with questions about the app and the privacy concerns related to it.  Mr Roy adds that compliance will be difficult, since the order runs counter to the policies of most handset-makers, including Apple.“Most companies prohibit installation of any government or third-party app before the sale of a smartphone,\" he says, \"barring in China and Russia”.While India's smartphone market is dominated by Android, Apple's iOS powered an estimated 4.5% of the 735 million smartphones in the country by mid-2025, according to Counterpoint Research. Apple has not commented publicly, but Reuters reports it does not intend to comply and \"will convey its concerns to Delhi\".India is not the only country to have tightened rules on device verification.In August, Russia ordered all phones and tablets sold in the country to come pre-installed with the state-backed MAX messenger app, sparking similar privacy and surveillance concerns.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "13 hours agoIan AikmanAFP via Getty ImagesProtests took place in cities across Bulgaria - the biggest for decadesBulgaria's government has said it will withdraw its controversial 2026 budget plan after massive rallies were held against it on Monday night in the capital, Sofia, and in cities across the country.Tens of thousands of people joined protests to oppose the draft budget, which they said attempted to hide widespread government corruption. Clashes with the police broke out when some masked protesters attacked the offices of the ruling conservative Gerb party and also of the DPS party in Sofia.The government said on Tuesday it would abandon the plan, which also would have raised taxes. It comes after similar protests broke out last week, when the initial plan was submitted to parliament.Next year's budget will be Bulgaria's first delivered in euros, as it joins the eurozone on 1 January.Public opinion over adopting the euro is divided, with some fearing it could lead to sharp inflation in what is one of the EU's poorest countries.Protests against government corruption have been frequent in Bulgaria, which has been run by short-lived governments since 2020, after protests sparked the end of another Gerb-led coalition.ReutersA drone view shows protesters gathered outside the parliament in SofiaMonday's rally is thought to have been the largest in the capital for years, with protesters filling a huge square in front of parliament carrying signs urging a change in leadership.Significant protests also took place in Plovdiv, Varna, Burgas, Blagoevgrad and other cities.Critics of the abandoned budget plan said they were protesting against increases to social security contributions and taxes on dividends to finance higher spending, as well as state corruption.\"We are here to protest for our future. We want to be a European country, not one ruled by corruption and the mafia,\" Ventsislava Vasileva, a 21-year-old student, told the AFP news agency.More than 70 people were arrested after masked protesters attacked the offices of political parties, according to Sofia's interior affairs chief Lyubomir Nikolov.ReutersProtesters in Sofia were seen setting bins on fire, breaking windows, and clashing with police in riot gearBulgarian President Rumen Radev called for an end to the violence, which he dismissed as a \"provocation by the mafia\", and urged everyone to obey the law. \"Provocations do not change the fact: Bulgarians said NO to this government,\" he said in a post on Facebook before the budget was abandoned. \"There is only one way out: resignation and early elections.\"As head of state, Radev holds a largely ceremonial role.The government is currently led by Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov, who formed a minority coalition in January 2025 after the centre-right Gerb party won October 2024's elections without a clear majority.A parliamentary committee had adopted the budget plan on 18 November, but Zhelyazkov later said he would delay it to allow for more time to consult opposition parties, trade unions and employers.After Monday's protests, Zhelyazkov's government issued a short statement saying it would withdraw its draft proposals and start a new budget procedure. Bulgaria's opposition party has called for the government to resign, saying abandoning the draft budget is not enough, according to local media.",

    "body": "Cyclone catastrophe in Sri Lanka awakens volunteer spirit30 minutes agoIshara Danasekara,News Editor, BBC News SinhalaandKoh EweWatch: Sri Lankan communities under water after catastrophic floodingSri Lankan actor and musician GK Reginold rides a motorised fishing boat through Colombo's suburbs, hoping to bring food and water to those in desperate need.Some of the families, Mr Reginold says, have not received aid for days, isolated by the South Asian island nation's worst weather disaster in recent years.Cyclone Ditwah lashed the country last week, bringing catastrophic floods and landslides that killed more than 460 people, left hundreds missing and damaged some 30,000 homes.But the deluge has also inspired volunteerism among its people, as they face what their president has described as the \"most challenging natural disaster\" in its history.\"The main reason why I wanted to do this, is to at least help them to have one meal,\" Mr Reginold tells the BBC. \"And I was so happy that I was able to do that.\"BBC SinhalaVolunteers have been taking fishing boats out to rescue flood victims and deliver aidMore than one million people have been affected by the disaster and President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has declared a state of emergency.Sri Lanka's military has deployed helicopters for rescue operations, while humanitarian aid is flowing in from foreign governments and non-governmental organisations.But it will be a long journey to recovery for Sri Lanka, which has seen its fair share of turmoil in recent years.Activists volunteer in community kitchenIn Colombo's Wijerama neighbourhood, activists who protested against former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2022 are now helping run a community kitchen that churns out food aid.The protests from three years ago were fuelled by a spiralling economic crisis that caused shortages of fuel, food and medicine. Public anger exploded and led to Rajapaksa being ousted. Now, that political activism is being channelled to cyclone relief.\"Some volunteers came after work, some took turns and some even took leave to be there,\" Sasindu Sahan Tharaka, a social media activist, tells the BBC.\"We reactivated the group as soon as we heard what was happening last Thursday,\" he says.Sasindu Sahan TharakaAt a community kitchen in Wijerama, volunteers prepare meals for flood-affected residentsMr Sahan also considers the kitchen as an \"extension\" of his volunteer work in 2016, when torrential rain and floods killed 250 people across the country.Volunteers have compiled hundreds of requests for help, sent it to authorities, and organised the distribution of food to residents, Mr Sahan says.\"Whatever we asked for, we got more than enough in response from the community,\" he says.Online campaigns for aidA flurry of activity is also happening online, where social media users have created a public database to direct donations and volunteers.Another volunteer-backed website helps donor find relief camps and what is most needed in those areas.Private companies have organised donation drives, while local television channels have launched an effort to provide food and basic necessities like soap and toothbrushes.Facing criticism over his handling of preparations for Cyclone Ditwah, President Dissanayake has urged Sri Lankans to \"set aside all political differences\" and \"come together to rebuild the nation\".Opposition politicians have accused authorities of ignoring weather warnings, which they say exacerbated the disaster's impact.On Monday, opposition lawmakers staged a walkout in parliament, claiming that the ruling party was trying to limit debate on the disaster.On the ground, however, there remains a sense of unity as Sri Lankans pick up the pieces after the floods.\"In the end, the joy of helping someone else to save lives makes that tiredness fade,\" Mr Sahan wrote in a Facebook post on Monday, after putting in long hours at the community kitchen in Wijerama and other relief sites.\"Disasters are not new to us. But, the empathy and capacity of our hearts is greater than the destruction that occurs during a disaster.\"",

    "body": "Putin hosts Trump negotiators at Kremlin for 'constructive' Ukraine talks2 hours agoMaia DaviesandLaura GozziGetty ImagesPresident Putin and his foreign policy aide Yury UshakovRussia's Vladimir Putin hosted US negotiators at the Kremlin on Tuesday for five hours of talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine.Putin's aide Yuri Ushakov said the discussions - held behind closed doors with US envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner - were \"constructive\" but \"a lot of work lies ahead\".Hours earlier, Putin had said European demands over a US-Russia draft peace place were unacceptable, adding that \"if Europe wants to fight with us, we are ready to do so\".The US envoys went to Moscow after similar talks with delegates from Kyiv in the last fortnight. Ukraine's President Zelensky said he expected a briefing by the US team after the meeting.He said there was an opportunity to end the war \"now more than ever\" but that elements of the proposals still needed to be worked out.\"Everything depends on today's discussions,\" Zelensky told a press conference in Dublin during an official visit to Ireland.Kyiv representatives  have twice met US negotiators, including Witkoff, Kushner and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, since the 28-point peace plan was circulated in November.It sparked shock in Ukraine and around Europe for appearing to favour the demands of Moscow, which invaded Ukraine nearly four years ago.After talks with Ukraine over the weekend, the White House said the proposals had been \"very much refined\", although details of the updated plans have not been confirmed. Some key disagreements between Moscow and Kyiv remain - namely regarding Ukrainian sovereignty over the territories Russia partly controls and security guarantees.Zelensky said on Tuesday there were \"no simple solutions\", repeating his country's insistence that Kyiv take part in peace discussions, and that clear security guarantees be agreed, such as Nato membership - a move long opposed by Russia and ruled out by Trump.\"We have to stop the war in such a manner that in one year, Russia would not come back\", Zelensky added.Putin appeared immovable on its demands as recently as last week, while Zelensky has repeatedly said he would never relinquish control of eastern Ukrainian regions.While Tuesday's talks were under way, Trump told his cabinet in Washington that the conflict had not been easy to resolve.\"Our people are over in Russia right now to see if we can get it settled,\" he said. \"What a mess.\"Kyiv's European allies had countered the 28-point plan with their own document - removing many of the most contentious elements, such as Washington's recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk as de facto Russian.Speaking ahead of Tuesday's meeting, Putin told reporters Europe's demands were \"not acceptable\" and that they were trying to hinder efforts towards peace.Zelensky had met French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, with several European leaders joining the meeting virtually. Macron said there was \"no finalised plan to speak of\" and that it could only be achieved with input from Ukraine and Europe.Meanwhile, fighting continued on the front lines on Tuesday. Ukraine's military said it was still engaging Russian troops in the key eastern city of Pokrovsk - contradicting Moscow's claim to have captured it.Russia's Ministry of Defence shared a video on Telegram claiming to show its troops holding up flags in the strategically important city, which they have been trying to seize for over a year.Ukraine's eastern military command claimed Russia had tried to \"flag-plant\" in the city so that \"propagandists\" could say it had been captured. \"They fled in a hurry, and the mopping up of enemy groups continues,\" it said in a statement on social media.Ukraine's military said its forces still controlled the northern part of the city, with Russian units suffering heavy losses, while international observers also disputed Russia's claim to the area.The military in Kyiv also dismissed Russia's claims to have captured the north-eastern Ukrainian border town of Vovchansk and said it had \"significantly improved\" its position in the northeastern city of Kupyans, which Russia claimed to have conquered a fortnight ago.Since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022, tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed or injured - alongside more than 14,000 civilians, according to the UN.Civilian targets including kindergartens, hospitals and residential buildings have been destroyed or heavily damaged by nightly drone or missile attacks.The conflict between the two ex-Soviet states stretches back to 2014 when Ukraine's pro-Russian president was overthrown and Russia responded by annexing Crimea and supporting armed uprisings in eastern Ukraine.",

    "body": "A Zambian-American influencer and political vlogger has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for hate speech for making insulting remarks about Zambia's President Hakainde Hichilema.Zambian-born Ethel Chisono Edwards, who also holds US citizenship and works as an estate agent in New York, has a large following across various social media accounts. Known as \"One Boss Lady\", she has become renowned for her rants about the president over the last two years.The 42-year-old was arrested at Zambia's main airport three months ago after arriving to attend her grandmother's funeral.She pleaded guilty in a magistrate's court in the capital, Lusaka, and apologised to the president for her comments.But Magistrate Webster Milumbe said the court had a duty to send a strong warning, noting that hate speech had become increasingly common.Edwards, who has been in police custody since her arrest, was convicted under the Cyber Security Act and the Cyber Crimes Act - new legislation that came into effect this year.She admitted to using a computer system to publish the offensive statements, acknowledged having no lawful excuse and conceded that her words were motivated by hatred.Her lawyer, Joseph Katati, described Edwards as a remorseful first offender with potential.He went on to detail how she was a breadwinner and philanthropist who sponsored a Zambian girls' football team that would suffer from her imprisonment.He also delivered a detailed public apology on her behalf.\"I want to unreservedly apologise to the president, Mr Hakainde Hichilema, his family, and the nation of Zambia for the words that I uttered against the president and for the negative effects that those words may have caused to the president, his family, and the nation at large,\" it said.Throughout her court appearances, Edwards appeared subdued - a stark contrast to her online persona.The magistrate acknowledged Mr Katati's plea for mitigation and said Edwards's sentence would be effective from the time of her arrest.Mr Katati said he had not yet received instructions from his client on whether to appeal against the sentence.The jailing of the influencer has divided opinion in Zambia, with some saying it was necessary while others arguing that it violates freedom of speech.Hichilema, who came to office in 2021, has abolished criminal defamation laws against the president, but Zambians still face prosecution under other laws.In September, two men were sentenced to two years in prison for attempting to use witchcraft to kill President Hichilema.",

    "body": "1 day agoPaul NjieBBC Africa, YaoundéAFP via Getty ImagesAnicet Ekane's  family was given little explanation - \"his wife was just presented the corpse\", his lawyer told the BBCLeft-wing Cameroonian opposition figure Anicet Ekane has died in detention, five weeks after he was arrested, his lawyers and party have announced.Ekane, 74, was among the leaders of an opposition coalition who endorsed Issa Tchiroma Bakary in October's presidential election.Tchiroma Bakary says he was the rightful winner of the poll, officially won by 92-year-old incumbent Paul Biya. Tchiroma Bakary has since fled to The Gambia.No official cause of Ekane's death has been announced. His party has accused the authorities of denying him access to his medication - a charge the government has denied.According to a spokesman for Ekane's African Movement for New Independence and Democracy (Manidem) party, Ekane died on Monday morning at a military medical facility, after his health worsened over the weekend.\"We have no clarification... His wife had been called to come and when she found herself there, she was just presented the corpse of her husband,\" he said.He added that the family later took the corpse to the mortuary.Defence ministry spokesman Capt Cyrille Serge Atonfack said the Manidem leader had died from illness, but did not give any further details.\"The deceased, who suffered from various chronic pathologies, had been interned at the Military Medical Centre of the National Gendarmerie,\" he said, adding that the politician had been well taken care of by doctors since his arrest on 24 October.Minister of Communication and government spokesperson René Emmanuel Sadi later expressed the government's condolences to Ekane's family, as well as the Manidem party.He also said that Ekane had received proper medical attention from both his personal doctors and those at the military hospital where he was admitted, adding that an investigation had been launched to determine the exact circumstances of Ekane's death.Renowned anti-corruption lawyer Akere Muna described Ekane's death as \"the extinguishing of a fierce and passionate flame\" that burned for democratic emancipation.Muna said in a statement that Ekane had informed him of his ill-health during their last conversation.\"One would have thought that basic humanity, the fundamental presumption of innocence, and the undeniable evidence of his failing health would have compelled his release to his family and the care of the medical experts who knew his condition,\" Muna said.According to Ekane's lawyers, he was accused of hostility against the state, incitement to revolt, and calls for insurrection.\"He was never presented before a judge or charged with any misdemeanour,\" said one of his lawyers, Hippolyte Meli, in a statement on social media, describing the detention of the Manidem party leader as \"illegal\".In recent weeks, rumours had circulated that the opposition figure had died, and Ekane's party members had demanded to see him \"dead or alive\".His death has sent shockwaves across the nation, with supporters gathering at the party headquarters in Douala to grieve. Others have taken to venting their anger online.Manidem says its premises have been surrounded by security forces.AFP via Getty ImagesOpposition protesters accused the ruling party of rigging the elections to ensure Paul Biya stayed in powerEkane initially endorsed another vibrant opposition figure, Maurice Kamto, for the presidential election. But Kamto, who endured a long detention after disputing the previous election in 2018, had his candidacy rejected upfront this time by both the electoral body, Elecam, and the Constitutional Council, on the grounds that the party had endorsed more than one candidate.Ekane and other politicians went on to create the Union for Change Coalition, which named former government spokesman Tchiroma Bakary as its candidate.At least 48 people were killed by Cameroon's security forces during protests against the re-election of President Biya, according to the UN.This included a number of people shot dead near Tchiroma Bakary's residence in the city of Garoua. He later claimed that snipers had been stationed at the house across from his, and were \"firing at point-blank range at the people\".The Cameroonian government has denied any wrongdoing.

    "body": "8 hours agoChris EwokorBBC Africa's West Africa correspondentNigeria has granted asylum to Guinea-Bissau presidential candidate Fernando Dias da Costa just days after a coup prevented the results of the recent election being announced.The 47-year-old, who ran as a candidate for the Party for Social Renewal, was under special protection at the Nigerian embassy, following \"threats made against\" him, Nigeria's foreign minister said.Dias was the main challenger to Umaro Sissoco Embaló, who was seeking a second term as president and has left the country following the military takeover.A delegation from the West African bloc Ecowas has been in the country, urging the military to step aside and release the results of the vote.But the electoral commission has now said it will not be able to publish the results as armed men wearing balaclavas had destroyed paperwork and the main computer server that was storing the results from different regions.Both Embaló and Dias had claimed victory in presidential poll held on 23 November.The PAIGC party, the liberation movement that ended Portuguese colonial rule, had been barred from fielding a candidate.The coup took place three days after the vote. The military suspended the electoral process, blocked the release of the results and insisted it was acting to thwart a plot to destabilise the politically unstable country.The junta has also tightened restrictions in the country, banning all demonstrations and \"all disturbing actions of peace and stability in the country\". Tensions remain high in the capital, Bissau. PAIGC said its headquarters had been \"illegally invaded by heavily armed militia groups\" following the coup.Its leader, Domingos Pereira, was arrested on the day of the coup, according to family and party members. Dias said he escaped from his campaign headquarters on the day of the coup as armed men came to arrest him.Nigeria's Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar said President Bola Tinubu had agreed to give Dias protection inside the Nigerian embassy in Bissau.\"The decision to accommodate Mr [Fernando Dias] da Costa in the Nigerian premises underscores our firm commitment to safeguarding the democratic aspirations and the sovereign will of the good people of Guinea-Bissau,\" Tuggar said in a letter to Ecowas Commission president Alieu Omar Touray.The letter also asked that soldiers from an Ecowas unit in the country be deployed to the Nigerian embassy to keep Dias safe.Meditation talks on Monday between the Ecowas delegation, led by Sierra Leone's Foreign Minister Alhaji Musa Timothy Kabba, and the junta were heated.Afterwards, Kabba told journalists that the discussions were \"productive,\" but noted that \"both parties expressed their concerns\". The junta has already sworn in a new transitional leader, Gen Horta N'Tam, who will rule the country for a year.Ecowas leaders have suspended Guinea-Bissau from all decision-making bodies until constitutional order is restored.On Tuesday, Idrissa Djalo, a senior official of the electoral commission, explained how its offices had come under attack on the day of the coup.\"They confiscated the computers of all 45 staff members who were at the commission that day,\" he said in a statement.Not only had the results held there been destroyed but also election tally sheets from the two key regions that were being transferred to the capital were intercepted and confiscated by armed men, he added.The true motives behind the coup in Guinea-Bissau remain unclear amid speculation that it may have been staged.Senegal's Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko and Nigeria's ex-leader Goodluck Jonathan have both said the coup was fabricated without providing evidence. Some local civil society groups have also accused Embaló of masterminding a \"simulated coup\" against himself with the help of the military, saying it was a ruse to block election results from coming out in case he lost.Embaló, who has previously faced accusations of using crises to quash dissent, has not responded to the coup allegations.The 53-year-old was allowed to leave for neighbouring Senegal on Thursday, from where he reportedly moved on to Congo-Brazzaville at the weekend.Guinea-Bissau has witnessed at least nine coups or attempted coups over the last five decades.Sandwiched between Senegal and Guinea, it is known as a drug-trafficking hub where the military has been influential since it gained independence from Portugal in 1974.",

    "description": "1 day agoMadeline HalpertandNada Tawfik,North America correspondentLuigi Mangione, the man accused of fatally shooting United Healthcare CEO Brian Tho",
    "body": "1 day agoMadeline HalpertandNada Tawfik,North America correspondentLuigi Mangione, the man accused of fatally shooting United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan a year ago this week, appeared in court on Monday as his lawyers challenge the admissibility of key evidence in his case.Mr Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to both state and federal murder charges, which carry the possibility of the death penalty.The pre-trial hearing could last several days, as defence attorneys are expected to call a host of witnesses, including from Pennsylvania, where he was arrested at a McDonald's.In September a judge threw out state terrorism-related murder charges against Mr Mangione, arguing prosecutors had failed to establish evidence to justify them.Mr Mangione's legal team is now hoping to convince a judge to exclude evidence including a gun and a notebook in which prosecutors say he set out a motive.The defendant was arrested days after he allegedly shot Mr Thompson, a father of two, as he was walking into an investors' conference on a busy Manhattan street on 4 December 2024.A date for either of his trials has not yet been set.Walking into court on Monday, Mr Mangione wore a grey suit and shirt, and court employees removed his hand restraints before he sat, as his lawyers requested.This week's hearing focuses on whether prosecutors illegally obtained evidence from Mr Mangione when they arrested him in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and whether it should be excluded as a result.Defence attorneys are seeking to suppress some of Mr Mangione's statements he made to police after being arrested - including allegedly giving them a false name.They argue he did so before police read him his rights, including the right to remain silent.His attorneys are also hoping to exclude from the trial a 9mm handgun that prosecutors say matches the one used in the killing, as well as writings found in Mr Mangione's backpack.Listen: The Mangione Trial podcastProsecutors have alleged that Mr Mangione - the scion of a prominent Maryland family who graduated from an Ivy League university - had written in his notebook about \"the deadly, greed fueled health insurance cartel\".But defence lawyers are arguing his backpack was searched without a warrant, and the items found in it should be excluded for that reason.Eliminating those two critical pieces of evidence - that point to a murder weapon and motive - would be a big win for Mr Mangione's legal team.But the chances of that happening are \"virtually non existent\", said Dmitriy Shakhnevich, a criminal defence attorney in New York.He said that's because there are a number of exceptions to constitutional rules that law enforcement must obtain a warrant for personal searches, including some that may cover this case.\"In a case like this where there's a manhunt for a violent suspect who committed this alleged crime in plain view in New York City, nobody's getting a warrant,\" Mr Shakhnevich said. \"When they get him, they're going to search him.\"Prosecutors say they have other key evidence against the defendant, including DNA or fingerprints on items discarded near the crime scene.Mr Mangione's attorneys are probably aware of the long odds of getting evidence excluded, Mr Shakhnevich said.He added that the main reason why defence lawyers hold these type of proceedings is to preview trial testimony from law enforcement.So far, the court has heard from New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner of Public Information Sgt Chris McLaughlin, who was asked to review surveillance images from after the shooting.Prosecutors in court also played CCTV showing the killing. A worker who handled security cameras at the McDonald's in Altoona testified as well.Prosecutors played a 911 call for the court from a manager at the fast food restaurant who said customers had told her one patron looked like the suspect in Mr Thompson's killing. The manager said she had looked online for pictures of him but could only make out Mr Mangione's eyebrows as he ate in the restaurant, since he wore a hat and face mask. The court also heard from a correctional officer at the jail where Mr Mangione was being held who said he appeared \"unbothered and logical\" as the two discussed literature and health care, though Mr Mangione did not give his opinion on the latter topic. The officer said Mr Mangione was placed under a high level of security because they wanted to avoid an \"Epstein-style situation\", a reference to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself while in a federal detention centre. Mr Shakhnevich said the legal team wants to have this type of information from witnesses so they can be aware of what people might say at trial, and to be on the lookout for any inconsistencies in their statements.\"The benefit of the hearing is that you get to have law enforcement officials testify, and you get to bind them to testimony for a trial later on,\" he said.Mr Mangione's legal team has also been pushing to bar the federal government from seeking the death penalty.They have said comments from high-ranking officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, accusing Mr Mangione of the murder have prejudiced his case, which they claim is motivated by politics.",

    "body": "18 hours agoFlora DruryandBBC IndonesianWatch: BBC reports from the site of deadly flooding in West SumatraThe death toll in the floods which struck Indonesia last week has now climbed to 631 on Tuesday, with rescue workers still battling to reach affected areas.The floods, which were caused by a rare cyclone that had formed over the Malacca Strait, have hit three provinces and impacted some 1.5 million people, according to the government's disaster agency.Nearly 500 people remain missing, while thousands more have been injured.Indonesia is just one part of Asia which has been hit with torrential rain and storms in recent days, with Thailand, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka all also reporting deaths.In Indonesia, the provinces of Aceh, North Sumatra and West Sumatra have been hardest hit, with thousands still cut off and without critical supplies.About one million people have been evacuated, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency said.Arini Amalia, a resident from Aceh's Pidie Jaya Regency, told the BBC the flood waters had been \"like a tsunami\".\"According to my grandmother, this is the worst, the worst in her life,\" Amalia said.Aid workers have been trying to reach people on foot and by motorcycle, as many roads are impassable to larger vehicles.Pictures from the region show bridges washed away, roads covered in mud and debris, and logs piled high.At West Sumatra's Twin Bridges landmark, where flood waters swept through and deposited enormous amounts of mud and debris, Mariana watched as excavators cleared the roads, hoping they would find her missing family members including her 15-year-old son.\"Watching the excavators, seeing how thick the mud is… I keep thinking, what condition will my child be in when they find him?\" she said. \"Will he still be intact? My mother, my brother-in-law… Looking at how it is here, maybe their faces won't even be recognisable any more.\"ReutersThe floods have impacted some 1.5 million people in IndonesiaMany are still waiting for food aid, with some saying they have not eaten for two to three days.Maysanti, who lives in Central Tapanuli which is one of the worst-hit areas in North Sumatra, told the BBC that aid workers were having trouble reaching her district.\"Everything is gone; our food supplies are running out. We can't eat,\" she said. \"Even instant noodles are being fought over now. Our food is gone; we need food and rice. Access to us is completely cut off.\"She said she has to walk kilometres away from her house to get an internet connection and basic necessities, like clean water.In Central Aceh where local authorities have provided Starlink devices, thousands were seen queuing outside the regency's office on Sunday night hoping to contact their loved ones or charge their mobile phones.\"It's been five days with no signal. We've been waiting since yesterday in case the network comes back. I'm planning to call my mother in Banda Aceh, but until now I still can't reach her,\" said one resident called Mar.As rescue efforts continue, anger has started to grow towards the government's disaster response.Critics say that authorities were ill-prepared for the floods. Some have blamed bureaucratic red tape for slowing down the distribution of food aid.Some activist groups have also claimed that environmental mismanagement, including the clearing of land for mining and agriculture, worsened the impact of the floods. On Monday, President Prabowo Subianto - who was visiting some of the flood affected areas in North Sumatra - acknowledged some roads were still cut off, but added \"we're doing everything we can to overcome difficulties\".\"We face this disaster with resilience and solidarity,\" he continued. \"Our nation is strong right now, able to overcome this.\"ReutersRescue workers and aid are still struggling to reach some areasAcross South and South East Asia, about 1,200 people have been killed in the last week in flooding and landslides. In Sri Lanka, at least 390 people died, while in Thailand the death toll has reached at least 176.However, there is no single weather event that has caused the floods. Instead, a combination of weather features have been to blame.According to BBC Weather, one element is the north-east monsoon, which affects East and South Asia from around November until March. As the name suggests, it brings north-easterly winds, which deliver a lot of rain to coastal areas exposed to this monsoon flow as moisture is picked up from the ocean and deposited over land.In Sri Lanka, the rainfall has been significantly enhanced by Cyclonic Storm Ditwah, which became very slow moving, delivering over half a metre of rain over a few days in some locations.That storm has now weakened and moved away northwards to bring rain in south-east India, with the forecast for Sri Lanka looking much drier over the coming days.In the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and southern Thailand, Cyclonic Storm Senyar had a similar effect, enhancing the monsoon and delivering more than a metre of rain in some places. This was a particularly rare storm, forming unusually close to the equator where cyclones do not normally develop.In Vietnam, the last few weeks have been exceptionally wet, with the monsoon rains having been enhanced by tropical cyclones. Now the remnants of ex-Typhoon Koto are drifting towards the Vietnamese coast, threatening more heavy downpours and further flooding.It is likely that climate change has also had a part to play. While global warming is not expected to lead to more tropical storms and cyclones, those that do occur have the potential to be more intense - with heavier rainfall leading to more flooding.",

    "body": "8 hours agoDavid GrittenReutersPope Leo said he was \"deeply moved\" by his visit to the site of the Beirut port blastPope Leo XIV led a silent prayer at the site of the Beirut port explosion and demanded justice for its victims, as he wrapped up his three-day visit to Lebanon.He also met some relatives of the 218 people who were killed by the massive blast on 4 August 2020, which devastated a large part of the capital.Later, the Pope said he was \"deeply moved\" by his visit to the port and shared \"the thirst for truth and justice, of so many families, of an entire country\".No-one has yet been held accountable for the disaster, which happened when a fire triggered the detonation of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been stored unsafely at a port warehouse for almost six years.It is widely believed that officials and politicians were aware of the combustible chemical's existence and the danger it posed but that they failed to secure, remove or destroy it.Victims' relatives and activists say the domestic investigation into the disaster has been hampered by the political leadership's efforts to shield those responsible from scrutiny.Cecile Roukoz, whose brother Joseph was killed, said the Pope's visit to the memorial was \"very important\". \"We know that he raises his voice for justice, and we need justice for our brothers and all the victims of this explosion,\" she added.Tatiana Hasrouty, who lost her father Ghassan in the blast, said: \"He's trying to help us find the truth in some sort of way, in his way, maybe in praying and maybe in just looking at us... We, the families, now, after five years, we need people to look at us.\"EPAAn estimated 150,000 people gathered at Beirut's waterfront for the Pope's final Mass in LebanonAfter praying at the blast site, the Pope celebrated the final Mass of his trip in front of an estimated 150,000 people gathered on Beirut's waterfront.Addressing the crowd, he lamented that the beauty of Lebanon had been \"overshadowed by poverty and suffering, the wounds that have marked your history\".But he appealed to the country's diverse communities to unite to solve its problems.\"Let us cast off the armour of our ethnic and political divisions, open our religious confessions to mutual encounter and reawaken in our hearts the dream of a united Lebanon,\" he said. \"A Lebanon where peace and justice reign, where all recognise each other as brothers and sisters.\"Returning to Rome on Tuesday, the Pope told reporters that Lebanon was an example of \"a land where Islam and Christianity are both present and are respected\".He later added: \"I think those are lessons that would be important to be heard in Europe or North America - that we should perhaps be a little less fearful, and look at ways of promoting authentic dialogue and respect.\"Since the last papal visit in 2012, Lebanon has been plagued by multiple crises.In 2019, the country suffered one of the worst economic depressions recorded in modern times, which pushed millions into poverty.It was followed by mass anti-government protests, the coronavirus pandemic, and then the Beirut port explosion.Political paralysis prevented the country from passing the economic and structural reforms demanded by foreign donors in return for billions of dollars in aid.Lebanon was later devastated by the 13-month war between the Shia Muslim Hezbollah movement and Israel, which killed 4,000 Lebanese and 120 Israelis.A ceasefire ended the conflict a year ago, but Israel has continued to attack targets it says are linked to Hezbollah, accusing the Iran-backed group of trying to rearm.Additional reporting by Aleem Maqbool",

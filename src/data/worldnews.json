    "body": "A Chinese woman has been charged with the theft of six gold nuggets worth about 1.5 million euros ($1.75m; £1.3m) from the Museum of Natural History in Paris last month, French prosecutors have said.The woman was arrested in Barcelona while trying to dispose of some melted gold, according to officials, and is being held in pre-trial detention.Famous for its stuffed animals and bone collections, the museum is home to a mineralogy gallery, from which the gold was taken. Police found an angle-grinder and a blowtorch at the scene.The museum's alarm and surveillance systems had been disabled by a cyber-attack, with the thieves apparently aware of this, French media reported at the time.\"The thieves, clearly very experienced and well-informed, exploited a security flaw that had not been identified during the last audit conducted in 2024,\" a museum spokesperson told French newspaper Le Figaro.Cleaners discovered the break-in when they arrived for work before dawn at the museum, which is part of the Sorbonne university and located near the Jardin des Plantes in central Paris.The suspect was arrested by Spanish police on 30 September on a European arrest warrant and handed over to French authorities on the same day, officials said in a statement.At the time of her arrest, she was in possession of around a kilogram of melted-down gold. Investigations are continuing, the statement added. It is believed she was preparing to leave for China.One of the largest stolen nuggets, originally from Australia, weighs 5kg. At the current gold price, it would be worth around €585,000.\"We are dealing with an extremely professional team, perfectly aware of where they needed to go, and with professional equipment,\" Emmanuel Skoulios, the museum director, told French broadcasters.\"It is absolutely not by chance that they went for these specific items,\" he told France 2 television last month.The charges come just days after thieves made off with priceless French crown jewels from the Louvre Museum in a separate, daring raid. On Sunday, \"professional\" thieves broke into the world's most-visited museum, stealing eight valued items before escaping on scooters. The raid took less than eight minutes, police said.Experts told the BBC that the items are likely to be broken up and sold for a fraction of their worth.\"This won't be their first heist,\" Dutch art detective Arthur Brand said of the thieves on Monday. \"They have done things before, other burglaries. They are confident and they thought, 'we might get away with this', and went for it.\"At least four French museums - including the Louvre and the natural history museum - have been robbed in recent months, according to media reports.",

    "body": "8 hours agoDearbail JordanEPAColombia's former President Alvaro Uribe faced 12 years' house arrest for fraud and briberyColombia's former president has had two convictions for fraud and bribery overturned after he was sentenced to 12 years of house arrest.Alvaro Uribe became the first Colombian leader to be criminally convicted after a trial in August in which a judge handed the 73-year-old the maximum sentence.  The case against him was linked to claims he ordered a lawyer to bribe jailed paramilitaries to discredit claims he had ties to their organisations. Uribe has always maintained his innocence. The right-wing politician, who was president between 2002 and 2010, is best  known for waging an aggressive offensive against left-wing Farc rebels and remains an influential figure in the South American nation.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio previously criticised Uribe's conviction, arguing that his only crime \"has been to tirelessly fight and defend his homeland\".Uribe was originally convicted, in part, on testimony from a former paramilitary commander, Luis Carlos Velez, who said he had been paid bribes by the president's lawyer, Diego Cadena.But the Superior Court in the capital, Bogotá, found that the ex-commander's testimony lacked credibility. In its 700-page decision overturning the convictions, the court also found that some of the wiretaps used to open a formal investigation into Uribe had been obtained illegally. The ruling can be appealed by people classed as victims in the case.Colombia's current and first left-wing President Gustavo Petro denounced the outcome.  He wrote on X: \"This is how the history of paramilitary governance in Colombia is covered up, that is, the history of politicians who came to power allied with drug trafficking.\"Paramilitary groups emerged in Colombia in the 1980s to fight the Marxist-inspired guerrilla groups that had been battling the state since the 1960s.Many of the armed groups that developed in the conflict made an income from the cocaine trade. Deadly fighting between them and with the state has produced lasting rivalries for trafficking routes and resources.Right-wing paramilitary groups have been found responsible for massacres, disappearances and other atrocities.Some left-wing guerilla outfits have also been found to have been involved in massacres and threats against Colombian citizens, according to Human Rights Watch.",

    "body": "22 hours agoLana LamSydneyCSIRO/Cindy BesseyThe new species of porcelain crab was found more than 100m below the ocean's surfaceA semi-transparent crab about the size of an almond and a tiny, glowing lantern shark are among two new species discovered by Australian scientists exploring the deep sea.In late 2022, scientists from Australia's science agency CSIRO embarked on a research voyage in the Gascoyne Marine Park, about 20km (12 miles) off the coast of Western Australia.Australia is one of the world's biggest biodiversity hotspots, home to more than a million different species, many of which are not found anywhere else on earth.But - like much of the globe - large swathes of its water remain unexplored, and the animal and plant life within them unknown to science.Among the hundreds of specimens collected during the 2022 voyage was the newly described West Australian Lantern Shark. Growing up to 40cm, it has large eyes and a glowing belly, and was found more than 600m below the ocean's surface.\"Lantern sharks are bioluminescent, with light produced by photophores located on their belly and flanks, which is where their common name comes from,\" Dr Will White, a fish scientist, said.CSIROThe West Australian lantern shark has large eyes and can grow up to 40cmThey also discovered a new type of porcelain crab, about 1.5cm in length and found about 122m below sea level. They use hairs to catch food, instead of their claws.\"Porcelain crabs are known as filter feeders, feeding on plankton by using modified mouthparts with long hairs to sweep the water for small pieces of food such as plankton, rather than the typical crab method of grabbing and pinching food with their claws,\" said Dr Andrew Hosie, curator of aquatic zoology from the Western Australian Museum.About 20 new species have been unearthed as a result of the voyage so far, including the Carnavon Flapjack Octopus, a rusty red creature around 4cm big.Researchers estimate about 600 more are yet to be described and named, as it can take years for scientists to gather the information to prove they're unique.",

    "body": "Hamas ruled Gaza with an iron rod - will it really give up control?1 day agoPaul AdamsDiplomatic correspondent, Jerusalem andRushdi AbualoufGaza correspondentBBCHow does a group that has governed the Gaza Strip for almost 20 years, ruling two million Palestinians with an iron rod and fighting Israel in repeated wars, suddenly lay down its arms and relinquish control?Judging by a steady stream of gruesome images emerging from Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect on 10 October, Hamas seems intent on reasserting its authority.Its masked men, back on the streets, have been seen beating and executing opponents. Impromptu firing squads have dispatched kneeling men they say are members of rival groups, including some of Gaza's powerful clans.Other victims, cowering in terror, are shot in the legs or beaten with heavy clubs.Some of those now being attacked by Hamas had been part of groups involved in looting and diverting aid, according to one aid worker I spoke to, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. The UN has also accused criminal gangs of stealing aid.This is not yet a world in which, as US President Donald Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan envisages, Hamas fighters turn over their weapons, submit to an amnesty, leave Gaza and hand over to an international stabilisation force.AFP via Getty ImagesThe ceasefire came into effect on Friday 10 October​ - Hamas and Israel have both blamed each other for blatant violations of itFor his part, President Trump initially seemed ambivalent about the brutality.On his way to Israel on 13 October, he signalled the US had given Hamas - designated a terrorist group by the US, UK, Israel and others - a green light to restore order.\"We have given them approval for a period of time,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One.Three days later, he hardened his tone. \"If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal,\" he wrote on Truth Social, \"we will have no choice but to go in and kill them.\"So, where does this situation on the ground in Gaza today leave Hamas? And ultimately, after two years of war that has resulted in unparalleled suffering for its own people and the violent death of most of its key figures, what, if anything, does the future really hold for the group?'A complete loss of law and order'For many Gazans, traumatised and exhausted by two years of perpetual suffering - and a war that has killed 68,000 people in Gaza according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry - this ugly endgame is nerve-wracking, but doesn't come as a surprise.Of the Gazans I spoke to - among them, aid workers, lawyers, as well as a former adviser to a Hamas leader - each has a different take on the likelihood of Hamas laying down its arms and relinquishing control. And indeed - given the situation on the ground - whether now is the time for them to do so.Anadolu via Getty ImagesPalestinians gathered to celebrate following the announcement of the ceasefire agreement \"It's been two years with a complete loss of law and order,\" aid worker Hanya Aljamal says from her home in Deir al-Balah, in the middle of the Gaza Strip. \"We need someone to take over.\"As unqualified as Hamas is to rule the Strip, they are a better option than the gangs.\"Dr Ahmad Yousef, a former advisor to Ismail Haniyeh, who was Hamas's political leader, is of the opinion that a firm grip is needed at present.\"As long as there are still people who try to take the law into their hands, we need somebody to scare them and squeeze them to the corner,\" says Dr Yousef, who now runs a Gaza think tank and remains close to the Hamas leadership.'As unqualified as Hamas is to rule the Strip, they are a better option than the gangs,' argues aid worker Hanya Aljamal \"This will take time. Not a long time. Within a month we will host those police forces and soldiers from Turkey and Egypt,\" he continues, referring to the international stabilisation force for Gaza, outlined in the peace plan, that could be composed of troops from Egypt and Turkey, among others. \"This is the moment where they will set their guns aside.\"Other Gazans are more sceptical, and fearful. Some aren't convinced that Hamas will give up their power - or weapons at all.Moumen al-Natour, a Gaza-based lawyer imprisoned several times by Hamas, is one of them. AFP via Getty ImagesMany Palestinians and Israelis doubt Hamas is willing to step back from a political roleHe has been in hiding since July, when he says masked Hamas gunmen came to his Gaza City apartment and ordered him to report to al-Shifa hospital for interrogation.\"Hamas is [sending] a message to the world and to President Donald Trump… that they will neither relinquish power nor hand over their weapons.\"If I fell into Hamas' hands now, they would make a video and kill me in the street with a shot to the head,\" he says in one of a series of videos sent to us from an undisclosed location in the Gaza Strip. The wall behind him is riddled with bullet holes.Moumen al-Natour, a Gaza-based lawyer: 'If I fell into Hamas' hands now, they would make a video and kill me in the street with a shot to the head'\"It is a gang, not a government,\" he says of Hamas. \"I don't want them to remain in Gaza… I don't want them in government, and I don't want them in security. I don't want to see their ideas spread in mosques, in the streets, or in schools.\"'Still the dominant player in Gaza'Mr al-Natour has his own take on what Gaza could look like.The disparate array of militias now under Hamas assault could, in his view, be integrated into a new security apparatus. But with their competing agendas, sometimes murky pasts and, in some cases, controversial links to the Israeli military, it's a problematic proposition.\"The fact is – and sometimes it's very hard for Israelis to admit this – that Hamas still exists and is the dominant player in Gaza.\" says Dr Michael Milshtein, a former head of the department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence.\"Relying on suspicious players - clans, militias, gangs, many of them criminals, many of them affiliated with ISIS [the Islamic State group], many of them involved in terror attacks against Israel - and considering them as a kind of alternative to Hamas is an illusion.\"'Hamas still exists and is the dominant player in Gaza' says Dr Michael Milshtein, a former head of the department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military IntelligenceHamas officials have said the group is willing to hand over political control of Gaza. The Trump ceasefire plan, to which it gave its qualified support, envisages \"temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee\".But even if the group is willing to step back from a political role – something many Palestinians and Israelis still doubt - persuading its battle-hardened fighters to lay down their weapons is a big step for an organisation whose power, even before October 2023, relied heavily on the force of arms.Rise of Hamas and its iron gripTo begin to answer the complex question of what may happen to Hamas next requires delving backwards into how exactly it consolidated power in the first place.From its origins in the 1980s as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and a rival to the secular Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Hamas morphed into a violent militant group responsible for the deaths of Israeli civilians.Initially, Israel offered discreet support to Hamas, seeing it as a useful counterweight to the PLO and its dominant faction, Fatah, led at the time by Yasser Arafat.\"The major enemy was Fatah,\" says Ami Ayalon, former head of Israel's domestic security service, Shin Bet, \"because they were the people who demanded a Palestinian state.\"But when Hamas launched deadly suicide bomb attacks in the 1990s and 2000s on Israelis, Israel responded with a series of high-profile assassinations.A violent power struggle with Fatah left Hamas, which won a 2006 election, in sole control of the Gaza Strip.Eighteen years of Hamas rule have followed, characterised by an Israeli military and economic blockade, and bouts of armed conflict in 2008-09, 2012, 2014 and 2021.Despite Israeli claims since October 2023 that \"Hamas is ISIS\", the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously convinced itself that Hamas did not pose a strategic threat.\"His was a policy of managing the conflict,\" says Mr Ayalon. \"He said we are not going to solve it and we are totally against the reality of two states, so the only way is to divide and control.\"With Hamas in control in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas, ruling in part of the occupied West Bank, the Palestinians remained hopelessly divided, enabling Israel to argue that it had no unified leadership to negotiate peace with.\"[Netanyahu] did everything in order to support Hamas in Gaza,\" Mr Ayalon says. \"He let Qatar send them… more than $1.5bn.\"Getty ImagesIsrael has gone to enormous lengths to eliminate Hamas's key political and military figuresThe money from Qatar was meant to pay the wages of civil servants and support the poorest families, but security chiefs feared it was being used for other purposes.Mr Ayalon adds: \"It was clear to the director of the Shin Bet and the head of Mossad that this money would go to military infrastructure.Netanyahu has defended allowing payments to Hamas, saying it was meant to aid the civilian population.Hamas was always preparing for warAs 7 October brutally revealed, Hamas was always preparing for war. Nowhere was this more obvious than in its elaborate network of tunnels.Tunnels had already been used to mount attacks on Israeli army positions during the second Palestinian uprising, or \"Intifada\" that began in 2000.In 2006, Hamas fighters used a tunnel under the border with Israel to attack a military post near Kerem Shalom, killing two Israel soldiers and kidnapping a third, Gilad Shalit. He was held for five years until his release, in 2011, in exchange for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners, including Yahya Sinwar, who would go on to mastermind the Hamas attacks of October 2023.Getty ImagesYahya Sinwar, one of those behind the Hamas attacks of October 2023Over time, Hamas' tunnel network expanded, to include workshops, weapons-manufacturing sites and command centres.Regional developments also played a role. In 2012, after the fall of the Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the brief rise to power of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Hamas was able to smuggle increasingly sophisticated weapons into Gaza, including sniper rifles, mobile rocket launchers and equipment for the manufacture of long-range rockets.Hamas is thought to have benefitted from the help of technicians and fighters with experience of tunnelling in places like Lebanon and Iraq.Iran was also a key supporter, seeing Hamas as a natural component in its \"Axis of Resistance,\" a loose coalition of militant groups across the Middle East with a shared antipathy towards Israel and the United States.In 2020, a US State Department report said that Iran was providing around $100m a year to Palestinian militant groups including Hamas.Yousef Masoud/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesOver time, Hamas' tunnel network expandedSome tunnels were reportedly dug as deep as 230ft (70m) below ground, took years to build and cost tens of millions of dollars each. These were designed to protect senior Hamas commanders and house long-range weapons.A local expert with extensive knowledge of the tunnels told the BBC the cost of the entire project totalled roughly $6bn (£4.5bn).Precise figures are hard to come by, but it's thought that the scattered network extended for as much as 250 miles (400km), in a strip of land just 26 miles long and, at its widest, seven miles across.Tunnels: a project shrouded in secrecyPublic discussion of the tunnels - their location or cost - could expose Gazans to accusations of espionage, leading to arrest and worse. But many knew what was happening. Local residents would see the tell-tale signs: sand and clay being removed, new entrances appearing unexpectedly and machinery being brought in under cover of darkness.What began as an opportunistic response to Gaza's isolation became, over the span of three decades, a multi-layered subterranean industrial and military complex.It emerged later that much of it was concealed under Gaza's civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, schools and, in the case of a tunnel containing a Hamas data centre, the headquarters of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza City.Anadolu via Getty ImagesAt least 67,938 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since since October 2023, according to the Hamas-run health ministryAfter 7 October 2023, when Hamas fighters stormed into Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage, it also became a massive underground prison. Not all of those held hostage were concealed in tunnels, but many were, especially as the war ground on.Eli Sharabi, who became one of the most high profile of those taken, was first moved from a safe house into a tunnel after 52 of his 491 days in captivity. \"They tied us with ropes in our legs and hands,\" he told the BBC earlier this month. \"I fainted from time to time from the pain. One time they broke my ribs.\"By the time he was released, in February, he had lost more than 30kg (4st 10lb).EPAEli Sharabi, who was held hostage, was moved from a safe house into a tunnel. 'They tied us with ropes,' he has saidHamas used the hostages as bargaining chips, to secure ceasefires or the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. As negotiations over their fate continued, Hamas drip fed the Israeli public with a cruel series of videos, often showing the hostages in situations of extreme distress.Eventually it was, says Dr Yousef, internal and external pressure that forced Hamas to abandon the strategy.\"Qatar, Egypt and Turkey and also the people here in displacement camps sent a strong message to Hamas leaders outside that enough is enough.\"Getty ImagesIsrael assassinated Hamas's powerful leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran in July 2024In the meantime, Israel continues to destroy what it can of the tunnel network, often demolishing civilian neighbourhoods above in the process.And the job is far from done.\"According to publications from the defence establishment, estimates speak of damage to between 25% and 40% of the tunnels,\" says Yehuda Kfir, an Israeli civil engineer and underground warfare researcher at Haifa's Technion University.\"No doubt [Hamas] aspires to rehabilitate the infrastructure, including restoring tunnels that were dealt with in various ways by the IDF.\"A leadership in tattersRestoring tunnels is one thing. Reconstituting the organisation is another. After the events of the past two years, Hamas' leadership is in tatters.Israel has gone to enormous lengths - in Gaza, Iran, Lebanon and Qatar - to eliminate the group's key political and military figures. From its best known, internationally recognisable leaders, travelling the world to promote their cause, to its battalion commanders on the ground in Gaza, Hamas has lost almost everyone of consequence.Israel assassinated Hamas's powerful leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran in July 2024. Three months later, Haniyeh's successor, the elusive Yahya Sinwar, was killed in the ruins of a house in Rafah.ReutersIsmail Haniyeh (left) was assassinated in Tehran in July 2024, followed three months later by his successor Yahya Sinwar (centre). Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri (right) was killed in Beirut blastDespite the loss of these leading figures - and thousands of members of its armed wing - the group battled on, recruiting a fresh generation of radicalised young fighters and splintering into small cells intent on carrying out hit-and-run guerrilla-style operations.But Hamas in October 2025 is a pale shadow of the organisation that carried out the attacks of 7 October. Today's leaders are less well known and, crucially, have little political experience.Ezzedine al-Haddad, who is 55, now heads the five-member military council that commands Hamas' armed wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades.EPA/ ShutterstockMany of the group's key political and military figures have been killed. (L-R) Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Sheikh Ahmed YassinOutside Gaza, the remnants of the group's political leadership include Khaled Meshaal (the subject of a botched Israeli assassination attempt in Jordan in 1997), Khalil al-Hayya and Muhammad Darwish.All are believed to have escaped death on 9 September, when Israeli jets attacked a building in Doha, Qatar, where they were meeting to discuss the latest US ceasefire proposals.Hamas is 'tired of war'Despite the violence still raging in Gaza, the former Hamas adviser, Ahmed Yousef, says the group is tired of war. Without mentioning 7 October directly, he describes the cause of the war as a \"terrible mistake\" and that a \"different approach\" is needed.Anadolu via Getty ImagesPeople sit among the rubble and wreckage of war in Gaza. The former Hamas adviser, Ahmed Yousef, claims Hamas is also tired of war\"I'm talking to many of them and they have said that they are not interested in ruling Gaza anymore,\" he says. \"But Hamas has more than 100,000 members and those people are not going to disappear.\"Hamas, he suggests, is looking to rebrand itself in order to continue to play a political role in the future, a process he likens to the ANC's transition from guerrilla warfare to political rule in post-apartheid South Africa.\"If tomorrow there [are] elections,\" he says, \"I'm sure Hamas will come under different names, giving the impression it is more peaceful and more willing to be part of political life. \"Violence is not going to be part of any political party.\"Dr Milshtein is doubtful.\"Even if there will be a new local regime in Gaza, of course behind the scenes Hamas will be the dominant player,\" he argues.Anadolu via Getty ImagesIsrael may have to deal with Hamas for some time to comeDisarmament, he continues, is even less likely: he predicts another Gaza war within the next five years.But Ami Ayalon, the former Shin Bet chief, believes Israel should find another way to tackle its enemy.\"Unless we defeat the ideology, they will flourish,\" he says. \"The only way to defeat the ideology is by creating and presenting to the Palestinian and the Israeli people a new horizon. A horizon of two states.\"For now, that horizon does not exist, perhaps making Dr Milshtein's prediction more likely than Ami Ayalon's vision of a shared future.But Hamas, however diminished, is far from a spent force. One way or another, Israel may have to deal with it for some time to come.Additional reporting: BBC MonitoringTop picture credit: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "He also issued Combs a $500,000 (£374,000) fine and five years of probation.Combs had asked for a 14-month sentence that would have seen him released soon after the trial ended due to time spent in jail while awaiting trial, but prosecutors sought more than 11 years.At his sentencing hearing in September, Combs told a judge: \"My actions were disgusting, shameful, and sick.\"\"I got lost in excess, I got lost in my ego,\" he said. He begged the judge for \"mercy\" and apologised to two of the women who testified against him.His legal team signalled they would appeal both Combs' conviction and the judge's sentence.Combs was arrested in September 2024 and his nearly two-month trial this summer drew international media attention.Prosecutors accused him of using his powerful position in the music industry to run what amounted to a sex trafficking operation, and coercing his girlfriends to participate in so-called \"freak-offs\" with male escorts.Much of the case centred on his relationship with the singer Cassandra Ventura, who alleged Combs physically abused her and forced her to engage in \"hotel nights\" with male escorts. Another woman, who testified under the pseudonym Jane, said she felt pressured to participate in similar encounters even if she was unwell.A jury found Combs not guilty of the two most serious charges – sex trafficking and racketeering. But they did find him guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.",

    "body": "Israel's military says the bodies of two hostages returned by Hamas on Tuesday have been identified as Aryeh Zalmanovich and Master Sergeant Tamir Adar.Mr Zalmanovich, 85 at the time of his death, was abducted from his home in kibbutz Nir Oz and killed in captivity on 17 November 2023, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement.Mr Adar, 38 when he died, was a member of Nir Oz's community security squad and was killed while fighting Hamas gunmen during the 7 October attack.The return of their remains means that Hamas has transferred 15 out of 28 deceased Israeli hostages under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal earlier this month. Their coffins were handed over to troops in the Palestinian territory by the Red Cross, which had earlier received them from Hamas. The IDF said the coffins - which were escorted by the military - had crossed into Israel and will be taken to be formally identified in Tel Aviv. Hamas has handed over a Palestinian body in a previous hostage transfers, which it said was accidental due to difficulties locating the bodies.All 20 living hostages were released shortly after the agreement was reached.Before the latest remains were identified, the IDF stressed that \"Hamas is required to uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the deceased hostages\".There has been outrage in Israel that Hamas has not yet returned all the deceased hostages. The Palestinian group says it is trying to do this but that it faces difficulty finding bodies under rubble of buildings bombed out by the IDF in Gaza.Under the ceasefire and hostage release agreement, Israel has freed 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza, and returned 15 bodies of Palestinians for every Israeli hostage's remains.The first phase of the agreement has also seen an increase of aid into Gaza, a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a halt in fighting - though deadly violence flared up over the weekend as both sides accused one another of breaching the terms of the deal.The IDF launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.More than 68,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.",

    "body": "India's capital Delhi woke up to a toxic haze as air quality worsened after the Hindu festival of Diwali, despite a court directive to use less-polluting crackers.People set off fireworks during the festival, which is also observed by Sikhs and Jains, until late on Monday, defying the court's order to use only 'green' fireworks for a limited period of time.Delhi, which has high pollution through the year due to factors including vehicular emissions and dust, had already seen air quality dipping over the past few days.On Tuesday, the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi was 360. The AQI measures the level of PM 2.5 - fine particulate matter that can clog lungs and cause a host of diseases - in the air.Levels between 101 and 200 are considered moderate, while those between 201 and 300 are \"poor\". Between 301 and 400 is categorised as \"very poor\" and a figure higher than 400 is considered \"severe\".The World Health Organization's guidelines say that exposure to PM 2.5 over a 24-hour-period should be limited to 15 micrograms per cubic metre - but Delhi's AQI in some parts is 24 times higher than the recommended level. The city's pollution problem becomes worse in winter as farmers in neighbouring states burn crop stubble. Low wind speeds also trap pollutants - such as those produced by firecrackers - in the lower atmosphere, making it hard to breathe.That's why firecrackers had been banned in Delhi and its suburbs during Diwali since 2020. However, this rule was not strictly enforced on the ground and crackers were still available for purchase in many shops, leading to its use during the festival.Last week, India's Supreme Court relaxed the blanket ban, allowing people to use so-called green crackers, which its makers say emit 20-30% less pollutants than traditional ones and generate minimal ash. Critics, however, have pointed out that even though comparatively less harmful, these crackers still release toxic substances into the air.In the run-up to Diwali, BBC reporters saw traditional crackers still being sold openly in shops. And while the court had allowed green crackers to be burst only during a limited window - one hour in the morning and two in the evening on Diwali and the day before it - the sound of fireworks could be heard well past midnight in many areas.On Tuesday, when BBC reporter Vikas Pandey left his home in Noida, a suburb of Delhi, at around 0600 local time (0030 GMT) to catch an early morning flight, he realised \"the familiar smell of burning charcoal was back\". \"The air was filled with smoke and visibility was poor. I could taste ash in my mouth. As the taxi entered Delhi, visibility became even poorer. The tall buildings which are usually visible at this hour had disappeared behind a thick veil of smog,\" he says.Experts are worried that the relaxing of rules around crackers could affect awareness around the dangers of air pollution which was being developed over the past few years.To be sure, Delhi's air quality was already in the \"very poor\" category, with AQI crossing 300, for around a week now, due to several factors such as low wind speed, vehicular emissions and stubble burning in neighbouring states. On Sunday, officials invoked the next stage of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi and its suburbs, imposing restrictions on the use of diesel generators and burning of coal and firewood in a bid to improve air quality.For now, as the familiar smog descends on Delhi, its residents appear resigned.\"You can't even think of stepping outside. The situation seems to be equally bad in densely populated areas and rural areas in Delhi today,\" said Paras Tyagi, who lives in the capital.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "South Korean police said they will seek an arrest warrant for a woman who set fire to her apartment building while trying to kill a cockroach with an improvised flamethrower, local media reports.One of the woman's neighbours died after falling to the ground in a failed attempt to escape through a window.The woman, who is in her 20s, told police that she tried to torch the cockroach with a lighter and a flammable spray, adding that she had used the method before. But on Monday, items in her home caught fire.Police in the northern city of Osan said the woman could be charged with accidentally starting a fire and causing death by negligence.Blasting cockroaches - with blowtorches or homemade flamethrowers - has emerged as a novel way of getting rid of house pests, made popular by videos on social media.In 2018, an Australian man set fire to his kitchen while trying to kill cockroaches with a homemade flamethrower made from insect spray.The woman who died in the Osan city fire, a Chinese national in her 30s, lived on the fifth floor of the building with her husband and two-month-old baby.When they realised that a fire had broken out, the couple opened their home window and called for help.They handed their baby through the window to a neighbour in the adjacent block before trying to evacuate themselves.The woman's husband managed to climb over to the next block. She tried to do the same, but fell from the window. She was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead hours later.Police said they believed the couple had tried escaping through the window because thick smoke from the fire had blocked the stairway, local media report.The building houses commercial shops on its first floor and 32 residential units from its second to fifth floor.Eight other residents suffered from smoke inhalation because of the fire.",

    "body": "The US and Australia have signed a deal intended to boost supplies of rare earths and other critical minerals, as the Trump administration looks for ways to counter China's dominance of the market. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the deal would support a pipeline of $8.5bn (A$13bn; £6.3bn) \"ready-to-go\" projects that would expand his country's mining and processing abilities. It includes $1bn to be invested by the two countries in projects in the US and Australia over the next six months, a framework text says.The US and Australia have been working on these issues since Trump's first term, but Albanese said the latest agreement would take the partnership to the \"next level\".On Monday, US President Donald Trump also commented on Australia's multi-billion dollar submarine deal with the US and UK, known as Aukus, saying it was \"full steam ahead\".Earlier this year, the deal came under the spotlight after the Trump administration said it would review the details to ensure it fit with its \"America First\" agenda, raising concerns Australia may not be able to buy US submarines to replace its ageing fleet.Asked if Australia would be getting the submarines, Trump said: \"Oh no, they're getting them\".China currently controls about 70% of rare earths mining and 90% of the processing of the materials, which are found in everything from defence equipment to computer chips and cars.US companies rely heavily on the materials, making them vulnerable this year as China has taken steps to restrict access to supplies in response to new US tariffs and other tensions.The shares in Australia rare earths mining companies jumped on Tuesday after the announcement.Perth-based firm Arafura Rare Earths surged by around 7.7%, while another major producer, Iluka Resources, gained by more than 3%.Albanese said the agreement was aimed at speeding investment in three types of projects, including US investments in processing facilities in Australia.The two countries also agreed to work together on issues such as pricing, permitting, and rules for government review of the sales of companies and projects in the sector.The US separately said it would invest in the construction of a 100 tonnes-per-year advanced gallium refinery in Western Australia and was preparing to offer some $2.2bn in financing to advance critical minerals projects via its Export-Import Bank. The Trump administration in recent months has already announced a series of investments in companies such as US rare earths miner MP Materials and Canada's Trilogy Metals and Lithium America's, which have projects in the US.In exchange for the support, it has received ownership stakes in the firms.Ahead of the meeting, shares in Australian companies such as Lynas Rare Earths had jumped on the prospect of increased support. Lynas was awarded a contract by the US Defense Department a few years ago and is working on a project in Texas.The framework published by the White House was light on details, reflecting the delicate issues at play.Australia is a major source of critical minerals but like the US, it relies on China, its biggest trade partner, for the processing required to turn the materials into something companies can use.",

    "body": "19 hours agoBasillioh Rukanga andShingai NyokaBBC AfricaA drone attack has hit an area near the international airport in Sudan's capital, Khartoum, a day before it was set to resume domestic flights for the first time since war broke out in 2023. Residents of the city reported hearing explosions in several districts early on Tuesday morning. Social media images - yet to be verified by the BBC - appear to show a series of blasts. There is no information on casualties or damage, and no-one has claimed responsibility.On Monday, Sudan's Civil Aviation Authority had announced the airport would reopen on Wednesday, months after the army recaptured Khartoum from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and began repairing the heavily damaged airport.Tuesday's strike marked the third attack in the capital within a week, following strikes on two army bases in north-west Khartoum on consecutive days last week. The Sudan Tribune news website cites a security source as saying that anti-aircraft defences had intercepted several drones after 04:00 local time (02:00 GMT) but gave no details on any damage.The international airport shut down shortly after fighting erupted between the army and the RSF in April 2023, when the paramilitary force took control of it. Sudan war: A simple guide to what is happeningSudanese city under siege: 'My son's whole body is full of shrapnel'Port Sudan, in the east, has the country's only functioning international airport, although it has been targeted by drones.Khartoum has remained relatively calm since the army retook control of the city in March, but attacks have persisted, with the RSF accused of targeting civilian and military infrastructure from a distance. Since the loss of the capital, the RSF has intensified efforts to capture el-Fasher - the army's last stronghold in the western Darfur region. The ongoing conflict has killed tens of thousands and forced millions from their homes.What started as power struggle between the army and the RSF has since drawn in other Sudanese armed groups and foreign backers, plunging the country into what the UN calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis.",

    "body": "13 hours agoLucy WilliamsonMiddle East Correspondent, JerusalemUnder Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza, the \"yellow line\" - which Israel withdrew to earlier this month - is the first of three stages of Israeli military withdrawal. It leaves it in control of about 53% of the Gaza Strip.One Israeli newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, referred to it as \"effectively the new border\" in Gaza.It's a remark that will please the far-right coalition partners of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.The fortifications and demarcations Israel is now building along this boundary are meant to clearly divide the territory, but they may also help to blur the differing hopes and expectations of Mr Netanyahu's allies in Washington and at home.How long he can keep both sets of expectations in play depends largely on this next stage of negotiations.The boundary marked by the yellow line is temporary, but further withdrawal of Israeli forces rests on resolving the difficult issues pinned to the second stage of Donald Trump's deal – including the transfer of power in Gaza and the process for disarming Hamas.Washington is keen that nothing upset this next delicate stage of negotiations. US Vice-President JD Vance flew in on Tuesday to push Netanyahu to press on with peace talks. Trump's negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner met with the Israeli PM on Monday.Israeli newspapers have been reporting that Netanyahu is receiving a stern message from his American allies to \"show restraint\" and not to endanger the ceasefire.When Israel complained that Hamas had violated the terms of the ceasefire on Sunday, killing two soldiers, the response advocated by Mr Netanyahu's far-right National Security Minister was a one-word demand: \"War\".Instead, Israel carried out an intense, but brief, wave of air strikes, before reinstating the truce, and was careful to emphasise that its troops had been attacked inside the yellow line – keen to show Washington that Israel had not broken the rules.Netanyahu has said the war will not end until Hamas is dismantled – its disarmament, and the full demilitarisation of Gaza, are among the conditions he has set.But Israeli commentators are lining up to say that the real decisions over Israel's military action in Gaza are now being made in Washington.The yellow line – and the daunting task facing negotiators in this second stage of the deal – are clues as to why Netanyahu's coalition partners have chosen to wait, rather than carry out a threat to bring down his government.The dream for many extremist settlers – and ministers – is that the next stage of this process will prove impossible to resolve and the yellow line will indeed become the de facto border, opening the way to new settlements on Gazan land. Some hardliners would like Israel to annex the whole of the Gaza Strip.The vast majority of Israelis want an end to the war and for the remaining bodies of the hostages, and Israel's serving soldiers, to come home.But Israel's prime minister is known as a politician who likes to keep his options as open as possible, for as long as possible, and this is a deal in stages, with caveats built in.Agreeing to this first stage meant withdrawing to positions that left Israel in control of more than half of Gaza, and agreeing to a ceasefire in order to get hostages home.From here, it will become harder to align the goals of his US and domestic allies.Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly underlined that violations of the deal by Hamas – including its failure to disarm – would allow Israel to return to war.\"If this is achieved the easy way, so much the better,\" he told the Israeli public earlier this month. \"If not, it will be achieved the hard way.\"Donald Trump has said the same.  But Washington has so far shown a tolerance for delays and violations in implementing the deal on the ground, leaving Netanyahu with far less political room than perhaps he'd like.",

    "body": "Belize has signed an agreement to act as a \"safe third country\" for migrants as they seek asylum in the United States.The small Central American nation's Prime Minister John Antonio Briceño said the deal - which still needs approval from the Belize Senate - will mean that migrants deported from the US could apply for asylum there instead of returning to their home countries.The US State Department called it \"an important milestone in ending illegal immigration\" and \"shutting down abuse\" of the US asylum system.The agreement appears to be similar to one with Paraguay announced in August.This year Panama, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras have also taken in people deported by the US.Human rights groups in the US and abroad have strongly criticised such deals, saying migrants face the risk of being sent to countries where they could be harmed.Belize's Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted on social media that the agreement \"includes strict security measures to protect Belize's national security and sovereignty\".\"The agreement gives Belize full authority to approve or reject transfers, limits eligibility to specific nationalities, and ensures comprehensive background checks, among other measures,\" it said.Briceño told local media that for Belize it will be \"more like a job programme, whereby people with certain qualifications can come to Belize\" and \"participate meaningfully in our economy\".He added that the country - which has a population of 417,000 - would prefer to take people from Central America, adding \"we're not going to open up to the whole world\".But opposition leader Tracy Taegar Panton expressed \"grave concern\" about the deal, saying it \"could reshape Belize's immigration and asylum systems, impose new financial burdens on taxpayers, and raise serious questions about national sovereignty and security\".The US State Department posted on X that the agreement was \"an important milestone in ending illegal immigration, shutting down abuse of our nation's asylum system, and reinforcing our shared commitment to tackling challenges in our hemisphere together\". Further details of the agreement have not yet been released.Since the start of his second term, US President Donald Trump has embarked on sweeping efforts to remove undocumented migrants - a key election promise that drew mass support during his campaign.In June, the US Supreme Court cleared the way for Trump to resume deportations of migrants to countries other than their homeland without giving them the chance to raise any risks they might face with officials.

    "body": "15 hours agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and eastern Europe correspondent andGabriela PomeroyA man who shot and seriously injured Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico in an attack last year has been sentenced to 21 years in prison after being found guilty of terrorism.Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old pensioner, fired five shots at the prime minister in May 2024 when he was on a visit to the town of Handlova, about 180km (112 miles) north-east of the capital, Bratislava.The gunman shot Fico at extremely close range, just as he was reaching out to shake his hand - thinking he was a supporter. In court, Cintula denied trying to kill the prime minister, saying he had deliberately aimed away from his vital organs.Footage from the scene of the shooting showed a man raising a gun and firing at the prime minister before being subdued by bodyguards. Other members of Fico's security team rushed him into his car.The prime minister was seriously injured in his abdomen and was airlifted by helicopter to a nearby hospital for surgery, with his condition described as life-threatening. He later recovered and returned to public appearances.On Tuesday, Cintula was sentenced on terror charges, with Judge Igor Kralik stating: \"The court considers proven that the defendant did not attack a citizen but specifically the prime minister.\"The gunman's lawyer had attempted to reduce the charge to attacking a public official, which has a lower penalty, but this was rejected by the judge.Cintula's lawyer said he would likely appeal the verdict.The attacker, an amateur poet, claimed he only wanted to injure Fico in order to stop policies he believed were harming Slovakia.Following the shooting, Cintula said he objected to Fico's nationalist government, including its decision to suspend military aid to Ukraine as Slovakia's neighbour fends off a Russian invasion.The 61-year-old prime minister has tried to blame the opposition for the attack and for whipping up hatred, though he is known for deeply divisive rhetoric himself.Fico, seen by many European leaders as an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, in January accused the opposition of planning a coup in Slovakia - a claim rejected by his opponents.In recent months, tens of thousands of Slovaks have protested against what they describe as the government's curtailing of the rule of law and media freedom - allegations Fico's government denies.At the end of September, Fico's ruling coalition spearheaded changes to Slovakia's constitution so it recognises only two sexes, restricts adoption to married heterosexual couples and prohibits surrogate pregnancies.",

    "body": "15 hours agoShaimaa KhalilJapan correspondentWatch: Moment Sanae Takaichi wins Japan's lower houseFor many young girls in Japan today, the image of Sanae Takaichi taking the helm of power as the country's first ever female leader is powerful and formative.It means a patriarchal society and a political system that has long been dominated by men is now led by a woman.But while the optics speak of a progressive moment, some women don't see her as an advocate for change.\"It was quite interesting to see how people outside Japan have reacted to the news.\" Ayda Ogura, 21, says.\"Everyone's like, 'wow, she's the first female prime minister in Japanese history and that would be a great opportunity for women empowerment and gender equality in Japan'.\"I think that's a very naive interpretation.\"Instead, Ms Ogura points to her \"political beliefs and what she stands for\", adding: \"She perpetuates the patriarchal system.\"Ayda Ogura, 21, warns this may not be the moment for gender equality in Japan some thinkA big fan of Margaret Thatcher, Britain's first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi has always wanted to be the \"Iron Lady\" of her country.And like Thatcher, Takaichi is a staunch conservative.Observers say her leadership is a tactical move from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to appeal to the more conservative base which had recently gravitated towards Japan's parties further to the right.Takaichi opposes same-sex marriage and has long stood against legislation that would allow married couples to have separate surnames, preventing many women from keeping their maiden names.She's also against women being in line for succession in the imperial family.However, she did soften some of her messaging during her campaign - saying she favours giving tax incentives to companies that provide childcare facilities to their employees and spoke of possible tax breaks for families spending on childcare.But she has over the years backed the idea of a more traditional role for women in society and in the family.When it comes to women's issues, Takaichi is consistent with her country's less than impressive record on gender issues.Japanese women are among the best educated and highest qualified in the world and yet they struggle with the expectations of a conservative society that still pushes them in traditional roles.According to the 2025 gender gap index by the World Economic Forum, Japan ranked 118th among 148 countries, with female representation in the field of politics notably low.Leadership positions have traditionally been dominated by men and Japan has struggled to increase the number of female lawmakers and business leaders.The world's fourth largest economy ranks last among the G7 countries when it comes to the share of women in its national parliament.  Specifically, women make up about 15.7% of lawmakers in Japan, the lowest figure among the G7.It is even slow when it comes to women's reproductive health: only this week was it announced that the \"morning after\" pill - a form of emergency contraception available without prescription in more than 90 countries - had finally been approved for over the counter use in Japan.Even so, some see Takaichi's rise to power as a pivotal moment that could change how women view their prospects.\"There is great significance in Ms Takaichi becoming prime minister, with a broader impact on society,\" Naomi Koshi - who became the country's youngest female mayor in 2012 - told Japan's Kyodo news agency.Koshi argued Japan having a female prime minister will \"lower psychological barriers\" for women and girls, helping them feel it is normal to \"stand out\" as leaders in companies and society, even as gender-based stereotypes and expectations still remain.But Audrey Hill-Uekawa, 20, points out that, while it is remarkable Japan has its first female leader, one must remember it took her more than 30 years to get to that position.\"She's also not really going against the grain. She's saying the same thing as the men.\" Audrey Hill-Uekawa, 20, says the new prime minister's views don't differ much from the men who have gone beforeMs Hill-Uekawa adds that she shouldn't be put on a pedestal simply because she is a woman.\"We need to make sure we're talking about her policies. We need to be able to criticise her equally as everyone else.\"It is not just what Takaichi has said which has led people to label her as a defender of the patriarchy.It's also evident by who her champions inside the party have been.She's the protégé of the late former hawkish prime minister Shinzo Abe, and was backed in the leadership election by Taro Aso - a senior figure in the LDP at the head of one of the ruling party's most influential conservative blocs.His faction's support for Sanae Takaichi was pivotal in uniting the party's right wing behind her.\"I do feel that it is difficult for women to sort of relate to her success because it furthers this idea that we must be compliant with the status quo,\" 21-year-old Minori Konishi says.Ms Ogura agrees, saying that with her as a figurehead for women in politics, \"people are going to expect the same from us as well\".\"They're going to expect us to be compliant, not go against the ideals that they have, and it might make our job more difficult.\"Making history, however, was just the first of the challenges Takaichi will face - not least tackling a sluggish economy and inflation and winning back the trust of a frustrated and angry electorate, as well as hosting president Trump within days of taking power.It's safe to say that no-one expects gender equality issues to be high on her priority list.",

    "body": "11 hours agoJohn Sudworthin KyivReutersRussia has stepped up attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, leading to frequent blackoutsThe Ukrainian city of Chernihiv is in total blackout following what the authorities describe as a \"massive\" assault by Russian missiles and drones, with hundreds of thousands of people affected.Across the wider Chernihiv region, four people are reported to have been killed as residential neighbourhoods were struck in the town of Novhorod-Siverskyi.Ten others were injured, including a 10-year-old girl.The country's most northerly region is the latest to be hit in an intensifying series of attacks on civilian infrastructure as Russia targets energy supplies, the rail network, homes and businesses in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\"I personally heard the drones flying overhead,\" 55-year-old Oleksandr Babich said.The Chernihiv city resident spoke in matter-of-fact terms about a night filled with the low whine of Iranian-designed Shahed drones, a sound now being increasingly heard far from the war's front lines.\"Unfortunately, our region is very close to our scheming neighbour,\" he said, adding an expletive for good measure.The Chernihiv region shares a border with both Russia and Belarus, giving the air defences here less time to react to any incoming attacks.In a raid involving more than 100 Shahed drones - each of which carry a 50kg warhead - and six ballistic missiles, the direct strikes on Chernihiv's electricity generating facilities left the whole city without power, as well as large parts of the surrounding area.Andriy Podorvan, the deputy head of the Chernihiv Regional Military Administration, told the BBC that it was part of a pattern across much of the country, with things getting much worse in recent months.\"For around half a year we have been experiencing targeted strikes on the energy infrastructure in our region,\" he said.\"The number of attacks has significantly increased over the last two months.\"When I asked him if he believed that any of the targets were of military value - Moscow's usual justification for these sorts of attacks - he pointed out that Russia has even been targeting petrol stations.\"I can only see strikes on civilian infrastructure,\" he said.The attack on the electricity grid has also meant the loss of power to water pumping stations, seriously impacting supplies. Residents have been told to stock up on bottled water or are having to rely on emergency deliveries.ReutersResidents of Chernihiv have been left without water supplies in their homesWith the attacks ongoing in the morning, electrical engineers had to delay their initial response - but were later able to begin working to restore power.The wider concern is that, if the intensity of Russia's bombardment continues, it risks rapidly depleting the country's energy resilience, taking a heavy toll on the economy and - with a harsh winter ahead - dealing a psychological blow to the public too.Up until now, the country's generating companies - working together in a war-time spirit of co-operation - have been able to restore power relatively quickly, but stocks of replacement equipment are not unlimited.A single transformer can take more than a year to produce, with added time for transportation and installation.The country is having to look for all the help it can get.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's recent meeting with US President Donald Trump in Washington may have been seen as a strategic disappointment, coming away without having secured a supply of long-hoped for long-range Tomahawk missiles.But his meetings with the heads of leading US energy companies, in which they discussed ways of helping Ukraine to shore up and modernise its energy sector, were reportedly a success.Some estimates put the total cost of the damage to Ukraine's energy infrastructure so far at more than $16bn (€13.7bn; £11.9bn).Oleksandr Babich said morale amongst Ukrainian citizens was high despite the Russian attacksIn Chernihiv, the regional official Andriy Podorvan told the BBC that he believes Russia is unable to make any significant progress on the front lines and so now sees the civilian population as a weak point.But he thinks this is misjudged.\"People understand who the enemy is and who is guilty in this situation,\" he said. \"It will lead to the even greater unity of the population.\"Mr Babich agrees.\"Although, yes, there are inconveniences, the majority of the population is ready for this,\" he insisted.Many have been going to work as normal, he pointed out, with back-up generators in place for important facilities like hospitals and government buildings, and neighbours are helping each other.\"The hero city of Chernihiv did not give up and is not going to give up. Morale is high.\"",

The Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) said the online description and categorisation of the dolls \"makes it difficult to doubt the child pornography nature of the content\".Shein later told the BBC: \"The products in question were immediately delisted as soon as we became aware of these serious issues.\"It said its team was \"investigating how these listings circumvented our screening measures\". Shein is also \"conducting a comprehensive review to identify and remove any similar items that may be listed on our marketplace by other third-party vendors\".The DGCCRF has reported Shein to French prosecutors as well as Arcom, the country's online and broadcasting regulator, according to French media.The news has emerged just days before Shein is set to open its first permanent physical shop anywhere in the world - in a Parisian department store.",

    "body": "The Kenyan government has confirmed that 21 people have died following a landslide in the western part of the country after heavy rainfall. Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen said the bodies had been transferred to a nearby airstrip after the landslide in Marakwet East late on Friday night.He said on X that more than 30 people were still unaccounted for after being reported missing by their families while 25 people with serious injuries had been airlifted to receive further medical attention.The Kenyan Red Cross, which is helping to coordinate rescue efforts, said that the most affected areas are still not accessible by road due to mudslides and flash flooding. The Kenyan government paused the search and rescue operation on Saturday evening but said it would resume on Sunday.\"Preparation to supply more food and non-food relief items to the victims is underway,\" said Murkomen, adding: \"Military and police choppers are on standby to transport the items.\"Kenya is in its second rainy season when it usually experiences a few weeks of wet weather compared to a heavier, more prolonged period earlier in the year. The government has urged people living near seasonal rivers as well as areas that experienced landslides on Friday to move to safer ground.Meanwhile, flash flooding and landslides in Uganda, near the border with Kenya, have killed a number of people since last Wednesday.On Saturday, the Uganda Red Cross said another mudslide had occurred in Kapsomo village in the east of the country, destroying a house and killing four people inside. The Red Cross said floods had severely affected most villages near riverbanks in the Bulambuli District. It said continuous heavy rainfall had caused the River Astiri and the River Sipi \"to overflow, resulting in widespread destruction of homes, crop fields, and community infrastructure\".",

    "body": "US judges say Trump administration must continue food aid during shutdown 8 hours agoJessica MurphyUniversal Images Group via Getty ImagesThe Trump administration cannot suspend food aid used by about 42 million low-income Americans during the US government shutdown, two federal judges have ruled. The rulings said the government must pay for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) benefits using emergency funds.Responding on social media, President Donald Trump said he has instructed government lawyers to ask the courts how the administration could legally fund SNAP.\"Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed,\" Trump said.The US Department of Agriculture's website says it will not distribute food assistance funds in November due to the shutdown, saying \"the well has run dry\". The Snap programme works by giving people reloadable debit cards that they can use to buy essential grocery items. A family of four on average receives $715 (£540) per month, which breaks down to a little less than $6 (£4.50) per day, per person.The states administer the benefits, using money from the federal government, which has been unfunded and shut down since 1 October. Several states have pledged to use their own funds to cover any shortfall, however the federal government has warned that they will not be reimbursed.Dozens of US states sued the Trump administration over its plans to halt funding, hoping to force it to use a roughly $6bn (£4.5bn) emergency contingency fund for Snap, also known as food stamps.Writing on Truth Social on Friday, President Trump said: \"If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding\".Massachusetts US District Judge Indira Talwani wrote in her decision that the  states who sued are likely to win in court on their claim that \"Congress intended the funding of SNAP benefits, at a reduced rate if necessary, when appropriated funds prove insufficient\".The Massachusetts judge said the administration must access the contingency funding to pay the benefits and had until Monday to report back to the court on whether they will authorise at least partial benefits for November.Judge Talwani also wrote that the Trump administration \"erred in concluding\" that the USDA is blocked by law from tapping the emergency reserves in the contingency fund when there is a lapse in federal funding.The USDA had said those reserves were insufficient to pay full benefits, which cost $8.5bn to $9bn each month. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins had said she would only use the fund for an emergency such as a natural disaster.Even if the government turns to the contingency fund, it would only be able to cover about 60% of beneficiaries in a single month, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a think-tank focused on policies that help low-income families.Judge Talwani also asked the administration to report on Monday whether it will use the fund to pay reduced benefits or if it will pay full benefits for the month by moving money from other programmes, similar to the administration transferring military research funds earlier this month to pay members of the armed forces.In a separate ruling, Rhode Island federal judge John J McConnell Jr ordered the Trump administration to make full Snap benefit payments by 3 November.The judge says the contingency fund - in addition to a separate $23bn fund created the Agricultural Adjustment Act amendments of 1935 - could be used to make full payments.If the government chooses not to use these other funds, Judge McConnell Jr ruled the government has to make a partial payment using the total amount of the contingency funds by 5 November.Separately in Rhode Island, a lawsuit was brought by a number of US cities and NGOs who sued over what they called the \"unlawful suspension\" of the programme.\"There is no doubt and it is beyond argument that irreparable harm will begin to occur if it hasn't already occurred in the terror it has caused some people about the availability of funding for food, for their family,\" US  District Judge John McConnell said.The USDA did not comment on the decisions. The BBC has also contacted the Office of Management and Budget for comment.At a news conference before the rulings were issued, Rollins said \"we're looking at all the options\" when asked whether the administration would comply if courts required it to release funds. On Friday, the group behind the lawsuit filed in Rhode Island said that the ruling \"is a lifeline for millions of families, seniors, and veterans who depend on SNAP to put food on the table\".\"It reaffirms a fundamental principle: no administration can use hunger as a political weapon.\"Republicans and Democrats have traded blame for the federal shutdown, which will soon enter its second month, and there has not been any meaningful progress toward a deal.",

What lead to the hotel fire disaster?Dozens killed as fire engulfs Turkish ski hotelIn addition, 137 people were injured in the blaze at the northern mountain resort of Kartalkaya. Hilmi Altin, who lost his wife and nine-year-old daughter, told AFP news agency: \"I go to the cemetery each day. No psychologist can ease such a pain.\"An inquiry found that some safety equipment had not worked at the time of the fire, which started in the hotel's restaurant. Also, some of the building's gas equipment did not meet safety standards.Ergul denied responsibility. He said the hotel had regular inspections and blamed the gas supplier. He also said the tourism ministry was responsible for oversight.\"If I had foreseen the risk, I would have closed the hotel myself,\" he told the hearing which took place inside a specially constructed court room at a local school. A further 18 defendants received sentences ranging from 12 to 22 years. Most were hotel employees. Others were acquitted, including two cooks.The Bolu mountains are popular with skiers from Istanbul and Turkey's capital Ankara, which is about 170km (105 miles) away. At the time of the disaster, the hotel was operating at high occupancy as it was the start of school holidays.",

    "body": "Beijing has said it will loosen a chip export ban it imposed after Dutch authorities took over Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands.In September, the Netherlands invoked a Cold War-era law to take control of Nexperia, stating \"serious governance shortcomings\" which could impact the availability of chips - which are critical for making cars - in an emergency.China said in response that it would not re-export Nexperia chips completed in its Chinese factories to Europe. Last month, the likes of Volvo Cars and Volkswagen warned it could lead to temporary shutdowns at their plants. On Saturday, Beijing said it would consider exempting individual firms from the ban.  Around 70% of Nexperia chips made in Europe are sent to China to be completed and re-exported to other countries. On Saturday, the Chinese government said: \"We will comprehensively consider the actual situation of enterprises and grant exemptions to exports that meet the criteria.\" It did not elaborate on what that criteria is, but criticised \"the Dutch government's improper intervention in the internal affairs of enterprises\" which, it said, led to \"the current chaos in the global supply chain\".Last week, in a letter seen by the Reuters news agency, Nexperia told customers it would stop sending chips to China to be processed. It said it was developing \"alternative solutions to ensure supply continuity\" for customers. Nexperia is headquartered in the Netherlands but owned by Wingtech, a company backed by the Chinese government, which acquired the Dutch business in 2018.In October, Zhang Xuezheng, Nexperia's chief executive and the founder of Wingtech, was ousted as the firm's boss after a Dutch court suspended him as a director.The Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs said at the time it was concerned about \"serious managerial shortcomings\" under his leadership and \"observed that Nexperia's operations in Europe were being compromised in an unacceptable manner\". Last month, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) had warned Nexperia chip supplies would only last a few weeks unless the Chinese ban was lifted.\"Without these chips, European automotive suppliers cannot build the parts and components needed to supply vehicle manufacturers and this therefore threatens production stoppages,\" the group said.The latest plans by Beijing to relax its export controls have emerged after US President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping met in South Korea earlier this week.Trump later said the leaders discussed chips, while Beijing's post-meeting readout did not explicitly mention any area of trade.The White House is expected to release a fact sheet later on Saturday detailing its new trade agreement with China.In December 2024, the US government placed Chinese chip manufacturer Wingtech on its so-called \"entity list\", identifying the company as a national security concern.In the UK, Nexperia was forced to sell its silicon chip plant in Newport after MPs and ministers expressed national security concerns. It currently owns a UK facility in Stockport.",

    "body": "Six suspects have been arrested near the French city of Lyon in connection with the country's latest brazen heist.Thieves used explosives to break into a precious metals refinery on Thursday before making off with the loot, which was mostly gold and worth €12m (£10.5m, $13.8m).Following a chase, police caught the suspects and recovered the haul, officials said. The heist came after five more people were arrested over a theft at the Louvre Museum in Paris earlier this month.In the Lyon incident, footage posted on social media by people living near the facility showed two men near a white van. One could be seen placing a ladder over the company's fence before scaling it.Another video showed a robber carrying a weapon and opening the rear door of the van, while another loaded briefcases into the vehicle.An unnamed neighbour told AFP news agency she heard a big explosion. \"It was really impressive,\" she said.Five employees of the firm Pourquery Laboratories suffered minor injuries in the explosion, officials told AFP.A woman was among those detained after the chase. Assault rifles and explosives were also seized, police said. Meanwhile, the latest arrests over the Louvre heist in Paris bring the number of those detained to seven.On 19 October, four suspects used a mechanical lift to gain access to the museum's Gallery of Apollo in broad daylight. They cracked open display cases housing crown jewels with a disc cutter and made off with items worth €88m (£76m; $102m).Police say those arrested include three of the thieves. Officers are still hunting the fourth.",

    "body": "8 hours agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondent, in KyivUkraine's top military commander has admitted his soldiers are facing \"difficult conditions\" defending Pokrovsk - a key eastern front-line town - against massed Russian forces.Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Ukrainian troops were facing a \"multi-thousand enemy\" force - but denied Russian claims that they were surrounded or blocked.He confirmed that elite special forces had been deployed to protect key supply lines which, army sources said, were all under Russian fire.The defence ministry in Moscow reported that Ukrainian troops were surrendering and 11 of their special forces had been killed after landing by helicopter, something denied by Kyiv.In Saturday's posts on Telegram, Gen Syrskyi said he was \"back on the front\" to personally hear the latest reports from military commanders on the ground in the eastern Donetsk region.In a short video, Syrskyi is seen studying battlefield maps with other commanders, including the head of Ukraine's military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov.It is unclear when and where the footage was recorded.Ukrainian media earlier reported that Budanov was in the region to personally oversee the operation by the special forces.The deployment of special forces suggests officials in Kyiv are determined to try to hold on to the town, which Russia has been trying to seize for more than a year.Ukraine's 7th Rapid Response Corps said on Saturday Ukrainian troops \"have improved [their] tactical position\" in Pokrovsk - but the situation remained \"difficult and dynamic\".Late on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stressed that the defence of Pokrovsk was a \"priority\".There have been growing reports of Russian advances around the strategic town to the west of the Russian-seized regional capital of Donetsk. Images shared with news agencies late on Friday appear to show a Ukrainian Black Hawk helicopter deploying about 10 troops near Pokrovsk, although the location and date could not be verified.Russia's defence ministry said it had thwarted the deployment of Ukrainian military intelligence special forces north-west of the town, killing all 11 troops who landed by helicopter.DeepState, a Ukrainian open-source monitoring group, estimates about half of Pokrovsk is a so-called \"grey zone\" where neither side is in full control.A military source in Donetsk told the BBC that Ukrainian forces were not surrounded but their supply lines were under fire from Russian troops.The US-based Institute for the Study of War said Ukrainian forces had \"marginally advanced\" during recent counter-attacks north of Pokrovsk, but said the town was \"mainly a contested 'grey zone'\".Moscow wants Kyiv to cede the Donetsk and the neighbouring Luhansk regions (collectively known as Donbas) as part of a peace deal, including the parts it currently does not control.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula Moscow annexed in 2014.Pokrovsk is a key transport and supply hub whose capture could unlock Russian efforts to seize the rest of the region.But Kyiv also believes its capture would help Russia in its efforts to persuade the US that its military campaign is succeeding - and, therefore, that the West should acquiesce to its demands.Washington has grown increasingly frustrated with the Kremlin's failure to move forward with peace negotiations - culminating in US President Donald Trump placing sanctions on two largest Russian oil producers and axing plans for a summit with President Vladimir Putin.Zelensky has publicly agreed with Trump's proposal for a ceasefire that would freeze the war along the current front lines. Putin is refusing to do so, insisting on his maximalist pre-invasion demands that Kyiv and its Western allies see as a de facto capitulation of Ukraine.Additional reporting by Jaroslav Lukiv",

    "body": "2 days agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorSt Stephen's CathedralThe skull was returned to the cathedral in a cardboard box and accompanied by a letter\"It's not something you expect,\" says Franz Zehetner, who opened a parcel addressed to Vienna's St Stephen's Cathedral to discover a skull inside.The cathedral archivist admits to being taken aback by the package, but alongside the skull was a letter of explanation.A man in northern Germany said he had stolen the skull as a young tourist about 60 years before and now wanted to hand it back.He had taken it while on a guided tour of the catacombs beneath St Stephen's which contain the remains of about 11,000 people buried during the 18th Century.In his letter, the tourist with the guilty conscience described how he wanted to make  peace with himself as he came towards the end of his life.\"After his clarification of the matter, it was touching that someone would wish to make amends for an act of youthful exuberance,\" Franz Zehetner told the BBC. \"Also that he had carefully preserved the skull over the years - even it was not according to the rules - instead of carelessly getting rid of it.\"It is unclear whose skull the tourist had taken home with him all those years ago, and it has now been re-interred.Although many of the remains date back to a 40-year period in the 18th Century, members of high-ranking Viennese families were also buried beneath the Cathedral earlier.",

    "body": "Shares worth €1.3bn (£1.1bn; $1.5bn) have been seized from the company that controls the manufacturer of Campari over alleged tax evasion, Italian police have said.Officials ordered the confiscation of the Campari Group shares from Luxembourg-based Lagfin as part of a year-long investigation into how it absorbed its Italian arm.It is accused of failing to pay a similar figure to that of the shares seized in taxes during that merger. The company said it had always acted according to tax laws.Campari - which also produces alcohol brands including Aperol, Grand Marnier and Courvoisier - said neither it nor its subsidiaries were involved in the case. However, chair Luca Garavoglia is among those under investigation, local media reports.Lagfin - which owns more than 50% of Campari shares and has 80% of voting rights - told the BBC in a statement that it had \"always acted in the most scrupulous respect of any applicable laws and regulations, including any Italian tax laws\".Prosecutors in Milan launched a probe into the company last year. Financial police said on Friday that they allegedly found €5.3bn of undeclared capital gains between 2018 and 2020 on which it had not paid a so-called \"exit tax\", levied on firms that transfer their headquarters abroad.It is also accused of transferring its Italian assets into foreign ownership solely for tax purposes, according to Italian financial newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore.Mr Garavoglia, the billionaire who inherited ownership of Campari from his late mother, is implicated alongside Giovanni Berto, the head of Campari's Italian branch, local media reports.Lagfin said it will \"defend itself vigorously\" in the matter, which it characterised as a \"tax dispute\".The company stressed that Campari had never been involved \"in any manner whatsoever\" in the matter, adding that, as it held 80% of Campari's voting rights, the seizure was \"absolutely unable to affect the position of Lagfin as controlling shareholder of Campari\".One of the largest global producers of spirits, Campari is valued at around €7bn on the Milan Stock Exchange.The company has its roots in 1860, when Gaspare Campari's homemade bitter liqueur became a popular tipple among patrons of his Milan bar. It became so successful that, in 1904, his family began manufacturing it commercially, and from the 1990s onwards the firm began acquiring other alcohol brands.",

    "body": "French actor Tchéky Karyo, who had a starring role in the film Nikita and the TV series The Missing, has died aged 72.Karyo, who was born in Turkey but grew up in Paris, died of a cancer on Friday, AFP news agency reported. Known largely for supporting roles, Karyo acted in films for nearly four decades, finding a second career in TV series in his final years.Karyo's wife, actress Valérie Keruzoré, and their children announced his death in a statement to the news agency. Karyo first made his mark in crime thriller La Balance (1982) and he played the handler Bob in Luc Besson's assassin film Nikita (1990).BBC audiences might best remember him for his role in The Missing (2014).The first eight-part series, about the search for a missing boy in France, starred Karyo as French detective Julien Baptiste. James Nesbitt and Frances O'Connor played the boy's parents.The second eight-part series, about a missing girl in Germany, was brodcast in 2016. Karyo returned as Baptiste, with David Morrissey and Keeley Hawes as the girl's parents.Both series received positive reviews, with critics praising the cast, especially Karyo's performance. In February 2019, a spin-off series titled Baptiste was broadcast on BBC One. Lindsay Salt, Director of BBC Drama, said: \"We are so sad to learn of the passing of Tchéky Karyo. He was a truly brilliant and much loved actor and he will be fondly remembered by BBC viewers for his roles in The Missing, Baptiste and most recently Boat Story. Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones at this time.\"Karyo was born on 4 October 1953 in Istanbul, the son of a Turkish lorry driver of Spanish-Jewish origin and a Greek mother, Le Monde newspaper writes.After several years as a theatrical actor, he saw his role in La Balance earn him a nomination for the César Award for Best Male Revelation.With his strong jaw and penetrating stare, he went on to star in dozens of films of all kinds. Other French films included Besson's Joan of Arc (1993) and the anti-war epic A Very Long Engagement (2004). He was also cast in Ridley Scott's 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992) and in the James Bond film GoldenEye (1995).One of his starring roles was as the medieval prophet Nostradamus in the 1994 film of the same name, while his tiniest role was undoubtedly in Amélie (2001) where he only appeared as a face on an ID photograph in an album.",

    "body": "11 hours agoCachella Smith and Will Grant,Reporting from KingstonA chartered flight from the UK government is set to depart Jamaica on Saturday evacuating British nationals from the country in the wake of Hurricane Melissa.The flight, set to leave from Kingston's Norman Manley International Airport, comes after the UK flew aid in earlier in the day as part of a £7.5m regional emergency package.Some of the funding will be used to match public donations up to £1m to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent - with King Charles and Queen Camilla among those who have donated.Despite aid arriving in Jamaica in recent days, blocked roads have complicated distribution after Hurricane Melissa devastated parts of the island, killing at least 19 people.The hurricane made landfall in Jamaica on Tuesday as a category five storm and was one of the most powerful hurricanes ever measured in the Caribbean.Melissa swept across the region over a number of days and left behind a trail of destruction and dozens of people dead. In Haiti, at least 30 people were killed, while Cuba also saw flooding and landslides.Jamaica's Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon said on Friday \"there are entire communities that seem to be marooned and areas that seem to be flattened\".Around 8,000 British nationals were thought to have been on the island when the hurricane hit.The UK foreign office has asked citizens there to register their presence and also advises travellers to contact their airline to check whether commercial options are available.The UK initially set aside a £2.5m immediate financial support package for the region, with an additional £5m announced by Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper on Friday.Cooper said the announcement came as \"more information is now coming through on the scale of devastation caused by Hurricane Melissa, with homes damaged, roads blocks and lives lost\".The British Red Cross said the King and Queen's donation would help the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) \"continue its lifesaving work\" - which includes search and rescue efforts in Jamaica as well as ensuring access to healthcare, safe shelter and clean water.The Red Cross said that 72% of people across Jamaica still do not have electricity and around 6,000 are in emergency shelters.Until the Jamaican government can get the broken electricity grid back up and running, any generators aid agencies can distribute will be vital. So too will tarpaulins, given the extent of the housing crisis.Meanwhile, with so many in need of clean drinking water and basic food, patience is wearing thin and there are more reports of desperate people entering supermarkets to gather and give out whatever food they can find.The BBC has seen queues for petrol pumps, with people waiting for hours to then be told there is no fuel left when they reach the front of the queue.Some people are seeking fuel for generators, others for a car to reach an area in which they can contact people, with the power down across most of the island.The country's health minister, Dr Christopher Tufton, on Saturday described \"significant damage\" across a number of hospitals - with the Black River Hospital in St Elizabeth being the most severely affected.\"That facility will have to be for now totally relocated in terms of services,\" he said.\"The immediate challenge of the impacted hospitals is to preserve accident and emergency services,\" Dr Tufton added. \"What we're seeing is that a lot of people are coming in now to these facilities with trauma-related [injuries] from falls from the roof, to ladders, to nails penetrating their feet\".The minister said arrangements had been made for the ongoing supply of fuel to the facilities as well as a \"daily supply of water\".Although aid is entering the country, landslides, downed power lines and fallen trees have made certain roads impassable. However, some of the worst affected areas of Jamaica should finally receive some relief in the coming hours.At least one aid organisation, Global Empowerment Mission, rolled out this morning from Kingston with a seven-truck convoy to Black River, the badly damaged town of western Jamaica, carrying packs of humanitarian assistance put together by volunteers from the Jamaican diaspora community in Florida. Help is also coming in from other aid groups and foreign governments via helicopter.It remains only a small part of what the affected communities need but authorities insist more is coming soon.",

    "body": "President Samia Suluhu Hassan has been declared the winner of Tanzania's presidential election, securing another term amid days of unrest across the country.Samia won 98% of the votes in Wednesday's poll, the electoral commission said. In her Saturday victory speech she said the election was \"free and democratic\", accusing protesters of being \"unpatriotic\".Opposition parties rejected the results,  calling the vote a mockery of the democratic process as Samia's main challengers had been either imprisoned or barred from running.International observers have expressed concern over the lack of transparency and widespread turmoil that has reportedly left hundreds of people dead and injured.The nationwide internet shutdown is making it difficult to verify the death toll.The government has sought to play down the scale of the violence - and authorities have extended a curfew in a bid to quell the unrest.Receiving her victory certificate on Saturday, Samia, 65, said: \"We thank the security forces for ensuring that the violence did not stop voting. \"The government strongly condemns the violent incidents. These incidents were not patriotic at all,\" she said.Earlier on Saturday, electoral commission chief Jacobs Mwambegele declared Samia \"the winner of the presidential election\".Samia secured about 31.9 million votes, or 97.66% of the total, with turnout nearing 87% of the country's 37.6 million registered voters, the electoral chief said. In Tanzania's semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar - which elects its own government and leader - CCM's Hussein Mwinyi, who is the incumbent president, won with nearly 80% of the vote.The opposition in Zanzibar said there had been \"massive fraud\", the AP news agency reported.Mwinyi's swearing-in ceremony is under way at Amaan Complex stadium in Zanzibar. Why elections are a time of fear for albino TanzaniansNo protests were reported on Saturday morning, but tension remained high in Dar es Salaam, where security forces manned roadblocks across the port city.On Friday demonstrators Dar es Salaam and other cities took to the streets, tearing down Samia's posters and attacking police and polling stations despite warnings from the army chief to end the unrest.The demonstrations are mostly led by young protesters, who have denounced the election as unfair.They accuse the government of undermining democracy by suppressing the main opposition leaders - one is in jail and another was excluded on technical grounds.A spokesperson from the opposition Chadema party on Friday told AFP news agency that \"around 700\" people had been killed in clashes with security forces, while a diplomatic source in Tanzania told the BBC there was credible evidence that at least 500 people had died.Foreign Minister Mahmoud Kombo Thabit has described the violence as a \"few isolated pockets of incidents here and there\" and said \"security forces acted very swiftly and decisively to address the situation\".In a statement, the UN chief Antonio Guterres said he was  \"deeply concerned\" about the situation in Tanzania, \"including reports of deaths and injuries during the demonstrations\". He urged all parties involved to \"prevent further escalation\".The UK, Canada and Norway have expressed similar concerns, citing \"credible reports of a large number of fatalities and significant injuries, as a result of the security response to protests\".There were two main opposition contenders - Tundu Lissu, who is being held on treason charges, which he denies, and Luhaga Mpina of the ACT-Wazalendo party - but he was excluded on legal technicalities.Sixteen fringe parties, none of whom have historically had significant public support, were allowed to run.Samia's ruling party Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), and its predecessor Tanu, have dominated the country's politics and have never lost an election since independence.Ahead of the election, rights groups condemned government repression, with Amnesty International citing a \"wave of terror\" involving enforced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings of opposition figures.The government rejected the claims, and officials said the election would be free and fair.Samia came into office in 2021 as Tanzania's first female president following the death of President John Magufuli.Additional reporting by Akisa Wandera in Nairobi",

    "body": "1 day agoCherylann MollanBBC News, MumbaiGetty ImagesIndia's passport ranks 85th out of 199 countries on the Henley Passport IndexEarlier this year, a video by an Indian travel influencer complaining about India's weak passport went viral on social media.He said that while neighbouring countries like Bhutan and Sri Lanka were more welcoming of Indian tourists, getting visas to travel to most Western and European countries remained a challenge.His dissatisfaction with India's poor passport strength was reflected in the latest Henley Passport Index - a ranking system of the world's passports based on visa-free travel - which placed India in the 85th spot out of 199 countries, five spots lower than last year.The Indian government has not commented on the report yet. The BBC has reached out to the ministry of external affairs.Countries like Rwanda, Ghana and Azerbaijan with much smaller economies than India - which is the fifth-largest economy globally - are ranked higher on the index at the 78th, 74th and 72nd spots, respectively.In fact, India's rank in the past decade has hovered in the 80s, even dipping to the 90th spot in 2021. These rankings are dismal compared to Asian nations like Japan, South Korea and Singapore, which have consistently held top positions.This year, like the last, Singapore topped the index with visa-free travel to 193 countries. South Korea came in second with 190 visa-free destinations and Japan ranked third with 189 countries.Meanwhile, Indian passport holders have visa-free entry to 57 countries, just like the citizens of the African country Mauritania, which shares the 85th rank with India. Getty ImagesIndian passport holders have visa-free entry to 57 countriesPassport strength reflects a nation's soft power and global influence. It also translates into better mobility for its citizens, boosting business and learning opportunities. A weak passport means more paperwork, higher visa costs, fewer travel privileges and longer waiting times for travel.But despite the decline in the rank, the number of countries offering visa-free access to Indians has actually increased in the past decade or so.For example, in 2014 - the year Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power - 52 countries offered visa-free travel to Indians and its passport ranked 76th on the index.A year later, it tumbled to the 85th position, then rose to 80th in 2023 and 2024, dropping again to the 85th position this year. Meanwhile, visa-free destinations for Indians increased from 52 in 2015 to 60 in 2023 and 62 in 2024. The number of visa-free destinations in 2025 (57) is higher than what it was in 2015 (52), yet India's rank for both these years is 85. So, why is that?Experts say that a major reason is the increasingly competitive landscape in global mobility - meaning countries are entering into more travel partnerships to benefit their citizens and their economies. According to a 2025 report by Henley & Partners, the global average number of destinations travellers are able to access visa-free has nearly doubled from 58 in 2006 to 109 in 2025.For example, China has increased the number of visa-free destinations its citizens can travel to from 50 to 82 in the past decade. Consequently, its rank on the index has improved from 94th to 60th during the same time period.Meanwhile, India - which was ranked 77th on the index in July (the Henley Passport Index is updated quarterly to reflect changes in global visa policies) as it enjoyed visa-free access to 59 countries - dropped to the 85th position in October after losing access to two countries.Getty ImagesSingapore's passport is the most powerful in the worldAchal Malhotra, former Indian ambassador to Armenia, says there are other factors that affect the strength of a country's passport, like its economic and political stability as well as its openness to welcoming citizens from other countries.For example, the US passport has dropped out of the top 10 and now occupies the 12th position - a historic low - because of its increasingly insular stance in world politics, the report says. Mr Malhotra recalls how in the 1970s, Indians enjoyed visa-free travel to many Western and European countries, but that changed after the Khalistan movement in the 1980s, which called for an independent homeland for Sikhs in India and caused internal turmoil. Subsequent political upheavals have further chipped away at India's image as a stable, democratic country.\"Many countries are also becoming increasingly wary of immigrants,\" Mr Malhotra says. \"India has a high number of people migrating to other countries or overstaying their visas and that interferes with the country's reputation.\"Factors such as how secure a country's passport is and its immigration procedures also play a role in gaining visa-free access to other countries, Mr Malhotra says.India's passport remains vulnerable to security threats. In 2024, the Delhi police arrested 203 people for alleged visa and passport fraud. India is also known for having cumbersome immigration procedures and a slow pace of visa processing.Mr Malhotra says that technological advances, like India's recently-launched electronic passport or e-passport, can improve security and ease the immigration process. The e-passport includes a small chip that stores biometric information, making it harder to forge or tamper with the document.But more diplomatic outreach and travel agreements remain key to boosting the global mobility of Indians and, by extension, India's passport ranking.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "1 day agoAndrew HardingParis correspondent, ParisThis week's trial of three undercover operatives, accused of helping the Kremlin to wage a hybrid warfare campaign to \"destabilise\" France, sounds like a surefire recipe for drama, sophistication, and intrigue.If only.Over the course of three days, in a spacious, pine-panelled courtroom on the northern edge of Paris, the case against three seemingly unremarkable Bulgarian men, seated behind glass and shadowed by three police officers who seemed absorbed with their own mobile phones, unfolded with all the panache and excitement of a half-whispered lecture in a library.\"I had absolutely no idea where we were.\"\"I did it for the money.\"\"In the future I plan to get involved in charity work.\"These few lines from the men's testimony may help convey the general tone.All three were jailed on Friday for two to four years.But to bemoan the barely audible banality of it all – the dull motives, the mumbled attempts to shift blame, the sullen complaints about prison life and unsatisfactory psychiatric evaluations - is to miss the truth.The banality is the whole point.Like the cheap drones that both Russia and Ukraine now use to patrol their front lines, the three men on trial in courtroom 2.01 at the Palais de Justice in Paris represent a low-budget evolution of modern hybrid warfare.Improvised and startlingly effective.Rising in turn inside their glass cage, Georgi Filipov, Nikolay Ivanov and Kiril Milushev admitted carrying out the acts, but denied working for a foreign power as well as antisemitism.Early one morning in May 2024, on the banks of the River Seine in the heart of Paris, the three men conspired to spray red paint - and filmed themselves doing so - on the Wall of the Righteous, a monument to those who saved French Jews from the Holocaust during World War Two. Thirty-five red handprints were left on the Shoah memorial. Five hundred more were painted elsewhere.It was the first in a series of symbolic attacks in France: pigs' heads placed outside mosques (an act blamed on a group of Serbians); coffins left ominously by the Eiffel Tower; Stars of David painted around the capital.News of each event was swiftly broadcast around the world – not just by regular media outlets, but by the automated army of Russian social media trolls which, according to the French agency monitoring such activity, routinely seeks to weaponise each sliver of news that might raise doubts about the stability of French society, and the strength of Europe's democracies, its institutions, and its values.France is seen as a particularly tempting target for the Kremlin, given its current political and social divisions, its often ambiguous attitude to Nato, its large Muslim and Jewish populations, the increasing popularity of the far right, and a history of close ties to Moscow on both extremes of the political spectrum.In another era, the Kremlin might have used its own deep undercover agents to carry out acts of sabotage or vandalism. But – to make the drone warfare comparison again – why rely solely on valuable assets like highly trained spies, giant ballistic missiles, or submarines used to cut undersea cables, when for a few thousand euros you can, through discreet and easily deniable channels, recruit your own disaffected army of petty criminals, or unemployed wannabe fascists?\"I had absolutely no idea where we were,\" said Georgi Filipov, as he tried to play down his alleged role in the \"red hands\" operation, arguing that he had travelled from Bulgaria simply to make a little money to help with child support payments for his nine-year-old son. He was allegedly paid €1,000 (£875) plus travel expenses.In the dock, Filipov, 36, cut a gaunt but muscular figure, twitching slightly like a boxer before a fight as he attempted to defuse awkward questions about his tattoos. In particular, the swastika on his chest and the social media photos showing him giving a Nazi salute and wearing a t-shirt that claimed Hitler \"was right\".\"I made bad choices in the past,\" Filipov explained, and pointed out that he had already removed several tattoos. The Paris criminal court sentenced him to two years in jail.Having been successfully extradited from Bulgaria and Croatia to face trial in France, the men all sought to place the blame on a fourth man, Mircho Angelov, who remains at large but is alleged to have links to a Russian intelligence officer. He was given a three-year term in absentia.The second defendant, Kiril Milushev, 28, said he had only come to France because he had broken up with his partner, was struggling with a bipolar disorder, and wanted to keep his friend, Mircho, company. He was given two years.Seated beside Milushev, Nikolay Ivanov creased his forehead as he denied any links with Russia. He spoke of his grandparents' role in saving Jews during World War Two and said his ambition now was to obtain a master's degree in law, and to be reunited with his girlfriend - if she'd still have him, when all this was over.Considered the mastermind behind the plot, he was given the heaviest jail term of four years.As for Russia's alleged role in the red-hands affair, even the defence lawyers openly admitted that \"we suspect\" Moscow's hand. But they insisted, as did their clients, that they were unwitting pawns, proxies – one might even say \"drones\" – in a shadow war against the West.",

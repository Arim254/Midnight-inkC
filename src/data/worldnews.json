    "body": "An Australian teenager has died after he was hit by a cricket ball during a practice session in Melbourne.Ben Austin, 17, was training - with a helmet but no neck guard - in cricket nets in Ferntree Gully on Tuesday when he was hit in the neck by a ball thrown using a handheld ball launcher. Emergency workers attended the scene around 17:00 local time (06:00 GMT) before Ben was rushed to hospital in critical condition. He was put on life support but died on Thursday.Ben's dad Jace Austin said the family was \"utterly devastated\" by the death of \"our beautiful Ben\" while Cricket Victoria said the cricketing community across the country would be mourning the teenager's death.In a statement, Jace Austin shared details of his family's loss. \"For Tracey and I, Ben was an adored son, deeply loved brother to Cooper and Zach and a shining light in the lives of our family and friends,\" he said. \"This tragedy has taken Ben from us, but we find some comfort that he was doing something he did for so many summers - going down to the nets with mates to play cricket.\"He loved cricket and it was one of the joys of his life.\"Mr Austin said the family was also supporting Ben's teammate who was bowling in the nets when the accident happened.\"This accident has impacted two young men and our thoughts are with he and his family as well,\" he said.He also thanked the local cricketing community for their support since the accident and praised the first responders and medical staff who helped his son. Cricket Victoria chief executive officer Nick Cummins said it was an \"extremely challenging time\" for all involved.\"The ball hit him in the neck in a similar accident that Phil Hughes suffered 10 years ago,\" Mr Cummins said, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).In 2014, Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes died after being struck on the neck by a ball while batting in the Sheffield Shield.His death, for which a coroner ultimately found no-one was to blame, sparked improvements to safety equipment for those playing the sport.The ball that hit Ben was apparently launched by a thrower using a handheld device, commonly used to accelerate the speed of the ball and ease the strain of bowling on the shoulders.In a statement, Cummins said: \"The entire cricketing community in Victoria - and nationally - is mourning this loss and it will be something that will stay with us for a long time.\"He described Ben as a talented player, popular teammate and captain who was well- known in under-18 circles in Melbourne's south east.\"It is heartbreaking to see a young life cut so short, while Ben was doing something that he loved so much,\" Mr Cummins said. Ben played for the Ferntree Gully Cricket Club who, in a social media post, paid tribute to the youngster as someone who brought joy to many. The club also called on friends and supporters to \"put your bats out for Benny\", mirroring a similar gesture that was made for Hughes.The Waverley Park Hawks Junior Football Club, for which Ben played more than 100 games, said he was \"kind\", \"respectful\" and a \"fantastic footballer\".\"Our club and community have lost a truly great young person who was developing into a fine young adult and his loss will be felt keenly by our club for many years to come.\"",

    "body": "K-pop group NewJeans has lost a legal battle to leave its record label Ador.A South Korean court on Tuesday ruled that the act's contract with the label, which runs until 2029, remains valid.The group's five members - Hanni, Hyein, Haerin, Danielle and Minji - announced last year that they were unilaterally leaving the agency, citing mistreatment and manipulation.The group has said it will appeal the ruling, according to local media reports.NewJeans said it is \"impossible to return to Ador\" and continue their activities as normal, the reports said.The Seoul Central Disctrict Court rejected NewJeans' argument that the dismissal of former Ador CEO Min Hee-jin, who was also the group's mentor, constituted a breach of contract. NewJeans alleged that her dismissal broke their trust with the agency.In a statement released after the ruling, Ador said it sincerely hopes that the judgment \"will serve as an opportunity for the artists to calmly reflect on this matter\". The label added that the it is ready for the members' upcoming activities, including the release of an album, and is now \"waiting\".The case stunned South Korea where record labels wield large amounts of power and tightly control their stars. It is highly unusual for artists to rebel against them. Formed in July 2022, NewJeans, whose members are aged from 17 to 21, had enjoyed rapid success before their dramatic fallout with the agency.Their first single Attention topped Korean charts right after their debut, while their hit song SuperShy made multiple \"best of the year\" lists at the end of 2023, including those compiled by Rolling Stone, NME and Billboard Magazine.Critics had called them a \"game-changer\" as their blend of 1990s R&B and sugar-coated pop melodies broke through a K-pop scene dominated by electronic beats. Tuesday's ruling follows a year-long standoff between the chart-topping group and its agency.The group's announcement to split from Ador, which was made in November last year during a press conference, came after a long and public spat between Min Hee-jin, and Ador, as well as its parent company, Hybe - South Korea's biggest music label, whose client list includes K-pop royalty such as BTS and Seventeen.Tensions between Min and Hybe started in April 2024, when Hybe launched audits into Ador, which was then managed by Min, while calling her to step down.Min rejected Hybe's allegations that she was plotting to go independent. In August, she was dismissed as the CEO of Ador.The band soon issued an ultimatum demanding that Min be reinstated. When Hybe refused, the members went public with a series of complaints against the label, including claims it had deliberately undermined their careers.One of the group's members, Hanni, also alleged that she suffered workplace harassment while working with the label.In December, Ador filed a lawsuit asking the court to confirm the validity of their contract with the group.As the disputes continued, the group's five members attemped to rebrand themselves as NJZ in February. They planned to release a new song, but the promotions were halted by a court order.The group still performed it at a show in Hong Kong, where they announced a hiatus.Back in March, after the court injunction was issued, the group described the court's decision as \"a shock\", but said the five of them would \"go through it\" together.",

    "body": "Cruise operator 'failed' woman who was left on island and died, family says10 hours agoLana LamSydneySuppliedSuzanne Rees was found dead hours after her cruise boat left Lizard IslandThe daughter of a woman who was left behind by a cruise ship on a remote island and later found dead has accused the operator of a \"failure of care and common sense\".The body of Suzanne Rees, 80, was found by rescue workers on Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef on Sunday. The day before, she had been hiking on the island with her fellow passengers but was not on the ship when it left hours later.Katherine Rees said she was \"shocked and saddened\" that the Coral Adventurer left \"without my mum\", whom she described as healthy, active, a keen gardener and bushwalker.\"From the little we have been told, it seems that there was a failure of care and common sense,\" she said on Thursday.It's understood that Suzanne Rees, from New South Wales, was on the first stop of a 60-day cruise around Australia, which had left Cairns earlier this week.Passengers, who pay tens of thousands of dollars to join the cruise, were transported to the exclusive island for a day trip with the option of hiking or snorkelling.Suzanne joined a group hike to the island's highest peak, Cook's Look, but broke away from the others as she needed to rest. \"We understand from the police that it was a very hot day, and mum fell ill on the hill climb,\" Katherine said. \"She was asked to head down, unescorted. Then the ship left, apparently without doing a passenger count.\"At some stage in that sequence, or shortly after, mum died, alone.\"Katherine said she hoped a coronial inquiry would \"find out what the company should have done that might have saved Mum's life\".The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) said it was investigating the death and would meet the ship's crew when it is due to dock in Darwin later this week.A spokesperson for Amsa said it was first alerted to the missing woman at around 21:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on Saturday by the ship's captain.A search party returned to the island a few hours later but efforts to find Suzanne were called off in the early hours of Sunday before a helicopter returned in the morning and found her body. On Wednesday, the chief executive of Coral Expeditions said the company was \"deeply sorry\" for the death and were offering their support to the Rees family. \"We are working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation. We are unable to comment further while this process is under way,\" Mark Fifield said. The Coral Adventurer caters for up to 120 guests with 46 crew, according to the company's website. It was purpose-built to access remote areas of Australia's coast and is equipped with \"tenders\" - small boats used to take passengers on day excursions.Incidents like this are rare, and cruise ships have systems to record which passengers are embarking or disembarking, Harriet Mallinson, cruise editor of travel website Sailawaze told the BBC.\"Sneaking ashore or [back] onboard just isn't an option,\" she said.Cruise lines take these procedures very seriously and have \"clever tech in place to prevent such incidents from happening. This is most likely a shocking - and tragic - one-off,\" Ms Mallinson added.",

    "description": "The French parliament has ratified an amendment to add consent to the legal definition of sexual assault and rape.Previously, rape or sexual abuse in ",
    "body": "The French parliament has ratified an amendment to add consent to the legal definition of sexual assault and rape.Previously, rape or sexual abuse in France had been defined as \"any form of sexual penetration committed with the use of violence, coercion, threat or surprise\".Now, the law will say that all sexual acts done to another without consent constitute rape.The change is the result of a cross-party, years-long debate which gained renewed urgency after last year's Pelicot rape trial, in which 50 men were found guilty of sexually assaulting or raping Gisèle Pelicot while she had been drugged unconscious by her husband Dominique.The defence of many of the accused hinged on the fact they could not be guilty of rape because they were unaware Ms Pelicot was not in a position to give her consent.Some defence lawyers in the Pelicot case had therefore argued that there could be no crime without the intention to commit it.The new bill will make this argument more tenuous, as it says that consent must be \"free and informed, specific, prior and revocable\".Consent will have to be evaluated according to the circumstances, the new law says, noting that it cannot be inferred from \"silence or lack of reaction\".\"There is no consent if the sexual act is committed through violence, coercion, threat or surprise, whatever their nature,\" it states.The two MPs who drafted the amendment - the Greens' Marie-Charlotte Garin and centrist Véronique Riotton - said a \"historic victory\" had been achieved and hailed \"a major step forward in the fight against sexual violence\".Some critics of the amendment had argued it would result in sexual relations turning into \"contracts\". Others were concerned that the changes could force victims of rape to prove they had not consented.But France's highest administrative court, the Council of State (Conseil d'État) said in March that it was backing the amendment, saying that it would \"clearly express... that sexual assaults infringe upon the fundamental principle of everyone's personal and sexual freedom\".An initial version was adopted by the National Assembly in April. Its progression was delayed by France's current political turmoil, but on Wednesday the Senate definitively adopted the bill, with 327 votes in favour and 15 abstentions. It then went back to parliament, which gave it final approval.Last year Greens senator Mélanie Vogel argued that while society had \"already accepted the fact that the difference between sex and rape is consent\" but that criminal law had not kept up.\"This is a historic step forward, following in the footsteps of several other European countries,\" Lola Schulmann, advocacy officer at Amnesty International France, told AFP on Wednesday.Sweden, Germany and Spain are among the European countries that already have consent-based rape laws.",

    "body": "1 hour agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor and Anna Holligan,Hague correspondent in LeidenReutersInitial exit polls had put D66 Leader Rob Jetten (left) in the lead, while Geert Wilders' Freedom Party has lost groundRob Jetten's centrist-liberal party D66 are in a neck-and-neck race with anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders in the Dutch election, according to latest vote projections.With about 98% of votes counted, both D66 and Wilders' Freedom Party were  heading for 26 seats in the 150-member parliament, a projection from Dutch news agency ANP said on Thursday.Initial exit polls had put Jetten in the lead. \"Millions of Dutch people have turned a page; they've said goodbye to a politics of negativity,\" he told supporters.A downbeat Wilders had earlier conceded the result was not what he wanted, having lost 11 seats, but said he had still achieved his second best result ever.As the final few results trickled in on Thursday, Wilders took a narrow lead in the race, but it was so close that by the afternoon there were fewer than 2,000 votes between the two frontrunners. Both parties won less than 17% of the national vote.Three other parties were not far behind, including the conservative liberals on 22 seats, followed by the left-wing GreenLeft-Labour party and the Christian Democrats.Wilders led the polls throughout the election campaign, but after he pulled the plug on his own coalition in June in a row over asylum and migration, all the mainstream leaders made clear they did not wish to work with him again.He admits he has little hope of forming a government himself, but said on X on Thursday that if his party did top the vote he should have the first try. Even without a clear-cut victory, Jetten - who staged a remarkable campaign - would stand a stronger chance of leading the next administration.Only a few weeks ago, the polls put D66 on just 12 seats, but the photogenic, 38-year-old liberal leader capitalised on polished performances in a succession of TV debates and interviews. The fact that he also competed in a TV quiz show called The Smartest Person in the weeks leading to the vote only added to his public profile.EPARob Jetten, 38, led a highly polished campaign and outperformed his rivals in TV debatesJetten was careful not to claim victory on Wednesday night, despite the party mood among his supporters.The conservative liberal VVD of Dilan Yesilgöz was also heading for a successful night in third place and her party would be a good fit for any potential Jetten-led coalition.Going into Wednesday's election, voters knew the result would be on a knife-edge, as five parties were in the running to win. Wilders' PVV Freedom Party won 37 seats in November 2023, but many of those voters will have been put off by the realisation he would struggle to find parties to work with him again.It took seven months for Wilders to reach a deal with coalition partners in 2024, only to bring down the government 11 months later. Rob Jetten made clear he was looking for a broad-based coalition that was both \"stable and ambitious\", and he pointed out it was unprecedented for the winning party to score fewer than 30 seats in parliament.He named the Labour(PvdA)-GreenLeft of former European Commissioner Frans Timmermans as one potential coalition partner, along with Yesilgöz's conservative liberals and a revitalised Christian Democrat CDA.He is also likely to consider JA21, a populist right-wing party with 9 MPs, but his options are limited as he has to assemble a majority of at least 76 seats.SEM VAN DER WAL/ANP/AFPDilan Yesilgöz (R) also had a good election after good performances in TV debatesThe exit poll spelt bad news for Frans Timmermans, whose left-wing party had long been second in the polls and is now set to come fourth. \"Better times lie ahead,\" he promised his supporters late on Wednesday. \"Of course I'm hugely disappointed,\" he added, and announced he was stepping down and taking responsibility for the result.Timmermans and Wilders are both in their early 60s and entered politics at the same time, and there is now a sense that Dutch voters are prepared to try something new.Wilders, however, said he was going nowhere: \"You won't be rid of me until I'm 80.\" He remained bullish about his Freedom Party's performance: \"I would naturally rather have seen more seats... but we have still had our second best result.\"Matthijs Rooduijn of the University of Amsterdam said Wilders' party had lost the support of many of its moderate voters to other parties as well as many on the more radical side.But, he said, \"the losses could have been worse\", given that Wilders had himself broken up the last coalition and had campaigned less actively than his rivals.Anna Holligan/BBCSupporters of Jetten's centrist liberals were overjoyed with the surprise resultThere was palpable excitement as D66 supporters gathered for the results at a music venue in Leiden, a university city between Amsterdam and The Hague. As the exit polls became clear, the words \"yes, we can\" were voiced repeatedly as a kind of party mantra in the hall.Taking to the stage, the man now tipped to be the youngest prime minister in modern Dutch history told supporters \"we did it - the best result D66 has ever achieved\".\"We also know that millions of Dutch people voted for other parties, and I also feel a very heavy responsibility for [all of them],\" said Rob Jetten. \"We will do all we can in the coming years to show all the Dutch people that politics and government can be there for them again so they can think big again and act big again so the Netherlands can move forward.\"This election was partly fought on migration and overcrowded asylum centres, but the biggest issue for voters was the chronic housing shortage of almost 400,000 homes, in a population of 18 million.Jetten's party has said it will build 10 cities as part of its plan to tackle the crisis.\"It was a campaign of optimism, it shows the Dutch are tired of two years of standstill, we recognise big challenges and we want progress on those,\" said D66 supporter Eline. \"It shows the Dutch are craving a prime minister who is able to unite the country and tackle the major challenges our country and the world are facing.\"Another potential coalition partner for the liberals is the Christian Democrats, who only two years ago looked down and out with just a handful of seats. Now they are projected to win 18. \"What a fantastic result - two years ago we could not have dared to dream of this,\" CDA leader Henri Bontenbal told supporters as they chanted his name.",

    "body": "Romania's defence ministry has said the US intends to reduce some of its troops stationed on Nato's eastern flank.Between 900 and 1,000 American troops will remain in Romania, Bucharest said - down from 1,700. The ministry said the decision was expected and that the \"resizing\" of US forces was a result of the new priorities of the Trump presidential administration.The Pentagon said the decision did not constitute a \"withdrawal from Europe or a signal of lessened commitment to Nato and Article 5\". Article 5 holds that Nato members will come to the defence of an ally which comes under attack, and has long been seen as the main deterrent against potential Russian aggression.Defence Minister Ionut Mosteanu stated that his US counterpart Pete Hegseth had recently conveyed to the Europeans that they needed to pay more attention to their own defence and that the US was shifting its attention towards the Indo-Pacific region.One US brigade at the Mihai Kogalniceanu airbase - set to be Nato's largest in Europe - would be rotated out and not replaced, Mosteanu said.The brigade has \"elements\" in Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary, Mosteanu said, although it was unclear whether US troops were going to be pulled out of these countries too.Polish Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said on Wednesday that Warsaw had \"no information\" about a possible reduction of US troops on its territory. The presence of US troops at Romania's Deveselu and Campia Turzii bases would remain unchanged, Ionut Mosteanu added.Since taking office in January US President Donald Trump has made no secret of his wish to shift the focus of US military commitment from Europe to the Indo-Pacific region, and has repeatedly urged European Nato members to take more responsibility for the continent's defence.But the announcement of the US troop withdrawal from Romania will be concerning for Eastern European countries, many of which feel they have reason to fear a Russian attack in the future.Shortly after the announcement from Bucharest, a Nato official stressed that Washington's commitment to the Nato alliance remained \"clear\" and adjustments were \"not unusual\".\"Even with this adjustment, the US force posture in Europe remains larger than it has been for many years, with many more US forces on the continent than before 2022,\" the official said in a statement.The Pentagon also stressed that the US maintained a \"robust presence\" throughout Europe as well as \"the ability to array forces and capabilities to meet objectives... including President Trump's commitment to defend Nato allies\".The US has more than 100,000 military personnel deployed in Europe, according to figures from late last year.Last month Nato announced the creation of a mission dubbed Eastern Sentry, which it said would enhance the alliance's vigilance along the entire eastern flank. The decision came after a dozen Russian drones entered Polish airspace, in the most serious incident of its kind since the war began in February 2022. Days later,  Romania reported that a Russian drone had breached its airspace, and Estonia said Russian warplanes had violated its airspace too.",

    "body": "9 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorReutersRob Jetten became one of the youngest ministers in Dutch history under former PM Mark RutteRob Jetten's achievement in dragging his socially liberal D66 party from fifth place to the top of Dutch politics in less than two years has been extraordinary. But politically, all the stars were perfectly aligned for the 38-year-old to do so.The result of Wednesday's election is too close to call, with Jetten vying with anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders for the most seats in parliament.No other political leader commanded as much screen time during the campaign as Jetten and his smile and cheerful message resonated with voters, while his rivals sometimes struggled.Hardly a night went by without him on TV. When Wilders cancelled an appearance because of security fears, Rob Jetten seized the moment and took his place. He even featured in a TV quiz show recorded months ago called The Smartest Person.And his D66 party was untarnished by involvement in Wilders' ill-fated 11-month coalition, largely because Jetten had fared so poorly in the last election in 2023. The government collapsed last June when Wilders' party quit following a row over migration.But perhaps more than anything else, he was able to convey a positive message summed up by the slogan Het kan wel - an optimistic phrase that borrows from Barack Obama's \"Yes, we can\".It contrasted strongly with Wilders, who he accused of \"sowing division\".If his party does come top, Rob Jetten could become the Netherlands' first openly gay prime minister.A self-confessed politics nerd as a child, the young Jetten grew up in a small town in the southern province of Brabant and came out when he was young.Jetten has not made his private life part of his political identity, but five years ago he posted a video in which he read out a long list of homophobic messages from his phone, to prove why an international day against homophobia was important.Jetten is now engaged to Argentine hockey player, Nicolás Keenan, and they are due to marry next year.EPAJetten led a highly polished campaign and outperformed rivals in TV debatesHe was an early supporter of the centrist D66, which describes itself as progressive and socially liberal party, and officials soon spotted his potential.After a few years working for Dutch rail network ProRail, Jetten was elected as an MP in 2017 and had a couple of early experiences as leader before he served under long-serving prime minister Mark Rutte as climate minister.But not everything has worked out smoothly in Jetten's career. A parliamentary colleague complained he was \"pushy\" on the climate, and his big ambitions as minister were cut short when Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices soaring.He led D66's disastrous campaign in 2023 when the party came away with only nine seats, two years after his predecessor Sigrid Kaag managed second place after Rutte.Jetten was not yet as fluent in front of the cameras. Some media appearances he gave were criticised as dull, and one critic labelled him \"Robot Jetten\".\"Robot Jetten is going to be prime minister!\" one reporter said to him incredulously as his success became clear on Wednesday night.\"Sometimes it can work out really crazy in politics,\" Jetten replied with a broad grin.EPAJetten fought a close race against anti-Islam populist Geert WildersSupporters see him as a kind of mini-Mark Rutte, who is now head of Nato. And that comparison will suit Jetten fine, as many Dutch now look back warmly on the stability of the Rutte years, after two years of relative turmoil.Both men always appear cheerful and pragmatic, and both are notorious for getting by on precious little sleep. However, party colleague Roy Kramer noticed a difference: \"Rutte is a chatterbox, Jetten is a bit quieter,\" he told Dutch newspaper Het Parool.The liberal leader has big ambitions, and few challenges are more pressing than tackling the Netherlands' housing crisis, with a shortage of some 400,000 homes.Jetten wants to build 10 cities and complains Dutch governments have not really achieved anything impressive for the past 10 to 15 years. He is making big promises and will come under pressure to deliver.For Jetten to succeed he will need some of Rutte's teflon political coating that saw him through four governments.He has already survived one awkward moment in the campaign, when a joke about Crown Princess Amalia fell flat in front of 2,000 students in Rotterdam.\"I think the best way of promoting work in the military is being able to end up training with the Crown Princess. I bet a few guys in this audience would be interested in that,\" he said.The debate moderator hit back saying: \"what kind of sexist remark is that?\"Jetten later admitted it was inappropriate, but it appears to have done him no harm.

    "body": "Trump hails 'amazing' meeting with China's Xi but no formal trade deal agreed 2 hours agoLaura Bicker,China correspondent , Anthony Zurcher,North America correspondent and Flora DruryUS President Donald Trump has hailed an \"amazing\" meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, amid rising hopes for a de-escalation of tensions between the world's two biggest economies.Beijing was less effusive, saying the two side had reached a consensus to resolve \"major trade issues\" during the leaders' first face-to-face meeting in six years.Trump's trade war had set off tit-for-tat tariffs that shot past 100% on both sides, but they agreed to a truce in May - although tensions remained high.Thursday's talks did not lead to a formal agreement but the announcements suggest they are closer to a deal - the details of which have long been subject to behind-the-scenes negotiations.Trade deals normally take years to negotiate, and countries around the world have been thrown into resolving differences with the current Trump administration within a matter of months.One key win for Trump is that China has agreed to suspend export control measures it had placed on rare earths, crucial for the production of everything from smartphones to fighter jets.A jubilant president told reporters on Air Force One that he had also got China to start immediately buying a \"tremendous amounts of soybeans and other farm products\". Retaliatory tariffs on American soybeans by Beijing had effectively halted imports from the US, harming US farmers - a key voting block for Trump.There was, however, no mention of a breakthrough on TikTok. The US has sought to take the video-sharing app's US operations away from Chinese parent company ByteDance for national security reasons. Beijing said afterwards it would continue to work to resolve the issues.Meanwhile, the US has said it will drop part of the tariffs it has levied on Beijing over the flow of ingredients used in making fentanyl to the US. Trump has imposed severe tariffs on the US's top trade partners for their perceived failure to clamp down on the drug.However, it seems other tariffs, or taxes on imported goods, will remain in place, meaning that goods arriving in the US from China are still being taxed at a rate of over 40% for US importers.Beijing will also be able to speak to Jensen Huang, the head of US tech firm Nvidia - according to Trump. Nvidia is at the heart of the two countries' fight over AI chips: China wants high-end chips but the US wants to limit China's access, citing national security.Beijing has also extended an invitation to Trump to visit China in April - yet another sign of thawing relations.'A good start'But the meeting also showed the gulf between the two leaders' approaches.Xi was self-contained, and said only what he had prepared. He entered the meeting knowing he had a strong hand. China had learned from Trump's first term, leveraging its chokehold on rare earths, and diversifying its trade partners so it is less reliant on the US.Afterwards, he was far more measured in his language than Trump. The two sides would be working on delivering outcomes that will serve as a \"reassuring pill\" for both countries' economies, he said.Trump was - as always - more ad-lib. But the US president was also noticeably more tense than he had been for the rest of his whirlwind trip to South East Asia - a reflection of the high stakes in Thursday's meeting.The glamour and pageantry on show since he arrived at his first stop in Malaysia just five days ago was also absent.Gone were the gold-laden palaces of the sort he was welcomed to in Japan on Tuesday. Instead, a building at an airport, lying behind barbed wire and security checkpoints.The military bands which welcomed Trump to South Korea on Wednesday were nowhere to be seen.Instead, the only sign something important was going on inside was the heavy police and media presence.But despite the quieter public face, what was happening inside was arguably the most significant hour and 20 minutes of the trip.Henry Wang, a former adviser to China's State Council, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Trump and Xi's talks \"went very well\".It may not have been a trade deal, but a \"framework and structure has been laid\", he added - calling it \"a good start\".",

    "body": "1 day agoIan Aikman and Elettra NeysmithMessages in a bottle written by two Australian soldiers in 1916 have been found more than a century later on the country's south-western coast.The cheerful notes were penned just a few days into their voyage to join the battlefields of France during World War One. One of the soldiers, Pte Malcolm Neville, told his mother that the food on board was \"real good\" and that they were \"as happy as Larry\". Months later, he was killed in action at the age of 28. The other soldier, 37-year-old Pte William Harley, survived the war and returned home.The letters have been passed on to their descendants, who have been stunned by the discovery.The bottle was found earlier this month on the remote Wharton Beach, near Esperance in Western Australia, by local resident Deb Brown and her family.She was visiting the beach with her husband and daughter on one of their regular quad bike trips to clear up litter, when they spotted a thick glass bottle in the sand, she said on Tuesday.\"We do a lot of cleaning up on our beaches and so would never go past a piece of rubbish. So this little bottle was lying there waiting to be picked up,\" Ms Brown told the Associated Press news agency.Though the paper was wet, both letters were still legible, so Ms Brown began tracking down the soldiers' families in order to pass them on.Ms Brown located Pte Neville's great-nephew, Herbie Neville, by searching for the soldier's name and the town he was from online, as his mother's address was included in the note.Mr Neville told ABC News the experience had been \"unbelievable\" for his family.The second letter, written by Pte William Harley, was addressed simply to whoever found the bottle. His mother had died years earlier.Pte Harley's granddaughter, Ann Turner, told ABC she and the soldier's four other surviving grandchildren were \"absolutely stunned\" by the message.\"It really does feel like a miracle and we do very much feel like our grandfather has reached out for us from the grave,\" she said.\"I feel very emotional when I see that the other young man had a mother to write to, and that message in the bottle was to his mother, whereas our grandfather long ago had lost his mother so he just writes it to the finder of the bottle.\"The bottle was thrown overboard \"somewhere in the Bight\", Pte Harley's letter said, referring to the Great Australian Bight off the country's southern coast.An oceanography professor told ABC it may only have been in the water for a few weeks before it landed at Wharton Beach, where it may have remained buried for 100 years.",

    "body": "41 minutes agoKathryn ArmstrongReutersPrecious crown jewels were taken during the theft earlier this monthFive more suspects have been arrested over their involvement in the Louvre heist, Paris' public prosecutor has said.They were detained on Wednesday night in the Paris region during coordinated raids, according to Laure Beccuau. One of the suspects is thought to be part of the four-man team that carried out the heist, who were seen on CCTV. Two of the other alleged thieves have already been arrested and have \"partially recognised\" their involvement in the brazen theft, while the fourth person has not yet been caught. It is not clear what role the other newly arrested people allegedly played in the theft, but Beccuau told French radio station RTL on Thursday that they \"may eventually inform us about how the incident took place\".Beccuau said the arrests had been made in areas in and around Paris, including the  suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis.Phones and other objects found on the suspects during the raid were allowing investigators to study encrypted messages, she added.Those arrested can be detained for up to four days before being charged or released.How Louvre gang carried out France's most shocking theftFrench investigators are not giving many more details away at this stage but Beccuau said that DNA from one of those arrested on Wednesday night could be linked to the crime scene. \"We had him in our sights,\" she said of the main suspect. She specified that the latest arrests were not related to statements made by the previously detained suspects but to \"other elements of the case\".The authorities have previously said that the gang involved in the heist could be bigger than those who physically stole the jewels.Items worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the Louvre - the world's most-visited museum - on 19 October, when four thieves broke into the building in broad daylight. The precious jewels have not been recovered yet.Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen A tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenThe first two people who were arrested over the heist - both men in their thirties with criminal records - are thought to be the pair who used power tools to enter the museum's  Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) and steal some of the French crown jewels.They were taken into custody late last week. Beccuau told a press conference on Wednesday that one of the men was arrested as he tried to board a one-way flight to Algeria, but that the other man had not been planning to leave France, contrary to earlier media reports.There was no evidence at this stage to suggest the theft was an inside job, she added, confirming no accomplices worked at the museum. On the day of the heist, the robbers arrived at 09:30, just after the museum opened to visitors, Beccuau said at a press conference on Wednesday.The suspects arrived with a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Gallery of Apollo via a balcony close to the River Seine. The men used a disc cutter to crack open display cases housing the jewellery.Beccuau said the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38, before switching to cars and heading east. Nobody had been threatened during the raid. France's justice minister said security protocols in the Louvre - one of the world's most famous museums - \"failed\" in preventing the theft. It was later revealed by the Louvre's director that the only camera monitoring the Gallery of Apollo was pointing away from a balcony the thieves climbed over to break in. Since the incident, security measures have been tightened around France's cultural institutions.The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following the heist. They will now be stored in the Bank's most secure vault, 26m (85ft) below the ground floor of its elegant headquarters in central Paris.Watch: Two people leave Louvre in lift mounted to vehicle",

    "body": "Just nowBarbara Plett Usher,Africa correspondent and Lucy FlemingThe leader of Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has declared an investigation into what he called violations committed by his soldiers during the capture of el-Fasher. The announcement by Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, came after escalating reports of mass civilian killings following the RSF takeover of the city in the Darfur region on Sunday. The UN Security Council is expected to hold a meeting on Sudan, which is in its third year of civil war between the army and the paramilitary fighters. The RSF leader spoke after international outrage about reports of mass killings in el-Fasher, apparently documented by his paramilitary fighters in social media videos.BBC Verify has analysed the footage confirming that they show the RSF soldiers executing a number of unarmed people in the city.The RSF denies widespread allegations that the killings in el-Fasher are ethnically motivated and follow a pattern of the Arab paramilitaries targeting non-Arab populations.Reports of mass killings in Sudan have echoes of its dark pastNew videos show executions after RSF militia takes key Sudan cityA simple guide to what is happening in SudanHemedti said he was sorry for the disaster that had befallen the people of el-Fasher and admitted there had been violations by his forces, which would be investigated by a committee that has now arrived in the city.However, observers have noted that similar promises made in the past - in response to accusations of a massacre in the Darfuri city of el-Geneina in 2023, and alleged atrocities during the group's control of the central state of Gezira - were never fulfilled.The UN World Health Organization (WHO) has said it is appalled and deeply shocked by reports that more than 460 civilians, including patients and their companions, were shot dead, at the last partially functioning hospital in el-Fasher.Mohamad Faisal, a spokesperson for the Sudan Doctors Network based in the UK, says their teams on the ground had confirmed Tuesday's attack on el-Fasher's Saudi Hospital as seen in social media footage.\"What we have seen is actually absolutely horrific,\" he told the BBC's Newsday programme.\"The RSF soldiers went into the wards killing inpatients as well as going to the outpatient areas and killing the people who are waiting to be seen in the clinics - so many people.\"Dr Faisal said it had been a terrible three days for his colleagues, some of whom had managed to escape, making the dangerous journey to the town of Tawila, about 60km (37 miles) west of el-Fasher.Others were still in el-Fasher, where an estimated 250,000 people, many from non-Arab communities, have been trapped during the RSF's 18-month siege of the city.From statistics the Sudan Doctors Network had pulled together, he put the figure of those killed at the hospital at 450.\"There were 200 inpatients were killed and then they were 250 between the outpatients and people visiting the hospital,\" Dr Faisal said.Throughout the 550 days of the siege the RSF had often targeted the hospital, which has mainly been dealing with cases of severe malnutrition, he said.\"Air drone strikes and artillery shelling\" on the facility had increased in the last couple of months, he added.About 5,000 people had arrived in Tawila from el-Fasher in recent days, most traumatised and a very weak condition, often suffering abuse, violence and racketeering en route, according to Caroline Bouvard from the aid group Solidarités International.\"We've had many confirmations of rapes and gender-based violence,\" she told BBC Newsday, adding that they also confirmed the recent accounts of summary executions.Activists have also stepped-up demands for international pressure on the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which is widely accused of providing military support to the RSF. The UAE denies this despite evidence presented in UN reports.El-Fasher had been the army's last stronghold in the western region of Darfur, and was captured by the RSF after the long siege marked by starvation and heavy bombardment.The takeover of el-Fasher reinforces the geographic split in the country, with the RSF now in control of western Sudan and much of neighbouring Kordofan to the south, and the army holding the capital, Khartoum, central and eastern regions along the Red Sea.The two warring rivals had been allies - coming to power together in a coup in 2021 - but fell out over an internationally backed plan to move towards civilian rule.The African Union's Peace and Security Council has called for humanitarian corridors to be opened to allow life-saving aid for those in el-Fasher and an immediate investigation to bring to account those responsible for the atrocities.\"The investigations by themselves right now will not bring succour to those living in terrible conditions in Sudan, which incidentally is the world's worst humanitarian situation,\" Dr Mohamed Ibn Chambas, chair of an AU panel on Sudan, told the BBC.For more than 500 days the people of el-Fasher and its surrounds had \"experienced hell on Earth\", he said.\"We have said time and again that there can be no military solution to the Sudanese crisis, and this is why we have been engaged in working with civilian and political groups to convene an all-Sudanese inclusive dialogue.\"We need now to work with the Sudanese to tackle the root causes of their problem, which they themselves admit has to do with exclusion. Failure to manage diversity in Sudan has been at the heart of the recurrent crisis the country has experienced since its independence in 1956,\" Chambas said.",

    "body": "Trump directs nuclear weapons testing to resume for first time in over 30 years33 minutes agoMax MatzaGetty ImagesPresident Donald Trump has called on US military leaders to resume testing nuclear weapons in order to keep pace with other countries such as Russia and China.\"Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,\" he wrote on social media just before meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea.The US has more nuclear weapons than any other country, Trump said, with Russia second and China a \"distant third\". It has not conducted nuclear testing since 1992.It comes just days after Trump denounced Russia for testing a nuclear-powered missile. The Kremlin says its tests were \"not nuclear\".Later, on Air Force One after the two leaders' meeting, Trump said the nuclear test sites would be determined later.\"With others doing testing, I think it's appropriate that we do also,\" Trump said on his way back to Washington.No country except North Korea has conducted a nuclear test explosion in this century, according to the Arms Control Association (ACA) - and even Pyongyang announced a moratorium in 2018. Trump's announcement did not make it clear whether he was referring to testing a nuclear explosion, or simply a weapon system that would be capable of delivering a nuclear weapon.His post on Wednesday night acknowledged the \"tremendous destructive power\" of nuclear weapons, but said he had \"no choice\" but to update and renovate the US arsenal during his first term in office.He also said that China's nuclear programme \"will be even within 5 years\".The announcement marks an apparent reversal of a long-standing US policy. The last US nuclear weapons test was in 1992, before former Republican President George HW Bush issued a moratorium as the Cold War ended.Russia announced over the weekend that it had successfully tested two new weapons capable of carrying nuclear warheads.These included a missile which the Kremlin said could penetrate US defence systems, and an underwater drone called Poseidon, capable of hitting the American west coast and triggering radioactive ocean swells. But those tests did not involve the detonation of nuclear weapons.On Thursday, Russia denied it had carried out nuclear tests.\"Regarding the tests of Poseidon and Burevestnik, we hope that the information was conveyed correctly to President Trump,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. \"This cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test.\" The Kremlin said the United States had not notified Russia of its intention to conduct nuclear weapons testing.\"The US is a sovereign country which has a right to make its sovereign decisions. But I want to recall President Putin's statement, which has been repeated many times: if someone departs from the moratorium, Russia will act accordingly,\" the spokesman said.China has also responded to Trump's announcement, saying it hoped the US would earnestly fulfil its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and honour its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.Who has the most nuclear weapons?Trump has said the US has more nuclear weapons than any other country.The exact number of warheads held by each country is kept secret in each case - but Russia is thought to have a total of about 5,459 warheads while the US has about 5,177, according to the Federation of American Scientists (FAS).The US-based ACA gives slightly higher estimates, saying America's nuclear stockpile sits at about 5,225 warheads, while Russia has approximately 5,580.China is the third largest nuclear power with about 600 warheads, France has 290, the United Kingdom 225, India 180, Pakistan 170, Israel 90 and North Korea 50, FAS reports.According to US think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), China has roughly doubled its nuclear arsenal in the past five years and is expected to exceed 1,000 weapons by 2030.Trump's statement about nuclear testing came about 100 days before the expiration of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New Start) in February 2026 - the last remaining nuclear arms treaty between the US and Russia.The agreement limits each country to 1,550 warheads on deployed missiles capable of crossing continents.When and where was the last US test?The last time the US tested a nuclear bomb was 23 September 1992. The test took place at an underground facility in the western state of Nevada.The project, code named Divider,  was the 1,054th nuclear weapons test conducted by the US, according to the Los Alamos National Laboratory, which played a central role in helping develop the world's first atomic bomb.The Nevada Test Site, 65 miles (105km) north of Las Vegas, is still operated by the US government.\"If deemed necessary, the site could be authorised again for nuclear weapons testing,\" according to the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History, which is an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution.But some experts note that it would take the US at least 36 months to restart underground nuclear tests at the former Nevada test site.\"Trump is misinformed and out of touch,\" Daryl G Kimball, executive director of the ACA, wrote on X. \"The US has no technical, military, or political justification for resuming nuclear explosive testing for the first time since 1992.\"\"Trump will trigger strong public opposition in Nevada, from all US allies, and it could trigger a chain reaction of nuclear testing by US adversaries, and blow apart the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, \" Mr Kimball added.Trump's announcement also drew negative reactions from a few opposition Democrats. Representative Dina Titus, from Nevada, wrote on X: \"I'll be introducing legislation to put a stop to this.\"The US first marched into the nuclear era with the Trinity test of the first atomic bomb in July 1945 in the desert at Alamogordo, New Mexico.It later became the only country in the world to use nuclear weapons in warfare after dropping two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August of the same year during World War Two.Approximately 140,000 people were killed in Hiroshima and 74,000 in Nagasaki, with many deaths occurring from immediate blast effects, burns, and later from radiation sickness.",

    "body": "20 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterFootage shows gunfire and drones in Rio raidsThe number of people known to have been killed in a deadly police raid in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro on Tuesday has risen to 132, officials say.This is more than double the figure cited after the police operation in the favelas (poor neighbourhoods) of Alemão and Penha, in the north of Rio de Janeiro, on Tuesday.The public defender's office, which provides legal assistance to the poor, made the new death toll public after grieving residents lay dozens of bodies in a square  early on Wednesday.The police raid was the deadliest in the city, where authorities have for decades tried to contain the gangs which control many of its poorer neighbourhoods.ANTONIO LACERDA/EPA/ShutterstockPolice said that among those detained were key members of the Red Command gangAsked about the figure given by the public defender's office, Rio state Governor Cláudio Castro said that forensic work was still under way and that until it had concluded, the official figure which he had been given was of 58 dead, although it was \"certain to change\".Among those expressing shock about the death toll was Brazil's President, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. According to Brazil's justice minister, Lula was \"astonished\" and also expressed his surprise that the federal government had not been informed beforehand. Even before the number of dead had more than doubled, the United Nations Human Rights office had said it was \"horrified\" by the police operation.Early on Wednesday, residents took the bodies of those killed into a square in Penha, where they placed them next to each other in a long line to show the deadly nature of the raid.According to Brazilian media, estimates varied between at least 50 and more than 70 bodies. Many of the bodies had reportedly been retrieved from a nearby hillside, where police said most of the deadly clashes had unfolded. Challenged by journalists about earlier remarks he had made describing those killed as \"criminals\", Governor Castro replied: \"To be quite honest with you, the conflict wasn't in a built-up area, it was all in the woods. So I don't believe anyone was just strolling in the woods on a day of conflict. And that's why we can easily classify them.\"REUTERS/Aline MassucaResidents were distraught after the raid, in which at least 64 people were killedResidents described the scenes unfolding on Tuesday as \"war-like\", with shoot-outs between officers and armed men - with buses set on fire to create barricades.According to the police, gang members also used drones to drop explosives on the officers as they fanned out through the neighbourhoods, which are strongholds of the Red Command.\"This is how the Rio police are treated by criminals: with bombs dropped by drones. This is the scale of the challenge we face. This is not ordinary crime, but narco-terrorism,\" Governor Castro, said. Governor Castro said that the raid had been two months in the planning and was based on a thorough investigation. Among those arrested is a man accused of being a leading drug dealer for the Red Command. The governor also posted photos on social media of the four police officers who were killed in the operation.He praised the officers killed on what he called \"a historic day\" in which he said they \"confronted organised crime\".Rafael Soares, a Brazilian journalist covering crime in Rio, told BBC News Brasil that the Red Command had been on the offensive in Rio in recent years, reclaiming territory it had lost to its rivals, First Capital Command (PCC).Soares added that the police operation was part of Governor Castro's efforts to leave his mark and deal a decisive blow to crime in the city ahead of elections next year. The police raid also comes just days before the city is due to host the C40 World Mayors Summit - a meeting of nearly 100 mayors from the world's leading cities - and the Earthshot Prize - the environmental award which will be handed out by Prince William on 5 November.  Huge police raids are not unusual in Rio, but the number of fatalities in Tuesday's operation is.According to  Soares, police operations in which more than 20 people are killed are \"very rare\" across Brazil and those that do occur, have mainly happened in Rio. Rio de Janeiro's Minister for Public Security, Victor Santos, said that 280,000 people lived in the areas where the raids took place. Police footage showed heavily-armed officers patrolling the narrow, steep lanes of the densely populated hillside favelas.\"This is a war we are seeing in Rio de Janeiro. Decades of inaction by all the institutions - municipal, state and federal - have allowed crime to expand in our territory,\" Santos said.With additional reporting by BBC News Brazil's Marina Rossi and Mariana Alvim in São Paulo.",

It was not clear whether Salameh had been the target of the operation.Israel has stepped up its attacks on people and targets it says are linked to Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim group backed by Iran.The Lebanese President, Joseph Aoun, instructed the commander of the Lebanese army to confront any Israeli incursion into southern Lebanon.Prime Minister Nawaf Salam denounced the killing of Salameh and the incursion as a \"flagrant violation of Lebanese institutions and sovereignty\".He said Lebanon would continue pressing the United Nations and ceasefire guarantors \"to ensure a halt to the repeated violations and the implementation of a complete Israeli withdrawal from our lands\".Protests were held on Thursday morning in Blida and nearby towns, where residents blocked roads with burning tyres to denounce what they called a \"blatant aggression\" and the state's failure to protect civilians.AFPIsraeli aircraft carried out a strike on the outskirts of the southern Lebanese village of Jarmaq on ThursdayOver recent days, Israel intensified its strikes across Lebanon, saying it was targeting Hezbollah positions.A second Israeli operation was reported overnight in the nearby village of Adaisseh, where residents say troops blew up a religious ceremonial hall.Israeli warplanes also flew over parts of southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley on Thursday, while drones were again seen circling low above Beirut's southern suburbs.During a meeting of ceasefire monitors on Wednesday, US envoy Morgan Ortagus said Washington welcomed Lebanon's \"decision to bring all weapons under state control by the end of the year\", adding that the Lebanese army \"must now fully implement its plan\".Under the ceasefire agreement, Israeli troops were to withdraw from southern Lebanon, while Hezbollah was to move its fighters north of the Litani river and dismantle its military infrastructure there - a plan the group and its allies strongly oppose.Only the Lebanese army and the UN peacekeeping force, Unifil, are authorised to deploy armed personnel in the area south of the Litani, but Israel has maintained positions at several strategic border sites.",

    "body": "1 day agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterThe co-founder of ice cream maker Ben & Jerry's says that its parent company Unilever blocked it from launching an ice cream flavour that expressed \"solidarity with Palestine\".Ben Cohen announced that he will independently create the new flavour as part of a personal series highlighting causes the company has been barred from addressing publicly.Ben & Jerry's is known for its activism on social issues and has consistently spoken out on political, environmental and humanitarian matters - including the Israel-Gaza conflict.A spokesperson for the Magnum Ice Cream Company, Unilever's ice cream arm, said it had determined that \"now is not the right time to invest in developing this product\". Mr Cohen's statement deepens the long-drawn dispute between the world-famous ice cream maker and Unilever, the British packaged goods giant which has owned Ben & Jerry's since 2000.The co-founders said Unilever and Magnum, which is in the process of being spun off from its parent company, had unlawfully blocked their company from \"honouring its social mission\".But Magnum said: \"The independent members of Ben & Jerry's Board are not, and have never been, responsible for the Ben & Jerry's commercial strategy and execution.\"It said the company would continue to focus on \"ongoing, impactful campaigns close to its communities\", including campaigning for improved conditions in refugee accommodation in the UK, and freedom of speech rights in the United States.  Mr Cohen said in an Instagram video on Tuesday that he is creating a new watermelon-flavoured sorbet, calling for ideas for the product's name and what ingredients should be added.The watermelon has become a symbol for solidarity with Palestinians due to its colours, which are similar to those of the Palestinian flag – red, green, black and white. The American entrepreneur said Ben & Jerry's were prevented by Unilever from creating the dessert.\"I'm doing what they couldn't,\" Mr Cohen says from his set in a kitchen. \"I'm making a watermelon-flavoured ice cream that calls for permanent peace in Palestine and calls for repairing the damage that was done there.\"In 2021, Ben & Jerry's refused to sell its products in areas occupied by Israel. Its Israeli operation was sold by Unilever to a local licensee, allowing its ice cream to continue being sold in the occupied West Bank.The dessert series will be developed under Ben's Best, Mr Cohen's activist ice cream brand, he said in a statement to the press. The flavour is being produced independently of Ben & Jerry's, the statement said.Ben's Best was first setup in 2016 to support former US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, with the flavour \"Bernie's Back\". Mr Cohen said he will develop other ice cream flavours that speak to the issues Ben & Jerry's was silenced from addressing publicly by Unilever.In September, co-founder Jerry Greenfield stepped down from Ben & Jerry's after decades at the company, citing concerns that its independence had been compromised following Unilever's decision to curb its social activism.At the time, Ben Cohen said that \"Jerry has a really big heart and this conflict with Unilever was breaking it.\"\"My heart leads me to continue to work inside the company to advocate for its independence so that it can actualise the social mission, the values that it was founded on and has maintained for over 40 years,\" he told the BBC's PM programme.",

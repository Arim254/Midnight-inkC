    "body": "The US National Park Service (NPS) is removing Martin Luther King Jr Day and Juneteenth from its list of fee-free entrance days.The move is part of President Donald Trump's \"modernisation\" of the park service, which, beginning in 2026, also includes changing the parks' cost structure to favour American citizens over foreign visitors, following a July executive order from Trump.In addition to removing the two holidays that celebrate civil rights leader MLK Jr and the end of slavery in the US, the agency is adding Flag Day, which is also Trump's birthday, as a \"patriotic\" fee-free day. People who are not US citizens will still have to pay fees on the fee-free dates, the NPS said.For the 2026 calendar year, US residents will be granted free access to national parks on President's Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day/President Trump's birthday, Independence Day weekend, 110th Birthday of the National Park Service, Constitution Day, Theodore Roosevelt's birthday and Veteran's Day.Previously, Martin Luther King Jr Day and Juneteenth were both deemed fee-free entry days by the Biden administration.Under the Trump administration's new rules, US residents will continue to pay $80 (£60) for an annual park service pass. But for non-residents, the cost will rise from $80 to to $250, the Department of the Interior, which oversees the park service, announced last month. Those without a  pass will now pay $100 per person, in addition to the standard entrance fee, at 11 of the most visited parks. \"President Trump's leadership always puts American families first,\" said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. \"These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations,\" Burgum's statement continued. In May, the department estimated in its budget proposal for 2026 fiscal year that surcharges for foreign visitors would bring in more than $90 million per year.  This is not the first time the Trump administration has targeted Juneteenth and MLK Jr Day. On his first day in office this year, Trump issued an executive order banning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes from federal agencies, which led many agencies to bar celebrations of holidays seen as DEI-related, including MLK Jr Day and Juneteenth. However, the two dates remain national holidays. In June, the Trump administration held a military parade in Washington DC to celebrate the US Army's 250th anniversary, which also happened to fall on both Flag Day and Trump's birthday. The BBC has contacted the White House for comment. ",

    "body": "A drone attack on the town of Kalogi, in Sudan's South Kordofan region, is said to have hit a kindergarten and killed at least 50 people, including 33 children. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the paramilitary group battling the army in Sudan's civil war, was accused of Thursday's attack by a medical organisation, the Sudan Doctors' Network, and the army.There was no immediate comment from the RSF. The RSF in turn accused the army of hitting a market on Friday in a drone attack in the Darfur region, on a fuel depot at the Adre border crossing with Chad.Sudan has been ravaged by war since April 2023 when a power struggle broke out between the RSF and the army, who were formerly allies .The reports could not be verified independently.   According to the army-aligned foreign ministry, the kindergarten was struck twice with missiles from drones.Civilians and medics who rushed to the school were also attacked, it added.Responding to reports of the attack in Kalogi, a spokesman for the UN children's agency Unicef said: \"Killing children in their school is a horrific violation of children's rights.\"\"Children should never pay the price of conflict,\" Sheldon Yett added.The agency, he said, urged \"all parties to stop these attacks immediately and allow safe, unhindered access for humanitarian assistance to reach those in desperate need\".The RSF accused the army of attacking the Adre crossing because it was used for the \"delivery of aid and commercial supplies\". According to the Sudan War Monitor, a group of researchers tracking the conflict, the attack caused civilian casualties and significant damage to a market.The military did not immediately comment on the reports from Darfur.Wedged between Sudan's capital Khartoum and Darfur, the region made up of North Kordofan, South Kordofan and West Kordofan has been a frontline in the civil war.The battle for the Kordofans - which have a population of almost eight million - has intensified as the army pushes towards Darfur.",

    "body": "The death toll in Indonesia from recent flooding has passed 900, with hundreds still missing.More than 100,000 homes were destroyed when a rare and powerful cyclone formed over the Malaca Strait last week, bringing torrential rain and landslides to parts of the South East Asian country.Efforts to reach people in areas still cut off are ongoing, with aid having to be airdropped into some places.The Indonesia floods were one of several extreme weather events to hit Asia in recent weeks, with the cumulative death toll in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam approaching 2,000. In Aceh Tamiang, one of the hardest-hit areas of Indonesia, survivors described villages being entirely swept away by fast-moving deluges.One survivor in Lintang Bawah Village told the BBC Indonesian service that people survived by sitting on top of their homes.Fitriana said: \"There were also those who survived on the roofs of their houses with their four-year-old children, for three days without eating or drinking.\"She said around 90% of the homes in her village were destroyed, leaving 300 families with nowhere to go.One man recounted how he and his family were evacuated by boat when the floodwaters inundated his home up to the second floor, only for them to need to flee again from a nearby village.He said: \"That night, while we were sleeping, water suddenly soaked the mattresses we were sleeping on [in Gampoeng Dalam Village]. But we couldn't go anywhere else, because there was no higher ground.\"Luckily, my daughter-in-law's house was on two levels. So we climbed upstairs and that's where we survived.\"The region's governor said response teams were still searching for bodies in \"waist-deep\" mud, according to the AFP news agency. He said: \"Many people need basic necessities. Many areas remain untouched in the remote areas of Aceh.\"People are not dying from the flood, but from starvation. That's how it is.\"Indonesian media reported inmates were released from one prison when floodwaters threatened to engulf the facility, with officials saying there was nowhere else for them to be sent.Land access to two areas, Sibolga City and Central Tapanuli, remained cut off as of Sunday, with aid only able to reach them by air and sea respectively. There have been reports of looting at supermarkets in some areas.",

    "body": "11 hours agoVikas Pandey,in Goa,Devina Gupta,in Delhi,andHarry SekulichWatch: BBC reports from scene of deadly Goa nightclub fireA fire at a popular nightclub in India's coastal region of Goa has killed 25 people, local officials say. Police had initially thought a gas cylinder in the Birch nightclub's kitchen exploded – but the region's chief minister said on Sunday that this had been ruled out and that indoor fireworks were now thought to be the cause of the blaze.The venue, located near a popular beach, was packed with revellers who had come to hear a Bollywood DJ. Four members of the same Delhi family and 21 staff died, police said.Four people have been arrested, including the nightclub's manager, and an arrest warrant for the owner has also been issued.Goa is a former Portuguese colony on the Arabian Sea. Its nightlife, sandy beaches, and resorts attract millions of tourists annually.Eyewitnesses told the BBC of scenes of panic in the bustling nightlife area.One said that he had been outside the club on what was a usual Saturday night with holidaymakers enjoying themselves when he heard screams.\"I didn't initially understand what was going on,\" he said. \"In a bit, it became clear that a massive fire had broken out. The scenes were just horrific.\" Though the main entrance is wide, the crossing over a small lake leading to the main structure is narrow and that made it difficult for firefighters to reach the spot.The BBC saw what appeared to be melted remains of chairs, tables and plants in one corner of the club.EPAPolice believe a gas cylinder exploded in the club's kitchen, causing a blaze to rip through the venueGoa's chief minister Pramod Sawant told journalists three people had died from burns, while most of the others had died of suffocation. Six people are in a stable condition in hospital.Officials said 20 of the workers who died were from the Indian states of Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Karnataka. One worker was from Nepal.A chef who works at a nearby venue told the BBC he knew some of the workers at the Birch club.\"People from all over the country and also from Nepal work in different clubs in Goa,\" he said.\"I am really worried for some people who I knew at the club. Their phones are off.On Sunday, emergency teams were combing through the charred wreckage.An inquiry into the cause of the fire has been launched, Sawant said, and a full report into the incident will be released within a week.\"Those found responsible will face most stringent action under the law – any negligence will be dealt with firmly,\" Dr Sawant added.India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the Goa fire \"deeply saddening\" in a post on social media.A rescue operation and investigation was ongoing at the Goa nightclub on Sunday morningAbout 5.5 million tourists visited Goa in the first half of the year, government data showed, with 270,000 coming from abroad.Some opposition politicians told the BBC that stricter regulations were needed to avoid such tragedies.They alleged that newer clubs were opening too frequently and the government needed to ensure they were safe for people to visit.India has seen a number of deadly fires at entertainment venues in recent years.A fire at a three-storey building killed 17 in the southern city of Hyderabad in May, while a hotel blaze in north-east Kolkata left 15 dead a month earlier.Last year, 24 died at an amusement park arcade in the western state of Gujarat after visitors were trapped inside. An official review later found poor safety standards contributed to the death toll.here.",

    "body": "Russia has welcomed US President Donald Trump's new National Security Strategy, calling it \"largely consistent\" with Moscow's vision. The 33-page document, unveiled by the US administration this week, suggests Europe is facing \"civilisational erasure\" and does not cast Russia as a threat to the US. Combatting foreign influence, ending mass migration, and rejecting the EU's perceived practice of \"censorship\" are mentioned as other priorities in the report. Several EU officials and analysts had pushed back on the strategy, questioning its focus on freedom of expression and likening it to language used by the Kremlin. \"The adjustments we're seeing... are largely consistent with our vision,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in an interview published by Russia's state news agency Tass on Sunday. \"We consider this a positive step,\" he said, adding that Moscow would continue to analyse the document before drawing strong conclusions. The strategy adopts a softer language towards Russia, which EU officials worry could weaken its stance towards Moscow as it pushes for an end to the war in Ukraine. In the document, the EU is blamed for blocking US efforts to end the conflict and says that the US must \"re-establish strategic stability to Russia\" which would \"stabilise European economies\".It appears to endorse efforts to influence policy on the continent, noting that US policy should prioritise \"resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations\".The new report also calls for the restoration of \"Western identity\", and claims that Europe will be \"unrecognisable in 20 years or less\" and its economic issues are \"eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilisational erasure\".\"It is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies,\" the document states.In stark contrast, the document celebrates the influence of \"patriotic European parties\" and says \"America encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit\".As the EU engages in ongoing talks with the Trump administration to set out a peace deal in Ukraine, some officials emphasised their lasting relationship with the US, while raising \"questions\" over the document. \"The US will remain our most important ally in the [Nato] alliance. This alliance, however, is focused on addressing security policy issues,\" German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Friday. \"I believe questions of freedom of expression or the organisation of our free societies do not belong [in the strategy], in any case at least when it comes to Germany.\"In a social media post addressed to his \"American friends\", Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that \"Europe is your closest ally, not your problem\" and noted their \"common enemies\".\"This is the only reasonable strategy of our common security. Unless something has changed.\"Meanwhile, former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt wrote that the document \"places itself to the right of the extreme right\".The Trump administration has fostered links with the far-right AfD party in Germany, which has been classified as extreme right by German intelligence.Promoting an \"America First\" message, the strategy says the US intends to target alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean, considering possible military action in Venezuela.The US also calls on an increased defence spending from Japan, South Korea, Australia and Taiwan.Democrats in Congress warned that the document could shatter US foreign relations. Representative Jason Crow of Colorado, who sits on House committees overseeing intelligence and the armed forces, called the strategy \"catastrophic to America's standing in the world\".New York Representative Gregory Meeks said it \"discards decades of value-based, US leadership\".",

    "body": "The US has criticised the Venezuelan government over the death of an opposition figure in custody, calling it a \"reminder of the vile nature\" of President Nicolás Maduro's regime.Alfredo Díaz died in his prison cell at the El Helicoide prison in Caracas where he was being held for more than a year, human rights organisations and opposition groups have said.The Venezuelan government said the 56-year-old showed signs of a heart attack and was taken to hospital, where he died on Saturday.The US intervention is the latest in an escalating war of words between the Trump administration and Maduro, who has accused it of seeking regime change.In recent months, the US has increased its military presence in the region and has carried out a series of deadly strikes on boats it says have been used for smuggling drugs.US President Donald Trump has accused Maduro himself of being the head of one of the region's drug cartels - an allegation the Venezuelan president vehemently denies - and threatened military action \"by land\".Why is Trump threatening Venezuela's Maduro?The US State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said Díaz had been \"arbitrarily detained\" in a \"torture centre\".Díaz was detained in 2024 after being among many opposition figures to dispute the results of that year's presidential election.Venezuela's government-controlled election council declared Maduro the winner, despite opposition tallies showing their candidate had won by a landslide.The elections were widely dismissed on the international stage as neither free nor fair, and sparked protests across the country.Díaz, the former governor of the Nueva Esparta state, a collection of islands off Venezuela's Caribbean coastline, was accused of \"incitement to hatred\" and \"terrorism\" for questioning Maduro's claim to victory.The Venezuelan human rights group Foro Penal has raised concerns over deteriorating conditions for political prisoners in the Latin American nation. \"Another political prisoner has died in Venezuelan jails. He had been imprisoned for a year, in solitary confinement,\" Alfredo Romero, the organisation's president, wrote on X.He said that Díaz had only been allowed one visit from his daughter during the entire length of his incarceration. He added that 17 political prisoners have died in the country since 2014.Opposition groups have also criticised the government over the death of Diaz. María Corina Machado, a prominent opposition leader who won this year's Nobel Peace Prize but who remains in hiding to avoid arrest, said Díaz's death was not an isolated incident. \"Sadly, it adds to an alarming and painful chain of deaths of political prisoners detained in the context of the post-election repression,\" she wrote on X. Machado, a vocal critic of Maduro's government who was integral to galvanising the opposition against him, will likely be absent from the Nobel Prize-giving ceremony in Oslo on Wednesday. Venezuela's attorney general said last month that she would be considered a \"fugitive\" if she travelled to Norway. The Democratic Unitary Platform, an opposition alliance, said Díaz \"died unjustly\".Diaz's own political party, Democratic Action (AD), also paid tribute to the former governor, saying he had been unjustly detained without due process and had remained in conditions \"that should never have violated his fundamental rights\". Tensions between the US and Venezuela have become increasingly strained over what Trump has described as efforts to stem the flow of drugs and migrants into the US.US air strikes on vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific have killed more than 80 people.Trump has accused Maduro of \"emptying his prisons and insane asylums\" into the US, and designated two Venezuelan drug cartels - Tren de Aragua and Cartel de los Soles - as terrorist organisations, the latter of which Trump alleged Maduro led.Maduro has in turn accused the US of using its war on drugs as an excuse to depose his socialist government and get its hands on Venezuela's vast oil reserves. Colombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro has said the US strikes were an attempt to \"dominate\" Latin America.The US has also stationed a large naval force - its largest deployment in the region in decades - along with thousands of troops.The Venezuelan army reportedly swore in more than 5,600 soldiers in one go on Saturday, in response to what military leaders called US \"threats\". The same day, the Venezuelan government said that Maduro and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had agreed to resume Turkish Airlines flights between the two nations.The carrier was one of six major international airlines to have their landing licences revoked after temporarily suspending flights to Caracas over a US warning of \"heightened military activity\" in the area.",

    "body": "A National Guardsman is on the mend after he was critically injured in an ambush-style shooting last month in Washington DC. The parents of Andrew Wolfe, 24, say \"his head wound is slowly healing and that he's beginning to 'look more like himself'\", said West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey. The family expects the Air Force staff sergeant to be in acute care for the next two to three weeks, and they feel optimistic about his progress, Morrisey said in a statement.Staff Sgt Wolfe was one of two West Virginia National Guard members shot when a gunman opened fire not far from the White House on 26 November. His colleague, 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom, died from her injuries. \"We continue to ask all West Virginians and Americans for their prayers!\" the governor said in his statement. Morrisey attended a vigil on Friday evening for Staff Sgt Wolfe at Musselman High School in Inwood, West Virginia, where the guardsman was once a student.A pastor at the vigil read a message from the soldier's parents, Jason and Melody Wolfe.\"We know that there is a long road to go,\" they wrote, according to local news outlet Metro News. \"But our faith keeps us hopeful. We remain grateful for the prayers and the support from people all over the world.\"Earlier in the week, the governor said Staff Sgt Wolfe had responded to a nurse with a thumbs-up and was able to move his toes.Police have charged the suspected shooter, an Afghan national named Rahmanullah Lakanwal, with first-degree murder and assault with intent to kill.Before coming to the US in 2021, he was once a counterterrorism soldier in a CIA-backed unit that worked with American troops in Afghanistan.Staff Sgt Wolfe was one of 2,000 National Guard members whom President Donald Trump deployed to the nation's capitol in August as part of his immigration and crime-related crackdown in Democratic-led cities. Following the shooting, Trump said he wanted another 500 National Guard troops sent to the nation's capital. The Trump administration has also cited the shooting as a reason for additional immigration crackdown measures.They have cancelled all citizenship ceremonies for immigrants from 19 countries that were part of a travel ban announced over the summer, including Afghanistan.

    "body": "1 day agoSebastian UsherBBC Middle East analystThe Iranian judiciary says two organisers of a marathon have been arrested for allowing women who were not wearing hijabs to take part.The move comes after images appeared online of unveiled women competing in the race on Friday.Around 2,000 women and 3,000 men took part separately in the marathon on Kish Island off the southern coast of Iran.Dressed in red t-shirts, some of the female competitors were clearly not wearing the hijab or any other head covering.This drew very different reactions. Many supporters of change in Iran enthusiastically hailed the images as further evidence of Iranian women rejecting the restrictions placed by the authorities on what they can wear.For their part, Iranian officials have responded to it as an unacceptable challenge to the status quo.The judiciary has moved quickly against the organisers.It is not just the flouting of the rules on the hijab by some female competitors but that the marathon was held at all that has drawn condemnation from the country theocratic Islamic leadership.Just a few years ago, the sight of so many Iranian women in sports gear participating in such a mass public event – even if segregated from male participants – would have been seen as a contravention.The prosecutor in Kish said the way that the race was being held was in itself a \"violation of public decency\". The issue of the hijab remains at the heart of the debate on where Iran might be going.Government action against women appearing in public without a head covering has varied - sometimes permitting a loosening of the rules, at others mounting a clampdown on any transgression.The mass protests that rocked Iran for months three years ago were triggered by the death of the young Kurdish Iranian woman, Mahsa Amini, who died in custody after being detained over an alleged breach of the dress code.Since the protests were quelled through force and mass arrests, some Iranian women have continued to defy the rules.That has prompted a recent pushback by the authorities.The head of the judiciary has warned of a renewed campaign against women not wearing the hijab in public.Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said that intelligence agencies had been ordered to identify and report on what he called \"organised trends promoting immorality and non-veiling\". There is clearly no end for now in the standoff between Iran's leaders and many of its own people – particularly in the younger generation – over how women are allowed to dress.",

    "body": "A protective shield covering the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in Ukraine can no longer provide its main containment function following a drone strike earlier this year, according to a UN watchdog.  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors found that the massive structure, built over the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster, had lost its \"primary safety functions including the confinement capability\".In February, Ukraine accused Russia of targeting the power plant - a claim the Kremlin denied.The IAEA said repairs were \"essential\" to \"prevent further degradation\" of the nuclear shelter. However environmental expert Jim Smith told the BBC: \"It is not something to panic about.\"Prof Smith from the University of Portsmouth in the UK, who has studied the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster, said the biggest danger linked to the site was disturbing radioactive dust.But he said that \"the risk is low\" because contaminated dust is contained within a thick concrete \"sarcophagus\" which is covered by the protective shield. The 1986 explosion at Chernobyl blasted radioactive material into the air, triggering a public health emergency across Europe.In response, the former Soviet Union constructed the sarcophagus over the nuclear reactor. The sarcophagus only had a 30-year lifespan, prompting the need for the protective shell to prevent radioactive material leaking out over the next 100 years.The IAEA said a team had completed a safety assessment of the site last week after it was \"severely damaged\" by the drone strike. The attack caused a fire in the outer cladding of the steel structure.Inspectors said there was no permanent damage to shell's load-bearing structures or monitoring systems and some repairs had been carried out on the roof.But IAEA director general Rafael Grossi, said: \"Timely and comprehensive restoration remains essential to prevent further degradation and ensure long-term nuclear safety.\"Since the beginning of December, the UN's nuclear watchdog has been assessing Ukraine's energy infrastructure as the country continues to defend itself against Russia.Overnight, Russia launched airstrikes on the city of Kremenchuk, a major industrial hub in the centre of Ukraine. As well as assessing Chernobyl, the IAEA has been inspecting electrical substations linked to nuclear safety and security.Mr Grossi said: \"They are absolutely indispensable for providing the electricity all nuclear power plants need for reactor cooling and other safety systems.\"They are also needed to distribute the electricity that they produce to households and industry.\"",

    "body": "17 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterKaty Perry and former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have gone Instagram official after the singer posted a string of photographs and videos of their trip to Japan.In one picture, Perry and Trudeau are seen smiling for a selfie, with their faces touching. In another video, the pair are seen trying sushi.Neither Perry nor Trudeau have publicly commented on their relationship. But speculation has been growing for months with multiple pictures of the two together.Trudeau was seen attending Perry's concert earlier this year, fuelling rumours of a romance with the pop star.Perry was visiting Japan as part of her global Lifetimes Tour.The 41-year-old accompanied her Instagram carousel with the caption: \"Tokyo times on tour and more.\"Earlier this week, Trudeau, 53, also reposted a photograph of the pair together alongside the former prime minister of Japan, Fumio Kishida, and his wife, Yuko.He wrote on X: \"Great to see you [Fumio Kishida]. Katy and I were so glad to have the chance to sit down with you and Yuko.\"Thank you, Fumio, for your friendship and your continued commitment to both the international rules-based order and to a better future for everyone.\"Last month, the pair appeared to confirm their relationship after being photographed holding hands at an event in Paris.Celebrity news site TMZ published the photographs and video footage of the pair walking hand-in-hand before getting into a car. Trudeau was seen helping the singer into the back seat as photographers called out.The appearance in Paris coincided with Perry's 41st birthday and appeared to mark their first public outing as a couple.Perry and Trudeau did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.During a recent tour in London, Perry did appear to allude to her relationship status.After a fan proposed to her from the audience during a performance, the singer joked: \"I wish you'd asked me 48 hours ago.\" This was just days after photographs of her and Trudeau were first published online.Perry was previously in a long-term relationship with actor Orlando Bloom. The pair, who were together for a decade and share a daughter, separated over the summer.Trudeau, who served as prime minister of Canada from 2015 to 2025, was previously married to Sophie Grégoire for 18 years before the couple split up in the summer of 2023. They share three children.",

    "body": "Donald Trump has slammed Democrat Henry Cuellar's \"lack of loyalty\" for not defecting to the Republican party after he was pardoned by the US president. In issuing his pardon on Wednesday, Trump said the Texas representative - who was charged last year with bribery and money laundering - had been politically targeted by the Biden administration after he \"bravely spoke out against Open Borders\". Hours after he was pardoned, Cuellar filed for re-election as a Democrat, dashing Republicans' hope that he might switch parties and pad their narrow majority in the House of Representatives.\"Such a lack of LOYALTY,\" Trump wrote of Cuellar on social media. \"Oh' well, next time, no more Mr. Nice guy!\"The Justice Department, under the Biden administration, charged that Cuellar and his wife had accepted $600,000 (£450,600) from Azerbaijan's state-owned oil company and an unnamed Mexican bank in exchange for advancing their interests in Congress. The couple, who have maintained their innocence, were charged with 14 counts in 2024, including conspiracy, bribery, wire fraud, money laundering and violating a ban on acting as agents of a foreign organisation.In his Sunday social media post, Trump accused \"radical left\" Democrats of \"mercilessly\" going after Cuellar - who is a moderate Democrat - in an \"evil quest\" to \"destroy\" him and his family \"all because Henry strongly wanted, correctly, BORDER SECURITY!\"Trump said in the lengthy post that he had never spoken to the congressman or his family but \"felt very good about fighting\" for his family because they were \"treated sooo BADLY!\" Trump added that despite his pardon, Cuellar decided to run again as a Democrat, \"continuing to work with the same Radical Left Scum that just weeks before wanted him and his wife to spend the rest of their lives in Prison - And probably still do!\"And that \"lack of loyalty\", Trump wrote, would not sit well with Texas voters or with Cuellar's daughters, who had written a letter to the president urging him to pardon their parents. Still, Cuellar doubled down on his intentions to remain in the Democratic party, telling Fox News on Sunday: \"I'm an American, I'm a Texan and I'm a Democrat - in that order.\"When asked to respond to Trump's social media post, Cuellar said: \"I am a conservative Democrat, but I will work with the president.\"Cuellar added that Trump was on his mind while he attended church on Sunday morning. \"I prayed for the president,\" he said. \"I prayed for his family, and I prayed for the presidency because if the president succeeds, the country succeeds.\" Trump's attack on Cuellar is the latest example of the president expecting loyalty from those he helps.   A group of federal labour unions filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration last month over what they called a \"loyalty question\" included in thousands of federal job applications. The question asks applicants to identify Trump policy initiatives that are significant to them, and to describe how they personally would advance Trump's agenda. Trump has long that said loyalty is the most important thing to him. \"I value loyalty above everything else - more than brains, more than drive, and more than energy,\" he once said.  ",

    "body": "Russian air strikes on Ukraine have continued overnight, hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had a \"very constructive\" phone call with Donald Trump's negotiating team following three days of talks in Florida.Early on Sunday the mayor of Kremenchuk, a major industrial hub in central Ukraine, said the city had been repeatedly struck in a \"massive\" attack. No deaths have been confirmed so far.Meanwhile, Russia said it had shot down 77 Ukrainian drones in several locations.Aerial assaults have persisted even as efforts to negotiate an end to the war have intensified, including detailed Ukraine-US talks in Miami aimed at drafting a peace settlement acceptable to both sides.Zelensky said on Saturday that he was \"determined\" to continue working with the US after speaking to Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the US president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, at the conclusion of those negotiations. He added that they had discussed how to ensure Russia stuck to any potential deal to end the war.Hours later, Kremenchuk Mayor Vitaliy Maletsk said his city had sustained a \"massive combined strike\" on its infrastructure. The extent of the damage was unclear as of Sunday morning but the mayor said water, electricity and heating had been cut off for some.The city, which is roughly halfway between Kyiv and the frontline in the east, has been repeatedly targeted since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.The White House has pushed Kyiv and Moscow to agree to a multi-point plan to end the war but there has been little sign of a breakthrough, despite both sides engaging with the US-led process.\"Ukraine is determined to keep working in good faith with the American side to genuinely achieve peace,\" Zelensky said on X. \"We covered many aspects and went through key points that could ensure an end to the bloodshed and eliminate the threat of a new Russian full scale invasion.\"The Russian strikes in the early hours of Sunday followed a wider attack 24 hours earlier, which drew condemnation from Kyiv's European allies.In a social media post, French President Emmanuel Macron said he had spoken to Zelensky and offered his \"full solidarity\". \"France is determined to work with all partners to secure de-escalation measures and to impose a ceasefire,\" Macron added. Macron, Zelensky, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are due to hold in-person talks in London on Monday.European leaders have pushed back against early versions of the US-led peace plan and have sought to win support from the White House for their own proposals, such as comprehensive security guarantees for a post-war Ukraine, including the possibility of a peacekeeping force.Sir Keir has led the push for a so-called \"coalition of the willing\", a loose collection of Ukrainian allies who are committed to continuing to underwrite Kyiv's defence in the event of a ceasefire to deter a second invasion. He has called that proposal \"vital\" for Ukraine's long-term security.Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected the idea of such a force, saying any troops deployed to Ukraine would be \"legitimate targets\".Also on Saturday, US and Ukrainian negotiators urged Russia to show a \"serious commitment to long-term peace\".The joint statement was issued days after Witkoff returned from talks with Putin at the Kremlin which failed to produce a breakthrough.Witkoff and Rustem Umerov, newly installed as Zelensky's most senior negotiator, said they had \"agreed on the framework of security arrangements\" and \"discussed necessary deterrence capabilities to sustain a lasting peace\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoSuranjana TewariAsia Business Correspondent, TokyoBBCScientists at Waseda University in Tokyo are developing caregiving robotsLast year, more than 18,000 older people living with dementia left their homes and wandered off in Japan. Almost 500 were later found dead.Police say such cases have doubled since 2012. Elderly people aged 65 and over now make up nearly 30% of Japan's population - the second-highest proportion in the world after Monaco, according to the World Bank. The crisis is further compounded by a shrinking workforce and tight limits on foreign workers coming in to provide care.Japan's government has identified dementia as one of its most urgent policy challenges, with the Health Ministry estimating that dementia-related health and social care costs will reach 14 trillion yen ($90bn; £67bn) by 2030 - up from nine trillion yen in 2025. In its most recent strategy, the government has signalled a stronger pivot toward technology to ease the pressure.Across the country, people are adopting GPS-based systems to keep track of those who wander.Some regions offer wearable GPS tags that can alert authorities the moment a person leaves a designated area.In some towns, convenience-store workers receive real-time notifications – a kind of community safety net that can locate a missing person within hours.Robot caregivers and AIOther technologies aim to detect dementia earlier.Fujitsu's aiGait uses AI to analyse posture and walking patterns, picking up early signs of dementia – shuffling while walking, slower turns or difficulty standing – generating skeletal outlines clinicians can review during routine check-ups.\"Early detection of age-related diseases is key,\" says Hidenori Fujiwara, a Fujitsu spokesperson. \"If doctors can use motion-capture data, they can intervene earlier and help people remain active for longer.\"Meanwhile, researchers at Waseda University are developing AIREC, a 150kg humanoid robot designed to be a \"future\" caregiver. It can help a person put on socks, scramble eggs and fold laundry. The scientists at Waseda University hope that in the future, AIREC will be able to change diapers and prevent bedsores in patients.Toshio Morita (R) works at the Restaurant of Mistaken OrdersSimilar robots are already being used in care homes to play music to residents or guide them in simple stretching exercises.They are also monitoring patients at night - placed under mattresses to track sleep and conditions - and cutting back on the need for humans doing the rounds.Although humanoid robots are being developed for the near future, Assistant Professor Tamon Miyake says the level of precision and intelligence required will take at last five years before they are safely able to interact with humans.\"It requires full-body sensing and adaptive understanding - how to adjust for each person and situation,\" he says.Emotional support is also part of the innovation drive.Poketomo, a 12cm tall robot, can be carried around in a bag or can fit into a pocket. It reminds users to take medication, tells you how to prepare in real time for the weather outside and offers conversation for those living alone, which its creators say helps to ease social isolation.\"We're focusing on social issues... and to use new technology to help solve those problems,\" Miho Kagei, development manager from Sharp told the BBC.While devices and robots offer new ways to assist, human connection remains irreplaceable.\"Robots should supplement, not substitute, human caregivers,\" Mr Miyake, the Waseda University scientist said. \"While they may take over some tasks, their main role is to assist both caregivers and patients.\"At the Restaurant of Mistaken Orders in Sengawa, Tokyo, founded by Akiko Kanna, people stream in to be served by patients suffering from dementia.Inspired by her father's experience with the condition, Ms Kanna wanted a place where people could remain engaged and feel purposeful.Toshio Morita, one of the café's servers, uses flowers to remember which table ordered what.Despite his cognitive decline, Mr Morita enjoys the interaction. For his wife, the café provides respite and helps keep him engaged.Kanna's café illustrates why social interventions and community support remain essential. Technology can provide tools and relief, but meaningful engagement and human connection are what truly sustain people living with dementia.\"Honestly? I wanted a little pocket money. I like meeting all sorts of people,\" Mr Morita says. \"Everyone's different - that's what makes it fun.\"Getty ImagesSharp's Poketomo robot has been designed to give companionship to patientsAdditional reporting by Jaltson Akkanath Chummar",

All of the candidates have been vetted to ensure they are loyal to China.Voter turnout was 31.9%, according to the city's electoral office. The last election in 2021 saw the administrative region's lowest-ever turnout of 30% amid widespread voter apathy.This election took place as many were mourning a devastating fire in Hong Kong's Tai Po district last month that killed nearly 160 people.Around 1.3 million voted out of around 4.1 million registered voters in the city, which has a population of more than seven million. China earlier made sweeping changes to Hong Kong's electoral system to ensure only \"patriots\" could run for seats. Beijing has said the changes, which were put in place after anti-government protests in 2019, were necessary to ensure stability in Hong Kong, but critics say they weakened democracy.Ahead of the recent election, authorities distributed aid to survivors of the Tai Po fire, arrested suspects and sought to improve building safety, as some Hongkongers raised questions about the incident.A total of 161 candidates competed for 90 seats in the LegCo, which acts as a mini parliament and can make and amend laws. Twenty of those are directly elected, while nearly half are picked by the pro-Beijing Election Committee and the rest chosen by special interest groups like business and trade.This year, the government has blanketed the city with posters urging Hongkongers to head to the polls, while dangling freebies and shopping discounts.After casting their vote, each person received a \"thank you card\" that could be redeemed for vouchers in selected shops and restaurants, or for beauty services, medical check-ups and insurance policy premiums.Authorities also offered free entry to public swimming pools and museums on polling day, organising carnivals in various neighbourhoods, and holding a televised variety show and gala. They have also created cartoon mascots and a theme tune for the election, adapted from a 2001 hit song by Cantopop star Aaron Kwok, called \"Let's Vote, Together We Create The Future\".Hong Kong's Chief Secretary Eric Chan told reporters last month that the measures were aimed at ensuring \"a happy and festive mood\" and to \"let residents recognise the importance of the election\".VCG via Getty ImagesThe Hong Kong government has launched a campaign urging residents to voteBut in recent days focus has been on the 26 November fire that engulfed high-rise residential blocks at Wang Fuk Court in the northerly suburban district of Tai Po.The blaze was the worst seen in Hong Kong in more than 70 years. The death toll, which currently stands at 159, is likely to rise further as officials continue to recover bodies.As Hong Kong mourns its dead, some are asking whether the fire could have been prevented and questioning building safety standards. Many Hongkongers live in ageing high-rise buildings similar to Wang Fuk Court.Authorities have since ordered the creation of an independent committee to investigate the cause of the fire, and have arrested 13 people on suspicion of manslaughter. They have also ordered the removal of scaffolding mesh used in all building renovations across the city. Investigators have found that a scaffolding mesh used for renovations in Wang Fuk Court failed to meet flame retardant standards - and that the fire spread quickly due to the mesh and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings.Authorities have also moved quickly to quell dissent. Police have reportedly detained a man, who was part of a group petitioning for an independent inquiry, for suspected sedition on Saturday. The petition was also wiped from the internet.Two other people, including a former district councillor, were also taken in by police.VCG via Getty ImagesHong Kong has been blanketed with posters for the Legco electionPolitical campaigning for the LegCo election was immediately suspended following the fire, though government-organised debate forums resumed after a few days. Carnivals organised for the election campaign were also cancelled.Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee insisted the LegCo election continued as planned as \"we must move forward before we can turn our grief into strength\".He said that the new legislators would be able to quickly support reconstruction and reforms.John P Burns, an emeritus professor and Chinese politics expert at the University of Hong Kong, said he believed the government would interpret a high turnout as a sign that voters perceive Hong Kong's reshaped political system as \"relatively legitimate\".But he expected the numbers to be low, in part due to the Tai Po fire.He pointed out that most Hongkongers have traditionally supported the pan-democrat opposition - which have effectively been barred from taking part. \"I think they won't be convinced to participate this time, just as they mostly stayed away in 2021.\"Mobilising pro-establishment voters following the fire would be difficult for the government as well, he added.Some in that camp will be impressed by how authorities have speedily re-housed those made homeless in the fire and the aid authorities have provided, \"which by any measure has been rapid and relatively generous\", noted Prof Burns.But others may have stayed away from the polls as they were \"disappointed, even angry, by the governance problems the fire has exposed\", he said.Hong Kong's national security office this week reposted a commentary from a pro-Beijing news outlet that urged residents to vote to show support for government's reconstruction efforts.\"Building a good future together starts with this vote. If you truly love Hong Kong, you should sincerely vote,\" the commentary said.This year's LegCo election featured a number of new faces, with about a quarter of the incumbent lawmakers stepping down.Local media reports that Beijing pressured several lawmakers to retire as it had unofficially set an age limit. A number of those stepping down are aged above 70, including the prominent politician Regina Ip, a former security chief nicknamed the \"Iron Lady\".",

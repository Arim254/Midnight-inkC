    "body": "A suspect has been arrested after footage which appears to capture the alleged attempted rape of a woman on a train near Paris went viral, local media say. Jhordana Dias, a 26-year-old Brazilian national, was allegedly attacked earlier this month. She told Le Parisien newspaper that the man boarded the train, pushed her and attempted to pull down her underwear. Alerted by her screams, another passenger pulled out her phone to film. The  footage captures a man fleeing as the train pulls into a station. The incident has revived discussions around women's safety in France.According to French media, a man was arrested on Friday evening by transport police in Mantes-la-Jolie, north-west of Paris. He was traced there by investigators, but it is unclear how.He was not carrying identity documentation at the time of his arrest, but told police he was a 26-year-old Egyptian national, media reports say. He remains in custody.The alleged incident took place on 15 October between the Choisy-le-Roi and Villeneuve-le-Roi train stations, south-east of Paris.The video shows shows a man dressed in a black tracksuit and cap onboard a carriage.Over the sound of a woman's cries, the woman filming can be heard saying \"you stay there\" as the man appears to begin approaching her.The train then pulls into a station, and the man disembarks and flees down the platform.The woman who filmed the incident, named in French media only as Marguerite, has since been widely credited as having saved Ms Dias from a more serious attack.Ms Dias, who does not speak French, reportedly filed a complaint with police in Choisy-le-Roi with the help of her brother, who translated her testimony.The footage has been widely circulated on news outlets and social media. prompting many women to share their own experiences of harassment on public transport in France.Two other women have since told Le Parisian that they had been victims of the same man.",

    "body": "15 hours agoYolande Knell and Jacob Evans,in JerusalemBBCThree year-old Zain Tafesh died from leukemia earlier this weekSo many lives in Gaza still hang in the balance.In different wards of Nasser Hospital lie two 10-year-old boys, one shot by Israeli fire and paralysed from the neck down, another with a brain tumour.Now that a fragile ceasefire is in place, they are among some 15,000 patients who the World Health Organization (WHO) says are in need of urgent medical evacuations.Amar Abu Said is paralysed from the neck and needs specialist treatmentOla Abu Said sits gently stroking the hair of her son, Amar.  His family says he was in their tent in southern Gaza when he was hit by a stray bullet fired by an Israeli drone.  It is lodged between two of his vertebrae, leaving him paralysed.\"He needs surgery urgently,\" Ola says, \"but it's complicated.  Doctors told us it could cause his death, a stroke or brain haemorrhage.  He needs surgery in a well-equipped place.\"Right now, Gaza is anything but that.  After two years of war, its hospitals have been left in a critical state.Ahmed al-Jadd and his sister Shahd lost their father in the warSitting by the bedside of her younger brother, Ahmed al-Jadd, his sister Shahd says her brother was a constant comfort to her through two years of war and displacement.\"He's only 10 and, when our situation got so bad, he used to go out and sell water to help bring some money for us,\" she says.  A few months ago, he showed the first signs of ill health.\"Ahmad's mouth started drooping to one side,\" Shahd explains. \"One time he kept telling me, 'Shahd my head hurts', and we just gave him paracetamol, but later, his right hand stopped moving.\"The one-time university student is desperate for her brother to travel abroad to have his tumour removed.\"We can't lose him. We already lost our father, our home and our dreams,\" Shahd says. \"When the ceasefire happened it gave us a bit of a hope that maybe there was a 1% chance that Ahmed could travel and get treated.\"ReutersInternational agencies are desperate to increase the number of evacuationsOn Wednesday, the WHO co-ordinated the first medical convoy to exit Gaza since the fragile ceasefire began on 10 October.  It took 41 patients and 145 carers to hospitals abroad via Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing, with ambulances and buses taking the group on to Jordan.  Some have stayed for care there.The UN agency has called for numbers of medical evacuations to be rapidly increased to deal with the thousands of cases of sick and wounded.  It wants to be able to bring out patients through Gaza's Rafah border crossing with Egypt as it has done previously.However, Israel has said it is keeping the crossing closed until Hamas \"fulfils\" its commitments under the terms of the Gaza ceasefire deal by returning the bodies of deceased hostages. Israel has kept the Gaza side of the Egyptian border closed since May 2024 when it took control during the war.Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, the head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said \"the most impactful measure\" would be if Israel could allow Gazan patients to be treated in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as happened before the war.Top EU officials and foreign ministers of more than 20 countries - including the UK - have previously called for this, offering \"financial contributions, provision of medical staff or equipment needed\".A funeral was held for eight-year old Saadi Abu Taha who died this week from stomach cancer\"Hundreds of patients could be treated easily and efficiently in a short time if this route reopened to the East Jerusalem Hospital Network and the hospitals in the West Bank,\" says Dr Fadi Atrash, CEO of the Augusta Victoria Hospital on the Mount of Olives.\"We can at least treat 50 patients per day for chemotherapy and radiation and even more than that.  Other hospitals can do a lot of surgeries,\" the doctor told me.\"Referring them to East Jerusalem is the shortest distance, the most efficient way, because we have the mechanism. We speak the same language, we're the same culture, in many cases we have medical files for Gazan patients.  They've been receiving treatment in East Jerusalem hospitals for more than a decade before the war.\"The BBC asked Cogat, the Israeli defence body which controls Gaza's crossings, why the medical route was not being approved.  Cogat said it was a decision by the political echelon and referred queries to the prime minister's office, which did not offer further explanation.After the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023, Israel cited security reasons for not allowing Gazan patients in other Palestinian territories.  It also pointed out that its main crossing point for people at Erez had been targeted by Hamas fighters during the assault.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says that in the year to August 2025, at least 740 people, including nearly 140 children, died while on waiting lists.At Nasser hospital, the director of paediatrics and maternity, Dr Ahmed al-Farra, expresses his frustration.\"It's the most difficult feeling for a doctor to be present, able to diagnose a condition but unable to carry out essential tests and lacking the necessary treatments,\" Dr al-Farra says. \"This has happened in so many cases, and unfortunately, there's daily loss of life due to our lack of capabilities.\"Since the ceasefire, hope has run out for more of his patients.In the past week in the hospital grounds, a funeral took place for Saadi Abu Taha, aged eight, who died from intestinal cancer.A day later, three-year old Zain Tafesh and Luay Dweik, aged eight, died from hepatitis.Without action, there are many more Gazans who will not have a chance to live in peace.",

    "body": "Connolly declared president of Ireland after landslide win13 minutes agoAuryn CoxBBC News NICatherine Connolly: \"I will be an inclusive president for all\"Catherine Connolly has been elected as the president of Ireland after a landslide victory.She has become the 10th president of the Republic of Ireland after defeating Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys, who had already conceded to her rival.The result, long clear from early tallies, was officially declared at Dublin Castle.Connolly – an independent who was backed by the major left-wing parties – pledged to be \"an inclusive president for all\" in her acceptance speech.The 68-year-old, from Galway, has been a TD (member of the Irish parliament) since 2016.She will be the country's 10th president, taking over from Michael D Higgins who has served the maximum two terms in officeConnolly secured 914,143 first preference votes (63%), the largest amount in Irish presidential election history. She made her acceptance speech first in Irish and then in English.\"I will be a president who listens and reflects and who speaks when it's necessary,\" she said.\"I will be a voice for peace, a voice that builds on our policy of neutrality, a voice that articulates the existential threat posed by climate change, and a voice that recognises the tremendous work being done the length and breadth of the country.\"Dublin correspondent Gabija Gataveckaite said Connolly was the anti-establishment candidate who took on Humphreys, the government's pick.She said in recent weeks, Connolly had been insisting her campaign was a \"movement\" and she has now won a clear mandate from the people.ReutersHeather Humphreys shook hands with Catherine Connolly, whose family joined her on the stageHumphreys, who spoke after Connolly, thanked everyone who voted for her, her campaign team and Fine Gael for the nomination.\"I know Catherine will be a president for all of us. Catherine will be my president and I want to wish her well, this is her evening,\" she said.The president of Ireland is the country's head of state. They represent the country abroad, take centre stage at major national events, and are responsible for ensuring that the constitution – the set of rules for government and politics - is followed.While the president's powers are limited, the office-holder's influence can be profound.Connolly will be inaugurated on 11 November with Higgins leaving office the day before.'Woman with a very independent mind'Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Micheál Martin said an \"outstanding honour\" had been bestowed upon Connolly.\"The people have spoken resoundingly and given Catherine a tremendous majority and a very clear mandate,\" he said.Tánaiste (Ireland's deputy prime minister) Simon Harris said: \"The great thing about this country is that we live in enduring democracy.\"We have an election, we go at it hammer and tongs and then we come together proudly behind the winner of the election.\"Earlier he acknowledged the high level of spoiled votes, saying he saw \"people going to quite a lot of effort to spoil their ballot\".Sinn Féin, the main opposition party in the Irish parliament, gave its support to Connolly after deciding not to run its own candidate.The party's president Mary Lou McDonald described the result as a \"stunning victory\" and said Connolly needed the support of her party in the presidential election campaign.Speaking at Dublin Castle on Saturday, Ms McDonald said: \"It is a victory for the combined opposition over the jaded worn-out politics of Fianna Fail and Fine Gael.\"Sinn Féin as the largest political party, of course it was a significant element of the campaign.\"And Catherine has asserted quite correctly that she is an independent candidate, a woman with a very independent mind.\"Connolly sought out to establish herself as a united Ireland candidate and said she would like to see a border poll on the island of Ireland during her presidency, which runs for seven years.In Northern Ireland, First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the win marked \"an era of hope\".\"This election has shown what can be achieved when parties committed to change and progress work together in common purpose,\" she said.\"That is the clear pathway to a better, united future.\"",

    "body": "Trump hopes China will help push Russia towards Ukraine peace talks7 hours agoTiffany WertheimerReutersTrump and Xi last met in person in 2019, during Trump's first term as presidentDonald Trump has said he would like China's help to deal with Russia as he seeks to bring an end to the war in Ukraine.\"I'd like China to help us out with Russia,\" the US president said on board Air Force One, as he flew to Asia for a whirlwind tour, where he will meet China's Xi Jinping in South Korea.It could be wishful thinking, however. China is Russia's biggest ally, and a vital support to Moscow since Western sanctions were imposed over its war in Ukraine.Trump's comments come off the back of a difficult week for Kyiv - the US refused to give it Tomahawk cruise missiles, EU leaders did not release frozen Russian cash to help fund its defence, and there have been more deadly strikes.Ending the Russia-Ukraine war has become a focal point for Trump in recent months, with a ceasefire deal so far eluding him, despite his campaign promises to solve the situation quickly. A summit with Putin in August failed to yield any tangible results, and Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Moscow.\"Every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere,\" Trump said earlier this week.On Wednesday, he announced new sanctions against Russia's two biggest oil companies - the first direct interventions the Trump administration has imposed on Russia over the war. What effect the blacklisting will have in the long-term is yet to be seen, but the Kremlin said it was \"immune\" to the sanctions.What's the significance of US sanctions on Russian oil?While Trump's meeting with Xi on Thursday is still expected to focus on the hostile trade relations between the US and China, Trump said that he would talk to Xi about \"everything\", including the war in Ukraine.\"I'd like to see China help us out [with Russia]. I have a very good relationship... with President Xi. Very good,\" he said, adding that Xi wants to see the war end.Earlier this week, Trump said that the Chinese president \"can have a big influence on Putin\".SPUTNIK/KREMLIN POOL/EPA/ShutterstockPutin, Xi and Kim showed their solidarity when the three met in Beijing last monthBeijing has never criticised Russia's war in Ukraine, and has been accused by the US and its allies of aiding Russia's war effort - which Beijing denies - through its purchases of Russian oil and monthly supply of dual-use materials (those with both commercial and military applications).Putin and Xi have previously touted their countries' relationship as a \"friendship with no limits\", and Russia hopes gas exports to China and other countries will replace the revenue lost after Western sanctions were imposed.Xi, Putin and Kim show united front at huge Chinese military paradeRussia's Putin hails 'unprecedented' ties with China at talks in BeijingThe warm relations between Russia and China were on full display last month, when Putin, Xi and North Korea's Kim Jong Un met in Beijing for an extraordinary show of solidarity and military might.EPA/ShutterstockRussian strikes on Kyiv left killed several people and caused huge damage on SaturdayAs Trump made his comments on Air Force One, emergency crews in Ukraine were at the scene of more Russian strikes, including some in Kyiv where several people were killed, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said.\"No country should be left alone in the face of such evil,\" he wrote on Telegram, reiterating the need for Ukraine's allies to step-up support.Meanwhile, in Russia's Belgorod region, residents living near a dam were told to evacuate after a Ukrainian strike on the local reservoir caused damage that could lead to flooding.More on this story",

    "body": "Venezuela's Maduro says US 'fabricating war' as it deploys world's largest warship7 hours agoKayla Epstein and Josh Cheetham,BBC VerifyThe USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, can carry up to 90 aircraftVenezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has accused the US of \"fabricating a new war\", after it ordered the world's largest warship to be sent to the Caribbean.The USS Gerald R Ford can carry up to 90 aircraft and its deployment marks a massive increase in US firepower in the region.The US has conducted 10 air strikes on vessels in the area as part of what it says is a war on drug traffickers. US President Donald Trump has accused Maduro of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organisation, which he denies, and there are fears in Venezuela that the US military build-up is aimed at removing the long-time opponent of Trump from power. The US is among many nations that do not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader, after the last election in 2024 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair. Opposition tallies from polling stations showed its candidate had won by a landslide.Venezuela plays a relatively minor role in the region's drug trade.What's Trump's endgame in Venezuela?The Pentagon said on Friday that the USS Gerald R Ford carrier would deploy to the US Southern Command area of responsibility, which includes Central America and South America, as well as the Caribbean. The additional forces \"will enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle transnational criminal organisations\", spokesman Sean Parnell said.Maduro accused the US of seeking \"a new eternal war\" in his address.\"They promised they would never again get involved in a war, and they are fabricating a war,\" he told state media.The carrier's deployment would provide the resources to start conducting strikes against targets on the ground. Trump has repeatedly raised the possibility of what he called \"land action\" in Venezuela, saying earlier this week that the US is \"looking at land now\" after getting \"the sea very well under control\".\"We stopped all drugs from coming in by sea. I will stop all drugs from coming in by land very shortly. You'll see that starting,\" he told reporters at the White House on Saturday before departing for a trip to Asia.The US has also bolstered its air presence in the region. BBC Verify has identified a number of US military aircraft across Puerto Rico.It comes as CNN reports Trump is considering targeting cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela, but is yet to make a final decision.Military analysts have pointed out that intercepting drugs at sea does not require a force as big as the current US one.Watch: The US is \"fabricating an eternal war\", says Nicolás MaduroOn Friday, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said \"six male narco-terrorists\" had been killed in an operation in the Caribbean.He said the boat had belonged to the Tren de Aragua - a transnational criminal organisation which has its base in Venezuela and has been proscribed as a terrorist group by the US State Department.The US air strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. \"This is about regime change. They're probably not going to invade, the hope is this is about signalling,\" Dr Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House think tank, told the BBC.He argued the military build-up was intended to \"strike fear\" into the hearts of the Venezuelan military and Maduro's inner circle so that they move against him.Pete Hegseth on XThe US said it had destroyed a drug trafficking boat earlier on FridayThe strike was the latest the Trump administration has carried out against alleged drug traffickers since early September. Most have taken place off the coast of South America, in the Caribbean, but on 21 and 22 October it carried out strikes in the Pacific Ocean as well.At least 43 people have been killed.Members of US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have raised concerns about the legality of the strikes and the president's authority to order them.On 10 September, 25 Democratic senators wrote to the White House, alleging the administration had struck a vessel days earlier \"without evidence that the individuals on the vessel and the vessel's cargo posed a threat to the United States\".Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican, has argued that such strikes require congressional approval. Trump has said he has the legal authority to order the strikes.\"We're allowed to do that, and if we do [it] by land, we may go back to Congress,\" Trump told White House reporters on Wednesday.Brian Finucane, a former US State Department lawyer, told the BBC that the situation amounted to a constitutional crisis that the US Congress, controlled by Republicans, has appeared unwilling to challenge. \"It is the US Congress that has principal control over the use of military force. That control has been usurped in this instance by the White House, and so it's up to Congress to push back,\" said Mr Finucane, who now works at the International Crisis Group.  ",

    "body": "22 hours agoWill GrantMexico, Central America and Cuba correspondentAn audacious attempted escape by one of the world's most wanted fugitives has been brought to an abrupt end, with the drug kingpin now facing charges in the US.In a late-night communique on Thursday, the Cuban Government said that it had extradited a Chinese citizen, Zhi Dong Zhang, to the authorities in Mexico. Hours later, Mexico's security chief then confirmed his subsequent extradition to the US on drug trafficking and money laundering charges.Known by various aliases including Brother Wang, Pancho and HeHe, Zhi Dong Zhang is accused by the US Justice Department of masterminding a vast international ring of fentanyl trafficking and money laundering covering numerous nations but particularly China, Mexico and the US.The list of charges against Mr Zhang is long, but in essence US prosecutors and the Mexican Attorney General's office accuse him of being a major player in the global drug trade. They say he has laundered millions of dollars in drug money for both the Sinaloa Cartel and the New Generation Jalisco Cartel (CJNG) as part of a worldwide drug distribution network.\"Brother Wang can be seen as a key link between Mexican cartels and Chinese chemical companies in sourcing the pre-cursor chemicals for fentanyl,\" former DEA agent Mike Vigil said, adding that he was also vital in converting drug funds into cryptocurrency.If convicted, Mr Zhang can expect to share a similar fate as other drug kingpins like Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman and Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada in a high-security facility in the United States.But how \"Brother Wang\" ended up in custody in Havana is an extraordinary tale involving fleeing house arrest in Mexico City, reportedly through a hole in a wall, taking a private jet to Cuba and an ultimately failed attempt to enter Russia.Mr Zhang was arrested in Mexico City in a joint security operation in October 2024. He was initially held in a maximum-security prison but was later granted house arrest by a judge – a decision that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum called \"outrageous\".Mr Zhang's escape had all the hallmarks of another embarrassing episode for Mexico: a man considered a vital cog in the machinery of drug smuggling, able to disappear from under the noses of the Mexican authorities tasked with guarding him. \"El Chapo\" Guzman managed that feat twice, much to Washington's frustration, before he was finally put on a plane in handcuffs to the US.That Mexican authorities were able to recover their prisoner and send him north came down to two things – an apparent stroke of luck in Russia and the strength of Mexico's security relationship with Havana.When Mr Zhang reached Cuba in July 2025, he set about making his next steps towards reaching a country with no extradition treaty with the US, officials say. There is a direct commercial flight to Moscow from Havana and Mr Zhang, they allege, was able to secure a seat on it using fake papers. However, the papers didn't get him past the immigration authorities in Russia. It has been reported that the Russians didn't fully appreciate who they had in their custody and, after he was briefly detained, they turned Mr Zhang around and sent him back to Cuba.On arriving back in Havana a second time, the Cuban security services were now aware of his real identity.Security analysts believe the authorities in Cuba held onto him for several months to interrogate him at length before sending him back to Mexico and, inevitably, onwards to the US. Mexico's Public Security Secretary, Omar Harfuch, was quick to thank Cuba for its co-operation – ultimately, for sparing Mexican blushes over another escaped high-profile prisoner.As always following the arrest of an alleged kingpin, the question becomes how far their removal will affect the global drug trade.Given Mr Zhang has spent the past year either in prison, under house arrest or on the run, the question may be moot, Mr Vigil said, as his absence has already largely been felt in Mexico's criminal underworld.\"It's really not going to have an impact as the cartels already have individuals working for them who can start to replace Brother Wang,\" said Mr Vigil. \"Even in the case of El Chapo Guzman, who was a much bigger figure, it had no impact on the global drug trade\", he argued.Over his first year in office, US President Donald Trump has pressured his Mexican counterpart to do more on the issue of fentanyl trafficking and Sheinbaum's administration has duly responded in kind. She has significantly increased seizures of the drug compared to her predecessor and her administration has sent dozens of convicted drug cartel members to the US to serve sentences there. They included several high-level drug names like Rafael Caro Quintero, wanted for the murder of a DEA agent in 1985.Her co-operation on the fentanyl issue, as well as on undocumented immigration, is considered the reason Trump has refrained from imposing the same level of trade tariffs on Mexico as he has on other commercial partners.Mr Zhang's extradition will bring genuine satisfaction in Washington at having taken a key figure in Mexican cartels' financial operations out of circulation. That, in turn, will please the Sheinbaum administration in Mexico and strengthen their claim to be in lockstep with their US counterparts on security.However, slowing or reducing the movement of pre-cursor chemicals for fentanyl from China to the Americas in any lasting way will take more than the extradition of one man.",

    "body": "8 hours agoLaura KuenssbergPresenter, Sunday with Laura KuenssbergKamala Harris says she still sees herself as having a political future and may run for the White House in 2028Former US Vice-President Kamala Harris has told the BBC she may run again for the White House.In her first UK interview, Harris said she would \"possibly\" be president one day and was confident there will be a woman in the White House in future.Making her strongest suggestion to date that she will make another presidential bid in 2028 after losing to Donald Trump last year, Harris dismissed polls that put her as an outsider to become the Democrats' pick for the next election.Speaking to Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Harris also turned her fire on her former rival, branding Trump a \"tyrant\", and said warnings she made about him on the campaign trail had been proved right.As the Democratic party searches for answers about Republican Donald Trump's decisive victory one year ago, much of the blame has been directed at former President Joe Biden for not standing down sooner.But there have also been questions raised about whether Harris could have run a better campaign and set out a clearer message on the number one issue, the economy.In the BBC interview Harris entertained the prospect of another run at the White House, saying her grandnieces would, \"in their lifetime, for sure\", see a female president. Asked if it would be her, she said, \"possibly\", confirming she is considering another run at the top job.Harris said she had not yet made a decision, but underlined that she still sees herself as having a future in politics.\"I am not done,\" the former vice-president said. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service and it's in my bones.\"Responding to odds that place her as an outsider to win a place on the Democratic ticket - even behind Hollywood actor Dwayne the Rock Johnson - she said she never listened to polls.\"If I listened to polls I would have not run for my first office, or my second office - and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here.\"Harris also said she believed predictions she made about Donald Trump behaving as a fascist and running an authoritarian government had come true.\"He said he would weaponise the Department of Justice - and he has done exactly that.\"She pointed to the suspension of late-night comic Jimmy Kimmel by ABC after he made a joke about Republican reaction to the death of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk.His removal from the airwaves, celebrated by Trump, came after the Trump-appointed regulator threatened Kimmel's broadcasters.\"You look at what has happened in terms of how he has weaponised, for example, federal agencies going around after political satirists… His skin is so thin he couldn't endure criticism from a joke, and attempted to shut down an entire media organisation in the process.\"Harris also slammed business leaders and institutions in America who have, in her view, too easily bowed to the president's demands.\"There are many… that have capitulated since day one, who are bending the knee at the foot of a tyrant, I believe for many reasons, including they want to be next to power, because they want to perhaps have a merger approved or avoid an investigation.\"The White House was dismissive when asked for a response to Harris's comments about the president.\"When Kamala Harris lost the election in a landslide, she should've taken the hint - the American people don't care about her absurd lies,\" said spokeswoman Abigail Jackson. \"Or maybe she did take the hint and that's why she's continuing to air her grievances to foreign publications.\"Harris has just published her account of her rollercoaster campaign, 107 Days, the time that was left to her to run for the presidency after Biden withdrew from the race following months of speculation about his mental acuity.In our full interview with the former vice-president, to be broadcast in the UK on Sunday at 09:00 GMT (05:00 EST), I pressed Harris several times on whether she ought to have urged Biden to make way for her sooner. How much did she really know about his health? And a question that may haunt her - whether she would be president now, not Donald Trump, if Biden had withdrawn earlier?The answer is plainly, unknowable - the great \"if\" that could have changed the fate of America. Among the Democratic soul-searching, Harris's candidacy is often disparaged, her weaknesses as a leader pinpointed as the reasons for her defeat, not just the last-minute nature of Biden's decision. When questioned about what went wrong, rather than plunge into deep analysis, her contention is because she started so late, it was almost impossible to win. Why Kamala Harris lost: A flawed candidate or doomed campaign?But having sat down with the Californian former prosecutor in the gilded surroundings of a luxury London hotel - rather than the increasingly golden surroundings of the Oval Office as Donald Trump glitzes up the decor - the possibility of power is something she is not willing to leave behind.Previous hints of her future presidential ambition seemed coy, non-committal - \"maybe, maybe not\", or \"I'm not focusing on that right now\". Her candour in our conversation was more striking. She was quick, eager even, to put herself in the frame for another tilt at power. But she stopped short of making any concrete commitment.That may be surprising given the thoroughly bruising nature of a defeat she has described as traumatising. She and her team were devastated by the defeat, which came as a surprise to them.\"My god, my god, what will happen to our country?\" Harris says she repeated when the result came through.Her attempt to explain it focuses on how narrow the gap in actual votes was between her and Trump. The popular vote was, indeed, very tight, with less than 2% in it. However, Harris was trounced by Trump in the all-important electoral college, where each state has a certain number of votes that tally up.What is the US electoral college, and how does it work?Harris was willing to drop heavy hints about her own future. But there's less willingness from her, or frankly any other senior Democrats, grappling with their party's long-term dilemmas. How does a centre-left party with mainstream leaders take on a right-wing populist leader? Is the answer to focus on Trump? Or is it to argue more forcefully for Main Street?  When I challenged the former vice-president on why her campaign did not better connect with working people, she said she needed more time to do that, and pointed to a longstanding drift away from her party among that group.She regrets she didn't have long enough in 2024 to make her own pitch on bread-and-butter issues like housing, or childcare. But if she had longer next time round, it's far from guaranteed her arguments would be more compelling, or more gladly received.Kamala Harris still travels with the trappings of an entourage. Aides anxiously watch the clock as her every minute is planned with military precision. Non-stop travel, choreographed events in different capitals, a tiny number of carefully planned TV interviews. This time, Harris is on the move for a book tour, not a presidential race. But maybe, if she has her way, this is the start of another campaign after all.Pictures: Jeff Overs/BBC",

    "body": "21 hours agoNardine Saadin Los AngelesJames Devaney via Getty ImagesBritney Spears stared at herself in a mirror, grinning as she grabbed an electric clipper. Chunks of her long, iconic locks fell to the floor of the Southern California salon. Paparazzi cameras outside documented every second of the now-infamous night in 2007, later following her with her new buzzcut to get a tattoo.The star said she did it because she felt cornered and humiliated by the paparazzi, who had chased her from the house of her estranged husband, Kevin Federline. In the midst of an acrimonious and widely publicised custody battle for their two young boys, the Princess of Pop said she acted out in defiance and wanted to give the press \"some material\". She called it an impulsive decision - one that to her, served as a public rebuke to a world she felt held her to untenable standards.To her, it was a \"desperate move by a desperate person\".But to her estranged husband, it was a wake-up call to \"just how far things had spiralled out of control\".Bauer-Griffin via Getty ImagesDecades later, those moments and the others that went on to define the pop star and her very public unravelling are back in the limelight - but what exactly happened and why depends on who is doing the retelling. After Spears shared her outlook in her 2023 memoir, The Woman In Me, Federline is now speaking out and sharing his take on their years together in a book released this week, titled You Thought You Knew. Like Spears, Federline's book details their intimate and chaotic relationship, the mental anguish they both suffered and provides an inside glimpse at the conservatorship battle that dictated much of Spears' life and career. It provides a side-by-side look, a he-said, she-said dissection of their lives. Jason Merritt via Getty ImagesThe Grammy Award winner, 43, has already denounced her ex's memoir, writing on social media that Federline's revelations have been \"extremely hurtful and exhausting\".But the dancer-turned-reality TV star says he's releasing You Thought You Knew after years of hesitation because he does not want his children growing up \"feeling like they have to explain who their father is\".Federline responds to the stories and accusations that Spears tells in her 2023 tome, in which she describes being financially and emotionally controlled by those closest to her. He contradicts her account at times, levying fresh accusations. Despite both memoirs offering vastly different accounts at times, both have a similar aim in reframing the public narrative thrust upon them by illuminating the episodes that led to Spears' conservatorship battle, as well as the nationwide movement that freed the pop star in 2021.Getty ImagesBritney Spears' father, left, was appointed by a court to be in charge of her finances and career Did the conservatorship help or hurt?In her book, Spears condemned the court-ordered conservatorship, also known as a guardianship, which she was under from 2008-2021. During that time, her father, Jamie Spears, was in control of her finances, career and many aspects of her personal life.She says that if she was just left to live her life, she would have worked it out.\"Thirteen years went by with me feeling like a shadow of myself. I think back now on my father and his associates having control over my body and my money for that long and it makes me feel sick,\" she wrote.But, she added, she resolved to go along with the protracted arrangement \"for the sake of my sons,\" even though \"being in it was really hard\".After the conservatorship ended, her father Jamie Spears said it had been \"necessary\" to protect her, but it was time for her to have control back.In his recounting, Federline has a different take. Even when the marriage tanked, it wasn't easy for him to \"watch her spiral\", he writes. Federline supported the arrangement, arguing that it provided \"some semblance of normalcy\" for their two boys together. After her psychiatric hold, Federline says he immediately filed for sole custody, but that set into motion a slew of issues that exacerbated Spears' relationship with their children.His ex, he writes \"saw the events in her life through a prism that painted her as the victim, the misunderstood one, the person wronged by everyone around her.\"But from where I stood, she needed help. Whether that was rehab or therapy, I couldn't say for sure,\" he writes, noting that she was in no state to manage her own affairs and needed some form of oversight or \"protective layer\".He adds that he came to find out that there was a lot he didn't know about the conservatorship, and he did not push for answers because part of him \"doesn't want to know\".Did the Free Britney movement get it 'wrong'?Spears has credited the viral Free Britney movement with helping her find the courage to challenge and eventually escape her conservatorship. \"The fact that my friends and my fans sensed what was happening and did all that for me, that's a debt I can never repay,\" she wrote, thanking them for standing up for her when she couldn't stand up for herself. But Federline says the movement \"got it wrong\" and those who are part of it now need to put the same effort into a \"Save Britney movement\". He shares ominous concerns about how the pop star is currently \"racing toward something irreversible\" and \"getting close to the 11th hour\".The pressure from the Free Britney movement, he alleges, led the judge on her conservatorship case \"to ignore the professional reports and cave to public opinion\".\"But none of that truly mattered in the end. If Britney believed she was being held against her will, and everything else she's shared since, then that trauma is real for her. And you can't ignore that,\" he says.Spears has continued to make headlines with strange and sometimes concerning posts on Instagram. Their boys are grown up but, according to Federline, they have haven't seen their mother much, and they don't really want to. Federline has four additional children, along with the two with Spears. Federline says he has lost faith that things will ever fully turn around for his ex-wife.\"I still hope that Britney can find peace. Whatever her future holds, I hope it's one where she can finally take control of her own life, on her own terms. This whole saga, twenty years of it, was built on denial. Britney never reached the first step of recovery: admitting there was a problem.\"AFPSpears has said she felt constantly cornered by paparazzi cameras that followed and dissected her lifeA ghost in their marriageSpears has laid blame on many people who were once close to her, including two of her exes, Federline and former NSYNC frontman Justin Timberlake.She accuses both of ruining her ability to \"trust people again\".In his own memoir, Federline says he was making a career for himself as a professional dancer who worked with Michael Jackson and NSYNC when he crossed paths with Spears. The couple had met before, when Federline was dancing on a tour for Spears' opening act.Federline, for his part, is self-aware, writing that he knows people viewed the Fresno, California, native as \"this dude jumped out of his trailer and into Britney's mansion\". But even the day before their wedding, there was a shadow over the relationship, he says.Federline contends in his book that when he and Spears got together in their early 20s, she had never really moved on from her ex-boyfriend Timberlake, detailing that they had a lot of \"unfinished business\" and that \"it lingered, like a ghost in the background of our relationship\". In her memoir, Spears recounted the pitfalls of her relationship with Timberlake, including him asking her to have an abortion and the public embarrassment that befell her after he accused her of cheating - further heightened when he cast a Spears lookalike in his music video for Cry Me a River.Frank Trapper via Getty ImagesBritney Spears and Justin Timberlake were the globe's most famous celebrity couple.Their relationship, which lasted from 1999 to 2002, has also been dissected over the years and has come with a public apology from Timberlake, after several documentaries about Spears recast her as a victim in her conservatorship.Federline says that \"there was always something there with Justin that she couldn't let go of\". He says Spears even called Timberlake the night before their wedding to get closure.\"Now, looking back... I realise it was deeper than that. She never really got over him,\" he writes.Re-igniting an old feud and an army of fans Federline's memoir has raised the ire of Spears, and her vocal army of online supporters. James Miller, an activist and Free Britney proponent, says the book will not help the singer.\"Britney does struggle with mental health problems, that's pretty obvious,\" he told the BBC. \"Exploiting her right now really isn't the best time. I don't think there's any alarm to sound.\"Michael Buckner via Getty ImagesFans protested outside the courthouse as Spears fought to be freed from her conservatorship From breaking out on The Mickey Mouse Club as a child star to dancing with a snake around her shoulders at the MTV Music Video Awards, Spears has lived her whole adult life in the spotlight.S Mark Young, a professor at the University of Southern California and author of The Mirror Effect: How Celebrity Narcissism is Seducing America, says Federline's book is unlikely to change people's minds about her.\"I think after this coming week, the book will die. Most people who follow Britney will not be moved,\" he says.Some have wondered why Federline, 47, has chosen to speak out now. \"No one heals when a book like this is written,\" Mr Young says.Mr Miller, and many online, have noted that now that their sons are both over 18, Federline would no longer be receiving a $40,000-per-month payment from the singer to support them.Federline denies having an ulterior motive beyond wanting to finally share his side of this infamous saga.Getty ImagesFederline says he worked hard to not just live off of Spears' money, such as DJing in Vegas in 2018In the memoir, Federline says the book was his best chance at sharing his side of the story.For decades, the media, Spears and her family have mostly told Federline's story, largely leaning into his \"bad boy\" persona and making him the butt of many late-night jokes.\"This is about finally telling my story,\" he writes in his book. \"My version. In my words. Because everybody else has done it for me. The media. The blogs. The exes. The strangers. The jokes. The headlines. They all had something to say about me. And I stayed quiet.\"He denies that he ever \"was just coasting off her money\" and insists he has always been \"out there hustling, grinding, investing - working to build a solid foundation for myself and my kids\".This opportunity was a way for him to finally share his side after decades of stories, gossip, rumours and accusations - which he says he avoided responding to in hopes of giving his family and children \"some kind of normal life\". \"But silence didn't bring peace,\" he writes. \"It left me choking on the words I never said.\"",

    "body": "Video has emerged appearing to show the alleged thieves behind the Louvre heist making their escape on a mechanical ladder in broad daylight.Two people can be seen looking around frantically as they slowly descend, minutes after the famed Paris museum was broken into and €88m-worth  (£77m)  of France's crown jewels were stolen.    The gang of four thieves have not been caught and on Wednesday, the Louvre's boss admitted that staff had failed to spot them early enough because there was only one camera pointing on the gallery where the items were displayed.In the video, the truck fitted with the ladder is seen parked by on a busy road running along the Seine as vehicles pass. Laurence des Cars told French lawmakers that the Louvre planned to double the number of CCTV cameras in and around the museum. She admitted that the camera trained on the Gallery of Apollo, the south-side room where the jewels were kept, was facing the wrong way.Paris city prosecutor Laure Beccuau told the Ouest France newspaper that up to 150 DNA samples and fingerprints had been retrieved so far as part of the police investigation.The theft happened in less than eight minutes, after the thieves arrived at 09:30 on Sunday (07:30 GMT) after the Louvre opened its doors to the public.They stole eight items including an emerald necklace and earrings given as a wedding gift by Napoleon Bonaparte to his second wife, Marie-LouiseAs they fled, they dropped a 19th-Century diamond-studded crown belonging to Empress Eugenie. Although it was recovered, the crown was damaged and des Cars said it had probably been crushed as the thieves prised it from its display case.",

    "body": "Donald Trump has said he would like to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his upcoming trip to Asia.\"I would. If you want to put out the word, I'm open to it,\" the US president told reporters onboard Air Force One as he departed for the region, adding that he \"had a great relationship\" with Kim. Trump made history during his first term, becoming the first sitting US president to set foot into North Korea when they last shook hands in 2019.His trip to Malaysia and Japan will see him meet a number of world leaders including China's Xi Jinping, amid trade negotiations sparked by Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs earlier this year.Trump has taken an atypical approach to North Korea - a secretive communist totalitarian state largely isolated on the world stage - and its attempts at creating nuclear weapons, initially taunting Kim as a \"little rocket man\".The pair met face-to-face three times during Trump's previous tenure in the White House but failed to agree a denuclearisation programme. North Korea has since conducted multiple tests of intercontinental missiles, its neighbours say.Asked if he would recognise North Korea as a nuclear state, Trump told reporters late on Thursday: \"I think they are sort of a nuclear power... They got a lot of nuclear weapons, I'll say that.\"Kim has said he was open to meeting Trump again, provided the US stopped pursuing its \"absurd\" demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. \"I still have a good memory of President Trump,\" Kim said in a speech last month, according to state media.Friends reunited? Trump faces a very different Kim Jong Un this timeSouth Korea's Unification Minister Chung Dong-young, who handles relations between the North and South, said there was a \"considerable\" chance the two leaders might meet while Trump is in South Korea for the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum, according to news agency AFP.A senior US official told reporters that a meeting was not in Trump's schedule, according to the Anadolu Agency - though their last meeting in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas came off the back of an invitation by Trump on social media.Trump's first stop will be in Malaysia, where he will attend Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit.He is expected to land in the South Korean city Busan on Wednesday ahead of the Apec summit. He will meet South Korean leader Lee Jae Myung, who discussed peace on the Korean peninsula and the possibility of a Trump-Kim meeting while visiting the White House in August.Lee told the BBC he was open to a deal between Trump and Kim in which North Korea agreed to freeze production of its nuclear weapons.Trump's meeting with China's President Xi comes on the backdrop of a trade war between the two nations.The two have agreed to hold off triple-digit tariffs threatened against one another while seeking a trade agreement - but that detente is in jeopardy after Trump said he would level a 100% trade levy on Chinese goods over Beijing's curbs on rare earth exports.The minerals are essential for many electronics and China is currently responsible for around 90% of exports of their refined form.",

    "body": "The US has placed sanctions on Colombia's President, Gustavo Petro, accusing him of failing to curb drug trafficking and allowing cartels to \"flourish\".The decision is the latest in a growing diplomatic dispute between the Latin American nation's first left-wing leader and his US counterpart Donald Trump.The two have clashed over US strikes on boats it says are being used to smuggle drugs, killing dozens including some Colombian nationals. Trump has said other nations had failed to stop the boats, while Petro has accused him of \"murder\".Colombia was once a close ally of Washington's war on drugs, receiving hundreds of millions of dollars annually in military assistance to counter drug gangs.The US also trains Colombian narcotics agents - something the Trump administration has said it will continue to support.But in its sanctions decision, it singled out Petro as having presided over a \"disastrous and ineffective\" drug policy that had led to a large increase in cocaine production.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that since Petro came to power, cocaine production in Colombia had \"exploded to the highest rate in decades, flooding the United States and poisoning Americans\".Sanctions have also been imposed on Colombia's Interior Minister Armando Benedetti, as well as Petro's wife and eldest son. All are barred from accessing assets and any properties they may have in the US. Petro responded that he had been fighting drug trafficking \"for decades\" and that his administration had stemmed the growth of coca crops.\"What the US Treasury is doing is an arbitrariness typical of an oppressive regime,\" he said.Cocaine production is currently at record-high levels in Colombia, according to researcher Héctor Galeano from the Colombia-based Institute of Advanced Social and Cultural Studies of Latin America and the Caribbean.The US Treasury said that cocaine from Colombia was often purchased by Mexican cartels, which then smuggle it into the US.  The US says it is removing Colombia's certification as an ally in the war on drugs, which grants it access to financial support. Colombia responded that it would cease buying weapons from the US.Petro has insisted that it was during the government of his predecessor, Iván Duque, that the area planted with coca had increased.He has also said that, in order for coca cultivation to decrease, what was needed was for demand for cocaine to go down in the US and in Europe.His primary attempts to curb drug-related criminality in Colombia have centred on facilitating peace negotiations between warring cartels that have for decades brought violence to the nation.His campaign promise of bringing \"total peace\" to Colombia appears to be collapsing, with mounting attacks and stalled negotiations.Petro told BBC News in September air strikes on alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean were an \"act of tyranny\".He used a speech at the UN in New York around the same time to argue the attacks were not about controlling the drug trade but serving a need to use \"violence to dominate Colombia and Latin America\".Imposing sanctions on a head of state is rare but not unprecedented. The leaders of countries including Russia, North Korea and Venezuela have previously been sanctioned.",

    "body": "A woman who raped and murdered 12 year-old Lola Daviet in Paris has been handed a rare whole-life sentence in a case that has shocked France. Dahbia Benkired, aged 27, must spend at least 30 years in prison after a panel of judges and a jury decided to impose the country's harshest possible penalty.A whole-life term is extremely rare in France and Benkired is the first woman to receive it.Those who have been given the sentence include serial killer and rapist Michel Fourniret and jihadist Salah Abdeslam, who took part in the 2015 Paris attacks which killed 130 people.Following the verdict, Lola's mother Delphine Daviet said: \"We believed in justice and we got it.\" Her brother Thibault, added: \"We have restored the memory of my sister, we have restored the truth.\"Warning: This story contains distressing detailsLola was murdered in October 2022. Her body was discovered in a plastic storage box in the courtyard of the building where she lived in north-eastern Paris. Benkired is an Algerian immigrant who was under orders to leave the country. French right-wing and far-right politicians have seized on the case.The prosecutor in the trial had argued for Benkired to receive the longest sentence possible. Benkired was examined by psychiatric experts and found to have \"psychopathic\" traits but otherwise sane.The prosecutor told a panel of three judges and six jurors: \"Make no mistake no drug treatment can fundamentally transform Ms Benkired's personality. When there is no illness, there is no treatment.\"Before jurors began their deliberations on Friday, Benkired told the court: \"I ask for forgiveness and what I did is horrible.\"That's all I have to say.\"CCTV footage from the afternoon of 14 October, 2022 showed Benkired, then 24 years-old, approaching Lola after she returned home from school.According to reports, Benkired lured Lola into an apartment her older sister was sub-letting in the building.   Over an hour-and-a-half, Benkired subjected the 12-year-old to a sexual assault before attacking her with scissors and a box cutter.Benkired bound Lola with duct tape, including around her head, leading to her death by asphyxiation.As he read out the verdict, the presiding judge referred to the \"extreme cruelty of the criminal acts\" which he described as \"true torture\".\"In determining the appropriate sentence, the court took into account the unspeakable psychological damage to the victim and her family in such violent and almost unspeakable circumstances,\" he said.Benkired was in France on a student visa but had failed to renew it. In July 2022, she was stopped at an airport in Paris and was given 30 days to leave the country. Days after Lola's murder in October that year, Jordan Bardella, president of France's far-right National Rally party wrote on X that the woman \"had no business being in France\". Hard-right rival Éric Zemmour also took to social media to write: \"Lola's murderer should never have crossed her path.\"France's Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin criticised the \"indecency\" of politicians who, he said, \"should reflect on the consequences of their words\". Lola's mother and her father, Johan Daviet, denounced \"any use of the name and image of [our] child for political ends\".Mr Daviet died in 2024, aged 49.",

    "body": "Former Madagascan President Andry Rajoelina, who was ousted in a coup last week, has been stripped of his citizenship by the new regime.The order, signed by new Prime Minister Herintsalama Rajaonarivelo, cited local laws stipulating that people who acquired foreign citizenship should lose their Malagasy nationality.Rajoelina, 51, obtained French citizenship a decade ago, prompting calls for his disqualification from the 2023 presidential election. But he defied those calls and went on to win.He fled the African island nation after weeks of protests over persistent power and water shortages, culminating in a military takeover led by Col Michael Randrianirina.Rajoelina has said he has gone into hiding for his own safety, and his whereabouts remain unclear.When he disclosed his French nationality months before Madagascar's last presidential election, he argued he had only secretly acquired it to make things easier for his children studying in France.In recent weeks, he had faced demonstrations initially organised by youth movement Gen Z Mada and inspired by similar anti-government protests in Nepal, which were only exacerbated when his government responded with violence.Rajoelina sacked his energy minister and then his government - but this did little to quell the calls for him to step down.Protesters had hoped that Rajoelina would resign to pave the way for a smooth, democratic transition.Instead, he clung to power, eventually leading to Madagascar's elite military unit, of which Randrianirina was chief, to seize power.He has now been sworn in and has formed a new government, pledging to hold elections within two years.",

    "body": "12 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentGetty ImagesCynthia Erivo, Sabrina Carpenter and Lady Gaga all have multiple Grammy nominations this yearAt the ripe old age of 67, the Grammy Awards are still considered \"music's biggest night\". This year's ceremony takes place in LA on Sunday, with everyone from Harry Styles to Chaka Khan due to attend.Kendrick Lamar tops the nominations with nine nods, most of them for his sixth album, GNX. He was the main winner at last year's ceremony, too, winning both record and song of the year for his scorching diss track, Not Like Us.Other contenders include Lady Gaga, with seven nominations, along with Bad Bunny, Sabrina Carpenter and Leon Thomas, who have six each.In total, there are 95 awards, distributed over a mind-boggling eight hours. Alongside banner categories like album of the year, we'll find out who had the best album artwork, and who's made the best \"ambient, new age or chant\" album.Here's everything you need to know ahead of the ceremony.1) Who's going to win album of the year?Getty ImagesBad Bunny could be the first person to win the night's main prize with an album sung entirely in SpanishMost insiders agree that there's a three-way race for the night's biggest prize - with Bad Bunny, Kendrick Lamar and Lady Gaga the presumed favourites.None of them have ever won before, despite multiple nominations, and there are good reasons to think they're the front-runners.Gaga is a Grammy darling, with 14 wins from 45 nominations. Her seventh album, Mayhem, is a triumphant return to the maximalist pop that made her famous, delivered with the hard-won grace of someone who's endured 18 years in the pop machine. Like Beyoncé last year, voters might feel she's put in the work to earn the top title.Lamar is in a similar position. He's the only artist with album of the year nominations for five consecutive releases, and GNX is a snappy, crowd-pleasing tour de force.Giving him the prize would also go some way to correcting the Grammys' rap problem. The last time a hip-hop album won album of the year was in 2004.But Bad Bunny is the presumptive front-runner. The Puerto Rican star's musically ambitious Debí Tirar Más Fotos, fuses live instrumentation with the hip-swaying pulse of reggaeton, plena, salsa and a multitude of other Latin styles.A win for Bad Bunny would mark the first win for a Spanish language album.That said, the Grammys have a habit of making spectacularly weird decisions, so don't discount the chances of Justin Bieber or Sabrina Carpenter lifting the trophy.Notably, no matter who wins album of the year, it will be their first victory in the category.2) Will there be justice for Milli Vanilli?!Getty ImagesRob Pilatus (left) and Fab Morvan won best new artist in 1990 - but they didn't get to keep the trophies for longPop duo Milli Vanilli were stripped of their Grammy Award for best new artist in 1990, when it was discovered that the members, Fab Morvan and Rob Pilatus, had been miming to someone else's vocals.Thirty-six years later, Morvan is nominated for best audiobook for his memoir You Know It's True: The Real Story of Milli Vanilli.It's an eye-opening and harrowing story that lays bare what fame demands of you, and how Morvan struggled to rebuild his life after becoming one of music's biggest punchlines.If he wins, it could be an emotional moment of redemption.3) Can Olivia Dean win best new artist?Olivia Dean was one of the biggest break-out stars of last yearThe British star is certainly a front-runner. Her joyful, old-school pop songs were deservedly massive last year, pairing classic songcraft with an unabashedly romantic outlook.Her album, The Art Of Loving, had a golden streak in December, just as voters were filling in their ballots, boosting her odds of victory.It came out too late to be shortlisted for album of the year, though. She'll have to wait 12 months for that one.Dean faces strong competition from fellow Brit Lola Young, whose cathartically confrontational single Messy was a breakout hit last year.R&B artist Leon Thomas could also sneak off with the trophy. A former writer for Ariana Grande, SZA and Post Malone, he's the only best new artist nominee to pick up an album of the year nod, which suggests he's popular with voters.The rest of the pack includes influencer-turned-pop star Addison Rae, influencer-turned-pop star Alex Warren, frenetic girl group Katseye, chiselled rock star Sombr and LA indie outfit The Marías.For the second year in a row, all eight new artist nominees will perform during a special segment on Sunday night.4) What about the other big prizes?Getty ImagesAfter performing at last year's Super Bowl, Kendrick Lamar and SZA are hot favourites to win record of the year for their loved-up duet, LutherOne of the year's most fiercely-contested categories is record of the year - better understood as \"best single\".That's where you'll find Sabrina Carpenter's Manchild butting heads with Lady Gaga's Abracadabra and Chappell Roan's The Subway.But none of them really captured the public imagination in the same way as Rosé and Bruno Mars's APT. A honking great crossover hit, it has exactly the sort of cross-generational appeal the Grammys loves.The only serious competition is Kendrick and SZA's Luther, a sumptuous rap ballad that spent 13 weeks at number one in America last year.If APT wins, it'll be a record-breaker twice over. Rosé will become the first K-pop artist to win a Grammy; and Mars will become the only artist to win record of the year four times. (Right now, he's tied with Paul Simon on three.)The song of the year award - which recognises the songwriters - has almost exactly the same shortlist, with the addition of Golden, from the movie K-Pop Demon Hunters.The prominent use of samples and interpolations in Luther and APT could put them at a disadvantage here; which is good news for Carpenter's Manchild - whose country-pop hybrid appeals to a broad cross-section of voters.Bad Bunny could also win here for DTMF (I should have taken more photos), a gorgeous rumination on the passage of time that segues into a lively celebration of life.5) Is there a list of Grammy performers?Getty ImagesJustin Bieber will take to the stage ahead of his headline slot at this year's Coachella Music FestivalHeck, yeah. And what a list...Justin BieberSabrina CarpenterClipse & Pharrell WilliamsOlivia DeanKatseyeLady GagaLauryn Hill (Tribute to D'Angelo & Roberta Flack)Reba McIntyre with Brandy Clark and Luka NelsonThe MaríasBruno MarsPost Malone, Slash, Chad Smith (Tribute to Ozzy Osbourne)Addison RaeRoséSombrTyler, The CreatorLeon ThomasAlex WarrenLola Young6) Will Taylor Swift be performing?ReutersTaylor Swift's Life Of A Showgirl album was released after the eligibility period for this year's Grammy AwardsNot on your nelly.Rumours that Taylor Swift would turn up and tinkle the ivories were shot down by Grammy producer Ben Winston.Asked about the speculation by the showbiz website Hits Daily Double, he pointed out that the source of the story was... er, the showbiz website Hits Daily Double.\"The only reason people think Taylor might be performing or coming is because Hits decided to print it this week and it was picked up globally,\" he said.\"But Hits just totally made that up. And now I am getting asked about it by you, as if it's a real thing, when it was made up in your office!\"Also not performing: Bad Bunny. His gig headlining the Super Bowl half time show next month means he's unable to take the stage at the Grammys.7) Is it finally time for a K-pop Grammy?Getty ImagesRosé could be the first K-Pop star to win a Grammy on SundayRight now, no K-pop artist has ever won a Grammy - although BTS have received multiple nominations and even performed at the ceremony.That could change on Sunday. Rosé, one quarter of the South Korean girl group Blackpink, is nominated for three awards for APT, her irresistible, cheerleader chanting duet with Bruno Mars. In the song of the year, she goes head-to-head with the fictional girl group Huntr/x, who appear in the hit animation K-Pop Demon Hunters.And Katseye, a global girl group trained under the arduous K-pop system, are also up for best group and best pop group performance, for their single Gabriela.They might not win, but there's a growing recognition that K-pop has become a cultural and commercial force. For Audrey Nuna, one of the singers behind Huntr/x, getting to perform at the show represents a huge step forward.\"You're going to see three Korean faces,\" she told E! News. \"To think about the kids who are going to see that, and hopefully for that to shape their understanding of what they can do in this world, is the stuff that is giving me chills up my spine.\"In an interview earlier this week, the Recording Academy CEO, Harvey Mason Jr, confirmed there was a \"groundswell\" amongst voters for a separate K-pop category. Could it be created just in time for BTS's comeback? Watch this space.8) Any other notable nominees and surprises?EPAThe Dalai Lama is up for his first ever GrammyBarbra Streisand could correct a historic wrong on Sunday night. Her duets album, The Secret of Life, is nominated for best traditional pop album - a category she has lost 13 times since it was introduced in 1992.Her chances look slim, though, with stronger albums by Lady Gaga, Elton John & Brandi Carlile, and Icelandic jazz singer Laufey all in the running.Festival headliners and generally excellent people Haim could become the first ever all-female band to win best rock album.\"We really set out to make a rock album this time, so it's a huge milestone,\" Alana Haim told the BBC after their nomination. \"But we're just grateful for the women that came before us.\"Elsewhere, the Dalai Lama is nominated for best audio book, for Meditations: The Reflections Of His Holiness The Dalai Lama. It's the first time a Dalai Lama has received a Grammy nomination.And we could end the night with the youngest-ever Grammy winner. Eight year old Aura V is nominated for best children's album for Harmony, a bubbly, life-affirming record she made with her dad, Harold Simmons II. 9) Will artists address the political situation in the US?ReutersBillie Eilish has been a vocal critic of the actions of Immigration enforcement officers in the USIn the week that Bruce Springsteen released a song denouncing \"King Trump\" and \"federal thugs\" in Minneapolis, it seems impossible that politics won't feature on the Grammys stage.Billie Eilish, nominated for record and song of the year, has called on her fellow musicians to \"speak up\" about the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, whose actions have resulted in the death of two protestors. Bad Bunny didn't need prompting. He previously called ICE agents \"sons of bitches\" who won't leave \"people alone and working\". President Trump has defended the immigration operation in Minnesota, saying it took \"thousands of hardened criminals\" out of the state. On Wednesday, however, he said his administration would \"de-escalate a little bit\", amid rising tensions.Grammys boss Harvey Mason Jr said it was inevitable that emotions would spill onto the stage this Sunday.\"You're going to hear and feel what's going on in the world through the music,\" he  told CNN. \"Maybe some people will choose to speak out about it, but you're definitely going to feel it in the music, in the performance, in the passion that goes into the art.\"10) Who votes for the Grammys?Getty ImagesWinners all receive a golden gramophone trophyThis year, about 15,000 people were eligible to vote for the Grammys - including musicians, producers, lyricists, and even the people who write album liner notes.To qualify, they must be currently working in the music industry, and pay an annual subscription of $150 (£120) to the Recording Academy. All former winners are also eligible to vote.Every member is allowed to vote in up to 10 categories across three fields, such as rock, classical and R&B. They are encouraged only to vote in genres where their expertise lies.Additionally, every member, regardless of their background, gets to vote for the six biggest awards of the night. Those are: Album of the year, record of the year, song of the year, best new artist, songwriter of the year and producer of the year.The 2026 awards recognise music released between 31 August, 2024 and 30 August, 2025. More than 20,000 records were submitted for consideration this year. The winners will not be revealed until the ceremony.11) How can I watch in the UK?Getty ImagesComedian Trevor Noah is hosting the ceremony for the sixth and final timeThe ceremony is split into two parts, with the first 80 awards distributed during what's called the \"premiere ceremony\" at 12:30 in Los Angeles / 20:30 in London on Sunday.It's often worth tuning in. The winners in the more obscure categories are less polished and more excited about winning, and the performances are looser and, dare I say it, more musical than the grandiose set pieces you'll see later.It's also the place to see British stars like Wet Leg, Yungblud, FKA Twigs and Sleep Token find out whether they've won in the rock and dance categories.That's also where you want to go to watch red carpet coverage, which kicks off at 15:00 in Los Angeles / 23:00 in the UK.Finally, the main show kicks off at 17:00 Los Angeles / 01:00 Monday in the UK. It's broadcast live in the US on CBS and streaming platform Paramount Plus. At present, there is no way to watch in the UK without circumventing geographical streaming restrictions, but clips from the ceremony appear on social media with incredible speed.Full speeches and select performances are usually uploaded to YouTube the following day.",

    "body": "6 hours agoGeorge WrightAFP via Getty ImagesMany are still being treated in hospital for severe burns sustained in the fire at Le Constellation barA teenager who was injured when a deadly bar fire broke out in a Swiss ski resort on New Year's Eve has died in hospital, taking the death toll to 41, the local public prosecutor announced.\"An 18-year-old Swiss national died at a hospital in Zurich on January 31,\" the Wallis canton's public prosecutor, Beatrice Pilloud, said in a statement.No further information would be released at this stage, she added.The fire at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana - a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16 - also injured 116 people.Most of the victims of the fire were young - eight were under the age of 16 - and many are still being treated in hospital for severe burns.Switzerland's Federal Office for Civil Protection told the AFP news agency on Friday that, as of Monday, 44 patients were being treated abroad. They included 18 in France, 12 in Italy, eight in Germany and six in Belgium.The Wallis health ministry told the news agency that 37 patients were still in Swiss hospitals as of Monday.Initial findings from an investigation suggest the fire began as sparklers attached to champagne bottles ignited soundproof foam that lined the ceiling of the bar's basement.Authorities have acknowledged that the bar had not undergone safety checks for five years.The owners of the bar, Jacques and Jessica Moretti, have been accused by authorities of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.Criminal proceedings have also been brought against the municipality's head of public safety and a former council fire safety inspector.A Swiss court has imposed a travel ban on Jessica Moretti as an alternative to pre-trial detention. She has had to surrender her passport and must report to police every day.She previously told reporters that she was sorry about the \"unthinkable tragedy\".Jacques Moretti is being held in custody for an initial period of 90 days.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBarbara Plett Usher,in Doha, Qatar,andJack BurgessEPAIran is due to hold live fire naval drills in the Strait of HormuzIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that any attack on his country would spark a regional conflict, as the US continues to build up its forces nearby.\"The Americans should know that if they start a war, this time it will be a regional war,\" Khamenei was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency.Donald Trump earlier said Iran was in \"serious discussions\" and he hoped they would lead to something \"acceptable\", while Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told CNN he was \"confident that we can achieve a deal\" on Tehran's nuclear programme.Araghchi said: \"Unfortunately, we have lost our trust [in] the US as a negotiating partner,\" but added the exchange of messages through friendly countries in the region was facilitating \"fruitful\" talks with Washington.Iran's top security official Ali Larijani had previously said a framework for negotiations was progressing.As part of its build up of forces, the US has sent its aircraft carrier the USS Abraham Lincoln to the region and late last week US Central Command said it was operating in the Arabian Sea.\"[Trump] regularly says that he brought ships... The Iranian nation shall not be scared by these things,\" added Khamenei.Iran had been expected to begin a two-day live-fire naval exercise on Sunday in the Strait of Hormuz - one of the world's most important shipping lanes and a key route for energy supplies. However on Sunday Reuters quoted an Iranian official as saying the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) navy had no plans for such an exercise.Around a fifth of the world's traded oil passes through the waterway, which is about 33km (21 miles) wide at its narrowest point between Iran and Oman. Iran has in the past threatened to close the strait if it were attacked. The US has warned Iran against any \"unsafe and unprofessional behaviour\" near its forces in the area.Araghchi responded by saying: \"The US military is now attempting to dictate how our Powerful Armed Forces should conduct target practice in their own turf.\"On Saturday, two explosions in Iran heightened anxiety in the country. Local authorities said a blast that killed one and hurt 14 at a building in the southern port city of Bandar Abbas was caused by a gas leak. Tasnim denied social media reports that a Revolutionary Guards Corps navy commander had been targeted in the blast.In the south-western city of Ahvaz, at least four people were killed in another explosion, with local authorities again blaming a gas leak, according to Iran's Tehran Times.On Thursday, Trump said he had told Iran that it had to do two things to avoid US military action: \"Number one, no nuclear. And number two, stop killing protesters.\"The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says it has confirmed the killing of more than 6,300 people since the unrest began in late December, and is investigating another 17,000 reported deaths.Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned the final toll could exceed 25,000.In his remarks on Sunday, Khamenei accused protesters of attacking police, the IRGC and other facilities including banks and mosques.\"The coup was suppressed,\" Tasnim quoted him as saying.",

    "body": "18 minutes agoMaia DaviesState Emergency Service of UkraineMajor energy provider DTEK said the vehicle was carrying its mine workersTwelve miners have been killed by a Russian drone strike in eastern Ukraine, the country's largest private energy firm has said.DTEK said a bus carrying workers after a shift in the Dnipropetrovsk region had been targeted in Sunday's attack. At least seven people were injured.Earlier, at least two others were killed and nine injured in separate Russian attacks overnight and on Sunday. The victims included six people hurt when a drone hit a maternity hospital in Zaporizhzhia. Two were women giving birth at the time of the strike.In a post on Telegram, Zaporizhzhia regional head Ivan Fedorov called it further \"proof of a war directed against life\".BBC Verify confirmed the site was Maternity Hospital No.3 on Bocharova Street in the east of the city.Footage shared across social media carried the watermarks of national and local administrations and showed offices, rooms with beds for patients, and a children's room with the windows broken and covered in debris. Some footage showed degrees of fire damage, while two videos showed a fire still burning on the first storey. Another showed fire fighters breaking down interior doors and ferrying patients away.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said the hospital attack showed Russian President Vladimir Putin was pursuing a \"war against civilians contrary to peace efforts\".Fedorov later reported three people had been injured by a separate strike in a residential area.After the strike on the DTEK bus in the city of Terenivka, the company said 15 miners had been killed. It later revised the death toll down to at least 12.Elsewhere, a man and a woman were killed by a drone strike in the central city of Dnipro, Ganzha said.Moscow launched a wave of targeted attacks on Ukraine's power grid in January, affecting heating and electricity supplies during an extraordinarily cold winter - with temperatures forecast to plunge below -20C in places this weekend.US President Donald Trump had said on Thursday that Putin had agreed to halt attacks because of the cold - the Kremlin later said the pause would expire on Sunday.Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said a second round of three-way talks to end the fighting after nearly four years would begin on Wednesday, rather than Sunday as had been planned.He did not give a reason for the delay, and said the talks between Russian, Ukrainian and US officials would take place in Abu Dhabi.Additional reporting by Richard Irvine-Brown, BBC Verify",

    "body": "5 hours agoJohanna ChisholmBBC NewsBBCJeffrey Epstein made $75,000 (£55,000) of payments to accounts connected to Lord Mandelson, bank statements released by the US Department of Justice suggest.Between 2003 and 2004, Epstein appears to have sent three separate $25,000 payments referencing Lord Mandelson.Lord Mandelson said he had no record or recollection of receiving the sums and did not know whether the documents were authentic.He reiterated his regret for \"ever having known Epstein\" and for continuing his association following the disgraced financier's conviction, apologising \"unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered\".Images of the former UK ambassador to the US in his underwear have also been uncovered in the latest tranche of Epstein files. In a redacted picture, he is seen standing next to a female, whose face is not visible.He has said he \"cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were\".It is not known when or where the images of Lord Mandelson and the female were taken. Being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing.US Department of JusticeLord Mandelson is seen here in a picture from the Epstein files.The recently released bank statements, first reported by the Financial Times, appear to show three separate payments referencing Lord Mandelson, who was Labour MP for Hartlepool at the time, being sent from Epstein's JP Morgan bank accounts.The first, dated 14 May 2003, shows a payment was sent to a Barclays bank account where Reinaldo Avila da Silva - Lord Mandelson's partner at the time - is named as \"A/C\", typically an abbreviation for account. In that payment, a \"Peter Mandelson\" is named on the account as \"BEN\", which is often an abbreviation for beneficiary. The second and third payments of $25,000 were made to HSBC accounts only days apart in June 2004. In both, \"Peter Mandelson\" is the only person named, again as \"BEN\".  It is unclear if the three payments ever made it into any of the named accounts. Asked for a response to da Silva's loan, Lord Mandelson said he had been \"very clear\" about his relationship with Epstein in interviews with the BBC.\"I have nothing more to add,\" he said.Lord Mandelson was later sent to Washington by Sir Keir Starmer in December 2024 as the UK's ambassador to the US, but was sacked the following September after further revelations emerged about his friendship with Epstein. Emails revealed he had been in contact with Epstein after the US financier's 2008 conviction, sending a string of supportive messages.On Sunday, Housing Secretary Steve Reed confirmed the government was not aware of Mandelson's alleged financial links to Epstein, after being asked about it by Laura Kuenssberg.\"You're talking about things that happened more than 20 years ago,\" he said, stressing \"there was no knowledge\" about what was going on at that time.Reed added that the reason Mandelson was removed as US ambassador was because \"there were things he had not disclosed\" to government.\"I think he should answer questions about his own life, not me.\"On 11 January, he told Laura Kuenssberg that his relationship with Epstein was a \"terrible mistake\". Days later, he offered a more direct apology to the victims of the disgraced financier, telling Newsnight he was \"wrong\" to continue associating with Epstein. Epstein's 2008 conviction was part of a plea bargain he reached in Florida. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison after pleading guilty to two charges, including soliciting girls as young as 14 for prostitution.Among the many emails exchanged between Epstein and Mandelson, one shows Epstein appearing to suggest to Mandelson that he could remove his peerage if he married Princess Beatrice. In October 2009, Epstein wrote: \"or you can marry princess beatrice, the queen would have a queen as a grandson.\"The earlier correspondence in this chain is not included, but Mandelson replied to Epstein's message by saying: \"Remember, I am already her Lord President.\"Epstein explained in separate email correspondence with a friend that he gave this advice to Mandelson so that he could run for prime minister, which he was unable to do as a member of the House of Lords.",

    "body": "1 hour agoGeorge WrightHengaw Organization for Human RightsErfan Soltani was arrested on 10 January in the city of FardisA 26-year-old Iranian man who was reportedly sentenced to death in connection with anti-government protests last month has been released on bail, reports say.Erfan Soltani was arrested on 8 January in the city of Fardis, just west of Tehran, as protests swept across the country, prompting a deadly crackdown by Iranian authorities.Officials then informed his family that he had been scheduled to be executed within days, without giving any additional details, according to Norway-based Kurdish human rights group Hengaw.But Iran's judiciary denied that he was sentenced to death, saying he faced security-related charges carrying prison terms only.Soltani's lawyer, Amir Mousakhani, told the AFP news agency that he was released on bail on Saturday \"and received all of his belongings including his cellphone\".A bail of \"two billion tomans\" (around $12,600; £9,200)  was paid for his release, the lawyer added.Hengaw and Iranian media, including Isna, a semi-official Iranian news agency, also said Soltani had been bailed.The arrest of Soltani, a clothes shop owner, made headlines around the world when it was reported that he was allegedly due to be executed.At the time, one of Soltani's relatives told BBC Persian that a court had issued a death sentence \"in an extremely rapid process, within just two days\".In January, the Iranian government called reports by foreign media organisations that Soltani faced execution a \"blatant act of news fabrication\".Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi also said in an interview with US television that there was \"no plan\" to hang people.Following the initial reports, Hengaw later said that, according to information obtained through relatives, Soltani's execution was postponed.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says it has confirmed the killing of more than 6,300 people since the unrest began in late December, and is investigating another 17,000 reported deaths.Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned the final toll could exceed 25,000.In remarks on Sunday, Khamenei accused protesters of attacking police, the IRGC and other facilities including banks and mosques.",

    "body": "1 day agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporter, Calgary, AlbertaReutersPierre Poilievre spoke to a full room of Conservative supporters in Calgary on Friday, where he pitched himself to stay on as leaderPierre Poilievre has cemented his position as Canada's Conservative Party leader, having received a strong endorsement from members despite presiding over recent electoral defeats.He secured 87.4% of votes in the leadership review, held on Friday in Calgary among delegates instead of the wider membership, after delivering a speech calling for Canadians to stay united in the face of an \"uncertain world\" and amid growing separatist sentiments in Alberta and Quebec. \"A house divided cannot stand,\" Poilievre said.A leadership review is automatically triggered after an election loss - in this case Poilievre's defeat to Mark Carney's Liberals last April, in which he also lost his own seat. Despite the political setbacks, delegates who spoke to the BBC said that they still had confidence in Poilievre to lead them into the next election.\"As far as the party is concerned, I think we're in the right direction,\" said Thomas Bambrick, a delegate from Winnipeg, adding that the vote result equals to a \"resounding yes\" for trust in the Conservative leader. Ahead of the vote, Poilievre delivered a nearly hour-long speech that doubled as a pitch to Conservative voters at the party's convention in Calgary, Alberta, where he outlined his vision for Canada's future should his party form the next government. Canada's conservative leader faces leadership testWho is Pierre Poilievre?He focused much of his messaging on affordability and crime - issues that have long resonated with his base - and promised a small government that would represent \"people who have felt unseen for too long\". Poilievre also touched on geopolitical tensions facing Canada, including its strained relationship with the US, arguing that the same domestic policies he was pitching will also help Canada \"stand on its own two feet\". His speech was made on a backdrop of a growing grassroots separatist movement in the Conservative stronghold of Alberta, where a process of collecting signatures to trigger an independence referendum is under way. In Quebec, the sovereignist Parti Québécois is also polling ahead, promising its own independence referendum in the province should it be elected to the provincial government later this year. Poilievre addressed these threats to Canadian unity in his speech, blaming the Liberal Party for people losing \"hope in the confederation\". Party members who spoke to the BBC said the speech was well received, praising it for sticking to traditional Conservative messaging while also confronting separatism - what one member called \"the elephant in the room\".Ballots in Friday's vote were cast in person by delegates who were selected to represent Conservative voters in each constituency across Canada.Poilievre has remained popular with his party despite the Conservative's unexpected loss last year, as well as the loss of the seat he had held for more than 20 years.In recent months, two elected Conservative MPs have left the party to join the Liberals, who under Carney have adopted more centrist policies, raising questions about the party's unity and Poilievre's leadership. But supporters of Poilievre credit him with delivering historic gains for the party, which received a record 41% of the popular vote last year. In particular, the Conservative leader has been successful in courting young voters through his messaging on affordability issues like the cost of living and housing. He has struggled, however, with defining his party's stance on US President Donald Trump, whom many Canadians have come to view as an existential threat due to his tariffs on Canadian goods and his rhetoric around it becoming the 51st US state.Poilievre has also struggled with his likeability, with surveys showing that more than half of Canadians hold a negative view of him. Many cite his tone, which they view as overly combative. Polls indicate his party is still trailing, with a Léger poll released this week showing the Conservatives nine points behind the Liberals.Poilievre addressed some of the shortcomings in his speech on Friday, telling party members that a lesson he learned is to not waver on his messaging. \"You told us to ignore the voices who keep telling us to abandon our conservative principles,\" he said as the audience applauded. \"We will stay true to our principles.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinX / Congresswoman Ilan OmarFive-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias are back in MinnesotaA five-year-old boy and his father who were detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minnesota have returned home, a congressman has said.Texas Congressman Joaquin Castro, a Democrat, announced on Sunday that Liam Conejo Ramos and his father Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias were released from Dilley detention center in Texas and had travelled back to Minneapolis.  Castro said: \"Liam is now home. With his hat and his backpack.\"The detainment of the pair sparked protests outside the detention facility where they were being held, and led to a national outcry. In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said: \"ICE did NOT target or arrest a child.\"Their return home came after US District Judge Fred Biery granted an emergency request from the family's lawyer, and ordered their release on Saturday. The judge condemned their detention as driven by a \"perfidious lust for unbridled power\".\"The case has its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatising children,\" Biery wrote in his ruling.Biery, an appointee of former US President Bill Clinton, said deportations through the US immigration system should occur in a more orderly and humane policy than currently in place.While the father and son were still in the Texas detention centre, Castro had  written on social media that the young boy was not doing well being away from his family, classmates and home.  The Department of Homeland Security has said the pair entered the US illegally, while a lawyer for the family said they followed proper protocols to seek asylum.On Sunday, the DHS said in a statement to the BBC's US partner CBS News: \"The Trump administration is committed to restoring the rule of law and common sense to our immigration system, and will continue to fight for the arrest, detention, and removal of aliens who have no right to be in this country\".Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, a Democrat and outspoken critic of ICE, also posted on social media about the father and son's return to Minnesota. \"Liam is home now and we are grateful to [Joaquin Castro] for traveling to Minneapolis with him and his dad,\" Omar wrote. \"Welcome home Liam.\"There have been conflicting reports about what happened during the ICE operation where Ramos was first approached by ICE agents.Officials at the school Ramos attended have said the boy had just arrived home from pre-school when an ICE agent asked the child to knock on the door of the home to see if anyone else was there.A school official said another adult living in the home asked to take the young boy inside, but was refused.School board member Mary Granlund said she was on the scene and told immigration officials she could take Ramos, but they still detained him.In a post on X, ICE denied the child had been detained.\"A criminal illegal alien ABANDONED his child as he fled from ICE officers, and our officers ensured the child was kept SAFE in the bitter cold,\" the agency said.\"ICE made multiple attempts to get the family inside the house to take custody of the child. They refused to accept custody of the child. The father told officers he wanted the child to remain with him,\" the agency said.US Vice-President JD Vance told reporters ICE had no choice because \"the father ran\".Marc Prokosch, a lawyer representing the family, said the father and son \"did everything right\" when they came into the country from Ecuador in 2024.They entered the US at a port of entry to seek asylum, they used the CBP One app, they made an appointment, they presented themselves to Customs and Border Protection, and they have shared all their information with the government, Prokosch said.\"This family was not eluding ICE in any way. They were following all the established protocols pursuing their claim for asylum, showing up for their court hearings and pose no safety, no flight risk, and never should have been detained,\" Prokosch added.",

    "body": "7 hours agoGeorge WrightAFP via Getty ImagesIsrael says it will ban Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) from working in Gaza after the medical charity refused to hand over a list of its staff in the territory.The Israeli government had ordered 37 organisations to submit documents about their local and international workers in Gaza, claiming some in MSF had links to armed groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The charity has vehemently denied this.MSF announced on Friday that it would not share a list of its Palestinian and international staff with Israeli authorities as it had not secured \"assurances to ensure the safety of our staff\".In response, Israel said it was \"moving to terminate the activities\" of MSF in Gaza.The Israeli Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism said the decision followed \"MSF's failure to submit lists of local employees, a requirement applicable to all humanitarian organisations operating in the region\".On 30 December, Israel announced that it was going to revoke the licences of 37 international non-governmental organisations working in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, saying they had failed to meet new registration requirements.At the time the diaspora ministry said the measure was needed to prevent \"the infiltration of terrorist operatives into humanitarian structures\".The groups - which include MSF, ActionAid and the Norwegian Refugee Council - were told their operations must end within 60 days.The move was condemned by 10 countries, including the UK, France and Canada, who said the rules would have a severe impact on access to essential services.MSF said in a statement on Friday that it had informed Israeli authorities that, as an \"exceptional measure\", it would share a list of names of its Palestinian and international staff, \"subject to clear parameters, with our staff safety at its core\". \"However, despite repeated efforts, it became evident in recent days that we were unable to build engagement with Israeli authorities on the concrete assurances required,\" it said.\"These included that any staff information would be used only for its stated administrative purpose and would not put colleagues at risk.\"On Sunday, it said the move was a \"pretext to obstruct humanitarian assistance\" to Gaza.\"Israeli authorities are forcing humanitarian organisations into an impossible choice between exposing staff to risk or interrupting critical medical care for people in desperate need,\" it said. Sam Rose, director of Gaza affairs for the UN's Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa, told the BBC that this will have \"major negative consequences on the ability of international organisations to provide healthcare inside Gaza\".He said MSF had its own reasons for not handing over staff lists \"given the large numbers of staff of medical organisations and international organisations that have been killed over the past two years\". A total of 1,700 healthcare staff have been killed in the war, including 15 MSF staff, the medical charity says.MSF says it currently provides at least 20% of hospital beds in Gaza and operates around 20 health centres. Last year, it carried out more than 800,000 medical consultations and more than 10,000 infant deliveries, while providing drinking water.The latest war in Gaza began after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,660 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.It says at least 509 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire began on 10 October 2025. Four Israeli soldiers have also been killed.",

    "body": "6 hours agoJack BurgessGetty ImagesThe US immigration enforcement agency has faced increased criticism following the deaths of two US citizensFrench technology giant Capgemini has announced it will sell its US subsidiary after its work locating people for immigration enforcement agency ICE sparked outrage.Capgemini has come under pressure from French lawmakers over a contract its subsidiary signed with ICE, amid international scrutiny over the methods used by the agency's agents in Minnesota.Capgemini Government Solutions has been under contract since 18 December to provide \"skip tracing services for enforcement and removal operations\", public records show.Skip tracing services locate individuals whose whereabouts are unknown. Capgemini Government Solutions is set to be paid more than $4.8m (£3.5m) for its work tracing people for ICE, which is due to continue until 15 March, US government listings show. It is one of 13 contracts the subsidiary holds with ICE.Capgemini, one of the largest listed companies in France, said in a statement that it had not been able \"to exercise appropriate control over certain aspects of this subsidiary's operations in order to ensure alignment with the Group's objectives\".It added that \"the divestiture process of this business will be initiated immediately\".Criticism of ICE practices has intensified in recent weeks since the shooting of 37-year-old Pretti, the second fatal shooting of a US citizen since immigration agents began surging several cities across the US, acting on the Trump administration's drive to increase deportations of illegal immigrants.The killing of Pretti involved Border Patrol, an immigration agency which works alongside ICE, while Good was shot by an ICE agent.ICE has detained thousands since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House with a pledge to increase deportations. ICE enforcement actions have regularly occurred in public places, leading to a number of clashes with protesters.Last week, Capgemini's CEO Aiman Ezzat wrote on LinkedIn that \"we were recently made aware, through public sources, of the nature of a contract awarded to Capgemini Government Solutions by DHS' Immigration and Customs Enforcement in December 2025\". \"The nature and scope of this work has raised questions compared to what we typically do as a business and technology firm,\" he said.The revelation provoked outrage amongst French politicians.French Finance Minister Roland Lescure called for the company \"to be transparent\" about the contracts it has with ICE.Meanwhile, left-wing opposition MP Hadrien Clouet called for sanctions to be imposed on French firms working with ICE, commenting: \"French private companies are collaborating with ICE. We do not accept this.\"Capgemini was founded in 1967 and currently functions as an IT services and consulting firm. It currently has more than 340,000 employees worldwide and is valued at €22bn (£19bn).",

    "body": "22 hours agoMadeline HalpertColumbia Heights Public SchoolsA US judge has ordered the release of a five-year-old boy and his father from an immigration detention centre in Texas, condemning it as driven by a \"perfidious lust for unbridled power\".The detention of Liam Conejo Ramos, photographed wearing a blue bunny-shaped hat and a Spider-Man backpack, sparked national outcry after he was taken into custody on the driveway of his home in Minneapolis.The child's father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, was also detained.Following the outrage over the pre-schooler's detention, immigration officials said they did not \"target a child\" but were conducting an operation against his father, an \"illegal alien\" who \"abandoned\" his son when approached.On Saturday, US District Judge Fred Biery granted an emergency request from the family's lawyer, ordering government officials to release the father and son by 3 February. The judge also included a photo of Ramos in his fluffy blue hat in his ruling.\"The case has its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatising children,\" Biery wrote in his ruling. Biery, an appointee of former US President Bill Clinton, said deportations through the US immigration system should occur in a more orderly and humane policy than currently in place. \"Observing human behaviour confirms that for some among us, the perfidious lust for unbridled power and the imposition of cruelty in its quest know no bounds and are bereft of human decency,\" he wrote of the detention of Ramos. The BBC has contacted the Department of Homeland Security for comment. Marc Prokosch, a lawyer representing the family, said the boy and his father were being held at a detention centre in San Antonio, Texas. Prokosch said Ramos and his father had come to the US in 2024 from Ecuador to seek asylum and had been following the proper immigration protocols. In recent weeks, US President Donald Trump has ramped up immigration enforcement efforts in Minneapolis in an initiative dubbed \"Operation Metro Surge\".On Thursday, Trump officials suggested they may start pulling back federal forces in the state after a national outcry over the fatal shootings of two US citizens in Minneapolis by federal agents.In a separate ruling on Saturday, a federal judge denied a state government's request to block the Trump administration's deployment of thousands of immigration agents in Minneapolis, saying the state had not proven the activity was unlawful.

    "body": "15 hours agoMaia DaviesBBCOfficials say a gas leak was the blame for the explosion in Bandar AbbasFive people have been killed in two separate explosions in Iran which local officials and state media say were caused by gas leaks.One person was killed and 14 injured in a blast at a residential building in the southern city of Bandar Abbas on the Gulf coast, a local official told Iran's semi-official Mehr news agency.Another explosion killed four people in the south-western city of Ahvaz, the state-run Tehran Times reported.It comes as tensions persist in the region after a build-up of US forces in the Gulf and pressure on Tehran from US President Donald Trump to strike a deal on its nuclear programme.Trump was asked by journalists whether he had decided what to do in Iran while travelling to Florida on Saturday night and said: \"I certainly can't tell you that.\" But he added, reiterating comments made to Fox News earlier in the day, that Iran was talking \"seriously\" to Washington.He said he hoped they would negotiate something acceptable, and noted that the US had \"very big powerful ships\" in the region.Earlier, in the port city of Bandar Abbas, state TV said an explosion had ripped though an eight-storey building, \"destroying two floors, several vehicles, and shops\" in the Moallem Boulevard area.The local fire department chief Mohammad Amin Liaqat said a preliminary assessment showed it had been caused by a gas leak and \"build-up\".\"My colleagues will give more details in the next few hours,\" he said in a video published by Mehr.Mehrdad Hassanzadeh, a regional official, told the news agency that the injured had been taken to hospital.Semi-official news agency Tasnim denied social media reports that a Revolutionary Guards Corps navy commander had been targeted in the blast.Elsewhere, the Tehran Times reported a second explosion at a residential building in the Kianshahr neighbourhood of Ahvaz, near the border with Iraq.It reported that emergency officials had rescued a child trapped beneath debris and transferred him for medical treatment.Trump told Fox News on Saturday that Iran was \"negotiating\", adding that Washington could not share its plans with its allies in the Gulf.\"We'll see if we can do something, otherwise we'll see what happens... we have a big fleet heading out there.\"Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian said conflict would not be in the interest of either country, nor the broader region.\"The Islamic Republic of Iran has never sought and in no way seeks war,\" he said during a call with his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, news agency AFP reported, citing a statement from Iran's presidency.Separately, the head of the country's Supreme National Security Council Ali Larijani met the Qatari prime minister in Tehran on Saturday and \"reviewed ongoing efforts to de-escalate tensions in the region\", Qatar's foreign ministry said.Larijani, whom the Kremlin said had also met Russia's President Vladimir Putin for talks on Friday, wrote on X: \"Contrary to the hype of the contrived media war, structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing.\" Iran's foreign minister has said Tehran was open to talks with the US provided they were based on trust and respect, but cautioned that its missile defence system would \"never\" be the subject of negotiation.Trump told Tehran on Wednesday that time was \"running out\" for it to reach a deal on its nuclear programme - which Iran insists is peaceful - and later said they must also \"stop killing protesters\" to avoid military action.It came after he promised to intervene to help protesters who had been subject to a brutal crackdown in the country earlier this month, though he later said he had heard on good authority that the execution of demonstrators had stopped.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says it has confirmed the killing of more than 6,300 people since the unrest began in late December, and was investigating another 17,000 reported deaths.",

    "body": "10 hours agoJack BurgessAFP via Getty ImagesCasey Wasserman is the chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 OlympicsThe chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games has said he \"deeply regrets\" decades-old flirty emails with Ghislaine Maxwell - the jailed associate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Casey Wasserman's messages to Maxwell, sent in 2003, were among millions of files published by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) on Friday.In one exchange, Wasserman wrote to Maxwell: \"I think of you all the time... So what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?\" Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting and trafficking teenage girls to be sexually abused by the disgraced financier Epstein prior to his death in custody in 2019.\"I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light,\" Wasserman said in a statement.He also emphasised that he had \"never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein\".\"As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane,\" Wasserman said.\"I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.\"While the files do not show any wrongdoing on the part of those featured, including Wasserman, they have raised renewed questions for those who associated with the influential financier.Wasserman founded a sports and entertainment agency in 2002, and is a trustee of the non-profit Clinton Foundation, according to the Olympics website.Ghislaine Maxwell agreed last month to testify under oath before the congressional committee investigating the federal government's handling of the Epstein files.The committee also summoned both former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to testify.The former president appeared in photographs with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s.Bill Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein's abuse and has denied knowledge of his sex offending.Epstein, who was convicted of sexual offences in 2008, was found dead in his New York prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.",

    "body": "2 days agoMaia DaviesEPATrump declined to say whether there was a timeline for withdrawing a large US naval fleet from waters near IranDonald Trump has said Iran wants to make a deal rather than face US military action, despite Tehran's insistence that its missile and defence systems will \"never\" be up for negotiation.\"I can say this, they do want to make a deal,\" the US president told reporters at the White House on Friday when asked about a build-up of forces in the Gulf, without providing details.He had warned Tehran on Wednesday that time was \"running out\" to negotiate a deal on its nuclear programme after a large US naval fleet had gathered near the country.Iran's foreign minister said there were no talks planned with the US at present but that Tehran was open to negotiations based on \"mutual respect\" and trust.Also on Friday, the Kremlin said the head of the Iran's Supreme National Security Council Ali Larijani had met Russian President Vladimir Putin.They discussed \"Middle Eastern and international issues\" among other matters, state news agency Ria-Novosoti reported.Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and has repeatedly denied accusations by the US and its allies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.Asked on Friday whether he had given Tehran a deadline by which to strike a deal, Trump said that \"only they know for sure\".He told reporters: \"Hopefully we'll make a deal. If we do make a deal, that's good. If we don't make a deal, we'll see what happens.\"He said a large \"Armada\" was on its way to the region and declined to give a timeline for its withdrawal: \"We'll see how it all works out. They have to float someplace, so they might as well float near Iran.\"Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had said earlier that the country's missile defence systems would \"never\" be on the negotiating table, and repeated the government's position that its nuclear programme was peaceful.At a press conference with his Turkish counterpart after talks in Istanbul to avert US action, he said preparations were needed for \"fair and just negotiations\".He had said help was \"on the way\", before saying he had been told the execution of demonstrators had stopped.On Thursday, he said he had told Iran that it had to do two things to avoid military action: \"Number one, no nuclear. And number two, stop killing protesters.\"The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it had confirmed the killing of more than 6,300 people, including more than 5,900 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December.It said it was also investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks.Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned the final toll could exceed 25,000.",

    "body": "12 hours agoAleks PhillipsGetty ImagesMiroslav Lajčák denied any wrongdoing but said he was stepping down to avoid political ramificationsThe national security adviser to Slovakia's prime minister has resigned after documents released by the US showed he exchanged messages about girls and diplomacy with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Robert Fico announced he had accepted Miroslav Lajčák's departure in a video message on Saturday, describing the adviser as \"an incredible source of experience in diplomacy and foreign policy\".The resignation comes a day after three million files relating to the influential financier were released by the US Department of Justice.While the files do not show any wrongdoing on the part of those featured, including Lajčák, they have raised renewed questions for those who associated with Epstein.In a text exchange from October 2018 - when Lajčák was serving as Slovakia's foreign minister - Lajčák and Epstein could be seen lightheartedly discussing women and a forthcoming meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.After Epstein sent an image, which cannot be seen in the record, Lajčák replies: \"Why don't you invite me for these games? I would take the 'MI' girl\".\"Who wouldn't,\" Epstein texts back. \"You can have them both, I am not possessive. And their sisters.\"Later on in the conversation, Epstein can be seen imploring Lajčák to ask Lavrov to get him a t-shirt featuring Lavrov and Viltaly Churkin, a Russian ambassador to the UN who had died the previous year.\"You get the tee shirt. Then you get the girls,\" Epstein writes, to which Lajčák agrees.Epstein then says: \"No kidding their sisters are both swimming in the pool.\"\"That's not fair!\" Lajčák responds. \"Though they're all under 30. So. Probably too young for you,\" Epstein adds. \"Or should I say under 50.\"\"Don't be mean,\" Lajčák replies. \"You don't know me in action.\"Lajčák initially denied discussing women with Epstein when the files were released on Friday, according to Slovak media. He later reportedly said he had decided to resign to avoid damaging Fico politically.Fico characterised the outrage in Slovakia over Lajčák's association with Epstein as \"an attack against me\".\"I have not seen so much hypocrisy in his criticism for a long time, and from all sides,\" he said. Lajčák had served in four Slovak governments, three led by Fico, and as an international diplomat. The former foreign affairs minister had most recently been an EU special representative for the western Balkans.Among them are images of the former Duke of York, who was stripped of his titles over his association with the disgraced financier, that appear to show the former prince kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground.",

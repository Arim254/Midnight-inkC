    "body": "What growing up in war does to a child's brain - and how it really affects them years later13 hours agoFergal KeaneSpecial correspondent BBCContent warning: this article includes details about the impact of conflict on children in war zones and descriptions of injuries that some readers may find distressing.The first thing was that Abdelrahman's dad was killed. The family home was struck by an Israeli air strike. The boy's mum, Asma al-Nashash, 29, remembers that \"they brought him out in pieces\".Then on 16 July 2024 an air strike hit the school in Nuseirat, central Gaza. Eleven-year-old Abdelrahman was seriously wounded. Doctors had to amputate his leg.His mental state began to deteriorate. \"He started pulling his hair and hitting himself hard,\" Asma recalls. \"He became like someone who has depression, seeing his friends playing and running around… and he's sitting alone.\"When I meet Abdelrahman at a hospital in Jordan in May 2025, he is withdrawn and wary. Dozens of children have been evacuated to the Kingdom from Gaza for medical treatment.\"We will return to Gaza,\" he tells me. \"We will die there.\"Abdelrahman is one of thousands of traumatised children I've met in my nearly four decades of reporting on conflicts. Certain faces are embedded in my memory. Some as though I had only met them yesterday. They reflect the depth of terror inflicted on children in our time.AFP via Getty ImagesAFP via Getty ImagesAFP via Getty ImagesHundreds of thousands of children have lived through more than two years of war in GazaThe first was on a hilltop in Eritrea in the mid-1980s. Adonai Mikael was a child victim of an Ethiopian napalm strike, crying in agony as the wind blew dust on to his wounds. The cries, the expression of pure agony in his eyes sent me fleeing from the tent where he was being treated. In Belfast a few years later, I remember a boy following the coffin of his father, blown up by the IRA. Never before had I seen such a distance in anyone's eyes.In Sierra Leone during the civil war, there was the girl whose hands were hacked off by a drunken militiaman; from Soweto there is the image of a child helping her mother mop the blood of a murder victim on their doorstep; and in Rwanda the boy who broke down when I asked him why the other children called him \"Grenade\" – a moment of insensitivity I will always regret.He had been wounded by an explosion that killed his parents.Figures underscore the sheer scale of the crisis. In 2024, 520 million children were living in conflict zones - one in every five children worldwide - according to an analysis by the Peace Research Institute Oslo, which pieced together conflict records with population data to arrive at the estimate.Prof Theresa Betancourt, author of Shadows into Light, a book about former child soldiers, calls this \"the largest humanitarian disaster since World War Two\".She warns trauma has an impact that lasts long into the future. \"[It can affect] the developing architecture of the brain in young children, with lifelong consequences for learning, behaviour, and both physical and mental health.\"But given how much time has been spent researching the impact of war on children's minds, what can help?This is a question that has never been more relevant following this period of multiple global conflicts that have affected millions of children: from those Sudanese children who, in October, saw their mothers and sisters raped by militiamen in el-Fasher, Darfur; the youngsters abducted from Israel by Hamas on 7 October, 2023, many having witnessed the slaughter of family and neighbours; the children of Bucha in Ukraine whose parents were among the people massacred by Russian troops in February 2022; and the hundreds of thousands of children like Abdelrahman who have endured more than two years of war in Gaza.AFP via Getty ImagesGetty ImagesSudanese refugees in 2025I should declare a personal interest. I suffered from post traumatic stress disorder – PTSD both as a child in a broken home, and later as an adult, witnessing war and genocide. Though different from experiencing war as a child, I know the symptoms all too well: the extreme anxiety, hypervigilance – being constantly on guard against threats - flashbacks, nightmares, and depression. The symptoms were severe enough to require several hospitalisations.Personal experience has made me intensely curious about how children respond and are treated.\"The evidence is quite solid across different studies that the exposure to war and displacement is associated with a higher risk of mental health problems,\" says Michael Pluess, a professor of psychology at the University of Surrey.He has carried out long-term research into the children of Syrian war refugees, and cautions against making assumptions. \"It's important to recognise that children differ in how they respond.\"A variety of factors can influence the outcome. How long was the child exposed to the traumatic events? Were they physically wounded? Did they lose an important person in their life, or see them killed or injured? Did they have physical security and emotional support in the aftermath?In a sample of 2,976 children from Bosnia-Herzegovina - all of whom had been exposed to war and were aged between nine and 14 - high levels of post-traumatic symptoms and grief symptoms were reported.Getty ImagesGetty ImagesGetty ImagesBosnia-Herzegovina: Children in SarajevoBut there is the potential for long-term health damage – heart disease, autoimmune problems - linked to \"toxic stress\", where the body is flooded with hormones like cortisol and catecholamines, which produce adrenaline.There is also a developing field of research into epigenetics, which asks whether the experience of trauma by one generation can show up in later generations through changes in the way our genes behave.Are we more susceptible to, say, poor mental health, addictions or other health problems if our families have a history of trauma - and how much has this to do with genetics versus our family setups and everyday lives?The family drip-feed effectEpigenetics is a tentative and debated area of scientific research with much still to be learned.\"I think there is some evidence that there is a sort of intergenerational transmission of trauma,\" says Prof Pluess. \"Some of that or much of that will happen through social practice rather than biological practice, but there's some evidence to suggest that there are some epigenetic factors as well.\"Prof Metin Başoğlu, director of the Istanbul Centre for Behavioural Sciences, is sceptical. However, he says it is possible that certain temperament traits (for example, predispositions that are transmitted genetically across generations) might make some people more vulnerable to traumatic events.During research for a book on my own PTSD, I remember a conversation with one of Britain's most eminent experts in the field, Prof Simon Wessely, former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. I wondered whether my own family history – great-grandparents born during the Irish famine, a grandmother who was traumatised by her war experiences in the 1920s – could have made me more genetically predisposed to PTSD?\"There is simply no way of knowing, without studying a representative sample group from the same area, with ancestors born in the same place and subjected to the same conditions,\" he told me. \"I can't do it on one person…\"What I think is much easier to understand - and, I think, is also the most powerful - is the influence of our background. And it's absolutely impossible for you to have grown up in the household that you did, with the interests that you have, for that not to have the same effect on you.\"AFP via Getty ImagesAFP via Getty ImagesProf Pluess has carried out long-term research into the children of Syrian war refugees, and cautions against making assumptionsThere is broader consensus that trauma is a family crisis. It isn't only a question of what a child witnesses or survives – there is also the impact on adults.\"Not only do children in war zones face the death of caregivers and traumatic separations,\" says Prof Betancourt, \"but caregivers experiencing their own trauma and distress may not be fully available to help protect and guide their children through the horrors of war.\"Prof Pluess's research among Syrian refugees supports this. Among the 80% of children found to be vulnerable to more than one psychological disorder, family circumstances were critical.Around 1,600 families took part in a study, published in 2022, of Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Prof Pluess says that children's living conditions (such as access to safe housing, food, and schooling) were found to be \"about 10 times more predictive of their mental health\".Children who adapted more healthily may have \"had a social environment that was very protective, maybe the parents were able to shield them, maybe they had close friendships, relationships, maybe they have access to school, all those external things that sort of buffer the negative impact of war exposure.\"The roots of this knowledge in Britain go back to WW2 and the experience of children who lived through the Blitz – the eight months of German air attacks between September 1940 and May 1941.Getty ImagesHulton-Deutsch Collection/Corbis via Getty ImagesFox Photos/Getty Images\"The evidence is quite solid [...] exposure to war and displacement is associated with a higher risk of mental health problems,\" says Prof PluessProf Edgar Jones, of King's College London, points to a study of 212 children treated at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children during the war. When researchers went back to the children in 1949 – four years after the conflict ended – they found only 21% had recovered. The role of parents – both positive and negative – emerged as an important finding.\"The severity of a child's reaction to bombing was judged to be influenced by their parents' response to the trauma either to accentuate or calm their anxiety,\" says Prof Jones.Overcoming fear and establishing controlIn my own experience, therapy and medication helped, but also the ongoing support of family and friends. Without the power of caring relationships I don't believe I could have emerged from the darkness.I was also encouraged to confront my avoidance of anything that might remind me of the trauma. For example, I went through a long period of avoiding travel to the continent of Africa, fearing that simply being there would trigger reminders of the Rwandan genocide. But my therapist gradually encouraged me to face the fear. It took several years but I did return, and continue to visit places there that are dear to my heart.Prof Başoğlu pioneered the use of what is called CFBT – Control Focused Behavioural Treatment - among survivors of the 1999 Turkish earthquake, which killed about 18,000 people.The idea is to encourage the individual to take control of their fear of the event recurring. In the case of children who were constantly clinging to their parents, this was attempted by encouraging them to get used to sleeping alone.\"Once they overcome their fear, all the traumatic stress reactions that are associated with fear also improve,\" Prof Başoğlu says.Israeli psychologists working with children released from Hamas captivity after the 7 October attacks also stress the importance of re-establishing a sense of control.Getty ImagesAFP via Getty ImagesGetty ImagesGlobal conflicts have affected millions of children, including the young people abducted from Israel by Hamas on 7 October, 2023, those who witnessed the slaughter of family and neighbours that day, and those dealing with the aftermathIn a paper for the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health journal, a team of Israeli specialists wrote that this was achieved \"by providing survivors with information and space to express their concerns while ensuring that their needs and voices are heard\".But successful interventions depend greatly on creating a stable environment where the fear of being killed or maimed is not an ever-present reality.\"What they also need is that their parents are well, that they live in a safe place, that they have access to education, that they have a routine, that they have some predictability,\" says Prof Pluess.This is rarely certain in areas ravaged by war. Ceasefires break down. Front lines become frozen. The displaced are stuck in camps.'We were dehumanised'Still, those words about a safe place bring to mind my friend Beata and the difference stability made to her life.She was 15 years old when the Rwandan genocide – the worst mass slaughter since the Nazi Holocaust – erupted in 1994. Up to 800,000 people, mostly members of the Tutsi minority, were massacred over a period of 100 days.As a reporter I travelled on the convoy that evacuated dozens of orphaned children - Beata Umubyeyi Mairesse among them - through roadblocks manned by the murderous Interahamwe militia. It was a terrifying experience, but especially for the children whose families had been killed.From roadblock to roadblock, we did not know if the machete-wielding gangs would attack.Years later when she was researching her experiences (later published in a book, The Convoy), Beata got in touch. I remember being struck by her composure and openness. She is married with two children, lives in France and is now a successful writer.\"The first thing that helped me was exile to France, leaving the scene of the genocide. I found myself safe, in a peaceful place, with shelter, a foster family who took care of all my material needs, and the opportunity to see a psychologist. I went back to school in September, and that helped me too.\"VCG via Getty ImagesMirrorpix/Getty ImagesLiaison/ Getty ImagesGlobal conflicts that have affected millions of children - in 1994, up to 800,000 people were massacred in Rwanda over a period of 100 days Beata was joined by her mother who also survived. Her father had died before the slaughter.Composed as she was, there were lingering terrors. She panicked one night when classical music was played on the radio – similar to music played on Rwandan radio the night the genocide began. Fireworks or the sound of hunters shooting sent her hiding under a desk in class \"because I thought war had broken out in France\".I wondered if she makes a conscious effort to protect her children from the traumatic inheritance of genocide. \"There are things that are difficult to tell your children, how we were dehumanised, how I was almost raped. The term 'unspeakable' makes sense when passing on stories to children. We are afraid of contaminating them with our trauma.\"But for Beata, nuance is vital. \"Their only image of Rwanda should not be the genocide. I told them stories from my childhood and every time I went there I brought them back fruit so that they could also discover a country full of flavour.\"Although she lives a full and happy life, Beata still suffers from anxiety and takes anti-depressants to deal with insomnia. I also use medication, and like Beata I do not see it as a burden or a stigma. Rather I count myself fortunate to be able to access care and medicine.Fergal Keane (second from right) in Rwanda after the genocideCreating a safe community is also seen as critical by many experts.\"They're not just victims of mental health,\" says Prof Pluess. \"They're little people with interests and that's why they need to go to school, they need to have opportunities to play together - and that might be as important as dealing with the mental health problems that they're facing.\"Psychologists working in Gaza are well aware of these needs. Davide Musardo, who volunteered with Medecins Sans Frontieres, has written of trying to provide therapy against the background of drones and explosions.\"In Gaza, one survives but the exposure to trauma is constant. Everything is missing, even the idea of a future. For people, the greatest anguish is not of today — the bombs, the fighting, and the mourning — but of the aftermath. There is little confidence about peace and reconstruction, and the children I saw in the hospital showed clear signs of regression.\"It is possible, in devastated Gaza, that the current ceasefire will become a permanent peace, allowing rebuilding, and the restoration of family life and schooling. Possible but by no means certain. In Sudan there are attempts to re-start talks about peace but little optimism for their outcome. The war in Ukraine, and many other wars grind on every day.Trauma is as old as war itself. Politicians, journalists, and experts looking to the aftermath of a conflict often ask, \"What will happen when the killing stops?\" But somewhere else the killing will continue. That is the relentless tragedy of children caught in wars they did not start, over which they have no control. For all the knowledge gained about treating trauma, humanity is far from dealing with its root cause – war itself.Additional reporting by Harriet WhiteheadTop picture credit: EPA/ShutterstockMore from InDepthBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "A five-year-old boy in Japan has died while on a ski holiday with his family after his arm caught on a travelator.On Sunday morning Hinata Goto was about to step off the travelator at a Hokkaido resort's ski slopes when he fell down and his right arm became trapped in the machinery, Japanese media reported citing police. The travelator was equipped with a safety mechanism, but it failed to activate. The machine only halted when the boy's mother hit the emergency stop button.Rescue workers spent 40 minutes dismantling part of the travelator to free the boy, who by then had fallen unconscious. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital.Staff at the Asarigawa Onsen Ski Resort in Otaru said that the travelator's safety mechanism, which was designed to immediately halt operations if it detected that an object was trapped in the machinery, had worked earlier in the day.Police are investigating the incident to assess whether there was any professional negligence, such as in the manufacturing and maintenance of the travelator.Installed about six years ago, the travelator is about 30m (98 ft) long and 60cm (24 in) wide, with no hand rails. It connects the resort's car park to the ski slopes.Japanese media quoted other visitors saying that they have stumbled while using the same travelator. \"Even as an adult, there are times when I think, 'It's a little scary',\" a regular customer told Asahi Shimbun.A representative of Asarigawa Onsen Ski Resort apologised for the incident and said they will take action to prevent a recurrence.Hokkaido is known to be the ski capital of Japan and welcomes millions of visitors every year, with the bulk of them staying during the winter months for ski holidays.",

    "body": "The two alleged gunmen who killed 15 people at a Jewish event on Bondi Beach were not part of a wider terror cell and acted alone, Australian police have said.Police also confirmed Sajid Akram, 50, and his son Naveed Akram, 24, travelled to the Philippines on 1 November, landing in the capital Manila before transiting that day to Davao City. They returned to Sydney on 29 November.The pair did not undergo training or \"logistical preparation\" in the Philippines for the 14 December attack with early investigations from local authorities suggesting they \"rarely left their hotel,\" police said.Police have declared the attack - Australia's worst mass shooting since 1996 - a terrorist incident.Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett told media on Tuesday that CCTV footage tracking the alleged gunmen's movements in the Philippines had been handed to Australian authorities. \"We are currently reviewing the material,\" she said, adding that initial assessments show that \"these individuals are alleged to have acted alone\".\"There is no evidence to suggest these alleged offenders were part of a broader terrorist cell, or were directed by others to carry out an attack.\"But nor were the pair in the Philippines for tourism, Commissioner Barrett said.She emphasised that as the investigation was ongoing, new evidence or information may emerge.Earlier, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said it appears both alleged gunmen were  \"motivated by Islamic State\" ideology.Sajid Akram was shot dead by police during the attack in which he and his son Naveed - both armed with long-barrelled guns - allegedly shot attendees at a Hanukkah event on Bondi Beach.Naveed, who was hospitalised after the attack, has been charged with 59 offences including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act and is due to face court in April.In the days after the shooting, the Philippines immigration bureau told the BBC that the father had entered the country using an Indian passport while his son used an Australian passport. Immigration spokesperson Dana Sandoval said the duo had declared the southern city of Davao as their final destination and their return flight to Australia was for Sydney.Davao is a sprawling metropolis on the east of the Philippines' main southern island, Mindanao. Islamist militants have been known to operate in impoverished parts of central and south-western Mindanao.Additional reporting by Virma Simonette.",

    "body": "The Albanian nationalist Vetevendosje party has won a landslide victory in Kosovo's parliamentary elections, according to preliminary results. With 90% of the votes counted, the party, whose name means \"self determination\", was on 50.8%, meaning a third term in power for its leader, Albin Kurti. The two main opposition parties, the centre-right Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) and the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), were on 20.98% and 13.89%, respectively.Vetevendosje won elections in February, but without a majority, and Kosovo has been without a functioning government since then. The impasse meant there was one big question hanging over this second parliamentary election of the year. Would voters punish Kurti for the long months of deadlock in the country's National Assembly – or the opposition parties who refused to countenance a coalition with Kurti's left-wing movement?The electorate has given a clear answer. This will not be quite enough to deliver enough seats for Kurti to govern without coalition partners. But he should not find it difficult to find support among the MPs from the ethnic minority parties who are guaranteed 20 of the 120 seats in the National Assembly.It is the fourth successive victory in parliamentary elections for Vetevendosje. The result is vindication after the opposition parties blocked his attempts to form a government following the previous polls on February 9.Kurti claimed it was \"the greatest victory in the history of the country\" – and said he expected opposition parties to cooperate, rather than frustrate, this time around.Arben Gashi, of the third-placed Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), indicated that could be possible. \"When voters speak, the result cannot be ignored,\" he posted on social media. \"Reflection and responsible action are required,\" he added.There is plenty at stake. Kosovo has missed out on hundreds of millions of euros' worth of European Union funds because of the lack of a functioning government. Kurti also cited potential agreements with the World Bank which would bring the total sum to more than €1bn.Repairing relations with Kosovo's strongest international supporters, the EU and the US, should also be on the agenda. Kurti angered Brussels and Washington by repeatedly targeting institutions serving Kosovo's Serb minority – from post offices to healthcare facilities. This increased tensions in majority-Serb north Kosovo.The EU has finally agreed to remove the punitive measures it imposed in 2023. But it will be looking for Kurti to take a pragmatic approach to the long-stalled normalisation dialogue with Serbia, rather than stick to his usual dogmatic line. Given his frosty relations with Serbia's president, Aleksandar Vucic, this may be a vain hope.The fact that Kosovo's voters have resoundingly endorsed such a polarising figure reflects their jaundiced view of the alternatives. Parties connected to the Kosovo Liberation Army dominated government in the decade following 2008's unilateral declaration of independence – but failed to deliver on their promises of prosperity.One analyst, Artan Muhaxhiri, noted Vetevendosje's \"countless violations of the constitution, the lack of economic development and the breakdown of relations with allies\" over its years in power. But he concluded that \"despite all the shortcomings, citizens have considered the opposition to be more harmful\".",

    "body": "1 day agoYvette TanGetty ImagesThe Thai army said more than 250 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were detected flying from the Cambodian sideThailand's army has accused Cambodia of breaching a newly signed ceasefire deal reached after weeks of deadly clashes that forced nearly one million people from their homes. In a statement, the Thai army said more than 250 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were detected flying from the Cambodian side on Sunday night.The ceasefire took effect at noon local time (05:00 GMT) on Saturday. Both sides agreed to freeze the front lines where they are now, ban reinforcements and allow civilians living in border areas to return as soon as possible.It had been seen as a breakthrough, which came after days of talks between both countries, with diplomatic encouragement from China and the US. In a statement on Monday, the Royal Thai Army said Cambodia's actions \"constitute provocation and a violation of measures aimed at reducing tensions\", adding that they were \"inconsistent\" with the terms of the ceasefire.It also said it \"may need to reconsider\" the release of 18 Cambodian soldiers held in Thailand since July. Thailand would be \"obliged to act in accordance... [if] violations of agreements and national sovereignty continue\", it added.Cambodian Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn described the incident as \"a small issue related to flying drones seen by both sides along the border line,\" according to AFP news agency. It comes just hours after China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi praised the \"hard-won\" ceasefire, and US President Donald Trump praised the \"rapid and fair conclusion\".The dispute between Thailand and Cambodia is not new, dating back more than a century.The latest tensions ramped up earlier this year, after a group of Cambodian women sang patriotic songs in a disputed temple.A Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash in May. This plunged relations between the countries to their lowest point in more than a decade.There were five days of intense fighting along the border, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead. Thousands more civilians were displaced.A fragile ceasefire deal was agreed in July and signed in October. It then collapsed earlier this month, when fresh clashes erupted. Both sides blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce.",

    "body": "Brazil's imprisoned former president, Jair Bolsonaro, has undergone a second medical procedure in just three days to treat his persistent hiccups. Doctors performed a \"phrenic nerve block procedure\" on Bolsonaro to block his left phrenic nerve, after treating Bolsonaro's right one on Saturday. The phrenic nerve can be found in the neck and is vital in controlling the diaphragm, which controls breathing. The far-right former leader is currently serving a 27-year sentence after plotting a coup to overturn the 2022 election.The latest treatments follow a recent surgery for the former president amid ongoing health complications.Dr Claudio Birolini said that Bolsonaro's \"condition is stable\" following his second procedure for chronic hiccups on Monday. Birolini said he did not \"believe the hospitalisation will be prolonged much longer\".Bolsonaro was expected to leave hospital on 1 January if his recovery went well, his medical team said.Bolsonaro, 70, received his first treatment for recurring hiccups on Saturday, which his doctors said \"went well\".Days earlier, on Christmas Day, he underwent a successful surgery for a double hernia, his wife Michelle confirmed.Brazil's Supreme Court allowed the 70-year-old to be transferred from federal police headquarters where he is serving his sentence to a hospital in the capital, Brasília, for the initial surgery.Bolsonaro had been suffering from recurring hiccups for months, and his medical team deemed it necessary to treat them following his successful surgery.\"It's been nine months of struggle and anguish with daily hiccups,\" Bolsonaro's wife, Michelle, said on Saturday.Prior to the hernia surgery, the former president underwent intestinal surgery in April.Bolsonaro has endorsed his son Flávio to run against Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in the 2026 presidential election. Bolsonaro lost the 2022 presidential election to his left-wing opponent Lula.",

    "body": "The Spanish parishioner who made headlines around the world for her botched restoration of a prized Jesus Christ fresco has died aged 94.Cecilia Giménez, an elderly woman from Borja, northeast Spain, became famous 13 years ago after she attempted to restore the century-old painting titled Ecce Homo that was held in her local church.Giménez's restoration went viral and earned the nickname \"Monkey Christ\", because of Christ's head resembling a hairy monkey. The 94-year-old's death was confirmed by Borja's mayor, Eduardo Arilla, in a Facebook post, in which he recognised her as a \"great lover of painting from a young age\".Mayor Arilla paid tribute to Giménez's \"famous restoration of Ecce Homo\" in August 2012, which \"due to the poor state of conservation it presented, Cecilia, with the best intentions, decided to repaint the work over\".The Ecce Homo (\"Behold the Man\" in Latin) by 19th century painter Elias Garcia Martinez has been held for more than 100 years in the Sanctuary of Mercy Church near Zaragoza. In 2012, Giménez, then 81, told BBC News that church members had \"always repaired everything here\", and that she had permission from the local priest to do so. Giménez said at the time anybody who entered the Church would have seen she was painting over the original. The impact of the restoration led to the \"Monkey Christ\" meme and saw the once quiet town of Borja quickly become a tourist destination. The town, which had previously welcomed just 5,000 visitors per year, received more than 40,000 tourists by 2013, and raised more than €50,000 for charity at the time. Officials say nowadays between 15,000 and 20,000 tourists per year visit Borja to see the famous portrait, which is now behind a protective shield of glass.After recovering from the backlash, with support from local residents and others around the world, Giménez went on to stage an art exhibition with 28 of her own paintings. She was praised by Borja's mayor for her generosity and years of dedication to the church. \"Rest in peace Cecilia, we will always remember you,\" Mayor Arilla wrote on Facebook.",

    "body": "6 hours agoSofia Ferreira SantosX/Ali YerlikayaA video shared on social media by Turkey's interior minister appears to show several people being detainedMore than 350 suspected Islamic State group (IS) members have been detained as part of nationwide police operations in Turkey.Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said 357 suspects were apprehended across 21 provinces in coordinated raids on Tuesday morning.It comes just a day after three police officers and six alleged militants were killed during an eight hour siege in the northwestern town of Yalova. Another eight police officers and a security force member were injured.Less than a week ago, authorities arrested another 115 suspects who prosecutors said had been planning attacks targeting non-Muslims during Christmas and New Year's.In a post on X, Yerlikaya said Tuesday's operations took place across the country, including in Ankara, Istanbul and Yalova.\"Just as we have never given an opportunity to those who try to bring this country to its knees with terrorism, we will never give them an opportunity in the future either,\" he added.The interior minister also shared a video appearing to show dozens of counter-terrorism officers taking part in the operations and detaining several people.Raids on addresses in Istanbul and two other provinces - where 110 people were detained, according to the prosecutor's office - saw officers seize documents and digital materials, while pictures on local media also showed a number of weapons, including knifes and bullets.A statement from the Istanbul chief prosecutor's office said intelligence had suggested the suspects might attempt an attack on New Year's Day.It also noted 41 of those detained had suspected links to the clash in Yalova on Monday.Interior minister Yerlikaya said another 16 individuals had been detained in Yalova for making \"provocative posts\" on social media.The funerals of the three offices killed in Yalova - named as  İlker Pehlivan, Turgut Külünk, and Yasin Koçyiğit - were held on Tuesday.President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan offered his condolences to their families, and said Turkey would continue its fight against \"bloodthirsty criminals who threaten the peace of our nation and the security of our state\".Earlier this month, authorities carried out mass raids and arrested 115 people. Officials said IS supporters had been actively planning attacks across Turkey, particularly against non-Muslims on Christmas and New Year's Day.ReutersThe siege on a house in Yalova lasted around eight hours, according to local mediaTurkey's security services regularly target people with suspected links to IS.The country shares a 900km (560 mile) border with Syria, where the group continues to operate in parts of the country.Syria's president Ahmed al-Sharaa, who has close ties to the Turkish government, has vowed to work with the US and Europe to root out surviving elements of IS.The US launched a wave of air strikes against the group's positions across Syria on Friday in response to the killing of three Americans.Two US soldiers and a civilian interpreter were killed by IS gunmen during an ambush earlier this month.",

    "body": "21 hours agoNavin Singh KhadkaEnvironment correspondent, BBC World ServiceDavid LianoOfficials say the problem of waste piling up is more evident on higher camps of EverestA scheme to encourage climbers to bring their waste down from Mount Everest is being scrapped - with Nepalese authorities telling the BBC it has been a failure.Climbers had been required to pay a deposit of $4,000 (£2964), which they would only get back if they brought at least 8kg (18lbs) of waste back down with them.It was hoped it would begin to tackle the rubbish problem on the world's highest peak, which is estimated to be covered in some 50 tonnes of waste.But after 11 years - and with the rubbish still piling up  - the scheme is being shelved because it \"failed to show a tangible result\".David LianoClean-up campaigns have usually focused on lower camps of Mt Everest as it is difficult and costly to operate at higher altitudes Himal Gautam, director at the tourism department, told the BBC that not only had the garbage issue \"not gone away\", but the deposit scheme itself had \"become an administrative burden\".Tourism ministry and mountaineering department officials told the BBC most of the deposit money had been refunded over the years - which should mean most climbers brought back their trash.But the scheme is said to have failed because the rubbish climbers have brought back is usually from lower camps - not the higher camps where the garbage problem is worst. \"From higher camps, people tend to bring back oxygen bottles only,\" said Tshering Sherpa, chief executive officer of the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee, which runs an Everest checkpoint. \"Other things like tents and cans and boxes of packed foods and drinks are mostly left behind there, that is why we can see so much of waste piling up.\"Mr Sherpa said on average a climber produces up to 12kg (26lbs) of waste on the mountain where they spend up to six weeks for acclimatisation and climbing.Apart from the \"flawed rule\" that required climbers to bring back less trash than they produce, authorities in the Everest region said lack of monitoring has been the main challenge.\"Apart from the check point above the Khumbu Icefall, there is no monitoring of what climbers are doing,\" said Mr Sherpa. Nepalese authorities are hoping a new scheme will be more effective.Getty ImagesEven the lower parts of the Everest region below the base camp see abandoned waste by visitors and trekkersUnder the changed rule, officials said, a non-refundable clean-up fee from climbers will be used to set up a checkpoint at Camp Two and also deploy mountain rangers who will keep going to the higher parts of the mountain to make sure climbers bring down their trash.Tourism ministry officials said it will most probably be $4,000 per climber - the same amount as deposit money - and will come into effect once passed by the parliament. Mingma Sherpa, chairperson of the Pasang Lhamu rural municipality, said the change was something the Sherpa community had lobbied for for many years now.\"We had been questioning the effectiveness of the deposit scheme all this time because we are not aware of anyone who was penalised for not bringing their trash down.\"And there was no designated fund but now this non-refundable fee will lead to creation of a fund that can enable us to do all these clean-up and monitoring works.\"Getty ImagesIncreasing number of climbers on Mount Everest has been a growing concern for sustainable mountaineering The non-refundable fee will form part of a recently introduced five-year mountain clean-up action plan, with Jaynarayan Acarya, spokesperson at the ministry of tourism, saying it was designed \"to immediately address the pressing problem of waste on our mountains\".Although there has been no study quantifying the waste on Everest, it is estimated there are tons of it including human excrement which does not decay on the higher part of the mountain because of freezing temperature.And the growing number of climbers each year, averaging around 400 with many more supporting staff, has been a growing concern for mountaineering sustainability.",

    "body": "The United States has pledged $2 billion (£1.5bn) to fund United Nations (UN) humanitarian programmes, but has warned the UN it must \"adapt or die\". The announcement was made in Geneva by Jeremy Lewin, President Trump's Under Secretary for Foreign Assistance, and the UN's emergency relief chief, Tom Fletcher.It comes amid huge cuts in US funding for humanitarian operations, and further cuts expected from other donors, such as the UK and Germany.Mr Fletcher welcomed the new funds, saying they would save \"millions of lives\". But $2 billion is just a fraction of what the US has traditionally spent on aid. In 2022 its contribution to the UN's humanitarian work was estimated at $17 billion (£12.6bn).And the funding comes with some strings attached. Although UN donors do sometimes earmark specific projects, the UN funding prioritises just 17 countries, among them Haiti, Syria, and Sudan.Afghanistan and Yemen will not, Mr Lewin said, receive any money, adding that Washington had evidence that in Afghanistan UN funds were being diverted to the Taliban and that \"President Trump will never tolerate a penny of taxpayers' money going to terrorist groups\".Such restrictions will be hard for aid agencies working in countries not on the list. The impact of funding cuts has already led to the closure of mother and baby clinics in Afghanistan, and reductions in food rations for displaced people in Sudan. Globally, child mortality, which has been declining, is set to rise this year.The conditions placed on the new US funding also rule out spending money on projects related to tackling climate change, which Mr Lewin said were not \"life saving\", and not in \"the US interest\".Mr Lewin, a Trump loyalist who reportedly masterminded the shutdown of USAID and the firing of its thousands of staff, warned the UN that it must \"adapt or die\", saying that the US \"piggy bank is not open to those organisations that just want to return to the old system\".The US says funding must be focused and efficient, with no duplication among aid projects. These are qualities Tom Fletcher, and the entire UN system, say they wholeheartedly support. It's in no-one's interests, least of all those of the estimated 200 million people caught up in crises, for money to be spent unwisely.But while the UN is gratefully welcoming the new US funding, there remain big questions about whether the conditions around it are too politicised. The fundamental principles of humanitarian aid are that it should be neutral, impartial, and directed at those most in need. Eliminating specific countries, or specific crises such as climate change, challenges those principles.But, as it struggles with a continued funding crises, and, in Washington, a very skeptical donor, many in the UN will be acknowledging that $2 billion is better than nothing.",

    "body": "2 days agoVitaliy ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC MonitoringThe much-anticipated talks lasted two-and-a-half hours, and that's an achievement in itself. Presidents Trump and Zelensky had never before spent this long in one room, negotiating.Afterwards, optimism was much on display at Mar-a-Lago. It was a \"terrific meeting\", according to Donald Trump. Volodymyr Zelensky agreed, describing it as a \"great meeting\" with \"great discussions on all the topics\".But even if the two presidents sounded more upbeat than before, yet again we did not hear any evidence of progress - just like after all the previous talks held this year.Trump says progress made in Ukraine talks but 'thorny issues' remainThere is still no answer to the key question of whether Ukraine will have to give up territory in exchange for a promise of peace. This is one of the main demands put forward by Russia and apparently backed by the US, so the fact that Zelensky has not accepted it - at least not in public - counts as good news for Ukraine. He did appear to leave the possibility of territorial concessions open, however, by saying that a referendum may be held to approve any deals to end the war.There is also no clarity on another crucial issue: security guarantees. Even though President Zelensky says they were \"100%\" agreed with the US, we do not know what they are and whether they would be enough to deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again.No less importantly, regardless of what agreements presidents Trump and Zelensky may have reached, there is no reason to assume that Russia would accept them. In fact, it has already rejected key ideas floated immediately before the talks in Florida: that a ceasefire be declared and a multinational force be deployed to Ukraine to monitor it.And this begs the question of what Donald Trump is prepared to do should Russia reject his agreements with Volodymyr Zelensky. So far, it has been the Ukrainian leader who has borne the brunt of his pressure, irritation and anger. Donald Trump's continuing positive rhetoric about Vladimir Putin (who, the US president said today, is \"serious\" about peace and \"wants to see Ukraine succeed\") suggests that this is unlikely to change.At the end of the day, all this means that despite Donald Trump's and Volodymyr Zelensky's optimism, we've seen little indication that lasting peace will prevail in Ukraine any time soon.",

    "body": "5 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorCharly Hel/Prestige/Getty ImagesBrigitte Bardot died on Sunday aged 91 and had long shunned the limelight, preferring the company of animalsFrench right-wing figure Éric Ciotti has called for a national tribute to honour film legend Brigitte Bardot, prompting objections from political opponents on the left.\"France has a duty to honour its Marianne,\" said Ciotti, referring to the emblem of French liberty whose face Bardot was chosen to represent in the 1960s.Bardot died on Sunday aged 91. A petition launched by Ciotti since has attracted more than 23,000 signatures, and has the backing of some allies on the far right.But Socialist leader Olivier Faure has pointed out that national homages are for \"exceptional services to the nation\". Bardot was an iconic actress but she also \"turned her back on republican values\", Faure argued.Bardot has been hailed by President Emmanuel Macron as a \"legend of the century\" who embodied a life of freedom, and Ciotti, who leads the right-wing UDR party, has appealed to him to organise a national send-off.  Ciotti said France should recognise a woman who brought her country an extraordinary level of international recognition and actively helped in the fight for  women's liberty and abortion rights.Meanwhile, the mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, has announced that his city will name an \"iconic site\" in Bardot's honour. But Bardot is destined to remain controversial in death as she was during her life. Faure pointed out that she had been convicted five times for inciting racial hatred.Bardot starred in some 50 films, after bursting on to the scene in And God Created Woman in 1956. She then left the world of cinema in 1973 for a life devoted to animal welfare, and lived for decades in Saint-Tropez on the French Riviera, at her home called La Madrague.But she became as well known for her far-right sympathies as she was for her love of animals. Some of her remarks targeted Muslims, and others insulted the people of the French Indian Ocean island of Réunion.\"To be moved by the plight of dolphins and yet be indifferent to the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean - what degree of cynicism is that?\" asked Green MP Sandrine Rousseau on social media.There are differing types of national tribute in France. Robert Badinter, who abolished the death penalty in France, was honoured with a national homage in the form of a solemn ceremony in 2024, as was singer Charles Aznavour in 2018. A more likely option for Bardot would be along the lines of the public farewell given to rock star Johnny Hallyday, when large crowds lined the streets of Paris in 2017.Not everyone on the left is opposed to the idea of a national homage to Bardot.\"Why not? We've done it for other figures, particularly Johnny Hallyday,\" Socialist MP Philippe Brun told French radio. \"If the president of the republic decides on it, I don't see why we should oppose it.\"MIGUEL MEDINA/AFPBardot will be buried near her family's graves in the marine cemetery in Saint-TropezBardot herself had shunned the limelight for decades and close friend Wendy Bouchard said she was not remotely interested in medals and ceremonies.\"It probably comes from a good place, but I'm not sure that she, who lived a life of simplicity and deprivation, would have wanted this national homage,\" she told French TV.Journalist Steven Bellery, who interviewed Bardot earlier this year, agreed she wanted something far more simple and intimate.Bardot had asked to be buried at her Riviera home at La Madrague, rather than in a public cemetery, where she feared \"a crowd of idiots might damage the graves of my parents and grandparents\".However, the town hall in Saint-Tropez has said she will have a private burial in the public cemetery that overlooks the Mediterranean as well as her home.The Brigitte Bardot Foundation, which is dedicated to animal welfare, says her funeral will take place on 7 January at the Notre-Dame de l'Assomption church and will be broadcast on screens across the town.",

    "body": "Donald Trump said he hoped to reach phase two of the Gaza peace plan \"very quickly\", as he warned Hamas would have \"hell to pay\" if it did not disarm soon.The US president, whose 20-point peace plan requires the militant group to disarm, made the comments as he met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Florida for talks on Monday. During a press conference with Netanyahu after their meeting, Trump said Israel had \"lived up to the plan 100%\", despite continuing attacks by its military in Gaza.The US president also said his country could support another major strike on Iran were it to resume rebuilding its ballistic missile or nuclear weapons programmes.In response to Trump's threat, Iran's supreme leader's top political adviser, Ali Shamkhani, said on X that any aggression towards Iran would be met with an \"immediate harsh response\".Asked how quickly Hamas and Israel should move to phase two of the peace plan,  Trump said: \"As quickly as we can. But there has to be disarmament.\"Speaking about Hamas, he said: \"If they don't disarm as, as they agreed to do, they agreed to it, and then there will be hell to pay for them.\"They have to disarm in a fairly short period of time\".Trump also said reconstruction in Gaza could \"begin pretty soon\".The Gaza peace plan came into effect in October. Under the second phase, a technocratic government would be established in the devastated territory, Hamas would disarm and Israeli troops would withdraw. The reconstruction of Gaza would then begin.But critics have suggested Netanyahu could seek to delay the process of the plan and instead push for Hamas to disarm before Israeli troops withdraw. The Israeli prime minister has been accused of not wanting to engage seriously with the issue of a political future for Palestinians. Hamas officials have said a full disarmament should take place alongside progress towards an independent Palestinian state.Asked if he was concerned Israel was not moving fast enough to phase two of the plan, Trump said it had \"lived up to the plan\".\"I'm not concerned about anything that Israel's doing, I'm concerned about what other people are doing or maybe aren't doing,\" he added.Since the ceasefire came into effect, at least 414 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.The Israeli military, which controls more than half of Gaza, has said it has only opened fire in response to ceasefire violations. It has blamed Hamas for the killings of three Israeli soldiers over the same period.During the press briefing, Trump also warned that the US would launch further attacks on Iran if it was found to be using different sites to develop nuclear weapons.In June, Trump claimed US air and missile strikes \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear facilities. Iran has denied seeking to develop nuclear weapons. \"I hope they're not trying to build up again, because if they are we're going to have no choice but to eradicate that build up,\" he said. Trump said he \"had been reading\" that the country was using \"possibly different sites\" to those targeted in summer.Iran, which fought a 12-day war with Israel in June, on Monday denounced the reports as a \"psychological operation\" against Tehran. It said it was fully prepared to defend itself, and warned renewed aggression would \"result in harsher consequences\" for Israel.Trump and Netanyahu's talks also focused on other regional tension points, including Syria and the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon.Netanyahu said on Monday that Israel was keen to ensure a peaceful border with Syria, and Trump said he hoped Israel would get along with President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who took power after longtime strongman Bashar al-Assad was deposed last year.Israel has been suspicious of the new leader, who was once a member of al-Qaeda, and bombed government buildings in Damascus in July.\"Well, I hope he's [Netanyahu] going to get along with Syria because the new president of Syria is working very hard to do a good job,\" Trump said. \"He really is. I know he's a tough cookie. And, you know, you're not going to get a choir boy to lead Syria.\" Trump signed an executive order in June to end US sanctions against Syria.",

    "body": "Saudi Arabia has backed a demand from Yemen's presidential council for the United Arab Emirates to withdraw within 24 hours, after a Saudi-led coalition bombed what it said was a weapons shipment for UAE-backed separatists at the port of Mukalla.The Saudi foreign ministry accused the UAE of \"pressuring\" the Southern Transitional Council (STC), which seeks independence for southern Yemen, to launch recent offensives in the eastern provinces of Hadramawt and al-Mahra.The kingdom would take measures to confront what it considered such \"highly dangerous\" actions, it warned.The UAE's foreign ministry denied that the shipment contained weapons and expressed \"deep regret\" at the Saudi statement.It strongly condemned \"the allegations that it exerted pressure on, or directed, any Yemeni party to carry out military operations that would undermine the security of the sisterly kingdom of Saudi Arabia or target its borders\".The STC's leaders also said the ultimatum for the withdrawal of the UAE's forces had no legal basis, and insisted it would remain a \"main partner\" in the battle against the Iran-backed Houthi movement, which controls much of north-western Yemen.Earlier on Monday, the head of the eight-member presidential council - which includes STC representatives - announced that he was cancelling a joint defence pact with the UAE and ordering its forces to leave \"in the interest of safeguarding the security of all citizens, affirming commitment to Yemen's unity, sovereignty, stability, and territorial integrity\".Rashad al-Alimi also declared a state of emergency for a period of 90 days, which he said was necessary to confront the Houthis and what he described as \"the internal strife led by mutinous military elements that received orders from the United Arab Emirates\".Alimi's announcement came after the spokesman of the Saudi-led coalition - which includes the UAE - said it had carried out a \"limited\" air strike on weapons and military vehicles for the STC's forces in the southern Yemeni port of Mukalla which arrived on two ships from the UAE.The shipments had constituted \"an imminent threat and an escalation that threatens peace and stability\", Maj-Gen Turki al-Maliki asserted.An official at the port told AFP news agency that a warning to evacuate was received at 04:00 local time (01:00 GMT) and that an open area at the facility was struck about 15 minutes later.Pictures of the aftermath showed a number of burned out military vehicles and pick-up trucks parked in a walled-off area at the port, as well as damage to a nearby building. No casualties were reported.The UAE's foreign ministry said it had been surprised by the strike on Mukalla and that the coalition statement had been issued without consultation with member states.It insisted that the shipment in question \"did not include any weapons, and that the vehicles unloaded were not intended for any Yemeni party but were shipped for use by Emirati forces operating in Yemen\".On Saturday, the Saudi-led coalition called on the STC's forces to withdraw \"peacefully\" from Hadramawt and al-Mahra, a day after the Saudi air force reportedly bombed positions held by the separatists in the Wadi Nahab area of Hadramawt.The STC's forces launched offensives in the two provinces amid rising tensions earlier this month, putting in direct conflict with government forces.It said the operations were necessary to \"restore stability\" in the south and to combat the Houthis, as well as the jihadist groups al-Qaeda and Islamic State (IS).Yemen has been devastated by a civil war that began in 2014, when the Houthis ousted the internationally recognised government from the capital Sanaa. The conflict escalated in 2015, after the Saudi-led coalition of Arab states intervened to restore the government's rule.The fighting has reportedly left more than 150,000 people dead and triggered one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.At the start of the war, the STC and other separatists seeking independence for south Yemen, which was a separate country before unification with the north in 1990, formed an uneasy alliance with the government to stop the Houthis capturing the southern city of Aden.However, in recent years the STC and its allies have turned on the government and seized control of Aden and much of the south of the country.",

    "body": "2 hours agoKelly NgandJake Kwon,Seoul correspondentWatch: 'Trusting time' - NewJeans discusses court ruling in record label disputeChart-topping K-pop band NewJeans' record label, Ador, is suing one of the band's members in what is yet another twist in their bitter year-long feud.Hybe, the record label's parent company, confirmed to the BBC that it is suing Danielle Marsh, one of her family members, and ex-boss Min Hee-jin for $30m (£22m) in damages and as part of a contract break penalty.The band has been plunged into further turmoil as the return of Minji, another of its stars, remains uncertain, leaving the band with three members.Coming less than two months after reports that NewJeans would return to the label as a band of five, this news dashes fans' hopes of a comeback.Many took to social media with the slogan: \"NewJeans is five or nothing, while others questioned why Danielle was singled out.\"Does this make any sense??? NewJeans without Danielle isn't NewJeans. Do you think you can just erase a member this easily? Give us back Danielle,\" one wrote in an X post.\"It's not fair at all. Free NewJeans [all 5 members],\" another wrote on Instagram. \"All they wanted to do was to be [artists] and make their fans happy.\"NewJeans, which became the eighth biggest-selling act in the world a year after their debut in 2022, were seen as a game-changer by critics for their blend of 1990s R&B and sugar-coated pop melodies. Then came a dramatic fallout with the record label Ador in 2024, sparked by the controversial dismissal of the agency's former CEO Min Hee-jin, whom NewJeans regarded as a mentor.The move shook the K-pop world, setting off a battle between hugely successful and very young stars - they are between 17 and 21 years of age - and the South Korean entertainment giant, Hybe.NewJeans accused Ador of \"mistreatment\" and \"deliberate miscommunications and manipulation\", then announced they would leave the agency. Ador in turn launched a lawsuit blocking their departure, which it won in October this year. A district court ruled that NewJeans must honour their contract with the label which runs until 2029.A month later, local media reports indicated that all five members would return to the agency.Getty ImagesNewJeans have delivered remarkable success since they debuted in July 2022Then in a surprising turn, Ador issued a statement on Monday, saying it had terminated its contract with Danielle and would take legal action against a family member of hers and Min, who founded the label and created NewJeans before her dramatic departure. Both of them, Ador claims, \"bear significant responsibility\" for the fallout between the agency and the K-pop group. Monday's statement did not mention a lawsuit against Danielle, saying only that Ador had decided it was difficult to continue working with her, and told her they would be ending the contract.   Ador also claimed that NewJeans' members had been \"exposed to persistently distorted and biased information\" which led to \"significant misunderstandings\" about the label.That statement named two other NewJeans members: Hanni, who it said decided to remain with the label after \"extended conversations\" which included her family, and Minji, who is still in \"ongoing conversations\" with the agency.It's been a whirlwind for fans, especially since Ador initially announced in November that only two members, Hyein and Haerin, would return to the agency, sparking fears the group would split up.These fears were allayed when Hanni, Danielle and Minji said in a separate statement hours later that they too would return - but only for a short time, as it turns out. Getty ImagesAdor announced on Monday would terminate its contract with NewJeans member Danielle Marsh\"NewJeans is a very important group that changed the world of female K-pop acts. For the music listeners and fans, it has been the hope to see their return as a full five-member team. That's no longer possible,\" music critic Lim Hee-yun told the BBC, adding that this outcome would not \"make anyone happy\".Mr Lim believes Ador would be pressured to recruit new members into the group, especially if Minji also leaves the label.It is hard for three-member groups to find success in the K-pop industry, where fans pay close attention to the relationships and chemistry between members.Danielle's future as a musician is also uncertain.\"Not only will there be a large part of the public that see her negatively [because of this controversy], but the record labels will too... She might need to pursue being a solo act as an actor, model, or an influencer,\" Mr Lim said.Additional reporting by Leehyun Choi and Hosu Lee in Seoul",

    "body": "21 hours agoBen MilneandJames Percy,BBC NewsBBCThe first non-European Pope in more than 1,000 years, the Oscar-winning star of Annie Hall and The Godfather, a soul legend and one of the world's most famous designers - here are some of the well-known faces no longer with us.Among those we remember are Hollywood stars Robert Redford, Diane Keaton and Gene Hackman, and theatrical dames Joan Plowright and Patricia Routledge.Robert RedfordGetty ImagesRobert Redford's acting career spanned more than 50 films and won him an Oscar as a director. For many filmgoers though, he was simply the best-looking cinema star in the world - once described as \"a chunk of Mount Rushmore levered into stonewashed denims\". As well as leading roles in hits such as All The President's Men, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Way We Were, Redford also launched the Sundance Film Festival to champion independent filmmakers.Read moreDiane KeatonGetty ImagesLos-Angeles-born Keaton shot to fame with her role in The Godfather, but enjoyed a long creative partnership with Woody Allen. Annie Hall, a comedy based on their off-screen relationship, earned her a Best Actress Oscar and they collaborated on several other films. She was nominated for three further Oscars - all in the best actress category - for her work in Something's Gotta Give, Marvin's Room and Reds.Read morePrunella ScalesGetty Images\"BASIL!\" - the unmistakable sound of Sybil Fawlty admonishing her pompous and incompetent husband, is probably how Prunella Scales will best be remembered.  Apart from starring in sitcom Fawlty Towers, she played many other roles on screen and stage, including Queen Elizabeth II in Alan Bennett's play, A Question of Attribution. She also enjoyed an unlikely hit late in life with Channel 4's Great Canal Journeys, travelling waterways in the UK and elsewhere with her husband, the actor Timothy West.Read moreDavid LynchGetty ImagesPerhaps the most avant-garde filmmaker ever to make it big in Hollywood, David Lynch brought surrealism to the big screen in films including Mulholland Drive and Blue Velvet. However, his groundbreaking TV series Twin Peaks remained for many his greatest work - portraying an idyllic American small town encroached by a chaotic unconscious world.Read moreMalcolm-Jamal WarnerGetty ImagesBest known for his role as Theo Huxtable on The Cosby Show, Malcolm-Jamal Warner starred in the hugely popular US sitcom from 1984-1992. He had been handpicked for his breakout role on the final day of a nationwide audition - \"I was literally the last person they saw,\" he recalled in a 2023 interview. More recently, Warner appeared in several television programmes including Malcom & Eddie, and The Resident.Read moreGene HackmanGetty ImagesAs New York cop Popeye Doyle in the 1971 film The French Connection, Gene Hackman's cemented his reputation as one of Hollywood's great tough guys. That role won him his first acting Oscar (the second was for the 1992 Western, Unforgiven). Hackman also showed a gift for comedy in The Royal Tennenbaums and Young Frankenstein, among others.Read moreDharmendraGetty ImagesDubbed the \"original He-Man of Bollywood\", Dharmendra was one of India's most famous film stars, with a career that spanned seven decades and more than 300 films. He could turn his hand to romance, action roles or comedy. One of his most popular films was the 1975 blockbuster, Sholay, where he played a petty criminal hired by the police to capture a villain. Dharmendra always said he was \"embarrassed\" by talk of his good looks and attributed it to \"nature, my parents and my genes\".Read moreDame Joan PlowrightGetty ImagesBorn in Lincolnshire, Joan Plowright became a leading lady in London's West End in the 1950s. She appeared opposite Sir Laurence Olivier - the man she later married - in John Osborne's The Entertainer at the Royal Court in 1957. Her career lasted more than 60 years, earning her awards for both stage and screen roles. In 2004, she was made a Dame of the British Empire.Read moreVal KilmerGetty Images\"The most unsung leading man of his generation,\" according to one movie critic, Val Kilmer starred as Tom Cruise's rival in Top Gun, Jim Morrison in The Doors and (less happily) Batman, taking over the role from Michael Keaton. In the early 2000s, the starring roles dried up, and in 2014, Kilmer was diagnosed with throat cancer. Chemotherapy and radiation left him with a tube in his trachea and difficulty breathing - something that was written into his final role, reprising his \"Iceman\" character in the 2022 Top Gun sequel.Read moreTerence StampGetty ImagesA stalwart of swinging London in the 1960s, Terence Stamp became famous for a string of films including Billy Budd, Modesty Blaise and Far From The Madding Crowd - as well as dating icons of that decade, Julie Christie and Jean Shrimpton. In the 1970s he took a break from acting, before returning as Superman villain General Zod, and later starring as a transgender woman Bernadette Bassenger in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.Read moreBrigitte BardotGetty ImagesFrench actress who swept away cinema's staid 1950s' portrayal of women and personified a new age of sexual liberation. On screen, Brigitte Bardot was a cocktail of kittenish charm and continental sensuality, but it was an image she grew to loathe - eventually abandoning her career to campaign for animal welfare. Later, Bardot's reputation was damaged after she made homophobic slurs and was fined multiple times for inciting racial hatred.Read moreClaudia CardinaleGetty ImagesTunisian-born, Claudia Cardinale had a six-decade-long career, rising to fame during the golden age of Italian cinema. She shot to fame in 1963 when she appeared in Federico Fellini's Oscar-winning 8 1/2 and Luchino Visconti's epic period drama The Leopard. She also worked in Hollywood in the 1960s, starring in The Pink Panther, where co-star David Niven paid her the best compliment she said she ever received: \"Claudia, along with spaghetti, you're Italy's greatest invention.\"Read moreDame Patricia RoutledgeDame Patricia Routledge was best known as Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced \"Bouquet\") in the BBC sitcom Keeping Up Appearances. \"She's an absolute monster and I enjoyed playing her enormously,\" said the actress. Other comic roles included her monologues as Kitty in Victoria Wood: As Seen On TV (\"I could've married, I've given gallons of blood and I can't stomach whelks, so that's me for you\"). Success in TV followed a long career on stage, both in the West End and on Broadway.Read moreGraham GreeneGetty ImagesCanadian actor Graham Greene is best remembered for his role as Kicking Bird in the 1990 Western, Dances With Wolves. It was a part for which he received an Oscar nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category. In real life, Greene was a member of the Oneida Nation, part of the Six Nations Reserve in southern Ontario. Greene had several jobs, including draftsman and steelworker, before becoming an actor in the 1970s. Other films he appeared in included The Green Mile, Die Hard With A Vengeance and Maverick.Read morePauline CollinsGetty ImagesAs Shirley Valentine, the frustrated Liverpool housewife who finds romance on a Greek island, Pauline Collins achieved international fame and an Oscar nomination.

The Glaswegian comic actor specialised in parodies of television and Hollywood films, where he played most of the parts. He also appeared in the ITV children's show Mr Majeika before retiring from television in 1990, but he continued to appear as a panto dame in Scotland for several more years.Read moreRob ReinerGetty ImagesOne of Hollywood's best known filmmakers, responsible for a string of much-loved films across a range of genres. Reiner's work encompassed the classic comedies This Is Spinal Tap and When Harry Met Sally, the courtroom drama A Few Good Men, and the tense thriller Misery.

After the 9/11 attacks, Dick Cheney was one of the main driving forces behind the \"war on terror\" that followed, and central to the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. Although known as a drier-than-dry conservative, he was a bitter critic of President Donald Trump, arguing in 2024 that there had \"never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic\".Read moreLord Norman TebbitGetty ImagesAs one of Margaret Thatcher's closest political allies, Norman Tebbit revelled in his combative reputation (he was once described as \"a semi-house-trained polecat\" by a Labour opponent). He also gave the 1980s one of its most memorable political soundbites when he described how his father \"got on his bike to look for work\".He left the Conservative Cabinet in 1987 to care for his wife, who had been left disabled by the Brighton bomb attack three years earlier.Read moreBaroness Jenny RandersonPA MediaLiberal Democrat politician Jenny Randerson became the first female Liberal Democrat minister anywhere, when she was appointed Wales's Minister for Culture, Sport and the Welsh Language in 2000.

In 1972 he founded the Front National, a party committed to stopping immigration. Le Pen's attempts to win the presidency foundered, although he finished runner-up in 2002.

In the 2000s, he became one of the first stars of reality TV in The Osbournes, charting the everyday life of a rock superstar and his family.Read moreJimmy CliffGetty ImagesOne of the first stars of reggae music, Jimmy Cliff brought the sound of Jamaica to a global audience with hits such as Many Rivers To Cross, Beautiful People and You Can Get It If You Really Want.

Their first (self-titled) LP was later named the greatest British album of all time by the Observer and the NME. It combined influences from rock, dance and funk, all underpinned by Mani's basslines. After the group disbanded in 1996, he joined Scottish rock band Primal Scream.Read moreRoberta FlackGetty ImagesSoul singer Roberta Flack trained as a classical pianist.

Sadly, Stone's career stalled in the mid-1970s as a result of drug abuse, and at one point he was reported to have been left homeless.Read moreBrian WilsonGetty ImagesFounder member of the Beach Boys, Brian Wilson was one of pop music's greatest composers. The group's early songs, such as California Girls and I Get Around painted a picture of US west-coast surfers living the good life, while the 1966 LP, Pet Sounds, showcased Wilson's genius for complex melodies and intricate harmonies. Fragile mental health led to his withdrawal from the Beach Boys in the 1970s, but he overcame his demons to perform again late in life.Read moreD'AngeloGetty ImagesSinger who pioneered neo-soul, a genre blending R&B with other types of music, including hip-hop and jazz, D'Angelo rose to fame in the 1990s with his debut album Brown Sugar.

From his election onwards, he turned down many privileges traditionally accorded to the Pope. His early actions in the office included washing the feet of the elderly and prisoners and advocating for the rights of refugees and migrants.Francis's papacy heralded several reforms to the Catholic Church, but on many of its teachings, he was a traditionalist. He was at times supportive of some kind of same-sex unions for gay couples, but did not favour calling it marriage. He also took part in an anti-abortion march in Rome - calling for rights of the unborn \"from the moment of conception\".He died on Easter Monday, less than 24 hours after his last public appearance, in front of a crowd of worshippers at St Peter's Square in the Vatican.Read moreGiorgio ArmaniGetty ImagesItalian fashion designer who revolutionised the look of men's and women's suits in the 1960s, introducing softer styles for menswear and power suits for women - \"I realised that they needed a way to dress that was equivalent to that of men,\" he said.

    "body": "9 hours agoCaroline HawleyDiplomatic CorrespondentTelegramFootage shared on social media showed protesters breaking the gate of the governor's office in FasaProtesters in Iran have tried to break into a local government building in the southern province of Fars, on a fourth day of demonstrations sparked by a currency collapse.Officials said three police officers were injured and four people arrested in the city of Fasa.Confrontations were also been reported in the western provinces of Hamedan and Lorestan.The authorities in the capital, Tehran, had declared Wednesday a bank holiday - in an apparent effort to quell the unrest.In video that emerged on social media and was verified by the BBC, a crowd is filmed breaking the gate of the governor's office in Fasa.Then, in another post, security men are seen shooting in response. Clouds of tear gas rise in front of shuttered shops.Across the country, schools, universities and public institutions were closed because of the last-minute public holiday announced by the Iranian government.It was ostensibly to save energy because of the cold weather, though it was seen by many Iranians as an attempt to contain the protests.They began in Tehran on Sunday - among shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and they had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who was accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly. But they have not been on the same scale.To prevent any escalation, tight security is now reported in the areas of Tehran where the demonstrations began.President Masoud Pezeshkian has said his government will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.But the prosecutor general, Mohammad Movahedi-Azad, has also warned that any attempt to create instability would be met with what he called a \"decisive response\".",

    "body": "Three hikers, including a 19-year-old who fell approximately 500 feet (150m), have been found dead on Mt Baldy, a looming snow-capped mountain known to be one of the most dangerous to climb in Southern California.Rescue workers found Marcus Alexander Muench Casanova, 19, dead and discovered two other dead hikers during the search, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department.The other two hikers were not hiking with the teenager, and it is not clear how long they had been deceased on the mountain.Casanova went hiking on 29 December with a friend who was able to call for help after the teen fell. The friend had to hike away from the fall site near the Devil's Backbone trail to an area with cell reception and provided their GPS location to rescue crews, authorities said. That companion was unharmed.Due to high winds, emergency crews were unable to complete a recovery operation by helicopter on Monday, but were able to recover the bodies on Tuesday.The sheriff's office said it had rescued five other hikers from the mountain in the previous five days.\"We are destroyed by the loss of our beloved Marcus,\" his family said in a statement on Wednesday. The statement described the California native as an \"avid sailor and outdoorsman\".Rising 10,064 feet (3068m) in the San Gabriel Mountains, Mt Baldy – officially known as Mt San Antonio – has become one of the deadliest peaks in the United States.More than 14 people have died on the mountain since 2020, including British actor Julian Sands in January 2023, although his remains were not found until five months later. More than 100 people have been rescued from the mountain since 2020.Proximity to Los Angeles means Mt Baldy attracts experienced and inexperienced climbers, and authorities urged people to stay off the mountain, especially during such unpredictable winter weather.\"It is one of the most dangerous trails we have here in our area,\" Jenny Smith, a spokesperson for the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, said of the Devil's Backbone trail during a news conference. \"We don't want novice hikers going up and hurting themselves.\"Southern California has been blanketed in rain and snow over the last week, but on 29 December, when the teen went hiking, the sun was shining, and the skies were blue with unusually clear visibility across the region.Mt Baldy was visible across Southern California, with breathtaking views from as far away as Catalina Island.The weather can change quickly on Mt Baldy, and conditions can be treacherous with snow and ice. Climbers venturing along the Devil's Backbone trail are advised to carry crampons and ice axes.Trails on the mountain have been temporarily closed until the new year following the deaths and the repeated rescue responses.",

    "body": "Finnish police have detained a vessel sailing from Russia, which is suspected of damaging an undersea telecoms cable running from Helsinki to Estonia across the Gulf of Finland.The cargo vessel, the Fitburg, was sailing from St Petersburg to the port of Haifa in Israel, under the flag of St Vincent and Grenadines.All 14 crew members were arrested after the cable owned by Finnish telecoms operator Elisa was damaged. The operator said in a statement that the damage had \"not affected the functionality of Elisa's services in any way\", and its services had been re-routed.The Baltic Sea has seen a series of incidents in recent years in which underwater cables have been damaged or completely cut.Many experts and political leaders have viewed the recent incidents as part of a \"hybrid war\" carried out by Russia against Western countries. The issue has come under increased focus since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Police said they were investigating \"aggravated disruption of telecommunications\" and \"aggravated sabotage and attempted aggravated sabotage\".The detained crew members were Russian, Georgian, Kazakh and Azerbaijani, police added.Undersea cables carry crucial electricity and data between countries, and keep people connected to the internet.On Wednesday morning, the Finnish authorities sent a helicopter and a patrol ship to the area, where they found the vessel was dragging its anchor in the sea, Finland's coastguard said.They said they had \"launched operations this morning to investigate the suspected cable damage\" after telecoms provider Elisa detected a fault.Finnish police said the authorities had \"taken control of the vessel as part of a joint operation\".\"At this stage, the police are investigating the incident as aggravated criminal damage, attempted aggravated criminal damage, and aggravated interference with telecommunications,\" the police added.\"Finland is prepared for security challenges of various kinds, and we respond to them as necessary,\" Finnish President Alexander Stubb said in a statement on social media. At a press conference, police were asked by journalists if the cable was damaged on behalf of another country, local media reported.Police Chief Ilkka Koskimäki replied that \"the police or other authorities do not speculate on these matters. The police's job is to investigate what happened.\"Eight Nato countries, and Russia, border the Baltic Sea - Finland, Estonia, Denmark, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden.Estonia's government said a second telecoms cable connecting it to Finland also suffered an outage on Wednesday. The country's President Alar Karis said \"hopefully it was not a deliberate act, but the investigation will clarify\".The European Commission was closely monitoring the incident, EU technology commissioner Henna Virkkunen posted on X, adding that it was prepared to counter \"hybrid threats\".\"We're already talking about national security. Critical infrastructure is the front line,\" the Finnish MP Jarno Limnell commented on the incident, in a post on X.Nato has identified deep-sea cables as part of the world's critical infrastructure and previously warned that adversaries could exploit them through sabotage or hybrid warfare, threatening both civilian and military communications.\"Hybrid warfare\" includes underwater sabotage, anonymous cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns, and non-military tactics to destabilise adversaries.In December 2024, Finnish police said they were investigating whether a Russian ship was involved in the sabotage of an electricity cable running between Finland and Estonia.A month earlier, the German government said damage to two undersea cables in the Baltic Sea looked like an act of sabotage. A cable between Finland and Germany was cut, as well as another cable between Lithuania and Sweden's Gotland Island. ",

    "body": "20 hours agoKayla EpsteinGetty ImagesTatiana Schlossberg, the granddaughter of former US President John F Kennedy, has died aged 35.Her family announced her death in a social media post shared by the John F Kennedy Library Foundation, writing: \"Our beautiful Tatiana passed away this morning. She will always be in our hearts.\"In November, Schlossberg, a climate journalist, announced her diagnosis of an aggressive form of cancer. She said in an essay that she had been given less than a year to live.Schlossberg was the daughter of designer Edwin Schlossberg and diplomat Caroline Kennedy, and is survived by her husband George Moran and their two children, three-year-old Edwin and one-year-old Josephine.In an article published last month in The New Yorker titled, \"A Battle With My Blood,\" Schlossberg revealed she had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia in May 2024, after giving birth to her second child.\"My first thought was that my kids, whose faces live permanently on the inside of my eyelids, wouldn't remember me,\" she wrote.Schlossberg described the treatments she received, including chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant, but shared that doctors did not give her a good prognosis.She also wrote of the pain she feared her passing would cause for her family, which has endured multiple personal tragedies. Her grandfather, President Kennedy, was assassinated in 1963 and her uncle, John F Kennedy Jr, died in a plane crash in 1999. Her younger brother, Jack Schlossberg, is running for Congress in New York.\"For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry,\" Schlossberg wrote.\"Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life, and there's nothing I can do to stop it,\" she said.In her essay, Schlossberg also expressed disappointment in her relative Robert F Kennedy Jr's appointment to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Another relative, Maria Shriver, a journalist and the former first lady of California, paid tribute to her \"sweet, beloved Tatiana\" as someone who \"loved her life\".\"She created a beautiful life with her extraordinary husband George, and children Eddie and Josie. She fought like a warrior. She was valiant, strong, courageous.\"\"Tatiana was a great journalist, and she used her words to educate others about the earth and how to save it\", Shriver wrote on Instagram.AFP via Getty ImagesPrince William, Jack Schlossberg, Tatiana Schlossberg and Caroline Kennedy pictured in 2022 at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in BostonBefore her widely-read essay about her diagnosis, Schlossberg forged a successful career as a climate journalist.Schlossberg authored the book \"Inconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Don't Know You Have\". She also wrote about climate and other beats for the New York Times.In December 2021, she reported on local experiments to harness the energy of the London Underground to provide heat to homes, in an effort to fight climate change.\"I think climate change is the biggest story in the world, and it's a story about everything,\" she told NBC News in 2019. \"It's about science and nature, but it's also about politics and health and business. To me, looking at this as a journalist, it seemed like a really important story to tell.\"\"And if I could help communicate about it, that might inspire other people to get involved and work on the issue,\" she said.",

Mr Honkoop said the table in front of him broke in two. Shattered glass littered the floor of the carriage, and many were lying wounded in the aisle. One woman he saw was trapped \"between a bench and a table\". He tried to assist by moving luggage and handing out painkillers, as, by coincidence, \"I'd had a wisdom tooth removed recently so I had lots of painkillers on me\".AFP via Getty ImagesThe UK Foreign Office said it was \"supporting a number of British nationals involved\" in the crash, while the US embassy in Peru said that US citizens were injured. After the crash, Mr Honkoop said another train arrived with medical assistance. He and his tour group were taken to a nearby village where they were given food and medical care and taken to a hotel. The collision occurred on the track linking Ollantaytambo Station and Aguas Calientes, the closest town to Machu Picchu. The journey between the two stations usually takes around 90 minutes.The two trains involved were operated by PeruRail and Inca Rail respectively.Niels HonkoopNiels Honkoop (right) described the accident as \"chaos\"\"We deeply regret what has happened,\" PeruRail said in a statement, adding that its staff had \"immediately\" provided first aid to the train driver, the train conductor and the passengers involved in the incident.The cause of the accident has not yet been made clear.It comes amid an ongoing dispute between providers of transport to the Unesco world heritage site, with local communities unhappy with what they say is an insufficiently open bidding process.The trains and buses that take tourists to the ancient town have steep ticket prices and can be highly lucrative for operators due to its limited accessibility.Built in the Peruvian Andes in the 15th Century, the Incan city of Machu Picchu is one of the Seven Modern Wonders of the World.Visitors can take a series of trains and buses to reach the site, or hike along the Inca trail with a registered tour operator.In 2011, officials implemented a daily cap on visitors to protect and preserve the site, but concerns remain about over-tourism.Watch: Injured passengers helped from train after collision near Machu PicchuMore on this story",

The incident took place at the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular! during a live recreation of a famous scene from the film.Video shows the boulder rolling towards the audience as a staff member jumps into its path, preventing it from reaching the crowd.\"We're focused on supporting our cast member, who is recovering,\" Disney said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Safety is at the heart of what we do, and that element of the show will be modified as our safety team completes a review of what happened.\"The scene from 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark shows Indiana Jones - played by Harrison Ford - outrunning a giant boulder triggered by a booby trap, before leaping to safety.Video of the incident on Tuesday shows the boulder bouncing off its tracks, and then bounding towards the audience as a staff member steps into its path and is knocked to the ground.The staff member did not appear to stand up immediately, and other workers are seen running to his side.According to a blog run by the park, the boulder prop is approximately 400-lbs and made of rubber. A spokesperson for Disney did not confirm that the boulder was the cause of the incident, but told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that \"a prop moved off its track\".One witness told People magazine that the worker had \"saved\" the audience from being injured. \"It was a crazy experience and definitely one that we will remember.\"In one video of the incident, a man behind the camera is heard saying: \"He literally saved our lives, that guy.\"",

    "body": "23 hours agoKelly NgandJonathan Head,South East Asia Correspondent, BangkokThailand has released 18 Cambodian soldiers that were captured in July during deadly border clashes as part of a ceasefire the two countries agreed to on Saturday.The handover was delayed by a day over Thai concerns over alleged violations of the ceasefire, but took place after sustained Chinese diplomatic pressure to ensure the deal holds.Simmering tensions along the Thailand-Cambodia border exploded early this month and went on for weeks, forcing nearly one million people from their homes.Saturday's deal had seen both sides agree to freeze the front lines where they are now, ban reinforcements, and allow civilians living in border areas to return as soon as possible. The 18 Cambodian soldiers, dressed in civilian clothes, were greeted by well-wishers as they were escorted over a border checkpoint and handed to the Cambodian authorities. Their captivity since July - during an earlier round of deadly clashes - has inflamed nationalist sentiment in Cambodia, their release being one of the main demands of its government in the ceasefire talks with Thailand.On Wednesday, Thailand's foreign ministry said the release of the soldiers was a \"demonstration of goodwill\" and that it hoped Cambodia would \"reciprocate this goodwill through its concrete actions\".Cambodia confirmed the return of its troops, with its defence ministry saying it \"remains hopeful\" that this will help build \"mutual trust and confidence\".One of the terms of the ceasefire was that the 18 soldiers had to be handed over within 72 hours - by noon local time on Tuesday. But this was delayed after Bangkok accused Phnom Penh of violating the truce by flying more than 250 unmanned aerial vehicles into Thailand on Sunday.Despite Thailand's complaints, the latest ceasefire appears to be holding so far.Disagreement over the border dates back more than a century, but tension increased early this year after a group of Cambodian women sang patriotic songs in a disputed temple.A Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash in May. Then in July, five days of intense fighting along the border left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead. Thousands more civilians were displaced.The two countries agreed to a fragile ceasefire in July and signed it in October, brokered by US President Donald Trump. But the ceasefire collapsed when fresh tensions erupted early this month, with both sides accusing the other over the breakdown.",

It said that 20 ambulances had attended the scene and that injured people had been transferred to medical facilities in the nearby city of Cusco.The US embassy in Peru said that US citizens were injured in the crash, while the UK Foreign Office said it was \"supporting a number of British nationals involved\".Getty ImagesOne of the two trains affected in the collisionLocal media outlet Peru21 reports that hundreds of tourists remain at the scene awaiting evacuation, which has been hampered by difficult terrain around the crash site.At least 20 of the injured are in a serious condition, a health official told the Reuters news agency. The collision occurred on the track linking Ollantaytambo Station and Aguas Calientes, the closest town to Machu Picchu. The journey between the two stations usually takes around 90 minutes. The two trains involved in the accident were operated by PeruRail and Inca Rail respectively.\"We deeply regret what has happened,\" PeruRail said in a statement, adding that its staff had \"immediately\" provided first aid to the train driver, the train conductor and the passengers involved in the incident. The cause of the accident has not yet been made clear. The crash comes amid an ongoing dispute between providers of transport to the Unesco world heritage site, with local communities unhappy with what they say is an insufficiently open bidding process. The trains and buses that take tourists to the ancient town have steep ticket prices and can be highly lucrative due to its limited accessibility. Built in the Peruvian Andes in the 15th Century, the Incan city of Machu Picchu is one of the Seven Modern Wonders of the World. Visitors can take a series of trains and buses to reach the site, or hike along the Inca trail with a registered tour operator. In 2011, officials implemented a daily cap on visitors to protect and preserve the site, but concerns remain about overtourism.",

    "body": "7 hours agoNick ThorpeCentral Europe correspondentBulgaria - the poorest country in the European Union - has become the 21st member of the eurozone - leapfrogging more obvious and prosperous candidates like Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.For mostly urban, young and entrepreneurial Bulgarians, it's an optimistic and  potentially lucrative leap - the final move in a game which has brought Bulgaria into the European mainstream - from Nato and EU membership, to joining the Schengen zone, and now the euro.For the older, rural, more conservative parts of the population, the replacement of the Bulgarian lev by the euro provokes fear and resentment.The lev - meaning lion - has been the Bulgarian currency since 1881, but it has been pegged to other European currencies since 1997 - first the Deutschmark, then the euro.Opinion polls put Bulgaria's 6.5 million population more or less equally divided on the new currency, and political turmoil is not making the transition easy. Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov's coalition government lost a confidence vote on 11 December, after mass protests against the 2026 budget. Bulgaria has held seven elections in the past four years - an eighth looks likely early next year.\"I don't want the euro, and I don't like the way it has been imposed on us,\" Todor, 50, a small business owner in the central town of Gabrovo, at the foot of the Balkan mountains, told the BBC. \"If there were a referendum, I reckon 70% of the people would vote against it.\" A referendum on euro adoption was proposed by President Rumen Radev but rejected by the outgoing government. Todor's business, producing coloured plastics for the domestic market, had a bad  year because of high inflation, he said, and a fall in sales fuelled, he believed, by fear of the euro.Ognian Enev, 60, who owns a tea shop in central Sofia, was more enthusiastic. \"On the whole, it's a good thing. It's just a technical change. It doesn't bother me,\" he told the BBC. In any case, he pointed out, people who bought flats or cars until now have got used to prices marked in euros. The 1.2 million Bulgarians who live outside the country have also been sending money home for years in euros.Like many shopkeepers, Ognian has the new currency ready, in coins and small denomination notes, ready for the transition. Throughout January, you can pay in both lev and euros, but change is supposed to be in euros. From 1 February, it will no longer be permitted to pay in lev. He hopes joining the single currency will be good for trade - many of his flavoured and fruit teas come from sellers in the eurozone, while the more expensive, high-end teas are imported direct from China and Japan.Since August 2025, all shops in Bulgaria have been required by law to display prices in both currencies. Conveniently, €1 is worth about two lev (1.95583 to be exact). In response to public fears that prices will be rounded up, elaborate watchdogs have been created, to protect consumers. And some prices have been rounded down: the cost of public transport in the capital Sofia is due to fall slightly.The design on the reverse side of the new eurocoins was chosen to overcome worries that Bulgaria is losing its sovereignty. St Ivan of Rila is on the €1 coin, Paisius of Hilendar, an 18th Century monk and champion of the national revival, is on the €2 coin. The smaller denomination eurocents carry an image of the Madara rider, a symbol of early Bulgarian statehood, based on an 8th Century rock relief.Just how the new currency will impact Bulgaria as a whole, concerns everyone. The lessons from other countries offer two versions - the successful \"Baltic model\" followed by Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which combined the euro with reforms to streamline administration, encourage investment and combat corruption. And the \"Italian model\", where years of stagnation followed.\"I'm afraid we'll be more like Italy,\" Ognian Enev predicted.",

    "body": "Jailed HK tycoon's 'teeth rotting and fingernails falling off', daughter tells BBC20 hours agoDanny VincentandKoh EweAFP via Getty ImagesJimmy Lai is seen here in a 2020 photo taken months before he went to jailThe daughter of Jimmy Lai, the pro-democracy tycoon jailed in Hong Kong, has expressed concerns about her father's deteriorating health in prison, saying that his fingernails \"sometimes fall off\" and his teeth are rotting.Lai, 78, has been detained since December 2020 and faces life in prison. Earlier this month he was convicted of colluding with foreign forces under the city's controversial national security law (NSL).Hong Kong and Chinese authorities have denied that Lai has been mistreated in prison, saying he is in \"good health\".The BBC has seen a letter written by Lai's family urging UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to call for Lai's release when he meets Chinese President Xi Jinping next month.His daughter Claire Lai, who is in exile in London, told the BBC that she fears she \"may never see him again\".\"Of course I worry that my father is going to be a martyr, and I don't want him to be a martyr. But I would not be here today, I would not be speaking out if I didn't think this was his best chance of reuniting with our family.\"She described her father as an \"extremely robust and strong man\" when he went to prison, but said over the last year he has \"lost a significant amount of weight\".\"He is diabetic, he has heart issues which he never had in the past. He has fingernails that turn purplish grey and sometimes fall off. He has teeth that are rotting.\"He has back and waist pains. Some days it's painful for him to stand. Sometimes he can't stand. And some days he can't even get out of bed.\"Lai's family has, on multiple occasions, flagged concerns about his deteriorating health. Lai's son, Sebastien, told the BBC earlier this year that his father's \"body is breaking down\".A spokesperson for the Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong stated earlier this month that Lai's \"lawful rights and interests have been fully protected, and he is in good health\".They added that \"a safe, humane, appropriate, and healthy custodial environment in accordance with the law\" has been provided for Lai.Claire Lai is on a campaign to get her father released from prisonLai, a UK citizen, is the most prominent person to be charged under the NSL, introduced in 2020 in response to massive pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.Beijing defends the law as necessary to maintain stability in Hong Kong, but critics say it has effectively outlawed dissent.Lai was accused of lobbying foreign governments to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China. He was also found guilty under a separate colonial-era law of publishing seditious material in his now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper.After Lai's conviction earlier this month, the UK condemned it as \"politically motivated persecution\", saying that he had been \"targeted... for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression\".\"The UK has repeatedly called for the National Security Law to be repealed and for an end to the prosecution of all individuals charged under it,\" the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said.In their statement earlier this month, Chinese authorities said Western attempts \"to influence judicial verdicts through political pressure blatantly trample on the spirit of the rule of law and fully expose their hypocritical 'double standards'. The Chinese side firmly opposes this.\"Starmer's trip to China in late January 2026 will be the first by a UK Prime Minister since 2018.",

Five further books followed, and the TV version soon created a stir after launching in North America in late November. The show, which is adapted and directed by Jacob Tierney, is set to launch in the UK on 10 January on Sky and streaming service Now.Getty ImagesRachel Reid published her first instalment of her six-book Game Changers series in 2018Speaking to Variety, Reid said an \"amazing thing\" had come out of the attention the show has received.\"Jacob was on CNN a few weeks ago. For whatever reason, the interviewer asked him about my Parkinson's diagnosis,\" she recalled.\"I thought it was kind of odd, but then the next day, one of the top Parkinson's experts in the world reached out to me and asked if he could help me.\"Reid explained: \"I've never gotten to talk to a Parkinson's expert. I've been on a five-year waiting list here because I live in a very small place.\"Now he's found me a Parkinson's expert, a neurologist, and I have an appointment in a couple weeks. \"That could change things for me because I'm not really getting the treatment that I should be getting.\"He also told me how to change my medication so I can sleep because I never slept. That change made me sleep through the night, which really helps with writing.\"Reid said her Parkinson's made it hard for her to write \"because I can barely control a mouse\".\"I can't type for very long,\" she continued. \"It's hard for me to sit in a chair for very long. I need to figure out new ways to write.\"I don't know if that will be voice-to-text. I don't know if I can write that way. It doesn't feel natural, but I need to figure out something because it is taking me a very long time to write now.\"Heated Rivalry follows rival hockey players Shane and Ilya, played by Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie.The pair are bound by rivalry and ambition, but begin a secret affair which evolves into a years-long relationship.What is Parkinson's disease?Parkinson's is a progressive condition that worsens over time.Those with the disease have too little of the chemical dopamine in their brain because some of the nerve cells that make it have stopped working.Symptoms include:involuntary shaking of parts of the bodyslow movementstiff and inflexible musclesSource: Parkinson's UK",

    "body": "Mali and Burkina Faso say they will bar US citizens from entering their countries in response to a similar move by the Trump administration.The two West African states were recently placed under full entry restrictions under US President Donald Trump's expanded travel ban.In separate statements, they said they would apply the same measures on US nationals. Burkina Faso's foreign affairs minister Karamoko Jean-Marie Traoré said his government was acting on the \"principle of reciprocity\", while Mali's foreign ministry called for \"mutual respect and sovereign equality\". The latter said it regretted the US's move, adding that \"such an important decision was made without any prior consultation\". Mali and Burkina Faso's decision comes days after Niger's state news agency reported that Niger had imposed a similar travel ban on US citizens, though no official statement has been issued by its foreign ministry to confirm this.  The three countries are ruled by military juntas which seized power in coups. They have formed their own regional bloc, and have pivoted towards Russia after relations with other West African states and Western powers became strained.Earlier this month, the White House said that full-entry restrictions would be imposed on people from the three countries, as well as South Sudan, Syria and Palestinian Authority passport holders. The decision would come into effect on 1 January,  and was intended to \"protect the security\" of the US, it said.The administration also moved Laos and Sierra Leone, which were previously subject to partial restrictions, to the full ban list, and put partial restrictions on 15 other countries, including Nigeria, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.The White House said the restrictions would remain in place until affected countries show \"credible improvements\" in identity management, information-sharing and cooperation with US immigration authorities.A number of exceptions apply and the ban will not affect lawful permanent residents, many existing visa holders, diplomats, or athletes travelling for major sporting events. Officials said case-by-case waivers would also be available where travel is deemed to be in the national interest.",

We want people to be safe in our community,\" he added.British tourists Joe and Lucy said the increased police presence reassured them. The pair - who timed their Australia trip to coincide with the fireworks - were in Melbourne when the shooting occurred.\"We had our worries about coming for New Year's Eve,\" Joe told the BBC, adding, \"but we were reading more recently in the news... how more police were going to be here, it would be a bit safer\".Separately, Minns had urged Sydneysiders to not let the \"horrible criminal terrorist event\" at Bondi change the way they live, as he called on people to \"show defiance\" and celebrate the new year.This sentiment was shared by some of the spectators.Out among the crowds at Barangaroo's Observatory Hill, a close spot to the Sydney Harbour Bridge, was Hélène from Belgium.She told the BBC people \"cannot live in fear\" following the attack.Hours ahead of the countdown, hundreds of thousands of people flocked towards the harbour, with many official viewing areas filling to capacity by early evening.On the harbour, sailboats dotted the water - one of the best spots to watch the midnight fireworks display.Sydney's celebration - with its iconic fireworks display - kicked off a chain of events, from Dubai, to London and New York.Getty ImagesArmed police carrying assault rifles patrol outside the Sydney Opera House",

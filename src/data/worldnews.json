    "body": "6 hours agoDoug FaulknerReutersHannibal Gaddafi, now 49, pictured in 2010Hannibal Gaddafi, the youngest son of the deposed Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, has been released by Lebanon after nearly 10 years in detention without trial.The Lebanese authorities seized Mr Gaddafi, now 49, in 2015, accusing him of concealing information about the fate of a Lebanese Shia cleric who disappeared in Libya in 1978, when he was just two. Human rights groups had denounced the accusations.His lawyer told the AFP news agency his $900,000 (£682,938) bail had been paid.Laurent Bayon said: \"It's the end of a nightmare for him that lasted 10 years.\"In October, a judge set a $11m bail against Gaddafi's release but this was reduced last week after an appeal by his defence team, according to AFP.Mr Bayon said his client would leave Lebanon for a \"confidential\" destination.\"If Gaddafi was able to be arbitrarily detained in Lebanon for 10 years, it's because the justice system was not independent,\" Bayon said, according to AFP.In 2015, Mr Gaddafi was briefly abducted by an armed group in Lebanon before being freed. He was later detained by Lebanese authorities.After his father was overthrown by rebels and killed in 2011, he fled to Syria and then had lived under house arrest in Oman with his wife Aline Skaf.Before the fall of his father's regime Mr Gaddafi was known for his lavish lifestyle. The disappearance of Shia cleric Musa al-Sadr in Libya in 1978 has been a source of tension between Libya and Lebanon for decades.Hannibal Gaddafi was only two at the time and held no senior position in Libya as an adult.",

    "body": "At least 31 inmates have been found dead in a prison in southern Ecuador, including 27 who had been hanged, officials say. Four prisoners were killed and more than 30 injured in clashes between rival gang members in El Oro prison in the city of Machala in the early hours of on Sunday. Hours later, security guards who had been alerted to a fresh outbreak of gang violence found the others who had been hanged on the building's third floor, Ecuador's prison service said.The country's overcrowded prisons have been the scene of a series of deadly riots and gang fights in which hundreds of inmates have been killed in recent years. Ecuador's prison service, known by its initials as Snai, said that the clashes had been triggered by plans to move some of the inmates to a newly-built prison.El Oro prison was the site of another deadly incident in September when 13 inmates and a guard were killed in clashes between rival gangs. Relatives of the prisoners have asked the authorities to step up security inside the prison, including keeping rival gangs separate, whilst residents of Machala have long demanded that the facility, which is located in the city centre, be relocated. Earlier this year, the government of President Daniel Noboa announced the construction of a new maximum security jail in the province of Santa Elena.The new prison, named El Encuentro, is expected to open in late November, and according to the interior minister, will boast all the latest security measures. Prison gangs have for years played a key role in the rise of violent crime in Ecuador and two of them, Los Lobos and Los Choneros, were declared Foreign Terrorist Organisations by the US Department of State in September.",

    "body": "2 days agoCBSMaria Florinda Rios Perez was fatally shot after arriving at the wrong home for a house-cleaning appointment US officials are looking into whether to file charges against an Indiana homeowner who shot and killed a house cleaner who mistakenly showed up at the wrong address.Police say they found Maria Florinda Rios Perez dead in her husband's arms on the front porch of a home on Wednesday shortly before 0700 local time (12:00 GMT). Authorities had been responding to a call about a possible home invasion in the Indianapolis suburb of Whitestown. The two did not appear to have entered the home, police said in a statement. They have formally submitted the case to the Boone County Prosecutor's Office for review to determine whether criminal charges will be brought in the case. Police have not identified the people in the home or who fired the shot, saying in a statement on Friday that it is a \"complex, delicate, and evolving case, and it would be both inappropriate and potentially dangerous to disclose that information\". They urged patience, warning of a \"concerning spread of misinformation online\" about the case.Mauricio Velazquez, told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that he wanted justice for his 32-year-old wife. News reports say that she was a mother of four and originally from Guatemala. In an interview with CBS affiliate WTTV, Mr Velazquez said the bullet came right through the door of the home. \"They should've called the police first instead of just shooting out of nowhere like that,\" he said through an interpreter.CBSMauricio Velazquez said the bullet that killed his wife came through the door of the home they went to early on WednesdayBoone County prosecutor Kent Eastwood told The Indianapolis Star that the case is complex due to the language of the state's stand-your-ground law.Stand-your-ground laws are in place in many US states and most permit an individual to protect themselves with the use of reasonable force, including deadly force, to prevent death or great bodily harm.Similar incidents have made headlines across the US in recent years. In 2023, Ralph Yarl, who was then 16, was shot twice after ringing the doorbell of the wrong home in Missouri. Andrew Lester, who was in his 80s, pleaded guilty and died while awaiting sentencing. In New York, 20-year-old Kaylin Gillis died after being shot upon entering the wrong driveway. The homeowner who shot her is now serving a 25-year sentence. ",

    "body": "In the three weeks since the Louvre museum heist, as investigators sought to find out who was behind it and why the French crown jewels had been so easy to steal, another mystery remained: who the \"fedora man\" was.The dapper youth in a hat was photographed outside the museum that Sunday and went viral on social media, prompting theories about his identity.Police moved swiftly to arrest and charge four people for the crime, while the Louvre director admitted CCTV security was inadequate.However, the fedora man remained an enigma - until now.The dandy, it turns out, is a local teenage fan of Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot who just happened to be at a real crime scene.Pedro Elias Garzon Delvaux, a 15-year-old from Rambouillet, south-west of Paris told the Associated Press (AP) news agency that he had planned to visit the Louvre with his family but found the museum was closed. \"We didn't know there was a heist,\" he said.As he asked officers about the closure, an AP photographer seeking to capture the security cordon took a picture and included Pedro in the frame.Pedro only realised the photo had gone viral four days later, when a friend sent him a screenshot asking: \"Is that you?\"When he replied that it was, the friend said he had five million views on TikTok. \"I was a bit surprised,\" Pedro told the AP.He was even more shocked when his mother called to say the picture had appeared in The New York Times. It made a big impact on him, he said, because he reads that newspaper and \"it's not every day you're in the New York Times\". \"People said, 'You've become a star'. I was astonished that just with one photo you can become viral in a few days.\"Asked why he wore an old-fashioned waistcoat and a fedora to the museum, Pedro said he began dressing this way recently, inspired by 20th-century statesmen and fictional detectives.\"I like to be chic,\" he told the AP. \"I go to school like this.\"As wild speculation about the photo of him circulated online - some wondered whether he might be a real detective or an AI fake - Pedro remained silent for weeks.\"I didn't want to say immediately it was me,\" he said. \"With this photo there is a mystery, so you have to make it last.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoDoug Faulkner and Vikas Pandey,India editor, DelhiWatch: Verified video shows aftermath of car explosion in DelhiAt least eight people have been killed and more injured after a car exploded near Delhi's historic Red Fort, authorities have said.Delhi City police spokesperson, Sanjay Tyagi confirmed the deaths to the BBC, and said a further 20 people had suffered injuries.Police are investigating the cause of the explosion and \"exploring all possibilities\", Mr Tyagi said.Delhi Police Commissioner Satish Golcha has told reporters that the incident happened at around 18:52 local time (13:52 GMT), when a slow-moving vehicle stopped at a red light before it exploded, damaging nearby vehicles.Mr Tyagi told the BBC the explosion happened in a Hyundai i20 car that was moving and carrying three people at the time.Mumbai, India's financial capital, has been put on high alert, as has the Uttar Pradesh state which borders Delhi.The blast happened near a metro station close to the Red Fort, one of Delhi's most high-profile landmarks.The Mughal fortress, which is visited by thousands of tourists every day, was built in the 17th Century and is where Indian prime ministers give their Independence Day speeches every year. RAJAT GUPTA/EPA/ShutterstockIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has sent his condolences to those who lost loved ones in the blast.Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said in a statement that the news was \"extremely heartbreaking\".The federal home minister Amit Shah said teams from India's National Security Guard, and National Investigation Agency are investigating the explosion, along with forensic experts.\"We are exploring all possibilities and will conduct a thorough investigation, taking all possibilities into account. All options will be investigated immediately and we will present the results to the public,\" he added.The minister, who visited the site of the explosion and a nearby hospital, said a meeting involving senior officials would be held on Tuesday morning.Security is being stepped up at \"sensitive religious sites, vulnerable districts and border areas\" in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, according to senior police official Amitabh Yash following the blast in neighbouring Delhi.Uttar Pradesh is home to famous sites such as the Taj Mahal and is a densely populated state.REUTERS/StringerAt least eight people died and 20 more were injured when the Hyundai i20 exploded, authorities saidVeeru Sindhi, a local businessman at the site when the explosion happened, described scenes of devastation, with multiple bodies and vehicles engulfed in flames.\"I am fully shaken by what I have seen,\" he told the BBC. \"We tried to rescue people who were trapped inside the vehicles.\"One eyewitness described the aftermath of the blast as chaotic and confusing.He was just a few hundred metres away from the spot when he heard a loud explosion.\"It felt like everything stopped for a few seconds before everyone started running in all directions,\" he told the BBC.He did not go near the site but could see mangled car parts on fire and locals trying to help the injured.There has been a heavy security presence at the blast site with personnel from the Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS), the National Security Guard (NSG), and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). Armed officers have been seen moving towards the area as investigations continue.Additional reporting by Charlotte Scarr and Dilnawaz Pasha.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jr at the White House & Raffi BergWatch: 'If you didn't have a rough past, you wouldn't have a chance', says Trump on al-SharaaSyria will join the international coalition to combat the Islamic State group, marking a shift in US foreign policy in the Middle East, a senior Trump administration official has confirmed. The announcement came as President Donald Trump met Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa at the White House - the first such visit from a Syrian leader in the country's history.In an interview with Fox News, al-Sharaa said the visit was part of a \"new era\" in which the country would co-operate with the US. Trump has expressed his support for al-Sharaa, who until recently was designated a terrorist by the US government.Syria will now be the 90th country to join the global coalition, which is aimed at eliminating remaining elements of the so-called Islamic State and stemming the flow of foreign militants to the Middle East. Following the meeting, a senior administration official also confirmed that the US Treasury Department, along with the departments of state and commerce, will announce new measures to lift economic restrictions on Syria and provide \"compliance clarity for investors\".As part of the measures, the administration is also issuing an 180-day suspension of the Caesar Act, which since 2019 had sanctioned the former Syrian government.Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office several hours after the meeting, Trump said that \"we want to see Syria become a country that's very successful.\" \"And I think this leader can do it,\" he added. \"I really do.\" Diplomatic relations between Syria and the US have been suspended since 2012, although the US will now allow Syria to re-open its embassy in Washington. This is the third meeting between the two leaders, following one in May on the sidelines of the Gulf Cooperation Council and a dinner during the UN General Assembly in September. Al-Sharaa's visit to the White House caps a remarkable re-branding for the former jihadist. Not long ago, he led a branch of Al-Qaeda - the group behind the 9/11 attacks and many others - before breaking off ties. Even until this year, he was the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an armed Islamist group which the US officially considered a terrorist organisation until four months ago, with a $10m bounty on his head. The Treasury Department removed al-Sharaa from its \"specially designated global terrorist list\" just last week.But since becoming interim Syrian president, al-Sharaa has worked to soften his public image as he tries to rebuild Syria, with foreign support, following 13 years of war. \"He has had a rough past,\" Trump said on Monday. \"And I think, frankly, if you didn't have a rough past, you wouldn't have a chance.\" In his interview, al-Sharaa said that he and Trump had not discussed his past, but instead focused on the \"present and the future\" of Syria in which it was a \"geopolitical\" and economic partner of Washington. Al-Sharaa's rule, however, has been marred by killings of members of Syria's Alawite minority, as well as by deadly violence between Sunni Bedouin fighters and Druze militias.He has vowed to root out members of his security forces that have committed human rights violations. Trump, for his part, has repeatedly expressed support for al-Sharaa, referring to him as a \"young, attractive guy\" and a \"fighter\". In June, President Trump signed an executive order lifting sanctions against Syria, which the White House said would help support the country's \"path to stability and peace\". At the time, the administration said it would monitor the new Syrian government's actions, including \"taking steps toward normalising ties with Israel\" and addressing \"foreign terrorists\" and militant groups operating in the country.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced earlier in the week that it would be reducing air travel capacity by up to10% at 40 of the nation's busiest airports as air traffic controllers, who are working without pay during the shutdown,  report fatigue.Republicans and Democrats remain divided over how to end the impasse in Congress. Saturday marked the 39th day of the longest shutdown in history. Senators are in Washington over the weekend for bipartisan negotitations aimed at resolving the deadlock. Republicans have rejected an offer by Democrats to pass the current funding bill, in exchange for a one-year extension to health care subsidies.The shutdown is beginning to be felt by more and more Americans amid cuts to food aid payments and the flight disruptions. In a statement on Saturday, American Airlines urged party leaders \"to reach an immediate resolution to end the shutdown\".New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport was experiencing some of the longest wait times. As of Saturday afternoon, arrivals to the airport were delayed by an average of more than four hours, while departures from the airport were delayed by an average of 90 minutes, according to the FAA. The airports with the most cancelled flights on Saturday, both to and from the location, were Charlotte/Douglas International, Newark Liberty International, and Chicago O'Hare International, according to FlightAware. Flights to John F Kennedy and LaGuardia airports in New York were delayed by nearly three hours and an hour respectively, the FAA reported on Saturday afternoon. Other airports affected by lengthy delays inncluded Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International. With the Thanksgiving holiday approaching on 27 November, it's one of the busiest travel seasons of the year in the US. It's not just commercial flights that have been affected. Restrictions on private jets are also in place, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a Saturday post on X.  \"We've reduced their volume at high traffic airports - instead having private jets utilise smaller airports or airfields so busy controllers can focus on commercial aviation,\" Duffy wrote. \"That's only fair.\"And things are likely to get worse in the coming days as the FAA cancels more flights. On Thursday, the agency announced that the flight reductions would be gradual, starting at 4% of  flights on Friday before rising to 6% by 11 November, 8% by 13 November, and the full 10% by 14 November.The FAA said the cuts were necessary to maintain safety as air traffic controllers have been overworked during the shutdown. As essential workers, the controllers are required to continue working without pay, and as a result, many have called in sick or taken on second jobs to afford necessities, unions say. Watch: \"Devastating\" - Airline travellers react to flight reductionsThe controllers are just some of the 1.4 million federal workers who have either been working without pay or been put on forced during the shutdown.Another factor impacting air travel is that most of the Transportation Security Agency (TSA) 64,000 agents are also not being paid while the shutdown is in place.During the last government shutdown, under the first Trump administration in 2018, it was found that up to 10% of TSA staff chose to stay at home rather than work while they weren't receiving a paycheque.",

    "body": "9 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporterCanada has lost its measles elimination status, said the Pan American Health Organization (Paho) on Monday, after failing to curb an outbreak of the virus for 12 consecutive months.Because Canada is no longer deemed measles-free, the Americas region as a whole has lost its elimination status, although individually the other countries are still considered to have stamped out the disease.The US, however, risks losing its status as well if it does not stop an ongoing outbreak by January. Related cases have now been reported in Utah, Arizona and South Carolina.Canada's outbreak began last October, with health officials attributing it to fewer people being vaccinated against measles.At a news conference on Monday, Paho officials appealed to Canadian governments and the public to ramp up vaccinations, noting that 95% of the population needs to be immunised to stop the spread of measles.\"This loss represents a setback, but it is also reversible,\" said Dr Jarbas Barbosa, the health organisation's director.How Canada became the centre of a measles outbreak in North AmericaMore than 150 children quarantined as US measles cases hit 33-year highThe Public Health Agency of Canada said in its own statement that it is collaborating with Paho and regional health authorities to improve vaccine rates and strengthen data sharing. Prior to Monday, Canada had been declared measles-free for three decades. It can regain its elimination status if it can curb spread of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak for at least 12 months. The country has reported more than 5,000 measles cases in 2025, with most of them in the provinces of Ontario and Alberta. That is three times the 1,681 cases reported in the US, despite Canada's much smaller population. The bulk of the outbreak has been in \"under-vaccinated communities\", Canadian health officials have said. Vaccination rates in Alberta, one of the provinces hit hard by the outbreak, are lower than the 95% threshold, according to provincial data. One region, the South Zone, which includes the province's largest city of Calgary, reported only 68% of children under the age of two were immunised against measles as of 2024.The MMR vaccine is the most effective way to fight off the dangerous virus, which can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death. The jabs are 97% effective and also immunise against mumps and rubella.Canadian immunologist Dawn Bowdish told the BBC that there are many reasons behind the low vaccination rates, including lack of access to general practitioners, the absence of a national vaccination registry that Canadians could use to check their immunisation status, and the spread of misinformation. She also noted a lack of public health outreach to communities that have been hesitant or distrustful of vaccines.\"It highlights how many of our systems broke down to get us to this point,\" said Prof Bowdish of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. \"I hope that it will be a wake-up call to policymakers, and that it will be enough of a national embarrassment that we remedy some of those systemic issues,\" she addedThe Americas is the first and only region in the world to have been declared measles-free, starting in 2016. That status was then briefly lifted after outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil. The two countries regained elimination status in 2024, in part through coordinated vaccine efforts where millions were immunised. But measles has since spread again, now in North America. Along with Canada and the United States, Mexico has also seen a surge in cases and now ranks among the top 10 countries with the largest outbreaks, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

    "body": "2 days agoOttilie Mitchell and Harry SekulichUS aviation authorities have ordered that all models of a cargo plane that crashed mid-takeoff in Kentucky on Tuesday be grounded.It comes after a Boeing MD-11 aircraft operated by UPS burst into flames on the runway of Louisville International Airport before colliding into neighbouring businesses, killing 14 people. The American delivery firm had earlier said it would not operate the planes pending an ongoing investigation, with FedEx then following suit.Now the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a formal notice banning all MD-11 and MD11F aircraft from flying until safety checks are carried out.In total, 70 models are in use with UPS, FedEx and Western Global Airlines.FAA officials said the Kentucky crash happened after the plane's left engine caught fire and detached from the wing during take-off. The aircraft was carrying 38,000 gallons (144,000 litres) of fuel as it took off for a flight to Hawaii, which contributed to the size of the fire after the crash.A total of 14 people were killed in the crash and subsequent fire, including one person who had been admitted to hospital, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg has said.He said the number of dead now matches the number of people who were reported missing, indicating officials do not expect the death toll to climb further.Boeing said it welcomed the directive and that it had already advised the three firms which use the model to stop operating it out of \"an abundance of caution\".It is unclear whether the order will impact delivery services in the US, with none of the three companies reporting disruption so far.Data collated by the live air traffic website FlightRadar24 showed 55 MD-11 planes were used over the past week. \"Contingency plans are in place to flex our integrated air and ground network to help protect time-sensitive, critical shipments such as lifesaving pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and other products move through our network without disruption,\" FedEx said in a statement.UPS also said contingency plans were in place to continue its service. A statement continued: \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.\"The final passenger flights using an MD-11 was in 2014, with the model used exclusively as a cargo carrier since.The model of aircraft involved in the crash was an MD-11F triple-engine plane, which first entered service 34 years ago with Thai Airways as a passenger jet, but was transferred to UPS in 2006.MD-11s were originally manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, before the company merged with Boeing in 1997. Production of MD-11 planes ended in 2000.",

    "body": "Protesters force delay to opening of Nigeria's new art museum12 hours agoTodah OpeyemiBBC Africa, LagosXThe protesters insulted the visitors who had gone for a preview eventProtesters have targeted a new multi-million dollar museum in Nigeria and forced organisers to postpone Tuesday's planned opening.Videos showed a group insulting foreign guests and ordering them to leave after entering the grounds of the Museum of West African Art (Mowaa) in Benin City on Sunday. They were angry that the museum was not called the Benin Royal Museum and was not under the control of the Oba, the area's traditional king.With preservation and restoration facilities, Mowaa was in part conceived as a home for the Benin Bronzes - artefacts looted from there by British soldiers in the 19th Century. But a dispute over ownership has meant they are not at the museum.Following the storming of the museum, a spokesperson for the institution told the BBC they had never made any claims to the Benin Bronzes and are \"focused primarily on modern and contemporary art with a historical collections\" display from Nigeria and elsewhere in West Africa.All guests were safely escorted to secure locations, according to a statement from the museum.\"We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this situation may have caused,\" Mowaa said.No new date for the museum's opening has been announced.A resident of Edo state told the BBC the frustration stems from what many see as a hijacking of a local project. \"The Benin Oba, traditional rulers and the government of Edo are not happy about it,\" the resident added.Museum of West African Art (MOWAA), Marco Cappelletti/Marco Cappelletti StudioMowaa, designed by British-Ghanian architect David Adjaye, cost an estimated $25m (£19m) to build\"Edo\" was initially in the museum's name, but this was later dropped. Executive director Phillip Ihenacho told the BBC the backers wanted the institution to serve a wider purpose beyond Nigeria.In its statement, Mowaa said the protest \"appeared to stem from disputes between the previous and current state administrations\".The museum emphasised it was an independent, non-profit organisation and, though a former state governor had backed the project, he had no interest in it \"financial or otherwise\".Mowaa has now cancelled all preview events and advised visitors to avoid the campus until the situation is resolved.\"We are deeply grateful to all our guests - many of whom travelled long distances to be here - for their understanding, patience and resilience,\" the statement said. \"We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this situation may have caused.\"You may also be interested in:Ghana, Nigeria and the quest for UK looted treasureBenin Bronzes declaration 'blindsides' museum officialsThe art dealer, the £10m Benin Bronze and the HolocaustGetty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been released from jail, three weeks into a five-year prison term for taking part in a criminal conspiracy.He will be subject to strict judicial supervision and barred from leaving France ahead of an appeal trial due to be held next year.On 21 October, the former centre-right president, 70, was sentenced to five years for conspiring to fund his 2007 election campaign with money from late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. His legal team immediately filed a request seeking his release.Writing on social media after the release, Sarkozy said his \"energy is focused solely on the single goal of proving my innocence.\"  \"The truth will prevail... The end of the story is yet to be written.\"Sarkozy's car was seen leaving La Santé prison in Paris just before 15:00 (14:00 GMT), less than an hour-and-a-half after a court agreed to his early release. Soon after, he was seen arriving at his home in western Paris.Christophe Ingrain, one of Sarkozy's lawyers, hailed his client's release as \"a step forward\" and said they would now be preparing for the appeal trial expected in March.One condition of Sarkozy's release is he does not contact any other witnesses in the so-called \"Libyan dossier\" or any justice ministry employees. During his incarceration, he was visited by Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin. The visit prompted 30 French lawyers to file a complaint against Darmanin, highlighting what they said was a conflict of interest as Darmanin was a former colleague and friend of Sarkozy's.Speaking to a court in Paris via video link on Monday morning, Sarkozy described his time in solitary confinement as \"gruelling\" and \"a nightmare\".He said he had never had the \"mad idea\" of asking Gaddafi for money and stated he would \"never admit to something I haven't done\".Sarkozy also paid tribute to prison staff who had made his time in prison \"bearable\". \"They have shown exceptional humanity,\" he said.Sarkozy's wife, the singer and model Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, and two of the former president's sons were present in the courtroom to support him. Sarkozy is the first French ex-leader placed behind bars since World War Two Nazi collaborationist leader Philippe Pétain was jailed for treason in 1945.Since entering prison, Sarkozy has been held in a cell in the isolation wing. He had a toilet, a shower, a desk, a small electric hob and a small TV – for which he paid a monthly €14 (£12) fee – and the right to a small fridge.He also had the right to receive information from the outside world and family visits, as well as written and phone contact – but was in effect in solitary confinement. He was allowed just one hour a day for exercise, which he did by himself in the wing's segregated courtyard.Two bodyguards were stationed in nearby cells, which the interior minister Laurent Nuñez said was due to Sarkozy's status. There was \"obviously a threat against him\", Nuñez said.Sarkozy was president from 2007 to 2012. Ever since he left office, he has been dogged by criminal inquiries and for months had to wear an electronic tag around his ankle after a conviction last December for trying to bribe a magistrate for confidential information about a separate case.",

    "body": "2 days agoTiffany Wertheimer and Damian ZaneEPANicholas Oyoo (L) and Bob Njagi (R) were greeted by supporters when they arrived back in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, on SaturdayUgandan President Yoweri Museveni has for the first time acknowledged that two Kenyan activists who were missing in his country for five weeks had been arrested.Last month, eyewitnesses reported seeing Bob Njagi and Nicholas Oyoo being forced into a car by masked uniformed men after a political event where they were supporting Ugandan opposition leader Bobi Wine.News of their release was confirmed on Saturday but up to that point the authorities had denied that they were being detained.In a live interview on Saturday evening, Museveni described the two men as \"experts in riots\" who had then been put \"in the fridge for some days\".The president, who has been in power for almost four decades and is running for another term in office, was responding to a question about the recent deadly youth-led protests in neighbouring Tanzania.Museveni blamed foreign groups for stoking up trouble and said \"the ones who are doing that game here in Uganda will end up badly\".Without naming them, he added that the two Kenyan activists were released after he received calls from \"some Kenyan leaders\" who said they should be handed back. Mr Njagi and Mr Oyoo were welcomed by supporters at the main airport in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, on Saturday.\"Thirty-eight days of abduction was not easy. We didn't think that we were going to come out alive because we were being abducted by the military,\" Mr Njagi said. Kenya's Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi said their release followed \"sustained diplomatic engagement between Kenya and Uganda\".Activist organisation Vocal Africa, who had been campaigning for the two men to be freed said: \"Let this moment signal an important shift towards upholding the human rights of East Africans anywhere in East African Community\".In a joint statement, Vocal Africa, the Law Society of Kenya and Amnesty International thanked the Kenyan and Ugandan governments, as well as \"all active citizens\" who had campaigned for the release.Former pop star Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, is running against Museveni for the presidency in next year's elections.Bobi Wine accused the Ugandan government of targeting the two Kenyans for associating with him. \"If they committed any offence, why were they not produced before court and formally charged?\" he asked in a post on X on Sunday.Ugandan security agencies have often been accused of orchestrating the detention of opposition politicians and supporters while not in uniform. Some of those arrested have later resurfaced in court facing criminal charges.The latest disappearances mirror past incidents involving politicians and activists across the East African region.Last year, Njagi was picked up in Kenya by masked men during a wave of abductions believed to have been targeting government critics in the country.He surfaced a month later, after a court ordered police to produce him. He later recounted the harrowing conditions in captivity, where he said he was often isolated and denied food.Earlier this year, Kenyan activist Boniface Mwangi and his Ugandan counterpart Agather Atuhaire were detained in Tanzania and held incommunicado for days before being abandoned at their respective national borders.They later recounted being brutally mistreated, including sexual torture at the hands of the Tanzanian authorities – allegations which police dismissed as \"hearsay\".Last year, another Uganda opposition figure, Kizza Besigye, mysteriously disappeared in Nairobi only to surface four days later in a military court in Uganda, where he faces treason charges.The cases have since sparked widespread condemnation and concerns that East African governments could be collaborating to contain dissent.You may also be interested in:How a Ugandan opposition leader disappeared in Kenya and ended up in military court'We live in fear' - forced expulsions taint Kenya's safe haven imageUganda's Yoweri Museveni: How an ex-rebel has stayed in power for 35 yearsBobi Wine: Uganda's 'ghetto president'Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "2 days agoNick ThorpeBudapest, HungaryOn the surface, the Hungarian prime minister's trip was exactly what he went to Washington for: luxuriant praise and an exemption from sanctions on Russian oil, gas and nuclear supplies.And all that just five months out from a difficult election.Look closer, however, and the picture is less clear cut. The US side struck a hard trade deal - and an expensive one for Hungary. And there's no progress on Viktor Orban's biggest headache: ending the war in neighbouring Ukraine, and with it the long shadow the conflict casts over Hungary.Let's look first at Orban's key win - an exemption from US sanctions, which a White House official told the BBC was time-limited to one year, although Péter Szijjártó, Hungary's foreign minister, said would be indefinite.The time span is interesting. Trump clearly wants to help his friend win the election in April. And the exemption even partially dovetails with the European Commission demand to all member states to end the import of Russian oil, gas and nuclear fuel by the end of 2027. What is missing, from an EU perspective, is any political commitment from Orban to meet that demand - a commitment made and fulfilled by the Czech government. And the EU is trying to tighten energy sanctions - to the fury of Hungary and Slovakia.Away from the media spotlight, the Hungarian energy company MOL has been upgrading two of its refineries - Százhalombatta in Hungary and the Slovnaft facility in Bratislava - to process Brent crude instead of the high-sulphur Urals crude which flows through Russian pipelines. On Friday, MOL said 80% of its oil needs could be imported through the Adria pipeline from Croatia, albeit with higher logistical costs and technical risks. So Orban's argument, which so impressed Trump, that Hungary, as a landlocked country, has no alternative to Russian oil may not strictly be true. Overall, Hungary and Slovakia have together paid Russia $13bn (£10bn) for its oil between its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the end of 2024. The one-year window granted by the US is nevertheless a valuable respite for Hungarian households this winter. Orban told pro-government reporters who travelled with him to Washington that otherwise utility bills \"could have gone up by up to three times in December\". Capping those bills by various means has been a central plank of his popularity in Hungary since 2013. Under the US exemption, Hungary can also continue to buy Russian gas through the Turkstream pipeline, which traverses the Balkans, and pay for it in hard currency ($185m in August alone) using a Bulgarian loophole. Orban has agreed to buy LNG from the US worth $600 million, according to Bloomberg.Another key part of the Washington deal is nuclear. Hungary agreed to buy US nuclear fuel rods for its Paks 1 nuclear power station (at a cost of $114m), in parallel to those bought from Russia's Rosatom and France's Framatome.Russian plans to finance and build the nuclear extension, called Paks 2, have been long delayed by technical and licensing issues. The US agreement to lift all nuclear sanctions on Hungary may help restart that project, but thorny problems remain. Hungary has also agreed to buy US technology to extend the short-term storage of spent nuclear fuel at Paks for between $100m and $200m.Perhaps the biggest part of the deal was a Hungarian commitment to buy up to 10 small modular nuclear reactors from the US, for somewhere between $10bn and $20bn. Hungary needs electricity to power the huge Chinese battery plants being built around the country. Smaller nuclear plants are less plagued by building delays, and are easier to licence.Finally, a currency swap deal - similar to a recent US-Argentina deal to prop up the peso - under which US and Hungarian central banks can exchange currency is being discussed.This would mean that in a future financial crisis in Hungary, the US central bank could feed dollars to Budapest, which boosts financial security in Hungary.So in summary, Hungary struck a deal to buy US gas, nuclear energy and unspecified weapons systems in exchange for a temporary waiver from US sanctions on Russian oil and gas. But it failed to get the re-introduction of the US-Hungary dual taxation system, abolished in 2022, which harms mutual trade. And it did not get a new date for a potential Trump-Putin summit in Budapest as part of efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war.Critics say energy dependence on Russia is being replaced by energy dependence on the US. The Orban government argues it is achieving greater diversity of supply.",

    "body": "'I thought it was a prank' - How a Brazilian woman became the face of India vote fraud row4 days agoLuiz Fernando Toledo in London and Geeta Pandey & Yogita Limaye in IndiaBBC NewsCongress PartyLarissa Nery has found herself at the centre of a storm since Rahul Gandhi's press conference on WednesdayA Brazilian hairdresser Larissa Nery, who has been making headlines in India this week after her photograph was splashed over the news in an allegation about alleged election fraud, has told the BBC she initially thought it was all a mistake. Or a prank.But then her social media blew up and people started tagging her on Instagram.\"At first it was a few random messages. I thought they were mistaking me for someone else,\" she told the BBC. \"Then they sent me the video where my face appeared on a big screen. I thought it was AI or some joke. But then lots of people started messaging at the same time and I realised it was real.\"Nery, who lives in Belo Horizonte, capital city of southeastern Brazil's Minas Gerais state, and has never been to India, says she searched on Google to understand what was going on.What had happened was the fallout of a press conference by Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday where he accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party BJP and the Election Commission (EC) of committing voter fraud in last year's election in Haryana state. The BJP has denied the allegations. Hours after the press conference, in a post on X, the Chief Electoral Officer of Haryana shared a letter they said they had sent to Gandhi in August asking him to sign an oath with the names of ineligible voters \"so that necessary proceedings could be initiated\". They did not respond to the specific allegations he made and did not comment on Nery's case. The BBC has reached out to the poll panel for response.Gandhi has made a series of accusations of \"vote theft\" against the poll panel since early August.In his latest claims, he said his team had looked through the Election Commission's voter list data and found that of the approximately 20 million voters, 2.5 million were irregular entries - including duplicates, bulk voters and invalid addresses. He blamed his party's loss in the Haryana election on this alleged manipulation of the voters' list.To prove his claims, he showed a number of slides on a big screen. One of them showed Gandhi standing in front of a big image of Nery, while another showed a compilation of 22 voters with different names and addresses but all with her photos.BBC speaks to Larissa Nery\"Who is this lady? How old is she? She votes 22 times in Haryana,\" Gandhi said.He explained that a single stock photo of a woman, taken by Brazilian photographer Matheus Ferrero, had been used repeatedly across multiple voter entries under different names. He described Nery as a model who had appeared on the voters' list under many names, including Seema, Sweety and Saraswati.The 29-year-old confirmed to the BBC that it was indeed her in the photograph. \"Yes. It is me. Much younger, but it is me. I am the person in the images.\" She clarified that she was a hairdresser and not a model and that the photo was taken in March 2017 when she was 21, just outside her home. The photographer, she said, \"thought I was pretty and asked to take photos of me\".Now years later, all the attention in the past two days from \"people from India, many of them journalists\", has left her scared.\"I became scared. I cannot tell if it is dangerous for me or if speaking about it could harm someone there. I do not know who is right or wrong because I do not know the parties involved,\" she said.\"I did not go to work in the morning because I could not even see messages from my clients. Many journalists were calling me. They found the number of the place where I work. \"I had to remove the salon name from my profile because they were disturbing my workplace. My boss even spoke to me. Some people treat it like a meme, but it is affecting me professionally.\"Matheus Ferrero, who took Nery's photo, is also overwhelmed by the sudden attention. Until recently, he says India meant only Caminho das Índias - the 2009 Brazilian primetime show - to him.He's still trying to make sense of the events of the last few days in a country thousands of miles away.Some people had reached out to him from India a week back, asking him who the woman in the photo was, he told the BBC.\"I didn't reply. I'm not going to give someone's name like that. And I hadn't seen this friend in years,\" he told the BBC. \"I thought it was a scam. I blocked and reported it.\"But since Gandhi's press conference, \"things have exploded\".Congress PartyGandhi said Nery had appeared on the voters' list in Haryana under many names, including Seema, Sweety and Saraswati\"People were calling me on Instagram and Facebook. It was terrible. I deactivated my Instagram to try to understand what was going on. Later I googled it and realised what was happening, but at first I had no idea.\"Ferrero says some websites put his pictures next to the Nery's photo without permission. \"People were making memes, like turning it into a game show joke. It's absurd.\"In 2017, Ferrero was just starting out as a photographer when he invited Nery, who he knew, to come out for a photoshoot. Ferrero said he shared the photos on his Facebook and also posted them on Unsplash - a photo website - with her consent.\"The photo blew up… reached around 57 million views,\" he said.He has now deleted the link from his Unsplash account but he sent us screenshots taken earlier that showed other photos of Nery from the same shoot.Why India's Election Commission is facing a test of credibility  \"I deleted them out of fear, because the photos were being misused. I got scared imagining this happening to other people I photographed. I felt invaded. A lot of random people coming at me. You think 'Did I do something wrong?' But I didn't. The platform was open and I uploaded like millions of others.\" He's also now made the original Facebook post with her photos private.\"When you see people entering your Twitter, Facebook, personal Instagram, you panic. The first reaction is to shut everything down and understand later. Some people thought it was funny, like a soap opera, but I felt invaded.\"Neither Ferrero nor Nery have ever been to India and are still trying to understand how something that happened at the other end of the world could turn their lives upside down.We asked Ferrero if all this helped uncover electoral fraud, would that be positive?\"Yes, I think that would be positive. But I don't really know the details,\" he said.Nery who has never left the country says: \"This is far from my reality. I do not even follow elections in Brazil, let alone in another country.\"",

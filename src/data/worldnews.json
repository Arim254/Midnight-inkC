    "body": "3 hours agoCaroline Hawley,Diplomatic CorrespondentandAlys DaviesA member of Iran's security forces was killed during a fourth day of protests in the country, which have been sparked by a currency collapse, officials have said.Citing regional chief justice Saeed Shahvari, Iran's judiciary-affiliated Mizan news agency said Amir Hessam Khodayari Fard was killed in the city of Kouhdasht, in the western Lorestan province, on Wednesday.A number of members of the security forces were also injured, state media reported.Footage verified by BBC Persian appears to show security forces firing at protesters in the city on the same day.Confrontations were also reported in the southern province of Fars and the western province of Hamedan on Wednesday.The authorities in the capital, Tehran, had declared Wednesday a bank holiday - in an apparent effort to quell the unrest, which started in the capital on Sunday.The semi-official Fars news agency reported that a 21-year-old member of the Basij - a paramilitary force linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) - was killed during a confrontation in the city of Kouhdasht. Thirteen police officers and Basij members had been injured by stone throwing, the report said. Twenty protesters were arrested in the city on Wednesday night, the IRGC-affiliated Tasnim news agency said.Unrest broke out in other cities too.In the southern province of Fars, protesters tried to break into a local government building, with officials reporting three police officers injured and four people arrested in the city of Fasa.In video that emerged on social media and verified by the BBC, a crowd is filmed breaking the gate of the governor's office in the city.Then, in another post, security men are seen shooting in response. Clouds of tear gas rise in front of shuttered shops.Across the country, schools, universities and public institutions were closed because of the last-minute public holiday announced by the Iranian government.It was ostensibly to save energy because of the cold weather, though it was seen by many Iranians as an attempt to contain the protests.They began in Tehran - among shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and they had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who was accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly. But they have not been on the same scale.To prevent any escalation, tight security is now reported in the areas of Tehran where the demonstrations began.President Masoud Pezeshkian has said his government will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.But the prosecutor general, Mohammad Movahedi-Azad, has also warned that any attempt to create instability would be met with what he called a \"decisive response\".",

    "body": "Three hikers, including a 19-year-old who fell approximately 500 feet (150m), have been found dead on Mt Baldy, a looming snow-capped mountain known to be one of the most dangerous to climb in Southern California.Rescue workers found Marcus Alexander Muench Casanova, 19, dead and discovered two other dead hikers during the search, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department.The other two hikers were not hiking with the teenager, and it is not clear how long they had been deceased on the mountain.Casanova went hiking on 29 December with a friend who was able to call for help after the teen fell. The friend had to hike away from the fall site near the Devil's Backbone trail to an area with cell reception and provided their GPS location to rescue crews, authorities said. That companion was unharmed.Due to high winds, emergency crews were unable to complete a recovery operation by helicopter on Monday, but were able to recover the bodies on Tuesday.The sheriff's office said it had rescued five other hikers from the mountain in the previous five days.\"We are destroyed by the loss of our beloved Marcus,\" his family said in a statement on Wednesday. The statement described the California native as an \"avid sailor and outdoorsman\".Rising 10,064 feet (3068m) in the San Gabriel Mountains, Mt Baldy – officially known as Mt San Antonio – has become one of the deadliest peaks in the United States.More than 14 people have died on the mountain since 2020, including British actor Julian Sands in January 2023, although his remains were not found until five months later. More than 100 people have been rescued from the mountain since 2020.Proximity to Los Angeles means Mt Baldy attracts experienced and inexperienced climbers, and authorities urged people to stay off the mountain, especially during such unpredictable winter weather.\"It is one of the most dangerous trails we have here in our area,\" Jenny Smith, a spokesperson for the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, said of the Devil's Backbone trail during a news conference. \"We don't want novice hikers going up and hurting themselves.\"Southern California has been blanketed in rain and snow over the last week, but on 29 December, when the teen went hiking, the sun was shining, and the skies were blue with unusually clear visibility across the region.Mt Baldy was visible across Southern California, with breathtaking views from as far away as Catalina Island.The weather can change quickly on Mt Baldy, and conditions can be treacherous with snow and ice. Climbers venturing along the Devil's Backbone trail are advised to carry crampons and ice axes.Trails on the mountain have been temporarily closed until the new year following the deaths and the repeated rescue responses.",

In Bielefeld, Germany, local police said two 18-year-olds died after setting off homemade fireworks.The head of the Dutch Police Union, Nine Kooiman, said she had been pelted by fireworks and other explosives on her shift in Amsterdam.The amount of violence was \"unprecedented\" she said.Reports of attacks against police and firefighters were widespread across the country. Petrol bombs were thrown at police in the southern city of Breda. In Rotterdam, the city's eye hospital said it had treated 14 patients, including 10 minors, for eye injuries. Two received surgery.A 17-year-old boy from Nijmegen and a 38-year-old man from Aalsmeer were killed in fireworks incidents, local media reported.In Amsterdam the 50-metre high tower of the historic Vondelkerk church collapsed. Authorities said the roof was badly damaged but the structure was expected to remain intact.The neo-Gothic basilica was designed by architect Pierre Cuypers whose works also include the Rijksmuseum. A ban on unofficial fireworks is due to come into force in 2026. According to the Dutch Pyrotechnics Association, a record €129m (£112m) had been spent on them this year.",

    "body": "24 hours agoRozina SiniandTom BennettReutersA train driver was killed and at least 40 others were injured in the crash on TuesdayA passenger has described \"chaos\" after two trains collided head-on near Peru's most popular tourist attraction, Machu Picchu.Niels Honkoop, 33, told the BBC he had switched seats part-way through the journey from the middle of the train to the back, before it crashed, injuring many of those sitting near the front.\"I saw staff running around and people crying and people on the floor and chaos erupted,\" he said. \"We got off the train and I saw people bleeding with very severe injuries.\"A train driver was killed and at least 40 others were injured in the crash, which took place at around 13:20 local time (18:20 GMT) on Tuesday. Mr Honkoop said the table in front of him broke in two. Shattered glass littered the floor of the carriage, and many were lying wounded in the aisle. One woman he saw was trapped \"between a bench and a table\". He tried to assist by moving luggage and handing out painkillers, as, by coincidence, \"I'd had a wisdom tooth removed recently so I had lots of painkillers on me\".AFP via Getty ImagesThe UK Foreign Office said it was \"supporting a number of British nationals involved\" in the crash, while the US embassy in Peru said that US citizens were injured. After the crash, Mr Honkoop said another train arrived with medical assistance. He and his tour group were taken to a nearby village where they were given food and medical care and taken to a hotel. The collision occurred on the track linking Ollantaytambo Station and Aguas Calientes, the closest town to Machu Picchu. The journey between the two stations usually takes around 90 minutes.The two trains involved were operated by PeruRail and Inca Rail respectively.Niels HonkoopNiels Honkoop (right) described the accident as \"chaos\"\"We deeply regret what has happened,\" PeruRail said in a statement, adding that its staff had \"immediately\" provided first aid to the train driver, the train conductor and the passengers involved in the incident.The cause of the accident has not yet been made clear.It comes amid an ongoing dispute between providers of transport to the Unesco world heritage site, with local communities unhappy with what they say is an insufficiently open bidding process.The trains and buses that take tourists to the ancient town have steep ticket prices and can be highly lucrative for operators due to its limited accessibility.Built in the Peruvian Andes in the 15th Century, the Incan city of Machu Picchu is one of the Seven Modern Wonders of the World.Visitors can take a series of trains and buses to reach the site, or hike along the Inca trail with a registered tour operator.In 2011, officials implemented a daily cap on visitors to protect and preserve the site, but concerns remain about over-tourism.Watch: Injured passengers helped from train after collision near Machu PicchuMore on this story",

    "body": "A worker at Walt Disney World is \"recovering\" after being injured by a 400-lb (180kg) runaway fake boulder prop in an incident that was caught on video, the Florida theme park confirmed. The incident took place at the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular! during a live recreation of a famous scene from the film.Video shows the boulder rolling towards the audience as a staff member jumps into its path, preventing it from reaching the crowd.\"We're focused on supporting our cast member, who is recovering,\" Disney said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Safety is at the heart of what we do, and that element of the show will be modified as our safety team completes a review of what happened.\"The scene from 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark shows Indiana Jones - played by Harrison Ford - outrunning a giant boulder triggered by a booby trap, before leaping to safety.Video of the incident on Tuesday shows the boulder bouncing off its tracks, and then bounding towards the audience as a staff member steps into its path and is knocked to the ground.The staff member did not appear to stand up immediately, and other workers are seen running to his side.According to a blog run by the park, the boulder prop is approximately 400-lbs and made of rubber. A spokesperson for Disney did not confirm that the boulder was the cause of the incident, but told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that \"a prop moved off its track\".One witness told People magazine that the worker had \"saved\" the audience from being injured. \"It was a crazy experience and definitely one that we will remember.\"In one video of the incident, a man behind the camera is heard saying: \"He literally saved our lives, that guy.\"",

    "body": "49 minutes agoJemma CrewVideo shows Swiss ski resort bar on fireSeveral dozen people are presumed dead and around 100 injured after a fire ripped through a bar in a ski resort in southern Switzerland, officials have said.The fire broke out at around 01:30 (00:30 GMT) during new year celebrations in a bar called Le Constellation in Crans-Montana, police said.People from multiple countries have been affected, according to Swiss authorities, and \"significant work\" will be needed to identify victims and return bodies to families.Officials investigating the incident have not mentioned any cause, but categorically ruled out an attack.Ten helicopters, 40 ambulances and 150 emergency responders were sent overnight to the scene of the fire in the Valais region, which is popular with tourists.Most of the injured experienced severe burns and were sent to Valais hospital, said Mathias Reynard, the region's council leader, in a press conference on Thursday morning.Follow live updatesWhat we know about the fireIts intensive care unit had reached full capacity and Reynard said the local community must take extra care to avoid needing hospital treatment unnecessarily.Some people have been taken to hospitals in Lausanne and Zurich which have specialist burns units.A spokesperson for Lausanne University Hospital said they were treating 22 patients with burn injuries, while Zurich University Hospital said it was treating 12 patients for burns.Details are still emerging, and it is not yet known the precise number of people who have been killed and injured, their nationalities, the cause of the fire or how many people were in the bar. Officials have, however, confirmed that several nationalities were involved.The Italian foreign ministry said information from Swiss police indicated around 40 people had died.Police at the press conference said \"several dozen\" were presumed dead, but did not give a more precise number when responding to questions from the media.EPA/ShutterstockLocal media reports earlier on Thursday suggested pyrotechnics could have caused the incident, although this is unconfirmed.Valais canton prosecutor general Beatrice Pilloud said an investigation was under way \"to identify the circumstances which caused this dramatic situation to occur\".She told the press conference \"currently we are favouring a fire and at no time is there question of any attack\", adding out of respect for the families she cannot say more at this time.Police initially referred to an explosion but later changed their definition to a fire, adding it was too early to speculate on the cause.Asked about the cause at the news conference, regional security official Stéphane Ganzer said it \"is not the detonation of an explosive device that causes the fire, it is the fire which, as it develops, causes an explosion and a general conflagration of the premises\".Work is ongoing to identify the victims and return bodies to families as quickly as possible, Ms Pilloud said, adding: \"To do that there is significant work which needs to be carried out. And this significant work will require the closure of the district.\"The Italian ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado, said that it will take weeks to identify the dead.A helpline has been set up for families: +41 848 112 117Watch: BBC reports from the scene of Swiss resort bar fireSwiss President Guy Parmelin said: \"A moment of joy turned into a tragedy that has touched the whole of Switzerland and abroad.\"Crans-Montana is a luxury ski resort, famous in the 1980s for hosting the World Cup skiing.Le Constellation, which has been around for decades, has an upstairs with TV screens where people go and watch football matches, and a large bar downstairs for drinking and dancing.The UK Foreign Office said its \"thoughts are with all those injured and killed in the terrible tragedy\" and consular staff were on standby to provide support to any British nationals affected.",

    "body": "6 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterUS Southern CommandA screengrab from a video posted by US Southern Command shows a small vessel in the sea with what appears to be debris floating nearby.The US military says it struck two boats it alleges were carrying drugs on Wednesday, killing five people on board.US Southern Command did not say where it had carried out the latest strikes but US forces have been targeting vessels they suspect of smuggling narcotics to the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific for the past three months. Wednesday's strike came a day after the US targeted what it said were \"three narco-trafficking vessels travelling as a convoy\", killing at least three people.The Trump administration has cast its operations as a non-international armed conflict with the alleged traffickers but legal experts say they could be in violation of the laws governing such conflict.In total, there have been more than 30 strikes on vessels as part of the Trump administration's \"war on drugs\" with more than 110 people killed since the US carried out its first attack on a boat in international waters on 2 September. That first attack has come under particular scrutiny from lawmakers in Washington since it emerged that US forces struck the targeted boat twice.Two people who had survived the first strike and were clinging to the hull of their boat were killed in the second. Some lawmakers expressed concern that the \"double-tap\" strike breached the rules of engagement. In its post announcing the strike on a convoy of three boats carried out on 30 December, US Southern Command said that there had been a number of survivors, without specifying how many.It said that \"the remaining narco-terrorists abandoned the other two vessels, jumping overboard and distancing themselves before follow-on engagements sank their respective vessels\". It added that the US Coast Guard had been \"immediately notified\" to search for the survivors.Reuters news agency reports that it was told by a US official who asked to remain anonymous that eight survivors were being searched for.It is not yet clear if any of them have been found. The US has provided no evidence that the boats it has targeted are carrying drugs but in its most recent post, Southern Command again insisted that \"intelligence confirmed the vessels were transiting along known narco-trafficking routes and engaged in narco-trafficking\".",

    "body": "18 hours agoNick ThorpeCentral Europe correspondentBulgaria - the poorest country in the European Union - has become the 21st member of the eurozone - leapfrogging more obvious and prosperous candidates like Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.For mostly urban, young and entrepreneurial Bulgarians, it's an optimistic and  potentially lucrative leap - the final move in a game which has brought Bulgaria into the European mainstream - from Nato and EU membership, to joining the Schengen zone, and now the euro.For the older, rural, more conservative parts of the population, the replacement of the Bulgarian lev by the euro provokes fear and resentment.The lev - meaning lion - has been the Bulgarian currency since 1881, but it has been pegged to other European currencies since 1997 - first the Deutschmark, then the euro.Opinion polls put Bulgaria's 6.5 million population more or less equally divided on the new currency, and political turmoil is not making the transition easy. Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov's coalition government lost a confidence vote on 11 December, after mass protests against the 2026 budget. Bulgaria has held seven elections in the past four years - an eighth looks likely early next year.\"I don't want the euro, and I don't like the way it has been imposed on us,\" Todor, 50, a small business owner in the central town of Gabrovo, at the foot of the Balkan mountains, told the BBC. \"If there were a referendum, I reckon 70% of the people would vote against it.\" A referendum on euro adoption was proposed by President Rumen Radev but rejected by the outgoing government. Todor's business, producing coloured plastics for the domestic market, had a bad  year because of high inflation, he said, and a fall in sales fuelled, he believed, by fear of the euro.Ognian Enev, 60, who owns a tea shop in central Sofia, was more enthusiastic. \"On the whole, it's a good thing. It's just a technical change. It doesn't bother me,\" he told the BBC. In any case, he pointed out, people who bought flats or cars until now have got used to prices marked in euros. The 1.2 million Bulgarians who live outside the country have also been sending money home for years in euros.Like many shopkeepers, Ognian has the new currency ready, in coins and small denomination notes, ready for the transition. Throughout January, you can pay in both lev and euros, but change is supposed to be in euros. From 1 February, it will no longer be permitted to pay in lev. He hopes joining the single currency will be good for trade - many of his flavoured and fruit teas come from sellers in the eurozone, while the more expensive, high-end teas are imported direct from China and Japan.Since August 2025, all shops in Bulgaria have been required by law to display prices in both currencies. Conveniently, €1 is worth about two lev (1.95583 to be exact). In response to public fears that prices will be rounded up, elaborate watchdogs have been created, to protect consumers. And some prices have been rounded down: the cost of public transport in the capital Sofia is due to fall slightly.The design on the reverse side of the new eurocoins was chosen to overcome worries that Bulgaria is losing its sovereignty. St Ivan of Rila is on the €1 coin, Paisius of Hilendar, an 18th Century monk and champion of the national revival, is on the €2 coin. The smaller denomination eurocents carry an image of the Madara rider, a symbol of early Bulgarian statehood, based on an 8th Century rock relief.Just how the new currency will impact Bulgaria as a whole, concerns everyone. The lessons from other countries offer two versions - the successful \"Baltic model\" followed by Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which combined the euro with reforms to streamline administration, encourage investment and combat corruption. And the \"Italian model\", where years of stagnation followed.\"I'm afraid we'll be more like Italy,\" Ognian Enev predicted.",

    "body": "25 minutes agoBen TobiasWatch: BBC reports from the scene of Swiss resort bar fireSeveral dozen people are thought to have died and more than 100 injured following a fire in a ski resort in south-west Switzerland, officials have said.Police said several nationalities were likely involved in the New Year's Day fire, which happened at 01:30 local time (00:30 GMT) in a bar called Le Constellation in the resort of Crans-Montana. It is being treated as a fire and there is \"no question\" of an attack, the region's chief prosecutor said.LATEST UPDATES: Read more about the Swiss ski resort fireA helpline has been set up for concerned families: +41 848 112 117Here's what we know so far. What do we know about the victims? At a news conference on Thursday morning police said \"several dozen\" people were presumed to have died in the fire, although it was too early to give a precise number. The Italian foreign ministry - citing Swiss police - said it believed around 40 people had died.More than 100 people were injured, mostly with severe burns, Swiss officials said. They have been transported to hospitals across Switzerland. A burns unit in Milan in neighbouring Italy has also been made available. The director of Lausanne University Hospital told a Swiss newspaper that 22 patients had been transferred to her centre's care so far, mostly aged 16-26. Work is ongoing to identify the victims and return bodies to families as quickly as possible, the region's chief-prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud said.But the Italian ambassador to Switzerland warned it could take weeks to identify the dead. Earlier, Italy's foreign minister said identification would be difficult due to the severe burns. People from several countries are believed to be involved. The Italian Foreign Ministry has told the BBC that 16 Italian nationals are currently missing, and between 12 and 15 others are receiving treatment in hospital.  French media has reported that at least two of the injured are French nationals. French President Emmanuel Macron has offered \"the full solidarity of France and our fraternal support\" to Switzerland. The UK embassy in Switzerland says it is monitoring the situation but it has not been approached for assistance. Consular staff are on standby to support any British nationals affected, a Foreign Office statement said.What caused the fire? The cause is currently unknown but authorities say initial evidence does not suggest an attack.Asked about earlier reports of an explosion, regional security official Stéphane Ganzer said it \"is not the detonation of an explosive device that causes the fire, it is the fire which, as it develops, causes an explosion and a general conflagration of the premises\".Two French nationals who said they were in the bar at the time described seeing a waitress put a birthday candle on top of a champagne bottle. \"One of the candles was held too close to the ceiling, which caught fire. In a matter of seconds, the entire ceiling was ablaze. Everything was made of wood.\" Emma and Albane told French media outlet BFMTV.They described the evacuation as \"very difficult\" because the escape route was \"narrow\" and the stairs to get outside \"even narrower\". The regional police commander Frédéric Gisler said smoke was first seen emanating from a bar at around 01:30 local time, at which point emergency services were called. The first police officers were quickly on the scene followed by a major deployment of rescue teams, Mr Gisler said. Video shows moment Swiss bar fire appears to startWhat do we know about Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana? Le Constellation is a large bar in the the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana which has been around for many years. Although the resort itself is quite upmarket, Le Constellation was not particularly posh, the BBC's Silvia Costeloe reported from the resort.Upstairs, there is an area with TV screens where people go to watch football matches. Downstairs is a big bar where people were likely drinking and dancing. It could hold up to 300 people and had a small terrace, although it is unknown how many people were there at the time of the fire. The Christmas and New Year holidays are one of the busiest times of the year for Alpine ski resorts, and it is likely the bar was full of Swiss people and tourists celebrating the start of 2026. Police Cantonale ValaisannePolice have released images from inside the bar after the fire showing chairs and benches strewn across the room",

    "body": "11 hours agoLaura Gozzi,KyivandJames ChaterUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said a peace agreement to end the war with Russia is \"90% ready\", in a New Year address that largely focused on resistance to Moscow's full-scale invasion.Zelensky said the remaining 10% of the agreement to end nearly four years of conflict would \"determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe\".In his own New Year speech, Russian President Vladimir Putin told his troops that \"we believe in you and our victory\".Earlier on Wednesday, Moscow also released what it said was evidence of Ukraine using drones to target Putin's private home on Lake Valdai in north-west Russia, allegations Kyiv has strenuously denied. It included a map allegedly showing that the drones were launched from the Sumy and Chernihiv regions of Ukraine and a video of a downed drone lying in snowy woodland. A serviceman standing next to the wreckage claims it is a Ukrainian Chaklun drone. The BBC hasn't been able to verify the footage, and it is not possible to locate where it was shot.Russia would review its position on the ongoing peace negotiations as a result of the alleged incident, the Kremlin said.However, Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, on Wednesday described the Russian claims as a \"deliberate distraction\" and an attempt to derail the peace process.In his 20-minute address to the nation, Zelensky said that Ukraine did not want peace \"at any cost\", adding that \"we want the end of the war – not the end of Ukraine\". He said that a Ukrainian withdrawal from the eastern Donbas region means \"everything will be over\", a reference to Russia's maximalist demand that Moscow secure full control of the industrial area in any peace agreement. Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions are known collectively as Donbas.Its fate has been a major obstacle throughout negotiations, with Russia consistently unwilling to compromise on its aim to seize full control of Donbas. In the address, Zelensky thanked leaders that have supported Ukraine, but said that \"intentions must become security guarantees, and therefore - be ratified\". Following talks between Zelensky and his US counterpart Donald Trump in Florida earlier this week, the Ukrainian leader said Washington had offered security guarantees for 15 years - but a time frame for their implementation is not yet clear.\"Signatures under weak agreements only fuel war,\" Zelensky said in his address. \"Either the world stops Russia's war, or Russia drags the world into its war.\"By comparison, Putin's New Year address was much shorter.Addressing the war in Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a \"special military operation\", Putin said: \"We strive to bring joy and warmth through our care for those in need of support and, of course, to stand by our heroes – the participants in the special military operation – in both word and deed.\"Separately, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used his New Year message to praise the \"invincible alliance\" between Pyongyang and Moscow, while praising soldiers who are fighting in \"alien lands\". North Korea has sent thousands of troops to aid Russia in its invasion, along with missiles and long-range weapons, South Korean officials have said. At least 600 of those soldiers have died, according to South Korean estimates. Zelensky has expressed a desire for peace negotiations to resume and accelerate this month with the involvement of both US and European officials.French President Emmanuel Macron said European states and allies who are due to meet in Paris on 6 January \"will make concrete commitments to protect Ukraine and ensure a just and lasting peace on our European continent\".On Wednesday, Trump's advisers held talks with Zelensky and national security advisers from the UK, France and Germany about ending the war in Ukraine.US special envoy Steve Witkoff said they discussed \"strengthening security guarantees and developing effective deconfliction mechanisms to help end the war and ensure it does not restart\".But any deal will ultimately need Russian buy-in, which does not seem forthcoming - and which the alleged drone incident over Putin's residence may have pushed further into the distance.

We want people to be safe in our community,\" he added.British tourists Joe and Lucy said the increased police presence reassured them. The pair - who timed their Australia trip to coincide with the fireworks - were in Melbourne when the shooting occurred.\"We had our worries about coming for New Year's Eve,\" Joe told the BBC, adding, \"but we were reading more recently in the news... how more police were going to be here, it would be a bit safer\".Separately, Minns had urged Sydneysiders to not let the \"horrible criminal terrorist event\" at Bondi change the way they live, as he called on people to \"show defiance\" and celebrate the new year.This sentiment was shared by some of the spectators.Out among the crowds at Barangaroo's Observatory Hill, a close spot to the Sydney Harbour Bridge, was Hélène from Belgium.She told the BBC people \"cannot live in fear\" following the attack.Hours ahead of the countdown, hundreds of thousands of people flocked towards the harbour, with many official viewing areas filling to capacity by early evening.On the harbour, sailboats dotted the water - one of the best spots to watch the midnight fireworks display.Sydney's celebration - with its iconic fireworks display - kicked off a chain of events, from Dubai, to London and New York.Getty ImagesArmed police carrying assault rifles patrol outside the Sydney Opera House",

    "body": "17 hours agoOsmond Chia,Business reporterandYan Chen,BBC News ChineseGetty ImagesPeople in China will pay a 13% sales tax on contraceptives from 1 January, while childcare services will be exempt, as the world's second-largest economy tries to boost birth rates.An overhaul of the tax system announced late last year removes many exemptions that were in place since 1994, when China was still enforcing its decades-long one-child rule.It also exempts marriage-related services and elderly care from value added tax (VAT) - part of a broader effort that includes extending parental leave and issuing cash handouts.Faced with an ageing population and sluggish economy, Beijing has been trying hard to encourage more young Chinese people to marry, and couples to have children.Official figures show that China's population has shrunk three years in a row, with just 9.54 million babies born in 2024. That is around half of the number of births recorded a decade ago, when China started to ease its rules on how many children people could have. Still, the tax on contraceptives, including condoms, birth control pills and devices, has sparked concern about unwanted pregnancies and HIV rates, as well as ridicule. Some people point out that it would take a lot more than pricey condoms to persuade them to have children.As one retailer urged shoppers to stock up ahead of the price hike, a social media user joked: \"I'll buy a lifetime's worth of condoms now.\"People can tell the difference between the price of a condom and that of raising a child, wrote another. China is one of the most expensive countries in which to raise a child, according to a 2024 report by the YuWa Population Research Institute in Beijing. Costs are pushed up by school fees in a highly competitive academic environment, and the challenge women have juggling work and parenting, the study said.The economic slowdown, partly brought on by a property crisis that has hit savings, has left families, and especially young people, feeling uncertain or less confident about their future.   \"I have one child, and I don't want any more,\" says 36-year-old Daniel Luo, who lives in the eastern province of Henan.\"It's like when subway fares increase. When they go up by a yuan or two, people who take the subway don't change their habits. You still have to take the subway, right?\"He says he is not concerned by the price hike. \"A box of condoms might cost an extra five yuan, maybe 10, at most 20. Over a year, that's just a few hundred yuan, completely affordable.\"Getty ImagesYoung couples in China, like elsewhere, are having fewer or no childrenBut cost might be a problem for others, and that's what worries Rosy Zhao, who lives in the city of Xi'an in central China.She says making contraception, which is a necessity, more expensive could mean students or those struggling financially \"take a risk\".That would be the policy's \"most dangerous potential outcome\", she added.Observers appear divided on the aim of the tax overhaul. The idea that a tax hike on condoms will impact birth rates is \"overthinking it\", says demographer Yi Fuxian from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.He believes Beijing is keen to collect taxes \"wherever it can\" as it battles a housing market slump and growing national debt.At nearly $1tn (£742bn), China's VAT revenue made up close to 40% of the country's tax collection last year.The move to tax condoms is \"symbolic\" and reflects Beijing's attempts to encourage people to lift China's \"strikingly low\" fertility numbers, said Henrietta Levin from the Center for Strategic and International Studies.What is also hampering efforts, she adds, is that a lot of the policies and subsidies will have to be implemented by indebted provincial governments - and it's unclear if they can spare sufficient resources.China's approach to urging people to have children also risks backfiring if people feel the government is being \"too intrusive\" about what is deeply personal choice, she said.Recently there have been media reports that women in some provinces have received calls from local officials asking about their menstrual cycles and plans to have children. The local health bureau in Yunnan province said such data was needed to identify expectant mothers.But this has not helped the government's image, Ms Levin said. \"The [Communist] party can't help but insert itself into every decision that it cares about. So it ends up being its own worst enemy in some ways.\"Getty ImagesChina is one of the priciest countries to raise a child, a study in 2024 found Observers and women themselves say the country's male-dominated leadership fails to understand the social changes underpinning these broader shifts, which are not exclusive to China. Countries in the West and even those in the region, such as South Korea and Japan,   have been struggling to lift birth rates as their population ages.  Part of the reason is the burden of childcare, which disproportionately falls on women, research shows. But there are also other shifts, such as a decline in marriage and even dating. China's measures miss the real problem: the way young people interact today, which increasingly avoids genuine human connections, Mr Luo from Henan said. He points to rising sales of sex toys in China, which he believes is a sign that \"people are just satisfying themselves\" because \"interacting with another person has become more of a burden\". Being online is easier and more comforting, he says, as \"the pressure is real\". \"Young people today deal with way more stress from society than people did 20 years ago. Sure, materially they're better off, but the expectations placed on them are much higher. Everyone's just exhausted.\"",

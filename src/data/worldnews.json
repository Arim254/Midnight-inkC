    "body": "A bulky bluefin tuna made a splash at Tokyo's Toyosu fish market on Monday morning, fetching a record 510.3 million yen ($3.2m; £2.4m) at the market's first auction of the year.The winning bid for the 243kg fish came from Kiyomura Corp, the operator of popular sushi chain Sushi Zanmai, which has outlets across the country and abroad.\"The year's first tuna brings good luck,\" said Kiyoshi Kimura, the company's president and a familiar figure at the annual new year's auction, Kyodo reported.Mr Kimura, who has been dubbed the Tuna King, is known to bid high for bluefin tuna at new year's auctions. The entrepreneur told reporters after the auction that he was \"surprised at the price\", AFP reported.\"I'd thought we would be able to buy a little cheaper, but the price soared before you knew it,\" he said.Mr Kimura paid 56.5 million yen for a bluefin tuna in 2012 and 155 million yen in 2013 - setting record prices both times.In 2019 he bought a bluefin tuna with 333.6 million yen ($2.1m; £1.6m) - another historic price.Despite telling reporters at the time that he thought he \"did too much\", however, Mr Kimura has now gone on to break his own record again.The first auction at Tokyo's Toyosu fish market typically sees fish selling for exorbitant prices.Last year, the first tuna at the auction was bought for 207 million yen by Onodera Group, another food company that owns a sushi chain. It said that the fish would be served at its restaurants across the country.The frenetic energy at fish markets during such pre-dawn auctions has become a popular tourist attraction in Tokyo. Monday's auction, which started at around 05:00 local time (20:00 GMT), was no exception.The million-dollar tuna was sliced up for customers at Kimura's sushi restaurants shortly after it was auctioned off.\"I feel like I've begun the year in a good way after eating something so auspicious as the year starts,\" one of the customers at Mr Kimura's restaurant told AFP.",

    "body": "All 116 people injured in a bar fire at a Swiss ski resort have now been identified, officials have said.Forty people were killed when a fire tore through a busy venue in Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve, with victims' age ranging from 14 to 39 years old.While the dead had all previously been identified, work had been ongoing to establish who the injured are, some of whom remain in a critical condition. Swiss police confirmed on Monday that 83 people remained in hospital, with the injured including at least 12 nationalities.Most of the injured suffered severe burns, which in some cases meant they could not be identified, police have said.Investigators said 119 people had been injured but that number has been revised down in the latest update. A criminal investigation has been launched into the French couple who managed the Le Constellation bar - a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16.Sparklers on bottles being carried too close to the ceiling were the likely cause of the fire, a preliminary investigation has found.Beatrice Pilloud, Valais canton lead prosecutor, said in a statement that investigators were looking into whether the acoustic foam on the venue's ceiling was \"the cause of the problem\", as well as \"whether it complies with regulations\".Details have begun to emerge about some of those who lost their lives in the tragedy. Among them was Charlotte Niddam, believed to be 15, who was a pupil at two UK schools. Her family wrote on social media: \"It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beautiful daughter and sister Charlotte.\"The mother of Arthur Brodard, 16, confirmed he had died in the fire.She said in a video message: \"We can start our mourning, knowing that he is in peace and in the light.\"Italian media named junior golfer Emanuele Galeppini, 16, as also being among the victims.Italian Golf Federation paying tribute to the \"young athlete who carried with him passion and authentic values\".",

    "body": "A far-left activist group in Germany has claimed responsibility for a suspected arson attack that left tens of thousands of homes, as well as hospitals and businesses, without power in around-freezing temperatures.The Vulkangruppe (Volcano Group) said in a statement that the fossil fuel economy, not cutting power, was the target of the action.It will take until Thursday to reconnect power for all customers, with some schools due to be closed at the start of this week.Early on Saturday, several cables on a bridge were spotted burning near a power plant in south-west Berlin. The fire was quickly put out, but around 45,000 households and 2,200 businesses were left without electricity.The state economy minister told German media that incendiary devices had caused the damage.Berlin's mayor condemned the attack, accusing \"suspected left-wing extremists\" of knowingly endangering lives, especially those of patients in hospitals.Hospitals and care facilities had received emergency power generators, officials said. The response had included transferring individuals from care sites and people requiring care in their own homes from the affected area to care facilities with reported available capacity.Some hospitals had their electricity restored by Sunday.As of Sunday afternoon, around 10,000 households and 300 businesses had been reconnected, with most still waiting to receive power back.Some schools, which were due to reopen on Monday after the Christmas holidays, will remain closed.The capital's electricity operator said it would take until Thursday to reconnect all customers.The Vulkangruppe in its statement apologised to less affluent residents impacted by the power cuts, but said it had less sympathy for \"the many owners of villas\".The statement said the attack on the gas-fired power plant was an \"act of self-defence\" and solidarity with those who protect the earth.Police told AFP news agency they believed the statement was \"plausible\" while they continued to investigate, with other media reporting police thought it was credible.The Vulkangruppe previously claimed responsibility for a suspected arson attack that halted production at Tesla's Berlin car factory in 2024.",

    "body": "2 days agoAleks PhillipsandNikos PapanikolaouGetty ImagesThessaloniki Airport closed entirely after air traffic communication was knock outThousands of passengers are stranded across Europe after a communications failure forced Greece to close its airspace, causing widespread cancellations and delays.Officials are working to understand why radio communications were disrupted on Sunday morning, prompting the temporary suspension of arrivals and departures.Some departures have since been allowed to resume - though inbound flights are still being told to divert or return to their point of origin. Athens' main airport is among the worst affected, while Thessaloniki airport has closed entirely.The timing of the disruption has raised fears that travellers will not be able to get home before the start of the working week.\"I was supposed to fly to London, via Stockholm, with SAS,\" one passenger at Athens International Airport told Greek broadcaster Mega TV. \"I'm working on Newport Hospital tomorrow morning. I'm not going to be there on time, I don't know what else to say. \"Who is going to pay for the additional cost this travel will cost me? We still don't know if and when we're going to leave, no one is telling us anything.\"More than 90 flights have been affected in and out of Athens airport alone - though some flights have since been able to resume.A member of staff in the airport told the BBC that 35 aircraft an hour were now being allowed to take off, but it was still unable to take inbound flights.Flights departing from Dublin, Barcelona and Paris were earlier ordered to return to their airports of origin, while services from Copenhagen and Malta were cancelled altogether. Other arrivals into Athens were placed on standby, while flights in and out of other Greek airports have also been affected. Three flights out of Heraklion airport on the island of Crete, including one to Munich, have been delayed, according to public broadcaster ERT.Most inbound flights are being diverted to Turkey if not cancelled outright, it reports.Reuters / Flightradar24Greek airspace was nearly empty earlier on Sunday due to the technical faultThe disruption comes at a busy time for air travel in and out of Athens, which typically sees more than 600 scheduled flights per day, as people return from winter holidays.In the chaos, some passengers have complained of a lack of information. One told news site Flash: \"We have no updates. They told us that we will be able to leave but I don't think this is true. On the departures board I can't see my flight, and I'm supposed to leave shortly.\"Another, who had been on a flight to Rhodes when it turned around and headed back to Athens, told news agency Reuters: \"From that moment until now we have no information whatsoever.\"Domestic travellers may have the option of getting home on Greece's rail network, but this would take significantly longer.The issue that caused the disruption is thought to concern the radio system used by air traffic controllers to communicate with planes in their airspace.Panagiotis Psarros, chair of the Association of Greek Air Traffic Controllers, told ERT that all frequencies were \"suddenly lost\", adding: \"We could not communicate with aircraft in the sky.\"The broadcaster later reported than an initial investigation by the Greek security services suggested the problem may be due to the failure of an antenna in the Gerania Mountains near Athens. Italy, Turkey and Cyprus are assisting Greece in managing the situation.",

It is illegal to pay ransom money to the criminal groups, which the government has classified as terrorists, but there are claims this is often ignored.Zakari KontagoraThe attack on Kasuwan-Daji is the latest is a spike of violent attacks against villages in Niger stateA witness to the attack told BBC Hausa that there were no security forces in the village. \"We want the government to help us. In the past, we used to hear about this problem in other places, but now it is happening in our villages,\" he said.The fear is driving people from their homes where they were born and raised.\"We are dying like chickens, and does the government care about us? \"The government hears and sees what is happening, but it is not doing anything about it. What can we do as ordinary people?\"Zakari KontagoraVillagers say the attacks are driving people away from the villages they grew up in",

    "body": "Donald Trump's warning that the US will intervene if peaceful protesters are killed was \"reckless and dangerous\", Iran's foreign minister has said.Abbas Araghchi's comments came after the US president said Washington \"will come to their rescue\" in reference to demonstrators taking part in protests over Iran's economy, writing in a brief social media post: \"We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"Araghchi indicated Iran's armed forces were on standby and \"know exactly where to aim\" in the event of an attack.At least eight people are reported to have died during the week-long protests, as of Saturday morning.Trump wrote on Friday: \"If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"The US president did not specify what action Washington might take. Previously, it has carried out strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, which elicited a retaliatory strike on a US base in Qatar.\"Given President Trump's deployment of the National Guard within US borders, he of all people should know that criminal attacks on public property cannot be tolerated,\" Araghchi wrote on X.Iran would \"forcefully reject any interference in their internal affairs\", he added.On Saturday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei addressed the wave of protests, saying that \"rioters must be put in their place\". He said shopkeepers' original protest about the collapse in foreign exchange rates was \"legitimate\", but he claimed people \"provoked by the enemy\" were taking advantage to shout anti-government slogans.Protests have spread to a number of cities and towns with running battles reported between security forces and demonstrators. On Saturday the state-affiliated Mehr and Fars news agencies reported that two protesters and a member of the security forces were killed in the western town of Malekshahi when, they said, protesters tried to enter a police station.The EU said it was \"concerned\" by reports of deaths and called for Tehran to exercise \"maximum restraint\" against the protesters as well as upholding their right to \"freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly\".The protests began in Tehran, with shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and the protests had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.Two people have since died in clashes between protesters and security forces in the south-western city of Lordegan, according to the semi-official Fars news agency and the human rights group Hengaw, which said they were protesters, naming them as Ahmad Jalil and Sajjad Valamanesh.Three people were killed in Azna, while another died in Kouhdasht, all in the west of the country, Fars reported. It did not specify whether they were demonstrators or security forces personnel.One death was reported in Fuladshahr, central Iran, and another casualty in Marvdasht, in the south.BBC has not been able to independently verify the deaths.The demonstrations have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly, but they have not been on the same scale.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has previously said he will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.

    "body": "The Cuban government says 32 of its nationals were killed during the US operation to seize Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.It described the dead as members of its armed forces and intelligence agencies were killed \"in combat actions\", declaring two days of national mourning. The armed forces added the Cubans \"fell, after fierce resistance, in direct combat against the attackers or as a result of bombardments of installations\"Cuba, a long-standing ally of Venezuela, has for years supplied Maduro with his personal security detail and has personnel throughout the Venezuelan military.Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel said the country had been providing protection to Maduro and his wife \"at the request\" of Venezuela. US spies had been monitoring Maduro's movements for months before US forces struck, according to US General Dan Caine.Gen Caine said that they had learned where the former leader moved, lived, travelled, ate, and worked.The New York Times reported that the CIA had also recruited a \"Venezuelan source\"  who it says informed the Americans of Maduro's exact location.Many of those killed are believed to have been part of Maduro's close security detail, who were with him at the time. Venezuela has not confirmed how many people were killed, but its armed forces  have said that a \"large part\" of Maduro's security team were among the casualties.An official statement from the Cuban government read: \"Our compatriots fulfilled their duty with dignity and heroism\".The total death toll - according to an unnamed Venezuelan official cited by the New York Times - stood at 80 and was expected to rise. BBC News has not independently verified that report. In the days following the seizure of Maduro, questions have been raised over whether the Trump administration could consider a similar operation against Cuba, which, like Venezuela, has had decades of adversarial relations with the US.Speaking to reporters on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said military action would not be necessary because \"Cuba is ready to fall\". He continued: \"I don't think we need any action. Looks like it's going down. It's going down for the count.\"On Saturday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio described Cuba as a \"disaster\" run by \"incompetent, senile men\". \"If I lived in Havana, and I was in the government, I'd be concerned - at least a little bit,\" Rubio said.In July last year, Trump signed a memorandum imposing tighter restrictions on Cuba, reversing moves by his predecessor, Joe Biden, easing pressure on the Caribbean island nation. The White House said it would end \"economic practices that disproportionately benefit the Cuban government, military, intelligence, or security agencies at the expense of the Cuban people\".It also said existing restrictions on Americans visiting Cuba would be more stringently enforced. During his first term as president, Trump took a similar approach to Cuba, implementing a raft of additional sanctions.His administration has continued an economic embargo on Cuba, despite calls by international organisations including the United Nations to end it. The blockade was initially imposed in 1962 and has been in place ever since. ",

    "body": "16 hours agoHugh Schofield,Paris correspondentandKathryn ArmstrongTen people have been found guilty of cyber-bullying Brigitte Macron, the wife of French President Emmanuel Macron, by a Paris court. The defendants were accused of spreading false claims about her gender and sexuality, as well as making \"malicious remarks\" about the 24-year age gap between the couple. Most of the defendants were handed suspended prison sentences of up to eight months, but one was jailed immediately for failing to attend court. Some had their social media accounts suspended.The judge said the eight men and two women had acted with a clear desire to do harm to Brigitte Macron, making remarks online that were degrading and insulting.Two of the defendants - self-styled independent journalist Natacha Rey and internet fortune-teller Amandine Roy – were found guilty of slander in 2024 for claiming that France's first lady had never existed.They said her brother Jean-Michel Trogneux had changed gender and started using her name. They were later cleared on appeal. The argument used by the appeals court in clearing them was that saying someone had changed gender was not necessarily an \"attack on their honour\".  The Macrons are now taking that case to the high court of appeal.\"The most important things are the prevention courses and the suspension of some of the accounts\" of the perpetrators, Jean Ennochi, Brigitte Macron's lawyer, said after the verdict was handed down, the AFP news agency reported.Tiphaine Auzière, Brigitte Macron's daughter from a previous marriage, previously told the trial that the cyber-bullying had negatively affected her mother's health and living conditions.She said her mother \"has had to be careful about her choices of outfits, of posture... she knows perfectly well that her image will be used to back these theories\".While her mother had \"learned to live with it\", Auzière said, she suffered from the repercussions on her grandchildren who were taunted at school.Monday's ruling in France is a forerunner of a much bigger trial due in the US, where the Macrons have filed a defamation lawsuit against right-wing influencer Candace Owens, who has also voiced conspiracy theories about the first lady's gender. They alleged that she \"disregarded all credible evidence disproving her claim in favour of platforming known conspiracy theorists and proven defamers\".Owens has regularly repeated the claims on her podcast and social media channels, and in March 2024 stated that she would stake her \"entire professional reputation\" on her belief that the first lady \"is in fact a man\".The presidential couple were initially advised that the best course was to ignore the online gossip, because to go to law would simply amplify it.But last year there was a radical change of course. The Macrons decided that the scale of the online attacks was now too large to ignore. So, at risk of exposing their private selves in a US court, they determined to push back against the conspiracy theorists.A conspiracy theory claiming that Brigitte Macron is a transgender woman has circulated since her husband was first elected in 2017.Brigitte Macron first met her now-husband when she was a teacher at his secondary school.The couple married in 2007, when the future French president was 29 and she was in her mid-50s.",

    "body": "9 hours agoMadeline Halpertin court in New YorkThe sound of clanking leg shackles could be heard moments before Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro walked through the doorway of a New York City courtroom for the first time.He then told packed rows of reporters and the public that he had just been \"kidnapped\". Minutes after his entrance, the Judge Alvin Hellerstein asked Maduro to confirm his identity so the proceedings could start. \"I am, sir, Nicolás Maduro. I am president of the Republic of Venezuela and I am here kidnapped since January 3rd,\" he told the court in a calm Spanish before an interpreter translated for the court. \"I was captured at my home in Caracas, Venezuela.\" The 92-year-old judge quickly interjected to tell Maduro that there would be a \"time and a place to get into all of this\". During the dramatic 40-minute arraignment on Monday afternoon, Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, pleaded not guilty to drugs and weapon charges. \"I'm innocent. I'm a decent man,\" Maduro said, with Flores adding that she was \"completely innocent\". The 63-year-old and his wife were transferred to a New York jail after they were arrested by US forces at their compound in Venezuela on Saturday, as part of a surprise overnight operation that also saw strikes on military bases.Dressed in blue and orange jail shirts and khaki pants, the two wore headphones to listen to a Spanish translation during the hearing, an attorney sitting between them. Maduro took meticulous notes on a yellow legal pad that he asked a judge to confirm that he could keep with him after the hearing. When Maduro walked into the room - the same federal courtroom where Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was tried and convicted just months earlier - he turned around to nod at several members of the audience and greet them. He maintained this calm and expressionless demeanour during the proceedings, even at the end, when a man watching from the public area suddenly shouted that Maduro would \"pay\" for his crimes. \"I'm a president and prisoner of war,\" he shouted towards the man in the audience in Spanish. The man was then escorted out of the room in tears.The proceedings were emotional for others in the court as well. Maibort Petit, a reporter from Venezuela who has covered Maduro's administration, said the US missile strikes during Maduro's arrest damaged her family home near Fuerte Tiuna in Caracas.She said it was surreal to watch her former leader escorted into court in prison garb by US marshals. Maduro's wife, Flores, was much quieter, with bandages near her eyes and forehead for injuries her lawyers said she sustained during their weekend arrest. She spoke softly with her blonde hair tied back in a bun while her lawyers asked that she be given proper medical treatment, including an xray of potentially bruised ribs and a fracture.  Maduro and his wife did not seek bail during the proceedings, but can do so at a later date, meaning they will remain in federal custody. The US has accused Maduro of narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.Maduro was charged alongside his wife, son and several others. The next court hearing in the case has been scheduled for 17 March.",

    "body": "14 hours agoThomas Mackintosh'We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security,' Trump saysNick BeakeEurope correspondentDonald Trump has again proposed annexing Greenland, after Denmark's leader urged him to \"stop the threats\" over the island. Speaking to reporters, the US president said \"we need Greenland from the standpoint of national security\".Trump has repeatedly raised the prospect of the semi-autonomous Danish territory becoming an annexed part of the US, citing its strategic location for defence purposes and mineral wealth. Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen responded by saying \"that's enough now\" and described the notion of US control over the island as a \"fantasy\". He said: \"No more pressure. No more insinuations. No more fantasies of annexation. We are open to dialogue. We are open to discussions. But this must happen through the proper channels and with respect for international law.\"Earlier, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen had said \"the US has no right to annex any of the three nations in the Danish kingdom\".Frederiksen added that Denmark \"and thus Greenland\" was a Nato member and covered by the alliance's security guarantee, and said a defence agreement granting the US access to the island was already in place. The Danish prime minister released her statement after Katie Miller - the wife of one of Trump's senior aides, Stephen Miller - posted on social media a map of Greenland in the colours of the American flag alongside the word \"SOON\".The Danish ambassador to the US responded to the post by Miller - a right-wing podcaster and former aide to Trump during his first term - with a \"friendly reminder\" that the two countries were allies and saying Denmark expected respect for its territorial integrity.The back and forth over the future Greenland comes in the wake of a major military operation against Venezuela on Saturday, seizing its president Nicolás Maduro and his wife and removing them to New York.Trump later said the US would \"run\" Venezuela and US oil companies would \"start making money for the country\".The situation has reignited fears that the US may consider using force to secure control of Greenland, a vast island in the Arctic - something the US president has previously refused to rule out. Trump has claimed that making it part of the United States would serve American security interests due to its strategic location and its abundance of minerals critical to high-tech sectors. The Trump administration's recent move to appoint a special envoy to Greenland prompted anger in Denmark.Greenland, which has a population of 57,000 people, has had extensive self-government since 1979, though defence and foreign policy remain in Danish hands. While most Greenlanders favour eventual independence from Denmark, opinion polls show overwhelming opposition to becoming part of the US.In comments to the BBC, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said that only Denmark and Greenland could decide the territory's fate. \"Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark must decide the future of Greenland, and only Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark,\" he said.Separately, a representative for the European Union has rejected a claim by Trump that the EU \"needs\" the US to control the territory. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One at the weekend that \"the EU needs us to have [Greenland] and they know that.\"European Commission chief spokesperson Paula Pinho told the BBC that it was \"certainly not\" the EU's position, adding that she was unaware of any discussions with the US about the issue.More on this storyFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "7 hours agoWill GrantBBC's Mexico, Central America and Cuba correspondent, ColombiaEPA/ShutterstockCuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel addressed a rally in Havana in support of Venezuela, condemning Washington's operationAfter Venezuela, there is no nation in the Americas more affected by the events in Caracas than Cuba.The two nations have shared a political vision of state-led socialism since a fresh-faced Venezuelan presidential candidate, Hugo Chávez, met the aged leader of the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro, on the tarmac at Havana airport in 1999. For years, their mutual ties only deepened, as Venezuelan crude oil flowed to the communist-run island in exchange for Cuban doctors and medics travelling in the other direction.After the deaths of the two men, it was Nicolás Maduro - trained and instructed in Cuba - who became Chávez's handpicked successor, chosen partly because he was acceptable to the Castro brothers. He represented continuity for the Cuban revolution as much as the Venezuelan one.Now he, too, is gone from the seat of power in Caracas, forcibly removed by the US's  elite Delta Force team. The prospects for Cuba in his absence are bleak.For now, the Cuban government has robustly denounced the attack as illegal and declared two days of national mourning for 32 Cuban nationals killed in the US military operation. Their deaths revealed a key fact long-known about Cuban influence over the Venezuelan presidency and military: Maduro's security detail was almost entirely made up of Cuban bodyguards. Cuban nationals are in place in numerous positions in Venezuela's intelligence services and military too.Cuba had long denied having active soldiers or security agents inside Venezuela, but freed political prisoners have often claimed they were interrogated by men with Cuban accents while in custody.Furthermore, despite endless public proclamations of solidarity between the two nations, in truth the Cuban influence behind the scenes of the Venezuelan state is believed to have driven a wedge between ministers most-closely aligned with Havana and those who feel that the relationship first established by Chávez and Castro has become fundamentally unbalanced.In essence, that faction considers that these days Venezuela gets little in return for its oil.Venezuela is believed to send around 35,000 barrels of oil a day to Cuba - none of the island's other main energy partners, Russia and Mexico, even come close.Getty ImagesFood shortages have worsened in Cuba as it grapples with a severe economic crisisThe Trump administration's tactic of confiscating sanctioned Venezuelan oil tankers has already begun to worsen the fuel and electricity crisis in Cuba and has the potential to become very acute, very quickly.At best, the future looks increasingly complex for the beleaguered Caribbean island without Maduro at the helm in Caracas. Cuba was already in the grip of its worst economic crisis since the Cold War.There have been rolling blackouts from end to end of the island for months. And the impact on ordinary Cubans has been taxing in the extreme: weeks without reliable electricity, food rotting in fridges, fans and air-conditioning not running, mosquitoes swarming in the heat and the fester of uncollected rubbish.The island has experienced a widespread outbreak of mosquito-borne diseases in recent weeks with huge numbers of people affected by dengue fever and chikungunya. Cuba's healthcare system, once the jewel in the revolution's crown, has struggled to cope.It is not a pretty picture. Yet it is the daily reality for most Cubans.The idea that the flow of Venezuelan oil to Cuba could be turned off by Delcy Rodríguez fills Cubans with dread, especially if she looks to placate the Trump administration following the US raid against her predecessor and stave off the spectre of more violence.EPA/ShutterstockPresident Trump insists Washington is calling the shots in Venezuela now. While those comments were walked back - to an extent - by his Secretary of State Marco Rubio, there is no doubt that the Trump administration now expects nothing less than total compliance from Rodríguez as acting president. There would be further, potentially worse consequences, Trump threatened, if she \"doesn't behave\", as he put it.Such language - not to mention the US operation in Venezuela itself - has shocked and angered Washington's critics, who say the White House is guilty of the worst form of US imperialism and interventionism seen in Latin America since the Cold War. The removal of Maduro from power amounted to kidnapping, those critics argue, and the case against him must be thrown out at his eventual trial in New York.Unsurprisingly, Trump appears unfazed by such arguments, warning he might even carry it out again against the president of Colombia if need be. He has dubbed the worrying new circumstances in Latin America the \"Donroe Doctrine\", in a nod to the Monroe Doctrine - a 19th Century colonialist foreign policy principle which warned European powers against meddling in the US sphere of influence in the Western hemisphere.In order words, Latin America is the US's \"backyard\", and Washington has the unalienable right to determine what happens there. Rubio used that very term - backyard - about the region as he justified the actions against Venezuela on US Sunday talk shows.He also remains key to what comes next for Cuba. The US economic embargo has been in place for more than six decades and failed to remove the Castro brothers or their political project from power.Rubio - a Cuban American former Florida senator and son of Cuban exiles - would like nothing more than to be the man, or the man behind the man, who brought an end to 60 years of communist rule in his parents' homeland. He sees the strategy of removing Maduro and laying down stark conditions to a more-compliant Rodríguez government in Caracas as the key to achieving that self-professed goal in Havana.Cuba has faced tough times in the past, and the government remains defiant in the face of this latest act of US military intervention in the region. The 32 \"brave Cuban combatants\" who died in Venezuela would be honoured, said Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel, for \"taking on the terrorists in imperial uniforms\".\"Cuba is ready to fall,\" retorted Trump on Air Force One.",

    "body": "Venezuela swears in interim president after defiant Maduro pleads not guilty in US court 45 minutes agoMadeline Halpert,in court in New York andFiona NimoniDelcy Rodríguez was sworn in as Venezuela's interim president in a parliamentary session that began with demands for the release from US custody of ousted leader Nicolás Maduro.Rodríguez, 56, vice president since 2018, said she was pained by what she called the \"kidnapping\" of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who were seized by US forces in an overnight raid on Saturday.In a dramatic scene inside a New York court room two hours earlier, Maduro had insisted he was still president of Venezuela as he pleaded not guilty to four charges of drug trafficking and terrorism.Meanwhile the US faced sharp criticism at the UN, but the US ambassador responded that the largest energy reserves in the world could not be left in the hands of an illegitimate leader, a \"fugitive from justice\".Before the court appearance, the UN Security Council held an emergency session to discuss the situation in Venezuela. The ambassador for Venezuela, Samuel Moncada, said his country had been the target of an \"illegitimate armed attack lacking any legal justification\". The US ambassador to the UN, Mike Waltz, justified the attack by describing Maduro as \"an illegitimate so-called president\". Waltz added that the US had carried out a \"surgical law enforcement operation\" to apprehend Maduro, whom he also referred to as a \"fugitive from justice\". Maduro has been accused of narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.During Monday afternoon's court appearance, a member of the public began to yell in Spanish at Maduro that he would \"pay\" for what he had done.Maduro turned to him and replied that he was a \"kidnapped president\" and a \"prisoner of war\" before being escorted out in shackles behind his wife through the back court door.\"I'm a decent man. I am still president of my country,\" Maduro said earlier during the 30-minute hearing. Judge Alvin Hellerstein, 92, interjected to tell Maduro that there would be a \"time and a place to get into all of this\".Speaking just hours after Saturday's attack - which saw over 150 aircraft and 200 US personnel enter Venezuela - Trump vowed the US would \"run\"  Venezuela until \"a safe and proper and judicious transition\" was possible.Later on Monday, following a two-and-a half-hour classified briefing at the US Capitol, US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the US plan for running Venezuela was \"vague, based on wishful thinking, and was unsatisfying\".\"I did not receive any assurances that we would not try to do the same thing in other countries,\" he said.\"When the United States engages in this kind of regime change and so-called nation building, it always ends up hurting the United States.\" US Speaker of the House Mike Johnson denied the US was carrying out regime change, saying it was \"a demand for a change of behaviour by a regime\". Describing the operation as \"decisive and justified\", he said the US had \"always maintained the right to use force to defend our national interest, to preserve the safety of the American people and to prevent ongoing threats to its security\".\"We have a way of persuasion,\" Johnson said, \"because their oil exports, as you know, have been seized, and I think that will bring the country to a new governance in very short order.\"Trump has also promised US oil companies would move into the country to fix infrastructure \"and start making money for the country\".But despite the US president's claims, Maduro's allies remain in charge.In comments made to the US magazine The Atlantic on Sunday once it became clear Rodríguez would be sworn in, Trump warned she could \"pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro\" if she \"doesn't do what's right\".During a cabinet meeting, Rodríguez indicated her government would engage in some cooperation with the US, saying:  \"We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of co-operation orientated towards shared development within the framework of international law.\"Thousands of Venezuelans gathered outside the Federal Legislative Palace to show support for Maduro, his wife and the interim president Rodríguez as she was sworn in. Speaking after taking her oath, Rodríguez told the National Assembly she did so \"with pain\" because of the suffering caused by \"illegitimate military aggression\".She vowed to guarantee the peace of the country, \"the spiritual tranquillity of our people, the economic and social tranquillity of our people\".The assembly also heard from Maduro's son who expressed his support for his parents - saying that they \"will return\" to Venezuela.He also offered his \"unconditional support\" to Rodríguez.The next court hearing in Maduro's case has been scheduled for 17 March.",

    "body": "Selfies and smiles: South Korea seeks 'new phase' in ties with China2 hours agoJake Kwon,Seoul correspondentandKoh EweEPA/ShutterstockLee Jae Myung took a selfie with Xi Jinping during his visit to BeijingSouth Korea's President Lee Jae Myung has called for a \"new phase\" in ties with China as he met its leader Xi Jinping in Beijing on Monday.Regional security and lifting Beijing's unofficial ban on Korean pop culture is high on Lee's agenda, as he continues his four-day trip in China. He is set to meet China's Premier Li Qiang and the chairman of parliament, Zhao Leji on Tuesday.It marks the first visit by a South Korean leader since 2019. Bilateral ties had soured under Lee's predecessor, impeached ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol, who was very critical of China.Xi, meanwhile, has appeared keen to shore up ties with South Korea amid a diplomatic row between China and Japan.South Korea is a US security ally - like Japan - but also relies on China for trade. Experts say Lee is expected to keep walking a diplomatic tightrope between Beijing and Tokyo.The visit marks the second time the two leaders have met since November when Xi visited South Korea for a regional economic summit.On Monday Lee stated that the visit was \"a crucial opportunity\" for the \"full-scale restoration of South Korea-China relations\", reported South Korean newspaper Chosun. \"We want to usher in a new phase in the development of South Korea-China relations.\"Government officials and companies from both countries signed a series of cooperation agreements on technology, trade and environment.Lee also took selfies with Xi, using a Xiaomi phone that the Chinese president had gifted him last year. \"The image quality is certainly good, right?\" Lee posted on X along with the photos.Later, at a banquet for Lee in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, Xi urged the South Korean leader noted that the \"international situation is becoming more turbulent and complex\".The dinner followed the US's capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro over the weekend. Xi urged Lee to \"firmly stand on the right side of history and make correct strategic choices\", China's official Xinhua news agency reported.He also brought up the two countries' shared history of resisting Japan militarism, saying that China and South Korea should now \"work hand in hand to safeguard the outcomes of the victory of World War Two and uphold peace and stability in Northeast Asia\". Xi's eagerness to meet Lee signals the pressure he faces in finding a regional ally, Park Seung-chan, professor of China studies at Yongin University told the BBC.\"China may beat around the bush but its demand is clear: side with China and denounce Japan.\"During his four-day trip to China, Lee is expected to hold a memorial service in Shanghai for activists who fought for Korea's independence from Japan.But while South Korea is \"still showing all its deference towards China\", it wants to \"strengthen its relationships with both Japan and China\", Mr Park said.Lee is reportedly planning to visit Japan later this month to meet Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.The Japanese leader has come under fire from Beijing for suggesting in parliament that Tokyo could respond with its own self-defence forces in case of a Chinese attack on Taiwan, the self-governed island that China claims as its territory.X / Lee Jae MyungLee posted the selfie he took with Xi and their wives on XSecurity on the Korean Peninsula has also been part of the discussions.Lee has sought to engage North Korea diplomatically, but there has been little progress so far.He needs Chinese cooperation in pressuring the North's Kim Jong Un to give up his nuclear weapons. Beijing is one of Pyongyang's biggest supporters, economically and diplomatically.Lee vowed on Monday to work with China on \"viable alternatives for peace on the Korean Peninsula\".On Sunday Seoul's military said Pyongyang fired ballistic missiles off its east coast. And on Monday the North's state news agency said the country test-fired hypersonic missiles to assess deterrence capabilities following recent developments, in an apparent reference to the US's seizure of Maduro.It remains unclear how much Lee will be able to push China on North Korea. In September, Xi had pledged to strengthen Beijing's \"traditional friendship\" with Pyongyang.And Seoul and Beijing are not natural allies.US troops have been stationed in South Korea for decades in case of an attack from the North, and last year the two sides agreed to cooperate on building nuclear-powered submarines. The announcement drew warnings from China.Lee has also sought to put a stop to China's build-up of maritime structures in waters between the two countries. Beijing says the structures are fish-farming equipment, but they have sparked security concerns in Seoul.The two leaders agreed on Monday to continue \"constructive\" dialogue on the matter, South Korea's presidential spokesperson said.Another item high on Lee's agenda is China's unofficial restrictions on South Korean music and dramas that have been in place for a decade. K-pop and K-dramas are either unavailable or difficult to access on Chinese media platforms.While China has never acknowledged a ban on Korean artists, it's believed to be a protest against South Korea's decision to deploy a US anti-missile system in 2016, which China sees as a threat to its military operations in the region.China is a massive market for Korean entertainment, which is already a huge global success.                                                        At a Korea-China business forum on Sunday, Lee encouraged deeper bilateral collaboration in beauty products, food and cultural content including movies and music.South Korean presidential spokesperson said on Monday that the two leaders agreed to discuss the gradual expansion of cultural exchanges - without specifying concrete commitments on K-dramas or K-pop.Speaking before Korean residents in Beijing on Sunday, Lee said his visit would \"serve as a new starting point to fill in the gaps in Korea-China relations, restore them to normal and upgrade them to a new level\".",

    "body": "9 hours agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondentThe US seizing of Venezuela's leader has faced strong criticism from both America's friends and foes at an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council.Many member states agreed with the US that Nicolás Maduro had been an illegitimate and repressive leader. But many also condemned the US military action as a breach of international law and the UN Charter, and they demanded a democratic transition that reflected the will of the Venezuelan people.Among US allies, France was by far the most outspoken. The deputy ambassador, Jay Dharmadhikari, said Maduro's taking by the US runs \"counter to the principle of peaceful dispute resolution and runs counter to the principle of the non-use of force\".He told the Council: \"The proliferation of violations of the Charter of the UN and the violations of international law by states vested with responsibility as permanent members of Security Council chips away at the very foundation of the international order, contravening the principles of the charter, including the principle of respect for independence and territorial integrity of states, undermines the foundation of the UN and weakens international peace and security.\"The deputy UN ambassador for Denmark, Sandra Jensen Landi, voiced her country's \"deep concern\" at the evolving situation and said: \"These developments constitute a dangerous precedent. International law and the UN Charter… must be respected.\"Both these statements – by France and Denmark - represent a significant stiffening of European criticism of the seizing of Maduro after some initial equivocation by many EU members. In contrast, both UK and Greek diplomats at the UN did not condemn the US military operation.The ambassador for Panama, Eloy Alfaro de Alba, expressed concern about US plans to work with the existing regime, without involving the opposition or holding fresh elections. He told the Council: \"Any attempt to establish a permanent government headed by a figure from the repressive apparatus such as Delcy Rodriguez would constitute continuity of the system and not a genuine transition.\"Colombia's ambassador Leonor Zalabata Torres said there is no justification for the unilateral use of force to commit an act of aggression: \"Such actions constitute a serious violation of international law and the UN Charter.\"Russia's ambassador, Vassili Nebenzia, accused the US of \"international banditry\" and \"neo-colonialism and imperialism\". He said there was no justification for \"US domination by force\" and accused US allies of hypocrisy and double standards for failing to criticise Trump.China's Chargé d'Affaires, Sun Lei, said Beijing was \"deeply shocked and strongly condemned\" what he called the \"unilateral, illegal and bullying acts of the US\".In a statement read out on his behalf, Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary General, said he remained \"deeply concerned that rules of international law have not been respected\" during the US action: \"The power of the law must prevail.\"By contrast, the acting UK ambassador, James Kariuki, gave a very brief statement, saying merely the UK wanted to see a \"safe and peaceful transition to a legitimate government that reflects the will of the Venezuelan people\".He added, without being specific, that the UK \"reaffirms its commitment to international law and the principles enshrined in the charter of the UN\". Greece's deputy ambassador, Ioannis Stamatekos, also failed to condemn Trump's seizure of Maduro, calling instead for \"dialogue and diplomacy\" to resolve the crisis.For the US, UN ambassador Mike Waltz said the capture of Maduro was a law-enforcement operation against an illegitimate leader responsible for both drug trafficking and terrorism.\"You can't turn Venezuela into the operating hub for Iran, for Hezbollah, for gangs, for the Cuban intelligence agents and other malign actors that control that country,\" Waltz told the Council. \"You cannot continue to have the largest energy reserves in the world under the control of adversaries of the US.\"For many European countries, the seizing of Maduro has posed a difficult diplomatic dilemma. Some have been torn between defending fundamental principles of the UN charter that countries should not breach each other's sovereignty, or making a pragmatic, real politik decision not to anger the US on whose support and security they rely, especially for UkraineHence UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's refusal to say if the US attack on Venezuela was a breach of international law. He said merely that \"international law is the framework, is the anchor or the benchmark against which we judge the actions of all other governments. And it is, of course, for the US to justify the action that it has taken\".Likewise, the EU issued its own statement, saying that \"under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be upheld\" without saying whether that applied in this case. The EU considered Maduro illegitimate and his drug trafficking a \"significant security threat worldwide\" but the bloc said nothing about Trump's declaration that the US will now \"run\" the country.The French and Danish criticism now places them alongside Spain, which had been the only European country to voice concerns, with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez saying his government would \"not recognise an intervention that violates international law and pushes the region toward a horizon of uncertainty and belligerence\".The difficulty for other European leaders, fearful of upsetting Trump, is that they risk accusations of hypocrisy from other countries. For years, European powers have argued Russia's invasion of Ukraine should be opposed in part because it broke international rules about territorial integrity. Many developing countries rejected that argument, citing western military adventurism from Vietnam to Iraq. They will now add Venezuela to that list.The question is how Europe may respond in the longer term to America's military operation in Venezuela. Will it provide a catalyst for the continent to take greater responsibility for its own security in the face of so much instability from what many see as an unreliable ally? Donald Tusk, the prime minister of Poland, certainly hopes so, saying on social media: \"No-one will take seriously a weak and divided Europe: neither enemy nor ally. It is already clear now.\"We must finally believe in our own strength, we must continue to arm ourselves, we must stay united like never before. One for all, and all for one. Otherwise, we are finished.\"",

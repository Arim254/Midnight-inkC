    "body": "1 day agoYolande KnellMiddle East correspondent, JerusalemBBCItzik Gvili demands the return of his son Ran, the last dead hostage in Gaza, in Tel Aviv's Hostages SquareIn central Tel Aviv, the main stage has now been dismantled in Hostages Square, the focal point for the campaign over the past two years to bring back Israelis held in Gaza.Nearby, signs and posters have been taken down, and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum has vacated the offices that served as its nerve centre. Of the 251 hostages seized by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in the 7 October 2023 attacks, 168 have been brought back alive from Gaza, eight have been rescued. Only one deceased hostage, Ran Gvili, remains.With songs and prayers instead of mass rallies, the Gvili family and a small crowd of supporters assemble in Hostages Square each Friday to mark the start of the Jewish Sabbath; this week, a candle for the Hanukkah holiday was also lit. They are determined to bring back the young police officer who was killed by Hamas fighters after he rushed to help people being attacked in Kibbutz Alumim in southern Israel in October 2023.\"I feel every day is still the 7 October. We didn't pass the 7 October, but we are strong, and we're waiting for him. We do whatever we need,\" says Itzik Gvili, Ran's father. \"This gives us hope: the support of the people.\"ReutersThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum's slogan is: \"Bring them home now\"From the start, people power has been key to the hostage families. As its operations wind down, members of the Hostages Families Forum have been reflecting on its extraordinary evolution which turned the grassroots group into a powerful international lobbying force.In the terrible aftermath of the 2023 Hamas-led assault on southern Israel, which also killed some 1,200 people, a huge group of distraught relatives gathered for the first time in Tel Aviv desperately seeking answers about their missing loved ones. Because of the incoming rocket fire from Gaza, they met in an underground car park.\"We were together, shocked, and it fell on me that this is actually real, that now we are going to face this unbelievable challenge of understanding where all these people are, getting them home,\" recalls Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat had been snatched from Kibbutz Be'eri.\"And the second thing is that we're going to do this together. I'm not going to stand alone.\"ReutersGil Dickmann (2nd R) said the public support gave him hope after kidnapping of his cousin, Carmel GatThe formation of the new forum, with its slogan: \"Bring them home now\", gave the hostages' families a much-needed sense of regaining control.\"It was very, very powerful to feel that when the government and Israeli state, in a way collapsed in those very first few days after 7 October, it felt like nothing was working, what was working was Israeli society,\" Mr Dickmann says. \"So many wonderful people came to help. That brought me a lot of hope.\"Dividing its efforts between supporting the families - many of whom were bereaved and displaced from their homes following the attacks - and campaigning in Israel and around the world, the Hostages Families Forum worked with more than 10,000 volunteers. They included former Israeli diplomats, lawyers and security officials.Funded entirely by donations, it began to pay some staff, and a high-tech company loaned its central Tel Aviv office space.ReutersA makeshift tunnel symbolizing Hamas's tunnel network in Gaza was constructed at Hostages Square In November 2023 - more than six weeks into the brutal war in Gaza, which had by then killed more than 14,000 Palestinians according to the Hamas-run health ministry - Israel and Hamas agreed to a Qatar-mediated truce.This saw most women and children hostages returned in exchange for Israel releasing more than 240 Palestinian prisoners, all women and children. Hamas also freed some foreign nationals.But after a week, the fighting resumed with ferocity. About half of the hostages were left in Gaza. In December, three Israeli hostages were killed by Israeli soldiers in Gaza despite the fact they were shirtless, waving a makeshift white flag, and calling out in Hebrew.Israeli Prime Minister's Office/handout via ReutersItay Regev and his sister Maya were released during the November 2023 ceasefireThose were difficult days for the Hostages Families Forum and in early 2024, with polls suggesting more Israelis prioritised eliminating Hamas over the return of those still held captive, it brought in political strategist, Lior Chorev, as campaign manager.\"We were in deep war in Gaza, deep war in Lebanon, there was the Iranian threat, and it appeared that everything was stuck, and public opinion was against us,\" Mr Chorev explains.\"As a civil society organisation, we could not impact whether or not there's going to be a deal, but we could work hard on the Israeli public opinion to ensure that if a deal came into place, it would have a sound civilian majority within the country.\"ReutersGaza has been devastated by the two-year war sparked by 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attacks on IsraelAs well as Saturday evening demonstrations in the plaza in front of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, now renamed Hostages Square, there were near-daily actions by the Hostages Families Forum ranging from concerts and art installations to civil disruption. Media and diplomatic teams helped keep the hostages at the centre of attention.\"They kept going 24/7 for two years,\" comments Times of Israel political correspondent Tal Schneider who, like visiting foreign officials, often went to the forum's HQ. \"This place became like a foreign ministry for the country, for the families of 250 people.\"Looking back, Michael Levy says his intensive campaigning helped him deal with the \"emotional rollercoaster\" after his sister-in-law, Einav, was killed at the Nova Festival and his younger brother, Or, was taken hostage alive.\"The only thing that helped me was becoming active. I was interviewed all the time. I went with 15 different delegations to over 12 countries. I spoke to whoever was willing to listen and didn't want to stop and think,\" Mr Levy says.\"You need to stay optimistic all the time. You need to tell yourself every morning that today is going to be the day that he's going to be released, even though you know you are lying to yourself.\"ReutersMichael Levy's brother, Or, was released during the ceasefire that lasted from January to March 2025Although a hostage-prisoner exchange deal to end the war laid out in mid-2024 was described by then-US President Joe Biden as an Israeli proposal, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was widely seen as dragging out hostilities to aid his own political survival – a claim he rejected.Tensions rose between the Hostages Families Forum and Israel's government; there was open animosity from some government supporters.The situation worsened after a Netanyahu aide was accused of deliberately acquiring and illegally leaking a top-secret document to a German newspaper to influence how Israel's public viewed negotiations on a ceasefire and hostage deal. The document was misleadingly cast as suggesting that pressure on the prime minister played into the hands of Hamas.ReutersHundreds of people were killed or taken hostage at the Nova music festival during the 7 October 2023 attacksFor Mr Dickmann and Mr Levy, there was a low point when they headed to Washington for Netanyahu's address to a joint meeting of US Congress in July 2024 with other forum members.They showed off T-shirts saying \"Seal the deal\" during an ovation for the Israeli leader and were arrested for an unlawful demonstration. \"That was one of the moments in which I felt most alone,\" Mr Dickmann says. \"It was one of the most frightening things and it was while Carmel was still alive in captivity.\"The worst news came a month later when Carmel and five other hostages were killed by their Hamas captors, as the Israeli military closed in nearby.Mr Dickmann says it was only an \"unbelievable support group\" of younger forum members that helped him get through the ordeal.After the Israeli deaths were confirmed, angry protesters flooded the streets of Israeli cities. The forum puts the total number at 600,000.In Tel Aviv, a crowd of hostage families and their supporters marched with six prop coffins. A crowd gathered outside Israel's military headquarters and clashed with police on a major road.EPAThe killing of Carmel Gat and five other hostages by their Hamas captors sparked a huge protest in Tel AvivBy the start of 2025, international opposition to the devastating Gaza war had reached new heights as the number of Palestinians killed approached 48,000, according to Gaza's health ministry.In Israel, polls indicated a clear shift in Israeli public opinion, with a growing majority backing a hostage deal to end the war. With the election of a new US president, the Hostages Families Forum was increasingly directing its efforts stateside.\"They needed to bypass their own government,\" comments Ms Schneider.  \"The most important person for the job was obviously [US] President [Donald] Trump. There were signs written in English carried by the people and they would pack all their messages into a one-minute video, and they'd send it to him.\"Working with regional mediators, the US secured a new Gaza deal between Israel and Hamas in January 2025, just as Trump took office. The first stage brought back 33 hostages – eight of whom were dead – in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Five Thai hostages were also released.But in mid-March, Israel ended the ceasefire, resuming its heavy bombing of Gaza, without starting talks on the deal's second stage, which involved a full end to fighting and the return of the remaining hostages.The White HouseReleased hostages travelled to Washington to ask President Donald Trump to ensure the return of those left behind in GazaFrail and emaciated following his release in February under the ceasefire deal, Or Levy was emotionally reunited with his three-year-old son, his parents and brother Michael. However, Michael's joy was short-lived. He quickly resumed his campaigning with others in the Hostages Families Forum.\"I got what I wanted, I got my brother back, but I couldn't just stop,\" he says, \"I couldn't be happy because in those 491 days, they became my family. I almost felt I knew all the other hostages, that every hostage still there was part of my family.\"Newly freed hostages gave TV interviews saying they had been starved and beaten in captivity, sometimes in response to the ill-treatment of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Despite their trauma and fragile health, a few of the former hostages travelled to the White House urging President Trump to use his influence to bring back all the living and dead Israelis they had left behind in Gaza.ReutersEvyatar David was among the last 20 living hostages freed shortly after the current ceasefire began in OctoberThere were more dramatic moments.In September, an Israeli air strike unsuccessfully targeted the exiled Hamas leadership as it met in Qatar, a regional mediator, to discuss a new ceasefire proposal presented by the US.However, the ultimate effect was to push the Trump administration - backed up by its Arab allies – towards a new plan to end the war, which had by then killed more than 67,000 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry.Israel and Hamas agreed a ceasefire deal, under which all 20 living and 28 dead hostages still in Gaza would be handed over in return for almost 2,000 Palestinian detainees and prisoners in Israeli jails, as well as a surge in humanitarian aid and a partial Israeli withdrawal.ReutersIsrael released about 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees from Gaza in exchange for the living hostagesWhen Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, arrived in Israel just after the latest ceasefire started on 10 October, they were greeted by rapturous applause on stage in Hostages Square.On 13 October, the remaining living hostages came back.\"I'll never have a happier day in my life,\" says Mr Dickmann, remembering seeing his best friends reunited with their loved ones.Mr Chorev, the Hostage Families Forum's chief strategist, considers that long-held Jewish and Israeli traditions won through.\"This basic value of the Israeli theme that you don't leave anyone behind, that you're responsible for each and every Israeli held by the enemy, this was something that was unclear to certain elements in the Israeli government,\" he says. \"But it was very clear to the Israeli public.\"Tali (L) has been helping out hostages' families since the beginning of the warSlowly, 27 of the dead hostages' bodies have been returned to Israel over the past two months.Amid the ruins of Gaza, where health ministry officials say the number of Palestinians killed has risen to more than 70,000, Hamas operatives and the Red Cross have been searching for Ran Gvili's body east of Gaza City.Now, the last funds of the Hostages Families Forum are being used to support the Gvilis and a few dozen volunteers continue to head to Hostages Square on Fridays.\"We have been here in the rain and in nearly 50-degree [Celsius] heat, from winter to summer,\" says Tali, from Tel Aviv. \"Now that this is nearly over, I have mixed emotions. There is still one hostage who hasn't come back. I told myself I would stay until the last one.\"A symbolic tunnel, a large \"Hope\" sign and a piano put in the square in honour of now released hostage, Alon Ohel - a musician - have not yet been removed, nor has the giant countdown board which marks the days since 7 October 2023. A final mass rally is promised for when Ran Gvili's body is returned for burial.Itzik and Talik Gvili are determined to bring their son Ran home for a proper burial Israel's prime minister has never appeared in Hostages Square, but he has met with released hostages and hostage families, including those from a small, alternative group to the Hostages Families Forum, the Tikva Forum. The Gvilis belong to both.The family joined a candle-lighting ceremony on the first night of Hanukkah with Netanyahu.\"We will bring Ran back, just as we brought back 254 out of our 255 abductees,\" the prime minister said - counting two living and two deceased hostages held in Gaza before 2023.  \"Some did not believe. I believe. My friends in the government believed. They said: 'It will be a miracle.' I said: 'This nation performs miracles.'\"But in Israel, painful questions linger over why more hostages' lives were not saved.The Hostages Families Forum recently released harrowing Hamas videos recovered in Gaza which show the six hostages who were later murdered, including Carmel Gat, celebrating Hanukkah in a tunnel in 2023.The hostage crisis continues to cast a long shadow over Israeli society; even as many take heart from the families' message of endurance and solidarity.Additional reporting by Davide Ghiglione and Gidi Kleiman",

Ukraine has not commented.Investigators have been sent to the scene, in a car park near an apartment block in the south of Russia's capital.Images from the area show a badly damaged white car with the doors blown out, surrounded by other vehicles in a parking lot. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a number of military officials have been targeted in the Russian capital.Gen Yaroslav Moskalik was killed in a car bomb attack in Moscow in April, while Gen Igor Kirillov died in December 2024 when a device hidden in a scooter was detonated remotely.A Ukrainian source later told the BBC that Kirillov was killed by Ukraine's security service, though this was never confirmed on the record. As a matter of policy, Ukraine never officially admits or claims responsibility for targeted attacks.",

    "body": "US and Ukrainian envoys say \"productive and constructive\" talks have taken place in Miami, but there still appears to be no major breakthrough in efforts to end Ukraine's war with Russia.Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, issued a joint statement with the top Ukrainian negotiator, Rustem Umerov, after three days of meetings with European allies.The pair said the meeting focused on aligning positions on a 20-point plan, a \"multilateral security guarantee framework\", a \"US Security guarantee framework for Ukraine\" and an \"economic & prosperity plan\". Separate talks have been taking place in Miami between the US and the Russian envoy, Kirill Dmitriev.\"Our shared priority is to stop the killing, ensure guaranteed security, and create conditions for Ukraine's recovery, stability, and long-term prosperity,\" Witkoff and Umerov said in a statement.The meetings are the latest step in weeks of diplomatic activity, sparked by the leaking of a 28-point US peace plan which shocked Ukraine and its European allies for appearing to favour Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago.Witkoff said representatives from Russia had met himself and other US officials in southern Florida, including Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.Witkoff said the meetings with Russian envoy Dmitriev were also \"productive and constructive\" and that \"Russia remains fully committed to achieving peace in Ukraine\". Trump has been pushing Ukraine and Russia to come to an agreement on ending the war, but so far the two countries have been unable to agree on major issues, including Moscow's demand to keep land it has already seized.US intelligence reports continue to warn that Russian President Vladimir Putin still wants to capture all of Ukraine and reclaim parts of Europe that belonged to the former Soviet empire, six sources familiar with US intelligence told the Reuters news agency.This comes says after Putin told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg that there will be no more wars after Ukraine, if Russia is treated with respect.\"There won't be any operations if you treat us with respect, if you respect our interests just as we've always tried to respect yours,\" he said.Meanwhile, a Ukrainian drone attack damaged two vessels and two piers in Russia's southern Krasnodar region, Russian officials said on Monday. The damage led to a big fire, but Russian authorities say all crew were safely evacuated.  Some reports say oil infrastructure was targeted.",

    "body": "6 hours agoAbu Bakar YasinandNaomi Clarke,BBC NewsbeatGetty ImagesThe Fulham midfielder will represent his home country Nigeria in the competitionHe's played on some of the biggest stages in the world in the Premier League, but Alex Iwobi believes the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) is a \"special\" experience. The tournament will see 24 teams battling for the continental crown across the next couple of weeks. Fulham midfielder Iwobi will represent his home country of Nigeria in the competition, where they will be hoping to clinch the title after missing out in a 2-1 loss to Ivory Coast in 2023's final.\"With Afcon, you get to celebrate Africa through football,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat. \"You get to see different cultures, you get to see how different people dress, how people from Nigeria, the way we walk into the changing rooms.\"When some of the other countries walk into the changing rooms, we play music, so we're celebrating our music through that as well.\"Nigeria will be hoping to redeem themselves after failing to qualify for a second successive World Cup. Iwobi says it was a \"big disappointment\", but the team will be using it to fuel them in the Afcon tournament.\"We owe it to ourselves to make it right, and there's no better way from the last Afcon to improve (than) just to win this one,\" the 29-year-old says. Afcon is typically held every two years and this time Morocco is hosting. Nigeria have won the competition three times over the years, the last being back in 2013. Their most recent loss to Ivory Coast is still prominent in Iwobi's mind as he says it \"shattered\" their dreams. However, he feels the moment was \"written\" for striker Sébastien Haller, who scored the winning goal after overcoming testicular cancer. \"It was a tough loss, but you give credit when credit due, they deserved it,\" Iwobi says.\"But it's also fuelled us and we've been working hard to get into the Afcon again and, hopefully, this is our story.\"Getty ImagesAlex Iwobi made his debut for Nigeria's national team in 2015The Fulham midfielder was born in Lagos, but moved to London as a child. His talent was spotted early and he was selected to represent England up to under-18 level.After many years with the Three Lions, he made his debut for Nigeria's national team in 2015 as he says he felt more \"at home\" with the team.\"England treated me with a lot of respect and they loved me,\" he says. \"But at the same time, I felt more of a connection with my roots in Nigeria.\"He has since made 91 appearances, making him the fourth most capped player for the Nigerian Super Eagles. Iwobi says he never thought he would play for Arsenal, Fulham, or Nigeria growing up, but he is \"honoured and grateful\" for his achievements. Ademola Lookman, Calvin Bassey and Iwobi's school friend Ola Aina are also among the players on the Nigerian national team who were not raised in the country.They have been affectionately nicknamed the \"innit boys\", and Iwobi hopes they have helped open the door for others to represent their home country. \"You're Nigerian at the end of the day and you will get loved regardless,\" he says.Getty ImagesIwobi says he never thought we would play for Arsenal, Fulham, or Nigeria in his careerThere has been debate over whether Afcon gets the respect it deserves.Earlier this year, Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher caused a stir when he suggested Afcon was not considered a \"major tournament\", when discussing Mohamed Salah's chances of winning the coveted Ballon d'Or.Iwobi feels there is still more work to be done.\"It's obviously getting recognised a lot more,\" he says. \"There's a lot of great talents, great nations representing.\"In the Premier League there's a lot of players in each team that are going to be represented so the awareness is growing, but it definitely deserves a lot more respect, in my opinion.\"If he wins the tournament, the Fulham player says he will be on the phone to his parents and sister straight away, while his extended family will be dancing.\"I've heard from previous people that when they win it, it's like everything just stops, you become like a king, you're just royalty,\" he says. \"Just going to the final we got treated like royalty anyway, so I can't imagine winning it.\"It would just be crazy, but I want to experience that.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "3 hours agoHelen LivingstoneSydneySuppliedA screenshot from a video found on Naveed Akram's phone shows his father conducting firearms training, police allege The gunmen who allegedly carried out a deadly attack on a Jewish festival at Bondi Beach last week threw four undetonated explosives at the start of the attack, including a \"tennis ball bomb\", according to newly released documents.Naveed Akram, 24, has been charged with dozens of offences including 15 counts of murder over the attack at a Hanukkah celebration on 14 December. Akram, who was shot by police during the attack, was released from hospital on Monday and transferred to a prison.The second alleged gunman, his father Sajid Akram, was shot dead.The pair recorded a video manifesto in October in which they sit in front of the Islamic State group flag, according to police documents.SuppliedA screenshot from CCTV shows the Akrams carrying 'bulky items' hours before the attacks, police allegeThe Akrams \"meticulously planned this terrorist attack for many months\", police alleged. Videos found on Naveed's phone showed the pair were motivated by \"violent extremist ideology\" linked to the Islamic State group.They include one video in which the pair sit in front of an Islamic State flag and detail their motivation for the Bondi attack and condemn \"the acts of 'Zionists'\", police alleged. Naveed also appears to recite a passage from the Quran in Arabic in the video, police alleged.Another video allegedly showed the pair conducting firearms training in what police believe to be rural New South Wales in October. \"The Accused and his father are seen throughout the video firing shotguns and moving in a tactical manner,\" police alleged.A temporary suppression order had been made on the fact sheet last week to protect the identities of the survivors of the attack. The order was revoked on Monday after an application to the New South Wales Local Court by media companies although the names of most survivors were redacted. SuppliedCCTV shows the Akrams carrying out reconnaissance two days ahead of the Bondi Beach attack, police allegeCCTV recorded at Bondi beach two days ahead of the attack also showed the Akrams driving to the area and carrying out reconnaissance, police alleged. \"The Accused and his father, S Akram, are seen to exit the vehicle and walk along the footbridge, being the same position where they attended two days later and shot at members of the public,\" police wrote. CCTV also captured the pair leaving rented accommodation in the Sydney suburb of Campsie hours before the attack \"carrying long and bulky items wrapped in blankets\", police alleged.Police said the items, which were placed in a car, were three firearms, home-made improvised explosive devices including the \"tennis ball bomb\" and two Islamic State flags.They later drove to Bondi where they parked and placed the flags on the inside of the front and rear windows, police alleged. After removing the firearms and homemade bombs from the car, they walked towards the footbridge from where they carried out their attack, police alleged.Three homemade pipe bombs and the tennis ball bomb were thrown as they approached the bridge, police alleged, but did not explode although they were assessed as \"viable\". A fifth explosive device was later found in their vehicle, police had previously said.Naveed Akram, who was shot in the abdomen and critically injured by police, did not appear at Monday's court appearing. SuppliedPolice allege a homemade bomb was found in the boot of the Akrams' vehicle",

    "body": "South East Asia's top diplomats met on Monday in Malaysia in a bid to end deadly border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia that have killed at least 41 people and displaced close to one million others.They were seeking to revive a ceasefire that was brokered in July by Malaysia as chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and US President Donald Trump in July.This was the first meeting between officials of Thailand and Cambodia since fighting resumed on 8 December. Both countries have blamed each other for the fresh hostilities.The conflict dates back more than a century, when the borders of the two nations were drawn after the French occupation of Cambodia.Speaking after the meeting, Thailand's Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow said a meeting between military officials from both Thailand and Cambodia would take place on 24 December, and that this would need to happen before any ceasefire agreement could be reached. The most recent fighting has seen the exchange of artillery fire along the 800km (500-mile) border. Thailand has also launched air strikes targetting Cambodian positions.The conflict has been the worst between Asean member states since the association was founded in 1967. The failure to contain it represents a serious blow to the bloc's credibility.In his opening remarks on Monday, Malaysia's foreign minister had asked both sides and other Asean members to give the matter \"our most urgent attention\".\"We must consider the wider ramifications of the continued escalation of the situation for the people we serve,\" Mohamad Hasan told his counterparts, according to news agency AFP.Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who presided over the signing of the July ceasefire alongside Trump, had earlier said he was \"cautiously optimistic\" about Monday's meeting in Kuala Lumpur.\"Our duty is to present the facts, but more importantly, to press upon them that it is imperative for them to secure peace,\" he said last week.Cambodia has said that the talks aim to restore \"peace, stability and good neighbourly relations\", adding that it would reaffirm its position that the disputes should be resolved through peaceful means.Thailand, while calling the meeting an important opportunity, reiterated its conditions for negotiations, including a declaration of ceasefire from Cambodia first and a \"genuine and sustained\" ceasefire.The US and China have also been attempting to mediate a new ceasefire.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who had a phone call with his Thai counterpart on Thursday, said that he hoped a new ceasefire could be reached by Monday or Tuesday. China's special envoy for Asian affairs, Deng Xijun, visited Phnom Penh last week. A statement from Beijing said he reaffirmed that China would continue to play a constructive role in facilitating dialogue between Cambodia and Thailand.On Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at the daily press briefing that China had been mediating the confict in its own way since fighting restarted this month. He added that Beijing would release information on the mediation conducted by Deng \"in due course\".Additional reporting by Jonathan Head and Thanyarat Doksone",

    "body": "The US Coast Guard is in \"active pursuit\" of another vessel in international waters near Venezuela as tensions in the region continue to escalate.US authorities have already seized two oil tankers this month - one of them on Saturday. Sunday's pursuit related to a \"sanctioned dark fleet vessel that is part of Venezuela's illegal sanctions evasion\", a US official told the BBC's partner CBS News. \"It is flying a false flag and under a judicial seizure order.\"Washington has accused Venezuela of using oil money to fund drug-related crime, while Venezuela has described the tanker seizures as \"theft and kidnapping\".US President Donald Trump last week ordered a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving the country.Venezuela - home to the world largest proven oil reserves - has accused the Trump administration of trying to steal its resources. US authorities have not yet officially confirmed Sunday's pursuit, and the exact location and name of the tanker involved is not yet known. As of last week, more than 30 of the 80 ships in Venezuelan waters or approaching the country were under US sanctions, according to data compiled by TankerTrackers.com.Saturday's seizure saw a Panamanian-flagged tanker boarded by a specialised tactical team in international waters. That ship is not on the US Treasury's list of sanctioned vessels, but the US has said it was carrying \"sanctioned PDVSA oil\". In the past five years the ship also sailed under the flags of Greece and Liberia, according to records seen by BBC Verify.\"These acts will not go unpunished,\" the Venezuelan government said in response to Saturday's incident. It added that it intended to file a complaint with the United Nations Security Council and \"other multilateral agencies and the governments of the world\".Venezuela is highly dependent on revenues from its oil exports to finance its government spending.In recent weeks, the US has built up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea and has carried out deadly strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug-smuggling boats, killing around 100 people.Sanctions also were placed on some of President Maduro's relatives and on businesses associated with what the US calls his illegitimate regime.Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Friday: \"It is clear that the current status quo with the Venezuelan regime is intolerable for the United States.\"He added that the goal of the Trump administration is to change that dynamic.  His comments were criticised by Venezuela's foreign minister who accused Rubio dragging the US down the path of \"regime changes\". It has provided no public evidence that these vessels were carrying drugs, and the military has come under increasing scrutiny from Congress over the strikes.The Trump administration has accused Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro of leading a designated-terrorist organisation called Cartel de los Soles, which he denies.",

    "body": "In rebel-held Myanmar, civilians face devastating air strikes and a sham election10 hours agoYogita LimayeSouth Asia and Afghanistan correspondent in MyanmarAamir Peerzada/BBCIang Za Kim had to flee her home after the junta launched air strikes nearbyLate one night last month Iang Za Kim heard explosions in a neighbouring village, then fighter jets flying overhead. She ran out of her home to see smoke rising from a distance.\"We were terrified. We thought the junta's planes would bomb us too. So we grabbed what we could – some food and clothes and ran into the jungles surrounding our village.\"Iang's face quivers as she recounts the story of what happened on 26 November in K-Haimual, her village in Myanmar's western Chin State, and then she breaks down.She's among thousands of civilians who've fled their homes in recent weeks after the Burmese military launched a fierce campaign of air strikes, and a ground offensive in rebel-held areas across the country, to recapture territory ahead of elections starting on 28 December.Four other women sitting around her on straw mats also start crying. The trauma of what they've gone through to make it to safety is clearly visible.While the air strikes were the immediate cause for Iang to flee, she also doesn't want to be forced to participate in the election.\"If we are caught and refuse to vote, they will put us in jail and torture us. We've run away so that we don't have to vote,\" she says.Aamir Peerzada/BBCMany civilians have crossed into India to escape the violence in MyanmarSome from Chin state have described the junta's latest offensive as the fiercest it has launched in more than three years.Many of the displaced have sought refuge in other parts of the state. Iang is among a group that crossed the border into India's Mizoram state. Currently sheltered in a rundown badminton court in Vaphai village, the group's few belongings they were able to carry are packed in plastic sacks.Indian villagers have given them food and basic supplies.Ral Uk Thang has had to flee his home at the age of 80, living in makeshift shelters in jungles for days, before finally making it to safety.\"We're afraid of our own government. They are extremely cruel. Their military has come into our and other villages in the past, they've arrested people, tortured them, and burned down homes,\" he says.It isn't easy to speak to Burmese civilians freely. Myanmar's military government does not allow free access in the country for foreign journalists. It took over the country in a coup in February 2021, shortly after the last election, and has since been widely condemned for running a repressive regime that has indiscriminately targeted civilians as it looks to crush the armed uprising against it across Myanmar.During its latest offensive, the junta last week targeted a hospital in Rakhine State, just south of Chin State. Rebel groups in Rakhine say at least 30 people were killed and more than 70 injured.The Chin Human Rights Organisation says that since mid-September at least three schools and six churches in Chin State have been targeted by junta airstrikes, killing 12 people including six children.The BBC has independently verified the bombing of a school in Vanha village on 13 October. Two students –Johan Phun Lian Cung, who was seven, and Zing Cer Mawi, 12 - were killed as they were attending lessons. The bombs ripped through their classrooms injuring more than a dozen other students.Myanmar's military government did not respond to the BBC's questions about the allegations.This is the second time Bawi Nei Lian and his young family – a wife and two young children - have been displaced. Back in 2021, soon after the coup, their home in Falam town was burnt down in an air strike. They rebuilt their lives in K-Haimual village. Now they're homeless again.\"I can't find the words to explain how painful and hard it is and what a difficult decision it was to make to leave. But we had to do it to stay alive,\" he says.\"I want the world to know that what the military is claiming – that this election is free and fair – this is absolutely false. When the main political party is not being allowed to contest the election, how can there be genuine democracy?\"Aamir Peerzada/BBCBawi Nei Lian (left) says the scheduled elections are a shamThe National League for Democracy party, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, which won landslides in the two elections prior to the coup, will not be contesting as most of its senior leaders including  Suu Kyi are in jail.\"We don't want the election. Because the military does not know how to govern our country. They only work for the benefit of their high-ranking leaders. When Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's party was in power, we experienced a bit of democracy. But now all we do is cry and shed tears,\" says Ral Uk Thang.Iang Za Kim believes the election will be rigged. \"If we voted for a party not allied with the military, I believe they will steal our votes and claim we voted for them.\"The election will take place in phases, with a result expected around the end of January. Rebel groups have called it a sham.At the base of the Chin National Front in Myanmar, the most prominent rebel group operating in the state, the group's Vice Chairman Sui Khar says: \"This election is only being held to prolong military dictatorship. It's not about the people's choice. And in Chin State, they hardly control much area, so how can they hold an election?\"He points out the areas where the most intense fighting is ongoing on a map and tells us nearly 50 rebel fighters have been injured in just the past month. There have been deaths too, but so far the groups have not released a number.\"There are columns of hundreds of soldiers trying to advance into the northern part of Chin state from four directions,\" Sui Khar says. \"The soldiers are being supported by air strikes, artillery fire and by drone units.\"Aamir Peerzada/BBCAbel lost his right leg and his hands were severely wounded fighting against the juntaAccess to the base is extremely rare. Set amid thickly forested mountains, it is the heart of the resistance against the junta in Chin state.Sui Khar takes us to the hospital at the base. We see a group of injured fighters who were brought in overnight and had to undergo hours of surgery. Some of them have had to undergo amputations.Many of them were just schoolboys when the coup occurred in 2021. Just about adults now, they've let go of their dreams to fight on the frontline against the junta.Abel, 18, is in too much pain to speak. He was with a group of fighters trying to take back territory the junta captured a week ago. They won the battle, but Abel lost his right leg and has serious injuries to his hands as well.In a bed next to him is Si Si Maung, 19, who's also had a leg amputated.\"As the enemy was retreating we ran forward and I stepped on a landmine. We were injured in the explosion. Then we were attacked from the air. The airstrikes make things very difficult for us,\" he says. \"I've lost a leg, but even if I've to give up my life I'm happy to make the sacrifice so that future generations have a better life.\"The impact of the ferocity of the latest offensive is visible in room after room at the hospital.Yet, it's the support and grit of tens of thousands of youngsters like Si Si Maung, who picked up arms to fight against the junta, that have helped the rebels make rapid advances against a much more powerful rival in the past four-and-a-half years.Some like 80-year-old Ral Uk Thang hope that after the election, the junta will retreat, and he will be able to go back home.\"But I don't think I will live to see democracy restored in Myanmar,\" he says. \"I hope my children and grandchildren can witness it some day.\"Additional reporting by Aamir Peerzada, Sanjay Ganguly and Aakriti Thapar",

    "body": "18 hours agoShaimaa Khalil,JerusalemandMallory MoenchIsrael's security cabinet has approved the recognition of 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank as the government continues its settlement expansion push.Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a settler who proposed the move alongside Defence Minister Israel Katz, said the decision was about blocking the establishment of a Palestinian state. Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are considered illegal under international law. Saudi Arabia condemned the move. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said Israel's \"relentless\" settlement expansion fuels tensions, restricts Palestinian access to land, and threatens the viability of a sovereign Palestinian state. Violence in the occupied West Bank has surged since the war in Gaza began in October 2023, further heightening fears that settlement expansion could entrench Israel's occupation and undermine a two-state solution.The two-state solution refers to the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital, broadly along the lines that existed prior to the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.Since taking office in 2022, the current Israeli government has significantly increased the approval of new settlements and begun the legalisation process for unauthorised outposts, recognising them as \"neighbourhoods\" of existing settlements.The most recent decision brings the total number of settlements approved over the past three years to 69, according to Smotrich.The approvals come just days after the United Nations said settlement expansion had reached its highest level since 2017. The latest approvals include the re-establishment of two settlements — Ganim and Kadim — which were dismantled nearly 20 years ago.In May, Israel approved 22 new settlements in the occupied West Bank - the biggest expansion in decades.The Israeli government also approved plans in August to build more than 3,000 homes in the so-called E1 project between Jerusalem and the Maale Adumim settlement, which had been frozen for decades amid fierce opposition internationally.Smotrich at the time said the plan would \"bury the idea of a Palestinian state\".About 700,000 settlers live in approximately 160 settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, according to Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now. It is land Palestinians seek for a future independent state.Settlement expansion has angered Arab nations who have consistently said it undermines prospects for a two-state solution. It has also raised concerns about the possible annexing of the occupied West Bank.US President Donald Trump had warned Israel about such a move, telling TIME magazine that Israel would lose all its support from the US if it happened.In September, the UK - along with other countries including Australia and Canada - recognised a Palestinian state, a significant although symbolic change in government policy.Israel opposed the move, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying a Palestinian state \"will not happen\".",

    "body": "Just nowClaire Keenan,Elettra NeysmithandAbayomi Adisa,BBC Africa, LagosNigerian authorities say they have secured the release of the remaining 130 schoolchildren and teachers kidnapped from a Catholic boarding school in the country's central Niger state.Nigeria's federal government described the latest release as a \"moment of triumph and relief\", after one of the country's worst mass kidnappings.More than 250 children and staff were abducted from St Mary's Catholic school in Papiri on 21 November. Earlier this month about 100 of the children were released.The authorities confirmed \"the rescue of the remaining 130 children and staff\" in a statement, saying \"not a single pupil is left in captivity\".Niger state police chief Adamu Abdullahi Elleman told the BBC that they were being \"examined by security forces and will be taken to their school tomorrow [Monday] to reunite with their families\".Bishop Bulus Dauwa Yohanna, who is in charge of the school as the Catholic cleric who heads the region, also confirmed the development.He said the local governor had informed him of the release of the remaining schoolchildren and teachers, and \"asked me to come and receive them\".Parents are in high spirits over the news of the release, Abdullahi Rofia, a local emergency worker in Papiri where the school is located, told the BBC. The parents are expected to gather at the school later in the day.On Sunday, presidential spokesperson Bayo Onanuga said the total of freed students was now 230.Since the kidnapping, the exact number of people taken and how many have remained in captivity has been unclear.On 8 December, authorities secured the release of 99 children and one teacher, reportedly leaving at least 165 others with the kidnappers.However, the Niger state police chief told the BBC that the 130 who have now been released account for all the remaining abductees, faulting the initial figures released by the school management.It has not been formally made public how the government secured the latest release - or whether any ransom was paid.The announcement by Onanuga included pictures of children smiling and waving. The students are expected to arrive in the Niger state capital, Minna, on Monday.When the earlier release happened the governor of neighbouring Nasarawa state, Abdullahi Sule, told local media that the federal government had played a key role, adding that the behind-the-scenes efforts could not be disclosed for security reasons.The Christian Association of Nigeria reported that 50 students managed to escape at the time of the kidnapping.November's abduction was the latest incident in a number of targeted attacks on schools and places of worship in north and central Nigeria.The attack on St Mary's was preceded by mass kidnappings just days earlier.On 18 November, two people were killed and 38 abducted in an attack on the Christ Apostolic Church in Kwara state, and a day before that, two were killed and 25 Muslim students abducted from Government Girls' Secondary School in Kebbi state.All those taken in the Kwara and Kebbi attacks have since been freed.It is not clear who is behind these kidnappings - most analysts believe they are carried out by criminal gangs seeking ransom payments.On 9 December Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu said his government would continue to work with Niger and other states \"to secure our schools and make the learning environment safer and more conducive for our younger ones\".",

    "body": "17 hours agoJaroslav LukivandMayeni Jones,JohannesburgA manhunt is under way after a shooting at a tavern in South Africa left nine people dead and another 10 injured. Police said seven men and two women were killed in Bekkersdal, near Johannesburg, after about 12 unidentified gunmen arrived in two vehicles and opened fire at patrons. The shooting happened at about 01:00 local time on Sunday (23:00 GMT Saturday) and the perpetrators \"continued to shoot randomly as [people] fled the scene\", police added. South Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world. Sixty-three people were killed every day on average between April and September this year, according to police figures. Murders are often the result of arguments, robberies and gang violence. The motive for this attack is not clear.At the scene, deputy provincial police commissioner Maj-Gen Fred Kekana told  broadcaster Newzroom Afrika that the perpetrators, armed with pistols and one AK-47, were \"unprovoked\".\"The poor patrons were just enjoying themselves when people came and shot,\" he said. Two of the victims were shot outside the tavern as they tried to flee and a third was a taxi driver who had dropped off a passenger nearby, Maj-Gen Kekana added.Resident Nokuthula Bhukwana went to the tavern after she heard the shooting. \"When we arrived at the scene, we opened the doors and indeed scores of people were lying on the floor,\" she told the Reuters news agency.\"We rushed around and others were calling the police, and we also called the ambulance and they arrived. We had to carry some of the injured people using wheelbarrows to the clinic.\"Speaking to Newzroom Afrika, one resident described how gunfire had become a normal thing at night in Bekkersdal.\"Criminals, they do as they please here,\" the unnamed man said. \"These guns, they sound each and every evening... as soon as it's dusk we know that gunshots are about to sound and they will sound severely.\"It is terrorising our communities.\"Interviewed at the scene, deputy mayor for the local municipality Nontombi Molatlhegi said that locals were afraid of speaking out and identifying those responsible.She said that the police were under-resourced, and too thinly spread, and called for the military to get involved in protecting residents.\"We are crying, as well as the city political leadership, for the intervention of the national government to release [the army] so that they can be able to come in this space\" and be visible.There are about three million legally held firearms in South Africa, but there are at least the same number of unlicensed weapons in circulation in the country, which has a population of 63 million, according to statistics cited by Gideon Joubert from the South African Gunowners' Association.Earlier this month, at least 11 people - including a child - were shot dead at a hostel near Pretoria.There has been a significant increase in mass shootings - where four or more people are either killed or injured - since 2020, Claire Taylor, a researcher at campaign group Gun Free South Africa, told the BBC.Looking at media reports from 2024 her organisation recorded 80 such incidents, which was up from 71 the previous year. There has, however, been a decline in reported mass shootings in 2025.Among the most common locations are licensed taverns, such as in Bekkersdal this weekend, or illegal drinking spots, known locally as shebeens, which was the case in the 6 December killings.Additional reporting by Damian Zane",

    "body": "2 days agoSteve RosenbergBBC Russia Editor, MoscowReporters ask world leaders questions all the time.No big deal. Right?But what's it like putting a question to Vladimir Putin - the president who ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the leader whose country was accused this week by the head of MI6 of \"the export of chaos\"?And imagine asking that question live on TV while millions of Russians are watching.It's a big responsibility. You don't want to mess up.\"My question is about Russia's future. What kind of future are you planning for your country and your people?\" I ask President Putin.\"Will the future be like the present, with any public objection to the official line punishable by law?  Will the hunt for enemies at home and abroad be accelerated? Will mobile internet outages become even more common? Will there be new 'special military operations'?\"While I'm speaking, Vladimir Putin is making notes. And then replies.He defends Russia's repressive foreign agent law. Hundreds of Russians who are critical of the authorities have been designated \"foreign agents\".\"We didn't invent it,\" Putin tells me. \"This [foreign agent] law was adopted in a string of Western countries, including in America in the 1930s. And all these laws, including the US one, are much tougher…\"In reality, the Russian law is draconian. It excludes \"foreign agents\" from many aspects of public life, including teaching, the civil service, elections and public events. It imposes financial and property restrictions. Criminal prosecution can follow a single administrative fine.However, I'm unable to point this out to President Putin. The microphone was taken away from me after I'd finished my question.Suddenly the moderator intervenes to change the subject.\"There's another question here: 'What's going to happen to the BBC? It's facing a multi-billion lawsuit from the US president?',\" says anchor Pavel Zarubin.\"I think President Trump is right,\" President Putin confirms.The Kremlin and the White House seeing eye to eye… on the BBC.Putin returns to my question.\"Will there be new special military operations? There won't be, if you treat us with respect, and respect our interests, just as we've always tried to do with you. Unless you cheat us, like you did with Nato's eastward expansion.\"Visible for all to see is what is driving Vladimir Putin - a deep-seated resentment of the West. He argues that, for years, Western leaders have disrespected, deceived and lied to Russia - and that they're lying still by claiming that Moscow intends to attack Europe. \"What kind of rubbish is that?\" declares the Kremlin leader.But many European leaders simply don't trust Moscow. In the run-up to the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian officials denied they had plans for a mass attack.More recently Russia has been accused of violating European air space with fighter jets and drones, as well as of carrying out cyber-attacks and acts of sabotage.But as he finished answering my question, was this an olive branch to Europe from Russia's president?\"We're ready to cease hostilities immediately provided that Russia's medium- and long-term security is ensured, and we are ready to co-operate with you.\"However, if Moscow continues to connect its long-term security to its maximalist demands over Ukraine, European leaders will remain sceptical.",

    "body": "8 hours agoEve WebsterBristol, VirginiaBBCThe US town of Bristol, population around 44,000, is a divided community.Split between Virginia and Tennessee, the state line runs literally down main street. While both sides have much in common, there is one major difference - abortion is illegal in Tennessee. This has been the case since the 2022 Supreme Court ruling which gave individual states, rather than the federal government, the power to legislate abortion, triggering 12 states to pass near-total bans.So the city's only abortion clinic, Bristol Women's Health, moved less than a mile down the road to continue practising legally in Virginia.But just because abortion is legal in Virginia it doesn't mean the battle for abortion access is over.\"It's like whack-a-mole,\" said Barbara Schwartz, the co-founder of SLAAP, the State Line Abortion Access Partnership. They assist people travelling into Virginia to get an abortion at Bristol Women's Health Clinic.\"As soon as one approach doesn't work, the anti-abortion crowd pops up in Bristol and tries another.\"Barbara Schwartz (on right) with other volunteers at the clinicOn 22 December, Bristol's Circuit Court will hear the clinic's case against an eviction notice served by their landlords, brothers Chase and Chadwick King in April 2024. Lawyers for the clinic argue it has the right to renew its lease for a total of six more years. But if the judge rules in favour of the building's owners, the clinic will be forced to find a new home.This is not the landlords' first attempt to remove the clinic from their property. The brothers claimed that the clinic fraudulently concealed that they perform abortions, to which they maintain to be \"adamantly opposed\". The case was dismissed in September last year, with Judge Sage Johnson ruling:\"If [the landlords] had conducted a simple internet search on their tenants, as any reasonably prudent landlord likely would, they would have discovered that the clinic did, in fact, provide abortion services as is plainly stated on their website.\"Clinic owner Diana Derzis, who declined to comment on the hearing, previously stated that she hopes to keep the clinic in the city, even if they are evicted. However, she noted there are few other suitable facilities in Bristol, Virginia.The clinic leaving Bristol would be a \"blow\" to abortion access, according to Barbara Schwartz, the co-founder of SLAAP, the State Line Abortion Access Partnership.  Since Roe v Wade was overturned, states where abortions are legal have become destinations for out-of-state abortion seekers, with 155,000 people crossing state lines last year, according to the Guttmacher Institute (GI).The organisation also found that over 9,200 people travelled to Virginia alone to have the procedure done last year.\"Bristol's position means the clinic is the closest place by several hours to get a safe and legal abortion for millions of southerners.\"Victoria Cobb, the director of anti-abortion lobbyist the Family Foundation, also notes that Bristol's location places it at the \"epicentre of the debate\".Ms Cobb launched the first of several efforts to restrict abortion in Bristol by making use of local bylaws. The tactic is being used by anti-abortion campaigners in states which permit abortion. The logic is simple: If you can't win at Capitol Hill, why not fight at City Hall?\"Locals don't want to see their town turn into an abortion destination location,\" Ms Cobb states. \"We're happy to help them.\"Sammi Cooper is opposed to abortion and protests against the clinicThe Family Foundation has argued in the past that the existence of the clinic goes against zoning regulation, which prohibits buildings from being used in a way that could endanger life.\"Why would this not extend to unborn life?\" asked Ms Cobb.Their ordinance said no new clinics should be allowed to open in Bristol, and expansion of the existing clinic should be blocked.Similar rules have been used in other parts of the US to restrict abortion, including nearby Washington and Russell counties. But Prof Laura Hermer, an expert on abortion regulations in the US, says these efforts are largely \"virtue signalling\".\"I'd be surprised if many of these towns have any healthcare, let alone abortion, providers,\" she said.The debate became heated in Bristol, as the council agreed to look into the matter.\"It has been more stressful than dealing with a parking lot. It's not something that has really come to the local level before,\" Jay Detrick, the city's planning director told the BBC.Ultimately, the city's attorney found that imposing restrictions on a medical facility was not in their remit. Soon after the city decided not to intervene, another group decided to try and shut the clinic down - this one spearheaded by Texas pastor Mark Lee Dickson. The pastor has lobbied councils across the US to enforce the Comstock Act, a 152-year-old federal law that prohibits sending or receiving material via post which might induce an abortion.Ninety-three local authorities have passed ordinances to enforce the Comstock Act, even closing a Planned Parenthood clinic in Lubbock, Texas.Pastor Dickson is hopeful his ordinance filed in Bristol will have the same result. It has not yet been considered by the Council, but he remains optimistic.\"A local government's tabling or rejecting of such a measure doesn't by any means mean the initiative is dead,\" he told the BBC.Kimberly Smith, SLAAP's co-founder, anticipates further campaigns. She says anti-abortion activists target Bristol due to its unusual political make-up:\"They come here because we were a red part of a blue state. If they chip away here, then that weakens the entire framework of a state's rights.\"Indeed, even if the clinic wins its case this week and can remain in place, its opponents are undeterred, Pastor Dickson tells the BBC.\"As long as the cries of unborn babies are silenced in Bristol there will be an effort to push the City Council to fulfil their obligation to protect unborn Bristolians.\"",

    "body": "20 hours agoCaroline HawleyDiplomatic correspondentESOHREgyptian fisherman Issam al-Shazly was executed on Tuesday after being convicted of drug-related chargesSaudi Arabia has surpassed its record for the number of executions carried out annually for a second year in a row.At least 347 people have now been put to death this year, up from a total of 345 in 2024, according to the UK-based campaign group Reprieve, which tracks executions in Saudi Arabia and has clients on death row.It said this was the \"bloodiest year of executions in the kingdom since monitoring began\".The latest prisoners to be executed were two Pakistani nationals convicted of drug-related offences.Others put to death this year include a journalist and two young men who were children at the time of their alleged protest-related crimes. Five were women. But, according to Reprieve, most - around two thirds - were convicted of non-lethal drug-related offences, which the UN says is \"incompatible with international norms and standards\". More than half of them were foreign nationals who appear to have been put to death as part of a \"war on drugs\" in the kingdom.The Saudi authorities have not responded to the BBC's request for comment on the rise in executions.\"Saudi Arabia is operating with complete impunity now,\" said Jeed Basyouni, Reprieve's head of death penalty for the Middle East and North Africa. \"It's almost making a mockery of the human rights system.\"She described torture and forced confessions as \"endemic\" within the Saudi criminal justice system.Ms Basyouni called it a \"brutal and arbitrary crackdown\" in which innocent people and those on the margins of society have been caught up.On Tuesday, a young Egyptian fisherman, Issam al-Shazly, was executed. He was arrested in 2021 in Saudi territorial waters and said he had been coerced into smuggling drugs.Reprieve says 96 of the executions were solely linked to hashish.\"It almost seems that it doesn't matter to them who they execute, as long as they send a message to society that there's a zero-tolerance policy on whatever issue they're talking about - whether it's protests, freedom of expression, or drugs,\" said Ms Basyouni.There has been a surge of drug-related executions since the Saudi authorities ended an unofficial moratorium in late 2022 - a step described as \"deeply regrettable\" by the UN human rights office.Speaking anonymously to the BBC, relatives of men on death row on drugs charges have spoken of the \"terror\" they're now living in.One told the BBC: \"The only time of the week that I sleep is on Friday and Saturday because there are no executions on those days.\"Cellmates witness people they have shared prison life with for years being dragged kicking and screaming to their death, according to Reprieve.ReutersPrince Mohammed bin Salman has loosened social restrictions while simultaneously silencing criticismThe de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman - who became crown prince in 2017 - has changed the country profoundly over the past few years, loosening social restrictions while simultaneously silencing criticism.In a bid to diversify its economy away from oil, he has opened Saudi Arabia up to the outside world, taken the religious police off the streets, and allowed women to drive.But the kingdom's human rights record remains \"abysmal\", according to the US-based campaign group Human Rights Watch, with the high level of executions a major concern. In recent years, only China and Iran have put more people to death, according to human rights activists.\"There's been no cost for Mohammed bin Salman and his authorities for going ahead with these executions,\" said Joey Shea, who researches Saudi Arabia for Human Rights Watch. \"The entertainment events, the sporting events, all of it is continuing to happen with no repercussions, really.\"According to Reprieve, the families of those executed are usually not informed in advance, or given the body, or informed where they have been buried.The Saudi authorities do not reveal the method of execution, although it is believed to be either beheading or firing squad.In a statement sent to the BBC, the UN's special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Dr Morris Tidball-Binz, called for an immediate moratorium on executions in Saudi Arabia with a view to abolition,.He also pressed for \"full compliance with international safeguards (including effective legal assistance and consular access for foreign nationals), prompt notification of families, the return of remains without delay and the publication of comprehensive execution data to enable independent scrutiny\".Amnesty InternationalAbdullah al-Derazi and Jalal al-Labbad were executed in October and August respectively after being convicted of crimes they allegedly committed as minorsAmong the Saudi nationals executed this year were Abdullah al-Derazi and Jalal al-Labbad, who were both minors at the time of their arrest.They had protested against the government's treatment of the Shia Muslim minority in 2011 and 2012, and participated in the funerals of people killed by security forces. They were convicted of terrorism-related charges and sentenced to death after what Amnesty International said were grossly unfair trials that relied on torture-tainted \"confessions\". UN human rights experts had called for their release.The UN also condemned the execution in June of journalist Turki al-Jasser, who had been arrested in 2018 and sentenced to death on charges of terrorism and high treason based on writings he was accused of authoring.\"Capital punishment against journalists is a chilling attack on freedom of expression and press freedom,\" Unesco's Director-General, Audrey Azoulay, said.Reporters Without Borders said he was the first journalist to be executed in Saudi Arabia since Mohammed bin Salman came to power, although another journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, was murdered by Saudi agents at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018.Human Rights WatchJournalist Turki al-Jasser was executed in June after seven years in detentionLast December, UN experts wrote to the Saudi authorities to express concern over a group of 32 Egyptians and one Jordanian national sentenced to death on drugs charges, and their \"alleged absence of legal representation\". Since then, most of the group have been executed.A relative of one man put to death earlier this year said he had told her that people were being \"taken like goats\" to be killed.The BBC has approached the Saudi authorities for a response to the allegations but has not received one.But in a letter dated January 2025 - in reply to concerns raised by UN special rapporteurs - they said Saudi Arabia \"protects and upholds\" human rights and that its laws \"prohibit and punish torture\".\"The death penalty is imposed only for the most serious crimes and in extremely limited circumstances,\" the letter stated. \"It is not handed down or carried out until judicial proceedings in courts of all levels have been completed.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoTinshui YeungAnadolu via Getty ImagesMayor Yamanaka has been accused by officials of workplace harassmentThe mayor of Yokohama has apologised for insulting colleagues after an official publicly accused him of making offensive remarks.At a news conference, the Japanese city's human resource chief, Jun Kubota, alleged that Mayor Takeharu Yamanaka had used terms such as \"idiot\" and \"human scum\" to disparage staff.It is highly unusual in Japan for a serving city official to openly accuse a sitting mayor and demand an apology.Yamanaka initially denied the allegations, but later admitted to some of them. \"I want to frankly apologise for placing a psychological burden on the personnel director,\" he said.At a news conference on Thursday, Kubota accused Mayor Yamanaka of repeatedly making remarks towards officials - including himself - that could amount to workplace harassment.The mayor was accused of calling officials \"useless\", \"silly\" and \"low-spec\", as well as making comments about colleagues' appearance and likening them to animals.He is also accused of threatening Kubota, saying he would have to \"commit seppuku\" - a Japanese ritual suicide by disembowelment - if he failed to secure an international conference bid.Kubota demanded an apology from Yamanaka and called for an investigation.Yamanaka initially published a statement on his personal website, denying the allegations.But on Friday, he publicly acknowledged some remarks - such as using words like \"idiot\" and \"human scum\" - and apologised.\"I am reflecting on this. I will be more careful with my words and behaviour,\" Yamanaka said.He said those comments were made during discussions over personnel evaluations.However, the mayor denied other accusations, including insulting colleagues' appearance.Yamanaka said an investigation was being considered under the supervision of the deputy mayor, adding that he would co-operate \"sincerely\" if an investigation takes place.In response, Kubota insisted Yamanaka had made the comments he has not admitted to, saying: \"The mayor doesn't understand anything. I cannot accept that as an apology. I want him to change.\"More from the BBC",

    "body": "1 day agoMaia DaviesBBC NewsWatch: What Machado and Trump have said about Nobel Peace Prize medal exchangeVenezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has vowed she will lead the country \"when the right time comes\".\"There's a mission, and we are going to turn Venezuela into that land of grace, and I believe I will be elected when the right time comes as president of Venezuela, the first woman president,\" she told Fox News.Her comments come a day after she gave President Donald Trump her Nobel Peace Prize medal, calling it a recognition of his commitment to Venezuela's freedom.The US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in Caracas on 3 January and removed him to New York to face various drugs and weapons charges. EPA/ShutterstockMachado gave her Nobel Peace Prize medal to Donald Trump in Washington on Thursday However, Trump has declined to endorse Machado as Venezuela's new leader, saying she did not have enough domestic support - despite her opposition movement claiming victory in 2024's widely contested elections. He has instead been dealing with the country's interim president Delcy Rodríguez, who had been Maduro's vice-president and who on Friday held a two-hour meeting with the director of the CIA \"at President Trump's direction\" aimed at building trust and communication between the two countries, according to a US official.\"Director Ratcliffe discussed potential opportunities for economic collaboration and that Venezuela can no longer be a safe haven for America's adversaries,\" the US official said.Asked on Friday about his decision to work with Rodríguez over Machado, Trump told reporters his decision had been informed by the US experience in Iraq more than 20 years ago. Security and political structures were dismantled after the US invaded, setting the scene for insurgency and the eventual emergence of the Islamic State group.\"If you ever remember a place called Iraq, where everybody was fired - every single person, the police, the generals, everybody was fired - and they ended up being ISIS... I remember that,\" he said.Speaking later at an event in Washington, Machado said she was confident there would be an \"orderly transition\" in her country.\"The result of a stable transition will be a proud Venezuela that will be the best ally the US has ever had in the Americas,\" she said.\"This has nothing to do with a tension between Delcy Rodríguez and myself, this is about a criminal structure - that is the regime - and the Venezuelan people,\" she added, describing herself as \"just one member of a movement of millions of Venezuelans\".Meanwhile, in Venezuela's capital Caracas, Rodríguez gave her first state of the union address since taking over as interim president.She said she was not afraid to face the US \"diplomatically, through political dialogue\".Rodríguez also said Venezuela needed to defend its \"dignity and honour\", and announced oil industry reforms to allow more foreign investment in a step away from Maduro's policies.Trump called Rodríguez a \"terrific person\" on Wednesday after the pair spoke on the phone, a conversation the Venezuelan leader called \"productive and courteous\".The following day, the US president called Machado a \"wonderful woman who has been through so much\", describing her gift of the Nobel Peace Prize medal as a \"wonderful gesture of mutual respect\".Machado presented Trump with her Nobel Peace Prize medal on Thursday",

    "body": "1 day agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterSinger Julio Iglesias has denied allegations of sexual assault made by two female former employees.The women allege that the 82-year-old Spanish superstar \"normalised abuse\" in a coercive, threatening and violent environment while they were working at his properties in the Bahamas and Dominican Republic.Responding on Instagram, Iglesias said: \"I deny having abused, coerced, or disrespected any woman. These accusations are absolutely false and deeply sadden me.\"The allegations, which were first reported earlier this week, are being investigated by Spain's judiciary.The two women - a domestic worker and a physiotherapist - have alleged they suffered sexual and other forms of abuse while working at Iglesias's properties.The reports said they worked in his Caribbean residences for 10 months in 2021, which is when they allege the sexual assaults took place.On 5 January, the women filed a legal complaint for sexual assault and human trafficking with the national court, which investigates crimes allegedly committed beyond Spain's borders.Advocacy groups Women's Link Worldwide and Amnesty International said the acts alleged in the complaint could be considered \"a crime of human trafficking for the purpose of forced labour\" and \"crimes against sexual freedom\".According to testimony collected by the two groups, Iglesias subjected the women to \"sexual harassment, regularly checked their mobile phones, restricted their ability to leave the home where they worked, and required them to work up to 16 hours a day without days off\".Women's Link described the complainants as young Latin American women \"in vulnerable situations who were heavily dependent on their wages due to their economic and social conditions\".In his Instagram statement, Iglesias wrote: \"It is with profound sadness that I respond to the accusations made by two people who previously worked for me.He added: \"I have never felt such malice, but I still have the strength to let people know the whole truth and defend my dignity against such a serious accusation.\"The singer also thanked the \"so many dear people who have sent me messages of affection and loyalty\", adding: \"I have found great comfort in them.\"According to by Spanish news site elDiario.es and US outlet Univision, which investigated the claims over three years, the women's allegations are backed up by documentary evidence including photographs, phone records, text messages and medical reports.Their reports cite other former employees who describe a threatening, highly stressful atmosphere for those working for Iglesias.But an old friend of the singer, Jaime Peñafiel, labelled the accusations \"absolute lies\", while another ally, journalist Miguel Ángel Pastor, said he had never heard \"any suggestion that he might have committed this kind of act\".Iglesias is one of the most successful Latin artists of all time, having sold more than 300 million records in a career spanning decades.He is also the father of fellow music superstar Enrique Iglesias.",

    "body": "A man has gone on trial in Germany charged with driving his car into a crowd of people in the city of Munich last year, killing two people.The 25-year-old man, named only as Farhad N, in line with German privacy laws, is an Afghan national.Prosecutors say that on the morning of 13 February 2025, he deliberately drove his BMW Mini into a trade union demonstration in the centre of Munich. About 1,400 people were taking part in the street rally.A 37-year-old woman called Amel and her two-year-old daughter Hafsa died in hospital of their injuries shortly afterwards.They were the hit by the car first and thrown several metres by the force of the impact. Hafsa was still in her buggy.Among the 44 others who were hurt, a number suffered critical injuries.Those taking part in the union rally included city workers such as hospital and daycare staff calling for better wages. Amel herself had been working as an engineer and had come to Germany from Algeria at the age of four.Farhad N went on trial on Friday only a few hundred metres from the scene of the attack. Federal prosecutors say they believe he \"committed the crime out of excessive religious motivation. \"He believed he was obliged to attack and kill randomly selected people in Germany in response to the suffering of Muslims in Islamic countries,\" they say.According to investigators, the man shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" and prayed after committing the act.He is also accused of watching extremist preachers online, however officials do not believe he was part of any jihadist movement such as Islamic State.At the start of the trial the defendant hid his face behind a red folder and raised his right index finger – a common gesture among Muslims worldwide, symbolising belief in one God.His lawyer said his client would not comment on either the attack or his personal circumstances.Officials say he arrived in Germany in 2016 as a teenager. Germany took in more than a million asylum seekers in 2015-2016 at the height of Europe's migrant crisis - an influx that has proved deeply divisive and fuelled the rise of the far-right AfD.Farhad N came alone, without his family and, although his asylum request was rejected, he was not deported and had been given temporary residency in Munich.German authorities said he was legally resident in Germany, had a work permit and had jobs working as a shop security guard and for security companies.Farhad N had no previous convictions. He was active on Instagram, where he posted about bodybuilding and religious themes.He was arrested on the day of the Munich attack. The trial is expected to continue until June.",

    "body": "1 day agoLucy WilliamsonBashmaq border crossing, Iraqi KurdistanFred Scott/BBCPeople and traffic still regularly cross the Iran-Iraq borderAt the border crossing from Iran into Iraqi Kurdistan, the stern face of Iran's former supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, peers down at the trickle of Iranians leaving the territory.Thick snowflakes confetti the lorries and pedestrians arriving at this remote mountain pass.Metres away, just beyond the border post, an Iranian flag flutters in the snow.Iran has shut down the internet and blocked phone calls into the country, but its borders are still open.Inside the arrivals hall, we find dozens of men, women and children – many arriving to visit family on the Iraqi side of the border. No-one we met said they were fleeing Iran because of the recent protests and government crackdown, but one man – who asked us to hide his identity – told us security forces had shot him during a protest in central Iran last Friday.\"I was hit in the face by seven pellet rounds,\" he said, pointing out several weals and bruises on his face. \"They struck above my eyelid, on my forehead, my cheek, my lip, under my ear and along my jaw. I had to use a razor blade to cut one of the pellets out.\"He told us he was too afraid of being arrested to get medical help, and that others injured during the government crackdown on protestors were also avoiding treatment, out of fear that security forces would arrive and arrest them.\"One of my friends told me he was hit by a pellet round,\" he told us.  \"His son, who is around 12 or 13 years old, was struck twice in the leg by live ammunition. One of the bullets is lodged in the shin bone.  They're terrified of going to hospital to have it removed.\"Iran's regime has treated these protests as an existential threat.  Its crackdown seems to be working, and protesters are now thought to be largely staying at home, for fear of being shot or arrested. Rights groups say at least around 2,500 people have been killed.But several people here told us that demonstrations had continued, at least into this week. The protester we spoke to said security forces had crushed protests in his own town last Friday, but that they had continued elsewhere.\"Demonstrations were still going on in Fardis and Malard, and some areas of Tehran,\" he said.  \"My friends were there.  We were constantly on the phone.  On Tuesday night, the protests were still going on, but I haven't had any updates since then.\"Iranians don't need a visa to cross here, and officials say there is regular traffic back and forth.Another man we spoke to at the border said he had been in Tehran on Wednesday, and seen protesters on the street.  It's not clear what form of protest that was, or how many were taking part.The BBC has seen no hard evidence that street protests are still continuing. Very little footage at all is trickling out, and the reports we heard today are impossible to confirm. The BBC, along with other international media, is barred from reporting inside Iran.Fred Scott/BBCThe Iranian authorities imposed an internet blackout more than a week agoThe government's repression largely seems to be working. But the economic problems that sparked this crisis haven't gone away.A teacher from a town close to the border told us she didn't care who the leader was, she just wanted the economic situation to improve.\"We don't want anything more than our basic rights,\" she told me. \"To own a house, to own a car, to have a normal life. My salary lasts 10 days, and I have to borrow money to cover the rest of the month. It's very bad.\"I ask about US President Donald Trump, and his threat of military strikes if the regime kept killing protesters.\"We're waiting to see what Trump does,\" he told me. \"In the meantime, civilians are getting killed.\"The force with which Iran's leaders have crushed this protest signals their weakness.  The regional proxy groups they once used as defences against attack have been weakened by Israel's war with Hamas and Hezbollah, and by the fall of the former Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad.And the Israeli-US war with Iran last year has depleted its military capabilities, and left it vulnerable to attack.Hidden behind this mountainous border, Iran's regime is re-imposing its control.But hidden behind that repressive control is the growing fear of the Islamic Republic, unable to meet its people's most basic demands: protection from foreign attacks, and prosperity at home.Additional reporting by Samantha Granville and Maad Mohammed",

    "body": "A US federal judge has issued an order limiting the crowd control tactics that can be used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents (ICE) towards \"peaceful and unobstructive\" protesters in Minneapolis.Judge Katherine Menendez ruled on Friday night that federal agents can't arrest or pepper spray peaceful demonstrators, including those monitoring and observing ICE agents. The ruling comes ahead of planned weekend protests against the widespread immigration action in the city and follows the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent earlier this month.The US Department of Homeland Security said it is taking measures to protect officers from rioters.On Friday, Minnesota officials urged protesters expected to take to the streets this weekend to stay orderly and peaceful.The state's National Guard has been placed on alert and other law enforcement officers have been deployed ahead of both expected anti-ICE demonstrations and a counter march being planned by a conservative influencer. Judge Menendez's 83-page order bars federal agents from arresting and \"using pepper-spray or similar nonlethal munitions and crowd dispersal tools against persons who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest activity\".The ruling, which stems from a lawsuit filed by a group of protesters in December, also limits agents from \"stopping or detaining drivers and passengers in vehicles where there is no reasonable articulable suspicion that they are forcibly obstructing or interfering\" with their work. \"The act of safely following [immigration agents] at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop,\" it says. In a statement to CBS, the BBC's US partner, in response to the order, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said the agency \"is taking appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters\".The White House also criticised the ruling.\"This absurd ruling embraces a dishonest, left-wing narrative,\" spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Politico. \"Here's the truth: federal agents have acted lawfully to protect themselves and ensure the integrity of their operations when individuals attempt to intervene.\"Minneapolis has been on edge since Good's 7 January shooting, with protests across the city. There have been some reported clashes between protesters and federal officers over the past week.Additionally on Friday, the justice department  announced it was investigating two of the state's leading Democrats - Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey - over alleged attempts to impede federal immigration operations.Both have condemned the ICE operations in the city.\"A reminder to all those in Minnesota:  No one is above the law,\" US Attorney General Pam Bondi said in an online statement.The investigation was criticised by Walz and Frey. \"Weaponizing the justice system against your opponents is an authoritarian tactic,\" Walz said in a statement.",

    "body": "2 days agoJake Kwon,Seoul correspondentandLeehyun Choi,SeoulEPA/ShutterstockYoon was impeached in 2024 for his martial law attemptSouth Korea's impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol will be jailed for five years over abuse of power, obstructing justice and falsifying documents in relation to his failed martial law bid in 2024.This is the first of the verdicts in four trials linked to his shock martial law decree. Although short-lived, the move triggered nationwide turmoil, sparking protests as MPs rushed to the national assembly to overturn Yoon's decision.  Yoon's actions \"plunged the country into political crisis\", a judge said on Friday, noting that Yoon had \"consistently shown no remorse\".Friday's ruling offers clues as to how the rest of Yoon's trials could go. His string of charges range from abuse of power to campaign law violations. The most serious charge is insurrection, for which prosecutors have demanded the death penalty. The verdict in that trial is expected in February.About 100 supporters of Yoon had gathered outside the courthouse on Friday to watch the livestreamed proceedings projected on a large screen.Some of them held red banners that read: \"Yoon, again! Make Korea great again\". Several could be heard yelling at the judge as he delivered the guilty verdicts, while others looked solemn.On Friday, Yoon was convicted of using presidential bodyguards to prevent his arrest; failing to consult his entire cabinet before declaring martial law; as well as drafting and then destroying a falsified document claiming the martial law bid had been endorsed by the prime minister and defence minister.\"The accused has the duty to safeguard the constitution and law but turned his back on them,\" the judge said. Prosecutors had sought a 10-year jail term for the charges in Friday's ruling. Both sides have seven days to appeal.About 100 supporters of Yoon had gathered outside the courthouse on FridayYoon denied the charges, arguing that the arrest warrant itself was invalid and that the letter of the law does not require him to consult every member of the cabinet before exercising emergency power.He had claimed across his trials that investigators had no legal basis to probe and arrest him in the first place. Most of the accusations against him are invalid because there was no procedural lapse when he declared martial law, he argues.South Korea's courts often grant leniency when the accused accepts guilt or responsibility. But prosecutors argue that Yoon's lack of remorse is grounds for an even more severe penalty.Park Geun-hye, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for abuse of power and bribery in 2021, was the last former president to be jailed for a criminal charge. But she was pardoned and released from prison shortly after.Six months after Yoon's martial law attempt, voters elected opposition leader Lee Jae Myung in a decisive victory . But Yoon's trials bring the spotlight back to deep divisions in South Korea, where the former president  retains strong supporters who see him as a martyr. According to a survey conducted last December, nearly 30% of South Koreans did not believe that Yoon's martial law declaration amounted to an insurrection.While his martial law attempt brought tens of thousands of protesters onto the streets, it also saw his supporters show up in counter protests, though in smaller numbers.

    "body": "6 hours agoJack BurgessandGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianIranian leader press office via Getty ImagesIran's supreme leader has for the first time publicly acknowledged that thousands of people were killed, \"some in an inhuman, savage manner\", during recent protests.A violent response to the unrest has claimed 3,090 lives, according to US-based Iranian Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), with some activist groups putting the death toll far higher. An internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to get clear information.In a speech on Saturday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said thousands had been killed and blamed the US for the deaths.US President Donald Trump recently urged Iranian demonstrators to \"keep protesting\" and threatened military intervention if security forces kill them.The protests, which began on 28 December over the economy, have turned into calls for the end of the rule of Iran's supreme leader.The Iranian government has called the demonstrations \"riots\" backed by Iran's enemies.Protesters have been met with deadly force and videos of security forces shooting at demonstrations have been authenticated by both BBC Persian and BBC Verify.There has also been a near-total shutdown of the internet and communication services in Iran. On Saturday overall connectivity remained at about 2% of ordinary levels, according to cyber monitor NetBlocks.There have been fewer reports of unrest in recent days but with internet access still restricted developments on the ground remain unclear. A woman in Shiraz, south-western Iran, told BBC Persian that \"security forces are still patrolling on motorbikes to keep the situation under control, but overall things have gone back to normal\". During his speech on Saturday, Khamenei also said Iran considered President Trump to be a \"criminal\" and said the US must be \"held accountable\" for recent unrest.He also claimed on social media that \"America's goal is to swallow Iran\". Trump has not yet responded to the supreme leader and the BBC has approached the White House for a comment.The US state department said on Saturday that it had \"heard reports that the Islamic Republic is preparing options to target American bases\".It said Iran would be met with \"a very, very powerful force\" if it launched such an attack and warned Tehran not to \"play games with President Trump\".The US president said on Wednesday he had been told \"the killing in Iran has stopped\", but added that he had not ruled out military action against the country.His comments came after the US and UK both reduced the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar.Officials told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that a partial American withdrawal was a \"precautionary measure\".",

    "body": "The Syrian army is moving into areas east of Aleppo city, after Kurdish forces started a withdrawal.Syrian troops have been spotted entering Deir Hafer, a town about 50km (30 miles) from Aleppo.On Friday, the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia announced it would redeploy east of the Euphrates river. This follows talks with US officials, and a pledge from Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa to make Kurdish a national language.After deadly clashes last week, the US urged both sides to avoid a confrontation. President al-Sharaa is seeking to integrate the Kurds' military and civilian bodies into Syrian national institutions.In a statement to state-run news agency Sana, the Syrian army said its forces \"began entering the western Euphrates area\", and declared it had established \"full military control\" of Deir Hafer.The military urged civilians not to enter the operations area until it is secured and \"cleared it of all mines and war remnants\".Images showed Syrian forces advancing towards the area, including with tanks.The move comes after Kurdish leader Mazloum Abdi agreed to pull back his US-backed SDF \"towards redeployment in areas east of the Euphrates\", responding to \"calls from friendly countries and mediators\".US special envoy Tom Barrack and Mazloum Abdi are set to meet later on Saturday in Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan.In recent days, the Syrian army had urged civilians to flee the Deir Hafer area, with at least 4,000 people leaving, according to Syrian authorities.Before the Kurdish withdrawal, President al-Sharaa said he would make Kurdish a national language, and recognise the Kurdish new year as an official holiday.The decree, announced on Friday, is the first formal recognition of Kurdish national rights since Syria's independence in 1946. It stated that Kurds were \"an essential and integral part\" of Syria, where they have endured decades of oppression under previous rulers.Despite the apparent easing of tensions, disagreements linger. In response to the decree, the Kurdish administration in Syria's north and north-east said it was \"a first step\" but called for \"permanent constitutions that express the will of the people\", rather than \"temporary decrees\".Both sides have accused each other of violating the terms of the agreement. Syria's army said two of its soldiers had been killed by Kurdish forces as the military moved in, while the SDF accused Damascus of sending troops in early. Kurdish forces have been controlling swathes of Syria's oil-rich north and north-east, much of it gained during the civil war and the fight against the Islamic State group over the past decade.Following the ousting of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in late 2024, President al-Sharaa has been seeking to integrate the Kurdish bodies into Syrian institutions.In March 2025, the SDF signed a deal with the government to that effect. Almost a year on, the agreement is still not implemented, with each sides blaming the other.",

    "body": "18 hours agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology correspondent, San FranciscoGoogle has appealed a US district judge's landmark antitrust ruling that found the company illegally held a monopoly in online search.\"As we have long said, the Court's August 2024 ruling ignored the reality that people use Google because they want to, not because they're forced to,\" Google's vice president for regulatory affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland said.In its announcement on Friday, Google said the ruling by Judge Amit Mehta didn't account for the pace of innovation and intense competition the company faces.The company is requesting a pause on implementing a series of fixes - viewed by some observers as too lenient - aimed at limiting its monopoly power.Judge Mehta acknowledged the rapid changes to the Google's business when he issued his remedies in September, writing that the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) had changed the course of the case.He refused to grant government lawyers their request for a Google breakup that would include a spin-off of Chrome, the world's most popular browser.Instead, he pushed less rigorous remedies, including a requirement that Google share certain data with \"qualified competitors\" as deemed by the court.That data was due to include portions of its search index, Google's massive inventory of web content that functions like a map of the internet.The judge also called for Google to allow certain competitors to display the tech giant's search results as their own in a bid to give upstarts the time and resources they need to innovate.On Friday, Mulholland balked at being forced to share search data and syndication services with rivals as she justified the request for a halt to implementing the orders.\"These mandates would risk Americans' privacy and discourage competitors from building their own products — ultimately stifling the innovation that keeps the U.S. at the forefront of global technology,\" Mulholland wrote.While the company has invested growing sums of cash into AI, those ambitions have come under scrutiny.Last month, the EU opened an investigation into Google over its AI summaries which appear above search results.The European Commission said it would probe whether Google used data from websites to provide the service and failed to offer appropriate compensation to publishers.Google said the investigation risked stifling innovation in a competitive market.This week, Google parent Alphabet became the fourth company ever to reach a market capitalisation of $4tn.",

    "description": "Myanmar has denied committing genocide against the Ronhingya people, saying The Gambia has failed to provide enough proof, as it begun its defence at ",
    "body": "Myanmar has denied committing genocide against the Ronhingya people, saying The Gambia has failed to provide enough proof, as it begun its defence at the UN's top court.Ko Ko Hlaing, a Myanmar government representative, told judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that the allegation was \"unsubstantiated\".Earlier this week, The Gambia's foreign minister Dawda Jallow told the court Myanmar wanted to erase the minority Muslim population through its use of \"genocidal policies\".Thousands of Rohingya were killed and more than 700,000 fled to neighbouring Bangladesh during an army crackdown in Myanmar in 2017.A damning report issued by the UN the following year said top military figures in Myanmar must be investigated for genocide in Rakhine state and crimes against humanity in other areas.Myanmar - which has been under military control since it overthrew the civilian government in 2021 - rejected the report and has consistently said its operations targeted militant or insurgent threats.On Friday, Hlaning told the ICJ that \"Myanmar was not obliged to remain idle and allow terrorists to have free reign of northern Rakhine states\", where the majority of Rohingya lived.\"These attacks were the reasons for the clearance operations, which is a military term referring to counter-insurgency or counter-terrorism operations,\" Hlaing said.The Gambia launched its case against Myanmar in 2019, with Jallow telling the ICJ it did so out of a \"sense of responsibility\" following its own experience with a military government.Jallow told the court on Monday that the Rohingya \"had suffered decades of appalling persecution and years of dehumanising propaganda\", which was followed by the military crackdown and \"continual genocidal policies meant to erase their existence in Myanmar\".Lawyers for the Muslim-majority West African country also argued that the killing of women, children and the elderly, along with the destruction of their villages, was hard to justify under combatting terrorism. \"When the court considers... all of the evidence taken together, the only reasonable conclusion to reach is that a genocidal intent permeated and informed Myanmar's myriad of state-led actions against the Rohingya,\" said Philippe Sands, arguing for The Gambia, which has the backing of 57-nation Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in its action.More than a million Rohingya refugees now live across the border in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar region alone - some of the largest and most densely populated camps in the world, according to the UN's refugee agency.Hlaing - the Myanmar government representative - said on Friday that it was committed to \"achieving the repatriation to Myanmar of persons from Rakhine State currently living in camps in Bangladesh\". But he also said external forces, such as Covid-19, had hampered those efforts.\"Myanmar's commitment and constant efforts since 2017 contradict Gambia's narrative that Myanmar's intention is to destroy or forcibly deport this population,\" Hlaing told the court.He added that \"a finding of genocide would place an indelible stain on my country and its people\", so the outcome was of \"fundamental importance for my country's reputation and future\".The court has also set aside three days to hear from witnesses, including Rohingya survivors, but these sessions will be closed to the public and media.A final ruling is expected towards the end of 2026, Reuters news agency reported.It is expected to set a precedent in other genocide cases, including one brought by South Africa against Israel over the war in Gaza, as it is the first to be heard in more than a decade - and is being seen as an opportunity for ICJ judges to refine rules around the definition of genocide.The 1948 UN Genocide Convention, which The Gambia accuses Myanmar of breaching in its treatment of the Rohingya, was adopted following the mass murder of Jews by Nazi Germany during the Second World War. It defines genocide as crimes committed \"with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group\".",

    "body": "Ugandan leader extends 40-year rule after winning contested poll3 hours agoAnita Nkonge,BBC Africa,Damian ZaneandLucy FlemingAFP via Getty ImagesYoweri Museveni first came to power in 1986 as a rebel leaderUgandan President Yoweri Museveni has been declared the winner of Thursday's election extending his four decades in power by another five years.He gained 72% of the vote, the election commission announced, against 25% for his closest challenger Bobi Wine, who has condemned what he described as \"fake results\" and \"ballot stuffing\".Wine has not provided any details and the authorities have not responded to his allegations, but African Union election observers said they saw \"no evidence of ballot stuffing\". Wine has called for non-violent protests.Museveni, 81, first came to power as a rebel leader in 1986 but since then has won seven elections. The election process was marred by violence and Wine, a 43-year-old former pop star, says that at least 21 people have been killed around the country in recent days.The authorities have so far confirmed seven deaths.Announcing the results, electoral commission head Simon Byabakama asked supporters of both factions to embrace unity and accept the results.Beyond the national tallying centre, there have been minimal celebrations, with most roads in the capital, Kampala, empty and businesses closed.However, pockets of violence have been reported in several neighbourhoods.Access to the internet has been cut in the country since Tuesday, making it hard to verify information.The authorities say the blackout was necessary to prevent misinformation, fraud and the incitement of violence - a move condemned by the UN human rights office as \"deeply worrying\".Wine has demanded that the internet be restored.ReutersSpeaker of Parliament Anita Among celebrated Yoweri Museveni's victory at the electoral commissionLeading the African Union observer mission, Nigeria's former President Goodluck Jonathan told journalists that \"the government should refrain from the suspension of internet access\" close to the election.He also denounced \"reports of intimidation, arrest and abductions\" saying they \"instilled fear and eroded public trust in the electoral process\", AFP news agency reports.Speaking to the BBC, Wine's assistant Dan Magic alleged that security personnel entered the opposition leader's home on Thursday night in order to take him. It is not clear what happened next, but Magic said that Wine's whereabouts were unknown.Wine had previously said he was under house arrest. On Saturday, he posted a statement on Facebook saying he had evaded an attempt to seize him.This has not been confirmed by the police but spokesman Kituuma Rusoke said  the politician's movements had been restricted because his home was an area of \"security interest\".\"We have controlled access to areas which are security hotspots,\" Uganda's Daily Monitor paper quoted him as saying.\"We cannot allow people to use some places to gather and cause chaos,\" he said.Wine says he represents the youth in a country where most of the population is aged under 30. During the campaign, he promised to tackle corruption and impose sweeping reforms, while Museveni argued that he was the sole guarantor of stability in Uganda, a country with a history of conflict.There were six other candidates but none got more than 2% of the vote. Turnout was 52.5%.The campaign period was marred by the disruption of opposition activities - security forces have been accused of assaulting and detaining Wine's supporters.Rusoke, the police spokesperson, dismissed these complaints, accusing opposition supporters of being disruptive.Additional reporting by Joseph Winter and Sammy Awami in KampalaMore about Uganda from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "1 day agoEd Habershon,JohannesburgandNatasha BootyThe US has accused South Africa's defence ministry of refusing to obey orders from its own government to send home Iranian warships that have been conducting naval exercises in the African country's waters. \"South Africa can't lecture the world on 'justice' while cozying up to Iran,\" it said in a statement.In response, South Africa's defence ministry said it was launching an inquiry to get to the root of these \"serious allegations\".Washington has criticised South Africa for inviting Iran at a time when a brutal crackdown against protests was happening in the Middle Eastern country. It said the South African military's actions did not amount to \"non-alignment\" but were instead a \"choice to stand with Iran\". \"This is absolutely no surprise. Protests against the Iranian regime are happening right now, human rights organisations here in SA have been calling for support for the protesters,\" William Gumede, an associate professor at the University of Witwatersrand, told the BBC. \"These are all democratic violations and human rights abuses and we have not heard a whimper from the ANC. That is the irony and hypocrisy, it's been criticising other regimes but it's been silent on what's happening in Iran.\"In the strongly worded statement posted on its social media accounts, the US embassy in South Africa said it noted with \"concern and alarm\" reports that the country's defence minister and its defence forces had defied government orders to ask Iran to leave. The US embassy said Iran's participation \"undermined maritime security and regional stability\" and was \"unconscionable\" as it suppressed protests back home, comparing them to \"peaceful political activity South Africans fought so hard to gain for themselves\". On Friday the office of Defence Minister Angie Motshekga said she \"would like to place it on record\" that President Cyril Ramaphosa's instructions had been \"clearly communicated to all parties concerned, agreed upon and to be implemented and adhered to as such\".Dubbed \"Peace Resolve\", the week-long naval drill got under way last Friday. It is being led by China - and involves other members from an alliance of major developing countries, including Russia, which when it was launched in 2006 was known as Bric.It took its acronym from its founding members Brazil, Russia, India and China - and when South Africa joined four years later an \"s\" was added to its name.With the recent addition of Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) the alliance is now called Brics+ - and its aim is to challenge the political and economic power of the wealthier Western nations.Iranian warships had already arrived in Cape Town when the order to turn them around reportedly came through.

    "body": "From camouflage to tracksuits - Guinea's junta leader becomes civilian president6 hours agoDamian ZaneGuinea PresidencyOfficial pictures of Mamadi Doumbouya have portrayed him in a more relaxed modeFrom the moment he seized power in September 2021 Guinea's Mamadi Doumbouya struck an imposing figure.Just 36 years old at the time, the broad-shouldered colonel, standing at well over six feet (1.8m), wearing military fatigues, mirrored sunglasses and a red beret certainly made an impression when announcing the coup.A relatively unknown member of an elite army unit, he declared that the government of ousted President Alpha Condé had disregarded democratic principles and that citizens' rights were being trampled on.After more than four years of acting as interim president, and going back on a promise not to run for leadership of the country, Doumbouya, now 41, was sworn in as the elected head of state on Saturday.The discreet, disciplined and private man won 87% of the vote in December's election against a severely depleted field.Ex-Prime Minister Cellou Dalein Diallo, now in exile, described the process as a charade which generated \"fabricated\" results.While seemingly enjoying some popular support, critics have questioned Doumbouya's democratic credentials as some political parties have been banned, activists have mysteriously disappeared and media outlets been shut down.ReutersVideo footage shot in the aftermath of the 2021 coup showed Doumbouya being greeted by enthusiastic crowdsScrolling back through the social media accounts from the president's office there is a sense of a carefully curated image.The army man, now a general, has, for the main, ditched the camouflage in favour of the baseball cap and tracksuit, or a boubou - traditional Guinean attire of loose-fitting robes with elaborate embroidery. The shades though are still at times in evidence.Pictures show him at the opening of schools, or transport and mining infrastructure or cycling through the streets of the capital, Conakry. The message is clear: this is a man of action who is working on behalf of the people.\"This was presenting an image of someone who can be close to civilians, someone who is a civilian leader and can be representative of the people,\" Beverly Ochieng, senior analyst with Dakar-based security intelligence firm Control Risks, told the BBC.\"In some ways this is distancing himself from what brought him to power – a coup - and the fact that his entire career has been in the military.\"In the 15 years before he took power, Doumbouya gained extensive international experience, including being educated to master's level in France and serving in the French Foreign Legion. He was also in Afghanistan, Ivory Coast, Djibouti, Central African Republic and worked on close protection in Israel, Cyprus and the UK.But the donning of civilian clothes may not be entirely sincere, according to some analysts.\"I'm not sure that he has transitioned from a military man. I think that the military costume will remain even if he is conducting the return to civilian order,\" argued Aïssatou Kanté, a researcher in the West Africa office of the Institute of Security Studies.She referred to a ban on political demonstrations, the exclusion of Doumbouya's main challengers in December's election and the suspension of key opposition parties.Human rights campaigners have demanded to know the whereabouts of two activists - Oumar Sylla (known as Foniké Menguè) and Mamadou Billo Bah – who have not been seen since July 2024. They suspect the men were taken by the military.Press freedom organisation Reporters Without Borders has also expressed concern that journalist Habib Marouane Camara has been missing for more than a year. It has described how journalists are now censoring themselves and are fearful about what might happen to them.Nevertheless, the 2021 coup was widely welcomed in the country and since then Doumbouya appears to have remained a popular figure.Polling organisation Afrobarometer found that between 2022 and 2024 the proportion of people who trusted the president either \"partially\" or \"a lot\" grew from 46% to 53%.Guinea PresidencyDoumbouya (R) welcomed Rwandan President Paul Kagame to the country in November for the start of operations at the Simandou iron-ore mineThe president-elect may not have a clearly defined ideology guiding him but for Kanté his emphasis on Guineans being in control of their own destiny has become very important.\"It's what keeps coming up in official speeches - this affirmation of political and economic sovereignty,\" she told the BBC.In his address to the nation a few days into the new year, he struck a conciliatory tone, calling on all Guineans to build a nation of peace and \"fully assumed\" sovereignty.In a country that continues to grapple with high levels of poverty despite plentiful natural resources – including the world's largest reserves of bauxite, which is used to make aluminium - this idea strikes a chord.The government's messaging on the development of the vast iron-ore resources in Simandou underscores the possible benefits for the people.The three billion tonnes of ore available in a remote southern part of the country, which began to be exported last month, could transform the global iron market, as well as Guinea's fortunes.The authorities say earnings from the project, partly owned by Chinese miners as well as the British-Australian corporation Rio Tinto, will be invested in new transport infrastructure as well as health and education.The success or otherwise of Simandou may define Doumbouya's presidency.AFP via Getty ImagesIn 2021, Doumbouya wore formal military dress when he was sworn in as interim leaderHe appears determined to keep some of the processing and added-value parts of the industry in Guinea to ensure greater benefits.Across the broader mining sector, his government has cancelled dozens of contracts over the past year where it was felt that the companies were not investing in Guinea – a move that has led one UAE-based firm to take the country to an international court.\"This move towards resource nationalism makes him look like a local hero. He looks like he's really fighting for the rights of his citizens, even if that means business disruptions,\" said analyst Ochieng.The emphasis on sovereignty has also led to a pragmatic approach to international relations, observers say. Unlike coup leaders elsewhere in West Africa, Doumbouya has not outrightly rejected the former colonial power France in favour of Russia.Neither, despite his background in France and having a French wife, has he been accused of being a puppet of Paris.Doumbouya very much wants to be seen as someone running things in the interests of the country.The president has preached a message of national unity and will hope that he can usher in a new era of prosperity for Guinea.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "1 day agoLaura Bicker,Beijing ,Suranjana Tewari,Singapore ,Koh Ewe,SingaporeandJessica Murphy,TorontoReutersMark Carney's visit to China is the first by a Canadian leader in nearly a decadeChinese leader Xi Jinping and Canadian PM Mark Carney have announced lower tariffs, signalling a reset in their countries' relationship after a key meeting in Beijing.China is expected to lower levies on Canadian canola oil from 85% to 15% by 1 March, while Ottawa has agreed to tax Chinese electric vehicles at the most-favoured-nation rate, 6.1%, Carney told reporters. The deal is a breakthrough after years of strained ties and tit-for-tat levies. Xi hailed the \"turnaround\" in their relationship but it is also a win for Carney, the first Canadian leader to visit China in nearly a decade.  He has been trying to diversify Canadian trade away from the US, his country's  biggest trading partner, following the uncertainty caused by Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs. The deal could also see more Chinese investments in Canada, right on America's doorstep. Carney himself seemed to allude to the fact that this was a result of Trump's tariffs, which have now pushed one of the US's key allies towards its biggest rival. He told reporters that Canada's relationship with China had been more \"predictable\" in recent months and that he found talks with Beijing \"realistic and respectful\".He also made clear Ottawa does not agree with Beijing on everything, adding that in his discussions with Xi he made clear Canada's \"red lines\", including human rights, concerns over election interference and the need for \"guardrails\".\"We take the world as it is - not as we wish it to be,\" he said when asked about China's human rights record.Observers believe Carney's visit could set an example for other countries across the world who are also feeling the pain from Washington's tariffs. In contrast, Xi has been trying to show that China is a stable global partner and has been urging more pragmatic ties - in the words of Beijing, \"a win-win\" for all.And it seems to be working. The South Korean president and the Irish prime minister have both visited Beijing in recent weeks. The UK prime minister is expected to visit soon and so is the German Chancellor.Carney said the \"world has changed dramatically\" and how Canada positions itself \"will shape our future for decades to come,\" he added. Earlier in his three-day visit, he had said that the Canada-China partnership sets the two countries up for a \"new world order\". He later added that the multilateral system had been \"eroded, to use a polite term, or undercut\". As the Chinese and Canadian delegations sat down in the Great Hall of the People on Friday, Xi said: \"The healthy and stable development of China-Canada relations is conducive to world peace, stability, development, and prosperity.\" Getty ImagesCarney in the Great Hall of the People during the meeting with Xi  A trade reset Tariffs have been a key sticking point between the two sides. In 2024, Canada imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, following similar US curbs.Last year, Beijing retaliated with tariffs on more than $2bn (£1.5bn) of Canadian farm and food products like canola seed and oil. As a result Chinese imports of Canadian goods fell by 10% in 2025.In the deal struck on Friday, Canada will allow only 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the Canadian market at the 6.1% tariff rate.The cap is in response to Canadian automakers' fears of an influx of affordable Chinese EVs.As well as relief for canola producers, there will also be reduced tariffs on Canadian lobsters, crabs, and peas.China is Canada's second-largest trading partner but it's still a long way behind the US in volume.Economic ties with China are increasingly important for Carney. On arrival in Beijing on Wednesday, he met senior executives from prominent Chinese businesses, including an electric vehicle battery maker and an energy giant.On Thursday the two countries signed several agreements on energy and trade cooperation.The visit is a \"reset of a relationship\" that may be \"modest in ambition\" but \"much more realistic about what we can reasonably obtain\", said Colin Robertson, a former Canadian diplomat and vice-president at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute.A frosty history The last Canadian PM to visit China was Justin Trudeau, who met Xi in Beijing in 2017.That visit took place before the relationship soured in 2018, following Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer  at the Chinese tech giant Huawai, at the request of the US.Days later, China detained Canadian citizens Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor on espionage charges - a move critics saw as retaliation for Meng's arrest, which China denied.Meng and both Michaels were released in 2021.Ahead of the Carney-Xi meeting, Michael Kovrig wrote on X that the visit should not just be about warming ties but also \"managing leverage\".Kovrig described Chinese negotiators as \"extremely adroit, calculating, and always looking for leverage\".\"That's why engagement has to be handled with discipline,\" he wrote, adding that Carney should also advocate for Canadians imprisoned in China. There are about 100 of them, according to Canadian media.Speaking to reporters, Carney was clear that with countries that do not share the same values, Ottawa will engage on a \"narrower, more specific\" manner.\"We're very clear about where we cooperate, where we differ,\" he said, adding that Chinese claims over self-governed Taiwan and Hong Kong's jailed pro-democracy figure Jimmy Lai came up in \"broad discussions\". Canada and China have \"different systems\", he said, which limits the breadth of their cooperation. \"But to have an effective relationship, we have direct conversations. We don't grab a megaphone and have the conversations that way.\"",

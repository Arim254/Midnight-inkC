    "body": "5 hours agoDavid GrittenReutersAlaa Abdel Fattah celebrated with his mother, Leila Souief (left), and his sister, Sanaa Seif (right), following his release from prison in SeptemberBritish-Egyptian pro-democracy activist Alaa Abdel Fattah was stopped from flying to the UK by Egyptian passport control earlier this week, his family says.Mr Abdel Fattah, 43, was Egypt's best known political prisoner until seven weeks ago, when he was released from jail after being granted a pardon by President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi.He attempted to fly to London on Tuesday with his sister Sanaa, but was told by officials at Cairo International Airport that he was not allowed to travel. \"They blocked him from boarding the flight and I had to go alone,\" Sanaa told the BBC's Today programme on Friday. There was no immediate comment from the Egyptian government.\"They didn't explain much. Our lawyers in Egypt are trying to understand the legal grounds,\" Sanaa said. She added that her brother had his British passport as well as a recently renewed Egyptian passport.\"I assumed after the renewal of the Egyptian passport that he would be allowed.\"Alaa Abdel Fattah's 13-year-old son, Khaled, lives with his mother in Brighton, where he attends a special needs school because he is on the autism spectrum.Khaled spent a month visiting his father in Cairo following his release from prison, but he has now returned to the UK.\"We're really glad to have [Alaa] back in our lives partially free, but he needs to have freedom of movement to live with his son, reunited with him properly,\" Ms Seif said.She added: \"Khaled needs his father. My nephew… is very, very comfortable in his school and his set-up in Brighton. We can't change. We can't keep creating instability.\"Ms Seif said the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office had been communicating with her family over the issue, but she called on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's office to also give it their attention.The FCDO said in a statement: \"President Sisi's decision to pardon and release Alaa Abdel Fattah was extremely welcome news and a significant step forward.\"\"We continue to press for his urgent return to the UK at the highest levels with the Egyptian government so he can be reunited with his family. The case remains a priority issue for the UK government.\"On Thursday night, Alaa Abdel Fattah and his mother were given the 2025 Magnitsky Award for \"Courage Under Fire\". Sanaa had to collect the award on their behalf.Mr Abdel Fattah rose to prominence during the 2011 uprising in Egypt that forced long-time President Hosni Mubarak to resign.He spent most of his time in prison after 2014, the year after Sisi led the military's overthrow of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Morsi, following anti-government protests.While in power, Sisi has overseen what human rights groups say is an unprecedented crackdown on dissent that has led to the detention of thousands of people.In 2015, a court sentenced Mr Abdel Fattah to five years in prison for participating in an unauthorised protest.In September 2019, only six months after he had been released on probation, he was arrested again and held in pre-trial detention for more than two years.He was convicted in December 2021 of \"spreading false news\" for sharing a post about a prisoner dying of torture and handed another five-year sentence following a trial that human rights groups said was grossly unfair.His 68-year-old mother, Leila, launched a 287-day hunger strike last September 2024 to protest against his imprisonment. She lost more than 40% of her original body weight and was twice admitted to hospital in London.",

    "body": "A young French campaigner, who set up an association to help victims of drugs violence and took their cause to President Emmanuel Macron, has lost a second brother to suspected criminal gangs in Marseille.Amine Kessaci's 20-year-old brother Mehdi was parking his car in the centre of the city, when a motorcycle drew up and the pillion passenger opened fire with a 9mm pistol.Their elder brother, Brahim, was murdered in 2020. He was shot and his charred body found in a burned-out car, a common method in gang killings known locally as a \"barbecue\".Marseille is renowned for worsening drugs wars, with rival gangs from high-immigration neighbourhoods in the north of the city battling over turf. While Amine's murdered elder brother, Brahim, was known to have become involved with drugs gangs, investigators say that was not true of Mehdi, who had ambitions to become a policeman. They fear the murder was a warning aimed at Amine.\"That hypothesis is absolutely not being ruled out,\" said Marseille chief prosecutor Nicolas Bessone on French radio.\"And if it turns out to be the case, it will mean we have crossed another threshold.  It brings back certain terrible periods in our country's history, when you went out and killed people simply because they were from a family with whom you had problems.\"After his elder brother's murder, Amine set up a association called Conscience, which aims to help young people in Marseille's poor estates to escape the clutches of powerful drugs gangs.He was a high-school student at the time, and then last year ran unsuccessfully for the Green Party in European and legislative elections. He recently wrote a book called Marseille Wipe your Tears – Life and Death in a Land of Drugs and now, aged 22, he lives under police protection after receiving death threats.\"It's just so sad for my friend and for his mother,\" said Christine Juste, a Green Party city councillor in Marseille.\"No mother should go through that — losing two children. And I'm so angry that in France's second city,  people can be murdered so easily in plain daylight.\"Vendettas spawn successions of revenge murders, with killers sometimes as young as 15. So far there have been 14 drugs-related murders this year.Amine Kessaci's association, Conscience, has branches in several other towns and cities. Its main activities involve providing help and advice to families who have lost sons in drugs violence, and creating links between ex-delinquents and employers.When he was 17, Amine was selected to meet Emmanuel Macron when the president came to Marseille in 2021 to discuss projects to improve life in the city.  A local newspaper dubbed him in its headline: \"The kid from the estates who has Macron's ear.\"Explaining his decision to run for election the young campaigner wrote in his book: \"Politics never held out its hand to me, so I decided to grab it by the throat. Brahim – it was you who threw me into politics the day you burned in a car.\"",

    "body": "A man who jumped over a barricade and grabbed actress Ariana Grande at a Wicked: For Good premiere in Singapore has been charged with being a public nuisance. A now viral video shows the Australian man, Johnson Wen, pushing past photographers and charging at Grande while the cast made its way down a yellow carpet surrounded by fans. Co-star Cynthia Erivo could be seen wrestling the stunned actress away from Mr Wen. The 26-year-old had posted on Instagram late on Thursday that he was \"free after being arrested\". However, on Friday afternoon, he was charged with being a public nuisance by a Singapore court.  The incident caused massive outrage in the city state.Local media reports say Mr Wen, who was unrepresented, intends to plead guilty. This is not the first time Mr Wen, who describes himself as a \"Troll Most Hated\", has invaded a concert or event. His Instagram feed includes clips of him disrupting other celebrity events, including jumping on stage at Katy Perry's Sydney concert in June this year. He did the same at a concert by The Chainsmokers last December.If found guilty, he may be fined up to S$2000 ($1540; £1170). Fans had earlier called for him to be arrested and deported. \"There needs to be action [taken] against him as this is clearly a criminal offence,\" wrote an Instagram user, in a comment a video Mr Wen posted of his act.  \"Oh wow so you do this a lot... how aren't you in jail?\" one Instagram user wrote. Several accused Mr Wen of \"re-traumatising\" Grande, who has spoken of experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder after a suicide bomb attack at the end of her May 2017 concert in Manchester, killing 22 people and injuring hundreds.\"Ariana has been through so many scary things... and at her Manchester concert and you thought it would be fun to jump the barricade?\" said another comment on Instagram. Some fans also criticised security officers at the Thursday event for not being vigilant enough; while others called for social media platforms to ban Mr Wen's videos.In clips circulating online, Grande appeared shocked when she was grabbed by the intruder. Her co-stars Michelle Yeoh and Erivo can be seen comforting her while Mr Wen was escorted away by security.Grande has not commented on the incident, and the rest of the event proceeded as planned.The BBC has reached out to Singapore's police and immigration authority for comment.Hundreds of fans had gathered in a sea of green and pink at the Wicked: For Good Asia-Pacific premiere in a Singapore mall, including some who had stood in line for as long as eight hours before it began.The movie, to be released on 21 November, is the second of a two-part adaptation of the popular Broadway and West End musical Wicked, which centres on the unlikely friendship between two very different witches.The musical itself is a spin-off of the 1900 children's novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.Grande, who plays the good witch Glinda, was decked out in a champagne pink sequin dress at the premiere while Erivo, who plays the wicked witch, wore a black tube grown embroidered with roses.They were joined by co-star Jeff Goldblum who plays the wizard.The first movie, Wicked, was the highest-grossing movie of 2024 in the UK, and scored 10 Oscar nominations, winning two for best costume and production design.",

    "body": "3 hours agoKhanyisile Ngcobo,Johannesburg and Wycliffe Muia,NairobiGift of the GiversAbout 23 of them have since left for other destinations, authorities saySouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa says there will be an investigation into the \"mysterious\" arrival of a chartered plane carrying 153 Palestinians from Gaza into the country.The group arrived at OR Tambo International Airport but were initially refused entry and were stuck in the plane for more than 10 hours as they \"did not have the customary departure stamps in their passports\", local authorities said.Most were eventually allowed in after intervention from a local charity and because of the government's \"empathy [and] compassion\", Ramaphosa said.The circumstances of their departure from Gaza and travel to South Africa remain unclear.South Africa has maintained strong support for the Palestinian cause throughout the war between Hamas and Israel in Gaza.Ramaphosa said the group \"somehow mysteriously were put on a plane that passed by Nairobi\" and flew to South Africa, reports the News24 site.Israeli military body Cogat, which controls Gaza's crossings, said in a statement: \"The residents left the Gaza Strip after Cogat received approval from a third country to receive them.\" It did not specify the country.According to the Palestinian embassy in South Africa, the group left Israel's Ramon Airport and flew to the country via the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, \"without any prior note or coordination\".A statement from the embassy said \"an unregistered and misleading organization [had] exploited the tragic humanitarian conditions of our people in Gaza, deceived families, collected money from them, and facilitated their travel in an irregular and irresponsible manner\". Of the 153, 23 managed to fly on to other destinations, leaving 130 who were admitted into the country, South African authorities say.Ramaphosa, speaking during an event in Johannesburg, said he was informed of the unfolding crisis by the home affairs minister.In response, the president said \"we cannot turn them back\", according to News24.\"Even though they do not have the necessary documents and papers, these are people from a strife-torn, a war-torn country.\"The president also told reporters the South African government would carry out a \"proper evaluation\" of the matter and update the public on \"what is happening and how this matter came to be where it is\", according to public broadcaster SABC.Home Affairs Minister Leon Schreiber said that while Palestinian passport-holders qualified for 90-day visa-exempt access to South Africa, the lack of departure stamps, return tickets or accommodation addresses in some of the travellers' documentation resulted in the initial refusal to let them into the country.Once it was established that the absence of this information \"did not indicate that the travellers wished to apply for asylum\" and their accommodation was confirmed, they were granted entry.\"All of the travellers are in possession of valid passports and, at present, none of them have applied for asylum,\" he said.South African charity Gift of the Givers has said it will provide the group with accommodation in the country.Civil societies in South Africa have called for investigations into the conditions the Palestinians had fled in Gaza and the exact route of the aircraft.One of the Palestinians who spoke to local eNCA TV expressed his relief to be in South Africa, describing it as a country of \"peace, laws and justice\".  \"We came from Gaza where we've faced death on daily basis. We have survived a war of two years and we are lucky to be here,\" said one man who had fled with his wife and two children. Gift of the Givers has since called for Ramaphosa to investigate the home affairs ministry and border authority for the \"humiliation they've caused\" the Palestinians.The organisation's founder Dr Imtiaz Sooliman said this treatment included being forced to wait for hours on the tarmac at the airport, being denied food provided by the group and \"using every excuse in the book to prevent these passengers from disembarking\".South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza.The country's sympathy for the Palestinian fight for an independent state goes back decades, particularly the early 1990s when anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela pledged support for the Palestinian cause.Large pro-Palestinian marches have been held around South Africa since the conflict began.Smaller pro-Israel marches and rallies have been held in the country, which hosts the largest Jewish community in sub-Saharan Africa.In 2023, the South African government filed a case against Israel with the International Court of Justice, accusing it of genocide in Gaza. Israel has strongly rejected the South African claim, calling it \"baseless\".You may also be interested in: Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "13 hours agoMadeline HalpertKristy GammonMs Gammon and her husband used to enjoy travelling to the US to go to Baltimore Orioles gamesKristy Gammon used to travel to the US from Canada at least once every other year, taking ski trips at Lake Placid in New York and travelling to Baltimore, Maryland, for her husband's favourite Orioles baseball games.But those trips are now over, she said. This year, the Nova Scotia resident has avoided even passing through the US on her way to Ontario, a shortcut for an otherwise 18-hour drive.Since President Donald Trump took office earlier this year, the 62-year-old said she and most of her Canadian friends have decided to stop visiting the US as a way of protesting policies they oppose and trade actions Trump has taken against Canada.\"There are so many things that we just feel aghast about in terms of how [the administration] is acting internationally, behaving toward their own citizens, how they're treating their allies and neighbours, i.e. Canada,\" Ms Gammon said.Ms Gammon and her friends are part of a trend that shows no signs of slowing. October marked the 10th straight month of decline in the number of Canadian travellers to the US. Air travel from Canada to the US dropped nearly 24%, while car travel fell more than 30% when compared to the same period last year, according to data released this week by Canada's statistics office.Overall, the US has seen a 3.2% drop in international spending in the country, driven primarily by fewer visitors from Canada, according to the US Travel Association, a nonprofit group representing the American travel industry.As relations between the two countries remain icy, mostly in response to new tariffs Trump has imposed, Canadians are apparently committed to giving their southern neighbours the cold shoulder.In the past, Canadians have made up about a quarter of all international visitors to the US, spending over $20bn (£15.1bn) a year, according to the US Travel Association.They began to curb their US travel after Trump imposed a series of tariffs on goods from the country earlier this year, saying he wanted to reduce the trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods the US buys from Canada and those it sells to them. Trump also said Canada should do more to reduce the flow of illegal drug fentanyl into the US.Canada is currently facing 35% tariffs on its goods - although most are exempt under an existing North American free trade agreement - as well as individual levies targeting particular industries like car and steel manufacturing.Trade talks between the two countries were derailed last month when Trump was angered by an anti-tariff advertisement in the US that featured Ronald Reagan and was sponsored by the province of Ontario.Meanwhile, he has angered Canadians with his many public comments about making their country the \"51st state\".Some popular tourist destinations in US have tried to buck the trend, attempting to entice Canadian travellers back to the US. In Kalispell, Montana, home to Glacier National Park, officials have been offering a \"Canadian Welcome Pass\" that includes deals and discounts at local businesses for those crossing the border.\"For the last several months, our countries have been going through some things. But there's one thing we know and it's this – we miss you,\" the website for the welcome pass says.Major events scheduled to take place in the US in the coming years could help drive visitors from other places and replace the missing Canadian tourists, including the FIFA 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, according to the US Travel Association.'Come hug it out!' - How a Canadian tourism ad went viralStill, with Canadians choosing to travel closer to home, the country's own tourism industry has gotten a boost. Canada's tourism sector made a record-breaking C$59bn from May to August of 2025, up 6% from the same period last year, mostly because of people choosing to travel domestically, according to Destination Canada, a national tourism organisation.Some of those choosing to stay home are Canadian snowbirds, retirees who travel south to states like Florida to find warmth in the winter months. A survey from the Travel Health Insurance Association of Canada found these baby boomers were staying home more than other age groups, with only 10% planning US trips for this year, down 66% compared to last year.Ms Gammon said some of her friends have even chosen to sell their winter homes in Florida because of the frosty relations and frustrations with the Trump administration.\"They've completely changed their snowbird plans,\" the semi-retired family physician said. \"You can feel there's a shift.\"Ms Gammon said she did not know if others would stick to boycotting the US for the remaining three years of the Trump administration. But, even though she misses her US trips, that is her plan for now.\"Who knows what could change between now and three years,\" Ms Gammon said. \"But it would have to be pretty significant changes for us personally to change our minds.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoImogen FoulkesIn BernAPTrump was pictured on Monday apparently with the Swiss gifts on his desk in the Oval OfficeSwiss ministers have had \"very positive\" talks in Washington, US officials say, in a bid to cut US President Donald Trump's steep 39% tariffs on Swiss exports to the US – the highest in Europe.One senior US official said the Swiss were \"very aware\" of their trade deficit and were prepared to address it - hopefully leading to a \"meaningful reduction\" in tariffs.Swiss economics minister Guy Parmelin, meanwhile, said the two sides had \"clarified almost everything\" in the talks. Switzerland been trying to bring down the tariff rate - which has hit the country hard - for months.Swiss industry chiefs came to the Oval Office on 4 November bearing gifts,  including a Rolex gold watch and a specially engraved gold bar from Swiss-based gold refining company MKS.Initial attempts by Swiss President Karin Keller Sutter to change Trump's mind fell on deaf ears. However, a private business initiative last week may have made all the difference. Trump's response to the Swiss president's bid was that she \"was a nice woman, but she did not want to listen\".But after last week's private business initiative Trump said a deal was being worked on to bring the tariffs \"a little bit lower… I haven't set any number\".For Swiss industry, that deal could not come soon enough. Tech exports to the US are down 14.2% on the third quarter of last year, according to latest statistics - a dramatic fall since the tariff hike was imposed in August.Some figures in Swiss business, particularly those trading in luxury goods, gold, or commodities, already had contacts in Trump's circle.In September, Trump appeared at the US Open tennis final in the Rolex VIP box hosted by the Swiss watch company's chief executive Jean Frédéric Dufour. MANDEL NGAN/AFPJean Frédéric Dufour and Trump stood together in the Rolex VIP box in New York in SeptemberThe president, apparently guessing what was going on, even asked if Dufour would have been there if Trump had not slapped such steep tariffs on Switzerland.Last week Dufour met Trump again, this time in the Oval Office, along with fellow business leaders including Johann Rupert from luxury goods maker Richemont and Marwan Shakarchi from MKS.It is quite normal nowadays for any leader heading to the Oval Office to come bearing a gift.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer brought an invitation from King Charles for a lavish state visit. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz offered a framed copy of Trump's German grandfather's birth certificate.Requests for confirmation of the gifts to the two Swiss companies involved brought a \"no comment\" from Rolex and MKS.But days after the meeting, Trump was pictured in the Oval Office with what looked very much like a Rolex \"Datejust\" desk clock, produced by the company as a collector's item, and worth tens of thousands of dollars.BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFPThe Rolex desk clock was pictured on Trump's desk on MondayA White House official confirmed the two items had been given to Trump.The US president receives thousands of gifts every year and they then become US property, deposited with the National Archives and filed annually by the state department. They are eventually transferred to a presidential library. Some gifts can be kept but presidents have to pay federal taxes if they do not come from a close relative.In 1969, President Richard Nixon gently refused the gift of a Swiss Omega watch to commemorate the Moon landings.Whatever happens to the Swiss gifts, Trump's stance towards the Swiss appears to be softening, telling reporters he is working on something \"to help Switzerland\".Swiss economy minister Guy Parmelin and chief trade negotiator Helene Budliger Artieda, who travelled to Washington on Wednesday, are more hopeful than they have been in months, amid suggestions that 39% tariff may be reduced to 15% - the same as Switzerland's neighbours in the EU.In return, promises from the Swiss pharmaceutical giants to build more production plants in the US are already on the table. It is also reported that Swiss International Airlines, whose fleet is primarily Airbus, may pivot towards Boeing.But will it be enough? Swiss industry is waiting with bated breath. A number of Swiss companies have warned they will have to furlough staff if nothing changes.The Swiss do have one more highly influential figure they can call on.Fifa president and Swiss citizen Gianni Infantino, long a friend of Trump's, was reportedly urged by some Swiss parliamentarians to try to change the president's mind.As part of preparations for next year's World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico, Infantino visited the Oval Office in August bearing the trophy.As the cameras rolled, he handed it to Trump saying he was \"a winner\". The president responded asking \"can I keep it? That's a beautiful piece of gold\".Infantino has also announced a brand new Fifa world peace prize, to be announced in Washington DC on 5 December.All bets are off as to who that might be.",

    "body": "4 hours agoAmy Walker and Simon Atkinson,SydneyDozens of schools and preschools across Australia and New Zealand have been fully or partially closed after a warning over asbestos risks in children's sand.A recall notice for the coloured products, which were found to contain traces of tremolite asbestos, was issued by the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) on Wednesday.The regulator said there was a \"low\" risk that the asbestos could become airborne or fine enough for inhalation, but it \"may still pose a risk\".New Zealand's Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) has also urged people to stop using the sand and arrange for safe disposal \"through licensed professionals\".On Friday, at least 15 schools and seven preschools in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) - where Canberra is situated - were fully closed, with six others partially closed as a precaution. There are also reports of a school closure in Queensland.In New Zealand, the Ministry of Education said on Friday that five early learning services and two schools would close temporarily while licensed professionals addressed possible asbestos contamination, public broadcast RNZ reported.In an earlier statement on Wednesday, MBIE product safety spokesperson Ian Caplin urged those who had bought the products to \"act immediately\".\"Stop using the sand, contain it, secure it in a safe place and arrange for safe disposal through licensed professionals, a list of these is available on the WorkSafe website,\" he said.The ACCC said tremolite asbestos, a naturally occurring asbestos, had been detected in some samples after laboratory testing. But it added that respiratory asbestos had not been detected in any of the samples and the release of respiratory asbestos fibres from the sand was \"unlikely\" unless it was \"processed by mechanical means\" such as crushing or pulverising.Asbestos becomes dangerous when fibres are breathed in. They can damage the lungs and cause diseases including cancer.Importing or exporting asbestos or goods containing asbestos is prohibited under both Australian and New Zealand law.The sand products, which are imported from China and sold throughout Australia between 2020 and 2025, are sold by several stationery supply chains, including one of the country's most popular retailers, Officeworks.The products set out in the recall notice are labelled as Kadink Sand (1.3kg), Educational Colours - Rainbow Sand (1.3kg) and Creatistics - Coloured Sand (1kg).The BBC has contacted supplier Educational Colours Pty Ltd - which issued the recall - for comment.Officeworks said it had stopped selling the Educational Colours products after tests detected the asbestos, according to Australian broadcaster ABC.It added that it had obtained an independent health and safety risk assessment which found that \"the safety risk associated with these products is negligible\".New Zealand's MBIE said it had been notified that a voluntary recall for two products sold in the country - EC Rainbow Sand (1.3kg) and Creatistics - Coloured Sand (1kg products) - was underway.It added that it was taking \"precautionary action\" while it established the extent of the risk posed by the \"potentially contaminated product\".Yvette Berry, the ACT's education minister, said on social media that the products were \"used at some of our public schools for sensory play, and arts and crafts\".\"I understand that this news might be upsetting for families,\" she added. \"Closing schools will allow testing and remediation to occur as soon as possible\".A spokesperson for the state of Victoria confirmed no state schools will close there over the warning, saying they'd been advised \"the health risk from the use of these products is low\".\"As such, there is no indication of a need to close schools or early childhood services at this time,\" they added.The spokesperson said officials were working \"swiftly\" to identify schools and early childhood services that may be using the recalled products, and will then support them to follow the remediation advice from relevant authorities.In New South Wales, where there have also been no school closures, a safety alert was sent to all public schools to \"immediately and safely remove these sand products if they have them\".\"The health, safety, and wellbeing of students, staff, and the school community is the department's highest priority,\" they added.",

    "body": "Call of Duty is back, and it's got a battle on its hands30 minutes agoTom Richardson,BBC Newsbeat and Mel Ramsay,BBC NewsActivisionActress Kiernan Shipka takes a central role in Black Ops 7's campaignThere are some things you can always rely on, and a new Call of Duty game coming out each year is one of them.As one of the best-known names in video games, it's a series that needs little introduction.According to publisher Activision, it's sold an estimated 500 million copies, a movie adaptation is on the way, and despite having launched in 2003 it still reliably appears at - or near - the top of the annual bestseller charts.But this year the world's top military shooter might have a fight on its hands.Battlefield 6, which has been a huge hit for rival gaming giant Electronic Arts, has been drawing attention away from its veteran competitor.And long-time Call of Duty fans have been increasingly vocal over worries about the series losing touch with its routes.The clash of the multiplayer titans comes at an interesting time for the makers of Call of Duty, who've had to issue responses to fan concerns about the series losing its way.It has long offered players the chance to purchase \"operator skins\" that change their character's appearance. They're a frequent source of brand crossovers, and previous designs have been based on stars including footballer Neymar Jr, streamer NickMercs and rapper Nicki Minaj.But when Activision revealed skins based on 90s cartoon characters Beavis and Butthead earlier this year, there was a backlash.Fans accused the company of trying to mimic Fortnite, the ever-popular multiplayer game famous for its sometimes unlikely crossovers, which have included pop star Sabrina Carpenter and an AI-voiced Darth Vader in 2025.Activision said the feedback from fans \"hit home\" and that it took the complaints about the series losing its identity seriously.It's also being released after parent company Microsoft increased prices of its Game Pass subscription service by 20%, angering many players.ActivisionBlack Ops games thrust players into a world of espionage and conspiracyWhen BBC News sits down with lead producer Natalie Pohorski and senior comms director Stephanie Snowdon, they're keen to talk up Black Ops 7's single-player story campaign.The equivalent mode in Battlefield 6 was considered underwhelming by reviewers, and Call of Duty teams are renowned for their skill in crafting explosive set pieces in their narrative modes.Black Ops-themed installments of the series usually tell Hollywood blockbuster-style stories of secret agents uncovering vast conspiracies.Black Ops 7 is a direct sequel to 2012's Black Ops 2, set in 2035 and tells a story involving a global terrorist threat and a murky big tech company.Natalie says that the \"Black Ops identity\" allows the developers to explore themes that others can't.\"There's a lot of really interesting and timeless ideas... there's endless ways to explore them,\" she says.\"And then we ask a lot of questions that could apply to any era - questions of trust, can you believe what you're seeing?\" ActivisionMilo Ventimiglia takes over the role of hero David MasonBeing one of the biggest names in gaming also allows Activision to attract some big-name talent to Call of Duty projects.For Black Ops 7, that includes Kiernan Shipka, best known for her role in Netflix's Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, and This Is Us star Milo Ventimiglia.Kiernan tells BBC News she's aware of Call of Duty's huge profile, and the expectations of its fans.She says being involved was \"honestly more exciting than anything.\" \"I love a fandom,\" she says.\"And I think that when something over time garners such passion from fans, that means you're stepping into something really cool.\"The reaction is going to be what the reaction is going to be.\"If I let that stuff in, that's not a good thing.\" As someone who played Call of Duty when he was younger, Milo says he's also aware of the standards fans have.\"I mean, I hope I don't muck it up for anybody,\" he says. Asked whether he thinks players are getting \"fatigued\" with the annual series, he says Black Ops 7 won't disappoint.\"I think this one just blows the others out of the water completely in the storytelling and where we go,\" he says. But Call of Duty's campaigns, no matter how well-crafted or explosive they are, aren't the main reason players turn up for the series each year.The game owes its long-running success to the popularity of its multiplayer modes, and the performance of Black Ops 7 will be judged on whether they succeed.When they're asked if Battlefield's impressive player numbers affect their approach to development, Natalie and Stephanie insist they're only focused on making Black Ops 7 \"the best game it can be\".As for what it offers that Battlefield can't, Stephanie says, without directly comparing the two, that Call of Duty has \"variety and volume\" of experiences to offer.\"But more broadly, she says, \"I see games as a way for people to connect, to have fun. \"They are certainly responsible for some awesome relationships in my life.\"I hope that people continue to forge those connections and bonds and  relationships and there's just more of us playing games together in however many years from now.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "Israel has identified the hostage body returned by Hamas on Thursday as that of Meny Godard, who was 73 when he was killed in the 7 October attacks. Red Cross vehicles collected his body hours after Hamas issued a joint statement with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad saying it had been located in the Khan Younis area of southern Gaza.The Israeli prime minister's office said forensic testing confirmed the body belonged to Godard, who was killed along with his wife, Ayelet, during Hamas's raid on kibbutz Be'eri on 7 October 2023.Hamas has now returned all 20 living hostages, and 25 out of 28 deceased hostages, under the first phase of the ceasefire deal - part of a US plan to end the Gaza war.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.For each dead Israeli hostage returned, Israel has agreed to hand over the remains of 15 Palestinians. But with no DNA testing available in Gaza, it is hard to identify them.Hamas seized 251 hostages when it launched the deadly attack in southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which it killed 1,200 people. More than 69,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's retaliatory response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, whose figures the UN considers reliable.Of the three bodies still in Gaza, two are Israeli and one is Thai.Israel has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the hostages' bodies, but Hamas has said it is struggling to find them under rubble.The slow progress has meant there has been no advance on the second phase of US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan. This includes plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas, and reconstruction of the Gaza Strip.",

    "body": "3 hours agoToby Luckhurst,In Kyiv and Ottilie Mitchell'Astonishingly lethal': James Landale reports from site of deadly Russian strikeA Russian drone has slammed into a block of flats in eastern Kyiv, killing six people and wounding dozens of others, during a wave of strikes throughout the Ukrainian capital.As emergency workers sifted through the wreckage in the Lisovyi area, one Kyiv resident called Vita described how the drone had pierced the building, exploding on the other side.Meanwhile, Ukraine stepped up its attacks on Russia's oil infrastructure, with drone strikes on one of its biggest export terminals in Novorossiysk, on the Black Sea coast.Fire broke out at the Sheskharis oil refinery, and a ship and a block of flats were hit, officials said.Krasnodar governor Veniamin Kondratyev said three crew members and another man were hurt in the attack which damaged the main oil depot and a container terminal.Mayor Andrei Kravchenko declared a state of emergency and Reuters reported that oil exports were suspended.President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine had fired long-range \"Long Neptune\" cruise missiles during its attacks on Russia overnight, without specifying what they targeted.ReutersKyiv fire service said the drone destroyed several floors of the entire block of flatsCondemning Russia's overnight attacks as vile and calculated, Zelensky said about 430 drones and 18 missiles had been launched and dozens of high-rise buildings damaged. A drone attack on a market at Chornomorsk in the south of the country killed two people.In Kyiv, residential buildings came under attack \"in practically every district\", the head of the city's military administration Tymur Tkachenko said on Telegram.He issued a warning to take shelter a minute after midnight local time on Thursday night, writing \"it's loud in Kyiv\".Watch: Kyiv air defences downing Russian drones and missiles during attackThe fire service in the Lisovyi neighbourhood said later the drone had hit the seventh floor of the residential building. When it exploded all the floors - from the eighth down to the fourth - collapsed, a spokesman told the BBC.Vita said she saw four bodies being pulled out of the apartment a few doors down from hers: \"I saw it with my own eyes.\"Two cranes hoisted emergency workers outside the block, as crews combed through the destroyed building, throwing broken sections of wall and shattered glass to the ground.Falling debris and fires damaged several high-rise apartment buildings, a hospital, school and administrative buildings, according to emergency services. Oleh Kiper/TelegramA drone killed at least two people at a market in Chornomorsk in southern UkraineMore than 40 people were rescued, they added, including 14 from a fire in a residential building. Another person was rescued after being pulled from beneath the rubble, they said.Kyiv's energy infrastructure was badly hit, leaving some buildings in the capital without heat, officials said. \"The attack was massive, with drones, with ballistic [missiles], with lots of air defence working,\" Ukrainian MP Lisa Yasko told the BBC. \"Very often there was the feeling that your bed was just shaking  together with the windows.\"Medical teams were deployed to all fires, officials said, while Mayor Vitali Klitschko said nine people were being treated in hospital with one man in an \"extremely serious condition\".ReutersWitnesses described how a Russian drone pierced the entire block of flats in Kyiv before explodingUkraine's air force warned drones and guided bombs had been targeting several other regions, including Sumy.The overnight strikes follow the deaths of six people in another Russian offensive less than a week ago that also damaged residential buildings and energy infrastructure. Russia says its attacks on energy targets - now a familiar part of the war - are aimed at the Ukrainian military, although Kyiv has long rejected that claim.",

    "body": "China summons Japan ambassador as war of words over Taiwan drags on8 hours agoKoh EweKyodo via ReutersJapanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi (left) met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea on 31 OctoberChina has summoned the Japanese ambassador in Beijing over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's comments on Taiwan.China and Japan have been locked in an escalating war of words this week, set off by Takaichi's suggestion that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan.Both countries' foreign ministries have lodged serious protests with each other. A Chinese diplomat also made a comment which some interpreted as a threat to behead Takaichi. The spat touches on the historical animosity between China and Japan, as well as longstanding \"strategic ambiguity\" on the sovereignty of self-governed Taiwan.Here's what else you need to know about it:What happened? A timelineThe current tensions were sparked at a parliamentary meeting in Japan last Friday, when an opposition lawmaker asked Takaichi what circumstances surrounding Taiwan would count as a survival-threatening situation for Japan.\"If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation,\" Takaichi responded.A \"survival-threatening situation\" is a legal term under Japan's 2015 security law, referring to when an armed attack on its allies poses an existential threat to Japan. In such a situation, Japan's self-defence forces can be activated to respond to the threat.Takaichi's remarks drew immediate ire from Beijing, with China's foreign ministry describing them as \"egregious\".On Saturday, Xue Jian, China's consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka, reshared a news article about Takaichi's parliamentary remarks on X. But he also added his own comment that \"the dirty head that sticks itself in must be cut off\".While the intent of Xue's remarks \"may not be clear\", they were \"highly inappropriate\", Japan's chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters on Monday.Tokyo lodged protests with China over Xue's remarks, while Beijing lodged its own with Japan over Takaichi's.Xue's post has since been taken down - but the dust from the barbed exchanges hasn't settled yet.On Tuesday, Takaichi declined to retract her remarks, which she defended as \"consistent with the government's traditional position\". She did note, however, that she would be careful about commenting on specific scenarios from now on.Then on Thursday, China's foreign ministry posted in Japanese and English on its X account, warning Japan to \"stop playing with fire\" and added that it would be an \"act of aggression\" if Japan \"dares to meddles in the cross-Strait situation\".Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong also summoned the Japanese ambassador to China that same day to express their unhappiness.Sun called Takaichi's remarks \"extremely wrong and dangerous\" and demanded that Japan withdraw the comments, according to state media Xinhua. He also warned that \"otherwise all consequences must be borne by Japan\".Japan's ambassador explained that their position on Taiwan \"has not changed\" and refuted Beijing's remarks, Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters on Friday. \"It is the consistent position of the Japanese government that we hope for a peaceful resolution of issues surrounding Taiwan through dialogue,\" he said during the daily news briefing.Kihara also added that Japan \"strongly urged China to take appropriate action\" over Xue's social media comment.A long history of animosityThere is longstanding animosity between the two countries, which can be traced back to a series of armed conflicts in the 1800s and Japan's brutal military campaign in China during World War Two.This was referenced in a statement released by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday when it said that \"should Japan fail to draw lessons from history and dare to take reckless risks, even resorting to military intervention in the Taiwan Strait situation, it will inevitably suffer heavy losses and pay a bitter price in the face of the iron wall of the Chinese People's Liberation Army\".Historical grievances have remained sore spots in bilateral relations ever since. But the recent ascension of Takaichi, a protégé of the late former prime minister Shinzo Abe, suggests more tensions may lie ahead.The conservative leader is pursuing closer ties with the US and has pledged to increase Japan's defence spending - raising some alarm in Beijing.Getty ImagesThe US and Japan have been deliberately ambiguous on how they would respond, should China invade TaiwanTakaichi is also famously hawkish on China and a longtime supporter of Taiwan. She had previously said that a blockade of the island could threaten Japan, and that Japan could mobilise its troops to stop a Chinese invasion.China is especially touchy about Taiwan, the self-governed island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. China has not ruled out the use of force to take Taiwan - a posture that has unsettled Taipei and its allies in the region.Earlier this month, Beijing accused Takaichi of violating the one-China principle, after she posted photos of herself meeting a senior Taiwanese official on the sidelines of the Apec summit in South Korea.Why Takaichi's recent comments caused such a stirThe Japanese prime minister's recent comments mark a departure from the equivocal position that the country has traditionally adopted on the status of Taiwan.This is in line with the policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" that the US has long maintained: remaining vague about what it would do to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.For decades, this ambiguity has kept China guessing - a form of deterrence - while leaving room for economic ties to flourish.The Japanese government's official stance is that it hopes the Taiwan issue can be resolved peacefully through dialogue - and Japanese officials have typically avoided mentioning Taiwan in public discussions about security.On the occasions where they have, they have been met with sharp rebuke from Beijing.In 2021, when then deputy prime minister Taro Aso said that Japan would need to defend Taiwan alongside the US in the event of an invasion, Beijing condemned his remarks and told Japan to \"correct its mistakes\".In this more recent flare-up, China's foreign ministry said that Takaichi's remarks were \"a gross interference in China's internal affairs\".\"Taiwan is China's Taiwan,\" ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a press briefing on Monday, adding that China would not \"tolerate any foreign interference\" on the matter.\"What signal is the Japanese leader trying to send to 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces?\" he added. \"Is Japan up to challenge China's core interests and stop its reunification?\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterReuters / AFP via Getty ImagesThe BBC has apologised to US President Donald Trump for a Panorama episode that spliced parts of his 6 January 2021 speech together, but rejected his demands for compensation.The corporation said the edit had given \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action\" and said it would not show the 2024 programme again.Lawyers for Trump have threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn (£759m) in damages unless the corporation issues a retraction, apologises and compensates him. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy told BBC Breakfast she was confident the corporation was \"gripping this with the seriousness that it demands\", adding her role was to ensure \"the highest standards are upheld\".But she also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the BBC's editorial standards and guidelines were \"in some cases not robust enough and in other cases not consistently applied\", adding that there would need to be people \"at a very senior level with a journalistic background\".Political appointments to the corporation's board would be examined in the BBC's charter review, she said in response to a question asking if member Sir Robbie Gibb, a former political adviser to Theresa May, had overstepped his remit and weighed into politics.While this was a matter for the board and its chairman, she said, those appointments \"damaged confidence and trust in the BBC's impartiality\".Liberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey had urged the prime minister on Thursday to \"get on the phone to Trump\" to put a stop to his lawsuit threat and \"defend the impartiality and independence of the BBC\".The fallout from the scandal led to the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness on Sunday.BBC News has approached the White House for comment.The apology comes hours after a second similarly edited clip, broadcast on Newsnight in 2022, was revealed by the Daily Telegraph.In its Corrections and Clarifications section, published on Thursday evening, the BBC said the Panorama programme had been reviewed after criticism of how Trump's speech had been edited.The BBC had been given a deadline of 22:00 GMT (17:00 EST) on Friday to respond. \"We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" the statement said.Lawyers for the BBC have written to President Trump's legal team in response to a letter received on Sunday, a BBC spokesperson said. \"BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" they said.They added: \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\"Why is Donald Trump threatening to sue the BBC?Trump vs the BBC: What hurdles might the president's legal argument face?In Trump's speech he said: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"More than 50 minutes later in the speech, he said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"In the Panorama programme the clip shows him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"Speaking to Fox News, Trump said his speech had been \"butchered\" and the way it was presented had \"defrauded\" viewers.The BBC received the letter from Trump's lawyers on Sunday. It demands a \"full and fair retraction\" of the documentary, an apology, and that the BBC \"appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused\".Watch: How the BBC works... in under two minutesIn its letter to Trump's legal team, the BBC sets out five main arguments for why it does not think it has a case to answer.First it says the BBC did not have the rights to, and did not, distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels.When the documentary was available on BBC iPlayer, it was restricted to viewers in the UK.Secondly, it says the documentary did not cause Trump harm, as he was re-elected shortly after.Thirdly, it says the clip was not designed to mislead, but just to shorten a long speech, and that the edit was not done with malice.Fourthly, it says the clip was never meant to be considered in isolation. Rather, it was 12 seconds within an hour-long programme, which also contained lots of voices in support of Trump.Finally, an opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the US.A BBC insider said that internally, there is a strong belief in the case the corporation has put forward, and in its defence.Fresh claim of misleading editEarlier on Thursday, the BBC was accused of another misleading edit of Trump's 6 January 2021 speech, two years before the Panorama sequence aired.On a Newsnight programme from 2022, the edit is a little different from Panorama.Trump is shown as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol. And we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women. And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not gonna have a country anymore.\"This was followed by a voiceover from presenter Kirsty Wark saying \"and fight they did\" over footage from the Capitol riots.Responding to the clip on the same programme, former White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who quit a diplomatic post and became a critic of Trump after describing the 6 January riots as an \"attempted coup\", said the video had \"spliced together\" Trump's speech.\"That line about 'we fight and fight like hell' is actually later in the speech and yet your video makes it look like those two things came together,\" he said.In response to Thursday's story in the Telegraph, a BBC spokesperson said the BBC holds itself to the \"highest editorial standards\" and the matter was being looked into.A spokesman for Trump's legal team told the Telegraph it was \"now clear that BBC engaged in a pattern of defamation against President Trump\".Concerns over the Trump Panorama documentary emerged when a leaked internal memo, written by a former independent external adviser to the corporation's editorial standards committee, was published by the Telegraph newspaper. Among other things, the document also criticised the BBC's reporting of trans issues, and BBC Arabic's coverage of the Israel-Gaza war.",

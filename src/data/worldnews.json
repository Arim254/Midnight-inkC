    "body": "US President Donald Trump has said he will take legal action against the BBC over how his speech was edited by Panorama, after the corporation apologised but refused to compensate him.Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One on Friday evening, Trump said: \"We'll sue them for anywhere between $1bn [£759m] and $5bn, probably sometime next week.\"On Thursday, the BBC said the edit of the 6 January 2021 speech had unintentionally given \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action\" and said it would not be broadcast again.The corporation apologised to the president but said it would not pay financial compensation.The BBC released that statement after Trump's lawyers threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn in damages unless the corporation issued a retraction, apology and paid him compensation. \"I think I have to do it,\" Trump told reporters of his plan to take legal action. \"They cheated. They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\"The president said he had not raised the issue with Sir Keir Starmer but that the prime minister had asked to speak to him. Trump said he would call Starmer over the weekend.A search of public court record databases confirmed that no lawsuit had been filed in federal or state court in Florida as of Friday evening.In a separate interview on Saturday recorded before his comments on Air Force One, Trump said said he had an \"obligation\" to sue the BBC, adding: \"If you don't do it, you don't stop it from happening again with other people.\"He called the edit \"egregious\" and \"worse than the Kamala thing\", a reference to a dispute he had with US news outlet CBS over an interview on the 60 Minutes programme with his 2024 election opponent Kamala Harris.In July this year, US media company Paramount Global agreed to pay $16m (£13.5m) to settle a legal dispute over that interview.Watch: Trump says he will sue the BBC. Gary O'Donoghue explains what's nextThe controversy stems from the way in which Trump's 6 January 2021 speech was edited by Panorama for a documentary which aired in October 2024. During his address, he told supporters: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"More than 50 minutes later in the speech, he said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"In the Panorama programme the clip shows him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"Controversy around how Trump's speech was edited has led to the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness.In its Corrections and Clarifications section, published on Thursday evening, the BBC said the Panorama programme had been reviewed after criticism of how Trump's speech had been edited.\"We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" the statement said.Lawyers for the BBC have written to Trump's legal team, a BBC spokesperson said this week.\"BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" they said.They added: \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\"In its letter to Trump's legal team, the BBC set out five main arguments for why it did not think it had a case to answer.First it said the BBC did not have the rights to, and did not, distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels.When the documentary was available on BBC iPlayer, it was restricted to viewers in the UK.Secondly, it said the documentary did not cause Trump harm, as he was re-elected shortly after.Thirdly, it said the clip was not designed to mislead, but just to shorten a long speech, and that the edit was not done with malice.Fourthly, it said the clip was never meant to be considered in isolation. Rather, it was 12 seconds within an hour-long programme, which also contained lots of voices in support of Trump.Finally, an opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the US.The BBC's apology came hours after a second similarly edited clip, broadcast on Newsnight in 2022, was revealed by the Daily Telegraph.",

It is not clear if there were passengers on board. The incident occurred near the Royal Institute of Technology university.Images from the scene show rescue crews appearing to help people trapped underneath the double-decker bus.A witness who owns a shop on the street told SVT the bus hit a pole in front of the bus shelter. They said several people ran into the shop crying.A woman told the local Expressen newspaper that the bus \"mowed down an entire bus stop queue\". She said people were screaming and trying to help the injured, while dead people lay on the ground.\"There must have been more people under the bus,\" she said.Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said his thoughts were with the victims and their families.\"People who might have been on their way home to family, friends, or a quiet evening at home. We do not yet know the cause, but right now my thoughts are primarily with those affected and their loved ones,\" he posted on X.",

    "body": "6 hours agoDanielle Kaye,Business reporter and Nardine SaadUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order allowing a range of food products, including coffee, bananas and beef, to escape his sweeping tariffs.The move comes as his administration faces mounting pressure over rising prices. While Trump previously downplayed concerns about the cost of living, he has focused on the issue since his Republican Party's poor performance in last week's elections.The dozens of products included on the White House's list of exemptions range from avocados and tomatoes to coconuts and mangoes.These goods, the Trump administration said on Friday, cannot be produced in sufficient quantities domestically.Trump has long said that his tariffs - currently a baseline 10% on imports from all countries, with additional levies on many trading partners - would not lead to increased prices for US consumers. He also said affordability was a \"new word\" and a \"con job\" by Democrats.He has argued the taxes are necessary to reduce the US trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods it buys from other countries and those it sells to them. Trump has said the US has been exploited by \"cheaters\" and \"pillaged\" by foreigners, adding that higher levies would encourage those in the US to buy American goods instead. But grocery costs and the soaring price of beef has become a political issue for Trump. Last week, he called for an investigation into the meat-packing industry, accusing companies of \"Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation\".He has aimed to rally support for the taxes, offering $2,000 tariff rebate cheques to Americans - even as the US Supreme Court is currently weighing whether Trump had the legal authority to implement them.  But the latest exemptions signal a reversal by the Trump administration, as the White House seeks to lower prices by walking back levies on some food staples.Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said the decision will affect products that are not produced in the US, \"so there's no protection of our industries, or our food products\".He added that he doesn't think more policy rollbacks will be required in the future, saying \"I don't think it'll be necessary.\" \"We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods, like coffee as an example, where the prices of coffee were a little bit high. Now they'll be on the low side in a very short period of time,\" Trump said.Economists have warned that companies would pass the cost of tariffs onto their customers in the form of higher prices.While inflation remained milder than many analysts had expected in September, most items tracked in the Department of Labor inflation report showed price increases, with groceries up 2.7% from last year.The Trump administration's new tariff exemptions for food products take effect retroactively at midnight on Thursday 13 November, the White House said.In another move to address concerns among consumers about grocery prices, the Trump administration said import taxes on coffee and bananas will be lowered as part of trade deals with four Latin American countries.This week, Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both vowed to decrease coffee prices by 20% in the US this year.The White House released a list that includes more than 100 products no longer subject to the levies. Some of them include: CoffeeCocoaBlack teaGreen teaVanilla beansBeef products, including high-quality cuts, bone-in and boneless cuts, corned beef, some frozen items, as well as salted, brined, dried or smoked meatFruits, including as acai, avocadoes, bananas, coconuts, guavas, limes, oranges, mangoes, plantains, pineapples, various peppers and tomatoesSpices, including allspice, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, curry, dill fennel seeds, ginger, mace, nutmeg, oregano, paprika, saffron and turmericNuts, grains, roots and seeds, such as barley, Brazil nuts, capers, cashews, chestnuts, macadamia nuts, miso, palm hearts, pine nuts, poppy seeds, tapioca, taro and water chestnuts",

    "body": "A man who jumped over a barricade and grabbed actress Ariana Grande at a Wicked: For Good premiere in Singapore has been charged with being a public nuisance. A now viral video shows the Australian man, Johnson Wen, pushing past photographers and charging at Grande while the cast made its way down a yellow carpet surrounded by fans. Co-star Cynthia Erivo could be seen wrestling the stunned actress away from Mr Wen. The 26-year-old had posted on Instagram late on Thursday that he was \"free after being arrested\". However, on Friday afternoon, he was charged with being a public nuisance by a Singapore court.  The incident caused massive outrage in the city state.Local media reports say Mr Wen, who was unrepresented, intends to plead guilty. This is not the first time Mr Wen, who describes himself as a \"Troll Most Hated\", has invaded a concert or event. His Instagram feed includes clips of him disrupting other celebrity events, including jumping on stage at Katy Perry's Sydney concert in June this year. He did the same at a concert by The Chainsmokers last December.If found guilty, he may be fined up to S$2000 ($1540; £1170). Fans had earlier called for him to be arrested and deported. \"There needs to be action [taken] against him as this is clearly a criminal offence,\" wrote an Instagram user, in a comment a video Mr Wen posted of his act.  \"Oh wow so you do this a lot... how aren't you in jail?\" one Instagram user wrote. Several accused Mr Wen of \"re-traumatising\" Grande, who has spoken of experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder after a suicide bomb attack at the end of her May 2017 concert in Manchester, killing 22 people and injuring hundreds.\"Ariana has been through so many scary things... and at her Manchester concert and you thought it would be fun to jump the barricade?\" said another comment on Instagram. Some fans also criticised security officers at the Thursday event for not being vigilant enough; while others called for social media platforms to ban Mr Wen's videos.In clips circulating online, Grande appeared shocked when she was grabbed by the intruder. Her co-stars Michelle Yeoh and Erivo can be seen comforting her while Mr Wen was escorted away by security.Grande has not commented on the incident, and the rest of the event proceeded as planned.The BBC has reached out to Singapore's police and immigration authority for comment.Hundreds of fans had gathered in a sea of green and pink at the Wicked: For Good Asia-Pacific premiere in a Singapore mall, including some who had stood in line for as long as eight hours before it began.The movie, to be released on 21 November, is the second of a two-part adaptation of the popular Broadway and West End musical Wicked, which centres on the unlikely friendship between two very different witches.The musical itself is a spin-off of the 1900 children's novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.Grande, who plays the good witch Glinda, was decked out in a champagne pink sequin dress at the premiere while Erivo, who plays the wicked witch, wore a black tube grown embroidered with roses.They were joined by co-star Jeff Goldblum who plays the wizard.The first movie, Wicked, was the highest-grossing movie of 2024 in the UK, and scored 10 Oscar nominations, winning two for best costume and production design.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump has withdrawn all support for Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a firebrand conservative who long supported Trump's agenda but recently criticised several of his policies.Trump said in a nearly 300-word social media post that the Georgia lawmaker had gone \"far left\", and called for her to be unseated in next year's midterm election by a Republican challenger. The falling out comes after Greene questioned whether Trump was still putting \"America First\" on his agenda. She criticised his focus on foreign policy and handling of Jeffrey Epstein files.Greene said Trump was lashing out to try and deter other Republicans from voting to release the files.\"All I see \"Wacky\" Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!\" Trump posted, while en route to his home in Florida on Friday night.He claimed that she turned on him after he suggested that she shouldn't run for governor or senator. \"She has told many people that she is upset that I don't return her phone calls anymore,\" Trump said, adding, \"I can't take a ranting Lunatic's call every day.\"Trump also said that voters in her district \"are fed up with her and her antics and, if the right person runs, they will have my Complete and Unyielding Support\".Trump has long faced criticised from both parties over his handling of the US Department of Justice's files related to Epstein, the late financier and convicted paedophile. Trump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.Greene is one of four House Republicans - including Nancy Mace, Lauren Boebert, and Thomas Massie - who joined Democrats in signing a discharge petition calling for the release of the Epstein files.In response to Trump, Greene posted on X that Trump was trying to stop other Republicans from voting in favour of the Epstein petition.\"He's coming after me hard to make an example to scare all the other Republicans before next weeks vote to release the Epstein files,\" she posted, adding: \"It's astonishing really how hard he's fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level.\"Greene has in recent days been attacking Trump for not doing enough to bring down costs for voters, and for his involvement in foreign conflicts, and tariff policies.But she has also fiercely criticised his approach to handing the Epstein files. \"I truly just stand with the women, and I think they deserve to be the ones that we're fighting for,\" she told the BBC's US partner, CBS News, earlier on Friday.",

    "body": "A young French campaigner, who set up an association to help victims of drugs violence and took their cause to President Emmanuel Macron, has lost a second brother to suspected criminal gangs in Marseille.Amine Kessaci's 20-year-old brother Mehdi was parking his car in the centre of the city, when a motorcycle drew up and the pillion passenger opened fire with a 9mm pistol.Their elder brother, Brahim, was murdered in 2020. He was shot and his charred body found in a burned-out car, a common method in gang killings known locally as a \"barbecue\".Marseille is renowned for worsening drugs wars, with rival gangs from high-immigration neighbourhoods in the north of the city battling over turf. While Amine's murdered elder brother, Brahim, was known to have become involved with drugs gangs, investigators say that was not true of Mehdi, who had ambitions to become a policeman. They fear the murder was a warning aimed at Amine.\"That hypothesis is absolutely not being ruled out,\" said Marseille chief prosecutor Nicolas Bessone on French radio.\"And if it turns out to be the case, it will mean we have crossed another threshold.  It brings back certain terrible periods in our country's history, when you went out and killed people simply because they were from a family with whom you had problems.\"After his elder brother's murder, Amine set up an association called Conscience, which aims to help young people in Marseille's poor estates to escape the clutches of powerful drugs gangs.He was a high-school student at the time, and then last year ran unsuccessfully for the Green Party in European and legislative elections. He recently wrote a book called Marseille Wipe your Tears – Life and Death in a Land of Drugs and now, aged 22, he lives under police protection after receiving death threats.\"It's just so sad for my friend and for his mother,\" said Christine Juste, a Green Party city councillor in Marseille.\"No mother should go through that — losing two children. And I'm so angry that in France's second city,  people can be murdered so easily in plain daylight.\"Vendettas spawn successions of revenge murders, with killers sometimes as young as 15. So far there have been 14 drugs-related murders this year.Amine Kessaci's association, Conscience, has branches in several other towns and cities. Its main activities involve providing help and advice to families who have lost sons in drugs violence, and creating links between ex-delinquents and employers.When he was 17, Amine was selected to meet Emmanuel Macron when the president came to Marseille in 2021 to discuss projects to improve life in the city.  A local newspaper dubbed him in its headline: \"The kid from the estates who has Macron's ear.\"Explaining his decision to run for election the young campaigner wrote in his book: \"Politics never held out its hand to me, so I decided to grab it by the throat. Brahim – it was you who threw me into politics the day you burned in a car.\"",

    "body": "15 hours agoIone WellsSouth America CorrespondentAFP via Getty ImagesTens of millions of cubic metres of toxic waste and mud were unleashed through communities surrounding the damMining company BHP has been found liable for a 2015 dam collapse in Brazil, known as the country's worst-ever environmental disaster, by London's High Court.The dam collapse killed 19 people, polluted the river and destroyed hundreds of homes.The civil lawsuit, representing more than 600,000 people including civilians, local governments and businesses, had been valued at up to £36bn ($48bn).BHP said it would appeal against the ruling and continue to fight the lawsuit and has said many claimants in the London lawsuit had already been paid compensation in Brazil.The dam in Mariana, southeastern Brazil, was owned by Samarco, a joint venture between the mining giants Vale and BHP.The claimants' lawyers argued successfully that the trial should be held in London because BHP headquarters \"were in the UK at the time of the dam collapse\".A separate claim against Samarco's second parent company, Brazilian mining company Vale, was filed in the Netherlands, with more than 70,000 plaintiffs.The dam was used to store waste from iron ore mining. When it burst, it unleashed tens of millions of cubic metres of toxic waste and mud. The sludge swept through communities, destroying hundreds of people's homes and poisoning the river.Judge Finola O'Farrell said in her High Court ruling that continuing to raise the height of the dam when it was not safe to do so was the \"direct and immediate cause\" of the dam's collapse, meaning BHP was liable under Brazilian law.BHP is expected to appeal the ruling. President of BHP's Minerals Americas, Brandon Craig, said in a statement that 240,000 claimants in the London lawsuit \"have already been paid compensation in Brazil\".\"We believe this will significantly reduce the size and value of claims in the UK group action,\" he added.The lawsuit has been littered with different clashes between the UK firm representing the claimants, Pogust Goodhead, and BHP. BHP always denied liability and said the London lawsuit duplicated legal proceedings and reparation and repair programmes in Brazil.BHP and Vale have set up an organisation called the Renova Foundation tasked with compensating victims. It has offered them either cash compensation, or a house in a new city that the foundation has built to replace the town of Novo Bento and has disbursed billions of dollars in repair and compensation actions to hundreds of thousands of people.In June, a presentation by BHP and Vale's Samarco venture said around 130,000 people in Brazil had reached settlements with them. In response, Pogust Goodhead alleged the companies had pressured claimants to \"settle their claims at far below their true value\" and that it would seek £1.3bn in unpaid fees lost as a result.It alleged that a $30.3bn compensation agreement which Brazil signed with BHP, Vale and Samarco in October 2024 prevented claimants from discussing the deal with the firm or paying its legal fees.The firm said it had incurred $1bn in borrowing costs to finance the English case.BHP said it rejected Pogust Goodhead's allegations in their entirety and dispute \"their factual and legal basis.\"It said the claims were \"without merit\" and BHP would \"vigorously contest them.\" A spokesperson also said that the firm continued to believe Brazil was the most appropriate, effective, and efficient place for compensation for the dam collapse.AFP via Getty ImagesSome of those affected by the disaster travelled to the High Court last yearBut there were also parallel claims that Pogust Goodhead – which promotes itself as a firm representing human rights and environmental law – had tried to profit off \"vulnerable\" Brazilians.During proceedings the firm was accused of \"misleading\" vulnerable Brazilians for its own gain by a Brazilian judge in the state of Minas Gerais.Pogust Goodhead rejected the accusation at the time as \"without merit\". In a claim brought by the Public Prosecutors and Public Defenders in Brazil against Pogust Goodhead, the judge criticised several \"allegedly abusive clauses\" in Pogust Goodhead's contracts with Brazilians who suffered damage.Among these, it alleges the law firm engaged in \"misleading advertising\" considering the \"hypervulnerability of those affected\".It also alleges \"undue charging of fees on compensation amounts obtained extrajudicially in Brazil\" which it said represents \"illicit enrichment that diverts essential resources from those affected\" and \"excessive\" penalties for claimants who terminated their contracts which it said \"discouraged\" them from joining national compensation programmes.The former Brazilian ambassador in London and Washington, Rubens Barbosa, told the BBC earlier this year that he believed this amounted to spreading misleading information in Brazil.Mr Barbosa said bringing the case to London \"hinders efforts to resolve the matter locally\" and the \"extremely vulnerable Brazilians were misled\" by contracts.",

    "body": "10 hours agoWill DahlgreenBBC News InvestigationsReutersBannon was one of Trump's closest advisers before he resigned from the White House in August 2017In November 2018, Steve Bannon, formerly Donald Trump's chief strategist, was in the UK preparing for a speech at the Oxford Union. The event was interrupted by hundreds of protesters and Bannon, who was due to board a flight that night, told Jeffrey Epstein in an email: \"Protesters slowed down speech don't think I can make the flight we r enroute to heathrow\".Epstein replied: \"There. Is a gulf air that leaves at 950 with a stop in Bahrain\". Bannon replied: \"U r an amazing assistant\".The messages were published on Wednesday alongside more than 20,000 pages of documents from the estate of Epstein, the late convicted sex offender and disgraced financier.The release by the House oversight committee in Congress includes an iMessage chat in which Bannon's name is redacted. The BBC has been able to establish his identity by matching the dates, events and places mentioned.For example, Epstein discusses chartering a plane from Scotland for the redacted user in the chat, and offers praise for their \"Oxford speech\". Bannon took part in the News Xchange conference in Edinburgh on 14 November, and gave the speech at the Oxford Union two days later.Bannon, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, did not reply to the BBC's request for comment.'I'll make sure you're well looked after'Bannon was one of Trump's closest advisers in the run up to the 2016 election and in the early days of his first administration, but resigned from the White House in August 2017.He has acknowledged he was making a film about Epstein prior to his death and reportedly has around 15 hours of footage. In a live taping of his podcast earlier this year, he said: \"We're going to release the film, the five-part series, next year - early next year.\"But the newly released documents suggest Bannon's relationship with Epstein went further than being his biographer, with the convicted paedophile occasionally seeming to act like a personal assistant.A few days before the exchange in which Epstein appeared to have arranged a charter jet for Bannon, Epstein said: \"how does it feel to have the most highly paid travel agent in history \". Bannon thanked him: \"U r pretty good asst\", to which Epstein replied \"Massages. Not Included\".Discussing a trip to \"AD\" in another message - presumably meaning Abu Dhabi - Epstein told Bannon: \"I'll make sure you're well looked after.\"The released messages also show Bannon and Epstein discussing UK politics in 2018.Earlier on the same day he spoke at the Oxford Union, Bannon texted Epstein: \"I've gotten pulled into the Brexit thing this morning with Nigel, Boris and Rees Mogg.\"Then, in what appears to be a reference to Theresa May, the embattled UK prime minister at the time, he added: \"The guys are trying to move on. may today / tomorrow…\"Epstein advised Bannon: \"I think staying as long as you can uk . Best- so people get the commitment of your follow through.\"Shortly after Epstein asked: \"Will Theresa may survive\". Bannon replied: \"I don't see how BUT the guys over here have no balls\" and added \"Boris ; Gove; Rees Mogg; David Davis - somebody has to step up\".Theresa May was eventually toppled in May 2019 after surviving two votes of no confidence in December 2018.A spokesman for Reform UK told the BBC: \"Nigel Farage has never been in a meeting with Steve Bannon, Jacob Rees Mogg and Boris Johnson.\" And there is no evidence such a meeting took place.The US House of Representatives will vote next week on whether the justice department should release all its files related to its investigation into Epstein, who died in prison in 2019.Interest in Epstein's relationships with powerful figures was renewed this week after the release of more than 20,000 pages of documents from his estate. Some of those mentioned Trump, who has consistently denied any wrongdoing. The president was a friend of Epstein's for years, but says they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested.With additional reporting from Josh CheethamWatch: How much do Americans care about the Epstein story?",

    "body": "8 hours agoRobin Levinson-King and Eloise AlannaSubmitted photoThe first thing Lana Ponting remembers about the Allan Memorial Institute, a former psychiatric hospital in Montreal, Canada, is the smell - almost medicinal. \"I didn't like the look of the place. It didn't look like a hospital to me,\" she told the BBC from her home in Manitoba.That hospital – once the home of a Scottish shipping magnate – would be her home for a month in April 1958, after a judge ordered the then-16-year-old to undergo treatment for \"disobedient\" behaviour.It was there that Ms Ponting became one of thousands of people experimented on as part of the CIA's top-secret research into mind control. Now, she is one of two named plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit for Canadian victims of the experiments. On Thursday, a judge denied the Royal Victoria Hospital's appeal, paving the way for the lawsuit to proceed.According to her medical files, which she obtained only recently, Ms Ponting had been running away from home and hanging out with friends her parents disapproved of after a difficult move with her family from Ottawa to Montreal.\"I was an ordinary teenager,\" she recalled. But the judge sent her to the Allan. Once there, she became an unwitting participant in covert CIA experiments known as MK-Ultra. The Cold War project tested the effects of psychedelic drugs like LSD, electroshock treatments and brainwashing techniques on human beings without their consent. Over 100 institutions – hospitals, prisons and schools – in the US and Canada were involved.At the Allan, McGill University researcher Dr Ewen Cameron drugged patients and made them listen to recordings, sometimes thousands of times, in a process he called \"exploring\".The Allan Memorial Institute in Montreal is where the CIA-backed experiments were conducted in CanadaDr Cameron would make Ms Ponting listen to the same tape recording hundreds of times.\"It ran over and over again, you're a good girl, you're a bad girl,\" Ms Ponting recalled.The technique was a form of \"psychic driving,\" says doctoral student Jordan Torbay, who has researched his experiments and their ethical implications.\"Essentially the minds of patients were manipulated using verbal cues,\" she says, adding he also looked at the effects of sleep drugs, forced sensory deprivation, and induced coma.Medical records show Ms Ponting was given LSD, as well as drugs like sodium amytal, a barbiturate, desoxyn, a stimulant, as well as nitrous gas, a sedative known as \"laughing gas\".\"By April 30th, the patient had explorations… she had become quite tense and extremely violent when given the Nitrous Oxide, throwing herself half out of bed and starting to scream,\" Dr Cameron wrote in one of her medical files, which Ms Ponting has obtained through a freedom of information request.The harsh truth about the MK-Ultra experiments first came to light in the 1970s. Since then, several victims have tried to sue the US and Canada. Lawsuits in the US have largely been unsuccessful, but in 1988, a Canadian judge ordered the US government to pay nine victims $67,000 each. In 1992 the Canadian government paid C$100,000 (about $80,000 at the time) to each of 77 victims – but did not admit liability.Ms Ponting was not among them, because she did not yet know that she was a victim, she saysWatch: The CIA's secret pursuit of 'mind control'Listen: The Woman Who Resisted Mind ControlFor decades, Ms Ponting said she felt something was wrong with her, but she did not learn of the details of her own involvement in the experiments until somewhat recently.She says she had little memory of what happened at the Allan, or in the years that followed. Ms Ponting eventually married and moved to Manitoba, where she had two children whom she is still close to. Now, she's a grandmother to four grandchildren. But she says she has suffered life-long repercussions from her time at the Allan. \"I felt it all my life, because I was wondering why I would think this way, or, you know what happened to me,\" she said.She says she's had to be on a cocktail of medications her whole life to deal with mental-health issues, which she attributes to her time at the Allan, as well as recurrent nightmares. \"Sometimes I wake up screaming in the night because of what happened,\" she said.The Royal Victoria Hospital and McGill University declined to comment as the case is before the courts. The government pointed the BBC to its previous settlement, in 1992, which it said was done for \"humanitarian\" reasons and did not accept legal liability. For Ms Pointing, the lawsuit is a chance to finally get some closure.\"Sometimes I sit in my living room and my mind goes back, and I can think of the things that happened to me, you know,\" she says. \"Every time I see a picture of Dr Cameron, it makes me so angry.\"Although Dr Cameron's work has since become synonymous with MK-Ultra experiments, Ms Torbay says her research shows he didn't know he was being funded by the CIA at the time. His work with the US intelligence agency ended in 1964, and he died shortly after, of a heart attack, in 1967.But regardless of whether he knew of where the money was coming from, Ms Torbay says he should have known the experiments he was conducting were not ethical.She says she hopes the lawsuit goes forward, and the victims get some sense of justice. \"It isn't really about giving the patients back what they lost, because that's not possible, but sort of almost making sure their suffering wasn't in vain, that we do learn from this,\" she says.",

    "body": "15 hours agoHumphrey Mgonja,Dar es Salaam and Wycliffe MuiaTanzania's President Samia Suluhu Hassan has announced an official investigation the unrest that broke out during election week, following accusations that her government was responsible for violently crushing historic protests.She was declared the winner of last month's presidential poll with 98% of the vote - a result the opposition has denounced as a \"mockery of democracy.\" At least 240 people were charged with treason after the protests.As well as the commission of inquiry, President Samia has also asked prosecutors to \"show leniency\" towards those arrested in connection with the violence. Quoting the Bible, she said: \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\"Her remarks come just days after the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, urged Tanzanian authorities to conduct a full and transparent investigation into reports of killings and other serious human rights violations during and after the 29 October elections.Hundreds may have died in post-election unrest, according to the opposition. The authorities are yet to release an official death toll.The violence was shocking for a nation that had cultivated an image of calm, consensus and order for nearly six decades.During an address to parliament on Friday, President Samia urged prosecutors to consider reducing or dropping charges for individuals who may have been swept up in the unrest without fully understanding their actions.\"I am aware that many young people have been arrested and charged with treason. They did not fully understand what they were getting involved in,\" she said. \"As a mother and guardian of this nation, I am directing law-enforcement agencies, especially the DPP's office, to show leniency.\"Samia also called on political parties to meet and discuss how to conduct politics without causing harm to the country. She reaffirmed her commitment to initiating a new constitution-making process.The protests, organised by young people, drew clear parallels with global Gen Z-led mobilisations against entrenched leadership and unresponsive governments.Analysts say while the unrest was unprecedented for Tanzania, it was preceded by a tense political climate - marked by stalled reforms, years of simmering youth anger, power tussles within the ruling party and the sustained persecution of opposition leaders.In the months preceding election day, the CCM government worked to systematically eliminate any credible competition, according to analysts.The two main opposition leaders were blocked from standing in last month's poll - Tundu Lissu is in detention on treason charges, which he denies, while Luhaga Mpina's candidacy was rejected on technical grounds.During her first term in office, Samia's approach to leadership had been initially admired both at home and abroad as she allowed opposition parties to organise rallies and criticise the government without the fear of grave repercussions.She had pledged to re-open Tanzania to the world through her \"4R\" doctrine - reconciliation, resilience, rebuilding and reform.But months to the election, a wave of abductions, arrests and the brutal killings of opposition members gripped the country, shattering hopes for reforms and reconciliation.Additional reporting by Natasha Booty",

    "body": "The US justice department has confirmed it will investigate paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein's alleged links to major banks and several prominent Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton.US President Donald Trump said he would ask Attorney General Pam Bondi and the FBI to look into Epstein's \"involvement and relationship\" with Clinton and others.Bondi said the department \"will pursue this with urgency and integrity\".Trump's request came days after thousands of Epstein's emails were released by the US Congress - which include mentions of the US president. Democrats have accused Trump of trying to deflect from questions about his relationship with Epstein.The emails, released by the US House Oversight Committee, include many high-profile figures. A review by the Wall Street Journal found that Trump was mentioned in more than 1,600 or the 2,324 email threads. Robert Garcia, the leading Democrat on the committee, said Trump was attempting to \"deflect from serious new questions we have about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein\".In addition to Clinton, Trump said he asked the Department of Justice (DoJ) to investigate banks JP Morgan and Chase, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, who is also a prominent Democratic donor.\"Epstein was a Democrat, and he is the Democrat's problem, not the Republican's problem!\" he wrote on social media. \"They all know about him, don't waste your time with Trump. I have a Country to run!\"Clinton has strongly denied he had any knowledge of Epstein's crimes.A spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase said the firm regrets \"any association\" they had with Epstein, and added that the firm \"did not help him commit his heinous acts\".It is unclear whether Trump made a formal request or issued a directive to the justice department, or if Bondi was responding to his post on his Truth Social platform.Bondi said she appointed US Attorney Jay Clayton to lead an investigation into the ties with Epstein. Trump's request comes ahead of the House of Representatives' vote next week on whether the justice department should release all its files related to the investigation into Epstein, who died in prison in 2019.Democrat Adelita Grijalva's swearing in to the chamber on Wednesday triggered the move, after she immediately signed a discharge petition from calling for the release of the files.Her signature was the 218th - the final signing needed to trigger a floor vote. Four Republicans joined with Democrats to call for the vote.Interest in Epstein's relationships was renewed this week after US lawmakers released more than 20,000 pages of documents from his estate, including many mentioning Trump.Documents released by the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday appeared to show correspondence between Epstein and the former US Treasury Secretary, Larry Summers from October 2017.In one email, Summers gives Epstein his opinion of Trump early in his presidency, writing: \"DJT is world s luckiest guy in terms of opposition, economy etc. still think his world will collapse\".A representative for Summers told the Wall Street Journal in 2023 that the former treasury official and past president of Harvard University \"deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein after his conviction\".The documents also included email exchanges between Epstein and his long-time associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.In one email, sent in 2011, Epstein writes to Maxwell: \"I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump.. [VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him.\"Trump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. While he was discussed in some of the messages released this week, he did not send or receive them.Traditionally, presidents do not direct the justice department to investigate individuals and companies and have often brought in special counsels - independent attorneys from outside the administration - to carry out investigations. It is also rare for an administration to seek an investigation of a predecessor. However, the Biden administration started investigations tied to allegations that Trump tried to interfere with the 2020 election, which were then referred to a special counsel. The cases were dropped when Trump returned to the White House. In a letter addressed to Congress, Epstein survivors and the family of Virginia Giuffre - a prominent accuser of his - called for US lawmakers to vote in favour of releasing the files. \"As you gather with your family this season, remember that your primary duty is to your constituents. Look into the eyes of your children, your sisters, your mothers, and your aunts,\" the letter reads.\"Imagine if they had been preyed upon. Imagine if you yourself were a survivor. What would you want for them? What would you want for yourself? When you vote, we will remember your decision at the ballot box.\"On Friday, Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene said it would be \"huge miscalculation\" for Trump to oppose the release of material related to Epstein. Greene was among the four other House Republicans - Nancy Mace, Lauren Boebert, Thomas Massie - who joined Democrats in signing a discharge petition calling for the release of the files.\"I truly just stand with the women, and I think they deserve to be the ones that we're fighting for,\" she told the BBC's US partner, CBS News.On Friday night, Trump announced that he had withdrawn his support for Greene, calling his formerly close ally \"wacky\" and \"a ranting lunatic\", and offering to back her Republican challenger in next year's midterm elections.\"That's too bad she's lost a wonderful conservative reputation,\" he told reporters.",

    "body": "Pakistan's army has always been influential - now its chief has new powers8 hours agoCaroline DaviesPakistan correspondent, IslamabadEPAField Marshal Munir, who has been army chief since November 2022, will now also oversee the navy and air forcePakistan's parliament has voted to give army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir new powers and lifetime immunity from arrest and prosecution, a move that critics say paves the way towards autocracy.The 27th constitutional amendment, which was signed into law on Thursday, will also make significant changes to the way the country's top courts operate.Those defending the changes say they provide clarity and administrative structure to the armed forces, while helping to ease a backlog in the courts. Pakistan's military has long played a prominent role in the nuclear-armed country's politics - sometimes seizing power in coups, and, on other occasions, pulling levers behind the scenes.Throughout its history, Pakistan has oscillated from more civilian autonomy to overt control under military leaders like General Pervez Musharraf and General Zia-ul-Haq. Analysts refer to the balance between civilian and military as hybrid rule.Some see the amendment as a sign that the balance is shifting in the military's favour.\"For me, this amendment is the latest indication, perhaps the strongest yet, that Pakistan is now experiencing not a hybrid system, but a post-hybrid system,\" says Michael Kugelman, director of the Wilson Center's South Asia Institute in Washington. \"We're essentially looking at a situation where the civil-military imbalance is about as imbalanced as it could possibly be.\"The latest amendment means that Munir, who has been army chief since November 2022, will now also oversee Pakistan's navy and air force.His field marshal title and uniform are for life and he will be given \"responsibilities and duties\" even after retirement determined by the president with the advice of the prime minister. The expectation is that this will give him a prominent role in public life for as long as he is alive.Supporters of the bill have argued it clarifies Pakistan's military command structure.Pakistan's government-operated news agency, the Associated Press of Pakistan, cited Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as saying that the changes were part of a broader reform agenda to ensure Pakistan's defence keeps pace with modern warfare requirements.But others see it as ceding power to the military.\"There is no balance between the military and the civilians,\" says Munizae Jahangir, journalist and co-chair of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.\"They have tilted again that power dynamic towards the military and empowered the military at a time when the military needed to be reined in.\"Getty ImagesPakistan's military has long played a prominent role in the nuclear-armed country's politicsNo 'independent space to operate'The second controversial area of change are the courts and judiciary.Under the amendment a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) will be created which will determine constitutional questions. The FCC's first chief justice and the judges that serve in it will be appointed by the president. \"It forever changes the shape and the nature of the right to a fair trial,\" says Ms Jahangir.\"The influence of the executive has increased not just in appointing judges but also constitutional benches. When the state is dictating the constitution of those benches then what hope do I have as a litigant of getting a fair trial?\"Arifa Noor, journalist and commentator, says: \"The judiciary is now quite subservient to the executive.\"The general consensus seems to be that the judiciary is now going to not really have any independent space to operate for the moment.\"Before this amendment was passed, the Supreme Court would hear and decide on constitutional cases. Some said this created a backlog of criminal and civil cases waiting to be heard as judges had to listen to constitutional arguments as well,  arguing that separating the two has helped smooth the court process.That has some traction with some lawyers, although Salahuddin Ahmed, a Karachi-based lawyer in the Supreme Court, sees that argument as disingenuous. He points out that the majority of cases pending in Pakistan are not in the Supreme Court.\"Statistically, if you were genuinely worried about making litigation quicker, you would focus on reforms for those cases.\"In the hours after the amendment was signed into law, two Supreme Court justices handed in their resignations.\"The constitution that I swore an oath to uphold and defend is no more,\" said Justice Athar Minallah in his resignation letter.Justice Mansoor Ali Shah said that the judiciary had been brought under the control of the government and that the 27th amendment had \"torn the Supreme Court to pieces\".Khawaja Asif, the defence minister, said of the resignations \"their conscience has awakened because their monopoly on the Supreme Court has been curbed and Parliament has tried to prove the supremacy of the Constitution\".Judges can also now be transferred to different courts without their consent. If they don't agree to the transfer, judges can appeal to the judicial commission and if their reasons for not moving are found invalid the judge would have to retire. Those in favour argue that this will ensure that courts in all areas of the country can be staffed, but some are worried it will be used as a threat.\"To pick a judge up from the province where he's been serving and take him to a different high court is something that will place them under further pressure to toe the government's line,\" says Mr Ahmed. He worries that the change will upset the balance in Pakistan.\"[Our judiciary] has collaborated with dictators in the past, but they've also sometimes nudged the executive. I think if you completely rob people of that hope, then that sends them into other, much uglier directions.\"Mr Kugelman agrees: \"Bottled-up grievances don't bode well for social stability.\"\"It does indicate a slide towards authoritarianism,\" says Ms Noor, adding that she sees the latest amendment as building on the 26th amendment, made last year, which gave lawmakers the power to pick Pakistan's top judge. There is already speculation of a 28th. \"It indicates that the balance of power is tilted in favour, heavily tilted in favour, of the establishment.\"",

    "body": "1 day agoMadeline HalpertKristy GammonMs Gammon and her husband used to enjoy travelling to the US to go to Baltimore Orioles gamesKristy Gammon used to travel to the US from Canada at least once every other year, taking ski trips at Lake Placid in New York and travelling to Baltimore, Maryland, for her husband's favourite Orioles baseball games.But those trips are now over, she said. This year, the Nova Scotia resident has avoided even passing through the US on her way to Ontario, a shortcut for an otherwise 18-hour drive.Since President Donald Trump took office earlier this year, the 62-year-old said she and most of her Canadian friends have decided to stop visiting the US as a way of protesting policies they oppose and trade actions Trump has taken against Canada.\"There are so many things that we just feel aghast about in terms of how [the administration] is acting internationally, behaving toward their own citizens, how they're treating their allies and neighbours, i.e. Canada,\" Ms Gammon said.Ms Gammon and her friends are part of a trend that shows no signs of slowing. October marked the 10th straight month of decline in the number of Canadian travellers to the US. Air travel from Canada to the US dropped nearly 24%, while car travel fell more than 30% when compared to the same period last year, according to data released this week by Canada's statistics office.Overall, the US has seen a 3.2% drop in international spending in the country, driven primarily by fewer visitors from Canada, according to the US Travel Association, a nonprofit group representing the American travel industry.As relations between the two countries remain icy, mostly in response to new tariffs Trump has imposed, Canadians are apparently committed to giving their southern neighbours the cold shoulder.In the past, Canadians have made up about a quarter of all international visitors to the US, spending over $20bn (£15.1bn) a year, according to the US Travel Association.They began to curb their US travel after Trump imposed a series of tariffs on goods from the country earlier this year, saying he wanted to reduce the trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods the US buys from Canada and those it sells to them. Trump also said Canada should do more to reduce the flow of illegal drug fentanyl into the US.Canada is currently facing 35% tariffs on its goods - although most are exempt under an existing North American free trade agreement - as well as individual levies targeting particular industries like car and steel manufacturing.Trade talks between the two countries were derailed last month when Trump was angered by an anti-tariff advertisement in the US that featured Ronald Reagan and was sponsored by the province of Ontario.Meanwhile, he has angered Canadians with his many public comments about making their country the \"51st state\".Some popular tourist destinations in US have tried to buck the trend, attempting to entice Canadian travellers back to the US. In Kalispell, Montana, home to Glacier National Park, officials have been offering a \"Canadian Welcome Pass\" that includes deals and discounts at local businesses for those crossing the border.\"For the last several months, our countries have been going through some things. But there's one thing we know and it's this – we miss you,\" the website for the welcome pass says.Major events scheduled to take place in the US in the coming years could help drive visitors from other places and replace the missing Canadian tourists, including the FIFA 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, according to the US Travel Association.'Come hug it out!' - How a Canadian tourism ad went viralStill, with Canadians choosing to travel closer to home, the country's own tourism industry has gotten a boost. Canada's tourism sector made a record-breaking C$59bn from May to August of 2025, up 6% from the same period last year, mostly because of people choosing to travel domestically, according to Destination Canada, a national tourism organisation.Some of those choosing to stay home are Canadian snowbirds, retirees who travel south to states like Florida to find warmth in the winter months. A survey from the Travel Health Insurance Association of Canada found these baby boomers were staying home more than other age groups, with only 10% planning US trips for this year, down 66% compared to last year.Ms Gammon said some of her friends have even chosen to sell their winter homes in Florida because of the frosty relations and frustrations with the Trump administration.\"They've completely changed their snowbird plans,\" the semi-retired family physician said. \"You can feel there's a shift.\"Ms Gammon said she did not know if others would stick to boycotting the US for the remaining three years of the Trump administration. But, even though she misses her US trips, that is her plan for now.\"Who knows what could change between now and three years,\" Ms Gammon said. \"But it would have to be pretty significant changes for us personally to change our minds.\"",

    "body": "13 hours agoToby Luckhurst,In Kyiv and Ottilie Mitchell'Astonishingly lethal': James Landale reports from site of deadly Russian strikeA Russian drone has slammed into a block of flats in eastern Kyiv, killing six people and wounding dozens of others, during a wave of strikes throughout the Ukrainian capital.As emergency workers sifted through the wreckage in the Lisovyi area, one Kyiv resident called Vita described how the drone had pierced the building, exploding on the other side.Meanwhile, Ukraine stepped up its attacks on Russia's oil infrastructure, with drone strikes on one of its biggest export terminals in Novorossiysk, on the Black Sea coast.Fire broke out at the Sheskharis oil refinery, and a ship and a block of flats were hit, officials said.Krasnodar governor Veniamin Kondratyev said three crew members and another man were hurt in the attack which damaged the main oil depot and a container terminal.Mayor Andrei Kravchenko declared a state of emergency and Reuters reported that oil exports were suspended.President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine had fired long-range \"Long Neptune\" cruise missiles during its attacks on Russia overnight, without specifying what they targeted.ReutersKyiv fire service said the drone destroyed several floors of the entire block of flatsCondemning Russia's overnight attacks as vile and calculated, Zelensky said about 430 drones and 18 missiles had been launched and dozens of high-rise buildings damaged. \"This was a deliberately calculated attack aimed at causing maximum harm to people and civilian infrastructure,\" he said.A drone attack on a market at Chornomorsk in the south of the country killed two people.In Kyiv, residential buildings came under attack \"in practically every district\", the head of the city's military administration Tymur Tkachenko said on Telegram.He issued a warning to take shelter a minute after midnight local time on Thursday night, writing \"it's loud in Kyiv\".Watch: Kyiv air defences downing Russian drones and missiles during attackThe fire service in the Lisovyi neighbourhood said later the drone had hit the seventh floor of the residential building. When it exploded all the floors - from the eighth down to the fourth - collapsed, a spokesman told the BBC.Vita said she saw four bodies being pulled out of the apartment a few doors down from hers: \"I saw it with my own eyes.\"Two cranes hoisted emergency workers outside the block, as crews combed through the destroyed building, throwing broken sections of wall and shattered glass to the ground.Falling debris and fires damaged several high-rise apartment buildings, a hospital, school and administrative buildings, according to emergency services. Oleh Kiper/TelegramA drone killed at least two people at a market in Chornomorsk in southern UkraineMore than 40 people were rescued, they added, including 14 from a fire in a residential building. Another person was rescued after being pulled from beneath the rubble, they said.Kyiv's energy infrastructure was badly hit, leaving some buildings in the capital without heat, officials said. \"The attack was massive, with drones, with ballistic [missiles], with lots of air defence working,\" Ukrainian MP Lisa Yasko told the BBC. \"Very often there was the feeling that your bed was just shaking  together with the windows.\"Medical teams were deployed to all fires, officials said, while Mayor Vitali Klitschko said nine people were being treated in hospital with one man in an \"extremely serious condition\".ReutersWitnesses described how a Russian drone pierced the entire block of flats in Kyiv before explodingUkraine's air force warned drones and guided bombs had been targeting several other regions, including Sumy.The overnight strikes follow the deaths of six people in another Russian offensive less than a week ago that also damaged residential buildings and energy infrastructure. Russia says its attacks on energy targets - now a familiar part of the war - are aimed at the Ukrainian military, although Kyiv has long rejected that claim.",

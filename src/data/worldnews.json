    "body": "2 hours agoAndré Rhoden-Paul and Mallory MoenchandBBC VerifyWatch: How the US attack on Venezuela unfoldedThe US has captured Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro after a large-scale strike on the South American country, US President Donald Trump has said. Trump said Venezuela's left-wing president and his wife were flown out in a military operation carried out in conjunction with US law enforcement. They have been charged with drug and weapons offences in New York. It comes after explosions were reported across the capital Caracas in the early hours of Saturday morning, including at military bases. The Venezuelan government deployed its armed forces and declared a national emergency as Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez appeared poised to assume leadership of the country.Maduro's capture comes after heightened tensions between the two countries, with Washington striking boats in the Caribbean it says are being used to carry drugs. The US has accused the Venezuelan president of being personally involved in drug-smuggling and being an illegitimate leader, while Maduro has accused the US of intimidation and wanting to seize its oil.Trump during a news conference on Saturday said the US would \"run\" Venezuela \"until a safe and proper and judicious transition\", adding that American oil companies would also move into the country.Here is what we know so far. What do we know about the operation?Maduro was captured by the US army's Delta Force - the military's top counter terrorism unit, the BBC's US news partner CBS News reported.A CIA source inside the Venezuelan government helped the US track Maduro's location in the lead-up - part of an extensive intelligence network, CBS said.Speaking alongside Trump on Saturday, Gen Dan Caine, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Operation Absolute Resolve took months of planning and rehearsals, with forces waiting for the right weather.More than 150 aircraft were used to get an extraction team into the capital.The team came in and entered Maduro's compound - \"a house that was more like a fortress\", according to Trump - at 02:01 local time (06:01 GMT) - with the lights in Caracas having been turned off by the Americans.The US president said Maduro tried to get into a steel-fortified safe place, made it to the door, but was unable to close it.He added that no US forces were killed and there were \"few\" injuries in the operation, which he said he watched live.Maduro and his wife were put on a ship and then a plane, which later landed at Stewart Air National Guard Base in New York state, around 60 miles (97km) north of Manhattan.The pair were then transported to Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility in Brooklyn.Donald TrumpTrump posted a picture of Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima after his arrestAt the same time as the military operation, loud explosions were heard in Caracas, while plumes of smoke were seen rising over the city. Videos of explosions and helicopters flying overhead have been circulating on social media, but they have not been verified yet. It is not known if there have been any casualties. The Venezuelan government also said the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira were hit. Trump said US forces had been \"prepared for a second wave\" but did not have to conduct one because the first was \"so powerful\".AFP via Getty ImagesFuerte Tiuna, one of Venezuela's largest military bases was hit in CaracasWhere were the strikes?BBC Verify is working through a number of videos showing explosions, fire and smoke in locations around Caracas to identify exactly which sites were targeted. It has confirmed five locations, so far: Generalissimo Francisco de Miranda Air Base, an airfield known as La CarlotaFuerte Tiuna, a key military facility in CaracasPort La Guaira, Caracas' main conduit to the Caribbean Sea, located in Miranda stateHiguerote Airport, also located in Miranda state, just east of Caracas Antenas El Volcan, a telecomms towers on Cerro El Volcan, a high peak in Miranda stateHow has Venezuela reacted?Vice-President Rodríguez on state television appealed for calm and unity, called for the release of Maduro, who she said was the \"only president\", and added that Venezuela would never be a colony of any nation. Late Saturday, Venezuela's Supreme Court ruled that Rodríguez should assume the role of interim president, though it is not clear whether she has taken office.Earlier on Saturday, Trump said Rodríguez had been sworn in as president and had spoken to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and told him \"we'll do whatever you need\", Trump said. \"She really doesn't have a choice,\" Trump added.The country's defence minister Vladimir Padrino López earlier claimed the strikes hit civilian areas and said the government was compiling information about dead and injured people. He added that Venezuela would \"resist\" the presence of foreign troops.Venezuela's government issued an official statement denouncing the \"extremely serious military aggression\" by the US \"against Venezuelan territory and population in civilian and military locations\".It also accused the US of threatening international peace and stability and described the attack as an attempt to seize \"Venezuela's strategic resources, particularly its oil and minerals\" in an attempt to \"forcibly break the political independence of the nation\".What will happen to Venezuela next? During Saturday's news conference, Trump said the US was going \"to run the country until such time as we can do a safe and proper and judicious transition\".Asked by reporters about Venezuela's opposition leader and 2025 Nobel Peace winner María Corina Machado, Trump said she did not have support or respect.Earlier on social media, Machado had said \"the hour of freedom has arrived\" and called for Edmundo González Urrutia, who according to vote tallies released by her party won the 2024 election, to assume power.Trump also said American oil companies would move in to fix infrastructure \"and start making money for the country\". He said \"we're going to be taking a tremendous amount of wealth from the ground\" which would go to people in Venezuela and to the US, adding \"we're going to get reimbursed for everything we've spent\". He also said the US would sell oil to other countries.Asked whether US troops would be deployed to Venezuela, Trump said \"we're not afraid of boots on the ground\".What has Maduro been charged with? US attorney General Pam Bondi said Maduro and his wife, First Lady Cilia Flores, had been indicted in the Southern District of New York. They have been charged with conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism and import cocaine, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices against the US. \"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" Bondi wrote on X.Who is Maduro and why has he been captured? Nicolás Maduro rose to prominence under the leadership of left-wing President Hugo Chávez and his United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV). He succeeded Chávez as president in 2013. In 2024, Maduro was declared winner of the presidential election, even though voting tallies collected by the opposition suggested that its candidate, Edmundo González, had won by a landslide.He has been at odds with Trump over the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants in the US and the movement of drugs into the US, in particular fentanyl and cocaine.Trump has designated two Venezuelan drug gangs - Tren de Aragua and Cartel de los Soles - as Foreign Terrorist Organisations (FTOs) and has alleged that the latter was led by Maduro himself.The US had offered a $50m (£37m) reward for information leading to Maduro's arrest.Maduro has vehemently denied being a cartel leader and has accused the US of using its \"war on drugs\" as an excuse to try to depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's vast oil reserves.In recent months, US forces have also carried out more than two dozen strikes in international waters on boats it alleges have been used to traffick drugs into the US. More than 100 people have been killed.ReutersVenezuela's President Nicolás Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores have been capturedWho is Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores?First Lady Cilia Flores - who was also taken to the US and indicted alongside her husband - has held a number of senior posts in Venezuela, including attorney general and president of the national assembly. She is seen as a powerful political operator in her own right.Flores, 59, is colloquially known as Maduro's primera combatiente (first warrior), and has often been pictured at his side during public engagements.Like her husband, she was living under US sanctions - which were imposed during Trump's first presidency on the allegation that she was involved in Maduro's corrupt practices. At the time, Maduro hit back by saying: \"You don't mess with Cilia. You don't mess with family.\"Flores is a lawyer by training, and she once fought for the release from prison of Hugo Chávez, who tried to seize control of the Venezuelan government in 1992 and later went on to become the country's president. Her career became forever linked with Chávez's movement.Flores's tenure as head of the National Assembly was not without controversy, including her decision to prohibit press access to the parliamentary chamber, and accusations of nepotism.Flores's relatives have previously been targeted by the Americans on similar accusations of drugs trafficking. In 2015, two of her nephews were arrested in Haiti and convicted and imprisoned in the US on drugs charges. They were later released under a 2022 prisoner swap.How have other countries reacted?The initial news of the strikes prompted the strongest reaction from Venezuela's long-term allies.Russia accused the US of committing \"an act of armed aggression\" that was \"deeply concerning and condemnable\".China's foreign ministry said in a statement that it was \"deeply shocked and strongly condemns\" the use of force against a sovereign country and its president.Iran's foreign ministry called the strikes a \"flagrant violation of the country's national sovereignty\". Venezuela's neighbours Colombia and Brazil criticised the moves. Colombian President Gustavo Petro called the strikes an \"assault on the sovereignty\" of Latin America, while Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel described it as a \"criminal attack\". Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva wrote on X that the bombings and Maduro's capture \"cross an unacceptable line\", adding \"attacking countries in flagrant violation of international law is the first step toward a world of violence, chaos, and instability\".Chile's President Gabriel Boric expressed \"concern and condemnation\" on X and called for \"a peaceful solution to the serious crisis affecting the country\".Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Cane accused the US of a \"criminal attack\".Meanwhile, Trump's ally in Argentina, Javier Milei, wrote \"Freedom moves forward\" and \"Long live freedom\" on social media.On the international stage, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is \"deeply alarmed\" by the strikes, with his spokesman saying in a statement it sets a \"dangerous precedent\".The UN chief is \"deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected\" and calls on all actors in Venezuela to engage in inclusive dialogue, in full respect of human rights and the rule of law\", his spokesman said.UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his government would \"shed no tears\" about the end of Maduro's regime and would discuss the \"evolving situation\" in Venezuela with US counterparts.The EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas reiterated the bloc's position that Maduro lacks legitimacy and that there should be a peaceful transition of power, but said the principles of international law must be respected.French President Emmanuel Macron said the transition of power \"must be peaceful, democratic, and respectful of the will of the Venezuelan people\" in a post on X. He added he hoped González - the opposition's 2024 presidential candidate - could ensure the transition.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the legality of the US operation was \"complex\" and international law in general must apply. He warned that \"political instability must not be allowed to arise in Venezuela\".The office of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the government believed \"external military action is not the way to end totalitarian regimes\" but said it considered \"defensive intervention\" against hybrid attacks to be \"legitimate, as in the case of state entities that fuel and promote drug trafficking\".",

    "body": "7 hours agoTom McArthurandNick JohnsonGetty ImagesThe managers of a bar where a fire killed 40 people and injured another 119 have been placed under criminal investigation, Swiss prosecutors have said. The French couple - named by the media as Jacques and Jessica Moretti - are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office in Valais said. Eight Swiss nationals from among those killed were the first to be identified on Saturday. The likely cause of the fire at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana was sparklers on bottles being carried too close to the ceiling, a preliminary investigation found. In a statement, Beatrice Pilloud, the lead prosecutor in the canton of Valais, said investigators were looking into whether the venue's acoustic foam was \"the cause of the problem\", as well as \"whether it complies with regulations\".Among the dead and missing are many teenagers. Le Constellation was a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16. A teenage golfer from Italy was the first death to be named, though Swiss and Italian officials have so far declined to confirm his death.Swiss authorities have not released the names of the eight people whose identification was completed on Saturday - all aged 16-24. Bunches of flowers, soft toys and messages of love and hope are piled up outside the police barriers outside the bar.On Saturday, families were being directed to a conference centre just outside Crans. Members of the Italian Civil Protection team met people there, together with Italy's Ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado.Ambassador Cornado said the identification process should be completed by Sunday afternoon.The slow process is because of the severity of the burns many of the victims suffered, the ambassador added.A helpline has been set up for concerned families: +41 848 112 117",

    "body": "Two people including a three-year-old child have been killed and around 28 others injured in a Russian strike on Kharkiv, Ukrainian officials have said. A multi-storey residential apartment block was almost completely destroyed in the dual missile attack on Friday afternoon, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called \"heinous\". Russia's Defence Ministry denied reports of an attack, suggesting the blast had been caused by Ukrainian ammunition detonating.The strike comes ahead of crunch talks on a US-brokered peace plan in Kyiv on Saturday.Zelensky says around 15 countries are expected to attend the talks, along with representatives from the EU and Nato, with a US delegation joining the meeting via video link. Leaders of the so-called coalition of the willing are then set to meet in France on 6 January.Officials in Kharkiv said the bodies of a woman and a three-year-old child were found in the rubble, with preliminary information suggesting the pair may have been a mother and son. \"Unfortunately, this is how the Russians treat life and people – they continue killing, despite all efforts by the world, and especially by the United States, in the diplomatic process,\" Zelensky wrote on X.Of the 28 injured, which included a six-month-old baby, 16 have been taken to hospital. A search and rescue operation is ongoing, with more than 80 volunteers working at the scene, according to regional governor Oleh Syniehubov.The Russian Defence Ministry said in a statement on Telegram that its armed forces \"neither planned nor launched attacks using missile weapons or aircraft weapons within the city of Kharkiv\".It added that footage from before the attack showed \"heavy smoke of unknown origin\", which it cited as evidence of ammunition detonated by Ukrainian armed forces.The ministry also alleged that the reports were seeking to distract attention from a New Year's Eve strike on a hotel in a Russian-held part of the southern Kherson region of Ukraine.Russia has accused Ukraine of killing at least 27 people and injuring more than 30 others in the drone strike on a New Year's party in the village of Khorly on the Black Sea.The BBC has not been able to independently verify either these claims or the number of casualties.Ukraine told the BBC it would not directly respond to sources of information such as claims from governors of occupied regions.It added that it adhered to the norms of international humanitarian law and conducted strikes exclusively against military targets.Russia's Investigative Committee said it had opened an investigation into the attack, while the Russian foreign ministry accused Zelensky of \"seeking to intimidate the populations of the reunited Russian regions, who have forever linked their fates with Russia through referendums\".",

IS - also known as Daesh - imposed jihadist rule over parts of Syria and Iraq until 2019.\"This action shows our UK leadership, and determination to stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies, to stamp out any resurgence of Daesh and their dangerous and violent ideologies in the Middle East,\" UK Defence Secretary John Healey said.RAF aircraft have carried out patrols over Syria to \"prevent any attempted resurgence\" of IS following its defeat at the battle of Baghuz in 2019, the ministry said.\"I want to thank all the members of our armed forces involved in this operation for their professionalism and their courage,\" Healey said.\"They were among thousands of British personnel deployed over Christmas and New Year. This operation, to eliminate dangerous terrorists who threaten our way of life, shows how our armed forces are ready to step up, all year round, keeping Britain secure at home and strong abroad.\" In December, the US military carried out what it called a \"massive strike\" against IS targets in Syria, after an ambush killed two American soldiers and a civilian interpreter in Palmyra.The United Nations says IS still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.",

    "body": "13 hours agoTom McArthurGetty ImagesNetiv Haasara is a village just on the northern border of Gaza and was hit during the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023The BBC has reached an agreement with an Israeli family who survived the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks, after a team of journalists entered their badly-damaged home without permission.A BBC News crew, including International Editor Jeremy Bowen, entered the home of an Israeli family on the Gaza border and filmed inside the property in the days after the deadly attacks.They filmed personal photographs of the family's children at a time when many of their friends and relatives still didn't know whether they had survived, the Jewish News reported. A BBC spokesperson said that while they did not generally comment on specific legal issues they were pleased to have reached an agreement in the case.Tzeela Horenstein said gunmen threw a grenade at her husband Simon during Hamas' attack on the village of Netiv HaAsara early in the morning of 7 October. The couple and their two young children only survived because their home's door twisted and jammed when the attackers tried to blow it out with explosives, she told the Jewish News, who first reported the story.She said: \"Not only did terrorists break into our home and try to murder us, but then the BBC crew entered again, this time with a camera as a weapon, without permission or consent.\"It was another intrusion into our lives. We felt that everything that was still under our control had been taken from us.\"The Jewish News reported that the corporation paid a financial settlement of £28,000 to the family. The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 71,260 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "Donald Trump's warning that the US will intervene if peaceful protesters are killed was \"reckless and dangerous\", Iran's foreign minister has said.Abbas Araghchi's comments came after the US president said Washington \"will come to their rescue\" of demonstrators taking part in protests over Iran's economy, writing in a brief social media post: \"We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"Araghchi indicated Iran's armed forces were on standby and \"know exactly where to aim\" in the event of an attack.At least eight people are reported to have died during the week-long protests, as of Saturday morning.Trump wrote on Friday: \"If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"The US president did not specify what action Washington might take. Previously, it has carried out strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, which elicited a retaliatory strike on a US base in Qatar.\"Given President Trump's deployment of the National Guard within US borders, he of all people should know that criminal attacks on public property cannot be tolerated,\" Araghchi wrote on X.Iran would \"forcefully reject any interference in their internal affairs\", he added.On Saturday Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei addressed the wave of protests, saying that \"rioters must be put in their place\". He said shopkeepers' original protest about the collapse in foreign exchange rates was \"legitimate\", but he claimed people \"provoked by the enemy\" were taking advantage to shout anti-government slogans.Protests have spread to a number of cities and towns with running battles reported between security forces and demonstrators. On Saturday the state-affiliated Mehr and Fars news agencies reported that two protesters and a member of the security forces were killed in the western town of Malekshahi when, they said, protesters tried to enter a police station.The EU said it was \"concerned\" by reports of deaths and called for Tehran to exercise \"maximum restraint\" against the protesters as well as upholding their right to \"freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly\".The protests began in Tehran, with shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and the protests had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.Two people have since died in clashes between protesters and security forces in the south-western city of Lordegan, according to the semi-official Fars news agency and the human rights group Hengaw, which said they were protesters, naming them as Ahmad Jalil and Sajjad Valamanesh.Three people were killed in Azna, while another died in Kouhdasht, all in the west of the country, Fars reported. It did not specify whether they were demonstrators or security forces personnel.One death was reported in Fuladshahr, central Iran, and another casualty in Marvdasht, in the south.BBC has not been able to independently verify the deaths.The demonstrations have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly, but they have not been on the same scale.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has previously said he will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.

    "body": "21 hours agoClaire KeenanWatch: Earthquake interrupts Mexico's president during press conferenceAt least two people have died after a powerful earthquake hit southern and central Mexico on Friday.The epicentre of the 6.5 magnitude earthquake was near the popular tourist town of Acapulco, near San Marcos in the south-western state of Guerrero, which suffered moderate damage.A 50-year-old woman died in Guerrero, the state's governor Evelyn Salgado said, while Clara Brugada, Mexico City's mayor, confirmed the death of a 60-year-old man and said 12 others had been injured in the capital. Mexico is situated in one of the world's most seismically active areas, sitting at the meeting point of four tectonic plates.Late on Friday night, Brugada said power has been restored to \"98% of the failures reported\" in Mexico City.Two structures were being evaluated for risk of collapse, she said, while 34 buildings and five homes were being inspected as a preventative measure.Damage assessments are under way in Mexico City after roads and hospitals were impacted, according to news agency Reuters, while authorities noted various landslides on highways around the Guerrero state. Mexico's seismological service had registered 420 aftershocks by midday local time (18:00 GMT).President Claudia Sheinbaum was holding her first press conference of the year when the earthquake struck.  In a video capturing the moment, Sheinbaum can be heard saying \"it's shaking\" as an earthquake alert system rings in the background. She then tells the media to \"all get out calmly\". Additional footage shows buildings shaking in Mexico City and cars trembling in Acapulco.Getty ImagesThe inside of a house damaged by the quake in San Marcos, Guerrero state, MexicoAfter hearing the Mexican Seismic Alert System early on Friday, residents and tourists rushed into the streets of Mexico City and Acapulco.The seismic system was put into place following the deadly 1985 earthquake that claimed more than 10,000 lives.In 2017, a 7.1 magnitude quake killed more than 200 people and toppled dozens of buildings in Mexico City.",

He led a long life and no doubt fathered many calves,\" said the Amboseli Trust for Elephants in its farewell message.Famed for his long tusks, Craig the elephant was a major attraction at the park near the Tanzanian border. In 2021, he was named an ambassador for the popular Kenyan lager brand Tusker - a name also used for adult male elephants with tusks.The Kenya Wildlife Service described Craig as an \"icon\" of successful conservation.\"Craig was one of the last remaining super tuskers in Africa - a rare class of bull elephants whose two tusks weigh over 45kg (100lb) each. Fewer than a handful remain today, making him a living monument to Africa's natural heritage.\"The wildlife body also said \"Craig was deeply loved for [his] remarkably calm nature\", often \"pausing patiently as visitors photographed and filmed him\". \"Thanks to his many protectors, he died peacefully of natural causes.\"More than two million tourists visited Kenya last year, many of them seeking out wildlife in the country's world-famous national parks.Kenya's tourism sector accounts for 10% of national GDP, officials say.AFP via Getty ImagesCraig the elephant became a brand ambassador for Tusker five years agoYou may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "'A long road ahead': Venezuelans react to Maduro's arrest with hope and worry1 hour agoGrace Eliza Goodwin,Cristobal VasquezandTom Bateman,State department correspondentGetty ImagesProtestors held a rally in Bogota, Colombia after Nicolás Maduro's capture.As the dust settles in Caracas, Venezuelans are reacting to the news of President Nicolás Maduro's capture by the US with hope, fear, and uncertainty. People began to emerge in the streets Saturday after a night rocked by explosions in the Caracas Valley, with moods that ranged from celebration to condemnation.  Dina, a local resident, told the BBC that for now, she is grateful to the US for \"taking Maduro out of here\" because now, she \"at least can see some light at the end of the tunnel again\". But the political climate remains tense, part of why she did not give the BBC her real name. Jorge, another Venezuelan who lives near Caracas, told the BBC that while he's grateful to be \"well-supported by Trump and the entire United States\", he fears the coming days will not be easy. \"Now that they are taking this man away, what's going to happen?\" Jorge told the BBC. \"It doesn't guarantee us anything. So there is a bit of uncertainty. We don't know what the coming days will bring.\"Supporters of Maduro's government have also been rallying in the streets of Caracas, demanding the US release their leader. Caracas Mayor Carmen Meléndez, a firm government loyalist, joined in the rally to protest against what she called Maduro's \"kidnapping\". Early Saturday, US forces under President Donald Trump carried out a series of targeted attacks in Venezuela's capital, ultimately taking the country's leader into US custody. The US accuses Maduro of running a \"narco-terrorist\" regime. He is widely seen by opponents within his country as well as by foreign governments as having illegitimately won Venezuela's 2024 election. Maduro - who leads the United Socialist Party and has been in power since 2013 - has frequently been accused of repressing opposition groups and silencing dissent in Venezuela, at times with the use of violence.As Maduro and his wife are extradited to New York City to face drug trafficking and weapons charges, the future of Venezuela remains unclear. Trump has said the US will run the country - and manage its oil reserves - until a permanent replacement for Maduro can be established. Maduro has previously rejected US claims he has direct involvement in drug trafficking.But even for those who are grateful to see Maduro gone, there's still a lot of fear and uncertainty, several Venezuelans told the BBC.Dina isn't putting much faith in Trump. \"He says something now and tomorrow he changes his mind,\" Dina said of Trump. \"I mean, I'm not used to taking his words seriously.\"The \"only thing that was good\" about what Trump has said since Maduro's capture, Dina said, is that the US will be investing in Venezuela, which she hopes will lead to \"a better economic situation\" for the struggling country. Venezuela VP: Maduro is 'the only president'The danger of speaking out against Maduro is still very real within Venezuela, as the National Assembly - which is dominated by Maduro loyalists - passed a law a few weeks ago declaring anyone who expresses support for US naval blockades a \"traitor\".Jorge said he saw motorcyclists from colectivos, which are pro-government paramilitary groups in Venezuela, roaming the streets with weapons yesterday. \"It makes you a bit afraid to even go out to buy bread right now,\" he said. \"We'll have to wait for the best and have patience.\"Jorge added that he's worried about the influence of Maduro's ally, Diosdado Cabello, Venezuela's Minister of Interior, Justice and Peace.\"He is a very bad person, very spiteful,\" Jorge said of Cabello. \"I don't know how many people he has on his side. Hopefully, the army stands with the people and he loses some control.\"Sandra echoed Jorge and Dina's relief at Maduro's ousting. But, she too is skeptical about the future and what it means for Venezuelans in exile. Close to eight million Venezuelans have left Venezuela since Maduro came to power - and many of them have been openly celebrating Maduro's capture in the streets of the cities where they have settled.In addition to the millions in exile, others are \"missing, imprisoned, dead, or merely surviving\", — which is \"a true tragedy that had not been addressed by any country\", Sandra said. \"This is only the beginning; we know there is still a long road ahead,\" Sandra added. \"No country had previously heard the cry of Venezuelans in the face of this tragedy\". Tom Bateman and Kristina Volk contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Leaders around the world have responded with a mix of condemnation and support to the US capture of Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro. Following a large-scale strike on Venezuela on Saturday, Maduro and his wife were captured by US forces and removed from the country. The pair have been indicted on drug charges in New York. In an initial response, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his government would \"shed no tears\" for the end of Maduro's regime.Neighbouring Latin American countries condemned the actions, as did Venezuela's long-term allies, Russia and China. China said it was \"deeply shocked and strongly condemns\" the use of force against a sovereign country and its president. Russia accused the US of committing \"an act of armed aggression\".Iran, which is locked in its own dispute with Trump over his promise of intervention in its country, called the strikes a \"flagrant violation of the country's national sovereignty\".Trump said the US will \"run\" Venezuela \"until we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition\". Many Latin American leaders condemned the US actions. President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva in Brazil wrote on X that the actions \"cross an unacceptable line\", adding \"attacking countries in flagrant violation of international law is the first step toward a world of violence, chaos, and instability\". Colombian President Gustavo Petro called the strikes an \"assault on the sovereignty\" of Latin America, while Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel described it as a \"criminal attack\".Chile's President Gabriel Boric expressed \"concern and condemnation\" on X and called for \"a peaceful solution to the serious crisis affecting the country\".Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Cane accused the US of a \"criminal attack\", while Uruguay said in an official statement it was monitoring developments \"with attention and serious concern\" and \"rejects, as it always has, military intervention\".Trump has indicated that Cuba could become part of a broader US policy in the region, calling it a failing nation. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Cuba was a disaster run by incompetent leaders who supported Maduro's administration. He said the government in Havana should be concernedThe Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello urged citizens to remain calm and to trust the country's leadership and military, saying, \"The world needs to speak out about this attack,\" according to the Reuters news agency. But Argentinian President Javier Milei – who Trump has described as his \"favourite president\" – wrote \"Freedom moves forward\" and \"Long live freedom\" on social media.LIVE REACTION: Captured Venezuelan leader Maduro arrives in New York after US strikesMeanwhile UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer refused to be drawn into whether or not the military action may have broken international law.In an interview with the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme on Saturday morning, the prime minister did not condemn the US strikes.He said he was waiting to establish all the facts but would not \"shy away from this\", adding he was a \"lifelong advocate of international law\".The UK was not involved in the strikes and Sir Keir said he had not spoken to Trump about the operation.Later on Saturday, Sir Keir posted on X that the UK \"regarded Maduro as an illegitimate president and we shed no tears about the end of his regime\".\"The UK government will discuss the evolving situation with US counterparts in the days ahead as we seek a safe and peaceful transition to a legitimate government that reflects the will of the Venezuelan people,\" he added.The EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas reiterated the bloc's position that Maduro lacks legitimacy, that there should be a peaceful transition of power, and that the principles of international law must be respected.French President Emmanuel Macron said the transition of power \"must be peaceful, democratic, and respectful of the will of the Venezuelan people\" in a post on X.He added he hoped González - the opposition's 2024 presidential candidate - could ensure the transition.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the legality of the US operation was \"complex\" and international law in general must apply. He warned that \"political instability must not be allowed to arise in Venezuela\".UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was \"deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected\", his spokesperson said. He was \"deeply alarmed\" by the strikes, which set a \"dangerous precedent\". He called on all actors in Venezuela to engage in inclusive dialogue, in full respect of human rights and the rule of law\".In the US, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said, \"Let me be clear, Maduro is an illegitimate dictator, but launching military action without congressional authorization, without a federal plan for what comes next, is reckless\"",

    "body": "The year angry men dominated Bollywood - and what it means for India 1 day agoYasser UsmanFilm writerJio StudiosRanveer Singh's Dhurandhar was the biggest hit last yearFor the Indian film industry, 2025 felt like a return to familiar ground.The year before that, women-led stories had briefly reshaped India's global cinematic image, bringing accolades and new attention. But last year, Bollywood's violent, male-driven action thrillers dominated the domestic box-office and cultural conversations.In the last weeks of 2025, Indian social media was swamped with discussions about a single juggernaut: Dhurandhar, an espionage thriller set in the backdrop of India-Pakistan tensions.Packed with graphic violence and gangland politics, the film became the defining hit of the year, cementing its place in a crop of aggressive, hypermasculine films that drove popular discourse.The trend was a stark contrast to 2024, when a number of films made by women - Payal Kapadia's All We Imagine As Light, Shuchi Talati's Girls Will Be Girls and Kiran Rao's Laapataa Ladies - got global attention and praise. \"What 2024 established was that Indian women filmmakers are not marginal voices, but leading global ones,\" says film critic Mayank Shekhar, calling it \"a moment of truth\" rather than a trend.The hope was that richer, more textured stories about women would grow both in number and popularity. Instead, in 2025 the top 10 box-office hits - five of them from Bollywood, a small relief for a Hindi film industry still struggling to regain its footing after the pandemic - were dominated by larger-than-life, hypermasculine heroes, from the historical epic Chhaava to the action spectacle War 2. The only film on the list led by a woman was an outlier: the Malayalam-language superhero film Lokah.It wasn't just action thrillers that put men at the centre. Blockbuster romance Saiyaara followed a troubled male rockstar who ultimately \"rescues\" his partner who is struggling with Alzheimer's disease. Even mythical spectacles such as Kantara: Chapter 1 (Kannada) and Mahavatar Narsimha (dubbed into several languages) doubled down on traditional male heroism.The year's most talked-about films were dominated by images of men performing pain, power and vengeance at full volume.T Series FilmsTere Ishk Mein was southern superstar Dhanush's biggest Hindi film hitOut of the top 10, one of the year's most debated hits was Tere Ishk Mein, which features an angry, volatile male protagonist and a high-achieving woman whose ambitions are eclipsed by his obsessive love. Despite criticism for romanticising toxic masculinity, the film became actor Dhanush's highest-grossing Hindi release, earning more than 1,550m rupees ($17.26m, £12.77m) worldwide.Another surprise hit was Ek Deewane Ki Deewaniyat, a relatively small-budget romance drama with a hero who, as a review put it, is \"an obsessive lover who refuses to take no for an answer\".2024 offered \"a glimpse of what's possible\", says Priyanka Basu, a senior lecturer in Performing Arts at King's College London.She points out that Hindi cinema has historically marginalised women protagonists, adding that the male-centred industry has long had stark inequalities in casting, pay and opportunities. \"Just one year to change that is unrealistic. We need more such years, and more stories that put women front and centre,\" she says.Indian cinema's, and especially Bollywood's, fixation with the macho hero goes back to Amitabh Bachchan's \"angry young man\" image of the 1970s. Even the romantic era of superstars like Shah Rukh Khan offered only a brief detour - one he has since abandoned in favour of action-heavy blockbusters such as Pathaan and Jawan.The trend has carried onto streaming platforms as well - once seen as alternative spaces where women-centric storytelling could succeed.A recent report by media research company Ormax analysing 338 Hindi shows on streaming platforms showed that action and crime thrillers, mostly male-led, now make up 43% of the titles; female-led stories have fallen from 31% in 2022 to just 12% in 2025.\"At some point, OTT (over-the-top, or streaming) platforms began chasing box-office logic,\" Mr Shekhar says. \"Streaming now mirrors theatrical trends instead of challenging them.\"Wayfarer FilmsLokah, starring Kalyani Priyadarshan, was the only woman-centric film in the year's top 10Trade experts argue that the shift reflects audience demand rather than creative regression in the industry.\"Indian films have traditonally been male-led but we have also had female-centric classics like Mother India and Pakeezah,\" says analyst Taran Adarsh.The accusations of toxicity, he says, come from a \"handful of critics\" and can't change the fate of films.\"At the end of the day, the only verdict that matters is that of the audience,\" he adds.But attributing everything to audience tastes is an oversimplification, argues Anu Singh Choudhary, co-writer of Delhi Crime 3, the third season of a Netflix thriller that highlighted the issue of women-trafficking through a feminist lens.\"Macho blockbusters have existed for long because they reflect a society that's always been patriarchal and male-dominated. Will that change overnight? No. But as the world order changes, so will our films,\" she says.There's also the economic reality. Producers, distributors and exhibitors control the number of screens, marketing and visibility any film gets - and that often depends on the bankability of the male star. Independent and women-led films face an uphill battle, particularly if they are not fronted by big stars.Films nowadays are also going through a \"period of performative, exaggerated misogyny\", says screenwriter Atika Chohan, whose work includes women-led films Chhapaak and Margarita With a Straw.Some of this, she thinks, is a response to the accountability demanded by women during the MeToo movement of 2017-19.While the movement exposed widespread abuse within the film industry, its impact was uneven. Some of the accused faced temporary setbacks, but most returned to work and structural power imbalances largely remain.\"As long as these [hypermasculine] films make money, they aren't going anywhere,\" Ms Chohan says.But as always, there are signs of hope, mostly from smaller, regional film industries and independent filmmakers. A new generation of independent filmmakers in India is making \"riveting, viable cinema\" instead of \"mass entertainers,\" Ms Choudhary points out.Sharp indies such as Sabar Bonda and Songs of Forgotten Trees dug into complex social and political layers and told sensitive stories of relationships. The Telugu film The Girlfriend told the story of a woman in a toxic relationship learning to free herself, while Bad Girl (Tamil) was hailed as a successful coming-of-age drama told through a woman's lens. In Malayalam cinema, Feminichi Fathima - with \"Feminichi\" a social-media distortion of \"feminist\" - used humour to follow a Muslim housewife's quiet rebellion against patriarchy. On the streaming side, The Great Shamsuddin Family has been praised for capturing the everyday resilience and complexities of modern Muslim women.\"It's a quieter movement, working from the margins,\" says Ms Choudhary. \"And it isn't going to disappear.\"",

The quake shook Guerrero, Mexico, early Friday, disrupting Sheinbaum's first news conference of the year.

The epicenter was near the town of San Marcos, close to the Pacific coast resort of Acapulco, according to Mexico's national seismological agency.

People with listeriosis can develop sepsis - a life-threatening overreaction by the immune system.</p></div><div><p>The regional authority confirmed that infection tracing, initially covering guests who ate at the restaurant between 25 and 27 September, had since been widened to include people who dined there from 23 and 24 September.</p><p>\"Those with ongoing symptoms such as fever, vomiting or diarrhoea are now recommended to visit a hospital emergency room for assessment,\" Maria Rotzén Östlund, an infectious disease physician, told state broadcaster SVT.</p><p>Regional health officials warned in a press release that \"a large number of people may have been infected\" and emphasised that listeria posed the greatest risk to pregnant women, older people and those with weakened immune systems.</p><p>As of Thursday evening, 85 people have complained of having food poisoning after dining at the restaurant with a city tracking tool, officials said. Around 400 people have been contacted for infection tracing.</p><p>Four people had sepsis but none had needed intensive care, the broadcaster quoted infectious disease specialist Maria Rotzén Östlund as saying.</p><p>Coco & Carmen has temporarily closed while an investigation into the cause of the suspected outbreak continues. </p><p>The restaurant said in a statement that it had always passed food safety inspections and was co-operating with the authorities.</p><p>\"We take this extremely seriously and as the well-being of our guests is our top priority, we have voluntarily closed until further notice,\" the owners said, adding that they hoped to reopen on 7 October.</p><p>Joakim Almquist, the chef and co-owner, told SVT: \"The only thing I can do is sincerely apologise, because I suffer with these people.\"</p><p>Listeria is commonly found in soil, water and animals, and can spread through contaminated food, particularly when stored in cold conditions for long periods. </p><p>While most people experience only mild symptoms resembling stomach flu, it can lead to severe illness such as meningitis or sepsis. The incubation period can stretch from several days to three weeks.</p><p><i>Additional reporting by Kathryn Armstrong</i></p></div>",

He will always be the same cruel, power-hungry, manipulative man that he is.\" </p><p>In his letter, Combs describes teaching a class to fellow inmates on \"what I did to become a successful business man\", describing himself as a changed person who is now sober for the first time in 25 years. </p><p>\"The old me died in jail and new version of me was reborn,\" he writes. </p><p>Combs goes on to ask the judge for mercy, \"not only for my sake, but for the sake of my children\". He asked the judge to consider his seven kids, and his 84-year-old mother who recently had brain surgery. </p><p>He notes that the judge might be tempted to make an example out of him and instead asks that he be made an example of \"what a person can do if afforded a second chance\". </p><p>Combs is also expected to speak in court on Friday before the judge issues his sentence. Four of his lawyers are also slated to speak, and his defence team also plans to show a 15-minute video. It's unclear what the video may include.</p><p>In July, a jury acquitted him of the most severe charges: racketeering and sex trafficking - which could have resulted in him spending the rest of his life behind bars. He was found guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.</p><p>Prosecutors say he is \"unrepentant\" and argued the rapper should spend a minimum of 11 years in prison. </p><p>\"The defendant tries to recast decades of abuse as simply the function of mutually toxic relationships,\" prosecutors wrote in a 29 September filing. \"But there is nothing mutual about a relationship where one person holds all the power and the other ends up bloodied and bruised.\"</p></div>",

    "body": "<div><p>The director of the Dwight D Eisenhower Presidential Library has stepped down after a dispute with the Trump administration over gifting a sword in its collection to King Charles, according to the BBC's US partner, CBS News. </p><p>Todd Arrington, the head of the library in Kansas, resigned on Monday after declining to remove an original sword from the library's collection to give to the King during President Donald Trump's visit to the United Kingdom last month, CBS reported, citing anonymous sources. </p><p>Charles was instead gifted a replica during Trump's UK visit, Buckingham Palace said at the time. </p><p>In an interview with CBS News, Arrington said he was told to \"Resign - or be fired\". </p></div><div><p>\"Apparently, they believed I could no longer be trusted with confidential information,\" Arrington told the outlet, saying the confidential information was related to the sword dispute and an unrelated matter.  </p><p>The BBC has contacted the White House, the National Archives and Eisenhower library for comment. </p><p>US State Department officials were seeking to gift an Eisenhower sword to emphasize the importance of the US-UK relationship after World War II, but Arrington declined and said they couldn't hand over an artifact that was accepted as a donation, sources told CBS News. </p><p>The outlet said it was not clear who in particular requested the sword to present to the king. </p><p>Arrington reportedly offered to try to find a different gift, including a replica, but State Department officials continued to request the original sword. </p><p>Ultimately, the president and First Lady Melania Trump gave the King a replica of one of Eisenhower's swords at Windsor Castle in September. They also gave the Queen a Tiffany & Co vintage 18-carat gold, diamond and ruby flower brooch.</p><p>The situation led to Trump administration officials being unhappy with Arrington, CBS News reported. </p><p>Arrington disputed that he had made negative remarks about Trump and his administration. </p><p>\"That is 100% incorrect,\" he told CBS News. \"I never said a bad word about anybody. I talked to colleagues about trying to find a sword or artifact, something we could give to them for the president to give to the King, and at no time did I disparage anyone.\"</p><p>The Eisenhower library has several swords from the president in its collection, including a saber and a sword of honour featured in a current exhibit. Eisenhower, who was the 34th president from 1953 to 1961, served as the supreme commander of the allied forces in Europe during World War II. </p><p>Arrington had been working as director of the Eisenhower library since August 2024. It is one of 16 presidential libraries in the US that are run by the National Archives. </p><p>The US archivist is responsible for hiring library directors, and the White House does not have a say in the firing and hiring of these employees. </p><p>Arrington told CBS that he wanted to go back to his job. </p><p>\"I'd return to this job in a heartbeat,\" he said. \"I love the job, I love the people, I love the history. I never in a million years wanted this to happen.\"</p></div>",

    "body": "<div><p>US federal workers have described their state of uncertainty, with many now on unpaid leave due to a government shutdown and one remarking that their salary was being \"held hostage\".</p><p>Workers deemed to be essential may still be on duty or at their desks, but they too may not be paid while the shutdown lasts.</p><p>A government shutdown is a familiar situation in the US, and can happen whenever Congress fails to vote through an annual budget. This one began on Wednesday, and this deadlock is characterised by partisan disputes over federal spending and Democratic demands to extend healthcare tax credits.</p><p>What makes this shutdown different is the fact that President Donald Trump hopes to use the opportunity to make permanent cuts to government staffing and spending.</p><p>BBC News has been speaking to federal workers about their views and how the shutdown has affected them.</p><p>Although most of the comments below are anonymous, we have verified that the speakers are federal workers. US government staff are generally forbidden from speaking to the media, and we have protected the speakers' identities because they could face disciplinary action if they are named.</p></div><div><p>\"The last shutdown was brutal\", said one federal worker, who highlighted that the impasse in 2018-19 lasted more than a month.</p><p>He added: \"It forced me to withdraw money from my retirement plan just to cover my bills. Now, they've made it more difficult to withdraw from our retirement accounts, so if this goes as long as the last shutdown, I don't know how I'm going to pay my bills.\"</p><p>The same worker said: \"I voted for Trump, but I did not vote for his abuses against us.\"</p><p>Another worker, for the Department of Homeland Security, based in New Jersey, took a slightly different view: \"Despite working without timely pay, I support the shutdown.\" </p><p>He explained: \"The president's circumvention of Congress' power of the purse has been left unchecked by the Supreme Court. Checks and balances must be maintained.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, a worker for Army Corps of Engineers said she was \"rather conflicted\" and did not mind a break from the \"gruelling end of fiscal year - a year full of constantly shifting guidance and the ever-present threat\" of a mass firing.</p><p>She said she would \"support a shutdown if anything productive comes of it, but I'm unsure anything will\".</p><p>Randall from Kansas City, who works with the Aviation Weather Center, said: \"I don't like my pay being held hostage while the government fights over separate issues.\"</p><p>He said he believed that keeping the National Weather Service funded was something both parties typically agreed, so asked why he was \"facing sudden loss of funds because Congress is fighting over healthcare or whatever\". He emphasised that these were his personal views, and not those of his agency.</p><p>An anonymous US Air Force employee told us that if the situation was not resolved, he would have nothing to live on. He expressed his dilemma as follows: \"I must still show up to work but won't get paid, because if I don't it's considered AWOL\".</p><p>A worker at the Department of the Treasury had a message to the party holding out against the spending plans of Trump's Republican party.</p><p>\"I strongly implore Democrats to stand firm and not cave to the continued assault on healthcare and affordability for everyday Americans,\" she said. She added that no amount of threats to her job would cause her to waver in her views.</p></div><p><i>Additional reporting by Kris Bramwell, Mary Litchfield, Alex Akhurst and Imogen James</i></p>",

    "body": "<div><p>At least two people have been killed in Morocco after police opened fire to prevent   protesters from storming a police station in Lqliaa, near the coastal city of Agadir, state media says.</p><p>These are the first deaths reported since huge youth-led protests broke out across Morocco on Saturday as anger grew over the government's decision to build football stadiums for the 2030 Fifa World Cup rather than improving public services and tackling the economic crisis.</p><p>\"Stadiums are here, but where are the hospitals?\" is a popular chant among the Gen Z protesters.</p><p>One demonstrator told BBC Newsday that the hospital in his city, Oujda, on the border with Algeria, was like a \"jail\".</p></div><div><p>It was dirty, and patients had to bribe security officers and nurses to see a doctor, said the protester, who spoke on condition of anonymity as he feared reprisals.</p><p>The protests have been happening at night, with police saying they were forced to open fire \"in legitimate self-defence\" on Wednesday evening to repel the \"attack\"  in Lqliaa, the state-owned news agency reported.</p></div><div><p>Earlier on Wednesday, the interior ministry said the right of people to protest within the law would be upheld. </p><p>Organisers of the youth-led protest movement known as GenZ 212 - the number referring to Morocco's international dialling code - have distanced themselves from the violence. They have been rallying mainly through social media, and do not have a formal leadership structure. </p><p>Official statistics show that Morocco's unemployment rate stands at 12.8%, with youth unemployment soaring to 35.8% and 19% among graduates, news agency Reuters reports. </p><p>Protests have also hit the capital, Rabat, the main commercial city, Casablanca, and the port city of Tangier - the arrival point for tourists going to Morocco by ferry from Spain. </p><p>Morocco's tourist hub, Marrakesh, was also hit by violence, with protesters burning a police station, according to local media.</p><p>Interior ministry spokesman Rachid El Khalfi said that 409 people have been  detained across Morocco following the unrest. </p><p>More than 260 police officers and 20 protesters have been injured, while 40 police vehicles and 20 private cars have been torched, he was quoted as saying.</p><p>The uprising follows similar youth-led, large scale demonstrations this summer in Nepal, Indonesia, the Philippines and Madagascar.</p><p>The uprising in Nepal led to the prime minister resigning, while Madagascar's president dissolved his government on Monday in an attempt to placate the protesters there.</p><p>Morocco's governing coalition issued a statement on Tuesday expressing willingness to engage in dialogue with the youth \"within institutions and public spaces to find realistic solutions\".</p><p>It also praised what it called \"the balanced reaction of security authorities in line with relevant legal procedures\".</p></div>",

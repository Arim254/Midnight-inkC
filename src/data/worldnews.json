    "body": "8 hours agoBen MilneandJames Percy,BBC NewsBBCThe first non-European Pope in more than 1,000 years, the Oscar-winning star of Annie Hall and The Godfather, a soul legend and one of the world's most famous designers - here are some of the well-known faces no longer with us.Among those we remember are Hollywood stars Robert Redford, Diane Keaton and Gene Hackman, and theatrical dames Joan Plowright and Patricia Routledge.Robert RedfordGetty ImagesRobert Redford's acting career spanned more than 50 films and won him an Oscar as a director. For many filmgoers though, he was simply the best-looking cinema star in the world - once described as \"a chunk of Mount Rushmore levered into stonewashed denims\". As well as leading roles in hits such as All The President's Men, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Way We Were, Redford also launched the Sundance Film Festival to champion independent filmmakers.Read moreDiane KeatonGetty ImagesLos-Angeles-born Keaton shot to fame with her role in The Godfather, but enjoyed a long creative partnership with Woody Allen. Annie Hall, a comedy based on their off-screen relationship, earned her a Best Actress Oscar and they collaborated on several other films. She was nominated for three further Oscars - all in the best actress category - for her work in Something's Gotta Give, Marvin's Room and Reds.Read morePrunella ScalesGetty Images\"BASIL!\" - the unmistakable sound of Sybil Fawlty admonishing her pompous and incompetent husband, is probably how Prunella Scales will best be remembered.  Apart from starring in sitcom Fawlty Towers, she played many other roles on screen and stage, including Queen Elizabeth II in Alan Bennett's play, A Question of Attribution. She also enjoyed an unlikely hit late in life with Channel 4's Great Canal Journeys, travelling waterways in the UK and elsewhere with her husband, the actor Timothy West.Read moreDavid LynchGetty ImagesPerhaps the most avant-garde filmmaker ever to make it big in Hollywood, David Lynch brought surrealism to the big screen in films including Mulholland Drive and Blue Velvet. However, his groundbreaking TV series Twin Peaks remained for many his greatest work - portraying an idyllic American small town encroached by a chaotic unconscious world.Read moreMalcolm-Jamal WarnerGetty ImagesBest known for his role as Theo Huxtable on The Cosby Show, Malcolm-Jamal Warner starred in the hugely popular US sitcom from 1984-1992. He had been handpicked for his breakout role on the final day of a nationwide audition - \"I was literally the last person they saw,\" he recalled in a 2023 interview. More recently, Warner appeared in several television programmes including Malcom & Eddie, and The Resident.Read moreGene HackmanGetty ImagesAs New York cop Popeye Doyle in the 1971 film The French Connection, Gene Hackman's cemented his reputation as one of Hollywood's great tough guys. That role won him his first acting Oscar (the second was for the 1992 Western, Unforgiven). Hackman also showed a gift for comedy in The Royal Tennenbaums and Young Frankenstein, among others.Read moreDharmendraGetty ImagesDubbed the \"original He-Man of Bollywood\", Dharmendra was one of India's most famous film stars, with a career that spanned seven decades and more than 300 films. He could turn his hand to romance, action roles or comedy. One of his most popular films was the 1975 blockbuster, Sholay, where he played a petty criminal hired by the police to capture a villain. Dharmendra always said he was \"embarrassed\" by talk of his good looks and attributed it to \"nature, my parents and my genes\".Read moreDame Joan PlowrightGetty ImagesBorn in Lincolnshire, Joan Plowright became a leading lady in London's West End in the 1950s. She appeared opposite Sir Laurence Olivier - the man she later married - in John Osborne's The Entertainer at the Royal Court in 1957. Her career lasted more than 60 years, earning her awards for both stage and screen roles. In 2004, she was made a Dame of the British Empire.Read moreVal KilmerGetty Images\"The most unsung leading man of his generation,\" according to one movie critic, Val Kilmer starred as Tom Cruise's rival in Top Gun, Jim Morrison in The Doors and (less happily) Batman, taking over the role from Michael Keaton. In the early 2000s, the starring roles dried up, and in 2014, Kilmer was diagnosed with throat cancer. Chemotherapy and radiation left him with a tube in his trachea and difficulty breathing - something that was written into his final role, reprising his \"Iceman\" character in the 2022 Top Gun sequel.Read moreTerence StampGetty ImagesA stalwart of swinging London in the 1960s, Terence Stamp became famous for a string of films including Billy Budd, Modesty Blaise and Far From The Madding Crowd - as well as dating icons of that decade, Julie Christie and Jean Shrimpton. In the 1970s he took a break from acting, before returning as Superman villain General Zod, and later starring as a transgender woman Bernadette Bassenger in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.Read moreBrigitte BardotGetty ImagesFrench actress who swept away cinema's staid 1950s' portrayal of women and personified a new age of sexual liberation. On screen, Brigitte Bardot was a cocktail of kittenish charm and continental sensuality, but it was an image she grew to loathe - eventually abandoning her career to campaign for animal welfare. Later, Bardot's reputation was damaged after she made homophobic slurs and was fined multiple times for inciting racial hatred.Read moreClaudia CardinaleGetty ImagesTunisian-born, Claudia Cardinale had a six-decade-long career, rising to fame during the golden age of Italian cinema. She shot to fame in 1963 when she appeared in Federico Fellini's Oscar-winning 8 1/2 and Luchino Visconti's epic period drama The Leopard. She also worked in Hollywood in the 1960s, starring in The Pink Panther, where co-star David Niven paid her the best compliment she said she ever received: \"Claudia, along with spaghetti, you're Italy's greatest invention.\"Read moreDame Patricia RoutledgeDame Patricia Routledge was best known as Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced \"Bouquet\") in the BBC sitcom Keeping Up Appearances. \"She's an absolute monster and I enjoyed playing her enormously,\" said the actress. Other comic roles included her monologues as Kitty in Victoria Wood: As Seen On TV (\"I could've married, I've given gallons of blood and I can't stomach whelks, so that's me for you\"). Success in TV followed a long career on stage, both in the West End and on Broadway.Read moreGraham GreeneGetty ImagesCanadian actor Graham Greene is best remembered for his role as Kicking Bird in the 1990 Western, Dances With Wolves. It was a part for which he received an Oscar nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category. In real life, Greene was a member of the Oneida Nation, part of the Six Nations Reserve in southern Ontario.

Other films he appeared in included The Green Mile, Die Hard With A Vengeance and Maverick.Read morePauline CollinsGetty ImagesAs Shirley Valentine, the frustrated Liverpool housewife who finds romance on a Greek island, Pauline Collins achieved international fame and an Oscar nomination.

The Glaswegian comic actor specialised in parodies of television and Hollywood films, where he played most of the parts. He also appeared in the ITV children's show Mr Majeika before retiring from television in 1990, but he continued to appear as a panto dame in Scotland for several more years.Read moreRob ReinerGetty ImagesOne of Hollywood's best known filmmakers, responsible for a string of much-loved films across a range of genres. Reiner's work encompassed the classic comedies This Is Spinal Tap and When Harry Met Sally, the courtroom drama A Few Good Men, and the tense thriller Misery.

After the 9/11 attacks, Dick Cheney was one of the main driving forces behind the \"war on terror\" that followed, and central to the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. Although known as a drier-than-dry conservative, he was a bitter critic of President Donald Trump, arguing in 2024 that there had \"never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic\".Read moreLord Norman TebbitGetty ImagesAs one of Margaret Thatcher's closest political allies, Norman Tebbit revelled in his combative reputation (he was once described as \"a semi-house-trained polecat\" by a Labour opponent). He also gave the 1980s one of its most memorable political soundbites when he described how his father \"got on his bike to look for work\".He left the Conservative Cabinet in 1987 to care for his wife, who had been left disabled by the Brighton bomb attack three years earlier.Read moreBaroness Jenny RandersonPA MediaLiberal Democrat politician Jenny Randerson became the first female Liberal Democrat minister anywhere, when she was appointed Wales's Minister for Culture, Sport and the Welsh Language in 2000.

In 1972 he founded the Front National, a party committed to stopping immigration. Le Pen's attempts to win the presidency foundered, although he finished runner-up in 2002.

Later in life, Faithfull enjoyed a second act (and a new, gravelly, vocal range) with LPs such as Broken English, and collaborations with artists including Nick Cave and Tom Waits.Read moreOzzy OsbourneGetty ImagesAs frontman for Black Sabbath - the Birmingham band many consider to have invented heavy metal - John \"Ozzy\" Osbourne gained a reputation as the \"wild man of rock\" (he once bit a bat's head off) both on stage and off. In the 2000s, he became one of the first stars of reality TV in The Osbournes, charting the everyday life of a rock superstar and his family.Read moreJimmy CliffGetty ImagesOne of the first stars of reggae music, Jimmy Cliff brought the sound of Jamaica to a global audience with hits such as Many Rivers To Cross, Beautiful People and You Can Get It If You Really Want.

Their first (self-titled) LP was later named the greatest British album of all time by the Observer and the NME. It combined influences from rock, dance and funk, all underpinned by Mani's basslines. After the group disbanded in 1996, he joined Scottish rock band Primal Scream.Read moreRoberta FlackGetty ImagesSoul singer Roberta Flack trained as a classical pianist.

Sadly, Stone's career stalled in the mid-1970s as a result of drug abuse, and at one point he was reported to have been left homeless.Read moreBrian WilsonGetty ImagesFounder member of the Beach Boys, Brian Wilson was one of pop music's greatest composers. The group's early songs, such as California Girls and I Get Around painted a picture of US west-coast surfers living the good life, while the 1966 LP, Pet Sounds, showcased Wilson's genius for complex melodies and intricate harmonies. Fragile mental health led to his withdrawal from the Beach Boys in the 1970s, but he overcame his demons to perform again late in life.Read moreD'AngeloGetty ImagesSinger who pioneered neo-soul, a genre blending R&B with other types of music, including hip-hop and jazz, D'Angelo rose to fame in the 1990s with his debut album Brown Sugar.

From his election onwards, he turned down many privileges traditionally accorded to the Pope. His early actions in the office included washing the feet of the elderly and prisoners and advocating for the rights of refugees and migrants.Francis's papacy heralded several reforms to the Catholic Church, but on many of its teachings, he was a traditionalist. He was at times supportive of some kind of same-sex unions for gay couples, but did not favour calling it marriage. He also took part in an anti-abortion march in Rome - calling for rights of the unborn \"from the moment of conception\".He died on Easter Monday, less than 24 hours after his last public appearance, in front of a crowd of worshippers at St Peter's Square in the Vatican.Read moreGiorgio ArmaniGetty ImagesItalian fashion designer who revolutionised the look of men's and women's suits in the 1960s, introducing softer styles for menswear and power suits for women - \"I realised that they needed a way to dress that was equivalent to that of men,\" he said.

    "body": "7 hours agoKayla EpsteinGetty ImagesTatiana Schlossberg, the granddaughter of former US President John F Kennedy, has died aged 35.Her family announced her death in a social media post shared by the John F Kennedy Library Foundation, writing: \"Our beautiful Tatiana passed away this morning. She will always be in our hearts.\"In November, Schlossberg, a climate journalist, announced her diagnosis of an aggressive form of cancer. She said in an essay that she had been given less than a year to live.Schlossberg was the daughter of designer Edwin Schlossberg and diplomat Caroline Kennedy, and is survived by her husband George Moran and their two children, three-year-old Edwin and one-year-old Josephine.In an article published last month in The New Yorker titled, \"A Battle With My Blood,\" Schlossberg revealed she had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia in May 2024, after giving birth to her second child.\"My first thought was that my kids, whose faces live permanently on the inside of my eyelids, wouldn't remember me,\" she wrote.Schlossberg described the treatments she received, including chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant, but shared that doctors did not give her a good prognosis.She also wrote of the pain she feared her passing would cause for her family, which has endured multiple personal tragedies. Her grandfather, President Kennedy, was assassinated in 1963 and her uncle, John F Kennedy Jr, died in a plane crash in 1999. Her younger brother, Jack Schlossberg, is running for Congress in New York.\"For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry,\" Schlossberg wrote.\"Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life, and there's nothing I can do to stop it,\" she said.In her essay, Schlossberg also expressed disappointment in her relative Robert F Kennedy Jr's appointment to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Another relative, Maria Shriver, a journalist and the former first lady of California, paid tribute to her \"sweet, beloved Tatiana\" as someone who \"loved her life\".\"She created a beautiful life with her extraordinary husband George, and children Eddie and Josie. She fought like a warrior. She was valiant, strong, courageous.\"\"Tatiana was a great journalist, and she used her words to educate others about the earth and how to save it\", Shriver wrote on Instagram.AFP via Getty ImagesPrince William, Jack Schlossberg, Tatiana Schlossberg and Caroline Kennedy pictured in 2022 at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in BostonBefore her widely-read essay about her diagnosis, Schlossberg forged a successful career as a climate journalist.Schlossberg authored the book \"Inconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Don't Know You Have\". She also wrote about climate and other beats for the New York Times.In December 2021, she reported on local experiments to harness the energy of the London Underground to provide heat to homes, in an effort to fight climate change.\"I think climate change is the biggest story in the world, and it's a story about everything,\" she told NBC News in 2019. \"It's about science and nature, but it's also about politics and health and business. To me, looking at this as a journalist, it seemed like a really important story to tell.\"\"And if I could help communicate about it, that might inspire other people to get involved and work on the issue,\" she said.",

    "body": "Protests and strikes in Iran over inflation and currency devaluation have spread from the capital, Tehran, to several other cities on a third day of unrest.The protests began on Sunday after shopkeepers in Tehran's Grand Bazaar staged a strike when the Iranian rial hit a record low against the US dollar on the open market.Since then, videos verified by BBC Persian have shown demonstrations in the cities of Karaj, Hamedan, Qeshm, Malard, Isfahan, Kermanshah, Shiraz and Yazd. Police were also seen using tear gas in an attempt to disperse demonstrators.The Iranian government said it \"recognises the protests\" and would listen \"with patience, even if it is confronted with harsh voices\".President Masoud Pezeshkian wrote on X late on Monday that he had instructed the interior minister to hold talks with what he described as \"representatives\" of the protesters so that measures could be taken \"to resolve the problems and act responsibly\".He also accepted the resignation of Iran's central bank governor, Mohammadreza Farzin, and named former economy and finance minister Abdolnasser Hemmati to replace him.University students have also joined the protests, chanting anti-government slogans including \"Death to the dictator\" - a reference to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate power in Iran.Some protesters were also heard chanting slogans in support of the son of the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, including \"Long live the Shah\".In response, Reza Pahlavi, who lives in exile in the United States, wrote on X: \"I am with you. Victory is ours because our cause is just and because we are united.\"\"As long as this regime remains in power, the country's economic situation will continue to deteriorate,\" he added.The US state department's Persian-language account on X also expressed support for the protests.It said the US \"praises their courage\" and stands with those seeking \"dignity and a better future\" after years of failed policies and economic mismanagement.Iran was reportedly high on the agenda of a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Florida on Monday,At a joint news conference afterwards, Trump declined to say whether he supported regime change in Iran, but said: \"They've got a lot of problems: tremendous inflation, their economy is bust, their economy is no good, and I know people aren't so happy.\"The president also said he might back another round of Israeli air strikes on Iran if the country rebuilt its ballistic missile or nuclear programmes.During a 12-day war between Israel and Iran in June, the US carried out air strikes on key Iranian uranium enrichment sites. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful.President Pezeshkian vowed on Tuesday that Iran's response to \"any oppressive act of aggression\" would be \"severe and regret-inducing\".Iran's supreme leader has repeatedly said that Israel's government hoped mass protests would erupt in Iran during the war and topple the regime.\"They wanted to create sedition on the streets... But people were absolutely not influenced by what the enemy wanted,\" Khamenei said in September.",

    "body": "Thieves used a large drill to break into a safe at a high street bank branch in western Germany and steal an estimated €30m (£26m; $35m) in cash and valuables, police have said.A police spokesman likened the break-in to the Hollywood heist film Ocean's Eleven, telling AFP news agency it was \"very professionally executed\".During the heist at Sparkasse savings bank in the city of Gelsenkirchen, thieves broke open more than 3,000 safe deposit boxes containing money, gold and jewellery. Gelsenkirchen Police said they became aware of the crime after a fire alarm was set off in the early hours of Monday morning.Currently, no arrests have been made and the perpetrators remain at large.Police said the thieves had used the \"quiet Christmas days\" to rob the building on Nienhofstrasse in the Buer district.Initial investigations suggest they gained access to the bank, and escaped, via an adjacent parking garage.Witnesses have reported seeing several men carrying large bags in the staircase of the garage overnight on Saturday into Sunday. Police said video footage shows a black Audi RS 6 leaving the garage, on De-La-Chevallerie-Strasse, early on Monday morning.The hole into the underground vault room was discovered when a fire alarm went off in the early hours of Monday, and police and the fire brigade searched the building.Affected bank customers have been asked to contact Sparkasse bank, which has set up a hotline. Police secured the entrance of the branch on Tuesday after a large number of customers gathered outside demanding information.\"I couldn't sleep last night. We're getting no information,\" one man told the Welt broadcaster, according to Reuters, as he waited outside the branch, adding that it contained his savings for old age.A message on the bank's website said the branch would remain closed on Tuesday following the break-in.Sparkasse said 95% of customers' safe deposit boxes had been forced open by the thieves, so the likelihood they were affected is \"very high\". It added that the contents of each compartment are insured up to €10,300 and told customers to check if they had additional coverage through their home insurance.",

    "body": "6 minutes agoTom BennettReutersA passenger has described \"chaos\" after two trains collided head-on near Peru's most popular tourist attraction, Machu Picchu.Niels Honkoop, 33, told the BBC he had switched seats part-way through the journey from the middle of the train to the back, before it crashed, injuring many of those sitting near the front.\"I saw staff running around and people crying and people on the floor and chaos erupted,\" he said. \"We got off the train and I saw people bleeding with very severe injuries.\"A train driver was killed and at least 40 others were injured in the crash, which took place at around 13:20 local time (18:20 GMT) on Tuesday. Mr Honkoop said the table in front of him broke in two. Shattered glass littered the floor of the carriage, and many were lying wounded in the aisle. One woman he saw was trapped \"between a bench and a table\". He tried to assist by moving luggage and handing out painkillers, as, by coincidence, \"I'd had a wisdom tooth removed recently so I had lots of painkillers on me\".AFP via Getty ImagesThe UK Foreign Office said it was \"supporting a number of British nationals involved\" in the crash, while the US embassy in Peru said that US citizens were injured. After the crash, Mr Honkoop said another train arrived with medical assistance. He and his tour group were taken to a nearby village where they were given food and medical care and taken to a hotel. The collision occurred on the track linking Ollantaytambo Station and Aguas Calientes, the closest town to Machu Picchu. The journey between the two stations usually takes around 90 minutes.The two trains involved were operated by PeruRail and Inca Rail respectively.Watch: Injured passengers helped from train after collision near Machu Picchu\"We deeply regret what has happened,\" PeruRail said in a statement, adding that its staff had \"immediately\" provided first aid to the train driver, the train conductor and the passengers involved in the incident.The cause of the accident has not yet been made clear.It comes amid an ongoing dispute between providers of transport to the Unesco world heritage site, with local communities unhappy with what they say is an insufficiently open bidding process.The trains and buses that take tourists to the ancient town have steep ticket prices and can be highly lucrative for operators due to its limited accessibility.Built in the Peruvian Andes in the 15th Century, the Incan city of Machu Picchu is one of the Seven Modern Wonders of the World.Visitors can take a series of trains and buses to reach the site, or hike along the Inca trail with a registered tour operator.In 2011, officials implemented a daily cap on visitors to protect and preserve the site, but concerns remain about over-tourism.More on this story",

Whitlock, who also featured in Goodfellas and The Chappelle Show, was a longtime collaborator with director Spike Lee, who also shared a heartfelt tribute to him.\"Today I Learned Of The Passing Of My Dear Beloved Brother ISIAH WHITLOCK. GOD BLESS,\" Lee wrote, alongside a photo of the two men shaking hands.\"If you knew him - you loved him. A brilliant actor and even better person,\" Mr Liebman wrote.  \"May his memory forever be a blessing. Our hearts are so broken. He will be very, very missed.\"In statements to Hollywood news outlets, he added that Whitlock passed away in New York after a short illness.On The Wire, Whitlock played a corrupt politician, and was known for his profane catchphrase, which Whitlock himself had developed. His elongated version of the common swear word was inspired by his uncle, he said in a 2008 interview.He also used it in films he made before The Wire but it then became so popularised that it entered the lexicon.\"I was in, I think, Grand Central Station and far away I heard someone say it and they'd be kind of smiling,\" he said. \"I'm glad people enjoy it.\"On Veep, he played a comical version of the US secretary of defense, who runs for office against the main character, played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Whitlock featured in six films by Spike Lee, including 25th Hour, She Hate Me, Red Hook Summer, Chi-Raq , BlacKkKlansman and Da 5 Bloods.The native of South Bend, Indiana, also had roles in films Pieces of April, Enchanted and Cars 3 and Lightyear, as well as TV roles in the Law and Order franchise.",

    "body": "11 hours agoKelly NgandJonathan Head,South East Asia Correspondent, BangkokThailand has released 18 Cambodian soldiers that were captured in July during deadly border clashes as part of a ceasefire the two countries agreed to on Saturday.The handover was delayed by a day over Thai concerns over alleged violations of the ceasefire, but took place after sustained Chinese diplomatic pressure to ensure the deal holds.Simmering tensions along the Thailand-Cambodia border exploded early this month and went on for weeks, forcing nearly one million people from their homes.Saturday's deal had seen both sides agree to freeze the front lines where they are now, ban reinforcements, and allow civilians living in border areas to return as soon as possible. The 18 Cambodian soldiers, dressed in civilian clothes, were greeted by well-wishers as they were escorted over a border checkpoint and handed to the Cambodian authorities. Their captivity since July - during an earlier round of deadly clashes - has inflamed nationalist sentiment in Cambodia, their release being one of the main demands of its government in the ceasefire talks with Thailand.On Wednesday, Thailand's foreign ministry said the release of the soldiers was a \"demonstration of goodwill\" and that it hoped Cambodia would \"reciprocate this goodwill through its concrete actions\".Cambodia confirmed the return of its troops, with its defence ministry saying it \"remains hopeful\" that this will help build \"mutual trust and confidence\".One of the terms of the ceasefire was that the 18 soldiers had to be handed over within 72 hours - by noon local time on Tuesday. But this was delayed after Bangkok accused Phnom Penh of violating the truce by flying more than 250 unmanned aerial vehicles into Thailand on Sunday.Despite Thailand's complaints, the latest ceasefire appears to be holding so far.Disagreement over the border dates back more than a century, but tension increased early this year after a group of Cambodian women sang patriotic songs in a disputed temple.A Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash in May. Then in July, five days of intense fighting along the border left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead. Thousands more civilians were displaced.The two countries agreed to a fragile ceasefire in July and signed it in October, brokered by US President Donald Trump. But the ceasefire collapsed when fresh tensions erupted early this month, with both sides accusing the other over the breakdown.",

    "body": "Brazil's jailed former president, Jair Bolsonaro, has undergone a third medical procedure over four days to treat persistent hiccups. Doctors performed a third operation to block his phrenic nerve. The nerve is found in the neck and vital in controlling the diaphragm – which controls breathing.The former president's wife, Michelle Bolsonaro, shared a statement on social media confirming her husband underwent a third procedure because the hiccups \"had not stopped' since the weekend.The far-right leader is serving a 27-year sentence after plotting a coup to overturn the 2022 election.Bolsonaro's medical team said he would undergo further testing on Wednesday to determine where he had gastroesphageal reflux. This occurs when stomach acid flows back up into the throat and causes heartburn.The two hiccup operations on Saturday and Monday treated Bolsonaro's right and left phrenic nerves. Doctors said on Tuesday they did not \"believe the hospitalisation will be prolonged much longer\".His wife, Michelle, said the ex-president's surgeries follow \"nine months of struggle and anguish with daily hiccups\".Bolsonaro, 70, was originally admitted to hospital in the capital, Brasília, to undergo a successful double hernia surgery on Christmas Day. He was due to leave hospital on 1 January if his recovery went well. Brazil's Supreme Court allowed the jailed ex-president to be transferred from police headquarters where he is serving his sentence to hospital.Prior to his hernia surgery, the former president underwent intestinal surgery in April.Bolsonaro served as president of Brazil between 2019 and 2023. He lost the 2022 election to Brazil's current president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.A man stabbed Bolsonaro in his abdomen at a campaign rally one month before the 2018 election, requiring surgery due to extensive blood loss. The stabbing has led to ongoing health issues for the far-right figure.He endorsed his son Flávio Bolsonaro to run against Lula in the 2026 presidential election.",

    "body": "Jailed HK tycoon's 'teeth rotting and fingernails falling off', daughter tells BBC8 hours agoDanny VincentandKoh EweAFP via Getty ImagesJimmy Lai is seen here in a 2020 photo taken months before he went to jailThe daughter of Jimmy Lai, the pro-democracy tycoon jailed in Hong Kong, has expressed concerns about her father's deteriorating health in prison, saying that his fingernails \"sometimes fall off\" and his teeth are rotting.Lai, 78, has been detained since December 2020 and faces life in prison. Earlier this month he was convicted of colluding with foreign forces under the city's controversial national security law (NSL).Hong Kong and Chinese authorities have denied that Lai has been mistreated in prison, saying he is in \"good health\".The BBC has seen a letter written by Lai's family urging UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to call for Lai's release when he meets Chinese President Xi Jinping next month.His daughter Claire Lai, who is in exile in London, told the BBC that she fears she \"may never see him again\".\"Of course I worry that my father is going to be a martyr, and I don't want him to be a martyr. But I would not be here today, I would not be speaking out if I didn't think this was his best chance of reuniting with our family.\"She described her father as an \"extremely robust and strong man\" when he went to prison, but said over the last year he has \"lost a significant amount of weight\".\"He is diabetic, he has heart issues which he never had in the past. He has fingernails that turn purplish grey and sometimes fall off. He has teeth that are rotting.\"He has back and waist pains. Some days it's painful for him to stand. Sometimes he can't stand. And some days he can't even get out of bed.\"Lai's family has, on multiple occasions, flagged concerns about his deteriorating health. Lai's son, Sebastien, told the BBC earlier this year that his father's \"body is breaking down\".A spokesperson for the Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong stated earlier this month that Lai's \"lawful rights and interests have been fully protected, and he is in good health\".They added that \"a safe, humane, appropriate, and healthy custodial environment in accordance with the law\" has been provided for Lai.Claire Lai is on a campaign to get her father released from prisonLai, a UK citizen, is the most prominent person to be charged under the NSL, introduced in 2020 in response to massive pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.Beijing defends the law as necessary to maintain stability in Hong Kong, but critics say it has effectively outlawed dissent.Lai was accused of lobbying foreign governments to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China. He was also found guilty under a separate colonial-era law of publishing seditious material in his now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper.After Lai's conviction earlier this month, the UK condemned it as \"politically motivated persecution\", saying that he had been \"targeted... for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression\".\"The UK has repeatedly called for the National Security Law to be repealed and for an end to the prosecution of all individuals charged under it,\" the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said.In their statement earlier this month, Chinese authorities said Western attempts \"to influence judicial verdicts through political pressure blatantly trample on the spirit of the rule of law and fully expose their hypocritical 'double standards'. The Chinese side firmly opposes this.\"Starmer's trip to China in late January 2026 will be the first by a UK Prime Minister since 2018.",

    "body": "Mali and Burkina Faso say they will bar US citizens from entering their countries in response to a similar move by the Trump administration.The two West African states were recently placed under full entry restrictions under US President Donald Trump's expanded travel ban.In separate statements, they said they would apply the same measures on US nationals. Burkina Faso's foreign affairs minister Karamoko Jean-Marie Traoré said his government was acting on the \"principle of reciprocity\", while Mali's foreign ministry called for \"mutual respect and sovereign equality\". The latter said it regretted the US's move, adding that \"such an important decision was made without any prior consultation\". Mali and Burkina Faso's decision comes days after Niger's state news agency reported that Niger had imposed a similar travel ban on US citizens, though no official statement has been issued by its foreign ministry to confirm this.  The three countries are ruled by military juntas which seized power in coups. They have formed their own regional bloc, and have pivoted towards Russia after relations with other West African states and Western powers became strained.Earlier this month, the White House said that full-entry restrictions would be imposed on people from the three countries, as well as South Sudan, Syria and Palestinian Authority passport holders. The decision would come into effect on 1 January,  and was intended to \"protect the security\" of the US, it said.The administration also moved Laos and Sierra Leone, which were previously subject to partial restrictions, to the full ban list, and put partial restrictions on 15 other countries, including Nigeria, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.The White House said the restrictions would remain in place until affected countries show \"credible improvements\" in identity management, information-sharing and cooperation with US immigration authorities.A number of exceptions apply and the ban will not affect lawful permanent residents, many existing visa holders, diplomats, or athletes travelling for major sporting events. Officials said case-by-case waivers would also be available where travel is deemed to be in the national interest.",

    "body": "6 hours agoKelly Ng,Shahnewaz Rocky,BBC Bangla, DhakaandAnbarasan Ethirajan,BBC World Service Global Reporter, LondonAFP via Getty ImagesHundreds of thousands of people gathered as a motorcade carrying Khaleda Zia's body drove through DhakaHundreds of thousands of people travelled from across Bangladesh to the capital Dhaka on Wednesday to pay their final respects to former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia.Zia, who was the country's first female prime minister, died on Tuesday from a prolonged illness. She was 80.The mourners held out their hands in prayer and carried flags printed with her photographs as a motorcade carrying Zia's body - including the hearse wrapped with the national flag - drove on streets near the parliament house.Flags were flown at half-mast and thousands of security officers were deployed.\"I have come this far just to say goodbye. I know I won't be able to see her face, but at least I could see the [vehicle] carrying her for the last rites,\" Setara Sultana, an activist from Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), told the BBC.Sharmina Siraj, a mother of two, called Zia \"an inspiration\", noting that stipends introduced by the former leader to improve women's education made a \"huge impact\" on her daughters.\"It is difficult to imagine women in leadership positions anytime soon,\" she told AFP news agency.India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, the Speaker of Pakistan's National Assembly Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and Bhutan's Foreign Minister Lyonpo DN Dhungyel were among those who attended the funeral.Earlier in the day, Zia's body was taken to the house of her son Tarique Rahman, who was seen reciting the Quran beside his mother's office.The state funeral marks the end of Zia's extraordinary journey, from a homemaker to the first female prime minister of Bangladesh.BBC BanglaMourners have travelled from around the country to attend Khaleda Zia's funeralZia was be buried next to her husband Ziaur Rahman, who was assassinated in 1981  while serving as president - an incident that thrusted Zia into the political limelight.She went on to lead the BNP in the country's first elections in 20 years. She was dubbed an \"uncompromising leader\" after refusing to participate in a controversial election under military ruler General Hussain Muhammad Ershad in the 1980s.For several years, along with her bitter political rival Sheikh Hasina, she fought for democracy and against military dictatorship, enduring arrests.  There was talk among Bangladesh's rulers at the time to keep the two \"battling begums\" - Zia and Hasina - out of politics in what was then known as the \"minus two formula\". But Zia eventually became prime minister, first in 1991 then again in 2001. During the time of the military-backed caretaker government in 2007, she was kept under detention.In the last 16 years, under Hasnina's Awami League government, Zia emerged as the most prominent symbol of resistance to Hasina's rule which many saw as increasingly autocratic.Zia's resilience drew admiration from her supporters, who say that despite various personal and political setbacks, years in opposition and convictions under Hasina's government, Zia never gave up, refused to compromise on her principles and stood her ground.  The fact that hundreds of thousands of people, including those who didn't vote for her party, turned up for the funeral would be seen as a reflection of her popularity among the masses. Those who worked with her recall a leader who asked probing questions while making key decisions. As economist Dr Debapriya Bhattacharya noted, she left a lasting impression as  \"a political leader who appreciated ideas and valued informed decision-making\".In her later years, she suffered from multiple health problems. Despite this, the BNP said she had intended to run for parliament in February 2026, when the country will vote for the first time since a popular revolution last year unseated Hasina.According to the party's candidate list released earlier this month, Zia was to contest in three constituencies. The party is eyeing a return to power, and if that happens, her son is expected to become the country's new leader. Rahman, 60, had only returned to Bangladesh last week after 17 years in self-imposed exile in London.\"The country mourns the loss of a guiding presence that shaped its democratic aspirations,\" Rahman said following his mother's passing on Tuesday.Reuters",

We want people to be safe in our community,\" he added.British tourists Joe and Lucy said the increased police presence reassured them. The pair - who timed their Australia trip to coincide with the fireworks - were in Melbourne when the shooting occurred.\"We had our worries about coming for New Year's Eve,\" Joe told the BBC, adding, \"but we were reading more recently in the news... how more police were going to be here, it would be a bit safer\".Separately, Minns had urged Sydneysiders to not let the \"horrible criminal terrorist event\" at Bondi change the way they live, as he called on people to \"show defiance\" and celebrate the new year.This sentiment was shared by some of the spectators.Out among the crowds at Barangaroo's Observatory Hill, a close spot to the Sydney Harbour Bridge, was Hélène from Belgium.She told the BBC people \"cannot live in fear\" following the attack.Hours ahead of the countdown, hundreds of thousands of people flocked towards the harbour, with many official viewing areas filling to capacity by early evening.On the harbour, sailboats dotted the water - one of the best spots to watch the midnight fireworks display.Sydney's celebration - with its iconic fireworks display - kicked off a chain of events, from Dubai, to London and New York.Getty ImagesArmed police carrying assault rifles patrol outside the Sydney Opera HouseAdditional reporting by Harry Sekulich",

    "body": "7 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterSkyHeated Rivalry has been a huge hit internationally, and is due to launch in the UK in JanuaryThe author of Heated Rivalry has revealed the success of the TV adaptation has resulted in her receiving specialist help with her Parkinson's disease.Rachel Reid, 45, was diagnosed with the condition in the summer of 2023, around the same time she was approached about adapting her book series for the screen.Heated Rivalry, which centres on an illicit same-sex relationship between two ice hockey players, has become one of the most talked-about new TV shows of recent weeks.In an interview with Variety, the Canadian author explained that a Parkinson's expert contacted her after hearing about her diagnosis in a publicity interview for the series.The subsequent appointment she has secured with a neurologist, Reid said, \"could change things for me, because I'm not really getting the treatment that I should be getting\".Reid published her first book in the Game Changers series in 2018. Five further books followed, and the TV version soon created a stir after launching in North America in late November. The show, which is adapted and directed by Jacob Tierney, is set to launch in the UK on 10 January on Sky and streaming service Now.Getty ImagesRachel Reid published her first instalment of her six-book Game Changers series in 2018Speaking to Variety, Reid said an \"amazing thing\" had come out of the attention the show has received.\"Jacob was on CNN a few weeks ago. For whatever reason, the interviewer asked him about my Parkinson's diagnosis,\" she recalled.\"I thought it was kind of odd, but then the next day, one of the top Parkinson's experts in the world reached out to me and asked if he could help me.\"Reid explained: \"I've never gotten to talk to a Parkinson's expert. I've been on a five-year waiting list here because I live in a very small place.\"Now he's found me a Parkinson's expert, a neurologist, and I have an appointment in a couple weeks. \"That could change things for me because I'm not really getting the treatment that I should be getting.\"He also told me how to change my medication so I can sleep because I never slept. That change made me sleep through the night, which really helps with writing.\"Reid said her Parkinson's made it hard for her to write \"because I can barely control a mouse\".\"I can't type for very long,\" she continued. \"It's hard for me to sit in a chair for very long. I need to figure out new ways to write.\"I don't know if that will be voice-to-text. I don't know if I can write that way. It doesn't feel natural, but I need to figure out something because it is taking me a very long time to write now.\"Heated Rivalry follows rival hockey players Shane and Ilya, played by Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie.The pair are bound by rivalry and ambition, but begin a secret affair which evolves into a years-long relationship.What is Parkinson's disease?Parkinson's is a progressive condition that worsens over time.Those with the disease have too little of the chemical dopamine in their brain because some of the nerve cells that make it have stopped working.Symptoms include:involuntary shaking of parts of the bodyslow movementstiff and inflexible musclesSource: Parkinson's UK",

    "body": "11 hours agoSebastian UsherJerusalemJerusalem: Footage shows scale of ultra-Orthodox protest against conscriptionHundreds of thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jewish Israelis are taking part in a protest in Jerusalem against changes to a legal exemption for religious students from conscription in the military.Almost all sects and factions of the ultra-Orthodox, or Haredi, community are taking part in what has been dubbed the \"march of the million\".Since the founding of Israel, students enrolled full-time at a religious school, or yeshiva, have been exempted from conscription, although some other members of the community do serve in the military.Demands for them to play a bigger role have intensified during the war in Gaza.Roads in and around Jerusalem were shut down before the start of one of the biggest anti-conscription protests by ultra-Orthodox Israelis in years.It is bringing together disparate elements of the community, which makes up about 14% of the Israeli population.What is uniting them is their opposition not only to moves to enforce conscription for more of their community, but also anger at hundreds of arrests in recent months of ultra-Orthodox men avoiding the draft.The Haredi believe that their age-old way of life could be under threat.But many in Israel feel they have not shared their fair burden in the war.Bringing them into the military would help with a shortfall in manpower.But there are also concerns in the military about conscripting large numbers of ultra-Orthodox - integration would be a difficult challenge, as well as accommodating the Haredi need to adhere to the strict code of their religious beliefs.",

    "body": "Five people have been charged in connection with the 2023 overdose death of Robert De Niro's grandson and two other 19 year olds. New York authorities accuse the suspects, Bruce Epperson, Eddie Barreto, Grant McIver, John Nicolas, and Roy Nicolas, of running a fentanyl distribution network that sold counterfeit prescription opioid pills through social media to teenagers and young adults in the city. Authorities link the network to the overdose deaths of Leandro De Niro-Rodriguez,  Akira Stein - daughter of Blondie co-founder Chris Stein - and a third unnamed victim.The five are each charged with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute.\"Through their alleged actions, these defendants left behind a trail of irreversible loss that cut short the lives of three teenagers who held boundless potential and who had already made profound, immeasurable impacts on those who knew them,\" said Homeland Security Investigations New York special agent in charge Ricky Patel in a statement on Thursday. Prosecutors allege the five used social media and encrypted messaging apps to sell thousands fentanyl-laced pills in New York between January and July 2023.They allege that over that summer, the drugs they sold led to at least three deaths. Stein was found dead 30 May after taking fentanyl-laced pills she allegedly  purchased from John and Roy Nicolas. The unnamed victim, who died 13 June, allegedly purchased pills through an intermediary from Mr McIver.Authorities say De Niro-Rodriguez, who died 2 July, got pills from a dealer who allegedly obtained them from Mr McIver, Mr Epperson, and Mr Barreto.Separatedly in 2023, a woman was arrested for allegedly selling De Niro-Rodriguez three counterfeit oxycodone pills containing fentanyl - the drugs believed to have led to his death - and tablets of Xanax.In a statement after the death of his grandson, Academy-Award winner De Niro said he was \"deeply distressed\" by the passing of his \"beloved grandson\", who was the only child of his daughter Drena.In a statement on Instagram on Thursday, Chris Stein noted the arrests in his daughter's case and thanked officials \"for this hope of some justice for her\".If found guilty, the charges carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life in prison, officials said.

    "body": "K-pop group NewJeans has lost a legal battle to leave its record label Ador.A South Korean court on Tuesday ruled that the act's contract with the label, which runs until 2029, remains valid.The group's five members - Hanni, Hyein, Haerin, Danielle and Minji - announced last year that they were unilaterally leaving the agency, citing mistreatment and manipulation.The group has said it will appeal the ruling, according to local media reports.NewJeans said it is \"impossible to return to Ador\" and continue their activities as normal, the reports said.The Seoul Central Disctrict Court rejected NewJeans' argument that the dismissal of former Ador CEO Min Hee-jin, who was also the group's mentor, constituted a breach of contract. NewJeans alleged that her dismissal broke their trust with the agency.In a statement released after the ruling, Ador said it sincerely hopes that the judgment \"will serve as an opportunity for the artists to calmly reflect on this matter\". The label added that the it is ready for the members' upcoming activities, including the release of an album, and is now \"waiting\".The case stunned South Korea where record labels wield large amounts of power and tightly control their stars. It is highly unusual for artists to rebel against them. Formed in July 2022, NewJeans, whose members are aged from 17 to 21, had enjoyed rapid success before their dramatic fallout with the agency.Their first single Attention topped Korean charts right after their debut, while their hit song SuperShy made multiple \"best of the year\" lists at the end of 2023, including those compiled by Rolling Stone, NME and Billboard Magazine.Critics had called them a \"game-changer\" as their blend of 1990s R&B and sugar-coated pop melodies broke through a K-pop scene dominated by electronic beats. Tuesday's ruling follows a year-long standoff between the chart-topping group and its agency.The group's announcement to split from Ador, which was made in November last year during a press conference, came after a long and public spat between Min Hee-jin, and Ador, as well as its parent company, Hybe - South Korea's biggest music label, whose client list includes K-pop royalty such as BTS and Seventeen.Tensions between Min and Hybe started in April 2024, when Hybe launched audits into Ador, which was then managed by Min, while calling her to step down.Min rejected Hybe's allegations that she was plotting to go independent. In August, she was dismissed as the CEO of Ador.The band soon issued an ultimatum demanding that Min be reinstated. When Hybe refused, the members went public with a series of complaints against the label, including claims it had deliberately undermined their careers.One of the group's members, Hanni, also alleged that she suffered workplace harassment while working with the label.In December, Ador filed a lawsuit asking the court to confirm the validity of their contract with the group.As the disputes continued, the group's five members attemped to rebrand themselves as NJZ in February. They planned to release a new song, but the promotions were halted by a court order.The group still performed it at a show in Hong Kong, where they announced a hiatus.Back in March, after the court injunction was issued, the group described the court's decision as \"a shock\", but said the five of them would \"go through it\" together.",

    "body": "3 hours agoDanielle KayeBusiness reporterReutersApple boss Tim Cook holds an iPhone 17 pro and an iPhone Air, as Apple holds an event at the Steve Jobs Theater on its campus in Cupertino, California, US September 9, 2025.The latest iPhones have seen \"a tremendous response\" across the globe, said Apple boss Tim Cook as the tech giant released its latest financial results.The firm unveiled its thinnest iPhone, the Air, in September, along with upgraded iPhone 17 models, proving a bumper crop for the firm.It said it expects the upcoming Christmas and New Year's period to be a blockbuster, forecasting overall revenue to be up to 12% higher than the same period last year.But Apple narrowly missed estimates for iPhone sales in its fourth quarter that ended in September, which boss Tim Cook blamed on supply constraints for several iPhone models along with a lag in shipments to China.Despite that, during a call with analysts Mr Cook said Apple is heading into the holiday season \"with our most powerful lineup ever\".The iPhone Air helped entice customers and boost sales.If the company meets its sales forecast for the holiday season, it would be Apple's \"best quarter ever\", chief financial officer Kevan Parekh told analysts on Thursday.Apple reported overall fourth quarter revenue of $102.5bn (£77bn), topping analysts' estimates and representing an 8% increase from the previous year. But iPhone revenue, specifically, came in slightly below expectations at $49bn (£37bn).Mr Cook stressed that global demand for iPhone 16 and 17 models has been robust, despite constraints that led to the sales miss in the recent quarter. \"We're not predicting when the supply and demand will balance,\" Mr Cook said. \"We're obviously working very hard to achieve that, because we want to get as many of these products out to customers as possible.\"In the Chinese market, he said he \"couldn't be more pleased with how things are going\", citing strong reception to the new iPhone 17.Data from Counterpoint, a technology market research firm, showed that the first 10 days of iPhone 17 sales in the US and China were up 14% compared with sales of the iPhone 16.The effects of US President Donald Trump's tariffs also remain top of mind for Apple's investors. It manufactures many iPhones in China and its global supply chain leaves it vulnerable to trade wars - though a recent meeting between Trump and President Xi raised hopes for a de-escalation of tensions.Mr Cook on Thursday told analysts that the company took at $1.1bn (£836m) hit from tariffs in the recently ended quarter. He said the hit will likely amount to another $1.4bn in the holiday quarter as Trump imposes taxes on those whom he sees as \"unfavourable\" to the US economy.Amazon, which also reported quarterly results on Thursday, projected sales to land between $206bn (£156bn) and $213bn (£161bn) for the current quarter through December, largely in line with analysts' expectations.\"We're encouraged by the start of the peak season,\" Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, told analysts.Amazon also said that revenue from Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing business, rose 20% in the third quarter from the previous year - its fastest pace since 2022.For investors, that AI-driven growth could come as a reassurance, as Apple faces fierce competition in the race to dominate the AI boom.Apple's stock has lagged behind that of rivals Microsoft and Alphabet, both of whom on Wednesday reaffirmed their commitment to spending big on the technology. Those firms have reported even faster growth than Amazon in their cloud computing businesses.\"We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure, and we've been focused on accelerating capacity,\" Andy Jassy, Amazon's chief executive, said in a statement.",

    "body": "13 hours agoKathryn ArmstrongReutersPrecious crown jewels were taken during the theft earlier this monthFive more suspects have been arrested over their involvement in the Louvre heist, Paris' public prosecutor has said.They were detained on Wednesday night in the Paris region during coordinated raids, according to Laure Beccuau. One of the suspects is thought to be part of the four-man team that carried out the heist, who were seen on CCTV. Two of the other alleged thieves have already been arrested and have \"partially recognised\" their involvement in the brazen theft, while the fourth person has not yet been caught. It is not clear what role the other newly arrested people allegedly played in the theft, but Beccuau told French radio station RTL on Thursday that they \"may eventually inform us about how the incident took place\".Beccuau said the arrests had been made in areas in and around Paris, including the  suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis.Phones and other objects found on the suspects during the raid were allowing investigators to study encrypted messages, she added.Those arrested can be detained for up to four days before being charged or released.How Louvre gang carried out France's most shocking theftFrench investigators are not giving many more details away at this stage but Beccuau said that DNA from one of those arrested on Wednesday night could be linked to the crime scene. \"We had him in our sights,\" she said of the main suspect. She specified that the latest arrests were not related to statements made by the previously detained suspects but to \"other elements of the case\".The authorities have previously said that the gang involved in the heist could be bigger than those who physically stole the jewels.Items worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the Louvre - the world's most-visited museum - on 19 October, when four thieves broke into the building in broad daylight. The precious jewels have not been recovered yet.Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen A tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenThe first two people who were arrested over the heist - both men in their thirties with criminal records - are thought to be the pair who used power tools to enter the museum's  Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) and steal some of the French crown jewels.They were taken into custody late last week. Beccuau told a press conference on Wednesday that one of the men was arrested as he tried to board a one-way flight to Algeria, but that the other man had not been planning to leave France, contrary to earlier media reports.There was no evidence at this stage to suggest the theft was an inside job, she added, confirming no accomplices worked at the museum. On the day of the heist, the robbers arrived at 09:30, just after the museum opened to visitors, Beccuau said at a press conference on Wednesday.The suspects arrived with a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Gallery of Apollo via a balcony close to the River Seine. The men used a disc cutter to crack open display cases housing the jewellery.Beccuau said the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38, before switching to cars and heading east. Nobody had been threatened during the raid. France's justice minister said security protocols in the Louvre - one of the world's most famous museums - \"failed\" in preventing the theft. It was later revealed by the Louvre's director that the only camera monitoring the Gallery of Apollo was pointing away from a balcony the thieves climbed over to break in. Since the incident, security measures have been tightened around France's cultural institutions.The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following the heist. They will now be stored in the Bank's most secure vault, 26m (85ft) below the ground floor of its elegant headquarters in central Paris.Watch: Two people leave Louvre in lift mounted to vehicle",

    "body": "Trump caps refugee admissions at record low - with most to be white South Africans6 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseGetty ImagesTrump criticised South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in May and claimed white farmers in his nation were being killed and \"persecuted\"The Trump administration will limit the number of refugees admitted to the US to 7,500 over the next year, and give priority to white South Africans.The move, announced in a notice published on Thursday, marks a dramatic cut from the previous limit of 125,000 set by former President Joe Biden and will bring the cap to a record low.No reason was given for the cut, but the notice said it was \"justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest\".In January, Trump signed an executive order suspending the US Refugee Admissions Programme, or USRAP, which he said would allow US authorities to prioritise national security and public safety. The previous lowest refugee admissions cap was set by the first Trump administration in 2020, when it allocated 15,000 spots for fiscal year 2021.The notice posted to the website of the Federal Register said the 7,500 admissions would \"primarily\" be allocated to Afrikaner South Africans and \"other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands\".In February, the US president announced the suspension of critical aid to South Africa and offered to allow members of the Afrikaner community - who are mostly white descendants of early Dutch and French settlers - to settle in the US as refugees.South Africa's ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool, was later expelled after accusing Trump of \"mobilising a supremacism\" and trying to \"project white victimhood as a dog whistle\".In the Oval Office in May, Trump confronted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa and claimed white farmers in his nation were being killed and \"persecuted\".The White House also played a video which they said showed burial sites for murdered white farmers. It later emerged that the videos were scenes from a 2020 protest in which the crosses represented farmers killed over multiple years. The tense meeting came just days after the US granted asylum to 60 Afrikaners.The South African government has vehemently denied that Afrikaners and other White South Africans are being persecuted.Watch: 'Turn the lights down' - how the Trump-Ramaphosa meeting took an unexpected turnOn his first day in office on 20 January, Trump said the US would suspend USRAP to reflect the US's lack of \"ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans\" and \"protects their safety and security\".The US policy of accepting white South Africans has already prompted accusations of unfair treatment from refugee advocacy groups. Do Afrikaners want to take Trump up on his South African refugee offer?'I didn't come here for fun' - Afrikaner defends refugee status in USIs there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?Some have argued the US is now effectively shut to other persecuted groups or people facing potential harm in their home country, and even former allies that helped US forces in Afghanistan or the Middle East. \"This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling,\" Global Refuge CEO and president Krish O'Mara Vignarajah said on Thursday. \"It lowers our moral standing.\" \"At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the programme's purpose as well as its credibility,\" she added. The South African government has yet to respond to the latest announcement. During the Oval Office meeting, President Ramaphosa said only that he hoped that Trump officials would listen to South Africans about the issue, and later said he believed there is \"doubt and disbelief about all this in [Trump's] head\".Earlier this year, Ramaphosa signed a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately-owned land without compensation in some circumstances. While the country does not release race-based crime figured, figures published earlier this year showed that 7,000 people were murdered in South African between October and December 2024. Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks and only one of the 12 was a farmer. Five others were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black. ",

    "body": "'Can't go back' - families in violence-hit Indian state fear resettlement deadline31 minutes agoJugal PurohitBBC HindiMidhat Ullah HasaniChingakham Radha has moved to a temporary shelter but longs to return home Thousands of people displaced by ethnic clashes in India's north-eastern state of Manipur two years ago now face an uncertain future, as the government plans to shut down all temporary relief camps by December.The violence, which erupted in May 2023 between the majority Meitei and the indigenous Kuki communities, was the worst the region had witnessed in decades.It started after protests by the largely Christian Kuki community against the Meiteis, mostly Hindus, who were demanding official tribal status that would grant them access to the same government benefits and job quotas as other tribes, including Kukis.At least 260 people were killed in the clashes and around 60,000 displaced people have since been living in temporary shelters.Over the past two years, the government has made repeated promises to rehabilitate the displaced, but little has changed on the ground. Many say their lives remain in a limbo - effectively homeless and without a steady source of income.Anxieties grew further in July when the state's then Chief Secretary Prashant Singh announced that all relief camps would be shut down by December and its residents would be resettled.He added that those unable to return to their homes would be relocated to pre-fabricated housing units. The government, however, did not clarify where these units would be - whether near the relief camps or near displaced people's original homes  - worsening their concerns about future. Uncertainty grew in September when Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his first visit to Manipur since the violence began, announced that 7,000 new homes would be built to resettle the displaced in \"appropriate locations\" without giving any other details. Midhat Ullah HasaniThousands are still living in relief camps in the hilly Churachandpur regionOn the ground, Manipur remains sharply divided: the Meiteis inhabit the Imphal Valley, while the Kukis live in the surrounding hill districts; and security forces continue to patrol the buffer zones that separate the two communities.A security official deployed in the area told BBC Hindi that his mandate was to \"ensure that Meiteis and Kukis remain in their respective areas and do not mix\".Experts say resettling people in their original neighbourhoods is crucial to prevent the violence from redrawing Manipur's social map.\"This is not good for a secular, democratic India. Resettling them in their original homes is most critical,\" said RK Nimai Singh, former secretary to the Manipur governor.He added that many displaced people feared that if they left the relief camps and moved into temporary housing, they might never be able to return to their homes. It's a thought that haunts Hatnu Haokip. For her, home means only one place - Imphal valley - and she yearns to go back. \"But that can't happen because our village is now surrounded by Meitei people,\" said the 22-year-old who is now living in a relief camp in the hilly Churachandpur regionMs Haokip added that she would feel safer if Kuki leaders were given autonomy to set up a separate federally-administered territory for the community. This sentiment was echoed by several other Kukis, who also feel apprehensive of returning to their homes. On the other hand, most Meiteis BBC Hindi spoke to said they wanted to go back home. Irom Abung, who once ran a water supply business in Churachandpur, now lives in a relief camp near a buffer zone.His house was damaged during the violence, but Mr Abung says he will never give up on the place he once called home.\"My land remains. I will never sell it because I know I will return one day,\" he said. \"Efforts must be made to bridge the gap between our two communities so people can go back to their lives.\"The unease, coupled with uncertainty over where the new homes will be built, has raised doubts over whether the government would be able to close all relief camps by December.Government officials, however, insist that the resettlement plan is on track.\"From about 290 camps initially, we've brought the number down to around 260,\" a senior Manipur government official said.\"Eventually, we want to resettle people in the areas from where they fled, once they feel safe to return.\"The official added that while they understood people's concerns, it was also in the state's interest for them to return home - otherwise, the divisions would only grow deeper.Midhat Ullah HasaniMany women in the relief camps are crocheting and selling dolls to earn a little extra income to support their familiesAs tens of thousands of people continue to live in relief camps, many complain about not getting the facilities the government promised them.Nemhoichong Lhungdim, a single mother, said her 11-year-old son had suffered a debilitating eye injury a few months back and has lost sight in one eye.After government doctors failed to help, she borrowed money to take him to a private hospital, but was unable to afford the treatment.\"I was told it would cost about 300,000 rupees ($3,400; £2,600). I don't have that kind of money,\" she said.Ms Lhungdim says the government sometimes organises health camps, but they have never treated her son. BBC Hindi has reached out to officials for a response.Inside the camps, residents say prolonged displacement and uncertainty are also taking a toll on people's mental health.Salam Monika, 25, says her uncle took his own life last year after being driven to despair by a lack of livelihood opportunities. She says the family could not access medical help.\"Some mental health workers visited our camp a few times since 2023, but this year, they haven't come at all,\" she said.BBC Hindi has reached out to the government for comment.Meanwhile, those moved from camps into temporary housing say that while they now have a roof over their heads, they still struggle to make ends meet as livelihood remains a concern.Chingakham Radha, one of the newly resettled residents, said she learned to make crochet dolls while living in the camp and now earns a small income from selling them. \"The money is very little, just enough to get by,\" she said.Before the conflict, Ms Radha was a homemaker and her husband worked as a labourer. They were not wealthy, but had a happy life.Thinking about those days, Ms Radha says life has become uncertain now. \"Some days my husband finds work, but other times weeks go by without any work,\" she said. \"I want to return home to Churachandpur, but those hopes are fading with time.\"Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "9 hours agoAna FaguyGetty ImagesThe US government shutdown has entered its fifth week and there is no clear end in sight.With Democrats and Republicans deadlocked over passing a spending plan that would reopen federal agencies, millions of Americans are feeling economic pain that could soon grow worse.The fiscal fight means millions of Americans may not receive food aid, thousands of troops could have to work without pay, and millions may go without heat.Here’s how the shutdown has affected everyday people.Food assistanceMore than 40 million Americans use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) to feed themselves and their families.While that programme had enough funding to survive the first four weeks of the shutdown, the Trump administration has said the money will run out on 1 November. By Saturday, Snap benefits, also called food stamps, could lapse for the first time in the programme's history.Snap is a critical lifeline that keeps families out of poverty, Hannah Garth, a Princeton University professor who studies food insecurity, told the BBC. Groups that provide food for people in need are already under strain and the loss of Snap will make the situation worse, she added.On Thursday, New York Governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency so the state could “help the three million New Yorkers losing food assistance” because of the shutdown. People enrolled in Snap have been stockpiling food and visiting aid organisations, as they wait for the impasse to lift on Capitol Hill.Half the states and the District of Columbia have sued President Donald Trump's administration over the food aid freeze.  The administration, in turn, has blamed Democrats for the funding running dry and said it will only draw from a Snap contingency fund in an emergency such as a natural disaster.The federal government distributes Snap benefits through programmes run by the states. Some states, such as Virginia, have said they will be able to make up for any lack of funds in November, but others like Massachusetts have said they can't cover the shortfall.Military payIf the Trump administration does not intervene, more than a million members of the US military will miss their paycheques on Friday. About a quarter of military families are considered food insecure, and 15% rely on Snap or food pantries, according to the research firm Rand. Meanwhile, the Military Family Advisory Network estimates that 27% of families have $500 (£380) or less in emergency savings.The Pentagon says it has accepted a $130m gift from a wealthy donor to help pay  salaries during the shutdown, but that only works out to $100 for each of the 1.3 million active-duty service members expecting to be paid.The White House plans to pay the troops on 31 October by using money from a military housing fund, a research-and-development account, and a defence procurement fund, according to Axios, a political news outlet.Earlier this month, the administration made payroll by moving $6.5bn from military research.More than 160 families told the National Military Family Association, an advocacy group, that they have been underpaid during the shutdown, some by hundreds of dollars and others by thousands.Heat amid the winter chillAround six million Americans use a federal assistance initiative called the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (Liheap) for help paying utility bills.The government usually sends Liheap funds directly to utility companies in mid-November.The temperature is already dropping in northern areas, where Americans heat their homes with propane, electric and natural gas. Many states bar natural gas and electric companies from cutting off service to people who do not pay their bills, but those rules do not apply to propane or heating oil. Experts say thousands could face deadly conditions unless the government reopens or the government finds another resolution, such as a nationwide moratorium on cutting off heat in the shutdown.Watch: \"It’s been difficult\" - Government workers resort to food banksFederal civilian workersThousands of Americans work for the federal government as civilian employees and many of those folks will miss a paycheque this week. It has been a slow burn for many, with the side effects of the shutdown getting worse. Some civilian employees were able to get a week or two of compensation, while others have not seen a dollar since 1 October. Among those going without pay beginning this week are congressional aides on Capitol Hill. Food banks and food pantries across the US have already said they have seen an increase in the number of federal workers asking for help - particularly in Washington, DC.If the shutdown continues until 1 December, some 4.5 million paycheques will be withheld from federal civilian employees, making for about $21bn in missing wages, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Furloughed employees are typically paid after shutdowns end, although Trump has threatened to withhold pay and is currently trying to fire thousands of workers, which is being challenged in court.Air traffic controllersThousands of air traffic controllers missed their first paycheques this week. Because they are considered essential workers, they must continue to do their jobs without pay during the shutdown.  Since 1 October, numerous controllers have called in sick and now many report they are getting second jobs.In turn, thousands of US flyers have faced widespread delays. “The problems are mounting daily,” Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said at a press conference this week.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has said many of the flight delays in recent days and weeks have been the result of absence by air traffic controllers. Duffy has warned controllers could be fired if they fail to show up for work.",

    "body": "13 hours agoLaura BickerChina correspondent Watch: US and China's different reports of their trade meetingUS President Donald Trump came away from his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping full of bombastic optimism. He called it a \"great success\" and rated it 12, on a scale of 1 to 10. China was less enthusiastic. Beijing's initial statement sounds like an instruction manual, with Xi urging teams on both sides to \"follow up as soon as possible\".Trump is after a deal that could happen \"pretty soon\", while Beijing, it appears, wants to keep talking because it's playing the long game.  There was a more detailed second Chinese statement that echoed what Trump had said on board Air Force One.Among other things, the US would lower tariffs on Chinese imports, and China would suspend controls on the export of rare earths - critical minerals without which you cannot make smartphones, electric cars and, perhaps more crucially, military equipment.There is no deal yet, and negotiators on both sides have already been talking for months to iron out the details. But Thursday's agreement is still a breakthrough. It steadies what has become a rocky relationship between the world's two biggest economies and it assures global markets. But it is only a temporary truce. It doesn't solve the differences at the heart of such a competitive relationship. \"The US and China are going in different directions,\" says Kelly Ann Shaw, who was an economic adviser to Trump in his first term.\"It's really about managing the breakup in a way that does a limited amount of damage, that preserves US interests, and I think from China's perspective, preserves their own interests. But this is not a relationship that is necessarily going to improve dramatically anytime soon.\"'Struggle, but don't break'There is an art to doing a deal with Trump.It involves flattery - and most countries have tried it, including on his trip to Asia so far. South Korea gave him an enormous golden crown, while Japan's prime minister  nominated him for a Nobel Peace prize.But the Chinese leader offered only a meeting at a South Korean air base, where he and Trump would cross paths - as one flew in to the country, and the other departed.  It didn't feel out of step with China's guarded but defiant response from the start of Trump's trade war. Just days after the American president increased tariffs on Chinese goods, Beijing retaliated with its own levies.Chinese officials told the world that there would be no winners in a trade war. Like Trump, Xi too believed he had the upper hand - and he seemed to have a plan. He decided to use the country's economic weight - as the world's factory, as a massive market for its goods - to push back. Unlike Trump, he does not need to worry about elections or a worried vote base. That doesn't mean that Xi faces no pressures - he certainly does. He needs China's economy to grow, and create jobs and wealth so the Chinese Communist Party's power is not challenged by instability or discontent. Getty ImagesAnd yet, despite the country's current challenges - a real estate crisis, high youth unemployment and weak consumer spending - China has shown it is willing to absorb the pain of Trump's tariffs. Beijing would \"fight until the bitter end\" was the message from various ministries.  \"China's main principle is struggle, but don't break,\" says Keyu Jin, author of The New China Playbook.\"And it has escalated to de-escalate, which is a very new tactic.\"Xi had a planThat is, China hit Trump where it hurt. For the first time, it limited exports of rare earths to the US - and China processes around 90% of the world's rare earth metals.\"The nuance often missed in the rare earths debate is that China has an overwhelming position over the most strategic bit of the rare earth supply chain -  the heavy rare earths used in advanced defence systems,\" says Jason Bedford, macroeconomics expert and investment analyst. \"That advantage is far harder to dislodge than other parts of the rare earths industry.\" So getting China to relax those export controls became a priority for Washington - and that was a key bit of leverage for Xi when he sat down with Trump.China had also stopped buying US soybeans, which was aimed at farmers in Republican states - Trump's base. Reports this week say Beijing has already started buying soybeans from the US again. \"If the US thinks that it can dominate China, it can suppress China, I think has proven to be wrong,\" Ms Jin says. \"This is really signalling to the world, especially the United States, that China needs to be respected, that it will not kowtow or give too many political or economic concessions.\"Getty ImagesUS soybean farmers have been impacted by China's decision to stop buying the productTrump's team has found itself dealing with a stronger China compared to his first term. Beijing has learnt lessons, too. It spent the last four years finding new trade partners and relying less on US exports - nearly a fifth of Chinese exports once went to the US but in the first half of this year that figure dropped to 11%.Xi showed up in South Korea - after officially confirming the meeting with Trump just the day before - to take part in political theatre that seemed to underline a position of strength. As usual, he was in front of Trump for the handshake. He stood unblinking as Trump leaned forward to whisper in his ear - the kind of ad lib moment China abhors.At the end of the meeting, Trump ushered Xi to his waiting car where the Chinese leader was immediately surrounded by his security team. The US president was then forced to wander off camera to find his vehicle alone.And yet, there are many positives to take away from this superpower summit - the first of  Trump's second term in office.\"China wants to be in a position of strength when it comes to negotiations, but it won't break the relationship, because that is in nobody's interest, including China's,\" Ms Jin says. For starters, businesses, the markets and other countries caught in between the rivals will welcome the calm. But observers are not sure it will last. \"I think over the medium to long-term, the US and China have very serious differences, and I would not be surprised to see some more destabilisation in the next three to six months,\" says Ms Shaw.Has Trump got the bigger, better deal with China he always wanted? Not yet.Even if he does get a deal, and the two sides put ink on paper, Beijing has now shown that it is not willing to bend to Washington - and that it is more resilient.The rivalry between the two sides is likely to continue, if or even when there is ever a done deal.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump has announced the US will start testing nuclear weapons in what could be a radical shift in his nation's policy.\"Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, as he was about to meet the Chinese president  on Thursday. \"That process will begin immediately.\"The world's nuclear-armed states - those acknowledged as belonging to the so-called nuclear club and those whose status is more ambiguous - regularly test their nuclear weapons' delivery systems, such as a missile that would carry a nuclear warhead.Only North Korea has actually tested a nuclear weapon since the 1990s - and it has not done so since 2017.The White House has not issued any clarifications to the commander-in-chief's announcement. So it remains unclear whether Trump means testing nuclear delivery systems or the destructive weapons themselves. In comments after his post, he said nuclear test sites would be determined later.Many of the six policy experts who spoke to the BBC said that testing nuclear weapons could raise the stakes in an already dangerous moment where all signs showed the world was heading in the direction of a nuclear arms race - even though it has not yet begun. One of the six did not agree that Trump's comments would have a major impact - and another did not think the US was provoking a race - but all said the world faced a rising nuclear threat.\"The concern here is that, because nuclear armed states have not conducted these nuclear tests in decades - setting North Korea aside - this could create a domino effect,\" said Jamie Kwong, fellow in the nuclear policy programme at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"We're at a very concerning moment where the US, Russia and China are potentially entering this moment that could very well become an arms race.\"Darya Dolzikova, Senior Research Fellow for Proliferation and Nuclear Policy at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) - a London-based defence and security think tank - said she did not believe Trump's comments would change the situation massively.But, she added, \"there are other dynamics globally that have raised the risks of nuclear exchange and further proliferation of nuclear weapons to levels higher than they have been in decades\".Trump's message,  she said, \"is a drop in a much larger bucket, and there are some legitimate concerns of that bucket overfilling\".The experts pointed to escalating conflicts where one or more of the warring parties is a nuclear power - the war in Ukraine, for instance, in which Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened at times that he could use nuclear weapons. And then there were flare-ups - if not full-fledged conflicts - such as the one between Pakistan and India this year, or Israel - which has a policy of neither confirming nor denying it has nuclear weapons - attacking Iran - a country the West accuses of trying to build nuclear weapons (a charge Tehran denies). Tensions on the Korean peninsula and China's ambitions in Taiwan add to the overall picture.The last existing nuclear treaty between the US and Russia that limits their amounts of deployed nuclear arsenals - warheads ready to go - is set to expire in February next year.In his announcement, Trump said the US had more nuclear weapons than any other country - a statement that does not match figures updated regularly by another think tank that specialises in the field, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri).According to Sipri, Russia has 5,459 nuclear warheads followed by the US with 5,177, and China coming a distant third with 600.Other think tanks reported similar numbers.Russia announced recently it had tested new nuclear weapons delivery systems - including a missile the Kremlin said could penetrate US defences and another that could go underwater to strike the US coast.The latter claim may have led to Trump's announcement, some of the experts suspected, even though Russia said its tests \"were not nuclear\".Meanwhile, the US has been watching China closely - with increasing concern that it will reach near-peer status, too, and posing a \"two-peer nuclear risk\", experts said.So a resumption of US nuclear testing could prompt China and Russia to do the same. A Kremlin spokesman said that \"if someone departs from the moratorium, Russia will act accordingly\".In its response, China said it hoped the US would fulfil its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty - which both countries have signed but not ratified - and honour its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association, said a US resumption of nuclear weapons testing would be \"a mistake of historic international security proportions\".He said the risk of nuclear conflict \"has been steadily rising\" over several years and, unless the US and Russia \"negotiate some form of new constraints on their arsenals, we're likely going to see an unconstained, dangerous, three-way arms race between the US, Russia and then China in the coming years\".Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, said the average person should be \"very concerned\" because there has been an increase over the past five years in nuclear warheads for the first time since the Cold War.The last US nuclear weapons test - underground in Nevada - was in 1992. Kimball said it would take at least 36 months to get the Nevada site ready for use again.The US currently uses computer simulations and other non-explosive means to test its nuclear weapons, and therefore does not have a practical justification to detonate them, multiple experts said.Kwong said there were inherent risks even with underground testing, because you must ensure there is not a radioactive leak above ground and it does not affect groundwater.While blaming Russia and China for ratcheting up the rhetoric, Robert Peters, senior research fellow of strategic deterrence at the conservative Heritage Foundation,  said that, while there may not be a scientific or technical reason for testing a warhead, \"the primary reason is to send a political message for your opponents\".\"It may be necessary for some president, whether it's Donald Trump or whomever, to test nuclear weapons as a demonstration of credibility\", he said, arguing it was \"not an unreasonable position to hold\" to be prepared to test.While many others the BBC spoke to disagreed, all offered a fairly dire assessment of the current situation.\"My sense is that, if the new nuclear arms race hasn't already begun, then we're currently heading towards the starting line,\" said Rhys Crilley, who writes on the subject at the University of Glasgow. \"I worry every day about the risks of a nuclear arms race and the increasing risk of nuclear war.\"The US tested the first atomic bomb in July 1945 in the desert at Alamogordo, New Mexico.It later became the only country in the world to use nuclear weapons in warfare after dropping two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August of the same year during World War Two.",

    "body": "7 hours agoAnthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent, travelling with the presidentGetty ImagesThe main event of Trump's trip came in its final hours as he met with President XiUS presidential trips abroad have traditionally been an opportunity to display the power of the American nation on the world stage. Donald Trump's five-day swing through eastern Asia, on the other hand, has been a display of the power of Trump - but also, at times, of that power's limitations.Trump's stops in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea over the course of the first four days were an exercise in pleasing a sometimes mercurial American president. It was an acknowledgement that Trump, with the flick of a pen, could impose tariffs and other measures that have the potential to devastate the economies of export-dependent nations.His sit-down with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday, however, was something entirely different. It was a meeting of equals on the global stage, where the stakes for both nations – for their economies, for their international prestige, for the welfare of their people - were enormous.With China, Trump may flick his pen, but such actions come with consequences. They come with a cost.Trump hails 'amazing' meeting with Xi but no trade deal agreedXi and Trump find temporary truce as China plays longer gameFor the first four days, Trump's most recent foray into global diplomacy was smooth sailing. Each stop was punctuated by a blend of traditional trade negotiations – deals made under the shadow of Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs – and personal accommodations that at times bordered on the obsequious.In Malaysia, Trump secured access to critical minerals and made progress toward finalising trade arrangements with south-east Asian nations. He also presided over a treaty that should ease border tensions between Thailand and Cambodia – the kind of \"peace deal\" the American president loves to tout.ReutersTrump received a warm welcome - complete with gifts - from Japan's prime ministerIn Japan, Trump's Marine One flew past a Tokyo Tower lit red, white and blue – with a top in Trumpian gold.Newly elected Prime Minister Sanai Takaichi detailed $550bn in Japanese investments in the US and offered the American president a gift of 250 cherry trees for America's 250th birthday, and a golf club and bag that belonged to Shinzo Abe, the assassinated former prime minister who bonded with Trump in his first term. She also became the latest foreign leader to nominate Trump for his much-desired Nobel Peace Prize.Not to be outdone, South Korea welcomed Trump with artillery firing a 21-gun salute and a military band that played Hail to the Chief and YMCA – the Village People song that has become a Trump rally anthem.President Lee Jae Myung held an \"honour ceremony\" for Trump during which he gave the American leader his nation's highest medal and a replica of an ancient Korean dynastic crown.Lunch with Lee featured a \"Peacemaker's Dessert\" of gold-encrusted brownies. Later that day, the Koreans served Trump vineyard wine at an intimate dinner in Trump's honour with six world leaders attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference summit.Getty ImagesIn the US, Trump may be the subject of \"No Kings\" demonstrations by Americans who disapprove of his boundary-testing expansions of presidential power, but during his East Asia swing he was treated like royalty.And like the kings of old, Trump arrived in Korea seeking tribute – in the form of $200bn in cash payments, $20bn a year, from South Korea to the US, to be invested at the direction of Trump's government. Agreement on the terms of those payments helped ensure that the tariff rate on South Korean exports to the US would drop from 25% to 15%.The main event of Trump's Asia trip came in its final hours, however, as he met with Xi. There, the power dynamic between leaders of the world's two largest economies was decidedly different than the interactions Trump had with his foreign counterparts in previous days.Missing were all the pomp and the pageantry. No military bands, no honour guards, no carefully crafted menus celebrating mutual national affection. Instead, the two leaders and their top aides sat across a long white negotiating table in a nondescript military building just off the runway of Busan's international airport.Watch: Handshakes and whispers: Trump and Xi’s meeting…in 73 secondsIt was perhaps a reflection of the high stakes that when Trump shook hands with Xi in Busan, he appeared tense. It was a far cry from his relaxed attitude when he told me the day before that he was optimistic he would have a good meeting.\"I know a little bit about what's going on because we have been talking to them,\" he said. \"I'm not just walking into a meeting cold.\"For months, Trump had been threatening higher tariffs on Chinese exports to the US – as a source of revenue for the American treasury as well as to pressure China to open its markets and control the export of chemicals used to make the drug fentanyl.China, unlike many of America's other trading partners, responded with escalation, not concessions.If tariffs were a source of economic hardship for China, then Beijing would target America's vulnerabilities. It suspended purchase of US agricultural products and proposed export controls on its large supply of critical minerals - resources that the US, and much of the world, rely on for high-tech manufacturing.Trump's mood was upbeat after the meeting, which he described as \"amazing\" and graded a 12 on a scale of 1-10. The president appeared in a good mood even as the plane jostled from rough turbulence as it climbed into the sky.But it was a battle of wills and economic pain set the two nations on a path that ultimately led to Thursday's meeting and an agreement on both sides to de-escalate. The US lowered its tariffs, while China eased access to critical minerals, and pledged to resume importing US agricultural products and increase purchases of US oil and gas.While it may not have been a breakthrough, it was an acknowledgement by both sides that the existing situation was unsustainable.ReutersThe US president was positive about his meeting with his Chinese counterpart on ThursdayThe international order that will take its place, however, is far from clear. As Xi acknowledged in his opening remarks at the bilateral meeting, China and the US \"do not always see eye to eye with each other\".\"It is normal for the two leading economies in the world to have frictions now and then,\" he said.That may represent an improved outlook after months of tension, but it was also an sign that \"frictions\" are here to stay.China has global and regional ambitions and a growing willingness to expand its influence.Trump, for his part, has attempted to reorder American priorities abroad, using US economic might to pressure allies and adversaries alike. And it is those American allies – nations like Japan and South Korea that have long relied on American political, economic and military support -  that are scrambling to adjust to the new reality.Some of that scrambling comes in the form of  a bend-backward willingness to accommodate Trump in forms large and small. Gifts and dinnertime honours are easy, but multibillion dollar payments, increased military spending and permanent tariffs take a toll. And they could ultimately prompt a reevaluation of relations with America – and, as a result, with China.Trump may have received a king's welcome in South Korea, but, in what could be viewed as a bit of on-point symbolism, as he departed, it was Xi who was arriving. And the Chinese leader's Korean hosts had promised a diplomatic reception equal to that received by the Americans.Xi is fully participating in the Apec leaders meetings – proceedings that Trump chose to skip. If there is a vacuum created by America's international manoeuvres, it is a void China appears more than willing to fill.Trump may be returning to America with everything he wanted from this trip. But, in a twist on the Rolling Stones song that he used to play at his political rallies, it's not yet clear that he got what America needs.",

    "body": "Video has emerged appearing to show the alleged thieves behind the Louvre heist making their escape on a mechanical ladder in broad daylight.Two people can be seen looking around frantically as they slowly descend, minutes after the famed Paris museum was broken into and €88m-worth  (£77m)  of France's crown jewels were stolen.    The gang of four thieves have not been caught and on Wednesday, the Louvre's boss admitted that staff had failed to spot them early enough because there was only one camera pointing on the gallery where the items were displayed.In the video, the truck fitted with the ladder is seen parked by on a busy road running along the Seine as vehicles pass. Laurence des Cars told French lawmakers that the Louvre planned to double the number of CCTV cameras in and around the museum. She admitted that the camera trained on the Gallery of Apollo, the south-side room where the jewels were kept, was facing the wrong way.Paris city prosecutor Laure Beccuau told the Ouest France newspaper that up to 150 DNA samples and fingerprints had been retrieved so far as part of the police investigation.The theft happened in less than eight minutes, after the thieves arrived at 09:30 on Sunday (07:30 GMT) after the Louvre opened its doors to the public.They stole eight items including an emerald necklace and earrings given as a wedding gift by Napoleon Bonaparte to his second wife, Marie-LouiseAs they fled, they dropped a 19th-Century diamond-studded crown belonging to Empress Eugenie. Although it was recovered, the crown was damaged and des Cars said it had probably been crushed as the thieves prised it from its display case.",

    "body": "3 hours agoJack BurgessGetty ImagesEcuador's president has said someone attempted to poison him by putting three highly concentrated toxic substances in gifts of chocolate and jam.Daniel Noboa said his team had proof to support the claim, though he has yet to publicly provide any evidence.The South American leader told CNN on Thursday that he believed it was \"practically impossible\" that the three chemicals would be found in high concentrations in the items by chance.His comments come in the wake of violent clashes in Ecuador over a sharp rise in fuel prices under his presidency. The centre-right politician has brought in military crackdowns on drug gangs, but has also faced accusations of targeting protesters.Noboa has denied the allegations of attempts on his life - the third in two months - were a means of portraying his detractors as violent.\"No one throws a Molotov cocktail at themselves... or poisons themselves with chocolate, or throws stones at themselves,\" he said, referring to previous incidents.Early in October, Ecuador's government said five people were detained over what it described as an alleged assassination attempt.About 500 people threw rocks at the president's car and there were \"signs of bullet damage\" on his vehicle, according to the country's energy and environment minister, who added that Noboa was unharmed.The BBC was not able to independently confirm that a bullet had been fired.The government also said that, in late September, a humanitarian convoy containing Noboa was attacked and 17 soldiers taken hostage.Ecuadorian officials said the convoy - which included UN and EU diplomats - was delivering aid to communities affected by a national strike when ambushed by about 350 people, who attacked it with Molotov cocktails.Noboa posted photos of smashed windscreens and windows on the cars on social media.A national strike protesting against the government ending diesel subsidies came to a close on Thursday after several weeks.The strike was declared by the country's largest Indigenous organisation - the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie) - with marches and roadblocks organised.The Conaie group led demonstrations that overthrew three presidents between 1997 and 2005.",

    "body": "6 hours agoLana Lam and Helen Livingstone,in SydneyFour servicewomen have launched a landmark class action lawsuit against the Australian military alleging sexual abuse, harassment and discrimination.Lawyers said they expected thousands of women to join the case against the Australian Defence Force (ADF), which was filed in the Federal Court on Friday.Claims by the four women leading the lawsuit - whose names are withheld for legal reasons - include being forcibly pinned to a wall before being groped, and waking up naked and bruised after a party with male officers.An ADF spokesperson said it was developing a sexual misconduct prevention strategy and there was \"no place for sexual violence\" in the army.All women who served between 12 November 2003 and 25 May 2025 are eligible to join the suit, lodged by law firm JGA Saddler. One of the lead applicants was a member of the air force who was one of two women in a building of about 200 people. She alleged she was subject to hostile and sexist comments, inappropriate conversations, as well as being shown unsolicited pornographic photos.She also alleged her sergeant told her \"women shouldn't be paid as much as men because they are not as strong\".Another of the four applicants, who joined the navy, said she was subject to lewd comments throughout her training and unwanted touching. She also alleged that while on duty abroad she was grabbed and kissed by her a colleague who resisted her attempts to get away.A major report into suicide among Australian veterans last year found that about 800 reports of sexual assault were made within the ADF between 2019 and 2024.It noted that there was an estimated under-reporting rate for sexual assault of 60% in the ADF and that that was \"only a subset of all forms of sexual misconduct that occur\". \"The threat of war often isn't the biggest safety fear for female ADF personnel, it is the threat of sexual violence in their workplace,\" said lawyer Josh Aylward from JGA Saddler.\"They have signed up to defend their country, not to fight off fellow ADF personnel on a daily basis, all while simply trying to do their job.\"An ADF spokesperson acknowledged there was \"work to be done\" and added that \"all defence personnel have a right to be respected and deserve to have a positive workplace experience in the ADF\".",

    "body": "34 minutes agoBasillioh Rukanga and Paul Njie,BBC Africa, GarouaCameroon's opposition leader Issa Tchiroma Bakary, who has declared himself the winner of the 12 October elections, has told the BBC that he will not accept a stolen vote, with the results due to be announced on Monday.He says his team has compiled the overall picture based on results from individual polling stations, so there is no doubt.Tchiroma Bakary, 76, is a former government minister who broke ranks with President Paul Biya, 92, who is seeking another term after 43 years in power.The ruling party has dismissed Tchiroma Bakary's victory claims and several officials have described it as illegal because only the Constitutional Council can proclaim official results.Tchiroma Bakary said he had urged his supporters to defend their votes, adding: \"We will never accept their votes being stolen by anyone.\"He said he was not concerned about being arrested or being put in jail, \"but I know that I have already won the presidential election\".\"There is no doubt, no shadow of doubt whatsoever. My victory is undeniable,\" he told the BBC in an interview.Can Biya, the world's oldest president, keep his title?He said the ruling CPDM party had \"their backs against the wall\" and could not accept the reality of the vote, and challenged them to show if what he was saying about the election was wrong.He defended his decision to declare himself himself the winner, insisting that the law \"does not prevent us from so doing\".Asked whether he would accept defeat if someone else is declared the winner, he said he would agree \"provided the Constitutional Council announces the results that comes from the ballot box, not ballot stuffing\".Tensions over the delayed announcement of the election results have been growing, sparking fears of post-electoral violence in a country already rocked by a separatist conflict in the Anglophone regions and Boko Haram insurgency in the Far North region.The highly respected and influential Catholic Church in Cameroon this week urged calm following fears that violence could erupt once official results are declared.Catholic bishops said they hoped the official result would reflect the will of the electorate, and \"nothing will be changed by any authority involved in this exercise\".",

    "body": "24 hours agoStephen McDonell,China correspondent and Joel GuintoReutersZhang Shengmin heads anti-corruption efforts in the army and is seen as a trusted loyalist of President XiThe Chinese Communist Party has named a veteran who has overseen anti-corruption efforts in the military to be the country's second highest ranking general, just days after nine generals were expelled in a major purge.The appointment of Zhang Shengmin as second-ranked vice chairman of the Central Military Commission was announced at the end of a four-day Central Committee meeting.Zhang becomes the third highest official in the country's top military body, after the first-ranked vice chairman and President Xi Jinping.The nine expelled generals were suspected of serious financial crimes, China's defence ministry said last week. However, analysts said it could also be seen as a political purge.Their removal marked one of the Chinese Communist Party's largest public crackdowns on the military in decades.For months, the Central Military Commission has signalled that it would conduct a crackdown. In July, it issued new guidelines calling for the elimination of \"toxic influence\" in the military and listing out \"iron rules\" for cadres.The crackdown follows smaller-scale public purges of other military officials in recent years, including former defence ministers Wei Fenghe and Li Shangfu.Following his promotion Zhang, 67, will serve with another more senior vice chair, Zhang Youxia, on the Central Military Commission.He is a general from the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force and has been serving as deputy secretary of the Central Military Commission's anti-corruption arm.He comes from the central province of Shaanxi and joined the army in 1978.Getty ImagesThe appointment comes after one of the Chinese Communist Party's largest public crackdowns on the military in decades.During the four-day meeting that ended Thursday, the party's Central Committee also approved a new five-year-plan – a broad document to guide its priorities.The plan emphasised \"scientific and technological self-reliance\", something Chinese tech companies will need if the Trump Administration continues to restrict access to computer chips and advanced software.The document also called for \"accelerating the green transition\" and \"modernising defence\" as well as boosting domestic consumption to make up for lost export revenue, during a time of geopolitical uncertainty.",

    "body": "A German company inadvertently embroiled in the Louvre Museum heist after one of its lifts was used in the theft is making the most of its free publicity - by launching a new advertising campaign.Werne-based firm Böcker this week published a social media post featuring the now-famous image of its furniture ladder extending up to a balcony outside the Gallery of Apollo. \"When you need to move fast,\" reads a banner under the image. \"The Böcker Agilo transports your treasures weighing up to 400kg at 42m/min - quiet as a whisper.\"Video has emerged of the alleged thieves escaping on the mechanical ladder after stealing €88m worth (£76m; $102m) of France's crown jewels on Sunday.The company's managing director, Alexander Böcker, told news agency AFP on Wednesday that, when it became clear no one was injured in the heist, it had used \"a touch of humour\" to draw attention to the family-run business.\"The crime is, of course, absolutely reprehensible, that's completely clear to us,\" Mr Böcker said.\"It was... an opportunity for us to use the most famous and most visited museum in the world to get a little attention for our company.\" How Louvre gang carried out France's most shocking theftStolen Louvre jewellery worth €88m, prosecutor saysCan France retrieve its priceless crown jewels - or is it too late?Reaction to Böcker's new campaign has been enthusiastic, with responses on social media including \"marketing genius\" and \"excellent, that is German quality\".\"Your messaging takes the crown,\" one commenter quipped.Mr Böcker told AFP that he recognised his company's device from news reports, saying the machine was sold \"a few years ago to a French customer who rents this type of equipment in Paris and the surrounding area\".The alleged jewel thieves had arranged to have the machine demonstrated to them last week and had stolen it during the demonstration, he said.The thieves arrived at the Louvre on Sunday shortly after the museum opened its doors.Within eight minutes, they had made off with some of France's most valuable treasures, including those belonging to former royalty and imperial rulers.Among the eight items stolen were diadems, necklaces, earrings and brooches adorned with thousands of diamonds and other precious gemstones.The Louvre reopened on Wednesday, a few days after what has been called France's most shocking theft.The museum's director admitted on Wednesday that security failed to spot the gang early enough to stop the theft and that CCTV around its perimeter was weak and \"aging\".\"We failed these jewels,\" Laurence des Cars said, adding that no-one was protected from \"brutal criminals - not even the Louvre\".\"We've had a terrible failure at the Louvre. I've taken responsibility for it,\" she added.Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez told France's Europe1 radio that he had \"every confidence\" the thieves would be caught.Prosecutors said they believed the robbers acted under orders from a criminal organisation.",

    "body": "18 hours agoFavour NunooBBC Africa, AccraGhana's former First Lady Nana Konadu Agyeman-Rawlings has died at the age of 76.She was the widow of Ghana's longest-serving leader, Jerry John Rawlings, who died five years ago.He led two coups before twice being elected president in multiparty polls.Social media is awash with tributes to the former first lady, politician and women's rights advocate, who Ghanaian presidential spokesperson Felix Kwakye Ofosu said had died after a short illness on Thursday morning.Her family visited President John Mahama in the afternoon to officially notify him of her death. The president leads the National Democratic Congress (NDC) party, founded by Jerry Rawlings after he took power.Agyeman-Rawlings also had political ambitions - but lost out in her bid to become the NDC's presidential candidate in 2012.  Why Jerry Rawlings divided opinion in GhanaJerry Rawlings: Remembering Ghana's 'man of the people'As first lady, she founded the 31st December Women's Movement to empower women and teach them how to earn money to develop their communities. It was named after the date of her husband's second coup, which took place in 1981.Born in November 1948, Agyeman-Rawlings came from a middle-class family and grew up in the city of Cape Coast.She met her future husband when she became a boarder at the prestigious Achimota School in the capital, Accra.Unlike her husband, she went on to get a university education, studying art and textiles.Jerry Rawlings joined the air force and earned the rank of flight lieutenant in 1978 - a year after the couple were married.It was not long afterwards that Rawlings, aged 32, took power, with his wife said to be one of his most important advisers.Young, glamourous and charismatic, they proved a dynamic if controversial duo in the West African nation. Together they had four children and their eldest - Dr  Zanetor Agyeman-Rawlings - has gone into politics serving as an NDC MP.The former first lady's women's group, initially regarded as an arm of the NDC, is credited with significantly helping women across the country - especially in poorer areas.Her advocacy also influenced national policy and she played a key role in shaping a law in 1989 that guaranteed inheritance rights for women and children.She is also credited with contributing to provisions for gender equality in Ghana's 1992 constitution, which saw the return of multiparty politics.Ghana's parliament has adjourned to mark the former first lady's death as the country prepares to officially mourn one of its most iconic political figures and one who fought for the inclusion of women in politics.",

    "body": "15 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterReutersChangpeng Zhao, founder of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, has been pardoned by US President Donald Trump.Zhao, also known as \"CZ\", was sentenced to four months in prison in April 2024 after pleading guilty to violating US money laundering laws.Binance also pleaded guilty and was ordered to pay $4.3bn (£3.4bn) after a US investigation found it helped users bypass sanctions.The pardon reignited debate over the White House embrace of cryptocurrency as the Trump family's own investments in the industry have deepened.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called Zhao's prosecution under the Biden administration part of a \"war on cryptocurrency\", pushing back on critics who said the pardon appeared motivated by Trump's personal financial interests. \"This was an overly prosecuted case by the Biden administration,\" she said, adding that the case had been \"thoroughly reviewed\". \"So the president wants to correct this overreach of the Biden administration's misjustice and he exercised his constitutional authority to do so.\"Binance had spent nearly a year pursuing a pardon for its former boss, who completed his four-month prison sentence in September 2024, the WSJ reported on Thursday.Its campaign came as Trump, who released his own coin shortly ahead of his inauguration in January, promised to take a friendlier approach to the industry than his predecessor.Since then, he has loosened regulations, sought to establish a national cryptocurrency reserve and pushed to make it easier for Americans to use retirement savings to invest in digital assets.Zhao, who stepped down as Binance chief executive in 2023, wrote on social media on Thursday that he was \"deeply grateful for today's pardon and to President Trump for upholding America's commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice\".The pardon lifts restrictions that had stopped Zhao from running financial ventures, but it's not yet clear whether it changes his standing with US regulators or his ability to lead Binance directly.In a statement Binance called the decision \"incredible news\". The exchange, which is registered in the Cayman Islands, remains the world's most popular platform for buying and selling cryptocurrencies and other digital assets.It did not respond to further questions about the conflict of interest claims.Before the pardon, Zhao's companies had partnered with firms linked to Trump on new digital-currency projects including Dominari Holdings, where his sons sit on the board of advisers and which is based in Trump Tower.The Wall Street Journal also previously reported representatives of the Trump family - which has its own crypto firm World Liberty Financial - had recently held talks with Binance.The Trump administration previously halted a fraud case against crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun, after his investments in the Trump family's crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. He has also pardoned founders of the crypto exchange BitMex, who also faced charges related to money laundering, and Ross Ulbricht, founder of the Silk Road, the dark web marketplace known as a place for drug trade.Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale wrote on social media that he loved Trump but the president had been \"terribly advised\" on pardons.\"It makes it look like massive fraud is happening around him in this area,\" he said.Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, blasted the decision in a statement as a \"kind of corruption\".Asked about the decision to pardon Zhao on Thursday, Trump appeared not to not know who he was.\"Are you talking about the crypto person?\" he asked, later saying he had granted the pardon at the \"request of a lot of good people\".When US officials announced the Binance guilty plea in 2023, they said Binance and Zhao were responsible for \"wilful violations\" of US laws, which had threatened the financial system and national security.\"Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit,\" said then-Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.\"Its wilful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform.\"Zhao stepped down as Binance chief executive as part of the resolution of the case, writing at the time that resigning was \"the right thing to do\". \"I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility,\" he said.Additional reporting by Bernd Debussman Jr",

    "body": "12 hours agoDearbail Jordan and Chris GrahamEU leaders have agreed to help support Ukraine's \"financial needs\" for the next two years - but stopped short of releasing billions of euros in frozen Russian cash to help fund the country's defence on Thursday night.A decision to use €140bn (£122bn) in Russian assets held in a Belgian clearing house was pushed back until December after concerns were raised by Belgium. The controversial move would be on top of sanctions the bloc has imposed on Russia - the latest targeting the Kremlin's oil revenues.The Brussels meeting came ahead of a London summit on Friday, where UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will urge European leaders to boost long-range missile supplies to Kyiv.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to attend the meeting of the so-called \"coalition of the willing\", alongside Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Netherlands' Dick Schoof. Other leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, will join virtually.European ministers held talks in Brussels on Thursday about how billions of euros worth of frozen Russian cash could be made available to Ukraine as a so-called \"reparations loan\".Many EU governments had hoped the leaders would back the plan and request the European Commission, the EU's executive body, to work out a formal legal proposal in the coming weeks.But the final text, adopted after a marathon discussion, stopped short of greenlighting the plans. Instead, it asked the Commission for \"options for financial support based on an assessment of Ukraine's financing needs\".\"Russia's assets should remain immobilised until Russia ceases its war of aggression against Ukraine and compensates it for the damage caused by its war,\" the declaration added. The aim is now for EU leaders to iron out the remaining concerns at another summit in December.\"This is a topic that is certainly not trivial. It's very complex,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said following Thursday's talks. \"It was also very clear there are points to be clarified.\"Antonio Costa, European Council President, sounded a positive note, saying the bloc had \"committed to ensure that Ukraine's financial needs will be covered for the next two years\".\"Russia should take good note of this: Ukraine will have the financial resources it needs to defend itself,\" he told a news conference.Zelensky, who was in Brussels for the summit, welcomed the outcome as a signal of \"political support\" for the notion of using Russian assets to keep Kyiv in the fight.There are a number of legal complexities surrounding using Russia's money. Belgium, in particular, has been reluctant to back using the frozen assets as it is nervous about having to shoulder any potential consequences should Russia legally challenge Euroclear, the clearing house where the money is located.Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said his country needed concrete and solid guarantees before supporting the plan, pointing out that it was \"unchartered territory\".The Belgian government has argued any potential litigation could ultimately create a major financial crisis.\"Can this [plan] be legal? That is a very good question... There are no clear answers,\" De Wever said. \"We will in any case be buried in litigation. That seems like a certainty.\"Russia has criticised the EU's proposals.\"Any confiscatory initiatives from Brussels will inevitably result in a painful response,\" said Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova.The EU's latest sanctions followed US measures against Russia's oil industry - the first time Donald Trump has sanctioned Moscow as he grows frustrated over Vladimir Putin's refusal to end the war.After the US sanctions were announced on Wednesday evening, the US president confirmed that a planned meeting with his Russian counterpart in Budapest had been shelved indefinitely.\"Every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere,\" he said.The US sanctions targeted Russia's oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil. In response, Putin said the \"unfriendly\" US measures \"will have certain consequences, but they will not significantly affect our economic well-being\".The economic impact of the sanctions is expected to be minimal, as Moscow's biggest customers include China, India and Turkey - though Trump has urged these nations to halt purchases.Oil is one of Russia's largest exports. Ukraine wants to use long-range missiles to target Russian oil and energy plants in a bid to limit its war-fighting resources.Zelensky had hoped to secure Tomahawk cruise missiles from the US last week - but Trump refused, saying the weapons were \"highly complex\" and take a year of intense training to use.The EU's latest punitive measures against Russia saw member states agree to phase out Russian energy imports, as well as targeting three Chinese businesses - two oil refineries and an energy trader - that are \"significant buyers of Russian crude oil\".The measures are \"meant to deprive Russia of the means to fund this war\", said  Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign affairs spokeswoman, adding that they also send a message that \"Russia can't outlast us\".China condemned the decision, which a commerce ministry spokesperson said \"seriously undermined the overall framework of China–EU economic and trade co-operation\".",

    "body": "8 hours agoJessica ParkerBerlin correspondentBBCA BBC investigation last year found that Germany was being used to store boats and engines used in small-boat crossingsThere are growing doubts that Germany will tighten its laws this year to make it easier to prosecute small-boat smugglers, the BBC has learned.Facilitating people-smuggling is not technically illegal in Germany if it is to a third country, which the UK is after Brexit.Germany has agreed to close the loophole by the end of 2025.But now the Interior Ministry in Berlin says only that it intends to introduce the bill to the German parliament, or Bundestag, by that date – and has stopped short of guaranteeing a timeline for its final approval.A spokesperson would not be drawn on whether time was running out ahead of the Christmas break – but told the BBC that the federal government had \"no influence\" over parliamentary process once a bill had been agreed by cabinet.Some UK officials are increasingly unsure whether enough space is left in the Bundestag's calendar this year, though the Home Office insists it has not been told of any setbacks by Berlin.A staffer at the Bundestag, who is tracking the proposal, said there may \"theoretically\" be a sufficient window but admitted it did not appear to be a government priority.It comes as France is backing away from a recent commitment to intervene more forcefully at sea to stop small boats,  according to multiple sources contacted by the BBC.France retreats from pledge to intercept migrant boatsThe UK's Labour government is under pressure to show that its emphasis on closer international collaboration – striking deals with other countries – can work as an effective strategy to tackle small boat crossings.Last year, a BBC investigation exposed how Germany is used as a hub by small-boat smugglers to store dinghies that are then used for illegal English Channel crossings.‘Death trap’ Channel boats traded by smugglers in German city - BBC undercoverBerlin's subsequent commitment to adapt the law – and make such activities more explicitly illegal – was lauded as \"further evidence\" by the UK that its approach was \"bearing fruit\".Any delay is likely to spark frustration in the UK, as it has long pressed Berlin to tighten its rules and enforcement.STEFAN ROUSSEAU/POOL/AFPSir Keir Starmer (L) and Germany's Friedrich Merz signed a landmark treaty last JulyA legal provision has been drafted to further expand \"criminal liability for cross-border human smuggling to the United Kingdom\", according to the Interior Ministry in Berlin.However, the ministry has not confirmed that the plans have yet to be approved by Cabinet - a necessary step before being laid before parliament.The proposals are not widely known about in Germany, where the domestic debate focuses on internal levels of immigration.There is also some scepticism in Berlin about how much difference the law change will make in meeting UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's repeated pledge to \"smash the gangs\".Germany's announcement that it would change the law nearly a year ago came just months after the BBC's investigation.The following July, alongside a landmark treaty, the UK and Germany said that the aim was to for the Bundestag to adopt the legislation by the end of 2025.Chancellor Friedrich Merz told the BBC at the time that he believed that not much time would be needed to enact the change after the summer recess.It will give German prosecutors \"more tools to tackle the supply and storage of dangerous small boats equipment\", according to the UK government.Currently, investigators have to rely on \"collateral crime\" such as violence or money laundering – or have used judicial orders from other countries to carry out raids.A UK Home Office spokesperson said: \"We welcome the commitment from Germany to make it illegal to facilitate illegal migration to the UK.\"\"The law change is expected to be adopted by the end of the year,\" they said, while adding that the process was a matter for the German government.",

    "body": "1 day agoOlga Ivshina, Anastasia Platonova and Yaroslava Kiryukhina,BBC RussianHead of Belgorod region press officeFirefighters trying to put out a vehicle fire after a drone strike on Belgorod, RussiaResidents of Russia's Belgorod region say blackouts, air-raid sirens and the sound of gunfire aimed at incoming Ukrainian drones are becoming increasingly common, as Kyiv retaliates against repeated bombardments of its cities with cross-border strikes of its own.\"It's so loud and so terrifying,\" says Nina, a Belgorod resident who asked us to change her name.\"I was coming back from the clinic when a siren went off. As usual, I received Telegram alerts about a drone attack. Then bursts of automatic gunfire broke out, I ran into a nearby courtyard and tried to hide under an arch,\" she recalls.\"The next day it all happened again - air defence fire, automatic gunfire, explosions.\"The number of Ukrainian drone attacks on the Belgorod region has increased nearly fourfold since the start of 2025, according to BBC News Russian analysis based on data from local authorities.In September, more than 4,000 Ukrainian drones were recorded in the Belgorod region, compared with around 1,100 in January 2025. In one of the biggest strikes last month, the region was attacked with more than 260 drones, according to the governor. There has also been an increase in missile attacks since the summer.Ukraine continues to suffer far greater losses from Russia's near-daily missile and drone strikes, which routinely kill civilians and leave cities across the country without power and heat. At least seven people were killed, including two children, in Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities overnight into Wednesday, and there are fears that the coming winter may be the harshest yet for Ukraine.DSNS UkraineSeveral people were killed on Wednesday in Russian strikes on Kyiv and the surrounding regionUkrainian authorities say the recent surge of attacks on Belgorod, some of which have caused huge blackouts, is a direct result of Russia's latest onslaught on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.\"Maybe they should stop being too comfortable there in Belgorod?\" Zelensky said earlier this month. \"They must understand: if they want to leave us without power, then we will do the same\".Belgorod region is a key logistics corridor and staging hub for Russian forces near the border with Ukraine. It is also a regular point of origin for artillery and short-range drone strikes.Although there were local electricity outages in smaller towns in the region earlier in the war, the city of Belgorod was largely unaffected by power cuts until this autumn.Local student Ekaterina (not her real name) told the BBC she was at home in the city on the evening of 28 September, when notifications started appearing on her phone: \"Missile alert! Take shelter!\"The sound of howling sirens followed, and the lights in her flat started flickering.\"We ran to the corridor, because the explosions started almost immediately. They were very loud. The lights blinked and went out,\" Ekaterina recalls.Neighbourhoods of Belgorod lost power after a missile strike and power cut in OctoberMissiles had hit the main Belgorod heat and power plant and a substation, local Telegram channels reported.And while the city centre had its electricity back relatively quickly, some in the suburbs were left without power until morning. Across the region, around 77,000 people, or 5% of the population, still had no electricity the next day.\"While you're in the office in the centre, you wouldn't necessarily notice that there was a blackout. But when you're going home it's like entering a whole different world,\" another Belgorod resident Natalya (not her real name) tells the BBC. \"Complete darkness outside. Apartment blocks are without power, the shops are dark too. As you ride through the darkness, it's hard to tell where your stop is - you can't see anything\".Another big blackout came less than a week later.Authorities admit they do not have the capacity to provide everyone with back-up generators and have called on residents to buy their own.\"But what are we suppose to fuel them with, given the fuel crisis?\" Maria, an elderly resident who also asked to change her name, tells the BBC.More than half of Russia's regions, including Belgorod, have been affected by petrol and diesel shortages, due to increased Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil refineries.Surge in Ukrainian attacks on oil refineries sparks Russian fuel shortages\"And the prices for generators have shot up as well,\" Maria says.Ukraine has increased production of its \"Darts\" drone - lightweight and cheap models that can carry a 4kg (9lb) warhead - and many Belgorod residents say this is the reason the strikes have become more frequent. The drones are effective both for single and mass launches which can potentially overload air defence systems.But the recent strikes on energy infrastructure that caused the blackouts in Belgorod are more likely to have involved heavier weapons. Reports say long-range Himars rockets or Morok drones with larger warheads might have been used.Head of Belgorod region press officeBelgorod has introduced mobile armed units to try to shoot down dronesAnd while for many in Russia the war still seems far away, residents of Belgorod region now feel its impact daily, like Ukrainians over the border.\"Until September, the war seemed to have faded into the background again. But now we are getting constant reminders - through power outages, fuel shortages, and a general sense of anxiety\", says Yakov, who declined to give his real name. \"I personally have a strong feeling that, by continuing the war, Russia is racing headlong toward the abyss\".Additional reporting by Ilya Abishev",

    "body": "2 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorKiran Ridley/Getty ImagesThe Louvre attendant described the moment thieves burst into the first-floor galleryA gallery attendant on duty at the Louvre when thieves broke in and stole eight of France's crown jewels has said \"no-one could have been prepared\" for what unfolded as visitors began to arrive on Sunday morning.\"All of a sudden we heard an huge noise,\" she told radio station France Inter, in the first account given by an attendant at the scene.The unnamed attendant and two colleagues initially thought the noise to be an angry visitor, but it was not a normal sound: \"It was a dull, slightly metallic noise.\"It was, in fact, the moment thieves had used an angle grinder to burst through a reinforced window into the Gallery of Apollo, where the Louvre's collection of historic jewelry is kept.Within eight minutes, the gang seized treasures, including a necklace that belonged to Napoleon's wife Empress Marie-Louise and a diadem of Napoleon III's wife Empress Eugenie, worth an estimated total of €88m (£77m).The thieves used a mechanical ladder on the back of a lorry to lift them to a first-floor balcony to gain entry to the gallery.Two tourists ran towards them in panic, she said. \"I saw one of the criminals turn around with something that looked to me like a chainsaw, then I yelled at my colleagues to get out,\" she recalled. She shouted a second time that it was a robbery and that they should run.Watch: Two people leave Louvre in lift mounted to vehicleOne of her colleagues raised the alarm over a walkie-talkie and then \"we finished evacuating the visits without quite realising really what was going on\". They shut all the doors as they left to protect the neighbouring galleries.On reflection, the attendant said \"for us it was unbelievable the display cases could have been broken... never for a moment did we think there was such a risk... nobody can be prepared for that\".How Louvre gang carried out France's most shocking theftNo camera covered Louvre wall where jewel thieves broke in, director saysLouvre heist lift-maker seizes the moment with new ad campaignAnother Louvre employee came forward to describe the moments after the gang escaped.The anonymous security guard spoke of a very strong smell of petrol as he arrived at the scene outside the Louvre where the gang had parked their lorry.\"I ran outside through the [glass] pyramid and across the courtyard... I got there at the very moment the criminals got away by scooter,\" he told BFMTV.The gang had ruptured the lorry's fuel tank and there was a blowtorch near by, he said. \"It's clear they intended to set fire to their vehicle. I genuinely think we thwarted their plan because they would never have left behind so much evidence.\"\"They even lost one of the pieces they'd meant to steal, because they'd lost [Empress] Eugenie's crown, which they'd just stolen and it had fallen on the ground.\"The security guard and his colleagues were the first to find the crown, he said: \"I can't say I jumped for joy, especially because the piece had obviously been damaged.\"Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen A tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenThe director of the museum, Laurence des Cars, said the empress's crown appeared to have been damaged when the gang prised it out of a narrow gap they had cut in one of the two display cases with an angle grinder.She told French senators this week that initial indications were that \"delicate restoration\" would be possible for the 19th-Century crown inlaid with diamonds and emeralds.Although French ministers insist security at the museum had worked properly on the day, the Louvre director has spoken of years of underfunding and of just one external security camera, facing the wrong way, where the break-in took place.Her damning assessment was backed up by the attendant, who complained that \"for some time we've felt the culture of security is in decline at the museum\".",

    "body": "1 hour agoNardine SaadAFP via Getty ImagesFBI director Kash Patel described the fraud scheme as \"mind-boggling\"Celebrities, professional sports stars and wealthy gamblers sat at a table hoping to win big in a game of Texas Hold 'Em.But they didn't know it was nearly impossible. They were \"fishes\" allegedly being targeted by the mafia in an elaborate poker gambling scheme that included X-ray card tables, secret cameras, analysers in chip trays and sunglasses and contact lenses that could read their hand. In what sounds like an Ocean's Eleven film plot, prosecutors say these \"unwitting\" victims were cheated out of at least $7m (£5.25m) in poker games - with one person losing at least $1.8m.The scheme, which US prosecutors described as \"reminiscent of a Hollywood movie\", was dismantled in a sprawling federal investigation that led to more than 30 arrests, including members of La Cosa Nostra crime families, Portland Trail Blazers basketball coach Chauncey Billups and former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Damon Jones. FBI director Kash Patel called it a \"mind-boggling\" fraud scheme that cheated victims in New York, Miami, Las Vegas and other US cities. Arrests in the scheme were announced on Thursday along with those in an alleged basketball betting plot, in which professional NBA players are accused of faking injuries to influence betting odds. The underground poker scheme started as early as 2019, prosecutors say, and was allegedly operated by the mafia - specifically by members of notorious crime families, including Bonnano, Gambino, Lucchese and Genovese. A cut of the profits, prosecutors say, helped fund their criminal enterprise. Former professional athletes, described by prosecutors as \"face cards\", were enlisted to help in the scheme and entice victims into playing. Lured in by the opportunity to play with a high-profile celebrity - such as Billups or Jones - a wealthy, \"unwitting victim\" would be recruited for illegal, underground poker games where tens of thousands of dollars were on the line, prosecutors allege. Unbeknownst to the lured-in players - referred to in the scheme as a \"fish\" - everyone surrounding them was in on the elaborate scam - from the players to the dealers, even the technology used to shuffle the deck and count the chips, according to a lengthy federal indictment. Sophisticated wireless technology was also used to deceive the players during the games, most commonly in Texas Hold 'Em.What we know about gambling arrestsUS Department of JusticeAn X-ray poker machine was employed to read facedown cards and a rigged card-shuffling machine was also used in the plot, prosecutors sayThe technology was everywhere - an X-ray table that read any face-down card, analysers inside chip trays, a rigged shuffling machine that read cards and predicted who would have the best hand, and pre-marked cards that allowed those wearing special sunglasses and contact lenses to read what was in everyone's hands. Secretive cameras - built into tables and light fixtures - also helped convey information to those helping in the plot, authorities say. Then there was also a sophisticated method of communicating and rigging the game, prosecutors allege. Information from the game would be sent to an off-site conspirator - called an \"operator\" by prosecutors - who then would send information to another player sitting at the table who was in on the scheme - who prosecutors call a \"quarterback\" or \"driver\". That person would then secretly signal to others, prosecutors allege, effectively stealing money and making it impossible for victims to win. Texts from the US justice department's evidence suggest the \"quarterback\" would either touch the $1,000 poker chip, tap his chin, wrist or arm to signal which conspirator had the best hand. If the victim had the best hand, the \"quarterback\" would touch his black chips.The texts also appear to show that at times conspirators agreed to lose some hands in order to keep victims at the gambling table for longer.US Department of JusticeAnother series of texts suggests participants in the scheme avoided suspicion of cheating by swapping in players and losing money to co-conspirators.Authorities estimate that each game would leave a victim out of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.Prosecutors say the defendants allegedly laundered the funds from the scheme through cryptocurrency, cash exchanges and shell companies. A cut of the profits went to those who helped in the plot, prosecutors say, and some allegedly went to fund the mafia's criminal enterprise. \"This alleged scheme wreaked havoc across the nation, exploiting the notoriety of some and the wallets of others to finance the Italian crime families,\" said FBI Assistant Director in Charge Christopher Raia.Billups, who was accused of being a face card in the fixed card games, was arrested in Portland and was placed on leave by the NBA. The Portland Trail Blazers said in a statement that they were aware of the allegations involving their head coach and were \"fully co-operating with the investigation\".Jones was arrested in relation to both the poker and NBA injuries scheme. He is charged with two counts each of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy.",

    "body": "19 hours agoSteve RosenbergBBC Russia EditorSputnik/Alexander Kazakov/Pool via Reuters and ReutersOne week ago I had the distinct feeling it was Groundhog Day, or as the Russians call it, Dyen Surka.Amid US threats to pressure Moscow - by supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine - Vladimir Putin and President Donald Trump held a telephone call. The result: the announcement of a US-Russia summit in Budapest.Last August, amid threats of additional US sanctions against Russia, Putin met Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff. The result: the announcement of a US-Russia summit in Alaska.Déjà vu.But Groundhog Day seems to be over.The Alaska meeting went ahead, with minimal preparation and little result.But the Budapest summit is off. It barely had time to be \"on\", to be fair. Now President Trump has cancelled it.\"It didn't feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get,\" the US president told reporters.And that's not all.Previously, Trump had not followed through on threats of more pressure on Russia, preferring carrots to sticks in his dealings with the Kremlin.For the moment he has put his carrots away. Instead he's imposed sanctions on two major Russian oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. That's unlikely to force a U-turn on the war from President Putin. But it's a sign of Trump's frustration with the Kremlin's unwillingness to make any compromise or concessions to end the fighting in Ukraine.Trump says Putin talks 'don't go anywhere' as he imposes new sanctionsWhat's the significance of US sanctions on Russian oil?The Russians don't take kindly to sticks.On Thursday, President Putin told reporters that the new US sanctions were an \"unfriendly act\" and an attempt to put pressure on Russia.\"But no self-respecting country and no self-respecting people ever decide anything under pressure.\"Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev was less diplomatic.\"The USA is our enemy and their talkative 'peacemaker' has now fully set on the path to war with Russia,\" he wrote on social media. \"The decisions that have been taken are an act of war against Russia.\"Thursday morning's edition of the tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets was slightly less dramatic, but obviously unflattering. The paper criticised \"the capriciousness and fickleness of [Russia's] main negotiating partner.\"So what's changed?Instead of rushing off to summit no. 2, as he had done for summit no.1, this time around President Trump was slightly more cautious. He had asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio to lay the groundwork for the summit with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to make sure there was a point in decamping to Budapest.It soon became clear that there wasn't, and that a new summit now was unlikely to produce a breakthrough. Russia is fiercely opposed to Donald Trump's idea of freezing the current battle lines in Ukraine. The Kremlin is determined to take control, at the very least, of the entire Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. It has seized and occupied much of it. But President Volodymyr Zelensky is refusing to cede to Russia those parts of the Donbas that Ukraine still controls.ReutersMembers of Russia's National Guard patrol Red Square near St. Basil's Cathedral in central Moscow on 23 OctoberMoscow would have welcomed a second US-Russia summit. The first, in Alaska, was a diplomatic and political coup for the Kremlin. The red-carpet welcome in Anchorage for President Putin symbolised Russia's return to the international stage and the West's failure to isolate Moscow. Over the last week Russian state media have been savouring the idea of a summit with President Trump in Europe, but without the European Union at the table. Russian commentators portrayed the proposed meeting in Budapest as a slap in the face for Brussels.At the same time, few here seemed to believe that, even if it went ahead, the Budapest summit would produce the kind of result Moscow wanted. Some Russian newspapers have been calling for the Russian army to continue fighting.\"There isn't a single reason Moscow should agree to a ceasefire,\" declared Moskovsky Komsomolets yesterday.That doesn't mean the Kremlin doesn't want peace.It does. But only on its terms. And right now those are unacceptable to Kyiv and, it would appear, to Washington. Those terms involve more than just territory. Moscow is demanding that what it calls the \"root causes\" of the Ukraine war be addressed: an all-encompassing phrase with which Russia broaden its demands to include a halt to Nato enlargement eastwards. Moscow is also widely believed to retain the goal of forcing Ukraine back into Russia's orbit.Is Donald Trump ready to increase the pressure on Russia even more?Possibly.But it's also possible we may wake up one morning and find ourselves back in Groundhog Day.\"In the game of Trump tug-of-war, Russia is leading again,\" wrote Moskovsky Komsomolets after the Budapest summit had been announced. \"In the couple of weeks before the meeting in Budapest, Trump will be pulled in the opposite direction by telephone calls and visits from Europe. Then Putin will pull him back to our side again.\"",

    "body": "32 minutes agoOsmond Chia,Business reporter, and Maia DaviesGetty ImagesUS President Donald Trump has announced an immediate end to all trade negotiations with Canada over an advert critical of the tariffs he has imposed on the nation.The advert, sponsored by the government of Canada's province of Ontario, quoted Trump's predecessor, Ronald Reagan, an icon of US conservatism, saying tariffs \"hurt every American\".Trump wrote on social media that the advert was \"FAKE\" and \"egregious\", adding that trade talks were \"HEREBY TERMINATED\".His administration has imposed a 35% levy on many Canadian imports, as well as individual tariffs targeting particular industries like car and steel manufacturing. Ontario has been particularly hard-hit by these.Trump has allowed exemptions for goods that fall under a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada that he negotiated during his first term.But Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney has since his election earlier this year attempted to strike a deal that would ease the US tariffs.This has been complicated by Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who is one of the most vocal critics of the taxes levied on US firms buying Canadian products.In the minute-long advert published last week, Reagan's voice can be heard narrating over images that include the New York Stock Exchange and cranes adorned with both US and Canadian flags.The video excerpts a 1987 national radio address by Reagan that focused on foreign trade.\"When someone says, 'let's impose tariffs on foreign imports', it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes, for a short while it works, but only for a short time,\" Reagan says in the advert.\"Over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American, worker and consumer.\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars... Markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down and millions of people lose their jobs.\"The Ronald Reagan Foundation - which is charged with preserving his legacy - released a statement on Thursday saying the advert had used \"selective\" audio and video of the former president's remarks.It said the advert \"misrepresents\" the former president's address, without specifying why, and accused the Ontario government of not seeking permission to use and edit the remarks.The foundation said it was \"reviewing its legal options\".Trump referenced this statement, and said the video was designed to \"interfere with\" the US Supreme Court's upcoming decision in November on whether Washington's sweeping tariffs on many nations' products are legal.  The court's decision represents the biggest test of Trump's presidential authority and signature economic policy, potentially forcing the US to refund billions collected in tariffs.While the minute-long advert only includes excerpts from the original, five-minute-long address, it does not alter Reagan's words.The order in which he makes the comments has been changed. The advert's penultimate sentence is taken from near the beginning of his speech, and a phrase that features about halfway through the advert is likewise taken from an earlier point in the address.The original address - titled Address to the Nation on Free and Fair Trade - is regarding a specific set of tariffs the Reagan administration had at the time imposed on some Japanese goods.Reagan seeks to use the speech explain why he had introduced the tariffs in this \"special case\" despite his belief that \"imposing such tariffs or trade barriers and restrictions of any kind are steps that I am loath to take\".He makes clear that he wants to lift them as soon as possible \"to promote the prosperity and economic development that only free trade can bring\" - a position he stresses throughout the speech.Trump later doubled down on his criticism of the advert, writing that \"Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY\".Getty ImagesDoug Ford, Ontario's premier, has been a vocal critic of Trump's economic policiesThe advert was run as part of a campaign worth $75m Canadian dollars (£40m; $54m) on mainstream TV channels in the US.In a post accompanying the advert, Ford wrote that \"we'll never stop making the case against American tariffs on Canada\".China's embassy in Washington also used a similar Reagan clip in a post on X to cast doubt on Trump's global tariffs earlier this year.Ontario is Canada's most populous province and its largest regional economy, and has suffered the most as a result of the US tariffs. Ford hit back at Trump's earlier tariff threat against Canada by saying he was willing to cut off power supply to the US.He had also described Washington's trade policies against Canada as having pulled a knife and \"yanked it into us\", and called on US lawmakers to put pressure on Trump.Trump's sector-specific levies on Canadian goods include a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.The White House's global tariffs - particularly on steel, aluminium and cars - have hit Canada hard, forcing job losses and putting pressure on businesses.Carney and Ford have not yet commented on Trump's announcement.It is the second time Trump has said he was ceasing trade talks with Canada, after Ottawa announced it would impose a digital services tax on US technology firms earlier this year.When Canada rescinded the tax, the White House said Carney had \"caved\" to pressure from Trump.",

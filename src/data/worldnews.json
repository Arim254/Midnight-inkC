    "body": "Bus carrying pilgrims overturns in Brazil killing 15 on board9 hours agoJames GregoryGovernment of AlagoasThree children, seven women and five men were among the dead, local authorities saidAt least 15 people have died as the bus they were travelling in overturned in northeastern Brazil, local officials have said.The vehicle had been carrying about 60 people who were returning from a pilgrimage when it crashed on a curved stretch of a highway in the rural interior of Alagoas state on Tuesday morning.Three children were among those who died, a statement said, while some surviving passengers were airlifted to hospital for treatment.Footage on social media shows a bus turned on its side, with debris surrounding it and emergency crews at the scene.An investigation has been launched. Authorities said they believed that the driver had lost control of the bus before it left the highway and rolled over several times.According to media reports, the most seriously injured patient transferred to hospital was a nine-year-old child who suffered a head injury.The passengers were taking part in the pilgrimage of Our Lady of Candeias, a religious festival in the state of Ceará.The bus was part of a convoy carrying hundreds of people from the city of Coité do Noia in Alagoas to Juazeiro do Norte in Ceará, a journey spanning 563km (350 miles) which normally takes around eight hours.The incident happened in São José da Tapera on the final stretch of the journey back to Coité do Noia.Bueno Higino Filho, mayor of Coité do Noia, told local media: \"The loss is immense. They were all my friends... I woke up today to the sad news and I'm heading to the site of the accident to see what we can do [to help].\"Three days of mourning have been declared by the governor of Alagoas state. \"I stand in solidarity with the family members and friends in this moment of such great pain,\" Paulo Dantas wrote on social media.

The coastguard has not yet clarified the exact circumstances around the collision. A search and rescue operation was ongoing on Tuesday night, which involved four coastguard vessels, a privately owned boat carrying civilian divers, and a helicopter.Greek state broadcaster ERT said the injured included seven children, a pregnant woman and two coastguard officers.Four deaths were initially reported but an update issued at 23:00 local time (21:00 GMT) said ten additional bodies had been recovered, bringing the confirmed death toll to 14.",

    "body": "9 hours agoIan AikmanGetty ImagesThe pair are suspected of attempting to sabotage naval vessels at the Port of Hamburg (file photo)Two suspects have been arrested over the attempted sabotage of German naval vessels docked at the Port of Hamburg last year.The pair are suspected of deactivating electronic safety switches, removing fuel tank caps, puncturing water supply lines, and dumping more than 20kg (44.1lb) of abrasive gravel into a ship's engine.\"If gone undetected, the acts would have caused major damage to the ships and delayed their departure, endangering the operations of the German Navy,\" the EU's Eurojust crime agency said in a statement.The suspects are a 37-year-old Romanian man and a 54-year-old Greek man who worked at the port, according to local media reports.The suspects were arrested in Germany and in Greece on Tuesday following a coordinated effort between German, Greek and Romanian authorities.Officers also searched and seized evidence from the suspects' homes in Germany, Greece and Romania, Eurojust said.An investigation into the full circumstances around the incident is ongoing, the agency added.While officials in Germany have not explicitly linked the Hamburg incident to Russia, the arrests come amid heightened fears over Kremlin-backed sabotage across the continent. Germany and other Nato countries have seen a string of suspected sabotage incidents since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Undersea communications cables in the Baltic have been damaged, and suspected drone activity has caused major disruption at airports and military bases.Though some European governments have directly accused Russia of involvement, the Kremlin has consistently denied orchestrating sabotage operations.Germany has sought to increase its resilience to potential sabotage after an arson attack, which was previously linked to left-wing activists, left tens of thousands without power earlier this year.",

    "body": "11 hours agoMaia DaviesReuters/Getty ImagesThe apparent resemblance was first reported on the front page of a national Italian newspaper on SaturdayChurch and government officials in Italy have launched an investigation into claims that the face of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni was painted on an angel during the restoration of a fresco in Rome.Italy's culture ministry has sent officers to inspect the artwork in a chapel of the Basilica of St Lawrence in Lucina, while the Diocese of Rome expressed its \"disappointment\" and said it would determine who had been responsible.The artist, Bruno Valentinetti, said he had simply restored the fresco he painted in 2000 and denied modelling the angel after the prime minister.Meloni responded in a post on Instagram saying she was \"definitely not like an angel\", accompanied by a laughing emoji.The apparent likeness was first reported on Saturday by Italian newspaper La Repubblica, which ran before-and-after pictures of the fresco and claimed the angel holding a map of Italy had previously looked like a \"generic cherub\".The parish priest said the paintings had simply been touched up following recent water damage - but said he did not \"understand the fuss\" in any case.\"Painters used to put all sorts of things in frescoes,\" Monsignor Daniele Micheletti said.Valentinetti, 83, denied the claims. \"The restored face is the one that was painted 25 years ago,\" he said, in remarks reported by news agency AGI.\"Who says it resembles Meloni?\"Opposition parties were quick to urge an investigation. Irene Manzi of the Democratic Party called the situation \"unacceptable\" while the Five Star Movement said art must not become \"a tool for propaganda\", whether or not it depicted Meloni.Culture Minister Alessandro Giuli ordered \"technical officials\" to inspect the painting \"to ascertain the nature of the intervention\" and determine next steps.The Diocese of Rome, meanwhile, said it knew about the restoration but that it had been told nothing would be added or changed.\"The modification of the cherub's face was the decorator's initiative, not communicated to the competent authorities,\" it said in a statement shared by news agency Ansa.It later said the Cardinal Baldo Reina - the Pope's Vicar for the Diocese of Rome - would immediately investigate \"to determine the possible responsibilities of those involved\".It said the cardinal \"distances himself from Monsignor Micheletti's statements and expresses his disappointment over what happened\" and stated its \"commitment to the protection of its artistic and spiritual heritage\" against misuse or exploitation.",

In 2015, he was given a death sentence in absentia by a Libyan court for his role in the crackdown.He shaped policy and led high-profile negotiations despite having no official role in government, including those which led his father to abandon his nuclear weapons programme.Such agreements saw international sanctions on the north African country lifted, and some considered Gaddafi a reformist and acceptable face of a changing Libya.Gaddafi had always denied that he wanted to inherit power from his father, saying the reins of power were \"not a farm to inherit\".However, in 2021 he announced he would run for the presidency in elections which were then postponed indefinitely.",

The pupil fled the classroom before being caught in the schoolyard, and was later arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.Toulon's public prosecutor Raphaël Balland said the suspect did not appear to have had a religious or political motive, adding: \"All we know is that there had been tensions with this teacher recently, and he was angry with her.\"La Guicharde school was evacuated after the attack in the early afternoon and Wednesday's lessons were cancelled, a regional education official said.Earlier on Tuesday, France's Education Minister Edouard Geffray said he was heading \"immediately\" to the school in Sanary-sur-Mer, a coastal area of the Var region.\"My thoughts immediately go to the victim, her family, and the entire educational community, whose deep shock I share,\" he wrote on X.It is the latest in a series of attacks by students in French schools in recent years.In 2025, a 14-year-old was charged with the murder of a teaching assistant after allegedly stabbing her to death in June. In a separate case in April, a student killed a girl and wounded several others in a knife attack in the western city of Nantes.In 2020, teacher Samuel Paty was murdered by a Chechen refugee outside the school where he taught in a suburb of Paris, an attack which was motivated by religious extremism.

    "body": "18 hours agoYang TianGetty ImagesHarvard has been a central target in the White House's campaign to stamp out what it calls \"woke\" ideologies on American campusesUS President Donald Trump announced he will be seeking $1bn (£730m) in damages from Harvard University in his administration's ongoing feud with the institution.The news comes after the New York Times reported that the Trump administration had to backtrack from its demand for a $200m payment in negotiations with the university.Trump cited the story in a Truth Social post late on Monday, blaming Harvard for \"feeding a lot of nonsense\" to the New York Times.Trump officials have accused Harvard of not doing enough to tackle antisemitism during pro-Palestinian protests. Harvard has rejected the accusation.Harvard has been a central target in the White House's campaign to stamp out what it calls \"woke\" and \"radical left\" ideologies on American campuses.In April last year, Trump revoked around $2bn in research grants to Harvard and froze federal funding.The university sued the Trump administration over the move, saying no government \"should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue\".A US federal court later overturned the billions in funding cuts, ruling the government had violated university's free speech rights.The White House vowed to immediately challenge the \"egregious decision\", saying Harvard remains \"ineligible for grants in the future\".Before Monday's announcement, the government had been in discussions with Harvard over a potential deal to unfreeze federal funding. \"We are now seeking One Billion Dollars in damages, and want nothing further to do, into the future, with Harvard University,\" Trump wrote on Monday.He accused Harvard of \"serious and heinous illegalities\", but did not clarify how he believed it had broken the law.  Trump has previously threatened to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status and take control of the university's patents stemming from federally funded research.Three other Ivy League universities, Columbia, Penn and Brown, struck deals with Trump to preserve funding that was at risk due to similar claims by the administration, rather than go to court.",

    "body": "15 minutes agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterGetty ImagesThe French offices of Elon Musk's X have been raided by the Paris prosecutor's cyber-crime unit, as part of an investigation into suspected offences including unlawful data extraction and complicity in the possession of child pornography.The prosecutor's office also said both Musk and former X chief executive Linda Yaccarino had been summoned to appear at hearings in April.In a separate development, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) announced a probe into Musk's AI tool, Grok, over its \"potential to produce harmful sexualised image and video content.\"Writing on X, Musk said the raid was a \"political attack\".The company said in a statement that it was \"disappointed\" but \"not surprised,\" and accused the Paris Public Prosecutor's office of an \"abusive act.\"X also denied any wrongdoing and said the raid \"endangers free speech.\"The investigation began in January 2025 when French prosecutors started looking into content recommended by X's algorithm, before being widened in July that year to include Musk's controversial AI chatbot, Grok.Yaccarino also took to X to accuse French prosecutors of carrying out \"a political vendetta against Americans.\"\"To be clear: they are lying,\" added Yaccarino, who left the firm last year.Following Tuesday's raid, French prosecutors say they are now investigating whether X has broken the law across multiple areas.Among potential crimes it said it would investigate were complicity in possession or organised distribution of images of children of a pornographic nature, infringement of people's image rights with sexual deepfakes and fraudulent data extraction by an organised group.New UK investigationMeanwhile, UK authorities have given an update on their investigations into sexual deepfakes created by Grok and shared on X.The images - often made using real images of women without their consent - prompted a barrage of criticism in January from victims, online safety campaigners and politicians.The company eventually intervened to prevent the practice, after Ofcom and others launched investigations.In an update on Tuesday, Ofcom said it was continuing to investigate the platform and was treating it as \"a matter of urgency\".But it added it was currently unable to investigate the creation of illegal images by Grok in this case because it did not have sufficient powers relating to chatbots.However, shortly afterwards the ICO said it was launching its own probe, in conjunction with Ofcom, into the processing of personal data in relation to the Grok.\"The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people's personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this,\" said William Malcolm, the ICO's executive director for regulatory risk & innovation.A Commission spokesperson said it was in touch with France over its search of X's office in Paris.'Not a free country'Pavel Durov - founder of the messaging app Telegram - criticised the French authorities on Tuesday, accusing France of being \"the only country in the world that is criminally persecuting all social networks that give people some degree of freedom\". \"Don't be mistaken: this is not a free country,\" he added in a post on X.Durov was arrested and detained in France in August 2024 over alleged moderation lapses on his messaging app, which the Paris prosecutor's office said had failed to curb criminal activity.He was permitted to leave the country last March after the platform made some changes to the way it operates following the arrest.",

    "body": "5 hours agoAna Faguy and Kayla EpsteinWashingtonWatch: Trump says the federal government \"should get involved\" in electionsUS President Donald Trump has urged Republicans to \"nationalise\" elections and repeated his false claims of 2020 election fraud in a new podcast interview. American elections are primarily run by state law, and voting has long been administered by local officials across the country. \"The Republicans should say: 'We want to take over. We should take over the voting in at least 15 places.' The Republicans ought to nationalise the voting,\" Trump said during an appearance on the podcast of his former deputy FBI director, Dan Bongino.His remarks come days after the FBI raided an elections office in Georgia to examine voting records from the 2020 election.In the interview, Trump did not name the \"15 places\" where he thought Republicans should \"nationalise\" voting.The president tied his desire to federalise voting mechanisms to his key agenda item of deporting undocumented immigrants from the US. \"If Republicans don't get them out, you will never win another election as a Republican,\" he said. While speaking to Bongino, Trump also referenced the FBI's raid in Georgia's Fulton County, saying that \"you're going to see some interesting things come out\".Trump narrowly lost the state to Joe Biden in 2020. He has repeatedly said his loss was due to fraud - an unsubstantiated claim.Trump faced two criminal indictments related to alleged election interference in Georgia; a federal case that ended after he returned to the White House last year, and a Georgia state racketeering case that fell apart. He denied any wrongdoing.In the new podcast interview, Trump claimed he won the 2020 election \"in a landslide\" and said, without evidence, that people \"vote illegally\".Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the president \"believes in the United States Constitution, however he believes there has obviously been a lot of fraud and irregularities that have taken place in American elections\".Leavitt said that Trump's podcast remarks were in support of the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, which would require voters to show documentary proof of citizenship at the time of registration. Proponents say it will help reduce voter fraud, which experts say is rare, and ensure non-citizens do not vote illegally. Critics argue it will place unnecessary barriers on US citizens seeking to register to vote.Non-citizens already cannot vote in US federal elections for president and Congress and in most statewide races. Last week, the FBI said it was conducting a \"court-authorised law enforcement activity\" at the Fulton County Election Hub. Fulton County officials said that the government's warrant \"sought a number of records related to 2020 elections\".Some local officials expressed anger at the raid.\"This is an assault on your vote,\" Fulton County Commissioner Mo Ivory said.Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has confirmed that she was present for the raid, saying that Trump personally asked her to be on-site.Gabbard's first comments on the matter came in a letter that was sent to a group of senators on Monday, saying her presence was \"executed under [her] broad statutory authority to coordinate, integrate, and analyze intelligence related to election security, including counterintelligence (CI), foreign and other malign influence and cybersecurity\".In the letter, Gabbard confirmed that there had been a call in the wake of the raid between FBI agents on the ground and Trump. The call, which was first reported by the New York Times, raised some eyebrows as it is unusual for a president and on-the-ground law enforcement to directly communicate in such a case.Gabbard said she \"facilitated a brief phone call for the president to thank the agents personally for their work. He did not ask any questions, nor did he or I issue any directives\".Watch: Trump talk of taking over elections is about voter ID bill, says White House",

    "body": "5 hours agoTiffany WertheimerEPA/ShutterstockPedro Sánchez said the changes would protect children from the \"digital Wild West\"Spain has become the latest European country to make plans to ban social media for children under the age of 16.\"We will protect them from the digital Wild West,\" Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said at the World Governments Summit in Dubai on Tuesday.The ban, which still needs parliamentary approval, is part of a raft of changes that include making company executives responsible for \"illegal or harmful content\" on their platforms.France, Denmark and Austria have also announced that they are considering their own national age limits.Social media companies have argued that the bans would be ineffective, difficult to implement and could isolate vulnerable teenagers. Reddit is challenging Australia's ban in the High Court.\"Today, our children are exposed to a space they were never meant to navigate alone,\" Sánchez said, describing social media as a place of \"addiction, abuse, pornography, manipulation [and] violence. \"We will no longer accept that. We will protect them.\"Sánchez first mooted a possible ban in November, but on Tuesday, the plan was fleshed out.Under the changes, social media platforms would be required to have effective age verification systems, \"not just check boxes, but real barriers that work,\" the prime minister explained, in a possible reference to the loopholes Australian children use to bypass checks - including simply using a photo of an adult. The new laws would also criminalise manipulating algorithms to amplify illegal content.\"This is something created, promoted, and disseminated by certain actors whom we will investigate, as well as the platforms whose algorithms amplify disinformation in exchange for profit,\" Sánchez said.\"Hiding behind code and claiming that technology is neutral is no longer acceptable.\"There would also be a new system designed to track \"how digital platforms fuel division and amplify hate\". No further details were given on how this would work. Another measure, Sánchez said, would be to \"investigate and prosecute the crimes committed by Grok [X's AI tool], TikTok, and Instagram\". The European Commission has launched an investigation into Grok over concerns it was used to create sexualised images of real people. The UK has announced its own investigation into Grok and on Tuesday in France, the offices of X were raided by the Paris prosecutor's cyber-crime unit as it looked into allegations of offences including unlawful data extraction and complicity in the possession of child pornography.X is yet to respond to either investigation - the BBC has approached it for comment. It has previously characterised the French investigation as an attack on free speech.Sánchez said he hoped to get the laws passed next week, but that could prove difficult because his left-wing coalition government lacks a parliamentary majority. Spain's main opposition party, the conservative People's Party, seems to approve of the ban, saying it has previously proposed similar restrictions. The far-right Vox party has spoken out against it, however.In response to the announcement, X owner Elon Musk labelled Sánchez as a \"tyrant and traitor to the people of Spain\".TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube, Reddit, Discord and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram have all been approached for comment.France has led the charge in Europe, with President Emmanuel Macron saying he wants a ban for under-15s in place by the start of the next school year in September.",

    "body": "7 hours agoIan AikmanUS Navy via ReutersThe drone was \"aggressively\" approaching the USS Abraham Lincoln, a spokesman said (file photo) An Iranian drone was shot down as it \"aggressively approached\" an American aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea on Tuesday, a US military spokesman has said.An F-35C stealth fighter jet which took off from the USS Abraham Lincoln warship shot down the drone \"in self-defence\" to protect the aircraft carrier and its personnel, US Central Command spokesman Capt Tim Hawkins said.The ship was approximately 500 miles from the Iranian coast when the drone approached it with \"unclear intent\".No US equipment was damaged and no service members were harmed.It comes as the US continues to build up a military presence in the region, with tensions high between Washington and Tehran.US President Donald Trump has threatened to take military action against Iran if it does not negotiate an agreement to restrict its nuclear programme. Speaking after the downing of the Iranian drone, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that negotiations between the US and Iran are still scheduled for later this week.She said Trump \"remains committed to always pursuing diplomacy first\", but added he \"has always a range of options on the table, and that includes the use of military force\".Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has previously warned that any attack on the country would spark a \"regional war\".Tehran has not commented on Tuesday's drone incident. In a separate incident on Tuesday, the US military said Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) forces had \"harassed a US-flagged, US-crewed merchant vessel\" in the Strait of Hormuz - the world's busiest oil shipping channel.Military support \"de-escalated\" the situation and the tanker proceeded safely, Capt Hawkins said.Also on Tuesday, Leavitt said US special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's most senior overseas envoy, will attend the talks on behalf of the White House.US media had previously reported he would meet Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Istanbul on Friday, with the foreign ministers of Egypt, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also invited.But US news website Axios has since cited two sources as saying Tehran wanted the venue moved to Oman, with only Iranian and US officials present.Ahead of the planned talks, Washington has repeatedly reminded Tehran of the US strikes on Iran last year, which Trump said had \"obliterated\" the country's nuclear enrichment facilities.He said a fresh attack would be \"far worse\" than those air strikes, which were launched last June during Israel's 12-day war with Iran.The Israeli military also targeted Iran's nuclear facilities and scientists during a short direct conflict, as well as its military commanders and missile arsenal.Tehran responded to the strikes by launching hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel. It also carried out a missile attack on a major US air base in Qatar.Iran has insisted its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and denies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.Last week, Trump told reporters at the White House that Iranian officials \"do want to make a deal\", and that they must commit to \"no nuclear\" and to \"stop killing protesters\". The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has said it has confirmed the killing of 6,424 protesters, 152 children, 214 people associated with the government, and 58 bystanders. It is also investigating reports of another 11,280 deaths.Norway-based Iran Human Rights has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.Iranian authorities have acknowledged that at least 3,117 people were killed, but said the majority were members of the security forces or bystanders killed by \"rioters\".The unrest was sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency and soaring cost of living, but it quickly developed into demands for political change.Khamenei described the unrest as \"sedition\" orchestrated by the US and Israel.",

    "body": "No defect found in switch of jet grounded by Air India - regulator12 hours agoCherylann Mollan,MumbaiandSharanya Hrishikesh,DelhiGetty ImagesRepresentative image of a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. The plane had flown from London to BengaluruIndia's aviation regulator said it found no defect in the fuel control switch of a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner jet grounded by Air India based on a pilot's report.The issue was reported on Sunday after the plane, which took off from London, landed in Indian's Bengaluru city.The regulator said that while starting the engine during take-off, the crew noticed that twice the fuel control switch - which regulates the flow of fuel into the plane's engines - did not \"remain positively latched in the run position when light vertical pressure was applied\". It remained stable the third time and the crew closely monitored the aircraft during the flight, which \"was completed without incident\".Air India had said in a statement on Monday that it informed India's aviation regulator about the issue and that it was getting the pilot's concerns checked on a \"priority basis\". A Boeing spokesperson had told the BBC in response to a question that the company was supporting Air India's \"review of this matter\".The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said on Tuesday that when the switches were operated according to Boeing's recommended procedure, they were found to be \"satisfactory\", staying at run instead of moving to cut-off (which can stop fuel supply to the engines).It added, however, that incorrectly handling the switch caused it to \"move easily from run to cut-off\".These checks were performed in the presence of DGCA officials on the affected aircraft and another aircraft, the statement said. The DGCA has also asked Air India to circulate Boeing's recommended procedure to operate the switch to its crew members.  The grounding of the plane gained a lot of attention as it came amid an ongoing investigation into last June's plane crash involving an Air India aircraft of the same model which killed 260 people.The crash of the London-bound Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner occurred less than a minute after the plane took off from Ahmedabad airport in western India. India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is investigating the crash and a final report is expected to be released in a few months.Air India crash plane had record of safety defects, campaigners claimWhy cockpit audio deepens the mystery of Air India crashIndia's aviation regulator had also ordered an investigation of cockpit fuel switches in Boeing 787 and Boeing 737 aircraft operating in the country after the crash. Air India had said then that its inspections did not find any issue with the locking mechanism of the switch, which it reiterated on Monday.  \"Air India had checked the fuel control switches on all Boeing 787 aircraft in its fleet after a directive from the DGCA [Directorate General of Civil Aviation], and had found no issues,\" the airline said in the statement.On Tuesday, Reuters news agency reported that Air India had begun re-checking the fuel switches on its Boeing Dreamliner aircraft following the incident flagged by the pilot.Aviation consultant and former air accident investigator Tim Atkinson told the BBC that he trusted Boeing's design of the fuel control switches.\"These switches are designed with one purpose in mind, and that is that they cannot be moved unintentionally. There is no doubt in my mind that the design is good. I would be astonished to find it had some kind of latent defect,\" he said.With additional reporting from Theo Leggett.",

    "body": "10 hours agoJessica RawnsleyReutersThe US Department of Justice released around three million more documents linked to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation on FridayThe US Department of Justice (DOJ) has removed thousands of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein from its website after victims said their identities had been compromised.Lawyers for Epstein's victims said flawed redactions in the files released on Friday had \"turned upside down\" the lives of nearly 100 survivors. Email addresses and nude photos in which the names and faces of potential victims could be identified were included in the release.Survivors issued a statement calling the disclosure \"outrageous\" and said they should not be \"named, scrutinized and retraumatized\".The DOJ said it had taken down all the flagged files and that mistakes were due to \"technical or human error\".Watch: Why is no one being prosecuted over the Epstein files?In a letter submitted to a federal judge on Monday, the DOJ said: \"All documents requested by victims or counsel to be removed by yesterday evening have been removed for further redaction.\"The department said it was continuing to examine new requests, as well as checking whether there are any other documents that may need further redaction.  A \"substantial number\" of documents independently identified have also been removed, it added.Under the terms of the release, which was mandated after both chambers of Congress approved a measure compelling the DOJ to publish the documents, the federal government was required to redact details which could identify victims.On Friday, two lawyers representing victims asked a federal judge in New York to order the DOJ to take down the website hosting the files, calling the release \"the single most egregious violation of victim privacy in one day in United States history\".Brittany Henderson and Brad Edwards said there was \"an unfolding emergency that requires immediate judicial intervention\" due to the DOJ \"failing to redact victims names and other personally identifying information in thousands of instances\".Several of Epstein's victims added comments to the letter, including one who described the release as \"life-threatening\" and another who said she had received death threats after her private banking details were published.Speaking to the BBC on Tuesday, Epstein survivor Annie Farmer said: \"It's hard to focus on the new information that has been brought to light because of how much damage the DOJ has done by exposing survivors in this way.\"Another of Epstein's victims, Lisa Phillips, said that many of the survivors were \"very unhappy with the outcome\" of the release. \"The DOJ has violated all three of our requirements,\" she told BBC's Newsday on Tuesday. \"Number one, many documents still haven't been disclosed. Number two, the date set for release has long passed. And number three, DOJ released the names of many of the survivors.\"She added: \"We feel like they're playing some games with us but we're not going to stop fighting.\"Gloria Allred, a women's rights lawyer who has represented many of Epstein's victims, previously told the BBC that numerous victims' names had been disclosed in the latest release, including some who had not been identified publicly previously.\"In some cases... they have a line through the names but you can still read the names,\" she said. \"In other cases, they've shown photos of victims - survivors who have never done a public interview, never given their name publicly.\"A spokesperson for the DOJ told the BBC's US news partner CBS that it \"takes victim protection very seriously and has redacted thousands of victim names in the millions of published pages to protect the innocent\".They added that the department was \"working around the clock to fix the issue\" and \"to date 0.1% of released pages\" had been found to have unredacted information that could identify victims.Millions of files relating to Epstein have been released by the DOJ since a law mandated their release last year, including three million pages, 180,000 images and 2,000 videos last Friday.That release came six weeks after the department missed a deadline signed into law by US President Donald Trump under bipartisan Congressional pressure that mandated all Epstein-related documents be shared with the public.Epstein died in a New York prison cell on 10 August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.More on this story",

    "body": "3 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editor, Oslo district courtNTB/Ole Berg-Rusten via REUTERSMarius Borg Høiby (C) wore a white T-shirt as he sat in court with his defence counselThe trial of Marius Borg Høiby, son of Norway's crown princess, has heard the first account from a woman he is alleged to have raped at a party in 2018.The woman told the court in tears she had no recollection of what had happened, after an earlier sexual encounter that lasted a matter of seconds.Facing 38 charges against him, Marius Borg Høiby pleaded not guilty to raping four women and other serious offences but admitted breaking a restraining order, transporting marijuana and speeding while \"partly\" admitting threats and aggravated assault.He is due to take the stand for the first time in the trial on Wednesday afternoon.Although he has grown up as Crown Prince Haakon's stepson, Marius Borg Høiby is not a member of the royal family or a public figure. However, the first count of rape is alleged to have taken place in his parents' basement on their Skaugum estate outside Oslo.As the trial began at Oslo district court on Tuesday, the palace came under increasing pressure to explain his mother's three-year exchange of messages with the late sex-offender Jeffrey Epstein between 2011 and 2014.Crown Princess Mette-Marit has already admitted to \"poor judgement\", after details emerged of a four-day stay at his home in Palm Beach, Miami. But the palace has said little more as further revelations have emerged.No photos were allowed as her son entered courtroom 250 at Oslo district court at the start of a seven-week trial.Wearing thick-rimmed glasses, a brown sweater and olive-green trousers, the blond defendant fiddled with a bracelet, speaking very quietly as he pleaded not guilty to raping four women. He later removed his sweater and sat in a plain, white T-shirt.Paul Kirby/BBCState prosecutor Sturla Henriksbø (L) read out the 38 charges as the trial got under wayProsecutor Sturla Henriksbø said he would be treated no differently than any other Norwegian. But in an impassioned opening statement, defence counsel Ellen Holager Andenæs said he had already been subjected to prejudicial treatment from the media.It would be strange, she said, if someone facing such a \"tsunami of negative publicity over such a long time\" did not feel they were losing control of their life and destiny.Heavy court restrictions have been imposed on the trial, with a ban on photos of the defendant or the women he is alleged to have raped inside or outside court. While much of the first day was open to reporters, the doors were closed for the trial to hear from the first woman to give evidence in the case.Paul Kirby/BBCDefence counsel Ellen Holager Andenæs said Marius Borg Høiby was a young man who deserved a fair trialA small number of journalists were allowed to follow proceedings in an adjoining room, and details of the young woman's evidence have emerged from their accounts.Describing the situation as surreal and overwhelming, she said it was unfair she was being dragged into the criminal case and it was the last thing she wanted. The alleged events took place in 2018 and it was not until after the defendant's arrest in 2024 that police found videos on his phone.She told the court that they had consensual sex for a few seconds before she put an end to it. Then she said there was a \"big black hole\" in her memory. Asked if she had fallen asleep afterwards, she was adamant that she had not.Her testimony is due to continue on Wednesday. All four of the women were incapacitated at the time of the alleged rapes. The alleged incidents took place after consensual sex.Marius Borg Høiby's defence counsel told the court that he had pleaded not guilty to rape because he saw all the incidents as \"completely normal and voluntary sexual relations\".She said the court would need to decide whether the four women had been unable to prevent what had happened, and if he should have understood that they were asleep or unable to resist.The defendant will return to court on Wednesday. He will spend the first four weeks of the trial in custody, as he was arrested two days before it began on suspicion of assault, making threats with a knife and violating a restraining order.The case will be decided by three judges - if they find him guilty, he could go to jail for at least 10 years. The trial comes at an intensely difficult time for the royal family because of the continuing scandal surrounding the crown princess's correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein.Norway's royal family remains very popular, with a Norstat opinion poll not long ago suggesting 73% were in favour of it.But there are signs of disquiet among Norwegians from snap polls this week.One survey by the Verdens Gang website suggested that its popularity was down to 60.9%. The same poll also suggested 44% of Norwegians believed Mette-Marit should not become queen.The palace sees opinion polls as snapshots that change over time, and it will have been comforted by a vote by Norwegian MPs as the trial got under way.Traditionally, they vote once in every parliament on a republican motion to abolish the monarchy and the motion came up by coincidence on Tuesday. The result was never in doubt - and only 26 of the 169 members of the Storting supported abolition.",

    "body": "House shelves contempt vote as Clintons agree to testify in Epstein investigation3 hours agoSakshi VenkatramanWatch: Why is no one being prosecuted over the Epstein files?Former US President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State, have agreed to testify in the congressional investigation into late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, allowing them to avoid being found in contempt of Congress.The House of Representatives had been poised to vote this week on holding the couple in contempt for refusing to appear before the chamber's Oversight Committee.Bill Clinton was acquainted with Epstein, who died in prison in 2019, but has denied knowledge of his sex offending and says he cut off contact two decades ago. He will appear for a deposition on 27 February, and Hillary Clinton will appear the day before.It will be the first time a former US president has testified to a congressional panel since Gerald Ford did so in 1983.The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has asked for the depositions to be filmed and transcribed, with no time limit. On Tuesday, House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman James Comer said: \"Once it became clear that we would hold them in contempt, the Clintons completely caved.\"\"Republicans and Democrats on the Oversight Committee have been clear: no one is above the law - and that includes the Clintons,\" he added in a statement. The House was expected to vote this week on holding the former president and former secretary of state in criminal contempt of Congress, but the plans were abruptly put on hold on Monday as the Clintons' legal team said they would agree to the committee's terms.The couple, both Democrats, had previously struck a defiant tone, saying they had already submitted sworn statements covering the \"limited information\" they had on Epstein.They had dismissed the legal summonses issued by the panel as \"nothing more than a ploy to attempt to embarrass political rivals, as President Trump has directed\".The oversight committee then approved a measure to hold the Clintons in contempt late last month, with the support of several Democrats.On Saturday, as a vote in the full House loomed, lawyers for the Clintons made an offer to provide limited testimony that would have centred on a four-hour interview by Bill Clinton. But Comer expressed concerns that the former president would stonewall questions and run down the clock.On Monday evening, Bill Clinton's Deputy Chief of Staff Angel Ureña posted on X confirming the couple would appear before the panel.\"They negotiated in good faith,\" Ureña wrote in a tweet directed at the House Oversight Committee. \"You did not. \"They told you under oath what they know, but you don't care. But the former President and former Secretary of State will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.\"If the House had approved a contempt resolution, it would have been referred to the justice department, which then could have decided whether to prosecute the Clintons.Neither Clinton has been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein's abuse, and they have denied knowledge of his sex offending.Hillary Clinton, former US senator and secretary of state, and the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016, has said she never met or spoke to Epstein.US Department of JusticeBill Clinton in a hot tub, in the Epstein filesEpstein's private jet logs show that Clinton took four international flights in 2002 and 2003.Shortly after Epstein was arrested on sex trafficking charges in July 2019, Clinton's spokesperson said the former president took trips on the plane including \"stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation\".The former president also appears at the late financier's estate in photos that were among a batch of records released by the justice department to comply with a law passed by Congress mandating the disclosure of all investigative material relating to the late convicted paedophile.One picture shows the former president swimming in a pool, and another shows him lying on his back with his hands behind his head in what appears to be a hot tub.Ureña, Clinton's spokesman, said at the time the photos were released in December that they were decades old and Clinton had stopped associating with Epstein before his crimes came to light.Watch: What's in the latest batch of released Epstein files?Last month, the Clintons wrote a letter to Comer criticising his handling of the Epstein investigation. \"The decisions you have made, and the priorities you have set as chairman regarding the Epstein investigation, have prevented progress in discovering the facts about the government's role,\" the letter said. They added: \"There is no plausible explanation for what you are doing other than partisan politics.\"",

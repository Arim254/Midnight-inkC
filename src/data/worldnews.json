    "body": "1 day agoFrank GardnerSecurity correspondentBBCRussia's full-scale war on Ukraine will soon enter its fifth year. Mysterious incidents of so-called \"hybrid warfare\" are mounting in Europe, increasing tensions. And in the UK, military chiefs have warned we must prepare for war if we want to avoid it. But if the unthinkable happened, and war with Russia broke out, could the UK fight for more than just a few weeks?Listen to Frank reading this article\"We are not planning to go to war with Europe. But if Europe wants to, and starts, we are ready right now.\" So said Russian President Vladimir Putin on 2 December, accusing European countries of hindering US efforts to bring peace in Ukraine.To be clear, it is extremely unlikely that the UK would ever find itself in a war with Russia on its own, unsupported by Nato allies. But Putin's words were an uncomfortable reminder that a war between Russia and Nato countries, including the UK, was not as remote as people hoped.How war could look in the tech-age\"Well that's odd. I've got no signal on my phone.\" \"Me neither. I'm offline. What's going on?\" That scenario, hypothetically, is just one way we could know that a war with Russia had begun, or was about to. (I should add that there can also be other, perfectly benign, reasons for a loss of signal.)That signal interruption could be followed by an inability to make bank payments for essentials like food and fuel. Food distribution would be disrupted, electricity supplies compromised.AFP via Getty Images'We are not planning to go to war with Europe. But if Europe wants to, and starts, we are ready right now,' Putin has saidThere are many ways of fighting a war, and not just the physically destructive wave of drones, bombs and missiles so tragically familiar to the citizens of Ukraine.Our modern, tech-driven society is highly dependent on the network of undersea cables and pipelines that connect the UK to the rest of the world, carrying data, financial transactions and energy. Covert activity by Russian spy vessels, such as the Yantar, is widely believed to have scoped out these cables for potential sabotage in a time of war, which is why the Royal Navy has recently invested in a fleet of underwater drones equipped with integrated sensors.In a war, these hidden, unseen actions, combined with an almost inevitable attempt to \"blind\" Western satellites in space, would seriously hamper the UK's ability to fight, as well as potentially wreaking havoc on civil society.Getty ImagesIn the UK, military chiefs have warned we must prepare for war if we want to avoid itAt a recent conference in London entitled Fighting the Long War, organised by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), a Whitehall think tank, military and political figures came together to discuss whether the UK's current armed forces would be in a position to sustain a protracted conflict before they ran out of everything from troops, to ammunition to spare parts.\"There remains little evidence that the UK has a plan to fight a war lasting more than a few weeks,\" argues Rusi's Hamish Mundell. \"Medical capacity is limited. Reserve regeneration pipelines are slow… The British plan for mass casualty outcomes appears to be based on not taking casualties.\" With classic British understatement, he says: \"This could be considered an optimistic planning assumption.\"He adds that to fight a long war you need proper back-up. \"It demands a second and even third echelon; personnel, platforms and logistics chains that can absorb losses and continue the fight. Yet this depth is notably absent from current British force design.\"Russia's 'low quality' army\"There are shortfalls in ammunition, artillery, vehicles, air defence, and people, with limited to no ability to regenerate units or casualties,\" says Justin Crump, CEO of Sibylline, a private intelligence company.Two of the biggest military lessons to come out of the Ukraine war are firstly, that drones are now integral to modern warfare, at every level, and secondly, that \"mass\", or sheer volume of personnel and military hardware, matters.Getty Images'There are shortfalls in ammunition, artillery, vehicles, air defence, and people, with limited to no ability to regenerate units or casualties,' says Justin CrumpRussia's army is generally of a very low quality. Its soldiers are poorly equipped, poorly led and poorly fed. Their life expectancy in the deadly \"drone zone\" of eastern Ukraine is short. UK Defence Intelligence estimates that since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022 Russia's army has suffered more than 1.1 million casualties – that is killed, wounded, captured or missing. Even conservative estimates put the number of Russians killed at 150,000. Ukraine has also suffered catastrophic casualties but numbers are hard to ascertain.But Russia has been able to draw on such a massive pool of manpower that it has so far been able to replace its estimated 30,000 monthly battlefield casualties with fresh blood. Russia's economy has also been on a war footing for more than three years now: an economist has been placed in charge of the Defence Ministry, while its factories churn out ever more supplies of drones, missiles and artillery shells. According to a recent report by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, Russia has been producing each month around 150 tanks, 550 infantry fighting vehicles, 120 Lancet drones and more than 50 artillery pieces.The UK, and most of its Western allies, are simply not anywhere near this point. EPA/ShutterstockUkraine has suffered catastrophic casualties but numbers are hard to ascertainAnalysts say it would take years for Western Europe's factories to come close to matching Russia's mass-production of weapons.\"The land war in Ukraine has shown beyond doubt that mass is absolutely vital for anybody that is going to face Russia on land,\" says Keir Giles, a Russia expert at Chatham House think tank. \"And having deep reserves vastly greater in number than the standing regular armed forces has been shown to be essential.\"How national service conversations backfiredFrance and Germany have both recently moved to revive a system of voluntary military service for 18-year-olds. The UK's former Head of the Army, Gen Sir Patrick Sanders, suggested in 2024, the year he retired, that the UK should train what he called \"a citizen army\" to fight a land war in the future. The idea was shot down by No. 10.\"I think it's a cultural thing within the UK,\" says Ed Arnold, senior research fellow at Rusi. \"So if you look at the states that are now looking towards [military service] - like Sweden, Germany and France - they are states who culturally still have an institutional memory of when they had that system. \"We haven't had national service since the 1960s and attempts to have that national conversation around it have pretty much backfired.\"AFP via Getty ImagesFrance has recently moved to revive a system of voluntary military service for 18-year olds\"The reality is, our armed forces cannot survive on a diet of government spin, over-the-horizon spending commitments and hollow rhetoric,\" Sir Ben Wallace, who was Defence Secretary in the Conservative government from 2019 to 2023, told the BBC.Responding to this, a spokesperson for the current Labour Defence Secretary, John Healey, told me: \"This characterisation is baseless. \"We increased defence spending by £5bn this year alone, signed 1,000 major contracts since the election and increased MOD spending with British businesses by 6% above inflation in the last year.\"He points to a new defence agreement with Norway, a £300m new investment in the Royal Navy's laser weapon and a £9bn investment into armed forces housing, adding: \"We're a government investing in the transformation of our forces, investing in our British service personnel... to create jobs and growth in Britain's communities.\"Getty ImagesGermany has also introduced voluntary military service for 18 year-oldsBut this is not about party politics. It's about whether UK defence has been under-funded for so long that it has now reached the point where the country is dangerously vulnerable in several areas, notably air defence.There are also problems of timing and inefficiency. Defence contracts often take years to come to fruition. Billions of pounds have been spent on Ajax, an overdue armoured vehicle project still beset with problems. Meanwhile, Nato officers have been warning Russia could be in a position to launch an attack on a Nato country within three to five years.At the end of the Cold War (between Nato and the Soviet Union) in 1990, when I was a young infantry Captain in the Army Reserves, the UK was spending 4.1% of GDP on defence. The following year it deployed over 45,000 troops to help evict Iraq President Saddam Hussein's invading army from Kuwait in operation Desert Storm. More from InDepthToday, with multiple pressures on the economy, the government is striving to meet a target of 2.5% of GDP by 2027, while Russia spends close to 7%.On paper, the British Army numbers around 74,000 but Rusi's Ed Arnold points out that once you subtract medically non-deployable soldiers, defence attaches around the world and others not part of formed units, then its actual deployable strength is only 54,000. That is less than the average number of casualties Russia takes in two months in Ukraine.In the event of a war, says Justin Crump of Sibylline, on land the (British) Army would most likely be degraded – incapable of fighting effectively - within weeks, once committed, though he adds \"much depends on the form of the conflict\".Suggestions the UK is already 'at war'Some commentators have suggested that the UK is already \"at war\" with Russia. They are referring to what is known as \"hybrid\" or \"grey-zone\" warfare, which includes events that are often deniable, such as cyber-attacks, disinformation and the alleged launching of drones close to airports and military bases in Nato countries.But worrying as these are, they pale compared to the crisis that would be triggered by a Russian military attack on a Nato country, especially if it involved seizing territory and people being killed.Getty ImagesA Eurofighter TyphoonThere are several potential flashpoints here, where Nato military chiefs fear that Putin, if he were allowed to achieve his aims in Ukraine, could eventually move on to seek new targets for aggression.One potential target is the Suwalki Gap, a 60-mile (100km) stretch of border between Poland and Lithuania, both Nato countries. This is all that separates Russian ally Belarus from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic coast. Seizing that border and opening up a route along it would, in theory, give Moscow direct access to its strategic base on the Baltic.The Baltic states themselves are other potential flashpoints. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were all once part of the Soviet Union and were ruled from Moscow. They all voted for independence and have since joined Nato, but all have Russian-speaking minorities and hence there is a risk that Mr Putin could be tempted to send his troops across the border \"to protect them from persecution\".The eastern Estonian town of Narva, for example, is an obvious potential target here, as the majority of its population speak Russian and it sits just across the river from the giant Russian fortress of Ivangorod. A UK battle group comprising some 900 British military personnel has been stationed in Estonia, about 80 miles west of Narva, since 2017. AFP via Gettty ImagesThe eastern Estonian town of Narva sits just across the river from the giant Russian fortress of IvangorodIn the event of war, the plan goes, it would be hurriedly reinforced to brigade strength of around 3,000 or more.Another possible flashpoint is the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, which is administered by Norway but where Moscow already has a toehold in the coal mining town of Barentsburg.Litvinenko, Skripal and hostile acts on UK soilThe UK may well be Putin's enemy number one, having been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies, and having pushed for more powerful weapons to be delivered to help its defence.Hostile acts on UK soil that have been linked to President Putin include the murder with radioactive Polonium-210 of former KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 - a public inquiry concluded that Putin \"probably\" approved his assassination - and the attempted murder of former Russian military intelligence officer turned MI6 agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018, using the nerve agent, Novichok.Dawn Sturgess, a mother-of-three, later died after she sprayed the Novichok, disguised as perfume, on her wrists. Putin was \"morally responsible\" for her death, an inquiry concluded last week. Lord Anthony Hughes, the inquiry chair, said: \"I have concluded that the operation to assassinate Sergei Skripal must have been authorised at the highest level, by President Putin.\"Russia, which has always denied involvement in the attacks and suggested more than 20 different possible explanations for Ms Sturgess's death, described the report's findings as \"tasteless fairy tales\".Sputnik/ AFP via Getty ImagesPutin accused European countries of hindering US efforts to bring peace in UkraineBut the UK is also a core member of the Nato alliance. While questions are certainly raised in private over the reliability of the current US administration in the White House, it is hard to envisage the UK ever having to fight Russia on its own.\"A pure UK-Russia conflict is not likely and can be disregarded, practically,\" says Mr Crump. \"We would definitely fight with allies, although Russia would most likely only launch a conflict if it felt Nato would break.\"The wild card here is US President Donald Trump. While the chairman of Nato's Military Committee, Adm Cavo Dragone recently assured me that the US president was absolutely committed to defending the Nato alliance, others are not so sure. Would Trump, for example, go to war to defend the Estonian town of Narva?Getty ImagesIt is extremely unlikely that the UK would ever find itself in a war with Russia on its own, unsupported by Nato allies\"There is no one-size-fits-all answer to what the United Kingdom is actually capable of,\" concludes Keir Giles of Chatham House, \"because there are so many different situations under which it could be challenged by Russia.\"As a society, the UK – unlike Poland, Finland and the Baltic States – is unquestionably not ready for war. Even serious preparations for such an eventuality would be both expensive, unpopular and politically risky.But Mr Giles of Chatham House offers some sobering advice to the British public: \"Recognise that the rights and freedoms and prosperity that they take for granted are in fact under threat and that freedom does not come for free.\"\"And understand that lives will have to change. And this is not the fault of the current government or even its predecessors — it's their fault that it is so expensive, but the root cause of the problem is in Moscow.\"Top image credit: Ministry of Defence /PA Wire/ Getty Images.

    "body": "At least 34 people have died and dozens more are injured after air strikes from Myanmar's military hit a hospital in the country's west on Wednesday night, according to ground sources.The hospital is located in Mrauk-U town in Rakhine state, an area controlled by the Arakan Army - one of the strongest ethnic armies fighting the country's military regime.Thousands have died and millions have been displaced since the military seized power in a coup in 2021 and triggered a civil war.In recent months, the military has intensified air strikes to take back territory from ethnic armies. It has also deployed paragliders to drop bombs on its enemies.The Myanmar military has not commented on the strikes, which come as the country prepares to vote later this month in its first election since the coup.However, pro-military accounts on Telegram claim the strikes this week were not aimed at civilians.Khaing Thukha, a spokesperson for the Arakan Army, told the BBC that most of the casualties were patients at the hospital.\"This is the latest vicious attack by the terrorist military targeting civilian places,\" he said, adding that the military \"must take responsibility\" for bombing civilians.The Arakan Army health department said the strike, which occurred at around 21:00 (14:30 GMT), killed 10 patients on the spot and injured many others.Photos believed to be from the scene have been circulating on social media showing missing roofs across parts of the building complex, broken hospital beds and debris strewn across the ground.The junta has been locked in a years-long bloody conflict with ethnic militias, at one point losing control of more than half the country.But recent influx of technology and equipment from China and Russia seems to have helped it turn the tide. The junta has made significant gains through a campaign of airstrikes and heavy bombardment. Earlier this year, more than 20 people were killed after an army motorised paraglider dropped two bombs on a crowd protesting at a religious festival.Civil liberties have also shrunk dramatically under the junta. Tens of thousands of political dissidents have been arrested, rights groups estimate.Myanmar's junta has called for a general election on 28 December, touting it as a pathway to political stability. But critics say the election will be neither free nor fair, but will instead offer the junta a guise of legitimacy. Tom Andrews, the United Nations' human rights expert on Myanmar, has called it a \"sham election\".In recent weeks the junta has arrested civilians accused of disrupting the vote, including one man who authorities said had sent out anti-election messages on Facebook.The junta also said on Monday that it was looking for 10 activists involved in an anti-election protest.Ethnic armies and other opposition groups have pledged to boycott the polls.At least one election candidate in in central Myanmar's Magway Region was detained by an anti-junta group, the Associated Press reported.",

    "body": "The number of Indigenous people who have died in custody in Australia has hit the highest level since records began in 1980.New data from the Australian Institute of Criminology showed 33 of the 113 people who died in custody in the 12 months to June this year were Indigenous, up from 24 compared to the previous corresponding period.Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system, making up more than one-third of all prisoners, despite being less than four per cent of the country's population.The figures come more than three decades after a landmark inquiry into Indigenous deaths in custody which made hundreds of recommendations.Of the 33 Indigenous deaths in custody between last July and this June, 26 died while in prison custody, an increase from 18 in the previous 12-month period.One died in youth detention and all except one were male. The remaining six Indigenous deaths in custody happened in police custody, where someone has died while police were detaining or attempting to detain them.The main cause of Indigenous deaths was categorised as \"self-inflicted\" followed by \"natural causes,\" the report found. Hanging was found to be the cause in eight of the deaths.The Australian state of New South Wales recorded the highest number of Indigenous deaths in prison custody with nine, followed by Western Australia with six. Queensland, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory each had three deaths.The NSW state coroner recently described the rising number of Indigenous deaths in custody in her state as a \"profoundly distressing milestone\".In October, Magistrate Teresa O'Sullivan said the upward trend was not \"mere statistics\" and the deaths needed \"independent and careful scrutiny, respect and accountability\".The average age of Indigenous deaths in custody was 45 years, and 11 of those who died were awaiting a sentence.University of Melbourne associate professor of criminal law Amanda Porter told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that the figures reflected a \"national crisis\" that required \"leadership and political action\".Ms Porter, who has attended several coronial inquests with families of those that have died, said little had changed since the royal commission in 1991 that aimed to address the crisis.\"It's maddening to see the number of inquests that I attend, the number of funerals that families have to attend, and the fact that we are 30 years after the royal commission, and the situation is getting increasingly worse,\" she told the ABC.Since the royal commission, 600 Indigenous people have died in custody which includes six in youth detention, the report said.",

    "body": "Two brothers wanted in connection with a deadly fire at their nightclub in India's Goa state, which killed 25 people, have been detained in Thailand, India's ambassador to Thailand, Nagesh Singh, told the BBC.Gaurav and Saurabh Luthra, who own Birch By Romeo Lane club, fled to Phuket, shortly after the incident earlier this week. \"They will be sent back [to India],\" Mr Singh said on Thursday, a day after a court in Delhi refused to grant them protection from arrest and the Goa government approached India's external affairs ministry to revoke their passports.The brothers have not made any public statements, but their lawyer told the court that they were being made victims of a \"witch hunt\". The incident took place early on Sunday, when a deadly blaze broke out at the club in a busy nightlife area of the tourist state.Investigators believe the fire was triggered by fireworks being set off inside the venue.Most of the victims were staff members, while five were tourists.Investigators say they raided the brothers' Delhi home hours after the fire but found they had fled the country. Police then sought Interpol's help to track them.Saurabh Luthra, whose social media identifies him as the chairman of the company which operates the club, posted a statement on social media on Monday expressing \"profound grief\".\"The management stands in unwavering solidarity with the families of the deceased as well as those injured,\" he wrote, adding that the nightclub's management would provide \"assistance, support and cooperation to the bereaved\".On Wednesday, Goa's Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said the police has arrested six persons in connection with the incident so far, adding that \"more arrests will be made soon\".Goa is a former Portuguese colony on the Arabian Sea. Its nightlife, sandy beaches, and resorts attract millions of tourists annually.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "3 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterMexican lawmakers have approved a package of new tariffs, impacting hundreds of products, many of which come from China.The measures, which President Claudia Sheinbaum has said are needed to boost domestic production, were passed by the Mexican Senate on Wednesday.The levies are set to take effect on 1 January 2026 and will apply to goods like metals, cars, clothing and appliances. Dozens of countries that do not have a free trade agreement with Mexico will be affected, including Thailand, India and Indonesia.The move comes as Mexico is in negotiations with the US over steep import taxes that President Donald Trump has threatened to impose on the country.The measures will impose tariffs of up to 50% on more than 1,400 products.The levies will \"substantially harm the interests of trading partners, including China,\" said a spokesperson for Beijing's commerce ministry on Thursday.An investigation into Mexico's trade policy is in progress, they added, urging the country to \"correct\" its decision.This week, China also signalled its plans for more involvement with Latin American and Caribbean countries, as it aims to deepen its relationships in the region through trade and innovation.Chinese companies have been expanding their footprint in Mexico in recent years, with car brands like BYD and MG establishing operations in the country.But Washington has said Beijing may be using Mexico as a way to bypass US tariffs.The BBC has contacted the embassies in Mexico of Thailand, India and Indonesia for comment.Sheinbaum's government is in talks with the Trump administration as it tries to reduce tariffs that the White House has threatened to impose on the country. They include potential 50% duties on Mexican steel and aluminium.Trump has also threatened to impose extra tariffs on Mexico for various reasons, including a 25% levy as part of Washington's measures to pressure countries to do more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into America.On Monday, Trump threatened to impose a new 5% tariff on Mexico, accusing it of violating an agreement that gives American farmers access to water.\"It is very unfair to our US Farmers who deserve this much needed water,\" he posted on social media.Trump was referring to a more than 80-year-old treaty that grants the US water from Rio Grande tributaries.For decades the US has accused Mexico of not meeting the terms of the agreement.The US is Mexico's largest trading partner.",

    "body": "A Japanese chess association has apologised to a prominent shogi player who criticised a rule that bars pregnant players from title matches around their expected due dates.Under the current rules of shogi - a game similar to chess - such players are replaced, meaning they forfeit all competitions and potential titles during that time.Kana Fukuma, one of Japan's most decorated shogi players, says this forces players to choose between having a child and developing their careers, and \"significantly restricts reproductive rights\".\"I hope the body will consider allowing female players to take time off before their due dates without suffering demotion,\" she told a news conference on Wednesday.Current rules stipulate that a pregnant women cannot compete within a 14-week period - from six weeks before they give birth, to eight weeks after.\"I hesitated to have a child while pursuing my career in shogi, which is everything to me,\" Ms Fukuma said, according to Japan's Kyodo News. The 33-year-old has been playing the popular Japanese board game professionally since 2003. Before giving birth to her first child in December 2024, however, Ms Fukuma was forced to withdraw from several tournaments due to health issues related to her pregnancy.In a written request submitted on Tuesday, Ms Fukuma urged the association to adjust match dates or venues to accommodate pregnant players, allow competition during pregnancy if the woman's condition allows for it, and ensure women are not stripped of titles during their maternity leave, Kyodo News reported.The association said it could revise the rules after \"discussions with experts while considering the safety of the mother and the fairness of title matches\". This exchange between Ms Fukuma and the shogi association drew mixed responses on social media, with some calling the current rules \"misogynistic\" and others drawing comparisons to professional sports tournaments.On Reddit, one user pointed out that tennis players are sometimes given \"protected rankings\", which allow those returning from long injuries or maternity leave to use their previous rankings to enter major tournaments, including the Grand Slam.",

    "body": "7 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterPresident Donald Trump has launched a scheme offering fast-tracked US visas to wealthy foreigners who can pay at least $1m (£750,000).The card will give buyers a \"direct path to Citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. SO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent,\" Trump said on social media on Wednesday.The Trump Gold Card, which was first announced earlier this year, is a US visa awarded to those who can demonstrate they will provide a \"substantial benefit\" to the country, according to the scheme's official website.It comes as Washington intensifies its immigration crackdown, including raising work visa fees and deporting undocumented migrants.The Gold Card scheme promises US residency in \"record time\" and will require a $1m fee which is \"evidence that the individual will substantially benefit the United States\", the programme's website said.Businesses sponsoring employees are required to pay $2m, along with additional fees. A \"platinum\" version of the card that offers special tax breaks will also be available soon for $5m, the website said.Extra fees to the government may be charged depending on each applicant's circumstances, the site said. Individuals are also required to pay a non-refundable $15,000 processing fee before their application is reviewed.The gold card scheme has faced criticism since it was first announced in February, with some Democrats saying that it would unfairly favour wealthy individuals.When Trump first unveiled the plan he described the visas as similar to green cards, which allow immigrants of various income levels to live and work permanently in the US. Green card holders typically become eligible for citizenship after five years.But the Gold Card is aimed specifically at \"high-level\" professionals, Trump said, emphasising, \"we want people that are productive\".\"The people that can pay $5m, they're going to create jobs,\" Trump said. \"It's going to sell like crazy. It's a bargain.\"The scheme comes as the Trump administration has devoted significant resources to deporting immigrants.The US has also paused immigration applications by individuals from the 19 countries, mostly in Africa and in the Middle East, which are subject to the president's travel ban.The government has also halted all decisions on asylum applications and said it would review thousands of cases that were approved under the administration of President Joe Biden.In September, Trump also signed an order to charge a $100,000 fee for applicants of the H-1B visa programme for skilled foreign workers. The decision caused panic among overseas student in the US and technology firms. The White House later clarified that the fee would apply only to new applicants who are currently abroad.",

    "body": "At least 22 people have been killed and a further 16 injured after two buildings collapsed in the Moroccan city of Fez.The two four-storey residential buildings that came down early on Wednesday morning contained eight families, state media reports, citing local officials.Several Moroccan news outlets report that the buildings - located in the south-westerly Al Massira suburb of the new part of the city - had shown signs of deterioration for several years. An investigation is now under way.Fez, in north-eastern Morocco, is one of the North African nation's oldest cities, with parts dating back to the 8th Century, as well as being its third-most populous.A search and rescue operation is ongoing to find anyone who may still be trapped under the rubble. Footage from the scene shows people and diggers sifting through the debris under the cover of darkness.In one clip, published by news site Akhbarona, a body can be seen being carried away on a stretcher by emergency services.Residents of nearby buildings have been evacuated as a preventative measure, state media reports.Those taken to hospital suffered varying injuries.The public prosecutor's office in Fez said one of the buildings had been empty but that the other had been hosting a celebration for the birth of a child when the incident occurred, state media reports.It has now opened an investigation into the cause and circumstances of the collapse, local media reports. Residents were quick to blame haphazard construction.\"People shouldn't keep building and encroaching on the next building [over],\" one of them, Abdelali, told Hespress, adding that one of the buildings had fallen onto the other.Another, Idris, said the whole incident had occurred in less than two minutes.\"It was a sudden thing,\" he told the news site. \"We were shocked, we couldn't sleep, we ran away from our homes and went outside.\"Fez was among Moroccan cities caught up in youth-led anti-government protests a few months back, with improved housing and infrastructure among demonstrators' demands.The country's housing minister Adib Ben Ibrahim said in January that around 13,700 buildings nationwide were under imminent risk of collapse.Nine were killed when a condemned building collapsed in a different neighbourhood of Fez in May.Prior to that, five people were killed when a house in the old city crumbled in February 2024, following heavy rain and strong winds.",

    "body": "15 hours agoAoife WalshWashingtonReutersA federal judge in New York has ruled the US Department of Justice can publicly release grand jury records from Jeffrey Epstein's 2019 sex trafficking case. US District Judge Richard Berman's ruling reverses his previous decision to keep the material sealed. He cited a new law passed by Congress requiring the justice department to release files about Epstein.In his latest ruling, Judge Berman said the victims have the right to \"have their identity and privacy protected\", adding that their \"safety and privacy are paramount\".Esptein was charged with sex trafficking in July 2019. He died in a New York prison cell a month later while awaiting trail. Judge Berman in August had denied the justice department's request because of concerns about \"possible threats to victims' safety and privacy\".But in Wednesday's ruling, he said the materials could now be released because of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which was signed into law by US President Donald Trump last month.The law requires the justice department to release investigative material related to Epstein by 19 December, including unclassified records, documents and communications.It also allows the department to withhold files that involve active criminal investigations or raise privacy concerns.Judge Berman is the third federal judge to grant similar requests from the justice department since the new law was introduced. On Tuesday, another judge made a similar ruling in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 for her role in facilitating Epstein's abuse.During her trial, prosecutors argued Maxwell recruited and groomed girls, some as young as 14, between 1994 and 2004, before they were abused by Epstein. She is serving a 20-year sentence. Last Friday, a judge in Florida granted a different request to unseal grand jury transcripts from another investigation into Epstein from 2005 and 2007. Getty ImagesA judge made a similar ruling in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell on TuesdayThe Trump administration has faced months of pressure over the Epstein files. The president was a friend of Epstein's, but has said they fell out in the early 2000s, years before the disgraced financier was first arrested. Trump has denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. During the 2024 presidential campaign, he promised to make the files public, and early in the year his administration released thousands of pages of documents from the Epstein investigation – mostly flight logs. However, justice department officials in July said in a memo no further material would be released. That prompted anger from within both parties, and lawmakers introduced a resolution forcing the files' release.Trump, who previously dismissed calls to release the files, signed the bill into law in November marking a major reversal in his position. The family of Virginia Giuffre, an Epstein victim who died by suicide earlier this year, said Trump signing the bill was \"nothing short of monumental\".The files which must be made public this month are different to the documents released by the House Oversight Committee, which had subpoenaed Epstein's estate earlier in the year.US CongressImages were recently released by a congressional committee showing Epstein's home in the US Virgin IslandsThose documents included images of Jeffrey Epstein's US Virgin Islands home, which showed several bedrooms, a room with masks on a wall and a phone with names written on speed-dial buttons.Multiple survivors have alleged that they were trafficked to and abused on the island, known as Little St James, which Epstein purchased in 1998.The images from 2020 also showed what appeared to be a dental chair, and another room that had a black chalkboard on the wall with the words \"truth\", \"deception\" and \"power\" scrawled across it. The committee's Democratic leader, Robert Garcia, said the material was released to \"ensure public transparency\".Republicans, who are in the majority on the committee, criticised Democrats for releasing selective information in advance and then released a further batch of documents.",

    "body": "8 hours agoYuna Ku,BBC KoreanandKoh EweGetty ImagesPark Na-rae, one of the country's most successful female comedians, has now left her popular variety shows amid allegations of workplace bullyingIn a matter of days, three big names in South Korea's entertainment industry have made headlines in separate scandals that could derail their careers.The allegations that have embroiled comedians Park Na-rae and Cho Sae-ho, as well as veteran actor Cho Jin-woong, are all different - ranging from workplace abuse to previous teenage detention to associations with a gang member.But the results have been the same: departures from the television screens where they had worked their way up to become household names.The scandals have also raised questions about the standards to which South Korea's public figures are held - especially in the entertainment industry.What are the scandals about?Park Na-rae, one of the country's most successful female comedians, made headlines last week when two of her former managers lodged criminal complaints claiming she had verbally abused and physically assaulted them.The 40-year-old had also made them do her personal chores, they alleged.Park has denied these allegations and sued the former managers for blackmail, her agency said over the weekend.She is separately being accused of receiving IV drips illegally at home, which violates the local medical law, local media reported - prompting a police investigation.On Monday, Park Na-rae announced on social media that she had talked things through with her accusers, but would halt all broadcasting activities until things were \"clearly resolved\".\"As a comedian whose job is to bring laughter and joy, I cannot continue to be a burden to my programmes and colleagues,\" she wrote on social media.Getty ImagesCho Sae-ho came under fire for his alleged links to a local gang memberAnother comedian who has come under scrutiny over the past week is Cho Sae-ho.Rumours started swirling last week that the 43-year-old was friends with a prominent local gang member and had received money to promote the latter's business.Backlash came swiftly, as social media users demanded that Cho Sae-ho be removed from the popular variety shows he hosted, You Quiz on the Block and Two Days and One Night.On Tuesday, Cho Sae-ho's agency announced that he would leave the shows - though it denied his links to the gang's business activities.In a social media statement, Cho Sae-ho said he \"should have been more careful\" with the people he met at events.He added that he had decided to step down from the shows because he did not want to \"burden\" the programmes and their production teams.The downfall that has generated the most debate comes from veteran actor Cho Jin-woong, who said over the weekend that he would quit acting.Getty ImagesCho Jin-woong announced his retirement from acting amid allegations of robbery and sexual assault as a teenThe abrupt announcement came after a viral news report that said Cho Jin-woong, as a teenager in the 1990s, had been sent to a juvenile detention centre on allegations of robbery and sexual assault. As an adult, he also assaulted a person in his theatre troupe and had his driving licence suspended for drink driving, the report said.The 49-year-old's agency said that Cho Jin-woong had confirmed wrongdoing in his youth, but denied sexually assaulting anyone.Broadcasters have scrambled to erase Cho Jin-woong from their platforms. A documentary series he narrated has now had the narration re-recorded, while the fate of Second Signal, the sequel to his hit TV series, remains unclear.A debate over cancel cultureThe allegations Cho Jin-woong faces have stirred heated debate about how much public figures should be forgiven for past mistakes.\"Why does Cho Jin-woong need to retire?\" reads one social media comment. \"Why should a flawed past remain the standard by which a person is judged decades later?\"Others, however, have argued that seeing him on screen could retraumatise his past victims.\"There are people who defend [Cho Jin-woong] by saying everyone makes mistakes when they're young, but not everyone commits this level of crime,\" wrote one social media user.More broadly, the recent string of celebrity scandals has raised bigger questions about the standards to which South Koreans hold their celebrities. It's a system that has sent rising stars into hiatus for being school bullies, and squeezed apologies out of them for simply dating other celebrities.Culture critic Kim Sung-soo tells the BBC that in South Korea, audiences want to correct behaviour that they deem unacceptable - which, in the case of celebrities, often means disappearing from the screens.\"Celebrities are easy targets because their careers depend on reputation and popularity - things that are granted by the public,\" culture critic Kim Sung-soo tells the BBC.Now, just as Park, Cho Sae-ho and Cho Jin-woong promised to \"reflect deeply\" on their actions, it appears some among their audiences are also reflecting on how celebrities are treated.\"It's absurd that people mistake this recurring pattern of targeting celebrities online - digging for flaws and pushing them out - as a moral issue,\" one person wrote on X.\"I'm tired of this cancel-culture cycle, and I think it's time for our society to seriously rethink online communities.\"",

    "body": "Portugal is facing severe disruption to transport, flights, hospitals, schools and other public services on Thursday, as the two main union federations stage a general strike over unprecedented labour reforms.The last time the CGTP and the generally less militant UGT joined forces was during the eurozone debt crisis in 2013, when a \"troika\" of international institutions demanded cuts in salaries and pensions as part of Portugal's bailout.Twelve years later, Portugal's economy has become the fastest growing in the eurozone in recent months, but Prime Minister Luís Montenegro says it is still necessary to tackle \"rigidities\" in the labour market \"so companies can be more profitable and workers have better salaries\" as a result.\"I will not give up on having a country with the ambition to be at the forefront, to be at the vanguard of Europe,\" he said on the eve of the strike.However, Montenegro appears to have been taken aback by the strength of feeling against his minority right-of-centre government's plans: one of his Social Democrat MPs is on the UGT executive and even he voted for a strike.The prime minister tweaked some proposals after calling the federation in for talks late last month, but it was clearly not enough.Among the most controversial of the more than 100 proposals are:letting employers roll over temporary contracts for years on endlifting a ban on sacking workers then immediately rehiring them indirectly via outsourcingremoving a requirement to reinstate employees who were unfairly dismissed.It is Portuguese in their 20s who are likely to be most affected by the changes - and opinion is rather mixed.Diogo Brito, who works as an air steward but has friends who do casual work in tourism, supports the right to strike but backs the package: \"It has to be done. We have to catch up with richer countries and with these measures I think we can evolve more.\"But self-employed photographer Eduardo Ferreira says he knows many people who already cannot find secure jobs and is pleased to see the unions unite at a \"critical moment\" for Portugal: \"Things have been tough ever since the troika, and workers haven't reacted until now.\"The CGTP has condemned the package as \"an assault on the rights of all workers, particularly women and young people\", while the UGT calls it \"so out of step, in a context of economic growth, financial stability and a strong labour market, that… it reflects a clear bias in favour of employers\".The UGT also complains that formal talks between unions, government and business were \"unbalanced, restrictive and detrimental to workers\".Montenegro's governing coalition lacks a majority in parliament, and is seeking support for the bill not only from the small, free-market Liberal Initiative (IL) but from hard-right Chega, which since May's general election has been the second-largest party. Its leader, André Ventura, has expressed reservations about the way some measures might affect family life, but looks open to negotiations.Before the election, Montenegro had ruled out deals with Chega, and the unions and the third-biggest party, the Socialists, say the prime minister's mask has slipped.They also warn that politicians on the right want to amend Portugal's 1976 constitution to loosen employment safeguards considered among Europe's strongest.The issue has also become caught up in the campaign for January's presidential election, with several candidates arguing that the labour reform bill flouts Portugal's 1976 constitution.Under Portugal's \"semi-presidential\" system, the head of state can decline to sign bills approved by parliament. Bills can instead be sent to the Constitutional Court for review or the president can exercise a veto that, while it can be overturned by a majority of elected MPs, delays the process, ensuring further discussion.With the government seeking to overhaul so much of the labour code, such scrutiny might stoke voter unease about its radicalism, particularly since the plans were not in the coalition's election manifesto.Unlike many strikes here, Thursday's day of action is not limited to the public sector. At Portugal's largest factory, VW-owned Autoeuropa, south of Lisbon, almost 1,000 employees voted unanimously last week to back it.\"I believe there is no worker in this country unaffected by the negative measures in this reform,\" said UGT secretary-general Mário Mourão, after the Autoeuropa gathering. \"It must be responded to appropriately.\"",

National favourites including pizza are already on Unesco's list of \"intangible cultural heritage\", but now Italian cooking traditions and the way they are practiced and transmitted have been awarded.

The announcement was made during a Unesco assembly meeting in the Indian capital Delhi on Wednesday. The cultural agency described Italian cuisine as a \"means of connecting with family and the community, whether at home, in schools, or through festivals, ceremonies and social gatherings\". Koshary, the spicy dish of lentils, rice, and pasta available at countless Egyptian food stalls, was also added to the list of intangible cultural heritage. Other countries have had their \"practices, skills, traditions and social practices related to foodways\" recognised by Unesco, a spokesperson from the agency told the BBC. Previous examples include \"Washoku, traditional dietary cultures of the Japanese, notably for the celebration of New Year, Breakfast culture in Malaysia: dining experience in a multi-ethnic society, or the Gastronomic meal of the French,\" the spokesperson added. Speaking to La Repubblica, the Rome-based daily newspaper, chef Michelangelo Mammoliti said the news filled him with a great sense of pride both personally as an Italian, as well as professionally as a chef. \"Italy is one of the nations where regional cuisine has a very big impact on culture and traditions,\" said the chef, whose restaurant La Rei Natura in Piedmont is the only new three-star restaurant in the 2026 Michelin Guide. Italy's industry leaders and government ministers will be hoping that the move further boosts tourism to the country, which already welcomes 80 million international visitors annually.Luigi Scordamaglia, CEO of Filiera Italia, which represents all the food and wine companies in the production chain, told Ansa news agency that the move from Unesco marked a success \"for the entire Made in Italy supply chain\". Mr Scordamaglia also spoke about the role of the Mediterranean diet in promoting good health.He added: \"When we talk about the Mediterranean diet, we're talking about our wonderful Italian cuisine, which shares its principles, first and foremost those of balance and variety.\"Swimming pool culture in Iceland; the practice of Cuban Son music and dance; and the art of playing, singing and making the lahuta from Albania also entered Unesco's list of intangible cultural heritage.

    "body": "1 hour agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology Correspondent, San FranciscoShares of cloud computing giant Oracle plunged more than 10% in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the company's revenues fell short of Wall Street expectations.The company reported revenue of $16.06bn (£11.99bn) for the three months that ended in November, compared with the $16.21bn projected by analysts.Revenue growth was up 14%, with a 68% surge in sales at its AI business, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), the company said.OCI services major AI technology developers whose demand for Oracle's AI infrastructure helped the company's shares reach new highs this fall but Wednesday's results failed to quell fears about a potential AI bubble.In September, Oracle agreed a highly sought-after contract with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which agreed to purchase $300bn in computing power from Oracle over five years.Oracle chairman and chief technology officer Larry Ellison briefly became the world's richest man in after the announcement.But the firm's shares have lost 40% of their value since peaking three months ago. Still, they are up by more than a third since the start of the year.In a statement issued on Wednesday, Mr Ellison struck a cautious tone.\"There are going to be a lot of changes in AI technology over the next few years and we must remain agile in response to those changes,\" he wrote.Mr Ellison also appeared to snub Nvidia, the designer of highly-sophisticated AI chips, saying Oracle would buy chips from any maker in order to serve clients.\"We will continue to buy the latest GPUs from Nvidia, but we need to be prepared and able to deploy whatever chips our customers want to buy,\" Mr Ellison declared in a policy he called \"chip neutrality\".Oracle is involved in multiple AI infrastructure arrangements that have raised the prospect that major players in the sector are participating in 'circular financing' deals whereby companies finance purchases of their own products and services.\"Oracle's earnings arrive as investors weigh whether its massive OpenAI partnership might mean overexposure with a customer currently in the spotlight over profitability concerns,\" said Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne following the release of the company's quarterly report.Mr Bourne said Oracle faced mounting scrutiny over the increased debt the company has amassed to fund building data centres.Colleen McHugh, consultant to investment platform Wealthify, said the big questions being asked are whether tech stocks are overvalued and will the AI bubble burst, and given this the share price movement was not surprising.\"It's telling us that many of these tech stocks are priced for absolute perfection, and when there's a revenue miss – which was a small revenue miss to be fair by Oracle yesterday - they do get penalised,\" she told the BBC's Today programme.Others said Wall Street's negative reaction was unfounded.\"This was nothing but a great quarter for Oracle,\" said Cory Johnson, Chief Market Strategist at Epistrophy Capital Research. \"Revenue growth of 14% is accelerating.\"Including the OpenAI deal from September, Mr Johnson noted, Oracle has signed $385bn in contracts over six months, and \"those new clients are the likes of Meta and Nvidia.\"\"But AI sentiment is so bad right now, that's seen as a bad thing for Oracle,\" he added.Oracle raised a record $18bn in a massive bond sale in September, one of the largest debt issuances ever in the tech sector.\"Although Oracle's shares are buoyed by its September surge, this revenue miss will likely exacerbate concerns among already cautious investors about its OpenAI deal and its aggressive AI spending,\" Mr Bourne said.The Ellison family, supporters of US President Donald Trump, also recently purchased Paramount and have spearheaded a bid to take over another major Hollywood studio, Warner Brothers Discovery.",

    "body": "Does Japan's megaquake warning mean the 'big one' is coming?2 days agoShaimaa Khalil,BBC News, TokyoandFlora Drury,BBC News, LondonAFP via Getty ImagesAfter a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck north-eastern Japan on Monday, authorities again warned of the possibility of a future megaquake.It means that thoughts in Japan are turning to the \"big one\" - a once-in-a-century quake.In September, Japan's earthquake investigation panel said there was a 60-90% chance that a megaquake would occur in the Nankai Trough  - an area of seismic activity which stretches along Japan's Pacific coast - within the next 30 years. In April authorities had warned that a megaquake had the potential to trigger a tsunami of more than 20m (66ft) which could hit parts of Tokyo and other prefectures. They predicted that there would be around 300,000 deaths and trillions of dollars in economic damage.So, what is the \"big one\", can it be predicted - and is it likely to strike any time soon?What did the latest warning say?Officials urged residents in seven prefectures from Hokkaido in the north to Chiba in central Japan to stay on high alert for a potential megaquake.This is a vast area with millions of people.A government official said there was a possibility that \"a large-scale earthquake with a magnitude of 8 or higher could occur as a follow-up earthquake\" in the region.Authorities also told people to check evacuation routes, secure furniture, and prepare emergency kits, including food, water and portable toilets.However, an evacuation order was not issued. Japan's director for disaster management said at a news conference that global earthquake data suggests there's a possibility, not a prediction, of a larger tremor to come.Officials said the possibility of a larger quake occurring is about one in 100. What is a megaquake?APThe last megaquake occured along the Nankai Trough almost 80 years agoJapan is a country used to earthquakes. It sits on the Ring of Fire and, as a result, experiences about 1,500 earthquakes a year. The vast majority do little damage, but there are some - like the one which struck in 2011 measuring magnitude 9.0, sending a tsunami into the north-east coast and killing more than 18,000 people.But the one that authorities fear may strike in this more densely populated region to the south could - in the absolute worst-case scenario - be even more deadly.Earthquakes along the Nankai Trough have already been responsible for thousands of deaths. In 1707, a rupture along its entire 600km length caused the second-biggest earthquake ever recorded in Japan and was followed by the eruption of Mount Fuji.The Nankai Trough sits between Suruga Bay, in central Japan, and the Hyuganada Sea in Kyushu to the southThese so-called \"megathrust\" earthquakes tend to strike every hundred years or so, often in pairs: the last ones were in 1944 and 1946.And this long-anticipated event is, according to geologists Kyle Bradley and Judith A Hubbard, \"the original definition of the 'Big One'”.\"The history of great earthquakes at Nankai is convincingly scary\" so as to be concerning, the pair acknowledged in their Earthquake Insights newsletter last year.But can earthquakes actually be predicted?Not according to Robert Geller, professor emeritus of seismology at the University of Tokyo.When authorities issued a megaquake warning last year, after a 7.1 quake struck southern Japan, Prof Geller told the BBC that the warning had \"almost nothing to do with science\".The advisory was \"not a useful piece of information\", he said.This, he argued, is because while earthquakes are known to be a \"clustered phenomenon\", it is \"not possible to tell in advance whether a quake is a foreshock or an aftershock”.Indeed, only about 5% of earthquakes are \"foreshocks\", said Bradley and Hubbard.However, the 2011 earthquake was preceded by a 7.2 magnitude foreshock, they note - one which was largely ignored.The warning system was drawn up after 2011 in an attempt to prevent a disaster of this scale again. August 2024 was the first time the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) used it.Getty ImagesA massive earthquake in 2011 killed more than 18,000 peopleBut, crucially, while it told people to be prepared, it did not tell anyone to evacuate. Indeed, they were keen to play down any massive imminent risk.\"The likelihood of a new major earthquake is higher than normal, but this is not an indication that a major earthquake will definitely occur,\" the JMA said at the time.Additional reporting by Chika Nakayama and Jake Lapham",

    "body": "1 day agoGeeta Pandey,BBC CorrespondentandVishnukant Tiwari,BBC HindiRishabh Rajput and Sonali ChoukseyRishabh Rajput and Sonali Chouksey were married last monthRishabh Rajput and Sonali Chouksey met in college 11 years ago, fell in love and married last month.Photos and videos from their colourful wedding showed the happy couple from the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh performing rituals and posing in their finery.But when they shared their happiest moment on social media, the congratulatory messages came peppered with \"jokes and memes\" with trolls comparing and criticising the couple over the groom's skin colour.In India, where obsession with fair skin colour is well documented and can sometimes even have tragic consequences, the groom faced intense online shaming and was called names for his \"darker skin colour\". The trolls did not spare the bride either, with many suggesting she had married him \"for his money\". \"She must have had some compulsion,\" one wrote. Another suggested she couldn't be happy with a husband like that. Some labelled her a \"gold-digger,\" claiming she married him for wealth or a secure government job with perks. One comment suggested that Mr Rajput's father must be \"a government minister\".The couple, who married on 23 November, have since gone viral because of the trolling - and their response, as they addressed the criticism head-on. They have been sought out by local media and given scores of interviews in the past two weeks.\"People were making jokes and memes and it felt very wrong,\" Mr Rajput told BBC Hindi from his home in Jabalpur.\"It was our moment and we had waited for it so many years. It was supposed to be a happy moment, but when I saw people's reactions, I was really shocked,\" he said.\"In so many years that we have been together, no-one had ever told us that we were a mismatch because I have dark complexion while she is fairer,\" he added.BBC HindiSonali Chouksey and Rishabh Rajput met in college in 2014 and fell in loveThe nasty comments left the couple - who both work in private companies - reeling.Ms Chouksey admitted that such comments \"bothered\" her. \"You think - is this is how people are perceiving us? When they say nasty things about him or call me a gold-digger, it irritates me.\"In a post on Instagram, Mr Rajput addressed the trolls: \"Sorry to disappoint you. I'm not a government employee, but I work hard for my family and want to give them a good, dignified life.\"He added that Sonali fell in love with him when he had nothing. \"From college till today, she has stood with me through every good and bad moment. People's negative opinions mean nothing to me,\" he wrote.Mr Rajput also addressed the issue of colourism in the comments, saying he had faced colour discrimination his whole life.\"I know very well that I have a dark complexion. But in my wife's eyes, I am trying to be the best husband I can be, and that is what matters the most. There is no need to speak wrongly about my family.\"Mr Rajput said he pushed back when the trolls began commenting on one of the photos that also had his mother and his and his wife's sisters.\"I did not like the fact that they targeted my family. I want to tell them, you are a nobody. And you have no right to target - or troll - anyone's family,\" he said.The couple, together since meeting in a 2014 college zoology class, say outsiders shouldn't judge their lives.\"Our relationship began a year later and we knew from then that one day we would be married. Those who are commenting on our relationship by looking at a 30-second video don't know that it captures 11 years of hard work that we have put into it,\" says Mr Rajput.\"Sonali had always manifested that when we get married, our entire village should witness it. But today, it seems like the whole world is watching it,\" he says.That attention, the couple agree, feels good in a way. But the comments, Ms Chouksey adds, are hurting their families. \"For people, it may be just something they watch on social media, but it's our life. And it can destroy someone's family.\"The couple have also addressed colourism in several of their interviews.\"We live in India where people from different regions have different skin colour. And fair skin doesn't necessarily make someone a good person. So, how can we judge someone on the basis of their skin colour?\" asks Ms Chouksey.Mr Rajput says \"about 70-80% people in India have darker skin tones, but the Indian mentality is that fairer is better. It's time to change that notion\".And for those who say the couple are a mismatch, he has a question: \"When you look at us, do we look even remotely unhappy to you? We don't. Because we have what most people don't have. I have her and she has me.\"",

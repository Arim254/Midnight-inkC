    "body": "A grizzly bear is on the loose after attacking a school group in Canada, leaving 11 people injured, two critically.The incident happened on Thursday afternoon on a walking trail in the town of Bella Coola, in the province of British Columbia (BC). Residents have been warned to remain indoors while armed officers try to track down the animal. Four of the injured remain in hospital as of Friday afternoon, BC's Health Services Authority has said.A male teacher \"got the whole brunt of it\" and some children were hit with bear spray as the adults tried to fend off the animal, Veronica Schooner, a parent, told the Canadian Press.Ms Schooner said her 10-year-old son was part of the school group, though he was not attacked. \"He said that bear ran so close to him, but it was going after somebody else,\" she said, adding that \"he even felt its fur\".In a statement to the BBC, British Columbia Emergency Health Services said two people were critically injured, two more were seriously hurt, and seven others were treated at the scene.Patients had to be transported to a nearby airport so they could be airlifted to the closest hospital, officials said. The group were from Acwsalcta School, which is run by the indigenous Nuxalk Nation, in the town located 700km (435 miles) north-west of Vancouver. \"Officers are armed\" the Nation wrote on Facebook. \"Remain indoors and off the highway.\" \"It's hard to know what to say during this very difficult time. We are so grateful for our team and our students.\" The Nation's officials have temporarily shut the school, offering counselling services.",

    "body": "Armed men posing as officials from India's central bank have robbed a vehicle transporting 70m rupees ($800,000; £600,000) in the southern state of Karnataka, police say.A massive operation has been launched to find the men who robbed the van in the heart of Bengaluru city in daylight.The robbery occurred on Wednesday afternoon. Six men in an SUV stopped a cash transport van on a busy road as it was moving money between bank branches, Bengaluru police commissioner Seemant Kumar Singh told the BBC.The van was carrying a driver, a cash custodian and two armed security guards.Mr Singh says the robbers told the people in the van that they were officials from the Reserve Bank of India and needed to verify if they had the correct documents to transport such a huge amount of money. The gang told the cash custodian and guards to leave their weapons in the van and get into the SUV, while the driver was instructed to continue driving with the cash, police said.The SUV followed the cash van for a few kilometres before the gang forced the driver out of the van, made the cash custodian and guards get out of the SUV, transferred the cash at gunpoint, and fled.The area had little CCTV coverage, and police are investigating if the gang used multiple vehicles in the operation.The cash transportation service company has filed a police complaint.The SUV used in the heist had a fake number plate and a sticker that read \"Government of India\", a police official told the BBC on condition of anonymity. The official added that police were also investigating if the company employees had anything to do with the heist.Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah told reporters that police have recovered the SUV used in the heist.But Home Minister G Parameshwara has said that it is not yet clear which vehicle the suspects had used to escape. \"It was verified that they changed vehicles and moved the money,\" he told reporters.He said he was confident police would solve the case soon, as they had with other recent high-profile bank robberies in Karnataka.In May, 59kg of gold worth 532.6m rupees was stolen from a Vijayapura district bank using a duplicate locker key. Police have since recovered 39kg of gold and some cash, and arrested 15 people, including two former employees.",

    "body": "10 hours agoNadine YousifThe State of Missouri's Commission on Retirement, Removal and Discipline of JudgesJudge Thornhill of Missouri was disciplined for referencing Elvis Presley and dressing up as the singer in court. A Missouri court is all shook up following the resignation of a judge who was disciplined for wearing an Elvis Presley wig in court and occasionally playing the singer's songs during proceedings. Matthew EP Thornhill, the longest-serving circuit judge in St Charles County, is a self-described Elvis lover, according to his biography page. But his love for the King of Rock'n'Roll contributed to a disciplinary commission demanding his suspension, citing his frequent \"irrelevant\" Elvis references in court. In a letter explaining his actions, Judge Thornhill said his aim was \"to add levity at times when I thought it would help relax litigants\".\"I now recognize that this could affect the integrity and solemnity of the proceedings,\" Judge Thornhill wrote in a letter dated 12 November to the Missouri Supreme Court. According to a report by Missouri's Commission on Retirement, Removal and Discipline of Judges, which investigates allegations of judicial misconduct, Judge Thornhill \"would routinely wear an Elvis Presley wig on or about October 31\" - or Halloween - in court while conducting court business.The report shows images of the judge sitting on the bench while donning an Elvis wig with his signature black pompadour and sunglasses. It adds that, on occasion, Judge Thornhill would give litigants or witnesses the option of being sworn in while playing Elvis music from his phone. He would also refer to the singer occasionally during court proceedings, including mentioning his date of birth or death and lyrics from his music, according to the inquiry report. St Charles County Circuit CourtJudge Matthew EP Thornhill is a self-described Elvis lover, according to his biography page.Judge Thornhill's burning love for all things Elvis is well-documented. In an interview with a local media outlet last year, he said he had visited Graceland, where the singer lived and is buried, 13 times. He added that Elvis was always on his mind since he was a child.The disciplinary report also cites unrelated conduct, like sharing his political affiliation or preferred candidates in elections from the bench, as well as promoting his own election campaign by asking witnesses, lawyers and litigants if they had seen his \"Thornhill for Judge\" signs around town. The commission found that Judge Thornhill had \"failed to maintain order and decorum in the courtroom\", and recommended he be suspended without pay for six months, then serve for another 18 months before retiring. In the 12 November letter, Judge Thornhill did not dispute any of the allegations, saying they are \"substantially accurate\" and acknowledged he had made a mistake. He agreed to the terms set out by the commission, which allowed him to conclude his service on the bench and retire after 20 years. ",

    "body": "Raccoons may be inching closer to becoming America's next pet.Affectionately referred to as trash pandas, the masked mammals known for rummaging rubbish bins for easy food, are evolving based on their proximity to humans, even starting to look cuter, a new study says. Evaluation of nearly 20,000 photos found \"a clear reduction in snout length\" in urban raccoons compared to their rural cousins - a physical shift consistent with the early stages of domestication seen in cats and dogs.Some that have been adopted as pets have become TikTok celebrities. One particularly bold dumpster-diver even sprinted across the pitch during a Major League Soccer match in Philadelphia last year.The stripe-tailed mammals, also nicknamed \"backyard bandits\", are widespread across the contiguous US. Their ability to thrive in both wild and urban settings has left them occupying an unusual space in American life - beloved pet in some neighbourhoods, persistent pest in others.The proximity to humans could signal that the creatures are growing more comfortable around us, or, scientifically speaking, dampening their innate flight responses, according to the study published in the journal Frontiers in Zoology.The softening of their features could be due to shifts in their fight-or-flight response on the cellular level, it says.This urban domestication starts with trash, the study's co-author, Raffaela Lesch of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, told Scientific American.\"Trash is really the kickstarter,\" she said. \"Wherever humans go, there's trash — and animals love our trash.\"But to take advantage of this endless buffet, wildlife must strike a delicate balance: bold enough to root through bins and navigate human environments, yet not so bold as to pose a threat. \"If you have an animal that lives close to humans, you have to be well-behaved enough,\" Lesch said. \"That selection pressure is quite intense.\"The finding, the authors said, is consistent with the \"domestication syndrome phenotype\". Domestication syndrome - anatomical and morphological changes such as curly tails, floppy ears, depigmentation, smaller brains and reduced facial skeletons - are commonly cited as some of the most salient traits, the study says. Those traits are also seen among more common household pets, such as dogs that evolved from wolves.The study's authors also hypothesised that the domestication process is wrongly believed to be initiated by humans, who have captured or selectively bred animals in the past. The process might actually begin much earlier than previously thought, they said, notably when animals became habituated to human environments.\"Only animals with dampened flight (or fight) responses would succeed best,\" the authors wrote. \"This makes the initial stages of the domestication process a process of pure natural selection.\"",

    "body": "1 day agoVictoria GillScience correspondentgettyThe \"swarm\" of tens of thousands of earthquakes near the Greek island of Santorini earlier this year was triggered by molten rock pumping through an underground channel over three months, scientists have discovered.They used physics and artificial intelligence to work out exactly what caused the more than 25,000 earthquakes, which travelled about 20km (12 miles) horizontally through the Earth's crust. They used each of the tremors as virtual sensors, then used artificial intelligence to analyse patterns associated with them.One of the lead researchers, Dr Stephen Hicks from UCL, said combining physics and machine learning in this way could help forecast volcanic eruptions.What happened in Santorini?The seismic activity started to stir beneath the Greek islands of Santorini, Amorgos, and Anafi in January 2025. The islands experienced tens of thousands of earthquakes - many of which were over magnitude 5.0 and could be felt.Many tourists fled, and locals feared that the nearby underwater volcano, Kolumbo, might be about to erupt -  or that this was a seismic prelude to a larger earthquake, like the devastating, magnitude 7.7 quake that struck the same region in 1956.The scientists, who published their findings in the journal Science, created a 3D map of the Earth around Santorini. They then mapped the evolving patterns of seismic activity of each tremor and the movement and stress in the crust. This resulted in a detailed model of exactly what drove this months-long seismic swarm.The team found that the event was driven by the horizontal movement of magma - from beneath Santorini and the Kolumbo volcano - through a 30km channel that is more than 10km beneath the seafloor.The researchers estimated that the volume of magma that moved through the crust could have filled 200,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. These \"magma intrusions\", as they are known, smashed through layers of rock, triggering thousands of tremors. Lead author on the study, Anthony Lomax, a research geophysicist who develops scientific software to analyse seismic activity, explained: \"The tremors act as if we had instruments deep in the Earth, and they're telling us something.\"[When we analyse] the pattern those earthquakes make in our 3D model of the Earth, it matches very, very well what we expect for magma moving horizontally.\"Does this mean the Santorini unrest is over?For now, the researchers say, it appears to be over.\"The magma remained quite deep - more than 8km depth - in the crust,\" explained Dr Hicks. \"We know that magma can ascend and erupt at the surface in a matter of hours to days, but because the activity has now died down, we can be almost certain that the melt eventually got stuck and cooled down deep in the crust.\"Volcanoes, though, can enter prolonged phases of unrest and unpredictability that can last many years. Recent volcanic activity in south-west Iceland has demonstrated that.And these researchers say using AI, in combination with the fundamental physics of how the Earth's crust moves and responds to stress, could transform the ability to monitor, understand and even forecast volcanic activity. This could help keep people in seismically active parts of the world safe.\"Ultimately, this could be used as a forecasting tool,\" explained Dr Hicks. Whenever we see a cluster of earthquakes, \"that is data that can be used to work out the most likely cause\".",

    "body": "10 hours agoSteve RosenbergRussia editorEPAIt was quite a contrast.On Thursday, a US Pentagon delegation was in Kyiv. They were talking to President Zelensky about a draft plan to end the war in Ukraine.The same day, on Russian state TV, President Putin was in military fatigues. He was talking to his army chiefs about fighting on.\"We have our tasks, our goals,\" the Kremlin leader declared. \"The chief one is the unconditional achievement of the aims of the special military operation.\"The Izvestia newspaper called President Putin's visit to a command post \"a signal to America that he's prepared to negotiate on Ukraine, on Russia's terms\".Which brings us back to the peace plan.On Friday night, President Putin said he had seen the US settlement plan for Ukraine.Addressing a meeting of the Russian security council in Moscow, he described the American proposals as a \"modernised\" version of the plan discussed with Trump at the Alaska summit between the leaders in August.President Putin said he thought the plans could form the basis of final peace settlement.The 28-point proposal, which has been widely leaked and reported on, appeared after a visit to America by President Putin's envoy Kirill Dmitriev. He took part in three days of discussions in Miami with President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff.According to drafts of the peace proposal, Ukraine would cede to Russia parts of the Donbass still under Kyiv's control; the Ukrainian armed forces would be reduced in size and Ukraine would vow not to join Nato.\"The Russian military's effective work should convince Zelensky and his regime that it's better to strike a deal and do it now,\" President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov previously told journalists on a Kremlin conference call.A peace proposal does not automatically mean peace. What if there's no agreement?Pro-Kremlin commentators insist that, deal or no deal, Russia will prevail.\"Everyone thought that the idea of a peace deal had sunk in a swamp,\" wrote Russian news outlet Moskovsky Komsomolets. \"But suddenly, a rocket has shot out of this bog with a new, or rather an 'old new' peace plan, with something of the Alaska summit about it. It shot out like a jack in the box.\"How long and how far will this missile fly? Will it crash, sabotaged by Europe and Kyiv? Even if the launch is a false start, it's unlikely to change the general trend. The balance of power is shifting in Russia's favour.\"But after nearly four years of war Russia is under pressure, too. Since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, not only has Russian's army suffered huge losses on the battlefield, but back home the economy is faltering. Russia's budget deficit is growing, revenues from oil and gas falling.\"Russia's industry is somewhere between stagnation and decline,\" declared the broadsheet Nezavisimaya Gazeta this week.It's unclear, though, whether economic pressures will change President Putin's calculations and convince him that now is the moment to end his so-called special operation: even on terms that many believe benefit Moscow.Many. But not everyone.Some elements of the peace plan haven't gone down well in Russia. Some reports suggest that Ukraine could be offered security guarantees modelled on Nato's Article 5. That might commit Western allies to treat any future Russian attack on Ukraine as an attack on the transatlantic community as a whole and trigger a combined military response.\"This is, in effect, Ukraine in Nato,\" wrote Moskovsky Komsomolets, \"only without the deployment of bases and weapons on its territory.\"The full details of the peace plan have yet to be confirmed. We may be entering another period of intense diplomacy.For now, though, Russia's war on Ukraine continues.",

    "body": "19 hours agoMatt SpiveyGetty ImagesMaría Corina Machado has been in hiding since the start of the yearVenezuela's opposition leader will be considered a \"fugitive\" if she travels to Norway to collect her Nobel Peace Prize, the nation's attorney general has said.Tarik William Saab told news agency AFP that María Corina Machado - who has been living in hiding to avoid arrest - was accused of \"acts of conspiracy, incitement of hatred, and terrorism\".The 58-year-old was named as the prestigious prize's recipient in October, being praised for her efforts towards a \"peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy\".She has long denounced President Nicolás Maduro's government as \"criminal\" and called on Venezuelans to unite to depose it. Many nations view his rule as illegitimate.Machado - who has long been one of the most respected voices in Venezuela's opposition - was barred from running in last year's presidential elections, in which Maduro won a third six-year term in office.The elections were widely dismissed on the international stage as neither free nor fair, and sparked protests across the country.Despite her barring, Machado was able to unite Venezuela's opposition behind her little-known surrogate on the ballot, Edmundo González.The government-controlled National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner - even though tallies from polling stations showed that González had won by a landslide.González later fled to Spain, fearing repression. This was followed by attempts to detain other opposition officials.The Nobel Committee, when announcing the recipient of the prize at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo, hailed Machado as \"one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times\".Nobel chairman Jørgen Watne Frydnes said at the time he hoped Machado would be able to attend an award ceremony in Oslo on 10 December, but acknowledged the serious security situation she faced.Machado expressed shock at winning the prize, saying: \"I am just one person. I certainly do not deserve this.\"She added that it was the \"achievement of a whole society\".Getty ImagesMachado has long been a staunch critic of President Nicolás Maduro (pictured)Among the leaders to congratulate her at the time was US President Donald Trump, who was also up for the award and whom tensions with Maduro's government have become increasingly strained. Attorney General Saab also said Machado was under investigation for her support of the deployment of US military forces in the Caribbean.The Trump administration has launched an operation targeting boats, mostly in the Caribbean, it accuses of transporting drugs from South America to the US. More than 80 people have been killed in the strikes, most of whom were Venezuelan.Trump has accused Maduro of being the leader of a drugs cartel, something the Venezuelan leader has denied.Maduro has, in turn, accused Trump of trying to incite a war to gain control of Venezuela's oil reserves, but recently said he was willing to hold face-to-face talks with representatives of the Trump administration.Meanwhile, Machado has been trying to encourage the Venezuelan military to switch sides and turn on Maduro, outlining her vision for a post-Maduro Venezuela in what she called a \"freedom manifesto\" in a video posted on Tuesday.\"We stand at the edge of a new era - one where our natural rights will prevail,\" she told viewers.",

    "body": "20 hours agoKelly NgWatch: Rescuers wade through deadly floodwaters in VietnamRelentless rains and floods have killed at least 41 people in central Vietnam since the weekend, while a search continues for nine still missing, state media reports.The deluge has submerged more than 52,000 homes and left half a million households and businesses without power, according to reports. Tens of thousands of residents have been evacuated from the flood-affected regions.Rainfall has exceeded 1.5m (5ft) in several areas over the past three days, even rising beyond the 1993 flood peak of 5.2m in some parts.Extreme weather has battered Vietnam in recent months. Two typhoons, Kalmaegi and Bualoi, left a trail of death and destruction within weeks of each other. Getty ImagesThe coastal cities of Hoi An and Nha Trang are among the worst-hitNatural disasters in Vietnam have wreaked damage amounting to $2bn (£1.5bn) between January and October this year, according to government estimates.The areas worst-hit by the latest rainfall include the coastal cities of Hoi An and Nha Trang, as well as a key coffee production belt in the central highlands - where farmers are already reeling from a stalled harvest because of the earlier storms. In the province of Dak Lak, the country's biggest coffee growing region, tens of thousands of homes were submerged, according to state news outlet Tuoi Tre. Vietnam is one of the largest exporters of robusta, the bitter tasting bean used in instant coffee and some espresso blends.Weather conditions in the region are set to last until at least Sunday, according to authorities. Military troops and police officers have been deployed to set up emergency shelters and to relocate people to safety.The province has declared a state of emergency after landslides damaged major roads and highways. Traffic was completely halted after part of the Mimosa Pass, a key entry route into the popular tourist city of Da Lat, collapsed into a ravine, while a bus narrowly avoided falling into the gap, news agency AFP reported.Getty ImagesThe deluge has submerged more than 52,000 homes and left half a million households and businesses without powerPhotographs published by local media show people stranded on roofs as floodwaters fill their homes, while a video circulating online shows a suspension bridge in Lam Dong province getting torn off its anchors. A restaurant owner in Nha Trang told AFP that his shops were submerged by about a metre of water.\"I am worried about our furniture in my restaurants and shops, but of course I cannot do anything now,\" said Bui Quoc Vinh.\"I don't think the water is going to recede soon, as the rain has not stopped.\"Getty ImagesExtreme weather has battered Vietnam in recent monthsEarlier in November, Typhoon Kalmaegi killed at least five people in Vietnam's central coast, uprooting trees, tearing off roofs and smashing windows. Many in Dak Lak province said their homes had collapsed or flooded. The same typhoon had killed 188 people in the Filipino island of Cebu, before making its way to Vietnam. And in September, at least 11 people died after Typhoon Bualoi hit the centre and north of Vietnam. The typhoon had packed winds of 117km/h (73mph) when it made landfall in central Vietnam. Experts say climate change has exacerbated extreme weather, with typhoons becoming stronger and more frequent.",

    "body": "High-profile Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene to quit Congress after Trump feudJust nowKwasi Gyamfi Asiedu,Washington and Anthony Zurcher,North America correspondent, WashingtonKey moments from Trump and Greene's public falloutGeorgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has announced she will resign from office, an unexpected turn for the high-profile Republican days after a public feud with President Donald Trump.Greene, who was one of Trump's Maga superstars in US politics, posted a video statement on social media announcing she would leave Congress on 5 January 2026.The Republican was one of Trump's staunchest defenders in Congress, but her relentless calls for releasing files related to late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein led to a bitter public falling out with the president, who has since labelled her a \"traitor\".\"I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and gets better,\" she said in the video.Trump, who had threatened to support a Republican challenger to unseat Greene, responded to her resignation by calling it \"great news for the country\" in an interview with ABC News.Greene said in the announcement that she did \"not want my sweet district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the president we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms.\" She had been one of the loudest demanding the release of documents related to Epstein, an issue that once united Trump and his base but has become divisive.Trump had spent months arguing that the issue was a distraction concocted by his political detractors to divert attention from his administration's achievements.\"Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,\" Greene said in her resignation letter. Watch: Marjorie Taylor Greene announces resignation in video messageOver the last few months, she has gone on a number of high-profile news shows and was critical of Trump and fellow Republicans. She took issue with the president not doing enough to bring down costs for voters and criticised his tariff policies. But above all, she criticised his administration for not releasing documents related to Epstein.Trump responded last week in a series of social media posts, calling Greene a \"traitor\" and \"wacky\". He said she should be unseated and vowed to back a challenger for her place in Congress.Days after their feud boiled over, Trump reversed course and said he would support the release of files related to Epstein. He signed off on a bill this week that forces the US Justice Department to release the documents within 30 days. Greene was elected to Congress in 2020 amid a backdrop of headlines over her support and promotion of QAnon conspiracies, including claiming school shootings and the 9/11 terror attacks were staged. She has since apologised and sought to distance herself from those comments.In the video announcing her resignation, Greene ticked off a list of political achievements. She noted in her resignation letter that the comments from Trump were \"hurtful\". AFP via Getty ImagesGreene and Trump on the campaign trail in 2024While she announced her departure from the House of Representatives, reports in US media have indicated Greene has shown an interest in running for state office - either as Georgia governor or for a Senate seat. The president has commented publicly about those ambitions, writing on Truth Social during their public feud that he had previously told her that she shouldn't run for either of those offices due to poor public polling. Greene has since said she did not plan to run for either of those offices. Before their public falling out, Trump and Greene had been close allies in championing the \"America First\" agenda. She joined him on the campaign trail and was one of the Republicans most vocal about Trump's false claims that he'd won the 2020 presidential election against Joe Biden. Her departure will further close the gap in the Republican-led House of Representatives, who only hold a handful of seats more than Democrats. Control of the chamber will be up for grabs in the 2026 midterm elections next November. ",

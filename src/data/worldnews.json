    "body": "4 hours agoLaura Gozzi and Paul KirbyReutersThe suspect was detained by police after he set fire to his carA driver has rammed his car into pedestrians and cyclists on the holiday island of Oléron, off the west coast of France, injuring five people - including two who are in a critical condition.A local man, 35, deliberately drove into people and then set fire to the vehicle, authorities said. He was immobilised with a stun gun after resisting arrest.The man drove some distance between two villages on the island, mowing down several people, the mayor of Dolus d'Oléron, Thibault Brechkoff, said.He is now being held by police in Saint-Pierre-d'Oléron on suspicion of attempted murder.The incident took place around 08:45 (07:45 GMT) and lasted 35 minutes. Witnesses described seeing a series of incidents in several places on the island, including the villages of Dolus d'Oléron and Saint-Pierre-d'Oléron, which came to an end outside a bakery.Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez, who travelled to the scene, said an inquiry had been opened, which would determine facts including whether there were \"one or more\" gas cylinders in the suspect's vehicle. \"This individual is known to police for petty crimes. He is not known to intelligence services for radicalisation of any kind,\" Nuñez added. The public prosecutor for La Rochelle, Arnaud Laraize, earlier said the man had shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" (\"God is greatest\") at the moment of his arrest. Nuñez said that a representative from the National Anti-Terrorist Prosecutor's Office was at the scene as an \"observer\" only. One of the badly injured victims is a 22-year-old woman who suffered multiple traumas. The other person to be seriously hurt is reported to be a 69-year-old cyclist. \"There will likely be several other people involved; that is, even if they weren't physically harmed, they witnessed the scene and are obviously very psychologically disturbed by these events,\" Nuñez said. Oléron, a popular holiday destination, is metropolitan France's second largest island after Corsica and connected to the mainland by a road bridge.",

    "body": "Hamas has handed over to the Red Cross a coffin containing what it says is the body of another deceased hostage, the Israeli military has said.The remains will be transferred to Israeli forces, who will take them to the National Centre of Foreign Medicine in Tel Aviv for identification.Under the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal with Israel, which started nearly a month ago, Hamas agreed to return all 20 living and 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages it was holding within 72 hours.Israel has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the dead hostages' bodies, while Hamas has insisted it is struggling to find them under rubble.If the latest remains are confirmed as those of a dead hostage, it will mean six others are still in Gaza – including Israelis and foreign nationals.All the remaining living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has also handed over the bodies of 300 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the Israeli hostages and those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.On Tuesday, the remains of Israeli-American soldier Itay Chen, 19, were returned.Staff Sgt Chen was serving as a soldier in the IDF's 7th Brigade when Hamas-led gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023.The IDF said he was killed inside a tank during a battle in Kibbutz Nir Oz and that his body was taken to Gaza as a hostage by Hamas.The slow progress over the return of the hostages has meant there has been no advance on the second phase of President Trump's Gaza peace plan. This includes plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas, and reconstruction.Israel has allowed members of the Palestinian armed group and Red Cross staff to search for remains in areas still controlled by Israeli forces.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "45 minutes agoAndrew HardingParis correspondentReutersFrench police have launched an investigation into sex-trafficking linked to the disgraced businessman Mohamed Al Fayed, who died two years ago.The police investigation, ordered by the Paris prosecutor's office, will focus on \"potential acts of aggravated human trafficking… with multiple victims,\" according to correspondence seen by the BBC. Prostitution and one case of rape are also being investigated.Al Fayed's Ritz Hotel in Paris will likely be a target of the investigation, amid claims from victims that staff knew about or facilitated the abuse of women.In a statement, the Ritz said it was \"deeply alarmed\" by the allegations of abuse and it would cooperate \"fully\" with authorities.The trafficking investigation marks a new twist in a series of legal battles linked to Al Fayed's violent crimes and to the search – both before and since his death – for some sort of justice for his many victims.An American woman, Pelham Spong, 40, played a key role in triggering this investigation in France, where it is alleged that Al Fayed moved young female staff from the Ritz to his private house in Paris and to various yachts and family homes on the Mediterranean coast.Ms Spong was living in Paris in 2008 when she applied for a job working as a personal assistant for the Al Fayed family in Monaco. She was brought to London several times, subjected to an intrusive gynaecological examination, and then – she alleges - sexually assaulted by Al Fayed in his office on Park Lane.\"He told me the job entailed sleeping with him,\" Ms Spong said, adding that she declined the offer on the spot.\"I didn't realise I was a victim of sex trafficking until this past year when I… saw the scale and scope of the abuse and realised that it was a pattern and a system and a machine,\" she told the BBC in an interview in Paris.Pelham Spong was 23 years old when she first applied to work for Al Fayed's familyA few months ago, Ms Spong, now living back in the USA, came to Paris to report her experiences to the French police, hoping that it might persuade other women to come forward with evidence of their own abuse.\"It's a big step that the prosecutors decided to open an investigation. [Ms Spong] has a really good case because she kept a lot of materials. It will be very strong,\" her lawyer, Anne-Claire Le Jeune told the BBC.Ms Spong said it is \"so much easier to dismiss the actions of an evil man that's dead\". \"And you can't learn anything from that as a society. So how do you prevent this happening again? \"Well, first, you have to name what it... It's critical to call it what it is, trafficking, so that we can prevent it,\" she said.Ms Spong's lawyer, Anne-Claire Le Jeune, says her client has a \"very strong\" caseAl Fayed is also being investigated in the UK, where more than 140 people have reported him to the Met Police.The extent of Al Fayed's predatory behaviour was first brought to light by a BBC documentary and podcast, broadcast in September 2024.Al Fayed: Predator at Harrods heard testimony from more than 20 female ex-Harrods employees who said Al Fayed sexually assaulted or raped them. Since then, dozens more women have come forward with similar experiences.After the broadcast, the Met revealed it had been approached by 21 women before Al Fayed's death, who accused him of sexual offences including rape, sexual assault and trafficking. Despite this, he was never charged with any offences.Ms Spong herself says she spoke to British police about Al Fayed in 2017 but was told he was too ill to be questioned.Earlier this year, the Met wrote to alleged victims apologising, saying it was \"truly sorry\" for the distress they have suffered because Al Fayed will never face justice. The force is currently investigating its handling of historical allegations against Al Fayed and looking into whether others could face charges for enabling his behaviour.Harrods has set aside more than £60m in its plan to compensate alleged victims of Al Fayed's abuse. In a statement announcing the scheme, Harrods said: \"While we cannot undo the past, we have been determined to do the right thing as an organisation, driven by the values we hold today, while ensuring that such behaviour can never be repeated in the future.\"",

    "body": "20 hours agoLana LamSydneyGetty ImagesReddit is one of the latest platforms to be added to Australia's social media banPopular forum site Reddit has been added to Australia's world-first social media ban for children under 16 that starts next month.Live-streaming platform Kick will also be included, bringing the number of sites targeted in the ban to nine. They include Facebook, X, Snapchat, TikTok, YouTube, Instagram and Threads.From 10 December, tech companies can be fined up to A$50m ($32.5m; £25.7m) if they do not take \"reasonable steps\" to deactivate existing accounts for under-16s and prohibit new ones.Each banned platform was chosen as their \"sole or a significant purpose is to enable online social interaction,\" the government said, and more sites may be added given the \"fast-changing\" nature of technology.\"Delaying children's access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,\" said Australia's eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant.Messaging services Discord and WhatsApp and gaming platforms Lego Play and Roblox will not be included, nor will Google Classroom and YouTube Kids.Federal Communications Minister Anika Wells said the online platforms can target children with \"chilling control\" and the ban was about protecting children.\"We aren't chasing perfection, we are chasing a meaningful difference,\" she said.It is unclear how companies will implement the ban - which is being closely watched by global leaders - but some of the potential methods include using official ID documents, parental approval and facial recognition technology. Critics have raised concerns over data privacy and the accuracy of age verification software, with a recent report showing the proposed methods all have risks or shortcomings. Most Australian adults support the ban, according to polls, but some mental health advocates say it may cut kids off from connection, and others say it could push youngsters to even-less-regulated corners of the internet.Instead, they say, the government should focus on better policing of harmful content on social media platforms and prepare children for the reality of life on the web.An Australian influencer family who have millions of YouTube follower recently announced their decision to move to the UK to avoid the upcoming ban, namely so their 14-year-old daughter can continue to create online content.YouTube was initially exempt from the ban but in July, the government reversed its decision, saying the video sharing site was \"the most frequently cited platform\" where children aged 10 to 15 years saw \"harmful content\".Teens under 16 will still be able to view YouTube videos but will not be permitted to have an account, which is required for uploading content or interacting on the platform.",

    "body": "Trump U-turns to renominate billionaire for Nasa chief5 hours agoTiffany WertheimerReutersJared Isaacman is reportedly friends with Elon Musk and has spent millions of dollars on SpaceX missionsDonald Trump has renominated billionaire investor Jared Isaacman to run Nasa, five months after withdrawing his first nomination.The 42-year-old entrepreneur, who has ties to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, had looked set to lead the space agency when Trump abruptly pulled his nomination in late May, following what the president said was a \"thorough review of prior associations.\"While the White House did not specify what those associations were, it was during Trump's high-profile feud with Musk.Isaacman, who is worth an estimated $1.9bn (£1.46bn), is an amateur jet pilot and also became the first non-professional astronaut to walk in space last year, on a mission with SpaceX that he bankrolled.Why Trump has suddenly changed his mind is unclear, and the president made no mention of the past when he wrote on his Truth Social platform that he was \"pleased to nominate\" Isaacman for the role.\"Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era,\" the president wrote.The Nasa administrator role will be Isaacman's first job in politics, representing a departure from the last two men appointed to the job.It requires confirmation by the Senate, where the Republican Party holds a 53-47 majority. Even though the US government has been shut down since early October, the Senate is still able to confirm presidential nominees.Thanking the president, Isaacman wrote on X that \"it will be an honor\" to serve in the role.\"The support from the space-loving community has been overwhelming,\" he wrote in a long post, that also acknowledged Nasa scientists and innovators. \"I am not sure how I earned the trust of so many, but I will do everything I can to live up to those expectations.\"Sean Duffy, the head of the transport department, has been interim Nasa chief since July.Isaacman's initial nomination withdrawal came just days after Elon Musk left the Trump administration, following a tumultuous drive to shrink the size of government departments with his Doge initiative, leading to thousands of job cuts.Concerns were voiced over Isaacman's ties to Musk and his SpaceX company, where Isaacman has reportedly spent hundreds of millions of dollars. He has also made donations to the Democrats in past elections.His nomination has encountered scepticism, and at his initial confirmation hearing in April, members of both parties questioned Isaacman about possible conflicts of interest, budget cuts and his desire to send astronauts to Mars.They expressed fears he would sacrifice the long-planned Moon mission to focus on Mars, but Isaacman said both can be possible.\"We don't have to make a binary decision of Moon versus Mars, or Moon has to come first versus Mars,\" he later added.The billionaire - who was a high-school dropout - made his fortune from payment processing company Shift4 Payments, which he founded in 1999 in his parents' basement when he was 16.Isaacman has a longstanding interest in flying - having first taken pilot lessons in 2004 and later setting a world record for the fastest circumnavigation of the world in a light jet.More on this story",

    "body": "20 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporter, OttawaCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney has put forward his first federal budget, which lays out an ambitious plan to transform Canada's economy and deal with the challenge of US tariffs.Billed an \"investment budget\" by the government, the fiscal plan increases Canada's deficit to C$78bn ($55.3bn; £42.47bn), the second largest in history. The spending is offset by plans to attract C$1tn of investment into Canada over the next five years, with the federal government arguing more restrained spending would eliminate \"vital social programmes\" and funding for Canada's future. The budget does outline cuts, however, including slashing the size of the federal workforce by some 10% in the coming years. The budget was presented by Canada's finance minister, François-Philippe Champagne, in the House of Commons late on Tuesday afternoon. In his budget speech, Champagne warned that Canada is facing \"a time of profound change\" and that \"bold and swift action is needed\" to ensure the country prospers.Peppered throughout the budget are references to uncertainty and the need for protectionist measures as a result of US tariffs on Canada. President Donald Trump has placed a broad 35% levy on Canadian goods not covered by an existing free trade agreement, and has tariffed specific sectors like steel, aluminium and automobiles. These levies, enacted earlier this year, have already led to Canadian job losses in those sectors, and business leaders have warned of a chill on investment in Canada due to trade uncertainty. To counter this, the budget proposes spending of C$280bn over the next five years \"to strengthen Canada's productivity, competitiveness, and resilience\". These include updating ports and other trade infrastructure with the goal of doubling Canadian exports to non-US markets over the next decade, as well as direct financing to support firms impacted by tariffs.The fiscal update also outlines a plan to boost Canada's competitiveness, with the goal of making Canada a more attractive place to do business than the US.Rebekah Young, the head of inclusion and resilience economics at Scotiabank, said the budget lays out a plan to reduce timelines and smooth regulatory hurdles with the hopes that it will boost private investment in Canada over the years.But she cautioned that parts of the budget might be a hard sell for Canadians struggling immediately with the cost of living.\"They're going to open this budget and not see any new (supports),\" she said. And while the budget delivers on its promise of generational spending, Ms Young said it remains to be seen if it will be as \"transformational\" as Carney hopes.\"We want to unlock a trillion dollars based on this investment here. A lot has to happen to get to that trillion,\" she said. On defence, the budget pledges nearly C$82bn over five years—the largest funding in decades—putting Canada in line with its Nato commitment to spend 2% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on its military by this year.The Carney government is also betting big on AI, proposing nearly C$1bn to boost integration and use of the rapidly growing technology, including in government operations.Carney warned Canadians ahead of the budget of \"sacrifices\". Among them is a reduction of the size of the federal government that would result in 40,000 job losses by 2029. International aid is also slated to be cut to pre-pandemic levels. Immigration targets have been lowered slightly over the next three years to \"stabilise\" new admissions to the country, including a significant cut to student visas.The budget will need to be passed by Canada's parliament before it's implemented. Carney's Liberal government is just shy of a majority, meaning it will need the support of other parties to enact its fiscal plan. Failure to pass the budget could risk a federal election. One Conservative MP, Chris d'Entremont, said in a statement released by the Liberals on Tuesday night that he had resigned from the Conservative caucus and will be crossing the floor to Carney’s party.In the statement, the MP said that the  budget “hits the priorities I have heard most in my riding“.​​This narrows Carney's razor-thin minority at a critical time.Meanwhile, Conservative opposition MPs have criticised the budget for increasing Canada's deficit while doing little to address affordability for Canadians. Yves-Francois Blanchet, the leader of the separatist Bloc Québécois party, said his caucus does not see how they could support the budget. Members of the left-leaning New Democratic Party said they will take the time to study it, but have criticised planned public sector cuts. With the projected larger deficit, Carney's fiscal plan maintains that Canada's still has the lowest deficit-to-GDP ratio in the G7, behind only Japan.",

The ship left without her, only returning several hours later when the crew realised Ms Rees was missing.Officials from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) boarded the vessel on Wednesday morning local time.Amsa, which is probing the incident alongside Queensland Police and the state coroner, told the BBC it could not comment on the investigation.The 60-day cruise around Australia, which had cost guests tens of thousands of dollars, was cancelled due to Ms Rees' death as well as mechanical issues.The Coral Adventurer had been expected to dock at Cairns – where its operator Coral Expeditions is based.But a lack of available berths meant it instead dropped anchor a few kilometres north early on Tuesday evening, off the coast of Yorkey's Knob, where it remained on Wednesday morning.The BBC understands only a skeleton crew were on board.Ship tracking data showed one of the vessel's smaller boats, known as a tender, moving between the ship and the shore on Tuesday night.All passengers disembarked at Horn Island in the far north of Queensland over the weekend and were transferred to the mainland on a charter plane.The Coral Adventurer caters for up to 120 guests with 46 crew, according to the company's website. It was purpose-built to access remote areas of Australia's coast.Tracking data shows the vessel initially left Cairns at around 07:30 local time on 24 October - after a delay of around a week because of mechanical issues.The next day it reached Lizard Island - also known as Jiigurru or Dyiigurra - in the northern area of the Great Barrier Reef for the first stop on the journey.Passengers aboard were transported by tenders to the secluded island – home to a luxury resort and a research station - for a day trip with the option of hiking or snorkelling.Suzanne Rees' daughter, Katherine Rees, said last week that her family was \"shocked and saddened that the Coral Adventurer left Lizard Island after an organised excursion without my mum\".She described her mother, who was from Sydney,  as an \"active 80-year-old\" who was a member of a bushwalking group.\"From the little we have been told, it seems that there was a failure of care and common sense.\"Ms Rees added that she hoped the coroner's inquiry would be able to pinpoint what \"the company should have done that might have saved mum's life\".\"We understand from the police that it was a very hot day, and mum fell ill on the hill climb,\" she said.\"She was asked to head down, unescorted. Then the ship left, apparently without doing a passenger count.\"At some stage in that sequence, or shortly after, mum died, alone.\"A search and rescue effort late on Saturday 25 October – the day she went missing – did not find any sign of Ms Rees. Her body was discovered the following day.Last week Mark Fifield, the chief executive of the cruise operator Coral Expeditions, confirmed the firm was \"working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation\".Mr Fifield said that the company was \"deeply sorry that this has occurred\" and had offered its full support to the Rees family.",

    "body": "14 hours agoEmma SaundersCulture reporterA collection of diaries has won the prestigious Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction for the first time.How to End a Story: Collected Diaries by Helen Garner charts the Australian writer's life from the early stages of her career in bohemian Melbourne, to raising her daughter in the 1970s, and her experience of a disintegrating marriage in the 1990s.Garner's previous work includes 2014's The House of Grief, which told the story of Robert Farquharson on trial for the murder of his three sons.Famous fans include fellow writer David Nicholls, and singer Dua Lipa, who said: \"Helen Garner's work is a thrilling discovery. She's one of the most fascinating writers I have come across.\"Chair of judges, Robbie Millen, said How to End a Story was the judges' unanimous winner, praising it as \"a remarkable, addictive book\".\"Garner takes the diary form, mixing the intimate, the intellectual, and the everyday, to new heights,\" he continued. \"She is a brilliant observer and listener - every page has a surprising, sharp or amusing thought. Her collected diaries will surely be mentioned alongside The Diary of Virginia Woolf.\" In her review, the Observer's Rachel Cooke also referenced the revered Modernist author, describing Garner's collection as \"the greatest, richest journals by a writer since Virginia Woolf's\".This marks the first major UK-based prize win for the Australian, who has been belatedly receiving attention in the UK following the British publication of three of her books for the first time last year.The Baillie Gifford Prize rewards the best of non-fiction and is open to authors of any nationality. As the winner, Garner will receive £50,000, with the other shortlisted authors each receiving £5,000, bringing the total prize value to £75,000.The selection was made from over 350 books published between 1 November 2024 and 31 October 2025.The others who made the shortlist were:The Revolutionists: The Story of the Extremists Who Hijacked the 1970s by Jason Burke, about a group of extremists including Carlos the Jackal and the Baader-Meinhof Gang.The Boundless Deep: Young Tennyson, Science and the Crisis of Belief by Richard Holmes, a biography about the young Alfred Lord TennysonCaptives and Companions: A History of Slavery and the Slave Trade in the Islamic World by Justin Marozzi, it covers slavery in the Islamic world from the 7th Century to the present dayLone Wolf: Walking the Faultlines of Europe by Adam Weymouth, this book follows a young wolf's 1000-mile trek across the European AlpsElectric Spark by Frances Wilson, a biography of novelist Muriel Spark",

    "body": "6 hours agoMadeline HalpertNew York CityWatch: Joy precedes scrutiny, reports Nada Tawfik from inside Mamdani's victory partyZohran Mamdani, 34, has won New York City's race for mayor in a contest that rallied young voters and sparked debate about the future direction of the US Democratic Party.Ugandan-born Mamdani, a Democrat, beat former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, to become the youngest person in over a century to lead the largest city in the US.\"My friends, we have toppled a political dynasty,\" the self-described democratic socialist told the crowd during a victory speech.Democrats also won governor races in Virginia and New Jersey, while in California voters backed a proposition to redraw the congressional electoral map ahead of next year's midterm elections. Mamdani made affordability the central message of his campaign, pledging to expand social programmes paid for by new taxes on high earners and corporations.In New York, he was a relatively unknown member of the state assembly until his campaign gained online momentum a few months ago, propelling him to victory in the Democratic primary contest over the summer.Mamdani has become the first South Asian and Muslim to lead the city. In his victory speech, he spoke of a \"new age\".\"For as long as we can remember, the working people of New York have been told by the wealthy and the well-connected that power does not belong in their hands,\" Mamdani said. \"The future is in our hands,\" he said, pledging to create a government that works \"for everyone\".Mamdani's campaign has drawn significant national attention, including from US President Donald Trump, who in the days before the vote threatened to withhold federal funds from New York if Mamdani won. The president calls Mamdani a communist - a label that Mamdani rejects.In overnight projections from BBC news partner CBS, Mamdani had secured 50.3% of the vote, compared with Cuomo's 41.6%. Republican Curtis Sliwa had just over 7%. Shortly after the winner was projected, Sliwa conceded.\"We have a mayor-elect,\" Sliwa told a group of supporters. \"Obviously I wish him good luck, because if he does well, we do well.\"Cuomo also conceded, congratulating Mamdani despite a chorus of boos from his supporters. But Cuomo highlighted that almost half of New Yorkers who voted had not picked Mamdani, and said his opponent had made \"promises that cannot be met\".There are questions over how Mamdani will pay for his ambitious social agenda and critics have questioned how a politician with no executive experience will handle a hostile Trump administration.On Tuesday night, Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson criticised the \"consequences\" of New York City's choice on social media platform X. \"Zohran Mamdani's election cements the Democrat Party's transformation to a radical, big-government socialist party,\" he wrote.The president also posted on social media, blaming the shutdown, and his not appearing on the ballot, for Republican losses Tuesday night. Wins for other Jay Jones and other DemocratsCentrist Democrats clinched victories in elections for governor on Tuesday night, with Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill winning races to run the states of Virginia and New Jersey respectively.The races were being viewed as an indication of how Americans were feeling about the national government's policies, although the latter state is reliably blue.In another closely watched contest in Virginia, Democratic candidate Jay Jones won the race for state attorney general, defeating incumbent Republican candidate Jason Miyares. That was despite a scandal over his historical text messages that wished violence against a political rival, for which Jones apologised.Voters in California also approved a measure to redraw political lines to favour Democrats, in response to similar efforts by conservative-led states in a nationwide battle for control of the US House of Representatives.The redistricting measure, called Prop 50, was aimed at reconfiguring the state's voting districts to give Democrats better chances at taking five seats in the US House of Representatives from Republicans during next year's midterm elections.Whether the measure will tip the balance of power in Washington remains unclear.Questions for national Democratic PartyMamdani's win in New York presents a dilemma for the Democratic establishment, which has been reluctant to endorse him. Mamdani was nonetheless favoured to win his race, having led his rivals in the polls by double digits for weeks leading up to election day. A relatively unknown figure just months ago, few could have predicted his journey from hip-hop artist and housing counsellor to the frontrunner candidate to lead a city with a $116bn (£88bn) budget and global scrutiny.The former New York assemblyman centred his campaign on cost-of-living issues in one of the country's most expensive cities, campaigning on issues like universal child care, and free and faster buses. His candidacy drew criticism from business leaders and centrist Democrats, some of whom did not endorse him, including fellow New Yorker and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Republicans have seized on Mamdani's popularity to paint the future of the Democratic Party as more and more left-leaning - a point that Trump has made during his threats to withhold federal funding to the New York City.",

    "body": "11 hours agoSoutik BiswasIndia correspondent\"A moment comes but rarely in history when we step out from the old to the new,\" Zohran Mamdani told a jubilant crowd in New York on Wednesday - quoting India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru's midnight speech of 1947, when the country  awoke to freedom.\"When an age ends and the soul of a nation finds utterance. Tonight we step out from the old to the new,\" Mamdani continued.As Mamdani wrapped up his victory speech, the title track from the 2004 Bollywood hit Dhoom rang out across the hall - followed by Jay-Z and Alicia Keys' Empire State of Mind, now pulsing with new meaning as New York's first Indian-origin mayor made history. Months earlier, Mamdani had turned Bollywood into campaign language, a nod to his  South Asian roots - his mother is filmmaker Mira Nair, and his father, Mahmood Mamdani, a Ugandan-born scholar of Indian descent. On Instagram, he's recorded several messages in Hindi, often relying on playful imagery and dialogues from popular Bollywood films.Invoking India's first prime minister on Wednesday was a final flourish.Seventy-seven years ago, Nehru, in a sweltering Constituent Assembly hall in Delhi, had prefaced the lines borrowed by Mamdani with one of the most stirring openings in history: \"Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially.\"\"At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom.\"It was just before midnight on 15 August 1947, and India was about to become independent after nearly two centuries of British rule. The words carried both elation and gravity - a promise of responsibility and of a nation finding its voice.Many believe Mamdani's nod to Nehru's speech held out the promise that something new, untested, and potentially transformative had begun in New York.Decades earlier, in another moment of awakening, Nehru had been evoking something far larger - a nation's rebirth.Freedom, Nehru continued, as not an end but a beginning - \"not one of ease or resting but of incessant striving\". The service of India, he insisted, meant serving \"the millions who suffer\" and ending \"poverty and ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity\". He pledged that India's work would not be over \"so long as there are tears and suffering\", and urged unity over \"petty and destructive criticism\" to build \"the noble mansion of free India where all her children may dwell.\"The roughly 1,600-word speech by India's first prime minister has gone down as one of the most famous speeches in history. The New York Times said Nehru had \"electrified his countrymen with a speech of soaring eloquence\". Historian Ramachandra Guha called it a speech \"rich in emotion and rhetoric\". Srinath Raghavan, a historian, told an interviewer that the \"speech still resonates in India because it genuinely captured the moment in the way great speeches can\".There were three main speakers that night: Chaudhry Khaliquz-zaman spoke for India's Muslims, Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, a philosopher, for his eloquence and vision, and Nehru - the star of the evening.The set-up of Nehru's speech was electric. Time magazine reported that Indian leaders had gathered in the Constituent Assembly Hall an hour before midnight. The chamber was \"ablaze with the colours of India's new tricolour flag - orange, white and green\". Nehru made what the magazine called an \"inspired speech\".What followed was pure theatre of history. \"And as the twelfth chime of midnight died out, a conch shell, traditional herald of the dawn, sounded raucously through the chamber. Members of the Constituent Assembly rose. Together they pledged themselves at this solemn moment . . . to the service of India and her people.\"Outside, Indians were rejoicing. In his book India After Gandhi, Guha quotes an American journalist reporting: \"Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs were happily celebrating together... It was Times Square on New Year's Eve. More than anyone else, the crowd wanted Nehru.\"But beneath the euphoria, chaos and violence were already stirring. Across the subcontinent, religious riots broke out. Two days later, the borders were drawn - triggering one of history's largest and bloodiest migrations, as up to 15 million people moved and about a million died.Amid the upheaval, Nehru's words stood out - a reminder of India's unfulfilled promise, and of a leader whose command of language many believe matched the enormity of the moment.By then, Nehru had gained a reputation as a formidable orator, delivering extempore speeches that ranged effortlessly across politics, science, art, and ethics. As Australian diplomat Walter Crocker observed, the breadth and spontaneity of his addresses were \"without parallel\". As he concluded his most famous speech in August 1947, Nehru said: \"We have hard work ahead. There is no resting for any one of us till we redeem our pledge in full, till we make all the people of India what destiny intended them to be.\"Seven decades later, in New York, Mamdani has his own, rather different work cut out for him.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJames ChaterThe cargo plane crashed while taking off from an airport in Louisville, KentuckyAt least nine people were killed when a UPS cargo plane crashed while taking off from an airport in Louisville, Kentucky on Tuesday evening, the state's governor said.Earlier, Andy Beshear said the plane's three crew members were likely among the dead after the freight plane exploded as it departed Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport at around 17:15 local time (22:15 GMT).At least 11 other people were injured when the plane crashed, sending thick plumes of black smoke into the sky.Officials warned that survivors suffered \"very significant\" injuries in the incident and that they were still searching for other victims. Beshear declared a state of emergency on Wednesday to help \"move resources more quickly through emergency management and the Kentucky National Guard\".Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said that the airport has since reopened its runway so that flights can resume. At least 16 different families have reported loved ones unaccounted for, according to Beshear. Two workers at the auto business that was struck were still unaccounted for as of Tuesday evening, and it is not known how many customers were on the premises when the crash happened. In a statement, UPS said three crew members were on board, adding \"we have not confirmed any injuries/casualties\".Local officials said on Wednesday that they were unsure how many victims they were searching for, and that the fire destroyed the plane, creating a large debris zone that would make it challenging to find people. A preliminary investigation is under way but officials have said it is too early to say what caused the crash. Kentucky Representative Morgan McGarvey said 28 people from the National Transportation Safety Board were on the ground and would \"analyse absolutely every bit of what happened\". Officials did note, though, that the massive blaze was due to the amount of fuel onboard the aircraft, which was beginning a journey of around 4,300 miles (6,920km) to Hawaii.It was carrying 38,000 gallons (144,000 litres) of fuel when it crashed.This made it look like it was \"raining oil\" in Louisville when the crash occurred, McGarvey said. It has not been confirmed what cargo was on board, though officials have said the plane was not carrying anything that would create a heightened risk of contamination.The explosion engulfed at least two nearby businesses, including a petroleum recycling company. A shelter-in-place order was initially issued for within five miles of the airport due to concerns of further explosions and air pollution, but was later reduced to just one mile.All departing flights for Tuesday evening were cancelled, the airport said in a statement on X.Louisville Fire Department Chief Brian O'Neal said the amount of fuel spilled at the crash site made it a \"very dangerous situation\".The shelter-in-place order was reduced to a one-mile radius as crews worked to contain the blaze on Tuesday night.Watch: Aerial view of Louisville airport as firefighters tackle blazeAt a press conference, Beshear warned people not to go to the crash site.\"Anyone who has seen the images and the video knows how violent this crash is,\" he said.\"There are still dangerous things that are flammable, that are potentially explosive.\"Louisville Metro Police Dept Chief Paul Humphrey said that the crash site will be \"an ongoing active scene for the next several days\".He added: \"We don't know how long it's going to take to render that scene safe for the investigation to take place.\"Getty ImagesA McDonnell Douglas MD-11 cargo jet at the UPS Worldport facility in Louisville, Kentucky, in 2022 (file photo)The model of aircraft involved was a MD-11F triple-engine plane, which first entered service 34 years ago with Thai Airways as a passenger jet, but was transferred to UPS in 2006.The aircraft was originally manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, which merged with Boeing in 1997.In 2023, FedEx and UPS both announced plans to begin retiring their fleets of MD-11s over the next decade as part of plans to modernise their fleets.In a statement, Boeing said it is \"ready to support our customer\" and that \"our concern is for the safety and well-being of all those affected.\"It added that it will offer technical assistance to the NTSB. ReutersThick plumes of smoke billowed into the sky from the crash siteLouisville is home to UPS Worldport, a global hub for the delivery firm's air cargo operations and its largest package handling facility in the world.In a statement, UPS said it was \"terribly saddened\" by the incident and would be halting package sorting operations at Worldport on Tuesday night.It added: \"UPS is committed to the safety of our employees, and customers and the communities we serve. This is particularly true in Louisville, home to our airline and thousands of UPSers.\"If you are in the US and have been affected by this story you can get in touch here",

    "body": "8 hours agoGeorge Wright,in London, Virma Rivera,in Manila and Koh Ewe,in SingaporeWatch: Filipino families assess damage after Typhoon KalmaegiAt least 85 people have been killed while hundreds of thousands fled their homes as one of strongest typhoons this year ripped through the central Philippines, authorities say.Typhoon Kalmaegi has flooded entire towns on the most populated central island of Cebu, where at least 49 of the fatalities were located. There are 75 others missing and 17 injured, officials said on Wednesday.Videos show people sheltering on rooftops, while cars and shipping containers have been swept through the streets.The official death toll, which is likely to rise, includes six crew members of a military helicopter that crashed on Mindanao island, south of Cebu, after it was deployed to assist in relief efforts.The aircraft went down on Tuesday near Agusan del Sur and was one of four sent to help.\"Communication with the helicopter was lost, which immediately prompted the launch of a search and rescue operation,\" the Philippine Air Force said. Later, a spokeswoman said six bodies had been recovered, believed to be of the pilot and crew.The typhoon, locally named Tino, has weakened since making landfall early on Tuesday, but has continued to bring winds of more than 80mph (130km/h).It is forecast to move across the Visayas islands region and out over the South China Sea by Wednesday.But residents across Cebu province are still reeling from the deadly floods. More than 400,000 people have been displaced by the disaster, according to a report on Wednesday by the national disaster agency.Jel-an Moira Servas, a business owner who lives in Mandaue city, told the BBC that she found herself waist-deep in water within minutes when her house became flooded. She quickly evacuated with her family, bringing only light items like food and electronics.\"Right now, the rain has completely stopped and the sun is out, but our houses are still filled with mud, and everything inside is in shambles,\" she said. \"We don't even know where to start cleaning. I can't even look at it without crying.\"Jel-an Moira ServasJel-an Moira Servas's home in Mandaue city was damaged by heavy flooding during the typhoonRafaelito Alejandro, the deputy administrator at the Office of Civil Defence told local radio station DZMM that the current challenge for rescuers was clearing \"debris and cars on the road\". Carlos Jose Lañas, a volunteer rescuer, told the BBC that despite preparing for the worst case, they were caught off-guard by the extent of the flooding. \"This is the worst flood I've ever experienced,\" the 19-year-old said. \"Almost all the rivers here in Cebu overflowed. Even emergency responders did not expect this kind of scenario.\"\"The rescue operation was too overwhelming for the emergency responders around Cebu, because there were a lot of people asking for help.\"In a Facebook post, Cebu governor Pamela Baricuatro described the disaster as \"unprecedented\".\"We were expecting the winds to be the dangerous part, but... the water is what's truly putting our people at risk,\" she said. \"The floodwaters are just devastating.\"Baricuatro declared a state of calamity in Cebu on Tuesday evening to facilitate disaster relief efforts.Most of the deaths were due to drowning, reports said. The storm has been sending torrents of muddy water down hillsides and into towns and cities.Damage to residential areas on Cebu was extensive, with many small buildings swept away and a thick carpet of mud left by the retreating floodwaters. Rescue teams took to boats to free people who were trapped inside their houses.Don del Rosario, 28, was among those in Cebu City who sought refuge on an upper floor as the storm raged.\"I've been here for 28 years, and this is by far the worst we've experienced,\" he told the AFP news agency.Moment Philippines floods move shipping containersThe Philippines is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons each year.The latest comes barely a month after back-to-back typhoons killed over a dozen people and wrought damage to infrastructure and crops.Super Typhoon Ragasa, known locally as Nando, struck in late September, followed swiftly by Typhoon Bualoi, known locally as Opong.In the months before, an extraordinarily wet monsoon season caused widespread flooding, sparking anger and protests over unfinished and sub-standard flood control systems that have been blamed on corruption.On 30 September, dozens were killed and injured after a powerful 6.9 magnitude earthquake struck the central Philippines, with Cebu bearing the brunt of the damage.Typhoon Kalmaegi is forecast to move on to Vietnam, which is already seeing record-breaking rainfall.With additional reporting by Jonathan Head, South East Asia correspondent",

    "body": "2 hours agoLucy WilliamsonMiddle East correspondent, GazaWatch: BBC's Lucy Williamson taken to east of Gaza City in IDF-led visitFrom an embankment overlooking Gaza City, there's no hiding what this war has done.The Gaza of maps and memories is gone, replaced by a monochrome landscape of rubble stretching flat and still for 180 degrees, from Beit Hanoun on one side to Gaza City on the other.Beyond the distant shapes of buildings still standing inside Gaza City, there's almost nothing left to orient you here, or identify the neighbourhoods that once held tens of thousands of people.This was one of the first areas Israeli ground troops entered in the early weeks of the war. Since then they have been back multiple times, as Hamas regrouped around its strongholds in the area.Israel does not allow news organisations to report independently from Gaza. Today it took a group of journalists, including the BBC, into the area of the Strip occupied by Israeli forces. The brief visit was highly controlled and offered no access to Palestinians, or other areas of Gaza.Military censorship laws in Israel mean that military personnel were shown our material before publication. The BBC maintained editorial control of this report at all times.The remains of Shejaiya, an eastern neighbourhood of Gaza CityAsked about the level of destruction in the area we visited, Israeli military spokesman Nadav Shoshani said it was \"not a goal\".\"The goal is to combat terrorists. Almost every house had a tunnel shaft or was booby-trapped or had an RPG [rocket-propelled grenade] or sniper station,\" he said. \"If you're driving fast, within a minute you can be inside of a living room of an Israeli grandmother or child. That's what happened on October 7.\"More than 1,100 people were killed in the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023, and 251 others taken hostage.Since then, more than 68,000 Gazans have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry there.The bodies of several hostages had been found in this area, Lt Col Shoshani said, including that of Itay Chen, returned to Israel by Hamas this week. Searches are continuing for the missing bodies of another seven hostages.The Israeli military base we travelled to is a few hundred metres from the yellow line – the temporary boundary set out in US President Donald Trump's peace plan, which divides the areas of Gaza still controlled by Israeli forces from the areas controlled by Hamas.Israel's army has been gradually marking out the yellow line with blocks on the ground, as a warning to both Hamas fighters and civilians. There are no demarcations along this part of the line yet - a soldier points it out to me, taking bearings from a small patch of sand between the grey crumbs of demolished buildings.EPAHamas fighters pictured on Wednesday in Gaza City (image brightened for clarity)The ceasefire is almost a month old, but Israeli forces say they are still fighting Hamas gunmen along the yellow line \"almost every day\". The piles of bronze-coloured bullet casings mark the firing points on the embankments facing Gaza City.Hamas has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire \"hundreds of times\", and Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry says more than 240 people have been killed as a result.Col Shoshani said that Israeli forces were committed to the US-led peace plan, but that they would also make sure that Hamas no longer posed a threat to Israeli civilians, and would stay as long as necessary.\"It's very clear to everyone that Hamas is armed and trying to control Gaza,\" he said. \"This is something that will be worked out, but we're far from that.\"Moose Campbell/ BBCBuildings in Gaza City have been reduced to grey, dusty rubble (image brightened for clarity)The next stage of the US-led plan requires Hamas to disarm and hand over power to a Palestinian committee overseen by international figures including President Trump.But rather than give up its power and weapons, Col Shoshani said, Hamas was doing the opposite.\"Hamas is trying to arm itself, trying to assert dominance, assert control over Gaza,\" he told me. \"It's killing people in broad daylight, to terrorise civilians and make sure they understand who is boss in Gaza. We hope this agreement is enough pressure to make sure Hamas disarms.\"Israeli forces showed us a map of the tunnels they said that soldiers had found beneath the rubble we saw – \"a vast network of tunnels, almost like spider's web\" they said – some already destroyed, some still intact, and some they were still searching for.What happens in the next stage of this peace deal is unclear.The agreement has left Gaza in a tense limbo. Washington knows how fragile the situation is - the ceasefire has faltered twice already.The US is pushing hard to move on from this volatile stand-off to a more durable peace. It has sent a draft resolution to UN Security Council members, seen by the BBC, which outlines a two-year mandate for an international stabilisation force to take over Gaza's security and disarm Hamas.But details of this next stage of the deal are thin: it's not clear which countries would send troops to secure Gaza ahead of Hamas disarmament, when Israel's troops will withdraw, or how the members of Gaza's new technocratic administration will be appointed.President Trump has outlined his vision of Gaza as a futuristic Middle Eastern hub, built with foreign investment. It's a far cry from where Gaza is today.Largely destroyed by Israel, and seen as an investment by Trump, the question is not just who can stop the fighting, but how much say Gazans will have in the future of their communities and lands.More on the Israel-Gaza war",

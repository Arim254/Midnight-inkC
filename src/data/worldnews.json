    "body": "14 hours agoSam Hancock and Hugo Bachega,Middle East correspondent  ReutersAt least 13 people have been killed in an Israeli strike near a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon, the country's health ministry says.The Israeli military said it had targeted members of the Palestinian armed group Hamas \"operating in a training compound... in the Ein el-Hilweh area\". It said the location was used by Hamas to plan and carry out attacks against Israel, which Hamas rejected as \"fabrication and lies\".Israel has carried out regular air strikes on people and places in Lebanon since a deal to end the conflict with the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah. Most strikes have targeted Hezbollah but Israel has also attacked Hamas in the country.As well as those killed, Lebanon's health ministry said at least four people had been injured in the strike.Images showed emergency workers at the entrance of Ein el-Hilweh, the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon.Footage online also showed ambulances rushing through the narrow streets of the crowded camp as a huge plume of smoke billowed from the location hit.Initial reports said the strike hit an area outside a mosque that is usually busy at night. Condemning the attack, Hamas said it had \"no military installations in the Palestinian camps in Lebanon\" and that the site targeted was an \"open sports field\".In its statement, the IDF said \"prior to the strike, measures were taken to reduce the chance of harm to civilians, including the use of precision munitions, aerial observations, and additional intelligence information\".Hamas attacked southern Israel from Gaza on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages. Israel's military response has killed at least 69,169 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated after the Lebanese group fired rockets at Israeli positions the day after 7 October 2023. Hezbollah said it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.Israel and Hezbollah fought an escalating conflict for 13 months that culminated in an intense Israeli bombing campaign and ground incursion into southern Lebanon in October 2024.Lebanese authorities said Israel's attacks killed about 4,000 people there - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israeli authorities said more than 80 of its soldiers and 47 of its civilians were killed in the hostilities.",

    "body": "The family of a Muslim man, who was lynched by a Hindu mob in India's Uttar Pradesh state in 2015, say they will continue fighting for justice after authorities recently moved to drop all charges against the accused. Mohammad Akhlaq, then 50, was beaten to death after rumours spread that he had stored and consumed beef, a claim his family continues to deny. Slaughter of cows is a sensitive issue in India as the animal is considered sacred by Hindus, who comprise 80% of the country's 1.2 billion people. Uttar Pradesh is among the 20 states with strict laws banning cow slaughter and the sale and consumption of beef.The attack, which took place in Dadri - 49km (31 miles) from the capital Delhi - was the first major and widely reported case of cow-related violence in India and sparked widespread protests. Akhlaq's family's lawyer told BBC Hindi that 18 people were charged for various offences, including murder and rioting. All of them are out on bail.Now the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led state government of Uttar Pradesh has asked a local court to drop the charges against the men. In an application filed last month, the public prosecutor argued there were \"inconsistencies\" in the witness testimonies in identifying the accused and asked the court to close the case. The court is expected to decide on whether it would accept the application on 12 December. The news has shocked Akhlaq's family, who say they are prepared to challenge the government's plea. \"We never thought that our fight of 10 years would be attempted to be closed off like this,\" his younger brother Jaan Mohammad told BBC Hindi. The family left the village shortly after the killing and has not returned.\"Now, we are scared for our safety even more,\" Mr Mohammad said. \"Will this [move to withdraw the case] not embolden the criminals?\" Mr Mohammad says he will never forget the night his brother was murdered. Akhlaq had been sleeping with his 22-year-old son Danish on 28 September 2015, when a mob wielding sticks, swords and cheap pistols barged into their home, accusing the family of having slaughtered a cow and eating it. The family said it later found out that the mob attacked him after an announcement was made from a Hindu temple that someone had slaughtered and eaten a cow. The accused men found some meat in the fridge that the family insists was mutton, and held it as proof. While Akhlaq died on the spot, his son was seriously injured in the attack.The case sparked widespread outrage. Although initial arrests came within a week, the chargesheet took three months to file.Many also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for speaking about the incident days after Akhlaq's death, while some BJP members, then in power at the federal level, were accused of defending the attackers.One party leader had described the lynching as an \"accident\", while another said consuming beef was unacceptable. The police, in its first chargesheet, named 15 main accused, including a juvenile and a local BJP leader's son, along with 25 witnesses. Four more accused were later added, bringing the total to 19; one died in 2016.Last month, the Uttar Pradesh government argued that witnesses, including Akhlaq's family, had given conflicting statements during the investigation.It noted that Akhlaq's wife initially named 10 people in her complaint, while his daughter Shaista cited 16, and his son Danish 19.\"Despite both the parties living in the same village, the witnesses have changed the number of accused,\" the application says.Mohammad Yusuf Saifi, Akhlaq's family lawyer, said the \"chaos and confusion\" at the time of the incident made it understandable that not every witness saw all involved.\"The only thing to see is whether there is any evidence against the people who have been named,\" he said. The application also noted that police seized five sticks, iron rods and bricks from the accused, but found no firearms or swords, contrary to what Akhlaq's wife had stated in her complaint.It further stated that officials had recovered beef from the scene. In 2016, a  case was filed against Akhlaq's family under the cow slaughter law - and is still pending before a court in Uttar Pradesh. The family has however has repeatedly denied the allegation.Mr Saifi, alleged the case was meant to \"pressurise\" the family, noting that a local veterinary report identified the meat as goat, not cow. As the family anxiously waits for the court's verdict, they are holding out hope. \"I still have faith in the court,\" Akhlaq's brother, Mr Mohammad, said. \"I believe justice would be done one day.\"",

    "body": "At least 20 people have been killed including two children in a Russian drone and missile attack on the western city of Ternopil that hit two blocks of flats, Ukrainian officials say.Another 66 people were wounded, 16 of them children, police said, in one of the deadliest Russian strikes on western Ukraine since the full-scale war began in February 2022.Two other western regions were hit, Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk, and a drone attack targeted three districts of the northern city of Kharkiv, wounding more than 30 people. Photos posted online showed buildings and cars ablaze. Power cuts were affecting a number of regions across the country, Ukraine's energy ministry said.Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia had fired more than 470 drones and 47 missiles, leaving \"significant destruction\". He warned that people could be trapped under the rubble in Ternopil.The devastation caused by the Russian strikes on Ternopil soon became clear. A video shared by Zelensky showed that one of the two blocks of flats had completely caved in. The interior minister Ihor Klymenko said it had been destroyed between the third and the ninth floor.Plumes of smoke poured from windows and small fires burned outside the tenement. A giant smoke cloud rose in the distance behind the Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Ternopil, as sirens blared throughout the city. Energy facilities, transport and civil infrastructure were damaged elsewhere in western Ukraine.The energy sector came under attack in Ivano-Frankivsk region where two of three people reported wounded were children. The head of Lviv region said an energy facility had been struck. The Russian strikes came a day after Ukraine's military said it had fired US-supplied longer-range Atacms missiles at military targets inside Russia, the first time they have admitted using the Atacms on Russian soil.Russia's defence ministry accused Ukraine of firing four of the missiles at the southern city of Voronezh but said they had all been shot down by air defences. Meanwhile, Zelensky is heading to the Turkish capital Ankara, in an attempt to revive a US bid to end the war. He will hold talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan amid reports that President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff has been working on a plan with Russian counterpart Kirill Dmitriev.The Kremlin said no Russian representative would be joining the talks in Ankara. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on a media report that the US and Russia had been secretly working on a peace plan for Ukraine.\"In this case, there is nothing new that we can inform you about,\" Peskov told journalists on Wednesday.His comments came amid reports that Zelensky was due to meet two top US army officials in Kyiv on Thursday. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and Army Chief of Staff General Randy George are the most senior US military officials to visit the Ukrainian capital since President Donald Trump took office, Reuters reports. In a separate development, Romania's defence ministry said a Russian drone had flown for about 8km (5 miles) through its airspace in the early hours of Wednesday. The drone then crossed into Ukraine and Moldova before returning to Romania, it said.Romanian and German air force planes were scrambled in response to the incursion and the defence ministry said it was unclear where the drone had come down.Poland also deployed jets early on Wednesday and temporarily closed two airports in the southeast in response to the strikes in western Ukraine.As the fourth anniversary of the start of Russia's full-scale invasion approaches next February, Moscow and Kyiv remain fundamentally opposed in their views of how to end the war.Earlier this month Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russia's conditions for a peace deal had not changed since Putin laid them out in 2024.",

    "body": "A portrait by the Austrian artist Gustav Klimt was sold for $236.4m (£179m) in New York on Tuesday, making it the second most expensive piece ever sold at auction. Six people took part in a 20-minute bidding battle for the Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer which was painted between 1914 and 1916. Auction house Sotheby's has not disclosed the buyer's identity.The portrait was looted by the Nazis and almost destroyed in a fire in World War Two, but was rescued in 1948. The artwork was returned to Lederer's brother, Erich, a friend and subject of Klimt's contemporary, Egon Schiele. The piece remained in Lederer's possession for most of his life, before he sold it in 1983, according to Sotheby's. The painting shows Lederer, an heiress and the daughter of one of Klimt's patrons, wearing a white robe and standing in front of a blue tapestry covered in Asian motifs. The Nazis, who annexed Austria in 1938, looted the Lederer art collection but left family portraits behind, says the National Gallery of Canada. Estée Lauder heir Leonard A Lauder made it part of his private collection in 1985, where it was displayed in his Fifth Avenue home in New York. Tuesday's sale shot past expectations, with the painting predicted to sell for  $150m before the auction. The second highest sale for a Klimt on record was Lady with a Fan, which sold for $108.8m in 2023 in London. Several other Klimt works in Lauder's collection were auctioned at the same event, including Flowering Meadow and Forest Slope at Unterach am Attersee, which fetched between $60m and $80m each. The most expensive artwork ever sold at auction was Salvator Mundi, attributed to  Leonardo da Vinci, which sold in 2017 for $450.3m.Tuesday also saw a sculpture of a fully functioning gold toilet by the conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan picking up $12.1m just an hour after the record-breaking Klimt sale.The 101-kg toilet received just one bid. Sotheby's said that the buyer was a famous American brand.",

    "body": "Nearly every Republican in the US House of Representatives voted on a bill  to compel the release of documents tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The lone \"nay\" came from the Republican lawmaker from Louisiana, Clay Higgins, who defied his party saying his vote was a principled \"NO\".\"What was wrong with the bill three months ago is still wrong today,\" Higgins wrote on X. \"It abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure in America.\"The resounding vote in favour of the Epstein bill, 427-1, marks a rare moment of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill. Hours later, the US senate too approved the legislation, clearing the way for the final act - President Donald Trump's signature. For Higgins, safeguarding the personal information of Epstein's many victims was the primary issue with the legislation.\"As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people – witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc,\" he wrote on X. \"If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt.\"  Higgins said he would support the bill if it were to be amended by the Senate, which Republican majority leader John Thune had already suggested was unlikely. \"When a bill comes out of the House 427 to 1 and the president said he's going to sign it, I'm not sure that amending it is in the cards,\" Thune said before the Senate's unanimous approval for the bill on Tuesday.Prior to the House passing the legislation, only four Republicans had joined all Democrats in signing a petition to force a vote - Thomas Massie, Lauren Boebert, Nancy Mace and Marjorie Taylor Greene.But it achieved overwhelming Republican support after President Trump dropped his opposition to a vote.Higgins has represented Louisiana's third district since 2017 and is widely regarded as one of the most conservative members of Congress, according to his website.His holdout vote in the wake of 200-plus members of his party voting otherwise is not the first time he has taken an unorthodox stance.In 2024, House Republicans voted to censure Higgins for offensive remarks he made on social media after he called Haiti \"the nastiest country in the western hemisphere\" and referred to Haitians as \"eating pets\" and \"slapstick gangsters\". \"All these thugs better get their mind right and their ass out of our country before January 20th,\" Higgins wrote.Facebook removed two posts from Higgins in 2020, after he wrote he would \"drop any 10 of you where you stand\", referring to any armed protesters that might attend a Louisiana demonstration against police brutality.Facebook told Business Insider at the time the posts \"were removed for violating our policies against inciting violence\". Before Congress, Higgins was a member of Louisiana's St Landry's Parish Sheriff's Office. He resigned in 2016 amid backlash about a controversial anti-crime video where he was seen holding a rifle and making threats against gang members. The BBC has contacted Higgins's office for comment.

    "body": "Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are meeting in Ankara on Wednesday, as the Ukrainian president said he wanted to \"intensify\" peace negotiations.\"Bringing the end of the war closer with all our might is Ukraine's top priority,\" Zelensky said, adding that efforts would also focus on resuming prisoner exchanges.It was unclear whether representatives from the US would join. Special envoy Steve Witkoff was rumoured to take part in the talks, but hours before the meeting was meant to take place his attendance had not been confirmed. Turkey has maintained ties with both Kyiv and Moscow and has previously hosted talks between the two factions.But no Russian representative is set to join the meeting in Ankara, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday.He added that while there were \"no concrete plans\" for Vladimir Putin to speak to either the Turkish side or to US special envoy Steve Witkoff, the Russian president was \"of course open to a conversation\".Ankara will be the fourth capital Zelensky visits in only a few days. In Athens he secured a gas deal, in Paris he signed an agreement to obtain up to 100 fighter jets and in Madrid he held talks on co-operation with Spanish arms manufacturers.The visits are part of Zelensky's mission to try to shore up European support for Ukraine while Russian attacks on the country intensify and Moscow's troops close in on the key city eastern city of Pokrovsk.Domestically, Zelensky is facing the most serious crisis in years. Several members of his closest circle are under investigation for co-organising a large-scale criminal scheme, and two ministers have resigned. The scandal threatens to widen still and some EU leaders – who in December will decide whether to unblock a €140bn (£121bn) loan for Kyiv based on frozen Russian state assets – have warned Zelensky needs to do more to tackle corruption. As the fourth anniversary of the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 inches closer, Moscow and Kyiv remain fundamentally opposed in their views of how to end the war.Earlier in November Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russia's conditions for a peace deal had not changed since Putin laid them out in 2024.At the time, the Russian president demanded that Kyiv renounce any ambition to join Nato, as well as full Ukrainian withdrawal from the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.Zelensky has repeatedly argued that withdrawing from Donetsk and Luhansk – together known as the Donbas – would leave the rest of the country vulnerable to future attacks.Following a long meeting with Putin in April, Witkoff - the US special envoy - appeared to suggest that a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv hinged on the status of the contested Ukrainian regions as well as Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014. This stance led to tensions with Zelensky, who accused him of \"disseminating Russian narratives\". Zelensky and Witkoff have not met since early September. Although the summer saw a flurry of high-level talks and meetings - including between Trump and Putin - American efforts to bring a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine closer have stalled.At one point, it appeared Trump and Putin were about to meet again in Budapest –but that summit was scrapped, apparently after the US side became aware that Moscow had no intention of budging from several demands that were unacceptable to Kyiv.But contact between US and Russian officials has continued, albeit under the radar. Putin's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev was reportedly in Washington for meetings with Witkoff in late October, only days after Trump imposed sanctions on Russia's two biggest oil companies.",

In the summer of 2023, he started working from Germany.According to the statement by prosecutors, Hezbollah has been running \"an extensive drone programme for some time\".Following Hamas's 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, prosecutors said Hezbollah had \"systematically fired rockets and explosive-laden drones at both military and civilian targets in Israel\".\"By June 2024, it had built up an arsenal of over 10,000 [drone] units.\"To procure such drones \"the organisation employs foreign operatives who covertly purchase components in Europe and export them to Lebanon\", prosecutors said.Fadel Z is accused of purchasing materials and products for drone construction worth around €1.4m (£1.2m), until he was arrested in July 2024.The products came from companies in Europe, China and the US.According to prosecutors, these included more than 2,000 petrol and electric motors, and over 600 propellers.Fadel Z is said to have often used front companies registered in his own name or that of his contacts to place orders. Suppliers were also paid via these companies.Prosecutors say he also arranged for the goods to be transported to Lebanon - where the group is based - either by container ship from ports in Hamburg or Spain or by air freight.Two of the engines purchased by Fadel Z were used in explosive drones that Hezbollah fired at Israel, they added.One of the drones was flown into a retirement home in the town of Herzliya, near Tel Aviv, on the night of 11 October 2024, the Jewish Holy Day of Yom Kippur.Although the explosive device detonated inside the building, none of the 200 or so residents was injured.The Federal Prosecutor's Office said it considered this to be aiding and abetting attempted murder.The trial at the regional court in Celle is expected to last until August next year.Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated after Hezbollah fired rockets at Israeli positions the day after Hamas's attacks on Israel in October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah fought an escalating conflict for 13 months. It culminated in an intense Israeli bombing campaign and ground incursion into southern Lebanon in October.Lebanese authorities said Israel's attacks killed about 4,000 people there - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israeli authorities said more than 80 of its soldiers and 47 of its civilians were killed in the hostilities.",

    "body": "19 hours agoMansur Abubakar,Abuja, Natasha Booty and Chris Ewokor,BBC Africa, AbujaTwo girls, who were among at least 25 children and a teacher kidnapped from their boarding school in north-western Nigeria's Kebbi state on Monday, have managed to escape, a local official told the BBC.The pair ran away as their armed captors were leading them into the bushes and got away across farmland, Hussaini Aliyu of Danko Wasagu council said. He added that the girls were \"back and are safe\", but one of them needed medical treatment as she had hurt her leg while fleeing.The assault left two members of staff dead - a teacher was killed while trying to protect girls and a security guard later died in hospital from gunshot wounds.A team of soldiers, police and volunteers are combing forested areas in an attempt to rescue the captives seized by the gunmen.\"You must continue day and night fighting. We must find these children,\" Maj Gen Waidi Shaibu, Nigeria's army chief of staff, told troops sent to Kebbi state.Over the past decade, schools in northern Nigeria have become frequent targets for armed groups, who often carry out abductions to seek ransom payments or leverage deals with the government.Police say the gunmen, described locally as \"bandits\", invaded the Government Girls Comprehensive Secondary School in Maga town at about 04:00 (03:00 GMT) on Monday.Parents face an agonising wait. One inconsolable father, whose daughter is still being held captive, told BBC Hausa that his family had been crying non-stop and \"it's hard to go back home and look at their faces\".He said he had two daughters enrolled at the school one of whom had successfully hid from the attackers, but the other had not been so lucky.\"My two daughters hid in the toilet when the armed men invaded their hostel.\"When the [gunmen] ordered all those hiding to come out, or else they'll kill them, one of my daughters got scared and came out,\" the father said.He added that he had heard of the abductions after the Muslim early-morning prayer on Monday, and had rushed to the school and been there ever since.\"My daughter is a very bright and easy-going person,\" he said.Police say the attackers \"engaged police personnel on duty in a gun duel\" before climbing over the perimeter fence and taking the girls from their hostel.The security guard who died had a granddaughter and great-granddaughter at the same school and they are among those kidnapped.It has devastated his family.\"I found him in his pool of blood,\" the security guard's daughter told the BBC. \"Then they took my daughter and also my granddaughter.\"She said she had been unable to eat or sleep ever since.The attack highlights the persistent security crisis plaguing the region, leaving families in a state of fear. Nigeria's central government says it is \"deeply concerned\" by the abductions. In a statement on Monday, Information Minister Mohammed Idris Malagi said the authorities \"share in the pain\" of the affected families and were working urgently to rescue the girls.He added that President Bola Tinubu remained \"unwavering in his commitment to protect every Nigerian, especially schoolchildren\".",

    "body": "Ex-Harvard president Larry Summers steps back from public role after Epstein email release1 day agoMax MatzaReutersFormer Harvard University president Larry Summers has said he will step back from public commitments after his emails with disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein were made public.\"I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognise the pain they have caused,\" he said in a statement to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. Emails released by a House committee last week show Summers, a former US treasury secretary, communicated with Epstein until the day before the Epstein's 2019 arrest for the alleged sex trafficking of minors.On Tuesday, House members are expected to vote on a measure calling for the release of all Epstein-related files that have yet to be made public.The measure would then head to the Senate, and require the approval of US President Donald Trump.Summers served as treasury secretary under former President Bill Clinton and director of the National Economic Council under former President Barack Obama. He was president of Harvard from 2001 to 2006 and is currently a professor there.He wrote in his statement on Monday: \"I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein.\"He added that he wanted \"to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me\".\"While continuing to fulfil my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort,\" Summers wrote.The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington where Summers was a senior fellow, also announced on Monday that he was no longer affiliated with the organisation.Summers is still listed as a member of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI's board, which he joined in 2023 following a failed attempt to oust its chief executive Sam Altman. The BBC has contacted OpenAI and a representative for Summers about whether he will remain a director at the company.Summers' move comes after the US Department of Justice announced that it would investigate Epstein's \"involvement and relationship\" with former President Bill Clinton, who was also a friend of Epstein, and several other prominent Democrats.Clinton has strongly denied he had any knowledge of Epstein's crimes. The department's decision came at the urging of Trump, who also asked for Summers, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and banks JP Morgan and Chase, to be investigated.Hoffman is yet to comment. A spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase said the firm regretted \"any association\" it had with Epstein, and added that it \"did not help him commit his heinous acts\".Trump was also mentioned in the emails, which do not imply any wrongdoing.\"Epstein was a Democrat, and he is the Democrat's problem, not the Republican's problem!\" he wrote on social media.\"They all know about him, don't waste your time with Trump. I have a Country to run!\"The emails released by the House Oversight Committee last week indicate that Summers and Epstein met for dinner frequently, with Epstein often trying to connect Summers to prominent global figures. At one point, in July 2018, Epstein proposed a meeting with the \"president [sic] of united nations, interesting person for you\".In a separate email just after Trump's first election in 2016, Summers told Epstein to \"spend zero effort on anything about me with Trump\".Due to Trump's \"approach to conflict of interest\", Putin \"proximity\" and \"mindless response\" to Cuban leader Fidel Castro's death, Summers said he was \"best off a million miles away\".A representative for Summers previously told US media that he \"deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein\" after Epstein's conviction in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor.The emails mention many high-profile figures. A review by the Wall Street Journal found Trump was mentioned in more than 1,600 of the 2,324 email threads.Trump has repeatedly said he severed contact with the financier years before Epstein was convicted in 2008, and was unaware of his criminal activity. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.While Trump was discussed in some of the messages released last week, he did not send or receive them.",

    "body": "Two Miss Universe judges have resigned days before the annual beauty pageant, with one of them accusing organisers of rigging the selection process.Lebanese-French musician Omar Harfouch, who announced his resignation from the eight-member jury on Instagram, alleged that an \"impromptu jury\" had pre-selected finalists ahead of the competition, set to be held on Friday in Thailand.Hours later, French football manager Claude Makélélé also announced he'd pulled out, citing \"unforeseen personal reasons\".The resignations come two weeks after several Miss Universe contestants walked out of a pre-pageant event over controversial comments made by an official from host nation Thailand.\"An impromptu jury has been formed to select 30 finalists from among the 136 participating countries, without the presence of any of the real [eight] members of the jury, including me,\" Mr Harfouch wrote in an Instagram post on Tuesday, saying he had discovered this via social media.The unofficial jury comprises \"individuals with a significant potential conflict of interest due to some personal relationships with some of the Miss Universe contestants\", he claimed.Mr Harfouch did not elaborate on how this \"impromptu jury\" would function, or how it would override the official jury's decision.Watch: Miss Universe contestants stage walkout after organiser berates Miss MexicoThe Miss Universe Organisation on Tuesday put out a statement to rebuff Mr Harfouch's claims, saying that \"no external group has been authorised to evaluate delegates or select finalists\". It suggested that Mr Harfouch may have been referring to the Beyond the Crown programme: a \"social impact initiative\" that operates independently from the Miss Universe competition, and has a separate selection committee. The Miss Universe Organisation announced the Beyond the Crown selection committee on Monday. In its statement on Tuesday, the organisation said that Mr Harfouch's allegations had \"mischaracterised\" the programme.Mr Makélélé, who also announced his resignation via Instagram, described it as a \"difficult decision\". \"I hold Miss Universe in the highest regard. The platform represents empowerment, diversity, and excellence - values I have always championed throughout my career,\" he wrote.The beauty pageant drew backlash earlier this month after its Thailand director Nawat Itsaragrisil publicly berated Miss Mexico, Fatima Bosch, at a pre-pageant event for not posting promotional content on her social media platforms.In videos that have since gone viral, Ms Bosch and several other contestants could be seen walking out of the event, and some could be heard shouting at Mr Nawat.Mr Nawat later claimed that some of his words were misunderstood - but his conduct nevertheless prompted a stern rebuke from the Miss Universe Organisation, which has since sent a delegation of international executives to take over running the competition.",

    "body": "8 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseWatch: Trump says Saudi crown prince \"knew nothing\" about Jamal Khashoggi's murderUS President Donald Trump said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \"knew nothing\" about the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as he welcomed the kingdom's de facto ruler to the White House.Trump's comments appeared to contradict a US intelligence assessment in 2021 which determined the crown prince had approved the operation that led to Khashoggi's death at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. The crown prince, who has denied any wrongdoing, said at the White House that Saudi Arabia \"did all the right things\" to investigate Khashoggi's death, which he called \"painful\".It was his first US visit since the assassination, which sent shockwaves through the US-Saudi relationship. In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump shot back at a reporter who asked a question about the killing. \"You're mentioning someone that was extremely controversial,\" the US president said. \"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about. Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen.\" \"But he [the Crown Prince] knew nothing about it,\" Trump added. \"You don't have to embarrass our guests.\"The crown prince added that Saudi Arabia \"did all the right steps\" to investigate the murder, which he called \"painful\" and a \"huge mistake\". A US intelligence report made public in 2021 - under President Joe Biden's administration - determined that the crown prince had approved of a plan to \"capture or kill\" Khashoggi in Istanbul. During his first administration, Trump White House officials declined to release the report. While dozens of Saudi officials faced sanctions in the wake of the assassination, none directly targeted the crown prince.Hanan Khashoggi, Jamal Khashoggi's widow, speaks to BBC after Trump defends Saudi crown princeReacting to Trump's comments, Khashoggi's widow, Hanan, told BBC Newsnight the US president's defence of the crown prince did not match up with bin Salman's own acknowledgment of responsibility for her husband's murder.\"The crown prince himself, in 2019 and 60 Minutes interview, he did take accountability about and hold responsibility about this horrible crime,\" she said.In a post on X, she also called for a meeting with the crown prince and an apology along with compensation for her husband's murder.Granted political asylum in the US, she lives in the Washington DC area.Tuesday's meeting between Trump and Mohammed bin Salman was expected to include deals on civilian nuclear power, artificial intelligence and Saudi investment in the US, which the crown prince said was being upped to $1tr (£761bn) from $600bn pledged earlier this year. Echoing Trump's own words, bin Salman said that the US was the \"hottest country on the planet\" and praised the US president for creating \"long-term opportunity\". The two men also discussed the potential sale of advanced F-35 fighter aircraft to the Saudis. Trump said that while export licences were still being announced, he expected a deal between the Saudis and US defence giant Lockheed Martin. The potential sale has caused alarm among some Israeli officials, who have said that it could potentially hurt the country's \"qualitative military edge\" in the Middle East, where it is so far the only nation to have F-35s. The US president said the model sold to the Saudis would be broadly similar to the one the Israelis operate.\"This [Saudi Arabia] is a great ally, and Israel is a great ally,\" Trump said. \"I know they'd like you to get planes of reduced calibre.\"But as far as I'm concerned, I think they are both at a level where they should get top of the line,\" he added. The crown prince's visit to Washington continues with a gala dinner on Tuesday night, followed by an investment summit on Wednesday. Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo - who plays in the Saudi professional league - was also present at the dinner. Biden did not host the crown prince and vowed to make Saudi Arabia a \"pariah\" over its human rights record. In 2022, however, Biden visited the kingdom to reach agreement on other issues. ",

    "body": "24 hours agoJon DonnisonCorrespondent, JerusalemAt least 94 Palestinian prisoners and detainees have died in Israeli custody in less than two years, a well-regarded Israeli human rights group says.A new report by Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI) alleges a practice of \"systematic killings and cover-ups\".The report covers the period between 7 October 2023, when Hamas launched its deadly attack on Israel, sparking the latest conflict in Gaza, and 31 August 2025. It said fewer than 30 Palestinians died in Israeli custody in the 10 years prior.The Israel Prison Service (IPS) told the BBC it \"operates in accordance with the law and under the supervision of official oversight bodies\".It said it did not comment on figures or allegations from outside bodies.\"All inmates are held according to legal procedures, and their rights including access to medical care, hygiene, and adequate living conditions are upheld by professionally trained staff,\" the IPS added.Since 7 October 2023, thousands of Palestinians have been detained across Gaza and the West Bank, many without charge.PHRI said it had exposed a deeply concerning pattern of systematic human rights violations committed against Palestinians detained by Israel and classified as \"security prisoners\".It said this was carried out as part of an official policy implemented by Israeli authorities since the war began.Israeli authorities have stopped providing information about Palestinians in custody to the Red Cross and barred access to detention facilities.PHRI said its report is based on official records and data cross-referenced with forensic reports, information from other human rights groups and efforts to locate specific people, as well as testimony from detainees, their families and lawyers.Its authors say 52 of those who died were being held in military prisons while 42 died in civilian jails run by the IPS.PHRI says the deaths were caused by physical violence, medical neglect, or both.It singles out the policies of Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel's right-wing national security minister and a key member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government.PHRI said that, under Ben-Gvir's control, Israel's incarceration facilities holding Palestinians had \"effectively been transformed into sites of torture and abuse\".It added daily physical violence was widespread, and that the deprivation of human rights and systematic torture had resulted in the deaths of dozens of Palestinians.The highest number of deaths, 29, occurred at the Sde Teiman military prison in Southern Israel, near Gaza.Five Israeli reservist soldiers have been charged with aggravated abuse and causing serious bodily harm, after a Palestinian prisoner was allegedly beaten and stabbed in the rectum with a sharp object at Sde Teiman in July 2024.Footage emerged showing reserve soldiers taking a detainee aside and surrounding him with riot shields before he was allegedly attacked. The five reservists deny the charges and have not been named.The alleged assault has divided the nation, with some right-wing politicians criticising a military police investigation and even some \"right to rape\" protests outside the jail.The PHRI report accuses the Israeli authorities of trying to \"cover up\" and suppress investigations into Palestinian deaths and alleged abuses in custody.In said that, in many cases, detainees' family members were not notified that their relatives had died and access to post-mortems was denied.The report also said there had been a failure to prosecute Israeli prison staff and soldiers.It examined a policy of what it called \"forced disappearance\", through which thousands of Palestinians have been detained without their families being notified or told where their relatives are being held.PHRI said these \"grave violations of international law\" had made determining the full scope of Israel's prisoner policy and the fate of the many Palestinians taken into custody extremely difficult, if not impossible.The group estimates the actual number of Palestinians killed could be higher than the number it has been able to document.The IPS said \"the claims described do not reflect the conduct or procedures of the Israel Prison Service, and we are not aware of the incidents as presented\".It continued: \"Every death in IPS custody is examined in accordance with established procedures and referred to the competent authorities as required.\"For reasons of privacy, security, and legal limitations, the IPS does not provide personal or statistical details regarding inmates, nor does it comment on individual cases.\"The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it operates \"in accordance with Israeli and international law\", and \"detains individuals in Gaza when there is reasonable suspicion of their involvement in terrorist activities\".It said that, in some cases, criminal proceedings were then initiated, while in others \"preventive detention is enforced to remove individuals from the fighting, in full alignment with the Israeli law and the Geneva Conventions\". \"Detention orders and their duration are subject to judicial review as required by law,\" it added.The IDF said it was aware of incidents of detainees dying in custody, but that these included people detained with existing illness or injury, adding each death was investigated by military police.",

    "body": "Georgina RannardClimate and science reporter, Belém, BrazilCOP30 host Brazil has created 10 new Indigenous territories, with the climate summit hit by protests in recent days.The designation means the areas, including one in part of the Amazon, will have their culture and environment protected under Brazilian law - though this is not always enforced.The move follows similar actions from President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, whose government recognised Indigenous possession of 11 territories last year. \"Each and every indigenous territory in Brazil is a reason to celebrate and is a reason for us to feel happy,\" Dinamam Tuxu from the group Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB) told the BBC at COP30.The latest measure will be formalised through a presidential decree. Mr Tuxu said APIB wants more lands to be recognised legally, giving groups the right to control what happens to the land within the borders.\"Indigenous peoples today protect 82% of the world's biodiversity. If you demarcate indigenous lands, you guarantee this area will be protected,\" he said.\"The traditional way of life of indigenous peoples protects the lands and automatically guarantees global warming will be tackled. Consequently the entire humanity benefits from it,\" he added.Some indigenous groups are attacked when they try to defend their land from cattle ranchers or groups trying to cut down trees for agriculture.On Sunday an indigenous leader from the Guarani Kaiowá community in the south of Brazil was killed during an attack, according to Survival International.Vicente Fernandes Vilhalva, 36, was shot in the head when gunmen surrounded the village, according to eyewitnesses who spoke to Survival International.Thousands protested on Saturday outside the UN's annual climate conference, with some carrying signs reading \"demarcation now\".And last week, demonstrators - some of whom were from Indigenous groups - carrying signs that read \"our forests are not for sale\" broke into the summit and tussled with security.Security around the conference has since increased noticeably, with more armed soldiers and police at the entrance. Lots of Indigenous groups do not have accreditation to go inside.But this remains the COP with the highest number of representatives from indigenous groups.\"This makes me very happy. We worked for two years and now we have at least 900 people inside the COP where they can negotiate and represent their communities,\" Kleber Karipuna, from APIB, told BBC News.More than 200 human rights groups wrote to UN officials on Monday criticising the enhanced security, saying it \"contributes to an increasing global trend towards the silencing of dissent, militarised response to protest, and marginalisation of those defending land and the environment\".Past recognition of Indigenous reserves banned mining and logging, as well as restricting commercial farming, in the areas they covered to prevent deforestation. Expanding the total area considered Indigenous territory could prevent up to 20% of additional deforestation and reduce carbon emissions by 26% by 2030, according to a study by the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil, the Amazon Environmental Research Institute and the Indigenous Climate Change Committee.The new protected areas span hundreds of thousands of hectares and are inhabited by thousands of people from the Mura, Tupinambá de Olivença, Pataxó, Guarani-Kaiowá, Munduruku, Pankará, and Guarani-Mbya indigenous peoples.One area overlaps more than 78% with the Amazon National Park, part of the bio-diverse rainforest which plays a crucial role in regulating the global climate and storing carbon.The Brazilian government's announcement came on Indigenous Peoples' Day at COP30 on Monday.Until the left-wing Lula re-entered office, no new Indigenous lands had been declared since 2018, it said.Under his far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, who promoted mining on Indigenous lands, the protections afforded to them were frequently not enforced.Lula's government has previously taken action to drive out illegal miners from indigenous lands.Currently, Indigenous lands encompass 117.4 million hectares - roughly equivalent to the size of Colombia, or around 13.8% of Brazil's territory. Hundreds of Indigenous groups live in Brazil, according to the country's census.The Amazon rainforest is already at risk of a renewed surge in deforestation as efforts grow to overturn a key ban to protect it. Thick and healthy forestry helps pull carbon out of the atmosphere.Carbon released through the burning of fossil fuels has contributed to climate change.Countries are gathering at COP30 in an effort to reach agreements on how to try to limit global average temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and keep them \"well below\" 2C.The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says a large body of scientific evidence shows that warming of 2C or more would bring serious consequences, including extreme heat, higher sea levels and threats to food security.",

    "body": "12 hours agoRaghvendra RaoBBC Hindi, BiharSeraj AliLalmunni Devi, who lost her husband to toxic liquor in 2022, says alcohol abuse upended her lifeNine years after imposing a statewide alcohol ban to curb addiction, domestic violence, and financial ruin among its poorest families, Bihar - India's poorest state - still struggles to gauge the policy's effectiveness.The gaps in implementation became glaring as the BBC shadowed Bihar officials in a misty October morning raid on bootleggers.Armed excise officers, with a sniffer dog, sped across the Ganges on a boat to raid an illegal distillery.On reaching the outskirts of the capital, Patna, the team found a ramshackle setup of a dozen metal drums - part of a makeshift apparatus fermenting jaggery, a type of cane sugar, into country liquor.Vapour rose from the drums embedded in the riverside mud, the surfaces still warm.The officers said the site was active minutes earlier, but the alcohol-makers had fled by the time they arrived. \"They often get tipped off before a raid,\" an officer who didn't wish to be named said. Despite these enforcement gaps, alcohol prohibition remains firmly in place in Bihar.Passed in 2016 by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar after persistent demands from women's groups, the law was among the factors that helped his Janata Dal (United) - Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alliance clinch a decisive state election victory earlier this month.State officials tout the policy's success by pointing to big numbers: since the law took effect, 1.1 million cases have been registered and 650,000 people convicted for violations. But the devil lies in the detail.More than 99% of these convictions are for consumption, rather than production, selling, or transport of illicit liquor. Moreover, alcohol remains widely available in the black market in Bihar. In the six weeks leading to the recently held election, illicit alcohol worth more than 522 million rupees ($6.26 million, £4.96 million) was seized from across the state. Seraj AliA makeshift setup of metal drums fermenting jaggery into country liquorSo why has Bihar been unable to enforce its ban more effectively?Local police, who did not want to come on record, say it is a combination of several factors - including staff shortages, increasingly sophisticated smuggling methods and possible collusion between liquor makers and authorities.\"There are laws that prescribe life imprisonment or even the death penalty for murder. But does that stop people from committing murder? No, it doesn't,\" said Ratnesh Sada, an outgoing minister whose department handled prohibition issues.Mr Sada, however, insisted that action has been taken against at least a hundred individuals engaged in illegal alcohol trade, with their properties seized.\"We destroy these setups, but within days they are up and running again,\" said Sunil Kumar, an excise official.Bihar's geography makes enforcement even harder. The landlocked state borders Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and West Bengal -  all of which allow alcohol and serve as major sources of smuggled liquor. It also shares a 726km (449 mile), largely porous border with Nepal, which officials say has become a key conduit for alcohol smuggling, further complicating enforcement.Seraj AliBihar has a thriving black market in locally-brewed alcoholDespite the challenges, many women in Bihar -  who still carry deep scars from their husbands' alcohol abuse -  want the ban to continue.In Chhapra district, Lalmunni Devi, who lost her husband after he consumed toxic liquor in 2022, said her life had been upended by alcohol abuse.\"I just hope no one else has to suffer the same fate,\" she said.Neetu Devi, another widow, broke down as she recalled her husband's death.\"If the government were to shut down all such factories entirely, it [liquor] would no longer be available. It continues to be produced, and that's why people keep consuming it,\" she said.Rajeev Kamal Kumar, an anthropologist at Patna's AN Sinha Institute of Social Sciences, who worked on a government study of prohibition, says both sides of the story are true.\"Many women and elders say prohibition has improved household finances, children's education, and nutrition. But it is undeniable that illegal trade continues,\" he said.Bihar is neither the first nor the only Indian state to impose prohibition; several others have tried it over the years. But such measures often trigger unintended consequences - from thriving black markets and deaths from illicit brews, to enforcement challenges that drain state resources.The financial cost has also been considerable, as alcohol taxes remain a key source of revenue for many state governments.Gujarat and Nagaland have had bans since 1960 and 1989, yet both still grapple with bootlegging.Mizoram imposed prohibition in 1997, lifted it in 2015, reinstated it in 2019, and then relaxed it again in 2022 to allow the manufacture, sale and export of wine made from local grapes.Some other states have rolled back prohibition after encountering economic and administrative challenges.For now, with the outgoing government slated to return to power, prohibition will remain in Bihar. But the policy remains a paradox - hailed as a social reform by some, criticised as ineffective by others.Whether it has succeeded or merely shifted the problem underground is a question that continues to haunt the state.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "Baby Shark: How a 90-second clip created a $400m business13 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesWhen Kim Min-seok gave the go-ahead in June 2016 to publish a 90-second clip of a children's song, he had no idea what he was unleashing.It became a global phenomenon, clocking up more than 16 billion views - YouTube's most watched video ever.That song was the incredibly catchy Baby Shark.Not only has it captivated toddlers and terrorised adults around the world, it laid the foundations for its creator Pinkfong to become a media business worth hundreds of millions of dollars.“We didn’t expect it to stand out from our other content,\" Mr Kim, Pinkfong's chief executive, told the BBC from the firm's headquarters in Seoul.\"But looking back, it became a major turning point that set the stage for our global journey.”Getty ImagesPinkfong chief executive Kim Min-seok at the firm's stock market listing ceremonyOn Tuesday, that journey took Pinkfong to the South Korean stock market, where its shares rose by more than 9% on their debut, giving it a valuation of more than $400m (£304m).'We didn't expect a salary' Founded in 2010 as SmartStudy, the firm made digital content for children up to 12 years of age. It had just three employees, including Mr Kim and the firm's chief technology officer, Dongwoo Son.\"The office was tiny - even smaller than this,\" recalled Mr Kim, gesturing to the conference room he was calling from.It was so small \"we didn't even expect a salary at the time\", he said through a translator.Getty ImagesThe firm was renamed Pinkfong after its cheerful and curious fox character in 2022Pinkfong went through several major overhauls, including shifting its focus to toddlers.The firm grew to around 100 employees and prioritised simpler, learning-based games and content. \"And that's when Baby Shark emerged,\" Mr Kim said.The firm has been known as The Pinkfong Company since 2022, a name inspired by a cheerful and curious fox that featured in one of its early cartoons.It now has around 340 employees, with offices in Tokyo, Shanghai and Los Angeles.The Baby Shark momentBaby Shark is believed to have originated in the US in the 1970s and was often sung at children's summer camps.The song, which repeats the phrase \"Baby shark, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo\" is \"attractive for children, though possibly annoying for adults,\" said media analyst Kevin Chew from the Nanyang Technological University. Mr Kim is also very aware of just how catchy it is.\"It's like a K-pop song. It's very fast-paced, rhythmical and it's addictive,\" he said, adding that the tune has a \"chanting\" effect, which makes it easy for children to remember.But it was not an instant hit and only gained traction when its dance routine was featured at children's events in South East Asia.Videos of children and adults dancing to the song started to spread online and the clip went viral.There was a \"festival-like feeling\" in the Pinkfong office, as the team watched its viewing numbers soar, Mr Kim said.In November 2020, the Baby Shark clip claimed the title of YouTube's most viewed.It generated around half of the firm's revenue in the years immediately after the video's release and became a springboard for new content and merchandise, he said.Baby Shark: It's got a catchy tune and plans for world domination - but the toddler hit is older than you thinkBut Pinkfong faced a legal challenge in 2019 when it was accused of plagiarising the work of an American composer.South Korea's Supreme Court rejected the case, after the company argued that its version was derived from a folk song in the public domain.The victory, Mr Kim said, gave the firm a lift as its shares went public. He added that the stock market application had been filed before the verdict was announced.One-hit wonder?Pinkfong's other franchises like Bebefinn and Sealook are growing fast but the firm must prove its success is not just reliant on Baby Shark, said Korea University business lecturer Min Jung Kim.The company's target audience is a major plus as toddlers tend to watch the same material repeatedly, she said. Kim Min-seok insists his business can grow beyond Baby Shark, which currently accounts for about a quarter of Pinkfong's revenue. Meanwhile, Bebefinn has leapt ahead, generating roughly 40% of the firm's earnings.One parent told the BBC that his family has mixed feelings about Pinkfong's videos.Father of two Saleem Nashef said he appreciates the educational qualities of the firm's content but his wife thinks Baby Shark is \"too over-stimulating for kids\". Still, the viral video is apparently inescapable, as his daughter, who is about to turn three, will have a Baby Shark-themed birthday party.Whether Pinkfong can create other characters to match Baby Shark's commercial appeal remains unclear, said Prof Kim.It raised almost $52m in its stock market debut and plans to use the money to expand its line-up of films and characters, said Mr Kim.The company also aims to become a \"tech-driven\" content creator, using viewing patterns and other data to shape its new projects.Pinkfong has already achieved \"what many creators have always dreamed of,\" Mr Kim said.But now it must show investors that it is not just a one-hit wonder.",

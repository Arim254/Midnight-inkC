    "body": "The head of Britain's richest family, Gopichand Hinduja, has died aged 85.Known as GP, Mr Hinduja and his family made their fortune from the Indian conglomerate Hinduja Group, which operates in 11 sectors including finance, media and entertainment, and oil.It has about 200,000 staff around the world.The family said in a statement: \"He will leave a deep hole at the heart of our family.\"They added that he would be \"remembered for his formidable work\".Mr Hinduja helped transform his father's modest textile and trading businesses into a global conglomerate and one of India's largest companies.Lord Karan Bilimoria, founder of Cobra Beer, said he would be remembered as someone who \"personified\" the links between India and the UK.\"Whether it was in banking, whether it was in manufacturing, whether it was in property, they were always putting the UK and India together\"GP was not only a famous and respected individual in the UK and India but a great champion for our two countries. We shall miss him greatly.\"Mr Hinduja and his family topped the most recent Sunday Times Rich List with a net worth of £35.3bn. They also ranked 11th on the Forbes list of India's 100 richest businesspeople in 2024.Mr Hinduja was the second eldest of four brothers who controlled the business for decades.The oldest of the four, Srichand, died in 2023 at 87.It is not known who will now take over the leadership of the conglomerate. The youngest brother, Ashok, runs its operations across India including truck maker Ashok Leyland.The Hinduja conglomerate operates in 48 countries.The family also own significant real estate in London, including a number of large homes near to St James's Park and Winston Churchill's Old War Office in Whitehall, which has recently been refurbished to include a hotel.Mr Hinduja largely kept out of the public eye but was involved in the controversial \"Hinduja affair\" in 2001.Mr Hinduja had written to Mandelson about his brother Prakash obtaining British citizenship, after the family's charity had donated £1m to the Millennium Dome, for which Mandelson was responsible.Mandelson resigned as a minister as a result, but was later cleared of wrongdoing after an inquiry. Prakash, his wife, their son and his wife were jailed by a Swiss court last year for exploiting domestic staff in their Geneva mansion.",

    "body": "15 hours agoGetty ImagesA search and rescue operation continues for the rest of the group, which includes other foreign nationals and local guidesDiwakar Pyakurel & Phanindra Dahal,BBC Nepali in Kathmandu and Kathryn ArmstrongAt least seven climbers, including five foreigners and two Nepalis, have died after being hit by an avalanche on a Himalayan peak in north-eastern Nepal, expedition agency Seven Summit Treks said.The incident happened at 09:00 local time (03:15 GMT) on Monday near the base camp of the Yalung Ri mountain in Dolakha district. Rescuers located two bodies, and are still searching for the remaining five, who are believed to have been buried by snow. Eight others have been rescued and are in the capital Kathmandu getting treatment for their injuries.All these climbers were part of a group that set out over an hour before the avalanche hit, the district police chief told BBC Nepali. The bodies of the other five deceased climbers \"may be 10-15 feet below the snow\", said Mingma Sherpa, chairman of Seven Summit Treks. \"It will take time to find them.\"Those killed include two Italians, a Canadian, a German, a French national, and two Nepalis who served as guides. Local deputy superintendent of Police Gyan Kumar Mahato told the BBC on Monday that a rescue helicopter had landed in the Na Gaun area of Dolakha - a five-hour walk from the Yalung Ri base camp.One of the injured climbers told The Kathmandu Post that they had repeatedly called for help, to no avail. \"Had the rescue arrived on time, more lives could have been saved,\" he told the newspaper.Mr Mahato told reporters that rescue efforts were hampered by poor weather and logistical issues, which made it hard to fly helicopters or reach the site on foot.The Kathmandu Post reported that the group were preparing to climb the nearby Dolma Khang peak, which has an elevation of 6,332m (20,774ft). They had planned to climb the 5,630m Yalung Ri as part of their acclimatisation schedule.Separately, the bodies of two Italian climbers who went missing while attempting to scale another mountain in Nepal have been recovered, officials have confirmed.Stefano Farronato and Alessandro Caputo were part of a three-man group that became stranded along with three local guides last week on the Panbari mountain in western Nepal. The third member of the group, named in media reports as Velter Perlino, 65, was able to be rescued, along with one sherpa.The group had been granted permission to climb the 6,887m peak, but were reported missing when they lost contact with the base camp following heavy snowfall on 28 October.\"When a helicopter was sent yesterday [Monday] to the Panbari peak for rescue operations, it could not find them, but rescued one Italian team leader and a sherpa from the base camp,\" Himal Gautam, department of tourism director, said. Their bodies were recovered on Tuesday and have been flown to Kathmandu.Autumn is a popular season for trekkers and mountaineers in Nepal as weather conditions and visibility have tended to be better. However, the risk of severe weather and avalanches remains. Last week, Cyclone Montha triggered heavy rain and snowfall across Nepal, stranding people in the Himalayas. Two British and one Irish woman were among a group that had to be rescued after being trapped for several days in the western Mustang region. Severe weather also left hundreds of hikers stranded near Mount Everest in October. ",

    "body": "Suspected drone sightings have disrupted flights at airports across Belgium on Tuesday, with no flights departing or arriving at Brussels Airport - the country's busiest. Air traffic there was suspended around 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT) after a drone sighting. An hour later it briefly reopened, before closing again shortly after.Liege Airport has also been affected and it is not clear when flights will resume. Local media also reported drone sightings at the Kleine-Brogel and Florennes military airbases, local media reports.It is the latest in a string of suspected drone sightings causing disruption at European airports - including in Munich, Copenhagen and Oslo.A statement on the Brussels Airport website on Tuesday evening read: \"There are currently no departing or arriving flights at Brussels Airport due to drone sightings around the airport.\"We monitor the situation closely and will provide updates as soon as we have more information.\"Pictures taken inside the airport show what appear to be camp beds being readied for passengers.Officials at Brussels's second-largest airport, Charleroi, said air traffic was briefly halted there as a precaution too.Local media reports flights had initially been diverted to Liege - before that also closed due to suspected drone sightings.It adds that flights have since been diverted to nearby airports - including Ostend and Charleroi in Belgium, and Eindhoven and Maastricht in the Netherlands.Tuesday was the fourth night in a row that the Belgian authorities reported drone sightings over Kleine-Brogel, a major military base near the Dutch border. Belgium's defence minister, Theo Francken, said on Monday that an investigation was under way, calling it \"a clear mission targeting Kleine Broge\".Drones were also seen close to Ostend and Antwerp's Deurne airports over the weekend, according to Belgian news site VRT.

    "body": "Iran has released two French nationals who were detained there for more than three years, French President Emmanuel Macron has said.Cécile Kohler, 41 and her partner Jacques Paris, 72, have been released from Evin prison, Macron said on Tuesday, with France's foreign minister later confirming they were \"safe\" at the embassy in Tehran \"ahead of their final release\".\"I welcome this first step. The dialogue continues to allow for their return to France as quickly as possible,\" Macron said.The pair, who were arrested in May 2022 during a tourist trip, are believed to be the last French nationals held in Iran.Last month, they were found guilty of spying on behalf of both France and Israel, and were handed lengthy prison sentences, according to Iranian state media reports.A number of Europeans have been held by Iran in recent years. France has accused Iran of state hostage-taking and keeping its nationals in conditions akin to torture, something Tehran has denied. In a statement to the AFP news agency on Tuesday, the pair's Paris-based legal team said the release of Kohler and Paris had \"ended their arbitrary detention which lasted 1,277 days\". AFP said their families have insisted they are wholly innocent.Their freeing comes more than a month after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said a deal to exchange French detainees for an Iranian woman held in France was nearly complete. Iran had said Kohler and Paris could be released as part of that agreement.Mahdieh Esfandiari, who has been held in France since February on charges of promoting terrorism on social media, was released conditionally by French authorities last month.",

    "body": "9 hours agoJames GregoryPortuguese Judiciary PoliceThe sub was located 1,000 nautical miles off the coast of LisbonFour people have been detained after Portuguese authorities intercepted a narco-sub carrying more than 1.7 tonnes of cocaine in the mid-Atlantic.The semi-submersible vessel was bound for the Iberian peninsula and was seized in recent days, according to officials.Footage shows the police and navy surrounding the vessel before boarding, seizing the Class A substance and arresting four crew members, who are said to be from South America.The suspects, including two Ecuadorians, a Venezuelan and a Colombian, were remanded in pre-trial custody after their court appearance in the Azores on Tuesday, said police.Vítor Ananias, head of Portugal's police unit to combat drug trafficking, told a press conference that their different nationalities showed the organisation behind them was not just based in one country.The Lisbon-based Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre (MAOC) said it had received information in recent days indicating that a criminal organisation was in the process of dispatching a submersible loaded with cocaine destined for Europe.A few days later, a Portuguese ship successfully located the submersible approximately 1,000 nautical miles (1,852km) off the coast of Lisbon, in an operation backed by the UK's National Crime Agency and the US Drug Enforcement Administration.Having seized the vessel, the navy said it could not be towed back to shore due to poor weather and its fragile construction, and it later sank in the open sea.Portuguese navyThe Portuguese navy said the narcosub was too fragile  to be towed to port and ended up sinking in the seaVítor Ananias told reporters that \"between the heat, the vessel's fumes and high waves, with difficult weather conditions, even one day is tricky [for the four men on board]. By the end of 15 or 20 days all you want is to get out\".Such incidents like these had been a \"recurring situation in recent years\", he added, in remarks quoted by Lusa news agency.In March this year, a similar vessel carrying 6.5 tonnes of cocaine was seized about 1,200 nautical miles from Lisbon. It also comes as the Trump administration ramps up its attacks on vessels it says  are being used to smuggle drugs into the US. Three men were killed last week in a US strike on an alleged drug vessel in the Caribbean, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Sunday.Experts have questioned the legality of such strikes under international law and they have drawn strong criticism from Latin American leaders whose citizens have been targeted.Watch: Moment Portuguese police enter narco-sub carrying 1.7 tonnes of cocaine in Atlantic",

    "body": "4 hours agoLana LamSydneyGetty ImagesReddit is one of the latest platforms to be added to Australia's social media banPopular forum site Reddit has been added to Australia's world-first social media ban for children under 16 that starts next month.Live-streaming platform Kick will also be included, bringing the number of sites targeted in the ban to nine. They include Facebook, X, Snapchat, TikTok, YouTube, Instagram and Threads.From 10 December, tech companies can be fined up to A$50m ($32.5m; £25.7m) if they do not take \"reasonable steps\" to deactivate existing accounts for under-16s and prohibit new ones.Each banned platform was chosen as their \"sole or a significant purpose is to enable online social interaction,\" the government said, and more sites may be added given the \"fast-changing\" nature of technology.\"Delaying children's access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,\" said Australia's eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant.Messaging services Discord and WhatsApp and gaming platforms Lego Play and Roblox will not be included, nor will Google Classroom and YouTube Kids.Federal Communications Minister Anika Wells said the online platforms can target children with \"chilling control\" and the ban was about protecting children.\"We aren't chasing perfection, we are chasing a meaningful difference,\" she said.It is unclear how companies will implement the ban - which is being closely watched by global leaders - but some of the potential methods include using official ID documents, parental approval and facial recognition technology. Critics have raised concerns over data privacy and the accuracy of age verification software, with a recent report showing the proposed methods all have risks or shortcomings. Most Australian adults support the ban, according to polls, but some mental health advocates say it may cut kids off from connection, and others say it could push youngsters to even-less-regulated corners of the internet.Instead, they say, the government should focus on better policing of harmful content on social media platforms and prepare children for the reality of life on the web.An Australian influencer family who have millions of YouTube follower recently announced their decision to move to the UK to avoid the upcoming ban, namely so their 14-year-old daughter can continue to create online content.YouTube was initially exempt from the ban but in July, the government reversed its decision, saying the video sharing site was \"the most frequently cited platform\" where children aged 10 to 15 years saw \"harmful content\".Teens under 16 will still be able to view YouTube videos but will not be permitted to have an account, which is required for uploading content or interacting on the platform.",

    "body": "16 hours agoLucy Fleming and Richard KagoeAt least 40 people in Sudan have been killed in a drone strike that targeted a funeral that was taking place outside the army-held city of el-Obeid in North Kordofan state, officials and activists say.They blamed the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for Monday's attack on al-Luweib village as mourners had gathered in a tent. The RSF has not yet commented.Many reportedly died before getting to hospital in el-Obeid, a strategic city that connects the capital, Khartoum, to the western region of Darfur.Fighting has intensified in this oil-rich Kordofan area and around 20,000 people fled to el-Obeid last week after the RSF captured Bara town, 30km (18 miles) north of the city.The town fell at the same time as the city of el-Fasher, which had been the army's last stronghold in Darfur.There have since been reports of mass killings, sexual violence, abductions and widespread looting in el-Fasher by RSF fighters.The UN said summary executions of civilians by RSF fighters had also also been reported in Bara.Such atrocities could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has warned.The RSF leader has promised to investigate \"violations\" but his paramilitary group has denied widespread allegations that the killings in el-Fasher are ethnically motivated and follow a pattern of the Arab paramilitaries targeting non-Arab populations.The ICC's statement came as a global group of food security experts confirmed on Monday that el-Fasher residents were suffering from famine following the RSF's 18-month siege of the city.The UN-accredited Integrated Food Security Phase network (IPC) also said the city of Kadugli in South Kordofan state was in the most catastrophic stage of hunger.The city, nearly 300km south of el-Obeid, has been also surrounded and starved of supplies by the RSF.UN chief António Guterres has called for an immediate halt to the violence in Sudan, warning that the humanitarian crisis is rapidly worsening.\"The horrifying crisis in Sudan... is spiralling out of control,\" he said on the side-lines of a summit in Doha.\"El-Fasher and the surrounding areas... have been an epicentre of suffering, hunger, violence and displacement - and since the Rapid Support Forces entered el-Fasher last weekend, the situation is growing worse by the day,\" AFP news agency quotes him as saying.Guterres urged the army and the RSF to come to the negotiating table and \"bring an end to this nightmare of violence\".A Sudanese government source has told AFP that the authorities are considering a US proposal for a truce.Washington - along with other states - has been pushing for a ceasefire and a roadmap to end the conflict.There have been several rounds of peace talks in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain - but they have failed - and both sides have shown an unwillingness to agree to a ceasefire.The North Kordofan Resistance Committee, a volunteer aid group, said the attack on the village, which is 15km east of el-Obeidz, happened on Monday.Mohamed Ismail, North Kordofan's humanitarian aid commissioner, told the Sudan Tribune new website: \"Drones belonging to the Rapid Support Forces militia attacked citizens who were at a funeral, resulting in the death of 40 people and the injury of dozens.\"Last week, the UN said el-Obeid was already struggling to cope with the influx of those fleeing from Bara.Since the civil war erupted between the army and RSF in April 2023, more than 150,000 people have died about 12 million have fled their homes in what the UN has called the world's largest humanitarian crisis.",

    "body": "The body of a hostage returned by Hamas via the Red Cross in Gaza has been identified as Israeli-American soldier Itay Chen, Israel has confirmed. The 19-year-old soldier's remains were returned on Tuesday as part of a Gaza ceasefire deal brokered by US President Donald Trump last month.\"Following the completion of the identification process... IDF representatives informed the family of the fallen hostage, Staff Sergeant Itay Chen, that their loved one has been returned to Israel and positively identified,\" the Israeli prime minister's office said.Earlier, Hamas's military wing said it had recovered the body of an Israeli soldier in the eastern Shejaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City.Israel had allowed members of the group and Red Cross staff to search for the remains in the area, which is inside territory still controlled by Israeli forces.Chen was working at his base on the Gaza border when Hamas and its allies launched their attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023.His family lost communication with him after he told them his base was under attack.Chen was initially believed to have been taken hostage by jihadists was actually killed in the 7 October attacks, the Israeli military said in March 2024. It said he had died in combat and his body had been taken to Gaza.The Israeli government has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the dead hostages since a US-brokered ceasefire deal took effect on 10 October.Hamas has insisted it is difficult to locate the bodies under rubble.Under the ceasefire deal, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was still holding within 72 hours.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has handed over the bodies of 270 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 19 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Five of the seven dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Earlier on Tuesday, a hospital official in Gaza City said a man was killed by Israeli fire in the Jabalia area of northern Gaza.The Israeli military said its troops killed a \"terrorist\" who had crossed the \"Yellow Line\", which demarcates Israeli-controlled territory, and posed a threat to them.",

    "body": "51 minutes agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterOnline retailers Shein, Temu, AliExpress and Wish are being investigated in France in relation to the offence of enabling minors to access pornographic content on their platforms, the Paris prosecutor said on Tuesday.The country's consumer watchdog had reported the four firms to the prosecution service on Sunday after raising concerns about the sale of childlike sex dolls on Shein's platform over the weekend.The Paris prosecutor's office told the BBC that the platforms are being investigated over violent, pornographic or \"undignified messages\" that can be accessed by minors.AliExpress told the BBC it takes the matter very seriously. Shein, Temu and Wish have also been contacted for comment.Shein and AliExpress are also under investigation over the dissemination of content related to children that are of a pornographic nature, the office said.The cases have been referred to Paris' Office des Mineurs, the prosecution service added. The office is an arm of the French police force that oversees the protection of minors.AliExpress said the listings in question violated its policies and were removed once it became aware of them.\"Sellers found to violate or trying to circumvent these requirements will be penalised in accordance with our rules,\" AliExpress said in a statement.On Monday, Shein said it had banned the sale of all sex dolls on its platform worldwide. The Singapore-based retailer also said that it would permanently block all seller accounts related to the illegal sale of the childlike dolls and set stricter controls on its platform.The French consumer watchdog, the Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control, had said the sex dolls' description and categorisation left \"little doubt as to the child pornography nature\" of the products.The scrutiny of Shein comes as the company, which was founded in China, prepares for the opening on Wednesday of its first permanent physical outlet in France.Protesters have been seen gathered in front of the Paris department store where Shein is set to open the outlet.Shein plans to open outlets in other French department stores in cities including Dijon, Reims and Angers.",

    "body": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he has visited troops near the town of Pokrovsk, where the fiercest front line battle between Russia and Ukraine is currently taking place.Zelensky posted photos showing him meeting personnel at a command post in the Dobropillya sector, some 20km (12 miles) north of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region.Kyiv's top military commander, Oleksandr Syrskiy, said on Monday that Ukraine was increasing pressure on the Dobropillya front to \"force the enemy to disperse its forces and make it impossible to concentrate their main efforts in the Pokrovsk area\".Russia has been trying to seize Pokrovsk - a strategic frontline town and logistic hub - for over a year.Although it has taken them months to approach the town's borders, Russian soldiers have now infiltrated it and on Friday, Zelensky said Russia had amassed 170,000 troops on its outskirts.Both Ukraine and Russia continue to issue claims and counter claims on the situation in and around Pokrovsk.    Capturing Pokrovsk could give Moscow access to the rest of Donetsk, including the towns Kramatorsk, Slovyansk, Kostyantynivka and Druzhkivka - the so-called \"fortress belt\". Gen Syrskiy, acknowledged his troops were withstanding the \"pressure of a multi-thousand enemy grouping\" but denied they were encircled. Meanwhile, Russian military bloggers claimed 90% of Pokrovsk was under Moscow's control. Unverified videos posted on social media show instances of close quarter combat, drone attacks and street battles there. The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said that Russian forces were operating with \"increasing comfort\" within the town, which once had a population of 60,000 but has now been almost entirely emptied of civilians and largely destroyed.Further east, Moscow's troops are also reportedly targeting the town of Myrnohrad, which would put Ukrainian soldiers at risk of encirclement. Intense drone activity has cut off many logistics routes, making evacuations and the supply of ammunition and vehicles near impossible.On Monday, Zelensky said Russia had had \"no success\" in Pokrovsk in recent days but acknowledged that \"things were not easy\" for Ukrainian forces in the area. He added that a third of all front line clashes were happening in Pokrovsk, and a half of all glide bombs used by the Russians were launched at the town. Earlier last week the Ukrainian president said that Moscow's troops in the area were outnumbering Kyiv's eight to one.Some Ukrainian commentators have criticised the government's efforts to continue to defend Pokrovsk, arguing that troops were being put at risk.In a post accompanying the pictures of his visit to Dobropillya, Zelensky on Tuesday wrote: \"This is our country, this is our East, and we will certainly do our utmost to keep it Ukrainian.\"Russia now controls 81% of the Donetsk region and 99% of neighbouring Luhansk, which collectively make up the Donbas.Moscow has never relented in its ambition to capture the entirety of the area, which Russia's President Vladimir Putin declared annexed in 2022 despite not being in full control of it.However, its progress along the front line has been grinding and occupying the heavily fortified towns in northern Donetsk could come at a huge cost of both manpower and resources.Away from the front line, Russia continues to pummel Ukrainian cities, targeting the country's energy facilities as winter draws in.A large-scale drone attack overnight Monday targeted the southern port of Odesa on the Black Sea, damaging industrial facilities, causing fires and affecting the local power supply. At least 15 civilians were killed and 44 injured in combined drone and missile attacks across the country at the weekend. Ukraine continues to hit back, mostly using drones to target industrial sites across Russia and border regions. On Tuesday, Kyiv said it had attacked a petrochemical plant in the Bashkortostan region and a refinery in the Nizhny Novgorod region, while earlier this week, a drone explosion killed a woman and injured three others in the Russian border region of Belgorod.",

    "body": "A Chinese court has sentenced five top members of an infamous Myanmar mafia to death as Beijing continues its crackdown on scam operations in South East Asia.In all 21 Bai family members and associates were convicted of fraud, homicide, injury and other crimes, said a state media report published on the court website.The family is among a handful of mafias that rose to power in the 2000s and transformed the impoverished backwater town of Laukkaing into a lucrative hub of casinos and red-light districts.In recent years they pivoted to scams in which thousands of trafficked workers, many of them Chinese, are trapped, abused and forced to defraud others in criminal operations worth billions.Mafia boss Bai Suocheng and his son Bai Yingcang were among the five men sentenced to death by the Shenzhen Intermediate People's Court. Yang Liqiang, Hu Xiaojiang and Chen Guangyi were the other three.Two members of the Bai family mafia were handed suspended death sentences. Five were sentenced to life imprisonment, while nine others were handed jail sentences ranging from three to 20 years.The Bais, who controlled their own militia, established 41 compounds to house their cyberscam activities and casinos, authorities said.These criminal activities involved more than 29 billion Chinese yuan ($4.1bn; £3.1bn). They also led to the deaths of six Chinese citizens, the suicide of one and multiple injuries, state media reported.The harsh penalties handed down by the court are part of China's campaign to eradicate the vast scam networks in South East Asia - and send a stern warning to other criminal syndicates.In September a Chinese court sentenced 11 members of the Ming family - another prominent Laukkaing clan - to death.These families rose to power in the 2000s with the help of Min Aung Hlaing - who now leads Myanmar's military government. He had wanted to prop up allies in Laukkaing after ousting its former warlord.Among the clans, the Bais were \"absolutely number one\", Bai Yingcang previously told state media.\"At that time, our Bai family was the most powerful in both the political and military circles,\" he said in a documentary about the Bai family, aired on Chinese state media in July.In the same documentary, a worker at one of their scam centres recalled the abuse he had endured there: besides being beaten, he had his fingernails yanked out with pliers and two of his fingers severed with a kitchen knife.Bai Yingcang is among those who were sentenced to death this week. He has also been separately convicted of conspiring to traffic and manufacture 11 tonnes of methamphetamine, state media reported.The families' fall came in 2023 as political winds changed.For years Beijing has pressed the Myanmar junta to rein in scam operations in Laukkaing.In 2023, the Chinese police issued arrest warrants for the most prominent members of these families. Bai Suocheng, the Bai family's patriarch, was among the warlords who were handed to Beijing from Myanmar in early 2024.\"Why is the Chinese government making so much effort to go after the four families?\" a Chinese investigator said in the July documentary.\"It's to warn other people, no matter who you are, where you are, as long as you commit such heinous crimes against the Chinese people, you will pay the price.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoGeorge Wright,in London, Virma Rivera,in Manila and Koh Ewe,in SingaporeAt least 66 people have been killed while hundreds of thousands fled their homes as one of strongest typhoons this year ripped through the central Philippines, authorities say.Typhoon Kalmaegi has flooded entire towns on the most populated central island of Cebu, where 49 of the fatalities were located. Twenty-six others are missing, a civil defence official said in a radio interview on Wednesday.Videos show people sheltering on rooftops, while cars and shipping containers have been swept through the streets.The official death toll includes six crew members of a military helicopter that crashed on Mindanao island, south of Cebu, after it was deployed to assist in relief efforts.The aircraft went down on Tuesday near Agusan del Sur and was one of four sent to help.\"Communication with the helicopter was lost, which immediately prompted the launch of a search and rescue operation,\" the Philippine Air Force said. Later, a spokeswoman said six bodies had been recovered, believed to be of the pilot and crew.The typhoon, locally named Tino, has weakened since making landfall early on Tuesday, but has continued to bring winds of more than 80mph (130km/h).It is forecast to move across the Visayas islands region and out over the South China Sea by Wednesday.Rafaelito Alejandro, the deputy administrator at the Office of Civil Defence, gave the updated casualty numbers during an interview on local radio station DZMM on Wednesday. Rescuers are waiting for the skies to clear before they can deliver aid, he said. \"The challenge is the debris and cars on the road. There is a lot for us to clear.\"\"The situation in Cebu is really unprecedented,\" provincial governor Pamela Baricuatro said in a Facebook post. \"We were expecting the winds to be the dangerous part, but... the water is what's truly putting our people at risk,\" she said. \"The floodwaters are just devastating.\"Baricuatro declared a state of calamity in Cebu on Tuesday evening to facilitate disaster relief efforts.Most of the deaths were due to drowning, reports said. The storm has been sending torrents of muddy water down hillsides and into towns and cities.Damage to residential areas on Cebu was extensive, with many small buildings swept away and a thick carpet of mud left by the retreating floodwaters. Rescue teams took to boats to free people who were trapped inside their houses.Don del Rosario, 28, was among those in Cebu City who sought refuge on an upper floor as the storm raged.\"I've been here for 28 years, and this is by far the worst we've experienced,\" he told the AFP news agency.More than 400,000 people have been displaced by the disaster, according to a report on Wednesday by the national disaster agency.The Philippines is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons each year.The latest comes barely a month after back-to-back typhoons killed over a dozen people and wrought damage to infrastructure and crops.Super Typhoon Ragasa, known locally as Nando, struck in late September, followed swiftly by Typhoon Bualoi, known locally as Opong.In the months before, an extraordinarily wet monsoon season caused widespread flooding, sparking anger and protests over unfinished and sub-standard flood control systems that have been blamed on corruption.On 30 September, dozens were killed and injured after a powerful 6.9 magnitude earthquake struck the central Philippines, with Cebu bearing the brunt of the damage.Typhoon Kalmaegi is forecast to move on to Vietnam, which is already seeing record-breaking rainfall.With additional reporting by Jonathan Head, South East Asia correspondent",

    "body": "4 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporter, OttawaCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney has put forward his first federal budget, which lays out an ambitious plan to transform Canada's economy and deal with the challenge of US tariffs.Billed an \"investment budget\" by the government, the fiscal plan increases Canada's deficit to C$78bn ($55.3bn; £42.47bn), the second largest in history. The spending is offset by plans to attract C$1tn of investment into Canada over the next five years, with the federal government arguing more restrained spending would eliminate \"vital social programmes\" and funding for Canada's future. The budget does outline cuts, however, including slashing the size of the federal workforce by some 10% in the coming years. The budget was presented by Canada's finance minister, François-Philippe Champagne, in the House of Commons late on Tuesday afternoon. In his budget speech, Champagne warned that Canada is facing \"a time of profound change\" and that \"bold and swift action is needed\" to ensure the country prospers.Peppered throughout the budget are references to uncertainty and the need for protectionist measures as a result of US tariffs on Canada. President Donald Trump has placed a broad 35% levy on Canadian goods not covered by an existing free trade agreement, and has tariffed specific sectors like steel, aluminium and automobiles. These levies, enacted earlier this year, have already led to Canadian job losses in those sectors, and business leaders have warned of a chill on investment in Canada due to trade uncertainty. To counter this, the budget proposes spending of C$280bn over the next five years \"to strengthen Canada's productivity, competitiveness, and resilience\". These include updating ports and other trade infrastructure with the goal of doubling Canadian exports to non-US markets over the next decade, as well as direct financing to support firms impacted by tariffs.The fiscal update also outlines a plan to boost Canada's competitiveness, with the goal of making Canada a more attractive place to do business than the US.Rebekah Young, the head of inclusion and resilience economics at Scotiabank, said the budget lays out a plan to reduce timelines and smooth regulatory hurdles with the hopes that it will boost private investment in Canada over the years.But she cautioned that parts of the budget might be a hard sell for Canadians struggling immediately with the cost of living.\"They're going to open this budget and not see any new (supports),\" she said. And while the budget delivers on its promise of generational spending, Ms Young said it remains to be seen if it will be as \"transformational\" as Carney hopes.\"We want to unlock a trillion dollars based on this investment here. A lot has to happen to get to that trillion,\" she said. On defence, the budget pledges nearly C$82bn over five years—the largest funding in decades—putting Canada in line with its Nato commitment to spend 2% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on its military by this year.The Carney government is also betting big on AI, proposing nearly C$1bn to boost integration and use of the rapidly growing technology, including in government operations.Carney warned Canadians ahead of the budget of \"sacrifices\". Among them is a reduction of the size of the federal government that would result in 40,000 job losses by 2029. International aid is also slated to be cut to pre-pandemic levels. Immigration targets have been lowered slightly over the next three years to \"stabilise\" new admissions to the country, including a significant cut to student visas.The budget will need to be passed by Canada's parliament before it's implemented. Carney's Liberal government is just shy of a majority, meaning it will need the support of other parties to enact its fiscal plan. Failure to pass the budget could risk a federal election. One Conservative MP, Chris d'Entremont, said in a statement released by the Liberals on Tuesday night that he had resigned from the Conservative caucus and will be crossing the floor to Carney’s party.In the statement, the MP said that the  budget “hits the priorities I have heard most in my riding“.​​This narrows Carney's razor-thin minority at a critical time.Meanwhile, Conservative opposition MPs have criticised the budget for increasing Canada's deficit while doing little to address affordability for Canadians. Yves-Francois Blanchet, the leader of the separatist Bloc Québécois party, said his caucus does not see how they could support the budget. Members of the left-leaning New Democratic Party said they will take the time to study it, but have criticised planned public sector cuts. With the projected larger deficit, Carney's fiscal plan maintains that Canada's still has the lowest deficit-to-GDP ratio in the G7, behind only Japan.",

    "body": "16 minutes agoMadeline HalpertNew York CityZohran Mamdani, 34, is the projected winner of New York City's race for mayor in a contest that rallied young voters and sparked debate about the future direction of the Democratic Party. The Ugandan-born Mamdani, a Democrat, beat former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, to become the youngest person in over a century to lead the largest city in the US. A self-described democratic socialist, he made affordability the central message of his campaign, pledging to expand social programmes paid for by new taxes on high earners and corporations.Mamdani was a relatively unknown member of New York State Assembly until his campaign gained online momentum a few months ago, propelling him to victory in the Democratic primary contest over the summer.In projections from BBC news partner CBS, Mamdani had secured 50.3% of the vote, compared with Cuomo's 41.6%. Republican Curtis Sliwa had just over 7%. Shortly after the winner was projected, Sliwa conceded.\"We have a mayor-elect,\" Sliwa told a group of supporters. \"Obviously I wish him good luck, because if he does well, we do well.\"\"We've been with them, each and every day, and we will not surrender, we will not retreat, we will not leave this city of New York.\"Cuomo also conceded, congratulating Mamdani to a chorus of boos from his supporters. \"That is not right,\" he chided.\"Tonight was their night. Our city is the greatest city in the world and we will unite for New York City because we love New York City,\" he said, pledging to help the new administration.It is a historic moment as Mamdani also becomes the first South Asian and Muslim to lead the city.But Mamdani's campaign has drawn significant national attention, including from US President Donald Trump, who in the days before the vote threatened to withhold federal funds from New York if Mamdani, whom he called a communist, won.There are questions over how he will pay for his ambitious social agenda and critics have questioned how a politician with no executive experience will handle a hostile Trump administration.On Tuesday night, Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson criticised on X  the \"consequences\" of New York City's choice. \"Zohran Mamdani's election cements the Democrat Party's transformation to a radical, big-government socialist party,\" he wrote.The president also posted on social media, blaming the shutdown, and his not appearing on the ballot, for Republican losses Tuesday night. Centrist Democrats clinched victories in elections for governor on Tuesday night, with US Representative Abigail Spanberger and US Representative Mikie Sherrill winning races to run the states of Virginia and New Jersey respectively.Mamdani's win also presents a dilemma for the Democratic establishment, which has been reluctant to endorse him. Despite that, he was favored to win New York City's election, leading Cuomo and Sliwa in the polls by double digits for weeks leading up to Election Day. A relatively unknown figure just months ago, few could have predicted his rise, from hip-hop artist and housing counsellor to the frontrunner to lead a city with a $116bn (£88bn) budget and global scrutiny.The former New York assemblyman centred his campaign on affordability in one of the country's most expensive cities, campaigning on issues like universal child care, and free and faster buses. His candidacy drew criticism from business leaders and centrist Democrats, some of whom did not endorse him, including fellow New Yorker and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Republicans have seized on his expected win to paint the future of the Democratic Party as a party of socialism. President Donald Trump has repeatedly lambasted Mamdani and threatened to withold federal funding from the city if he wins. Still, Mamdani won even after New York Mayor Eric Adams dropped out of the race after several scandals, which was expected to boost Cuomo's candidacy. ",

    "body": "3 hours agoGeeta Pandey,BBC News, Delhi and Ashraf Padanna,ThiruvananthapuramVivek NairAt the centre of the current controversy are the two gold-clad idols of door guards seen in this photo. They are placed outside the temple's main chamber  A famed Hindu temple in southern India is embroiled in a scandal after the Kerala high court said there was evidence that some of the idols have been stripped of their gold covering.Gold and silver plating of idols and temple figurines, mostly paid for by devotees, is common across temples in India. So, the theft at Sabarimala shrine, visited by millions of pilgrims every year, has stunned the devout and made headlines.The Kerala High Court has set up a special investigation team (SIT), police have begun an inquiry into the disappearance of gold and three people, including a former assistant temple priest, have been arrested.A two-judge bench that is monitoring the investigation has been holding regular hearings in the case since September and the next sitting is on Wednesday.The hill shrine, dedicated to Hindu deity Lord Ayyappa, had made headlines a few years back too. The temple bars women of menstruating age and was ordered by the Supreme Court to end this discrimination. But following protests, the court agreed to review its landmark ruling and put it on hold. The Sabarimala shrine is visited by millions of pilgrims every yearWhat has been stolen?The current controversy centres around two idols of Dwarapalakas - or the door guards that stand just outside the sanctum sanctorum where the main deity sits.The court took up the case in September after a report by the court-appointed Sabarimala Special Commissioner revealed that the idols were stripped of their gold-cladding in many places.In a series of court orders since then, Justices Raja Vijayaraghavan V and KV Jayakumar say they have looked at the records submitted by temple officials, before-and-after photographs and other documents that the SIT has gathered into \"this extraordinary case involving the pilferage of Lord Ayyappa's sacred valuables\".The judges said when they directed the temple officials to produce complete files and records relating to the repair of the idols, \"little did we realise, that we were in fact opening a hornet's nest\".Temple records show that 30.291kg gold - donated by now-disgraced billionaire businessman Vijay Mallya - was used in 1998-99 to carry out gold-cladding on the idols and several parts of the temple, including some pillars, door arches and panels depicting stories of Lord Ayyappa.The court says that in July 2019, the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) that manages the temple allowed the main suspect Unnikrishnan Potty - a former assistant priest at Sabarimala - to take out the idols for fresh gold-cladding.Two months later when they were brought back, they were not weighed, but the court says that later investigations have revealed they were a lot lighter. Further investigation by the SIT has revealed pilferage also from the pedestals and door frames and the court says that approximately 4.54kg gold has gone missing since 2019.\"A heist and plundering of gold\" - that's how the judges have described the case of the missing gold.The temple does not allow women of menstruating age so only young girls or elderly female pilgrims can visit the shrineWhat was highly unusual was that Mr Potty was allowed to take out the idols since repair work is generally done within the temple, the court noted. It added that \"while handing over the precious items to him\", the temple board had recorded gold-cladded items as \"copper plates\".The judges have also been scathing in their criticism of the temple board for \"wrongfully permitting \" Mr Potty \"to retain approximately 474.9g of gold\" after the repairs.Referring to an email Mr Potty sent to the board seeking permission to use this \"surplus gold\" for the \"marriage of a girl known or related to him\", the court said it was \"deeply disturbing and exposes, yet again, the extent of the impropriety involved\".Sabarimala is among the most popular Hindu temples in IndiaThe suspects and their denialsMr Potty has been arrested and sent to judicial custody by a magistrate and the BBC has not been able to speak to himBut on his way out from the court after his arrest, he shouted at the throng of waiting reporters that he was being \"trapped\".\"The truth will come out. Those who trapped me in this will face the law. Everything will be revealed,\" he said.In the past few days, police have also arrested two board officials. The board's president PS Prasanth, who is also under investigation, did not respond to calls or messages from the BBC.Earlier, he told reporters that \"the current board had nothing to do with the issue\" but added that he was \"fully cooperating with the investigation\" and \"hoped that all culprits would be brought to justice\".The SIT has been given six weeks to complete its investigation and the court has vowed \"to identify and bring to book every person culpable in the matter… irrespective of the position, influence or status of the person\".KB JAYACHANDRANOpposition legislators have protested outside the state assembly against the gold theftPolitical row and protestsThe scandal has also led to a political row in the state with opposition parties holding protests against Kerala's Communist government.\"About 5kg of gold has been stolen,\" Congress party's VD Satheesan, who is the leader of the opposition in the state legislative assembly, told the BBC. \"The court has expressed shock and observed that the officials are equally, if not more, culpable in the matter.\"Satheesan and other opposition politicians have demanded that the state's Minister for Temple Affairs VN Vasavan take responsibility for the failure to protect the god's valuables and resign.Vasavan has denied the allegations and rejected the opposition's call for his resignation. \"We'll be fully cooperating with the court-monitored investigation by the high-level police team,\" he told the BBC.\"Let the people be aware of all the transactions since 1998 and what's happening now. We have nothing to hide.\"",

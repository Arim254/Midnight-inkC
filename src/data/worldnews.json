    "body": "South Korean police said they will seek an arrest warrant for a woman who set fire to her apartment building while trying to kill a cockroach with an improvised flamethrower, local media reports.One of the woman's neighbours died after falling to the ground in a failed attempt to escape through a window.The woman, who is in her 20s, told police that she tried to torch the cockroach with a lighter and a flammable spray, adding that she had used the method before. But on Monday, items in her home caught fire.Police in the northern city of Osan said the woman could be charged with accidentally starting a fire and causing death by negligence.Blasting cockroaches - with blowtorches or homemade flamethrowers - has emerged as a novel way of getting rid of house pests, made popular by videos on social media.In 2018, an Australian man set fire to his kitchen while trying to kill cockroaches with a homemade flamethrower made from insect spray.The woman who died in the Osan city fire, a Chinese national in her 30s, lived on the fifth floor of the building with her husband and two-month-old baby.When they realised that a fire had broken out, the couple opened their home window and called for help.They handed their baby through the window to a neighbour in the adjacent block before trying to evacuate themselves.The woman's husband managed to climb over to the next block. She tried to do the same, but fell from the window. She was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead hours later.Police said they believed the couple had tried escaping through the window because thick smoke from the fire had blocked the stairway, local media report.The building houses commercial shops on its first floor and 32 residential units from its second to fifth floor.Eight other residents suffered from smoke inhalation because of the fire.",

    "body": "He also issued Combs a $500,000 (£374,000) fine and five years of probation.Combs had asked for a 14-month sentence that would have seen him released soon after the trial ended due to time spent in jail while awaiting trial, but prosecutors sought more than 11 years.At his sentencing hearing in September, Combs told a judge: \"My actions were disgusting, shameful, and sick.\"\"I got lost in excess, I got lost in my ego,\" he said. He begged the judge for \"mercy\" and apologised to two of the women who testified against him.His legal team signalled they would appeal both Combs' conviction and the judge's sentence.Combs was arrested in September 2024 and his nearly two-month trial this summer drew international media attention.Prosecutors accused him of using his powerful position in the music industry to run what amounted to a sex trafficking operation, and coercing his girlfriends to participate in so-called \"freak-offs\" with male escorts.Much of the case centred on his relationship with the singer Cassandra Ventura, who alleged Combs physically abused her and forced her to engage in \"hotel nights\" with male escorts. Another woman, who testified under the pseudonym Jane, said she felt pressured to participate in similar encounters even if she was unwell.A jury found Combs not guilty of the two most serious charges – sex trafficking and racketeering. But they did find him guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.",

    "body": "1 day agoLana LamSydneyCSIRO/Cindy BesseyThe new species of porcelain crab was found more than 100m below the ocean's surfaceA semi-transparent crab about the size of an almond and a tiny, glowing lantern shark are among two new species discovered by Australian scientists exploring the deep sea.In late 2022, scientists from Australia's science agency CSIRO embarked on a research voyage in the Gascoyne Marine Park, about 20km (12 miles) off the coast of Western Australia.Australia is one of the world's biggest biodiversity hotspots, home to more than a million different species, many of which are not found anywhere else on earth.But - like much of the globe - large swathes of its water remain unexplored, and the animal and plant life within them unknown to science.Among the hundreds of specimens collected during the 2022 voyage was the newly described West Australian Lantern Shark. Growing up to 40cm, it has large eyes and a glowing belly, and was found more than 600m below the ocean's surface.\"Lantern sharks are bioluminescent, with light produced by photophores located on their belly and flanks, which is where their common name comes from,\" Dr Will White, a fish scientist, said.CSIROThe West Australian lantern shark has large eyes and can grow up to 40cmThey also discovered a new type of porcelain crab, about 1.5cm in length and found about 122m below sea level. They use hairs to catch food, instead of their claws.\"Porcelain crabs are known as filter feeders, feeding on plankton by using modified mouthparts with long hairs to sweep the water for small pieces of food such as plankton, rather than the typical crab method of grabbing and pinching food with their claws,\" said Dr Andrew Hosie, curator of aquatic zoology from the Western Australian Museum.About 20 new species have been unearthed as a result of the voyage so far, including the Carnavon Flapjack Octopus, a rusty red creature around 4cm big.Researchers estimate about 600 more are yet to be described and named, as it can take years for scientists to gather the information to prove they're unique.",

    "body": "Mosquitoes have been found in Iceland for the first time after the country experienced record-breaking heat this spring.Insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason encountered the mosquitoes over several nights last week while using wine-soaked ropes to observe moths, local media reported.Mr Hjaltason found two female mosquitoes and one male which were later confirmed to be Culiseta annulata, one of few species that can successfully survive winter.Iceland was one of only two mosquito-free havens in the world prior to the discovery, partly due to its cold climate. The only other recorded mosquito-free zone is Antarctica.The mosquitoes were found in Kjós, a glacial valley to the South West of the Icelandic capital of Reykjavik.Mr Hjaltason shared the news of his discovery on a Facebook page for local wildlife alongside pictures of the insects, describing \"a strange fly on a red wine ribbon\", according to Icelandic media.\"I could tell right away that this was something I had never seen before\" he said in the post, which was screenshotted and shared by Iceland's Morgunblaðið news site, adding \"the last fortress seems to have fallen.\"Mr Hjaltason sent the insects to the Icelandic Institute of Natural History to be identified, where entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson confirmed his suspicions.The species are common across parts of Europe and North Africa but it it isn't clear how they reached Iceland, Alfreðsson told CNN. Iceland's cold climate and lack of stagnant water in which the insects can breed are key contributors to the country's former lack of mosquitoes, the World Population Review said.But this year, the country broke multiple records for its high temperatures. Typically, Iceland rarely experiences highs of more than 20C (68F) in May, and when it does those heatwaves will last for no more than two to three days, its Met Office notes. That threshold was exceeded for 10 consecutive days this year in different parts of the country, though.Iceland also saw its hottest ever day in May, with temperatures reaching 26.6C (79.8F) at Eglisstaðir Airport.A June study published by the Global Heat Health Information Network noted that such shifts could have \"significant\" impacts on delicate ecosystems, which have adapted to the cold climate and are sensitive to temperature shifts.Last year was the world's hottest on record, and the UN's climate body has established that human influence has \"unequivocally\" warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land.Further monitoring will be required in spring to see if the mosquito species has \"truly become established in Iceland\", Alfreðsson added.Hjaltason, meanwhile, has speculated on the origin of the specimens he observed.\"One always suspects Grundartangi - it's only about six kilometers from me, and things often arrive with ships and containers, so it's possible something came in that way,\" he told Morgunblaðið.\"But if three of them came straight into my garden, there were probably more.\"",

    "body": "At least 39 people have been killed in an oil tanker explosion in Nigeria's central Niger state after the vehicle skidded off the road and crashed, spilling fuel, an aid worker has told the BBC.Another 60 people with varying degrees of injuries are currently receiving treatment at a hospital, said Abdullahi Baba Ara, head of the Niger state emergency service.Villagers rushed to collect fuel from the overturned tanker which suddenly exploded, setting off a massive fire that engulfed them. Tanker explosions are a recurring tragedy in Nigeria, despite repeated warnings about the dangers of collecting spilled fuel. The intense blaze burned many victims beyond recognition, and the injured were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.The accident occurred near the Essan and Badeggi communities along the Bida-Agaie road in the Katcha Local Government Area of Niger state.The Nigerian truckers risking attackDriver of burning fuel tanker honoured for heroismNiger State Governor Mohammed Umaru Bago sent his condolences to the people, describing the incident as \"worrisome, unfortunate and pathetic\".\"[It] is disheartening how people have continued to approach a fallen tanker to scoop its contents\" despite several awareness campaigns, said a statement by his chief press secretary Bologi Ibrahim.The tanker, carrying petroleum products from Lagos in southern Nigeria to the north, is said to have crashed due to the bad condition of the road.Poor road conditions are a major contributor to road accidents in the country.In October last year, a fuel tanker explosion killed 153 people in Jigawa state, north-west Nigeria.In January this year, a truck carrying about 60,000 litres of petrol overturned near Suleja, also in Niger state, killing at least 86 people and injuring nearly 70 others.",

    "body": "1 hour agoBasillioh Rukanga and Maia DaviesWatch: Four vehicles were involved in the crash on a major highway on the Kampala-Gulu HighwayForty-six people have been killed after several vehicles crashed on a major highway in Uganda, the police say.The police revised down an earlier death toll of 63, saying they had mistakenly included victims who were unconscious and were now being treated.The crash occurred when two buses travelling in opposite directions \"met head on\" while trying to overtake two other vehicles – a lorry and a car – on the Kampala-Gulu Highway at 00:15 local time (21:15 GMT), the Uganda Police Force said.One of the buses swerved in an attempt to avoid a crash, but in the process caused a \"head on and side collision\" that led to a \"chain reaction\" in which other vehicles lost control and overturned.As well as the fatalities, the passengers of the vehicles involved and several others were injured, police said. An investigation has been launched.The injured have been taken to different hospitals in the western town of Kiryandongo. In a statement, police said they were working with health and emergency services to verify the numbers and provide accurate updates as investigations continue into the cause of the tragedy.President Yoweri Museveni said he had learnt of the tragic accident \"with sadness\" and sent his condolences to the bereaved families. He urged caution to prevent such tragedies.He directed that each bereaved family be given five million shillings each ($1,430; £1,070) and a million shillings to the injured.The highway between the capital Kampala in the south and the northern city of Gulu is one of the country's busiest.Following the crash, police have urged motorists to avoid \"dangerous and careless overtaking\".It said this \"remains one of the leading causes of crashes in the country\".",

    "body": "25 minutes agoKhanyisile NgcoboJohannesburgSouth African authorities have suspended eight pupils linked to a case of alleged bullying that has caused national outrage.A video showing a horrific assault at Milnerton high school in Cape Town last week has been widely shared on social media.Several boys are seen repeatedly hitting a fellow pupil with various objects, including a hockey stick, hose pipe and belt. According to reports, the boy was one of nine allegedly assaulted.Bullying in schools is a significant problem in South Africa, with videos depicting the violent attacks often going viral. This latest clip is among the most horrific to emerge in recent years.Organisations and political parties have condemned the incident, which took place on 16 October, while the police have confirmed that an assault case has been opened.The mother of the 16-year-old boy being attacked in the video told local online publication, News24, that her son had had cancer and had completed his chemotherapy earlier this year.\"My child had just beaten cancer [only] for something like this to happen to him,\" she is quoted as saying.The teen's uncle later told local broadcaster eNCA that the boy had since been removed from the school.Among those to speak out was Amnesty International South Africa, which said the video was \"deeply disturbing\" and called for \"timely disciplinary action\".The video, which is just over two minutes long, shows the boy pleading with his attackers to stop hitting him. While he makes this impassioned plea, one of the boys hits him again with a belt, eliciting laughter from some of the others. Some of the boys are also seen making funny faces and cheering the boy's attackers as the camera pans across the room.\"No child should ever endure such brutality in a space where [pupils] should be safe and protected from harm,\" the international human rights organisation said in a post on X.South Africa's education ministry said it had been in contact with the Western Cape education department, which has oversight over the school, and confirmed that the suspended pupils would face disciplinary action.The provincial department said it was \"treating the matter with the seriousness it warrants\".Both bodies have urged the public not to share the video of the assault or details of those involved, saying that this \"not only exacerbates the trauma experienced by the victim but also undermines the rights and dignity of all the [pupils] involved\".The chairperson of parliament's education committee also shared her \"utter horror and deep concern\" over the video.Joy Maimela said that the incident \"is not merely bullying but borders on assault – a criminal offence that demands urgent and decisive action from all relevant authorities\".On Wednesday afternoon, outraged parents held a protest outside the school, which is still open.",

    "body": "Belize has signed an agreement to act as a \"safe third country\" for migrants as they seek asylum in the United States.The small Central American nation's Prime Minister John Antonio Briceño said the deal - which still needs approval from the Belize Senate - will mean that migrants deported from the US could apply for asylum there instead of returning to their home countries.The US State Department called it \"an important milestone in ending illegal immigration\" and \"shutting down abuse\" of the US asylum system.The agreement appears to be similar to one with Paraguay announced in August.This year Panama, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras have also taken in people deported by the US.Human rights groups in the US and abroad have strongly criticised such deals, saying migrants face the risk of being sent to countries where they could be harmed.Belize's Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted on social media that the agreement \"includes strict security measures to protect Belize's national security and sovereignty\".\"The agreement gives Belize full authority to approve or reject transfers, limits eligibility to specific nationalities, and ensures comprehensive background checks, among other measures,\" it said.Briceño told local media that for Belize it will be \"more like a job programme, whereby people with certain qualifications can come to Belize\" and \"participate meaningfully in our economy\".He added that the country - which has a population of 417,000 - would prefer to take people from Central America, adding \"we're not going to open up to the whole world\".But opposition leader Tracy Taegar Panton expressed \"grave concern\" about the deal, saying it \"could reshape Belize's immigration and asylum systems, impose new financial burdens on taxpayers, and raise serious questions about national sovereignty and security\".The US State Department posted on X that the agreement was \"an important milestone in ending illegal immigration, shutting down abuse of our nation's asylum system, and reinforcing our shared commitment to tackling challenges in our hemisphere together\". Further details of the agreement have not yet been released.Since the start of his second term, US President Donald Trump has embarked on sweeping efforts to remove undocumented migrants - a key election promise that drew mass support during his campaign.In June, the US Supreme Court cleared the way for Trump to resume deportations of migrants to countries other than their homeland without giving them the chance to raise any risks they might face with officials.

    "body": "16 hours agoDearbail JordanEPAColombia's former President Alvaro Uribe faced 12 years' house arrest for fraud and briberyColombia's former president has had two convictions for fraud and bribery overturned after he was sentenced to 12 years of house arrest.Alvaro Uribe became the first Colombian leader to be criminally convicted after a trial in August in which a judge handed the 73-year-old the maximum sentence.  The case against him was linked to claims he ordered a lawyer to bribe jailed paramilitaries to discredit claims he had ties to their organisations. Uribe has always maintained his innocence. The right-wing politician, who was president between 2002 and 2010, is best  known for waging an aggressive offensive against left-wing Farc rebels and remains an influential figure in the South American nation.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio previously criticised Uribe's conviction, arguing that his only crime \"has been to tirelessly fight and defend his homeland\".Uribe was originally convicted, in part, on testimony from a former paramilitary commander, Luis Carlos Velez, who said he had been paid bribes by the president's lawyer, Diego Cadena.But the Superior Court in the capital, Bogotá, found that the ex-commander's testimony lacked credibility. In its 700-page decision overturning the convictions, the court also found that some of the wiretaps used to open a formal investigation into Uribe had been obtained illegally. The ruling can be appealed by people classed as victims in the case.Colombia's current and first left-wing President Gustavo Petro denounced the outcome.  He wrote on X: \"This is how the history of paramilitary governance in Colombia is covered up, that is, the history of politicians who came to power allied with drug trafficking.\"Paramilitary groups emerged in Colombia in the 1980s to fight the Marxist-inspired guerrilla groups that had been battling the state since the 1960s.Many of the armed groups that developed in the conflict made an income from the cocaine trade. Deadly fighting between them and with the state has produced lasting rivalries for trafficking routes and resources.Right-wing paramilitary groups have been found responsible for massacres, disappearances and other atrocities.Some left-wing guerilla outfits have also been found to have been involved in massacres and threats against Colombian citizens, according to Human Rights Watch.",

    "body": "1 day agoBasillioh Rukanga and Shingai Nyoka,BBC AfricaA drone attack has hit an area near the international airport in Sudan's capital, Khartoum, a day before it was set to resume domestic flights for the first time since war broke out in 2023. Residents of the city reported hearing explosions in several districts early on Tuesday morning. Social media images - yet to be verified by the BBC - appear to show a series of blasts. There is no information on casualties or damage, and no-one has claimed responsibility.On Monday, Sudan's Civil Aviation Authority had announced the airport would reopen on Wednesday, months after the army recaptured Khartoum from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and began repairing the heavily damaged airport.Tuesday's strike marked the third attack in the capital within a week, following strikes on two army bases in north-west Khartoum on consecutive days last week. The Sudan Tribune news website cites a security source as saying that anti-aircraft defences had intercepted several drones after 04:00 local time (02:00 GMT) but gave no details on any damage.The international airport shut down shortly after fighting erupted between the army and the RSF in April 2023, when the paramilitary force took control of it. Sudan war: A simple guide to what is happeningSudanese city under siege: 'My son's whole body is full of shrapnel'Port Sudan, in the east, has the country's only functioning international airport, although it has been targeted by drones.Khartoum has remained relatively calm since the army retook control of the city in March, but attacks have persisted, with the RSF accused of targeting civilian and military infrastructure from a distance. Since the loss of the capital, the RSF has intensified efforts to capture el-Fasher - the army's last stronghold in the western Darfur region. The ongoing conflict has killed tens of thousands and forced millions from their homes.What started as power struggle between the army and the RSF has since drawn in other Sudanese armed groups and foreign backers, plunging the country into what the UN calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis.",

    "body": "22 hours agoLucy WilliamsonMiddle East Correspondent, JerusalemUnder Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza, the \"yellow line\" - which Israel withdrew to earlier this month - is the first of three stages of Israeli military withdrawal. It leaves it in control of about 53% of the Gaza Strip.One Israeli newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, referred to it as \"effectively the new border\" in Gaza.It's a remark that will please the far-right coalition partners of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.The fortifications and demarcations Israel is now building along this boundary are meant to clearly divide the territory, but they may also help to blur the differing hopes and expectations of Mr Netanyahu's allies in Washington and at home.How long he can keep both sets of expectations in play depends largely on this next stage of negotiations.The boundary marked by the yellow line is temporary, but further withdrawal of Israeli forces rests on resolving the difficult issues pinned to the second stage of Donald Trump's deal – including the transfer of power in Gaza and the process for disarming Hamas.Washington is keen that nothing upset this next delicate stage of negotiations. US Vice-President JD Vance flew in on Tuesday to push Netanyahu to press on with peace talks. Trump's negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner met with the Israeli PM on Monday.Israeli newspapers have been reporting that Netanyahu is receiving a stern message from his American allies to \"show restraint\" and not to endanger the ceasefire.When Israel complained that Hamas had violated the terms of the ceasefire on Sunday, killing two soldiers, the response advocated by Mr Netanyahu's far-right National Security Minister was a one-word demand: \"War\".Instead, Israel carried out an intense, but brief, wave of air strikes, before reinstating the truce, and was careful to emphasise that its troops had been attacked inside the yellow line – keen to show Washington that Israel had not broken the rules.Netanyahu has said the war will not end until Hamas is dismantled – its disarmament, and the full demilitarisation of Gaza, are among the conditions he has set.But Israeli commentators are lining up to say that the real decisions over Israel's military action in Gaza are now being made in Washington.The yellow line – and the daunting task facing negotiators in this second stage of the deal – are clues as to why Netanyahu's coalition partners have chosen to wait, rather than carry out a threat to bring down his government.The dream for many extremist settlers – and ministers – is that the next stage of this process will prove impossible to resolve and the yellow line will indeed become the de facto border, opening the way to new settlements on Gazan land. Some hardliners would like Israel to annex the whole of the Gaza Strip.The vast majority of Israelis want an end to the war and for the remaining bodies of the hostages, and Israel's serving soldiers, to come home.But Israel's prime minister is known as a politician who likes to keep his options as open as possible, for as long as possible, and this is a deal in stages, with caveats built in.Agreeing to this first stage meant withdrawing to positions that left Israel in control of more than half of Gaza, and agreeing to a ceasefire in order to get hostages home.From here, it will become harder to align the goals of his US and domestic allies.Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly underlined that violations of the deal by Hamas – including its failure to disarm – would allow Israel to return to war.\"If this is achieved the easy way, so much the better,\" he told the Israeli public earlier this month. \"If not, it will be achieved the hard way.\"Donald Trump has said the same.  But Washington has so far shown a tolerance for delays and violations in implementing the deal on the ground, leaving Netanyahu with far less political room than perhaps he'd like.",

    "body": "A Chinese woman has been charged with the theft of six gold nuggets worth about 1.5 million euros ($1.75m; £1.3m) from the Museum of Natural History in Paris last month, French prosecutors have said.The woman was arrested in Barcelona while trying to dispose of some melted gold, according to officials, and is being held in pre-trial detention.Famous for its stuffed animals and bone collections, the museum is home to a mineralogy gallery, from which the gold was taken. Police found an angle-grinder and a blowtorch at the scene.The museum's alarm and surveillance systems had been disabled by a cyber-attack, with the thieves apparently aware of this, French media reported at the time.\"The thieves, clearly very experienced and well-informed, exploited a security flaw that had not been identified during the last audit conducted in 2024,\" a museum spokesperson told French newspaper Le Figaro.Cleaners discovered the break-in when they arrived for work before dawn at the museum, which is part of the Sorbonne university and located near the Jardin des Plantes in central Paris.The suspect was arrested by Spanish police on 30 September on a European arrest warrant and handed over to French authorities on the same day, officials said in a statement.At the time of her arrest, she was in possession of around a kilogram of melted-down gold. Investigations are continuing, the statement added. It is believed she was preparing to leave for China.One of the largest stolen nuggets, originally from Australia, weighs 5kg. At the current gold price, it would be worth around €585,000.\"We are dealing with an extremely professional team, perfectly aware of where they needed to go, and with professional equipment,\" Emmanuel Skoulios, the museum director, told French broadcasters.\"It is absolutely not by chance that they went for these specific items,\" he told France 2 television last month.The charges come just days after thieves made off with priceless French crown jewels from the Louvre Museum in a separate, daring raid. On Sunday, \"professional\" thieves broke into the world's most-visited museum, stealing eight valued items before escaping on scooters. The raid took less than eight minutes, police said.Experts told the BBC that the items are likely to be broken up and sold for a fraction of their worth.\"This won't be their first heist,\" Dutch art detective Arthur Brand said of the thieves on Monday. \"They have done things before, other burglaries. They are confident and they thought, 'we might get away with this', and went for it.\"At least four French museums - including the Louvre and the natural history museum - have been robbed in recent months, according to media reports.",

    "body": "2 hours agoAnna Holligan,Hague correspondent and David GrittenThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) is to deliver an advisory opinion on Israel's legal obligations towards UN agencies and other international organisations operating in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.The UN's top court received a request from the General Assembly late last year, after Israel's parliament passed laws banning any activity by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) on Israeli territory and contact with Israeli officials.Israel accused Unrwa of being infiltrated by Hamas. The agency denied the claim, insisting it was impartial.The ICJ was asked to also cover in its opinion Israel's duty to allow the unhindered delivery of essential supplies to Palestinians.Israel tightened its blockade on Gaza after the start of its war with Hamas two years ago and has since restricted - and at times completely stopped - the entry of food and other aid for the 2.1 million population.Before this month's ceasefire deal, UN-backed global experts had estimated that more than 640,000 people were facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity and that there was an \"entirely man-made\" famine in Gaza City. Israel rejected the findings, insisting it was allowing in sufficient food. It also blames Hamas for stealing aid.The ICJ's panel of international judges was asked to clarify two questions in the resolution passed by the UN General Assembly in December.Firstly, whether Israel's ban on Unrwa breaches UN conventions guaranteeing the independence of UN agencies.And secondly, whether Israel's restrictions on aid crossings into Gaza violate international humanitarian law, including its duties as an occupying power to protect civilians.While the opinion will be a non-binding legal clarification, it carries significant moral and diplomatic weight.At the start of the hearings at The Hague in April, the UN's Under-Secretary General for Legal Affairs Elinor Hammarskjöld told the court that, as the occupying power in the West Bank and Gaza, Israel's obligations entailed \"allowing and facilitating all relevant United Nations entities to carry out their activities for the benefit of the local population\".These activities included relief schemes, such as the provision of foodstuffs, as well as caring for and educating children, and maintaining medical services, she said.She also argued that as a UN member state, Israel had legal obligations under UN conventions to uphold the privileges and immunities of the UN and its premises, property, assets and personnel so it could function properly and fulfil its mandates.\"When the basic elements of this legal framework are not observed, the very nature of the work of the organisation on behalf of its member states is in jeopardy,\" she warned.Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh, legal counsel for the Palestinian government, said Israel's \"violations of the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people, its attacks on the United Nations and on United Nations officials, property and premises, its deliberate obstruction of the organisation's work, and its attempt to destroy an entire United Nations subsidiary organ, are unprecedented\".Israel considers this ICJ procedure a \"political circus\" and \"abuse of international law and institutions\".It filed a written statement saying the court's involvement undermined its self-defence and counterterrorism rights under international law.\"No state is expected to accept or to facilitate grave risk to its citizens and territory. On the contrary, international law prescribes the right and obligation of a state in acting to defend its existence, its territory, and its people,\" the statement said.It also argued that there were no obligations for a UN member state to co-operate with a UN agency or respect its immunities \"where the legitimate security concerns of a member state are severely undermined by the agency in question\".Unrwa - the largest humanitarian organisation in Gaza, with 12,000 Palestinian staff - has challenged Israel's allegation that it knowingly has Hamas members in its ranks, or that it co-operated with the armed group.The UN said last year that it had fired nine of Unrwa's staff members in Gaza after investigators found evidence that they might have been involved in the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages.Another 10 Unrwa staff were cleared because of insufficient evidence.Israel also alleged that hundreds of Unrwa staff were members of proscribed terrorist groups, but an independent review commissioned by the UN found it had not provided evidence to support its claim.Since the Israeli laws took effect in January, Unrwa says its Palestinian staff have continued providing assistance and education, health and other services to Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. However, the agency says Israel has banned it from bringing aid into Gaza and stopped issuing visas to Unrwa's international staff.Unrwa says at least 309 of its staff and 72 people supporting the agency's activities have been killed since the start of the war in Gaza. The territory's Hamas-run health ministry says Israeli attacks during the conflict have killed at least 68,229 people in total.This is the first formal legal inquiry into whether a UN member state can lawfully exclude a UN agency from its territory.This hearing is therefore about far more than Unrwa: it is about whether the international system can still enforce its own rules when a major UN member state challenges the legitimacy of UN institutions operating under its authority.",

    "body": "2 hours agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor and John Sudworth,KyivDSNS UkraineA man was reported killed and children wounded in an attack on a kindergarten in KharkivAt least seven people have been killed including two children during intense Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukraine, officials say.A kindergarten was hit in Ukraine's second biggest city Kharkiv and there was widespread damage in Kyiv. Children were among the 27 people wounded.Hours earlier, US President Donald Trump said his plans for an imminent summit in Budapest with Russia's Vladimir Putin had been shelved as he did not want a \"wasted meeting\".President Volodymyr Zelensky said the attacks proved Moscow had not come under enough pressure for its continued war.The Kremlin has rejected calls for a ceasefire along the current front lines made both by Trump and European leaders.However, Russian officials said on Wednesday that preparation for a Trump-Putin summit was continuing, disputing the US president's assessment that it had been put on hold.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said a date had yet to be agreed upon and careful preparation was needed. He said a summit was \"the mutual desire of both presidents\" and most of the \"gossip and rumours\" surrounding it were untrue. Ukraine's president arrived in Norway on Wednesday at the start of a European trip, days after talks with Trump in Washington last Friday, when he failed to persuade the US president to provide long-range Tomahawk missiles.Zelensky told reporters in Oslo that Trump's proposal to freeze the front line was a \"good compromise, but I'm not sure that Putin will support it and I said it to the president\".The Ukrainian leader has directly linked the shelving of the planned Trump-Putin summit to his request for US Tomahawks: \"As soon as the issue of long-range missiles became a little further away for us, for Ukraine, then almost automatically Russia became less interested in diplomacy.\"Russia's drone and missile bombardment came shortly after Ukraine's military said it had attacked a Russian chemical plant in the Bryansk border region late on Tuesday with UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles.Calling the strike \"a successful hit\" that penetrated the Russian air defence system, military officials said the Bryansk plant \"produces gunpowder, explosives and rocket fuel components used in ammunition and missiles employed by the enemy to shell the territory of Ukraine\".DSNS UkraineA woman and two children were killed when their house was set alight in the village of PohrebyRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and its attacks on the Ukrainian capital overnight were the first such strikes for almost two weeks.A couple in their 60s were killed when a drone hit their high-rise building in the city, and four people were killed in the wider Kyiv region. Among the victims were a 36-year-old woman, a six-month-old baby and a girl, aged 12, when a Russian strike set fire to their house in the village of Pohreby, just to the north of the capital. A man in a nearby village later died of his injuries.Officials in Kharkiv said later that a 40-year-old man was killed and seven other people were hurt in a drone strike on a kindergarten. Children were among the six people wounded, and dozens more were evacuated, they added.Ukraine's air force said Russia had sent 405 drones and 28 missiles, 15 of which were ballistic.The capital was under a ballistic missile warning for most of the night, and echoed to the sound of explosions. By morning rescue teams fought fires in residential buildings.Across Ukraine, Russian attacks once again targeted energy infrastructure and emergency power outages were imposed in several areas.One MP in Kyiv, Inna Sovsun, told the BBC's Newsday programme that the air raids had lasted throughout the night and were definitely an attack on the power supply: \"for the majority like myself it means we don't have electricity and we don't have water.\"",

    "body": "European leaders have joined Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky in insisting that any talks on ending the war in Ukraine should start with freezing the current front line, and warned that Russia is not serious about peace.In a statement signed by 11 leaders including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, they said they \"strongly support\" US President Donald Trump's position that \"the fighting should stop immediately, and that the current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations\".But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday dismissed the idea of halting the conflict at the current contact line.Moscow was only interested in \"long-term, sustainable peace\", Lavrov said, implying that freezing the front line would only amount to a temporary ceasefire.The European statement referred to \"Russia's stalling tactics\", indicating how intractable Moscow's position remained.Trump, who has often adopted a conciliatory tone towards Russia, is now planning direct talks with Putin in Budapest - although the date for a preparatory meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Lavrov seems to be slipping. The US president spoke by phone to Putin last week, a day before meeting Zelensky and his team in the White House.Several sources have told Western media that Trump pushed the Ukrainian leader to give up large areas of territory in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, known as the Donbas, as part of a deal with Russia.Some reports suggested there had been a \"shouting match\". Zelensky only described the talks as \"frank\".The Ukrainian president has often ruled out withdrawing from the region, arguing that Russia could use it as a springboard for future attacks. \"I explained during my visit to Washington last week that Ukraine's position has not changed,\" he said on Monday.Although Russia has occupied most of Luhansk, Ukraine remains in control of about a quarter of Donetsk, including the key cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk.Trump, who later denied ever insisting that Zelensky surrender the Donbas, has since embraced the idea of a ceasefire on the current frontlines.\"Let it be cut the way it is,\" he said on Monday, referring to the contested region. \"It's cut up right now. I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia... I said: cut and stop at the battle line. Go home. Stop fighting, stop killing people.\"But Moscow continues to dismiss talk of a front line freeze.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the idea had been put to the Russians repeatedly but that \"the consistency of Russia's position doesn't change\" – referring to Moscow's insistence on the complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the embattled eastern regions.Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov repeated much the same lines on Tuesday.The \"root causes of the conflict\" needed to be addressed, Lavrov said, using Kremlin shorthand for a series of maximalist demands that include the recognition of full Russian sovereignty over the Donbas as well as the demilitarisation of Ukraine – a non-starter for Kyiv and its European partners.The Kremlin has played down expectations of an imminent meeting between Putin and Trump. \"We cannot postpone what has not been finalised,\" Peskov said.Lavrov and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio were meant to meet this week to organise the summit, but no timings have yet been given.A potential meeting between Trump and Putin in Hungary would require at least one EU country to open its air space to the Russian leader's plane. Putin is subject to an international arrest warrant for war crimes, and Poland and Lithuania have already signalled they would execute it if he were to travel through their countries.Another route into Budapest for Putin would be through Bulgarian airspace. Foreign Minister Georg Georgiev hinted Bulgaria would be willing to let the plane through.\"When efforts are made for peace, it is only logical that all sides contribute to making such a meeting possible,\" he said.Trump and Putin last met in Alaska in August during a hastily organised summit which yielded few results apart from bringing to an end Putin's status as a pariah of the West.For some time after the talks, Trump put forward the idea of organising a Putin-Zelensky bilateral summit.But Russia said such a meeting was contingent on the \"root causes\" of the war being addressed first, and the idea was eventually quietly shelved by all parties.Since starting his second term in office Trump has lamented that the Russian-Ukrainian war, now in its fourth year, is \"difficult\" to solve.",

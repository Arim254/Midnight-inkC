    "body": "8 hours agoAlys DaviesAFPChiara Ferragni told reporters she was very happy her \"nightmare\" was overAn Italian fashion influencer has been acquitted of aggravated fraud, bringing a long-running scandal involving a charity Christmas cake to an end.Chiara Ferragni had been accused of misleading consumers by promoting the sale of a designer pink pandoro as well as Easter eggs that were said to be helping to raise money for a children's hospital and a charity.After a fast-track trial in Milan, a judge found her and two other defendants not guilty. Had she been convicted, she could have faced a jail term.Ferragni, 38, told reporters the judgment marked \"the end of a nightmare that lasted two years\".The scandal - dubbed \"pandorogate\" - started with the sale of pink special edition Christmas cakes in 2022.Consumers were led to believe that sales of the pandoro would go towards raising funds for a children's hospital in Turin. But it turned out that the cake's producer, Balocco, had given a one-off €50,000 (£43,300) donation to the hospital before the cake's launch.Ferragni has 28 million followers on Instagram and, after her companies made €1m from the promotion, she pledged to donate the same sum to the hospital.The outcry led authorities to initiate a formal investigation and the influencer was handed a €1m fine in 2023 by Italy's competition authority over the pandoro cakes, branded with her name and mentioning the children's hospital.Ferragni-branded Easter eggs also became part of the scandal, leading the influencer to agree to pay €1.2m to a children's charity to settle complaints that the eggs' sales allegedly misled consumers.She was later indicted on the aggravated fraud charges, along with business associate Fabio Damato. Prosecutors had asked for a sentence of one year and eight months in prison for Ferragni but the judge rejected their accusation that the fraud should be seen as aggravated.The Milan court found that no aggravation had been involved as a consumer group had withdrawn its original complaint. Ferragni had agreed with consumer organisation Codacons that she would compensate consumers and donate money to a charity for women who had suffered gender violence.\"We are all moved,\" Ferragni told reporters at the end of the trial. \"The last two years have been very hard. I had faith in justice, and justice has been done.\"Despite her acquittal the scandal has proved damaging to Ferragni's brand and affected her personal life. Her marriage to Italian rapper Fedez fell apart last year.It has also led to tighter rules for Italian influencers to show greater transparency in their fund-raising initiatives.",

    "body": "9 hours agoPaulin KolaEPAThe community in Crans-Montana remains in shock two weeks after the fireThe Swiss canton of Valais has banned pyrotechnic devices in all indoor public venues following the devastating fire at a bar on New Year's Eve where 40 people were killed and 116 were injured.Authorities said each of the victims would get a 10,000 franc ($12,500; £9,200) emergency payment, with a fund being set up to collect donations.The canton of Geneva also announced a ban on pyrotechnics in indoor venues - days after Vaud became the first of Switzerland's 26 regions to take such a decision.The blaze at Le Constellation bar in the ski resort of Crans-Montana is believed to have started when sparklers attached to champagne bottles set light to sound-insulating foam padding on the ceiling.EPA/ShutterstockJacques and Jessica Moretti, French owners of Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, say they are co-operating with the investigationAuthorities have acknowledged that the bar had not undergone safety checks for five years.The two co-owners of Le Constallation, French couple Jacques and Jessica Moretti, have been accused of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.Jacques Moretti is being held in custody for an initial period of 90 days. His wife has had to surrender her passport and report to police every day.The news that the bar had not been inspected for five years has shocked families of the victims, most of whom were young - eight were under the age of 16.Many of the injured have severe burns. Eighty remain in hospitals in Switzerland and other European countries.One of the lawyers representing families of the victims said on Tuesday that an online platform had been launched to receive testimonies related to the disaster.\"This initiative aims to facilitate the investigation for the benefit of the victims,\" Romain Jordan said - not to replace the official investigation.Among those who have died was the waitress who was seen in a video wearing a helmet and holding a champagne bottle with a sparkler attached and the ceiling catching fire.Identified widely as Cyane Panine, 24, and from Sète in south-east France, she is said to have been close to the managers of the bar. Her family have issued a statement saying: \"Whatever the outcome of the investigation, this young woman followed her employers' instructions. She did what the general manager asked her to do. Nothing unusual. This young employee is in no way responsible.\" ",

    "body": "'Appropriate and unambiguous': White House defends Trump over middle-finger gesture at hecklerThe White House has defended US President Donald Trump after he aimed an offensive gesture at a heckler during his appearance at the Ford factory in Detroit on Tuesday.Footage of the incident published by TMZ appears to show Trump responding to a man who shouted at him from afar.The White House said: \"A lunatic was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage, and the President gave an appropriate and unambiguous response.\"The heckler has been suspended by Ford, the United Auto Workers union told the BBC's US partner, CBS News. Within 24 hours of the incident, two separate GoFundMe pages have raised nearly $700,000 (£521,000) for him from more than 27,000 donors. A Ford spokesperson told CBS: \"One of our core values is respect and we don't condone anyone saying anything inappropriate like that within our facilities. \"When that happens, we have a process to deal with it but we don't get into specific personnel matters.\"According to the subtitles provided by TMZ, the heckler called Trump a \"paedophile protector\". In the clip, which shows Trump from a distance, the president can be seen speaking back at the heckler, allegedly mouthing an expletive as well as using a middle-finger gesture.  A man who spoke to The Washington Post, named TJ Sabula, identified himself as the man who shouted. He said he had \"no regrets\" about what he did. Sabula reportedly said he his remarks referred to Trump's handling of the Epstein files. Trump has faced pressure for more transparency on what was uncovered by federal investigations into Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender.Trump signed a law that compelled the Department of Justice (DoJ) to release all the files that it held on Epstein by 19 December, although only a fraction of the files have so far been made public.Trump was once friends with Epstein before they fell out, which Trump says was years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.United Automotive Workers (UAW), the union that represents Sabula, defended his actions, saying: \"He believes in freedom of speech, a principle we wholeheartedly embrace, and we stand with our membership in protecting their voice on the job.\"Trump was in Detroit on Tuesday to give a speech to the Detroit Economic Club. The president's public use of expletives have attracted headlines in the past - for example, when discussing the relationship between Iran and Israel last June.His predecessor Joe Biden also caused controversy for uttering an expletive during a conversation with a worker during his own visit to a factory in Detroit while on the campaign trail in 2020, before he was elected president.

    "body": "Agents with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) raided the home of a Washington Post reporter this week as part of an investigation into a government contractor accused of leaking classified information, officials said. In a post on X, US Attorney General Pam Bondi said agents had searched the home of a journalist who allegedly \"was obtaining and reporting classified and illegally leaked information from a Pentagon contractor\". Bondi said the contractor had been arrested. The Washington Post identified the reporter to the BBC as Hannah Natanson, who has covered how President Donald Trump's administration has drastically reduced and reshaped the federal workforce. Natanson was at her home in Virginia on Wednesday when federal agents came to search her home, according to the Washington Post. They took her phone, a work and personal computer and a Garmin watch, the outlet said. Natanson was told she was not the focus of the probe, according to the Washington Post, which reported that officials were investigating Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a system administrator in Maryland with top-secret security clearance. According to an FBI affidavit, Perez-Lugones -  a systems engineer and information technology specialist on contract for the government since 2002 - accessed and printed classified intelligence reports. Officials said they found classified information in a lunch box while searching Perez-Lugones' car, according to court filings. The filing does not mention Perez-Lugones disseminating the information. The court filings say Perez-Lugones has been charged with unlawful retention of national defence information. He is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday. Bondi said the Trump administration would \"not tolerate illegal leaks of classified information that, when reported, pose a grave risk to our Nation's national security and the brave men and women who are serving our country\".The search of Natanson's home sparked concerns from press freedom and free speech advocates. \"Any search targeting a journalist warrants intense scrutiny because these kinds of searches can deter and impede reporting that is vital to our democracy,\" Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute, said in a statement. Natanson previously wrote about her experience gathering more than 1,000 sources who currently and formerly worked for the federal government, as she reported on the layoffs, buyouts and firings that Trump has used since returning to office to shrink the federal workforce and change the focus of many agencies.Natanson wrote about sources inside government agencies sharing information they \"weren't supposed to tell me\" and the intensity of receiving sensitive information from so many people. In April, Bondi ended Biden-era policies that had protected journalists from having their phone records seized or being forced to testify in leak probes. ",

    "body": "You must have heard of Dubai chocolate: the sticky, indulgent confectionary filled with pistachio cream, tahini and shreds of knafeh pastry, which has become a global sensation.Now the decadent bar has inspired South Korea's latest dessert craze. The Dubai chewy cookie has been selling like wildfire - and even restaurants that don't usually offer baked goods are trying to get a nibble of the market.Despite its name, the cookie's texture more closely resembles a rice cake, and is made by stuffing pistachio cream and knafeh shreds into a chocolate marshmallow.Shops are selling hundreds of cookies within minutes and the frenzy has sent prices of key ingredients surging, local media reported.This South Korean twist on the viral Dubai dessert first took off last September, after Jang Won-young from the girl band Ive posted a photograph of the chewy cookie on Instagram.While they currently sell for between 5,000 ($3; £2.5) and 10,000 won, prices are expected to climb due to strong demand. And apart from dessert shops and bakeries, other restaurants - from sushi bars to cold-noodle shops - are now offering the dessert. Local convenience store chain CU launched its Dubai chewy rice cake in October, and has sold some 1.8 million pieces of it in the last few months. \"Our manufacturing plant's production capacity cannot keep up with demand,\" a company representative told Yonhap News.So obsessed are the South Koreans with the cookie that someone even created a map that tracks shops selling the dessert, as well as their stock levels, in real time. Some stores have started imposing limits on how many cookies each customer can buy. The trend has also sparked online chatter among gig workers on whether hardware stores and cleaning companies should also start cashing in on Dubai chewy cookies, The Korea Herald reported.Such demand has driven up the price of pistachios, with local media reporting that a major supermarket chain has raised prices by 20% this year.Counterfeits have also emerged, spurring some consumers to call them out in their online reviews. \"I bought two for 11,000 Korean won, but there's no knafeh, and the exterior isn't marshmallow. It's heartbreaking,\" wrote one, in a review quoted by The Chosun Daily.Several food critics say the Dubai chewy cookies have taken off in South Korea because of how thick and dense they are.\"It reflects Korean food culture, where visual overwhelmingness matters more than balance or harmony of ingredients and flavours,\" food critic Lee Yong-jae told The Chosun Daily.

    "body": "The Trump administration is placing an indefinite pause on immigrant visa processing from 75 countries, further restricting the legal routes for entering the US.The State Department on Wednesday said the administration wants to bring \"an end to the abuse\" of the system \"by those who would extract wealth from the American people\" by using welfare and public benefits.President Donald Trump has sought to limit both illegal and legal crossing into the US since returning to office, and his administration has already halted immigrant visa processing for people from Brazil, Iran, Russia and Somalia.The order takes effect on 21 January, but a full list of the 75 countries has not yet been released.\"The State Department will use its long-standing authority to deem ineligible potential immigrants who would become a public charge on the United States and exploit the generosity of the American people,\" said Tommy Pigott, Principal Deputy spokesperson for the US State Department.The department, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, will pause the visa processing while it reassesses its procedures \"to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits\", Piggott added.According to the Associated Press, the State Department has instructed consular officers to halt immigrant visa applications from the affected countries. But the suspension will not apply to non-immigrant, temporary tourist, or business visas.In recent months, the State Department has increased restrictions on migration from countries Trump has deemed a threat to national security, including Russia, Iran and Afghanistan and several countries in Africa.After an immigrant from Afghanistan was charged in the November in the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, the administration banned or limited the entry of nationals of 19 countries. In December, it expanded the travel ban to people from five additional countries and those travelling on Palestinian Authority-issued documents.Asylum cases, citizenship processing and green card applications for immigrants from the initial 19 countries in the ban have also been paused.",

    "body": "18 hours agoKoh EweandJake Kwon,Seoul correspondentA surreal drum duet between two East Asian world leaders has set the internet abuzz - and put a spotlight on Japan and South Korea's diplomatic relationship.Decked out in matching blue jackets, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Tuesday played drums to the beats of K-pop hits - including Dynamite by BTS and Golden from hit film KPop Demon Hunters.The performance, a nod to Takaichi's past life as a drummer in a heavy metal band, wrapped up Lee's official visit to Japan this week.It's also part of Lee's diplomatic overtures to regional powers including Japan, with whom South Korea has a fraught history but shares a security alliance.The drumming session from Tuesday, which Lee described as \"a little clumsy\", has now spawned a viral video.During Lee's visit to Nara, Takaichi's hometown, he gifted the Japanese prime minister a drum set. The two leaders also exchanged signed drumsticks after their performance.\"When we met at APEC last year, [Lee] said it was his dream to play the drums, so we prepared a surprise,\" Takaichi later wrote on X.Footage of the jam session has won praise on social media.\"Music seems to have the power to connect hearts at a deeper level than words ever could,\" one X user wrote in Korean. \"Exchanges like this may be quiet, but they will surely help move relations between Korea and Japan forward.\"There have long been sore spots between the two neighbours, including historical grievances from Japan's colonial rule and territorial disputes.But both countries are allies of the US, and have worked together to counter China's increasing assertiveness in the region.On Tuesday, Takaichi said in a statement that cooperation between Japan, South Korea and the US has become increasingly important amid heightened tensions in the region's \"strategic environment\".Lee and Takaichi have also agreed to boost economic cooperation - a pledge that comes as China has been tightening its export of rare earths and dual-use goods to Japan.\"Just seeing them actually playing drums together - not just posing - looks like they are having so much fun, and that's what matters most,\" an X user wrote in Japanese. \"Both Korea and Japan are facing tough situations, but if we can meet each other halfway, I truly believe things will move in a positive direction.\"Lee's smoothness as a diplomat has boosted his approval ratings back home.Days before his viral jam session with Takaichi, he met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, with whom he took selfies on a Chinese smartphone.Last October, he flattered US President Donald Trump with a large golden crown. The only leader he hasn't been able to charm is North Korea's Kim Jong Un. Pyongyang has rejected Lee's overtures for peace and shown little interest in reconciliation. This week, Pyongyang demanded an apology from Seoul after accusing it of flying surveillance drones in its territory.Lee's rise to become president of South Korea had previously sounded alarm bells in Tokyo and Washington. Relatively unknown outside his own country at the time, Lee had a reputation as a firebrand who was sympathetic to socialist economic causes. The US feared South Korea would tilt towards China, South Korea's largest trading partner.Japan, meanwhile, feared a repeat of a spat in 2019, when South Korea threatened to pull out of an intelligence-sharing agreement after Japan tightened its exports to the country.That fight broke out after a South Korean court ordered Japanese companies to compensate the survivors of Japan's wartime forced labour, an issue Japan now considers resolved.Since taking office, however, Lee has walked a diplomatic tightrope among the region's major powers, from the US to China and now Japan.Lee heaped praise on Takaichi's drumming skills in a post on X, and likened their diplomatic efforts to the musical duet.\"Even if our timing was slightly different, our intention to find the same rhythm was shared,\" he wrote. \"In that same spirit, we will continue to build a future-oriented Korea–Japan relationship together, with one heart.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoRegan MorrisandChristal Hayes,Los AngelesSport fans can now sign up for a chance to attend the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games - with tickets starting at $28 (£21).Registration has opened for fans to enter a random ticket draw covering all events that will take place at the Games. The window will remain open until mid-March. If chosen, fans will be notified via email and will be given a time slot to purchase tickets in April. One million of those tickets will sell for $28, and about one-third are set to cost less than $100 (£74.41).\"These Games belong to everyone,\" Casey Wasserman, the chairman of LA 2028 said on Tuesday. \"These Games have to be affordable and inclusive.\"The announcement of affordable ticket prices come after the price of tickets for the 2026 men's football World Cup - which will also be hosted in the US, as well as Canada and Mexico - received some public criticism. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, LA officials said affordability and accessibility were central to their ticketing plan - and their hope that sport fans around the globe would be able to attend. Tickets for the 2024 Olympics in Paris started at $27.95 (£21).A special early purchase window will also be open for residents in the Los Angeles area and Oklahoma City, where some Olympic Games are also being held.2028 will be the first time the Olympics will be held in the US since the 1996 Games in Atlanta. Los Angeles has twice hosted the Olympics - in 1932 and 1984 - and plans to use its already established infrastructure to host the Games. Event organisers, along with hundreds of Olympians and Paralympians, gathered at the LA Memorial Coliseum on Tuesday for a ceremonial lighting of the Olympic venue's cauldron ahead of the opening of ticket registration. The Coliseum hosted events on both the previous occasions that the Olympics were held in LA, and it is set to co-host the opening ceremony along with track and field events in 2028. Organisers at the event on Tuesday explained how the ticketing would work. Once registered - using their name, email and zip code - fans will be entered into the random draw for time slots to buy tickets in April. The earlier slot a fan is given, the better their chances at securing tickets - as being given a time slot does not guarantee that there will be tickets available once a time slot is open.The first set of tickets will be up for purchase from 9-19 April. Admission for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games will be among the tickets on offer.Most of the Games will be held across Los Angeles and southern California, but both canoeing and softball will be held in Oklahoma. LA28 chief Allison Katz-Mayfield called the random ticket-drawing process \"the fairest way to ensure that the broadest number of people can get access to tickets and that no one is advantaged or disadvantaged\". \"No matter when you go in, whether you're the first person in or the last person in, you have the same opportunity,\" she added.Registration for tickets will be open until 18 March, and there is no advantage to registering early.",

Without giving details, the committee said the chief physician and the head of the intensive care unit had been detained for the \"improper performance of their official and professional duties in organising and providing medical care\".It said the suspects were co-operating with the investigation and authorities were deciding on charges as well as pre-trial detention.The committee released a video showing one man being escorted away and a man signing some papers in the presence of a uniformed officer. Victims and witnesses had been questioned and materials seized as work continued to gather more evidence, it added.Nine post-mortem examinations were being carried out.The Interfax news agency said the Kemerovo Region Ministry of Health which was also investigating said the infants had had a severe intra-uterine infection. The hospital has announced that it is no longer accepting patients due to a higher-than-usual rate of respiratory infections.",

    "body": "32 minutes agoTinshui YeungTSGT Scott Reed, USAFAl-Udeid is the largest US military base in the Middle EastThe US and UK are reducing the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar, as US President Donald Trump considers whether to take action against Iran over its crackdown on anti-government protests. Officials have told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that the partial American withdrawal was a \"precautionary measure\". The BBC understands some UK military personnel are also being removed. A Qatari government statement said the measures reportedly being taken by the US were \"in response to the current regional tensions\".The Foreign Office has also temporarily closed the British embassy in Tehran, which will now operate remotely, a government spokesperson said.The US embassy in Doha has advised its personnel to exercise increased caution and limit non-essential travel to the Al-Udeid air base.According to rights groups, more than 2,400 anti-government demonstrators have been killed in the recent violent crackdown by the Iranian authorities.Regarding the removal of military personnel, the Qatari government said it would continue to \"implement all necessary measures to safeguard the security and safety of its citizens and residents as a top priority, including actions related to the protection of critical infrastructure and military facilities\".A UK Ministry of Defence spokesperson declined to comment on reports that UK personnel were being withdrawn \"due to operational security\".Al-Udeid is the largest US military base in the Middle East and about 10,000 personnel are based there, as well as about 100 UK staff. It is not clear how many will be leaving.Earlier this week, Trump warned the US would take \"very strong action\" against Iran if the authorities execute protesters. Iran has said it will retaliate if attacked by the US.On Wednesday, he said his administration had been told \"on good authority\" that \"the killing in Iran is stopping, and there's no plan for executions\". When questioned by a reporter, Trump said that these were \"very important sources on the other side\" and that he hoped the reports were true. The US president was also asked whether military action was now off the table, to which he replied: \"We're going to watch and see what the process is.\"The Reuters news agency, citing diplomats, reported that while some personnel had been told to leave the Al-Udeid air base, there was no immediate sign of large numbers of troops being bussed out like in the hours before an Iranian strike last year.Speaking to Fox News on Wednesday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned Donald Trump to \"not repeat the same mistake that you did in June,\" adding: \"You know, if you try a failed experience, you will get the same result.\"As well as the temporary closure of the British embassy in Tehran, the US Mission to Saudi Arabia has advised its personnel and citizens to \"exercise increased caution and limit non-essential travel to any military installations in the region\".Italy and Poland have published statements urging their citizens to leave Iran, while Germany has issued a notice to air operators recommending that flights do not enter Tehran, citing potential risk from \"escalating conflict and anti-aviation weaponry\".Iran's government has accused the US of seeking to \"manufacture a pretext for military intervention\", with the parliament speaker warning that if the US attacked, both Israeli and US military and shipping centres in the region would become legitimate targets.The latest protests in Iran began at the end of December following the collapse of the currency and as the country deals with soaring living costs. They quickly widened into demands for political change and became one of the most serious challenges to the clerical establishment since the 1979 Islamic revolution.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it had so far confirmed the killing of 2,403 protesters, as well as 12 children, despite an internet blackout. More than 18,434 protesters have been arrested during the unrest, the group also reported.Amnesty International said there were \"mass unlawful killings committed on an unprecedented scale\", citing \"verified videos and credible information from eyewitnesses in Iran\".The organisation urged UN member states to recognise the \"crimes committed by security forces\" in the protests.",

    "body": "Denmark warns of 'fundamental disagreement' after White House talks on Greenland2 hours agoDaniel Bush Washington correspondent, at the White HouseWatch: \"Fundamental disagreement\" with US over Greenland remains, says Danish foreign ministerDenmark's foreign minister has said there is a \"fundamental disagreement\" with the US over Greenland after talks at the White House.Lars Lokke Rasmussen said the meeting with Vice-President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday had been \"frank but constructive\". But he added that US President Trump was insisting on \"conquering\" Greenland which was \"totally unacceptable\". \"We made it very, very clear that this is not in the interest of [Denmark],\" he said.Trump afterwards reiterated his interest in acquiring the resource-rich island, a position that has rattled allies across Europe and stoked tensions with Nato.The hour-long meeting between the US, Denmark and Greenland failed to bring a major breakthrough, although all sides agreed to set-up a high-level working group to discuss the future of the autonomous Danish territory.Rasmussen said there were \"red lines\" the US could not cross, and the working group would meet in the coming weeks in an effort to find a compromise. He added that Denmark and Greenland were open to the possibility of the US opening more military bases on the island.\"It's productive to start discussions at a high level,\" he said.Rasmussen also said there was an \"element of truth\" in Trump's view that security should be bolstered to counter Russian and Chinese interests in the Arctic. But he said the president's comments about the presence of Russian and Chinese warships  around Greenland were \"not true\".Watch: What message do Greenlanders want to send to Trump?Despite being a sparsely populated territory, Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region.Trump has repeatedly said acquiring it is vital to US national security. The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland's north-western tip, a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two.Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.After the talks on Wednesday, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greenland Vivian Motzfeldt said the territory was open to greater co-operation with the US but also opposed a takeover.\"We have shown where our limits are,\" Motzfeldt said.Vance and Rubio did not immediately comment after the meeting. Trump, meanwhile, told reporters in the Oval Office: \"We need Greenland for national security.\"\"The problem is there's not a thing that Denmark can do about it if Russia or China wants to occupy Greenland, but there's everything we can do,\" he said, adding that he does not believe the US can rely on Denmark to defend the island.The talks came as allies in Europe moved quickly to show support for Greenland.Sweden on Wednesday pledged to send armed forces to the territory at Denmark's request. France's foreign minister said the country planned to open a consulate on the island next month.Germany said in a statement provided to the BBC that it would send a \"reconnaissance team\" to Greenland to \"explore the general conditions for possible military contributions to support Denmark in ensuring security in the region\".Denmark said its military expansion in Greenland will take place \"in close co-operation with allies\".\"Geopolitical tensions have spread to the arctic,\" it said in a statement.The White House talks were just the latest round of diplomatic discussions over Trump's growing interest in the territory.It is unclear whether the president is considering using military force to seize the island, and he once again declined to rule it out when asked on Wednesday.Other options reportedly under consideration include purchasing the territory - though neither Danes nor Greenlanders have said it is for sale.Since taking office, Vance has criticised Denmark's stewardship of Greenland. The vice president visited soon after taking office.Trump has argued control of the territory is critical for his planned missile defence system, Golden Dome.\"It is vital for the Golden Dome that we are building,\" Trump said in a social media post early on Wednesday. \"NATO should be leading the way for us to get it.\"Public opinion polls suggest a majority of Greenland residents oppose coming under US control.Most Americans oppose US control of Greenland as well. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released Wednesday indicated that just 17% of Americans support the US seizing Greenland, compared to 47 percent who said they opposed Trump's push to acquire the island.The latest talks on Greenland follow US military operations in Venezuela and against ISIS targets in Syria. Trump has also threatened to take military action to stop Iran's crackdown on a growing protest movement engulfing the nation.",

A one-year-old and an 85-year-old are among those injured, with seven people in critical condition, say authorities.Officials say some 171 passengers were on board the train when the accident occurred at around 09:00 local time (02:00 GMT). Thai state railways says it is taking legal action against the construction company responsible for the crane. The Italian-Thai Development Company expressed regret, saying it would compensate families of the dead and injured.The train had been travelling from Bangkok to north-eastern Ubon Ratchathani province when the accident occurred. It was carrying mostly students and workers travelling for school and work in other districts.Local outlet The Nation reported that the incident occurred while the crane was lifting a large concrete section which dropped on to the train, causing several coaches to derail.One survivor, train staff member Thirasak Wongsoongnern, told local media that he and the other passengers were thrown into the air after the crane fell on them.An eyewitness, Maliwan Nakthon, told BBC Thai that she witnessed the moment the crane collapsed. \"There were small pieces, like fragments of concrete, that started falling,\" she said. \"After those fell, the crane slowly slid down and hit. It struck hard, and then it came down and crushed the train.\"The whole incident took less than one minute,\" she added.'Grim scene': BBC on site after crane collapses on train in ThailandThai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, who is due to visit the scene later on Wednesday, called for \"someone [to] be punished and held accountable\" for the incident, which is being investigated.\"Accidents like this can only happen due to negligence, skipped steps, deviations from the design, or the use of incorrect materials,\" Anutin said.The crane was being used to build an overhead railway that is part of a US$5.4bn (£4bn) China-backed project to link Bangkok with neighbouring Laos, where a Chinese-built high-speed line is already running to south-western China.Known officially as the Bangkok-Nong Khai HSR Development for Regional Connectivity, the Italian-Thai Development Company is listed as the firm in charge of the Lam Takhong-Sikhio section where the incident took place.The State Railway of Thailand has announced that it is suing the company. The initial cost of damages for the train carriages alone is reported to be more than 100 million baht (US$3.1m).ReutersConstruction work had been going on when the train travelling past was hitOne of Thailand's biggest contractors, the company was responsible for the construction of a Bangkok skyscraper that collapsed last March during an earthquake. Last year the company's president and several designers and engineers were charged with professional negligence over that incident. Some have denied wrongdoing. The Chinese embassy in Thailand said that no Chinese construction companies or workers were involved in the collapse, Chinese state media reported.Thailand is no stranger to deadly construction accidents, due in part to weak enforcement of safety standards and regulations.In 2023, a freight train collided with a pick-up truck that was crossing railway tracks in the country's east, killing eight people and injuring four others.Around 150 people have been killed over the past seven years in numerous accidents on a road improvement project from Bangkok to the south of the country.ReutersA worker on the train described being thrown into the air at the moment of impactCorrection: This article was amended to reflect that 100 million baht is $3.1m.

    "body": "US launches phase two of Gaza peace plan with new technocratic government4 hours agoDavid GrittenandJon Donnison,JerusalemReutersPhase two of the peace plan should see reconstruction starting in Gaza after two years of warUS envoy Steve Witkoff has announced the start of phase two of President Donald Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza, with a technocratic Palestinian government established in the territory.Under phase one, Hamas and Israel agreed a ceasefire in October, as well as a hostage-prisoner exchange, a partial Israeli withdrawal, and an aid surge.Witkoff said phase two would also see the reconstruction and full demilitarisation of Gaza, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups.\"The US expects Hamas to comply fully with its obligations,\" he warned, noting these include the return of the body of the last dead Israeli hostage. \"Failure to do so will bring serious consequences.\"However, two key points of phase two could be problematic.Hamas has previously refused to give up its weapons without the creation of an independent Palestinian state, and Israel has not committed to fully withdrawing from Gaza.The ceasefire is also fragile at best, with both sides accusing each other of repeated violations. Almost 450 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since it came into force, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.And humanitarian conditions in the territory remain dire, according to the UN, which has stressed the need for the unrestricted flow of critical supplies.In his statement, Witkoff declared that with the launch of phase two of Trump's 20-point peace plan on Wednesday, Gaza was \"moving from ceasefire to demilitarisation, technocratic governance, and reconstruction\".\"Phase Two establishes a transitional technocratic Palestinian administration in Gaza, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), and begins the full demilitarization and reconstruction of Gaza, primarily the disarmament of all unauthorized personnel,\" he said.Following the announcement, regional mediators Egypt, Qatar and Turkey welcomed the formation of what they called the \"Palestinian Technocratic Committee to Administer the Gaza Strip\", saying it would contribute to \"efforts aimed at consolidating stability and improving the humanitarian situation\".They also revealed that the 15-member committee would be headed by Ali Shaath, a former deputy planning minister in the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under Israeli control.Gaza's transitional administration will operate under the supervision of a \"Board of Peace\", which will be chaired by Trump, according to the 20-point plan he unveiled three months ago.Announcements related to the board are expected in the coming days, including when the president visits the World Economic Forum in Davos next week.Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician and former UN Middle East envoy, is set to be the board's representative on the ground in Gaza.Trump's plan says an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) will also be deployed to Gaza to train and support vetted Palestinian police forces.Israel's prime minister told Ran Gvili's parents that his return was \"a top priority\"Earlier on Wednesday, Hamas and its ally Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) said in a joint statement that they had agreed to support the efforts to form the technocratic Palestinian government \"while providing the appropriate environment\" for it to begin work.The PA - which is dominated by Fatah, Hamas's rival - also expressed support.Vice-President Hussein al-Sheikh said Trump's leadership urged all Palestinian factions, institutions and segments of society to \"ensure the success of this critical transitional phase\". He also stressed the importance of linking institutions in the West Bank and Gaza in order to uphold \"the principle of one system, one law, and one legitimate weapon\".According to Trump's plan, the PA will take over governing Gaza once it has completed reforms and can do so \"securely and effectively\".Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said he had spoken on Wednesday evening with the parents of Ran Gvili, the last dead hostage in Gaza.He made it clear to Itzik and Talik Gvili that \"Ran's return is a top priority and that the declaratory move regarding the establishment of a technocratic committee will not affect the efforts to return Ran for a Jewish burial\", the office added.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum insisted: \"There is no phase 2 while Ran Gvili in Gaza. Phase Rani must come first.\"The Israeli government had accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the 24-year-old police officer's remains and said it will not reopen the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt – one of its obligations under phase one - until they are handed over.Gvili was among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,430 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.",

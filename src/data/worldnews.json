It was, he said, deliberate and the activity had increased since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Britain has half a dozen dedicated military satellites in orbit providing communications and surveillance. </p><p>In contrast, the US, China and Russia each have more than a hundred. The combined Russian and Chinese fleet of satellites has increased by 70% over the past decade. </p><p>Gen Tedman said Russia and China had both tested anti-satellite weapons. Both the UK and the US have warned that Russia has been developing the capability to put nuclear weapons in space. </p><p>While the US sees China as the pacing threat, Gen Tedman sees Russia as the more immediate danger: \"I would say the Chinese have by far the more sophisticated capability but the Russians have more will to use their counter-space systems.\"</p><p>Gen Tedman said he was \"really worried\" about what was happening in space – not just the threats but the increasing congestion. There are currently about 45,000 objects in orbit including around 9,000 satellites. This year will see another 300 rocket launches into space.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f2da/live/fca4cfe0-9fb2-11f0-8410-854cfa733f11.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f2da/live/fca4cfe0-9fb2-11f0-8410-854cfa733f11.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f2da/live/fca4cfe0-9fb2-11f0-8410-854cfa733f11.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f2da/live/fca4cfe0-9fb2-11f0-8410-854cfa733f11.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f2da/live/fca4cfe0-9fb2-11f0-8410-854cfa733f11.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f2da/live/fca4cfe0-9fb2-11f0-8410-854cfa733f11.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f2da/live/fca4cfe0-9fb2-11f0-8410-854cfa733f11.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f2da/live/fca4cfe0-9fb2-11f0-8410-854cfa733f11.jpg.webp\" alt=\"UK MoD A man wearing protective gear fixes the Tyche satellite in a laboratory.\n\" /><span>UK MoD</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Tyche is the MoD's first wholly owned Earth observation satellite. </figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>The general was speaking on a visit to RAF Fylingdales in North Yorkshire. It is home to Britain and America's Ballistic Missile Early Warning System. It is a job they has been doing since 1963.</p><p>The three famous large radomes or \"golf balls\" from the Cold War era have been replaced by a 30-metre (98-ft) pyramid which houses thousands of antennas.</p><p>It looks like a spaceship has landed on the North Yorkshire moors, surrounded by sheep, an electrified perimeter fence and razor wire. </p><p>The unblinking eye provides 360 degree coverage from the Arctic to North Africa, and from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Its radar can track objects the size of a tin can, 3,000 miles (4,800km) into space.</p><p>Inside, the heavy blast doors and air locks tell you that his too could be a target for any adversary. In the operations room, UK military personnel watch round the clock, every day of the year. </p><p>The RAF's 2 Space Warning Squadron take us through the drill of how they detect a missile launch. They are plugged into other US satellites and sensors that enable them to detect a launch anywhere in the world. </p><p>Gen Tedman calls space \"a team sport\" but, in reality, the UK is heavily reliant on America. US contractors maintain the radar at Fylingdales. </p><p>The UK officer in charge of the watch says along with other sources \"we'd know the UK was under threat probably within a minute\".</p><p>What is mentioned less is the UK's ability to intercept ballistic missiles. Currently the UK has very little in the way of ballistic missile defence.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/abdc/live/18086fc0-9fd2-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/abdc/live/18086fc0-9fd2-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/abdc/live/18086fc0-9fd2-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/abdc/live/18086fc0-9fd2-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/abdc/live/18086fc0-9fd2-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/abdc/live/18086fc0-9fd2-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/abdc/live/18086fc0-9fd2-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/abdc/live/18086fc0-9fd2-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.png.webp\" alt=\"The exterior of the air force base.

It is also taking steps to defend its satellites. This week it is announcing it will test sensors to detect laser threats in space.</p><p>Both China and Russia have developed lasers which could be used to dazzle and disrupt an adversary's satellites. </p><p>Gen Tedman said: \"We've committed to invest a billion pounds into integrated air and missile defence, and I'd be surprised if there's not a space aspect to how we're going to defend the UK from threats very similar to [America's] Golden Dome.\"</p><p>He was referring to President Donald Trump's plan to build a shield around the US against any missile attacks. </p><p>However, the UK is in danger of being left behind in the space race. Currently it spends about 1% of its defence budget on space. In contrast, France spends about 3% and the US 5%.</p><p>Gen Tedman would like to see space given a higher priority. He says around £450bn  of the UK economy is dependent on space. It is also the nervous system on which the UK's armed forces increasingly depend – from navigation to precision strikes.</p><p>Before we leave RAF Fylingdales, there is another reminder why space is so important. </p><p>We are warned we will have to leave the operations room if there is a real-life incident. While we are filming another alert comes through of a ballistic missile launch and we are swiftly escorted to the exit. </p><p>They are observing short-range ballistic missile launches almost every day. In this incident they will not say from where but it is no secret Russia has been firing them regularly into Ukraine. </p><p>In 2024 more than 4,000 missiles were fired around the globe. Russia was the reason why Flyingdales was first created in the Cold War era. The threat has not gone away.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

They have been rallying mainly through social media, and do not have a formal leadership structure. </p><p>Official statistics show that Morocco's unemployment rate stands at 12.8%, with youth unemployment soaring to 35.8% and 19% among graduates, news agency Reuters reports. </p><p>Protests have also hit the capital, Rabat, the main commercial city, Casablanca, and the port city of Tangier - the arrival point for tourists going to Morocco by ferry from Spain. </p><p>Morocco's tourist hub, Marrakesh, was also hit by violence, with protesters burning a police station, according to local media.</p><p>Interior ministry spokesman Rachid El Khalfi said that 409 people have been  detained across Morocco following the unrest. </p><p>More than 260 police officers and 20 protesters have been injured, while 40 police vehicles and 20 private cars have been torched, he was quoted as saying.</p><p>The uprising follows similar youth-led, large scale demonstrations this summer in Nepal, Indonesia, the Philippines and Madagascar.</p><p>The uprising in Nepal led to the prime minister resigning, while Madagascar's president dissolved his government on Monday in an attempt to placate the protesters there.</p><p>Morocco's governing coalition issued a statement on Tuesday expressing willingness to engage in dialogue with the youth \"within institutions and public spaces to find realistic solutions\".</p><p>It also praised what it called \"the balanced reaction of security authorities in line with relevant legal procedures\".</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><p>The director of the Dwight D Eisenhower Presidential Library has stepped down after a dispute with the Trump administration over gifting a sword in its collection to King Charles, according to the BBC's US partner, CBS News. </p><p>Todd Arrington, the head of the library in Kansas, resigned on Monday after declining to remove an original sword from the library's collection to give to the King during President Donald Trump's visit to the United Kingdom last month, CBS reported, citing anonymous sources. </p><p>Charles was instead gifted a replica during Trump's UK visit, Buckingham Palace said at the time. </p><p>In an interview with CBS News, Arrington said he was told to \"Resign - or be fired\". </p></div><div><p>\"Apparently, they believed I could no longer be trusted with confidential information,\" Arrington told the outlet, saying the confidential information was related to the sword dispute and an unrelated matter.  </p><p>The BBC has contacted the White House, the National Archives and Eisenhower library for comment. </p><p>US State Department officials were seeking to gift an Eisenhower sword to emphasize the importance of the US-UK relationship after World War II, but Arrington declined and said they couldn't hand over an artifact that was accepted as a donation, sources told CBS News. </p><p>The outlet said it was not clear who in particular requested the sword to present to the king. </p><p>Arrington reportedly offered to try to find a different gift, including a replica, but State Department officials continued to request the original sword. </p><p>Ultimately, the president and First Lady Melania Trump gave the King a replica of one of Eisenhower's swords at Windsor Castle in September. They also gave the Queen a Tiffany & Co vintage 18-carat gold, diamond and ruby flower brooch.</p><p>The situation led to Trump administration officials being unhappy with Arrington, CBS News reported. </p><p>Arrington disputed that he had made negative remarks about Trump and his administration. </p><p>\"That is 100% incorrect,\" he told CBS News. \"I never said a bad word about anybody. I talked to colleagues about trying to find a sword or artifact, something we could give to them for the president to give to the King, and at no time did I disparage anyone.\"</p><p>The Eisenhower library has several swords from the president in its collection, including a saber and a sword of honour featured in a current exhibit. Eisenhower, who was the 34th president from 1953 to 1961, served as the supreme commander of the allied forces in Europe during World War II. </p><p>Arrington had been working as director of the Eisenhower library since August 2024. It is one of 16 presidential libraries in the US that are run by the National Archives. </p><p>The US archivist is responsible for hiring library directors, and the White House does not have a say in the firing and hiring of these employees. </p><p>Arrington told CBS that he wanted to go back to his job. </p><p>\"I'd return to this job in a heartbeat,\" he said. \"I love the job, I love the people, I love the history. I never in a million years wanted this to happen.\"</p></div>"

Help came from China, the European Union and Venezuela, among others.</p><p>In 2017, the UNDP stumped up $25m for Barbuda and the island country of Dominica, which was ravaged by Hurricane Maria that same month.</p><p>The money restored more than 800 wrecked buildings across the two islands. But the body's intervention was crucial in other ways too.</p><p>With livelihoods destroyed, the UNDP's cash-for-work programme hired hundreds of local residents who had suddenly found themselves unemployed.</p><p>They assisted with everything from debris removal to reconstruction of homes and infrastructure, including Barbuda's hospital and post office, the UNDP's Luis Gamarra tells the BBC.</p><p>\"Injecting economic resources into affected families helps reactivate the local economy,\" he says.</p><p>Almost 1,000 contractors were also trained in more resilient \"build back better\" techniques, to safeguard structures against future disasters.</p><p>\"The climate is changing and putting more pressure on governments and communities. Storms are becoming more frequent, more intense and happening earlier in the year too,\" Mr Gamarra continues.</p></div><div><p>He thinks the expansion of partnerships with the private sector and with other countries in the region might help mitigate the impacts.</p><p>One such mechanism is the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility, of which 19 Caribbean governments are members. Set up after Hurricane Ivan in 2004, the first-of-its-kind risk-pooling venture allows member governments to buy disaster coverage at low cost.</p><p>Last year it made record payments topping $85m to Hurricane Beryl-hit islands.</p><p>In Antigua and Barbuda, hurricane preparedness is a year-round endeavour, explains Sherrod James, director of the country's office of disaster services.</p><p>Assessments of buildings to be used as storm shelters, along with training of volunteers to man them, starts months before the season starts, he says.</p><p>\"We also meet with the private sector, helping them put policies and preparations in place, looking at the safety and resilience of their buildings. We make sure our critical partners, such as the ports, are prepared.</p><p>\"And we do a lot of proactive work to address chokepoints within waterways that can exacerbate flooding,\" adds Mr James. \"These days, storms can go from a category one to five in a day. The new norm has thrown out the old regiment of what has to be done; we have to be much more proactive now.\"</p><p>For many Barbudans, this time of year will always bring trepidation. Dwight was among dozens who recently attended a Hurricane Irma remembrance service at the island's Pentecostal Church.</p><p>\"It was very touching and brought back a lot of memories,\" he says. \"This time of year, we keep an eye on the weather and our fingers crossed. But we are resilient people and we know how to survive.\"</p></div></article>"

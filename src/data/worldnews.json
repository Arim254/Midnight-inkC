    "body": "<div><p>Convicted rap mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has written a letter to the judge overseeing his criminal trial, asking for leniency during his sentencing on Friday and blaming his past behaviour on drug addiction.</p><p>In the four-page letter, he apologises \"for all of the hurt and pain that I have caused\" and says that he has been reformed after spending 13 months in a Brooklyn jail. </p><p>The letter on Thursday comes hours ahead of his sentencing hearing at 10:00 ET (15:00GMT) on Friday.</p><p>In July, he was found guilty of two prostitution charges and now faces up to 20 years in prison. Prosecutors are seeking a sentence of at least 11 years, but Combs' lawyers are asking that he be released later this month.</p></div><div><p>In his letter to Judge Arun Subramanian, Combs apologises for assaulting his ex-girlfriend, singer Casandra Ventura, writing: \"I literally lost my mind\". </p><p>\"I'm sorry for that and always will be,\" he continues. \"My domestic violence will always be heavy burden that will have to forever carry.\"</p><p>He also apologies to an anonymous woman who testified during the trial under the name \"Jane\" and says he became \"lost in the drugs and the excess\". </p><p>\"I lost my way,\" he wrote. \"My downfall was rooted in my selfishness. I have been humbled and broken to my core.\"</p></div><div><p>Comb's accusers have also written to the judge, describing how he wielded his power and influence to ruin their lives, and their fears that he would seek revenge if freed. </p><p>\"I am so scared that if he walks free, his first actions will be swift retribution towards me and others who spoke up,\" wrote Ms Ventura.</p><p>She added that she believes he deserves a long sentence, writing: \"He has no interest in changing or becoming better. He will always be the same cruel, power-hungry, manipulative man that he is.\" </p><p>In his letter, Combs describes teaching a class to fellow inmates on \"what I did to become a successful business man\", describing himself as a changed person who is now sober for the first time in 25 years. </p><p>\"The old me died in jail and new version of me was reborn,\" he writes. </p><p>Comb goes on to ask the judge for mercy, \"not only for my sake, but for the sake of my children\". He asked the judge to consider his seven kids, and his 84-year-old mother who recently had brain surgery. </p><p>He notes that the judge might be tempted to make an example out of him and instead asks that he be made an example of \"what a person can do if afforded a second chance\". </p><p>Combs is also expected to speak in court on Friday before the judge issues his sentence. Four of his lawyers are also slated to speak, and his defence team also plans to show a 15-minute video. It's unclear what the video may include.</p><p>In July, a jury acquitted him of the most severe charges: racketeering and sex trafficking - which could have resulted in him spending the rest of his life behind bars. He was found guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.</p><p>Prosecutors say he is \"unrepentant\" and argued the rapper should spend a minimum of 11 years in prison. </p><p>\"The defendant tries to recast decades of abuse as simply the function of mutually toxic relationships,\" prosecutors wrote in a 29 September filing. \"But there is nothing mutual about a relationship where one person holds all the power and the other ends up bloodied and bruised.\"</p></div>",

They have been rallying mainly through social media, and do not have a formal leadership structure. </p><p>Official statistics show that Morocco's unemployment rate stands at 12.8%, with youth unemployment soaring to 35.8% and 19% among graduates, news agency Reuters reports. </p><p>Protests have also hit the capital, Rabat, the main commercial city, Casablanca, and the port city of Tangier - the arrival point for tourists going to Morocco by ferry from Spain. </p><p>Morocco's tourist hub, Marrakesh, was also hit by violence, with protesters burning a police station, according to local media.</p><p>Interior ministry spokesman Rachid El Khalfi said that 409 people have been  detained across Morocco following the unrest. </p><p>More than 260 police officers and 20 protesters have been injured, while 40 police vehicles and 20 private cars have been torched, he was quoted as saying.</p><p>The uprising follows similar youth-led, large scale demonstrations this summer in Nepal, Indonesia, the Philippines and Madagascar.</p><p>The uprising in Nepal led to the prime minister resigning, while Madagascar's president dissolved his government on Monday in an attempt to placate the protesters there.</p><p>Morocco's governing coalition issued a statement on Tuesday expressing willingness to engage in dialogue with the youth \"within institutions and public spaces to find realistic solutions\".</p><p>It also praised what it called \"the balanced reaction of security authorities in line with relevant legal procedures\".</p></div>",

People with listeriosis can develop sepsis - a life-threatening overreaction by the immune system.</p></div><div><p>The regional authority confirmed that infection tracing, initially covering guests who ate at the restaurant between 25 and 27 September, had since been widened to include people who dined there from 23 and 24 September.</p><p>\"Those with ongoing symptoms such as fever, vomiting or diarrhoea are now recommended to visit a hospital emergency room for assessment,\" Maria Rotzén Östlund, an infectious disease physician, told state broadcaster SVT.</p><p>Regional health officials warned in a press release that \"a large number of people may have been infected\" and emphasised that listeria posed the greatest risk to pregnant women, older people and those with weakened immune systems.</p><p>As of Thursday evening, 85 people have complained of having food poisoning after dining at the restaurant with a city tracking tool, officials said. Around 400 people have been contacted for infection tracing.</p><p>Four people had sepsis but none had needed intensive care, the broadcaster quoted infectious disease specialist Maria Rotzén Östlund as saying.</p><p>Coco & Carmen has temporarily closed while an investigation into the cause of the suspected outbreak continues. </p><p>The restaurant said in a statement that it had always passed food safety inspections and was co-operating with the authorities.</p><p>\"We take this extremely seriously and as the well-being of our guests is our top priority, we have voluntarily closed until further notice,\" the owners said, adding that they hoped to reopen on 7 October.</p><p>Joakim Almquist, the chef and co-owner, told SVT: \"The only thing I can do is sincerely apologise, because I suffer with these people.\"</p><p>Listeria is commonly found in soil, water and animals, and can spread through contaminated food, particularly when stored in cold conditions for long periods. </p><p>While most people experience only mild symptoms resembling stomach flu, it can lead to severe illness such as meningitis or sepsis. The incubation period can stretch from several days to three weeks.</p><p><i>Additional reporting by Kathryn Armstrong</i></p></div>",

More than 830,000 of these were British. </p><p>Local laws state that shop windows \"must not show products that might hurt people's moral sensitivity\" and it gives as an example \"sexy articles\". The regulation does not affect items sold in the interior of shops.</p><p>Benidorm's conservative local authorities are beginning the clampdown by reminding shop owners of the regulation and asking them to remove from their windows or entrances any items which might be deemed to violate it. </p><p>If they do not, the next step is to take sanctions, which can include fines of up to €3,000 (£2,614). </p><p>But Mr Jordá said he hoped that such measures would not be necessary.</p><p>\"We don't want it to come to that, but we must guarantee respect for the rule and that the right image is given of the city,\" he said.</p><p>Spain received 94 million foreign visitors last year - a new record - with the United Kingdom, France and Germany providing the largest numbers. </p><p>The most popular destinations are resorts along the Mediterranean coast, like Benidorm, or in the Canary and Balearic Islands. </p><p>However, Spain's tourism industry has more recently attempt to move away from the sun-and-sand model for which the country is famous due to concerns about over-tourism, which have led to protests.</p></div>",

Israel has been policing this area but does not have jurisdiction there.</p><p>Israel said its navy told the boats to change course as they were \"approaching an active combat zone and violating a lawful naval blockade\", while the GSF described the interceptions as \"illegal\".</p></div><div><p>The group said Israel's response was \"not an act of defence\", but \"a brazen act of desperation\".</p><p>It estimated 443 people were detained from the boats and alleged that many were assaulted with water cannon. Israel said all those detained were \"safe and in good health\".</p><p>A growing number of countries have expressed concern over the incident, criticising Israel for staging the interception in international waters.</p><p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has expelled all remaining Israeli diplomats from the country in response, and denounced the interception as an \"international crime by [Israel's Prime Minister] Netanyahu\". </p><p>Petro also terminated Colombia's free trade agreement with Israel, in place since 2020, and called for the release of two Colombians who were aboard the flotilla.</p><p>Amnesty International's Secretary General, Agnès Callamard, said Israel's blockade on Gaza was \"unlawful\" and that the \"decades-long impunity for Israel's blatant violations of international law must end\".</p><p>However, Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni criticised the attempt to reach Gaza, saying: \"I continue to believe that all this brings no benefit to the Palestinian people.\"</p><p>Israel's Foreign Ministry posted footage from the interception showing Thunberg sitting on the deck of a boat, being handed water and a jacket by a member of the Israeli military. Detained activists are being taken to the port of Ashdod, Israel said.</p><p>\"Greta and her friends are safe and healthy,\" the Israeli government said.</p><p>Israel has described the flotilla as \"provocation yachts\" and contends that it was justified in stopping the vessels before they entered the naval blockade of the waters that border Gaza.</p><p>It said one boat remained \"at a distance\" and would be intercepted if it approached the blockade.</p><p>That boat appeared to be the Marinette, which the GSF said was still in communication and carrying six people on board. The flotilla's tracking system showed it sailing in international waters a long distance from Gaza's coastline on Thursday afternoon.</p><p>Israel said none of the boats entered the blockade area, though the GSF tracking suggests one of its boats, the Mikeno, may have entered Gaza's territorial waters, but remains out of contact.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9cfe/live/e7cd10e0-9f0e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9cfe/live/e7cd10e0-9f0e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9cfe/live/e7cd10e0-9f0e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9cfe/live/e7cd10e0-9f0e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9cfe/live/e7cd10e0-9f0e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9cfe/live/e7cd10e0-9f0e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9cfe/live/e7cd10e0-9f0e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9cfe/live/e7cd10e0-9f0e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp\" alt=\"Israeli foreign ministry Greta Thunberg is detained by the Israeli navy after it intercepted a flotilla heading to Gaza\" /><span>Israeli foreign ministry</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>The Israeli foreign ministry released footage of its forces detaining Swedish activist Greta Thunberg from one of the boats</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>A member of the legal team working with the GSF said there will be a further attempt to breach Israel's blockade \"in the coming days\".</p><p>Caoimhe Butterly, who is aboard a vessel providing legal support and acting as an observer to the GSF, said: \"There is the expectation that it will be up to 13 vessels, ships and boats and that it will follow a similar route to Gaza.\"</p><p>This will be organised by a separate group, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which launched two previous attempts that were both intercepted.</p><p>People have gathered in Greece, Italy, Germany, Tunisia and Turkey to protest against Israel's interception of the flotilla.

    "body": "<div><p>US federal workers have described their state of uncertainty, with many now on unpaid leave due to a government shutdown and one remarking that their salary was being \"held hostage\".</p><p>Workers deemed to be essential may still be on duty or at their desks, but they too may not be paid while the shutdown lasts.</p><p>A government shutdown is a familiar situation in the US, and can happen whenever Congress fails to vote through an annual budget. This one began on Wednesday, and this deadlock is characterised by partisan disputes over federal spending and Democratic demands to extend healthcare tax credits.</p><p>What makes this shutdown different is the fact that President Donald Trump hopes to use the opportunity to make permanent cuts to government staffing and spending.</p><p>BBC News has been speaking to federal workers about their views and how the shutdown has affected them.</p><p>Although most of the comments below are anonymous, we have verified that the speakers are federal workers. US government staff are generally forbidden from speaking to the media, and we have protected the speakers' identities because they could face disciplinary action if they are named.</p></div><div><p>\"The last shutdown was brutal\", said one federal worker, who highlighted that the impasse in 2018-19 lasted more than a month.</p><p>He added: \"It forced me to withdraw money from my retirement plan just to cover my bills. Now, they've made it more difficult to withdraw from our retirement accounts, so if this goes as long as the last shutdown, I don't know how I'm going to pay my bills.\"</p><p>The same worker said: \"I voted for Trump, but I did not vote for his abuses against us.\"</p><p>Another worker, for the Department of Homeland Security, based in New Jersey, took a slightly different view: \"Despite working without timely pay, I support the shutdown.\" </p><p>He explained: \"The president's circumvention of Congress' power of the purse has been left unchecked by the Supreme Court. Checks and balances must be maintained.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, a worker for Army Corps of Engineers said she was \"rather conflicted\" and did not mind a break from the \"gruelling end of fiscal year - a year full of constantly shifting guidance and the ever-present threat\" of a mass firing.</p><p>She said she would \"support a shutdown if anything productive comes of it, but I'm unsure anything will\".</p><p>Randall from Kansas City, who works with the Aviation Weather Center, said: \"I don't like my pay being held hostage while the government fights over separate issues.\"</p><p>He said he believed that keeping the National Weather Service funded was something both parties typically agreed, so asked why he was \"facing sudden loss of funds because Congress is fighting over healthcare or whatever\". He emphasised that these were his personal views, and not those of his agency.</p><p>An anonymous US Air Force employee told us that if the situation was not resolved, he would have nothing to live on. He expressed his dilemma as follows: \"I must still show up to work but won't get paid, because if I don't it's considered AWOL\".</p><p>A worker at the Department of the Treasury had a message to the party holding out against the spending plans of Trump's Republican party.</p><p>\"I strongly implore Democrats to stand firm and not cave to the continued assault on healthcare and affordability for everyday Americans,\" she said. She added that no amount of threats to her job would cause her to waver in her views.</p></div><p><i>Additional reporting by Kris Bramwell, Mary Litchfield, Alex Akhurst and Imogen James</i></p>",

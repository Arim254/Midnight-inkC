Ekkalak then fled to Cambodia, where he was arrested and deported.</p><p>Ekkalak had initially been handed the death penalty, but that was commuted to life imprisonment because of his confession to the killing, the court said on Friday.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdr0rx307p3o\">The reason behind Lim Kimya's killing remains unclear</a> - though it has been widely suspected to be a politically motivated assassination.</p></div><div><p>Opposition politicians and activists are often jailed and harassed in Cambodia, where authorities have little tolerance for political dissent.</p><p>Lim Kimya, who had dual Cambodian and French nationality, was a former parliamentarian from Cambodia's main opposition party, the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP).</p><p>The CNRP had come close to defeating the long-ruling party of former leader Hun Sen in 2013.</p><p>After Hun Sen accused the CNRP of treason, the party was banned in 2017 and its members were prohibited from taking part in political activities.</p><p>Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet - who succeeded his father Hun Sen in 2023 - has denied that the government was involved in Lim's killing.</p><p>Security camera footage from January showed Ekkalak parking his motorbike, removing his helmet and walking calmly across the road before shots rang out.</p><p>Ekkalak was also found guilty of carrying and using a firearm, and ordered to pay around $55,000 (Â£40,800) to Lim Kimya's family.</p><p>The court dismissed a charge against another defendant - a Thai national accused of driving Ekkalak to the Cambodian border after the shooting - on the grounds that he was only a driver who did not know about the killing.</p><p>The lawyer for Lim Kimya's widow told news agency AFP that she was \"probably satisfied\" with Friday's verdict, though she was \"still questioning who ordered the crime\".</p><p>\"She wants authorities to get to the bottom of it.\"</p><p>In recent years dozens of activists fleeing repression in Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand have been sent back after seeking sanctuary, or in some cases have been killed or disappeared. </p><p>Human rights groups believe there is an unwritten agreement among the four neighbouring countries to allow each other's security forces to pursue dissidents over the border.</p></div>",

I don't know how I will get through this. I love him so much. I want to wake up from this horrible nightmare.\"</p><p>Details of what caused the incident are not clear, but Miller's brother Dylan told AFP he was lead rope soloing - a technique that enables climbing alone while still protected by a rope - on a 2,400ft (730m) route named Sea of Dreams.</p></div><div><p>He had finished the climb and was hauling up equipment when he likely rappelled off the end of his rope, Dylan said.</p><p>Tom Evans, a Yosemite-based photographer who witnessed Miller fall, told <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.climbing.com/news/alpinist-balin-miller-dies-in-yosemite/\">Climbing magazine</a> he called 911 after Miller tried to free his bag, which was stuck on a rock.</p><p>Originally from Anchorage, Miller grew up climbing with his father and brother. </p><p>He was an accomplished alpinist and gained international attention for claiming the first solo ascent of Mount McKinley's Slovak Direct, which took him 56 hours to complete, according to a post on his Instagram in June. </p><p>\"He's had probably one of the most impressive last six months of climbing of anyone I can think of,\" veteran alpinist Clint Helander told the Anchorage Daily News in July. </p><p>Another renowned Alaskan climber Mark Westman, compared him to Alex Honnold, who became the first person to free solo a full route on El Capitan. </p><p>Miller's death came on the first day of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdr6pnky7vyo\">federal government shutdown</a>, which left national parks \"generally\" open, with limited operations and closed visitors centres. </p><p>The National Park Service said in a statement that they were investigating the incident and \"park rangers and emergency personnel responded immediately.\" </p><p>Miller had spent weeks solo climbing in Patagonia and the Canadian Rockies, completing a notoriously difficult ice climb called Reality Bath, which had been unrepeated for 37 years, according to Climbing magazine.</p><p>He was known affectionately as the \"Orange Tent Guy\", due to his distinctive campsite at the base of El Capitan. </p><p>El Capitan, an enormous sheer granite rock face of approximately 3,000 feet (915 meters), is a major landmark in the national park and entices big-wall rock climbers from all over the world.</p><p>Miller's death marks the third at the Californian national park this year. In June, an 18-year-old from Texas died in the park while climbing without a rope on a different formation.</p><p>And in August, a 29-year-old hiker died after being struck in the head by a large tree branch. </p></div>",

    "body": "<div><p>US federal workers have described their state of uncertainty, with many now on unpaid leave due to a government shutdown and one remarking that their salary was being \"held hostage\".</p><p>Workers deemed to be essential may still be on duty or at their desks, but they too may not be paid while the shutdown lasts.</p><p>A government shutdown is a familiar situation in the US, and can happen whenever Congress fails to vote through an annual budget. This one began on Wednesday, and this deadlock is characterised by partisan disputes over federal spending and Democratic demands to extend healthcare tax credits.</p><p>What makes this shutdown different is the fact that President Donald Trump hopes to use the opportunity to make permanent cuts to government staffing and spending.</p><p>BBC News has been speaking to federal workers about their views and how the shutdown has affected them.</p><p>Although most of the comments below are anonymous, we have verified that the speakers are federal workers. US government staff are generally forbidden from speaking to the media, and we have protected the speakers' identities because they could face disciplinary action if they are named.</p></div><div><p>\"The last shutdown was brutal\", said one federal worker, who highlighted that the impasse in 2018-19 lasted more than a month.</p><p>He added: \"It forced me to withdraw money from my retirement plan just to cover my bills. Now, they've made it more difficult to withdraw from our retirement accounts, so if this goes as long as the last shutdown, I don't know how I'm going to pay my bills.\"</p><p>The same worker said: \"I voted for Trump, but I did not vote for his abuses against us.\"</p><p>Another worker, for the Department of Homeland Security, based in New Jersey, took a slightly different view: \"Despite working without timely pay, I support the shutdown.\" </p><p>He explained: \"The president's circumvention of Congress' power of the purse has been left unchecked by the Supreme Court. Checks and balances must be maintained.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, a worker for Army Corps of Engineers said she was \"rather conflicted\" and did not mind a break from the \"gruelling end of fiscal year - a year full of constantly shifting guidance and the ever-present threat\" of a mass firing.</p><p>She said she would \"support a shutdown if anything productive comes of it, but I'm unsure anything will\".</p><p>Randall from Kansas City, who works with the Aviation Weather Center, said: \"I don't like my pay being held hostage while the government fights over separate issues.\"</p><p>He said he believed that keeping the National Weather Service funded was something both parties typically agreed, so asked why he was \"facing sudden loss of funds because Congress is fighting over healthcare or whatever\". He emphasised that these were his personal views, and not those of his agency.</p><p>An anonymous US Air Force employee told us that if the situation was not resolved, he would have nothing to live on. He expressed his dilemma as follows: \"I must still show up to work but won't get paid, because if I don't it's considered AWOL\".</p><p>A worker at the Department of the Treasury had a message to the party holding out against the spending plans of Trump's Republican party.</p><p>\"I strongly implore Democrats to stand firm and not cave to the continued assault on healthcare and affordability for everyday Americans,\" she said. She added that no amount of threats to her job would cause her to waver in her views.</p></div><p><i>Additional reporting by Kris Bramwell, Mary Litchfield, Alex Akhurst and Imogen James</i></p>",

    "body": "<div><p>Four Italian citizens have been deported from Israel after they were detained by Israeli authorities when boats sailing in a flotilla carrying aid bound for Gaza were intercepted, Israel's foreign ministry has said.</p><p>More than 470 people were detained, according to Israeli police. The ministry said authorities were in the process of deporting the others.</p><p>The deportations come as the last boat of the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) was intercepted by Israeli authorities on Friday morning.</p><p>The GSF called Israel's interceptions illegal, while Israel described the flotilla's actions as a \"provocation\".</p><p>The blocking of the flotilla sparked protests around the world, including a general strike in Italy.</p></div><div><p>The first boats were stopped on Wednesday about 70 nautical miles off the Gaza coast in international waters and others closer. Israel has been policing this area but does not have jurisdiction there.</p><p>Israel said its navy had told the boats to change course as they were \"approaching an active combat zone and violating a lawful naval blockade\", while the GSF said the interceptions were \"illegal\".</p><p>In a statement, the Israeli foreign ministry said: \"Already four Italian citizens have been deported. The rest are in the process of being deported. Israel is keen to end this procedure as quickly as possible.\"</p><p>It added that all detainees were safe and in good health. The GSF has alleged that many activists were assaulted with water cannon while their boats were intercepted. </p><p>The foreign ministry's statement mentioned the presence of Swedish activist Greta Thunberg on one of the boats, but did not give further details on her status.</p><p>In a statement on Friday morning, the GSF said: \"Over 38 hours, Israeli occupation naval forces illegally intercepted all 42 of our vesselsâeach carrying humanitarian aid, volunteers, and the determination to break Israel's illegal siege on Gaza.\" </p><p>It said the last of its boats, the Marinette, was illegally intercepted at 10:29 local time on Friday, approximately 42.5 nautical miles from Gaza in international waters.</p><p>\"Live streams and communications have been cut, and the status of participants and crew remains unconfirmed,\" the GSF said.</p><p>\"This is an illegal attack on unarmed humanitarians. We call on governments and international institutions to demand their immediate safety and release,\" it added.</p><p>In a livestream from the Marinette, one passenger was seen holding up a piece of paper to the camera reading \"We see a ship!\" just before 10:00 local time (8:00 BST).</p><p>About half an hour later, a dinghy full of armed troops wearing tactical gear pulled alongside the Marinette, with a much larger military vessel visible in the background.</p><p>The latest data on the Marinette, via the flotilla's tracking website, put it 43 nautical miles (80km) from the Gaza coast at 10:07 - shortly before it was boarded.</p><p>The majority of the vessels sailing as part of the flotilla are not visible on ship tracking sites reviewed by BBC Verify.</p><p>Five of the vessels intercepted on Thursday are now moored at the Israeli Ashdod Naval Base, tracking website Marine Traffic showed on Friday morning.</p><p>The BBC has asked the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) whether it plans to return the vessels to their owners and how long those detained will be held.</p><p>The GSF flotilla set sail for Gaza from Spain at the end of last month, with other boats joining from Tunisia and other ports later, the GSF said. </p><p>Protests in support of the flotilla and against the war in Gaza ramped up around the world as the boats neared the Strip, in countries including Spain, Italy, Colombia and Argentina.</p><p><i>Additional reporting by Matt Murphy and Richard Irvine-Brown</i></p></div>",

The national energy watchdog and Spanish lawmakers are also conducting separate investigations.</p><p>The Spanish government believes the Entso-e report supports its own findings.</p><p>Sara Aagesen, minister for ecological transition, said it was \"completely in line\" with the results of an investigation it commissioned which concluded in June that both the national grid provider Red ElÃ©ctrica and private electricity companies were at fault.</p><p>Both Red ElÃ©ctrica and the private firms have insisted that they were not to blame. Redeia, owner of Red ElÃ©ctrica, has blamed the blackout on some coal, gas and nuclear power plants' failure to help maintain appropriate voltage.</p><p>Spanish utilities said it was caused by poor planning from grid operators.</p><p>The Entso-e report also said some important data was missing and that \"collecting complete, high-quality data proved very challenging for this investigation\".</p><p>A final report, to be published in the first quarter of next year, will investigate the root causes of the overvoltage and the actions employed to control voltage in the system.</p></div><div><p>The outage triggered a broader debate that spilled into the political arena about Spain's energy model.</p><p>The opposition suggested an increasingly heavy reliance on renewable energy, promoted by the left-wing government of Pedro SÃ¡nchez, could have been a factor in causing the blackout and the country's decreasing supply of nuclear energy meant a dependable back-up was not available.</p><p>The government roundly rejected these theories and the new report was careful to avoid taking sides when it came to the causes of April's unprecedented blackout.</p><p>The loss of power forced Madrid Open Tennis organisers to stop a match half way through play. </p><p>Spain's nuclear power plants automatically stopped when the blackout hit, and the Spanish oil company Moeve said it halted operations at its oil refineries.</p><p>Buildings <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c175ykvjxyeo\">were plunged into darkness</a>, while mobile phones and traffic lights stopped working. Queues snaked around street corners and card payments failed, forcing people to queue for cash and cram on to buses as other transport systems were not running. </p><p>Emergency workers were called to 286 buildings to free people trapped inside elevators in the Madrid region and hospitals implemented emergency plans, halting routine procedures. </p></div>",

It was, he said, deliberate and the activity had increased since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Britain has half a dozen dedicated military satellites in orbit providing communications and surveillance. </p><p>In contrast, the US, China and Russia each have more than a hundred. The combined Russian and Chinese fleet of satellites has increased by 70% over the past decade. </p><p>Gen Tedman said Russia and China had both tested anti-satellite weapons. Both the UK and the US have warned that Russia has been developing the capability to put nuclear weapons in space. </p><p>While the US sees China as the pacing threat, Gen Tedman sees Russia as the more immediate danger: \"I would say the Chinese have by far the more sophisticated capability but the Russians have more will to use their counter-space systems.\"</p><p>Gen Tedman said he was \"really worried\" about what was happening in space â not just the threats but the increasing congestion. There are currently about 45,000 objects in orbit including around 9,000 satellites.

It is also taking steps to defend its satellites. This week it is announcing it will test sensors to detect laser threats in space.</p><p>Both China and Russia have developed lasers which could be used to dazzle and disrupt an adversary's satellites. </p><p>Gen Tedman said: \"We've committed to invest a billion pounds into integrated air and missile defence, and I'd be surprised if there's not a space aspect to how we're going to defend the UK from threats very similar to [America's] Golden Dome.\"</p><p>He was referring to President Donald Trump's plan to build a shield around the US against any missile attacks. </p><p>However, the UK is in danger of being left behind in the space race. Currently it spends about 1% of its defence budget on space. In contrast, France spends about 3% and the US 5%.</p><p>Gen Tedman would like to see space given a higher priority. He says around Â£450bn  of the UK economy is dependent on space. It is also the nervous system on which the UK's armed forces increasingly depend â from navigation to precision strikes.</p><p>Before we leave RAF Fylingdales, there is another reminder why space is so important. </p><p>We are warned we will have to leave the operations room if there is a real-life incident. While we are filming another alert comes through of a ballistic missile launch and we are swiftly escorted to the exit. </p><p>They are observing short-range ballistic missile launches almost every day. In this incident they will not say from where but it is no secret Russia has been firing them regularly into Ukraine. </p><p>In 2024 more than 4,000 missiles were fired around the globe. Russia was the reason why Flyingdales was first created in the Cold War era. The threat has not gone away.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, âTop political analysis in your inbox every dayâ.

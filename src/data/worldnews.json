    "body": "5 hours agoInaya MohmoodNurPhoto/GettyPolice said the woman repeatedly asked ChatGPT \"Can you die from mixing sleeping pills with alcohol?\"A 21-year-old woman in South Korea has been charged with the murders of two men, after investigators discovered she had repeatedly asked ChatGPT about the dangers of mixing drugs with alcohol.Police in Seoul say that through analysis of her mobile phone they found that the suspect, identified only by her surname Kim, had asked ChatGPT \"What happens if you take sleeping pills with alcohol?\", \"How many do you need to take for it to be dangerous?\", and \"Could it kill someone?\"Kim previously told police that she did mix prescribed sedatives containing benzodiazepines into the drinks but did not know the men would die.However a police investigator said she was \"fully aware that consuming alcohol together with drugs could result in death.\"Kim was initially arrested on 11 February on the lesser charge of inflicting bodily injury resulting in death after two men died and another was left unconscious after going to a motel with her.According to police, Kim's first alleged attack took place on 28 January when she entered a motel in Suyu-dong, Gangbuk-gu, with a man in his 20s, she left the motel alone two hours later and the man was found dead inside the room the following day.Using the same method, she allegedly killed another man in his 20s on 9 February after the two checked into a different motel in Gangbuk-gu together.However, officials said that the suspects first attempt at murder via drug misuse had occurred in December last year when she gave a drink mixed with sedatives to her partner at the time, in a cafe parking lot in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province, causing him to lose consciousness.According to police, after her first victim regained consciousness, Kim began to prepare her drinks with significantly higher doses of the drug.Police have said they plan to continue investigating whether there are additional victims beyond the three identified.More on this story",

    "body": "22 hours agoJake Horton,Ghoncheh HabibiazadandSarah JalaliBBCCrowds of mourners appear to have been fired on by a security official at a cemetery in Iran.The incident happened in Abdanan, in west Iran, on Tuesday as people gathered to commemorate those killed during the government's brutal crackdown on protesters last month.Iranians usually hold commemoration ceremonies on the 40th day after someone dies. The events have been held in several cities across the country to mourn the thousands killed during the deadliest nights of protests on 8 and 9 January.Verified video also shows people shouting anti-government chants at events in Tehran, Mashhad and Abdanan on Tuesday as crowds gathered at cemeteries and in the streets for commemorations.State-organised ceremonies were broadcast on TV and attended by senior government and military officials where people were led by organisers to chant \"death to America\".BBC Verify and BBC Persian have verified footage of people chanting \"death to Khamenei\", referencing Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. An armoured vehicle is then seen driving past the crowd of mourners as an apparent security official opens fire. People are heard screaming and seen fleeing the area as two gunshots ring out.The person who appears to be in uniform is seen pointing the gun away from the camera when the first shot is fired, before pointing the gun towards the crowd when a second shot can be heard. A puff of smoke near the gun is visible after each shot.Another verified video from the cemetery shows smoke in the distance as people run away from the scene and several gunshots can be heard.State-run IRIB News claimed that the event was peaceful and reports of people injured or killed were not true.XA billboard in the background of one the videos shows a picture of Alireza Seydi, a teenager from Abdanan who was understood to have been killed during the protests in Tehran last month and appears to be one of those commemorated during the ceremony.Weeks of anti-government protests started in late December which began over the economy but rapidly escalated. It peaked on 8 and 9 January after Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late shah, called for nationwide protests to take place. Thousands of people were killed in one of the deadliest government crackdowns in recent years. BBC Verify previously reported that it had spread to more than 68 towns and cities across the country.Khamenei last month acknowledged that thousands had been killed during the protests and blamed the US for the deaths.Additional reporting by Daniele Palumbo and Shayan Sardarizadeh",

    "body": "Do not give away Diego Garcia, Trump tells UK in fresh attack on Chagos deal8 hours agoJaroslav LukivGettyThe US had previously supported the UK's decision to proceed with the Chagos dealDonald Trump has thrown the UK's Chagos deal into doubt as he launched a stinging criticism of the plan that would see the UK hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and lease back a joint UK-US military base.The US president urged Sir Keir Starmer not to \"give away Diego Garcia\" - the largest island on the archipelago and home to the base. Trump said \"this land should not be taken away from the UK\" and if it did it would be \"a blight on our Great Ally\", in a post on social media. In response to Trump, the UK Foreign Office said the Chagos Islands deal was \"crucial to the security of the UK and our key allies, and to keeping the British people safe\".\"The agreement we have reached is the only way to guarantee the long-term future of this vital military base,\" it said in a statement.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously insisted the deal is necessary to protect the continued operation of the base, amid previous attempts from Mauritius to dispute the legality of British sovereignty over the islands.Diego Garcia is the largest island in the archipelago, and is used as a joint military base by the UK and US armed forces.Under the deal - which was announced last May - the UK will lease back Diego Garcia for a period of 99 years at an average cost of £101m a year. Trump's latest comments come ahead of talks between the US and Mauritius planned for next week.The US president's position on the issue has seen rapid U-turns in recent months - from describing the planned transfer as an \"act of great stupidity\" to saying the deal was the \"best\" the prime minister could make.UK ministers have previously said that the deal could not go ahead unless it had the support of the US.The bill, aimed at enshrining the agreement into UK law, has been delayed and there is no date set for the next stage. UK Minister Alex Davies-Jones said the bill would return to the House of Lords \"as soon as parliamentary time allows\".Posting on the Truth Social platform on Wednesday, Trump wrote: \"I have been telling Prime Minister Keir Starmer, of the United Kingdom, that Leases are no good when it comes to Countries, and that he is making a big mistake by entering a 100 Year Lease...\"The US president stressed that Diego Garcia was \"strategically located in the Indian Ocean\".\"Prime Minister Starmer is losing control of this important Island by claims of entities never known of before,\" he said. \"We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the U.K., but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them.\"And referring to ongoing US-Iran talks on Tehran's controversial nuclear programme, Trump said: \"Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia and the airfield located in Fairford in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime.\"The Republican president has repeatedly threatened to use military action against Iran over its deadly crackdown on anti-government protests and its nuclear activities. The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something that Tehran has always denied.Asked by the BBC about Trump's latest comments, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"The post should be taken as the policy of the Trump administration, it's coming straight from the horse's mouth.\"When you see it on Truth Social you know it's directly from President Trump, that's the beauty of this president in his transparency and relaying this administration's policies.\"Watch: BBC asks White House about Trump U-turn on Chagos Islands dealIn a statement, it said it \"supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago\".Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said: \"It's time Starmer finally saw sense, U-turned and scrapped this appalling deal altogether.\"Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"Trump's endless flip-flopping on the Chagos Islands shows why Starmer's approach is doomed to fail.\"Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said: \"Keir Starmer risks alienating our most important ally by giving away the Chagos Islands, the worst deal in British history.\"Earlier this week, four Chagos islanders - who are opposing the handover deal - landed on the Chagos Islands' remote atoll as part of a protest against the deal.They refused to leave it, despite a threat of eviction by a British maritime patrol.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Misley Mandarin - one of the Chagossians who had travelled to the islands - said they would have to \"drag me from my beach\".He said \"there's no reason\" for the deal \"because Mauritius never owned Chagos Islands in the first place\".\"Keir Starmer, you could be a hero right now - don't ratify that deal, cancel that deal and let Chagossians come back to their homeland as British,\" he added.The Chagos Islands – officially known as the British Indian Ocean Territory – are located about 5,799 miles (9,332km) south-east of the UK and about 1,250 miles north-east of Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean.The islands have been under British control since 1814 and were bought by the government for £3m, which led to the establishment of the islands as an overseas territory in 1965.But Mauritius has long argued that it was illegally forced to give the islands away as part of a deal to gain independence.In the late 1960s, Britain invited the US to build a military base on Diego Garcia, forcibly removing thousands of people from their homes in the process.Some of those Chagossians ended up in Mauritius and the Seychelles, but others settled in the UK, mostly in Crawley, West Sussex.",

    "body": "12 hours agoHelen LivingstoneSydneyGettyDanika Mason is one of Australia's most prominent sports reportersAn Australian sports presenter has apologised after a clip of her slurring her way through a live cross from the Winter Olympics in Italy went viral, with even Australia's prime minister weighing in.Channel Nine reporter Danika Mason said she had \"misjudged the situation\" by drinking ahead of her appearance on live television, also blaming the altitude, the cold and her failure to eat dinner.\"I want to take full responsibility, it's not the standard I set myself,\" she said during another appearance a day later, adding that she was \"embarrassed\".Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he was \"pro-Danika\" and that there was \"nothing to see here\" suggesting she had been affected by jet lag.Mason stumbled over her words and talked about iguanas and the price of coffee as she reported on the day's sports events.\"Literally like the price of coffee over here is actually fine, it's more the price of coffee in the US that we're gonna have to get used to. I'm not sure about the iguanas, where are we going with that one?\" she said during her cross to the breakfast television show Today on Wednesday, apparently in response to comments from the studio hosts.With glazed eyes she then stumbled through the rest of her sports report, mixing up her words as well as the UK and the US, while studio host Karl Stefanovic could be heard laughing in the background.\"Look the cold weather is a thing, right,\" Stevanovic said unprompted afterwards. \"You can't actually move your lips.\"Social media clips of her report prompted mixed reactions from Australians. \"Good on her, nothing wrong with this. You can tell she's having an absolute ball over there,\" said one person on X, while another commented: \"If it's not a health issue, she should be sacked on the spot - very unprofessional.\"Mason, a prominent sports reporter best known for her National Rugby League coverage, appeared again on the Today show on Thursday morning.After she delivered her live report, she told viewers she wanted to \"take a moment, if that's OK, just to apologise\" for her previous appearance.She thanked viewers for messages of concern and continued: \"I'm OK, probably just a little embarrassed. \"Look, I totally misjudged the situation, I shouldn't have had a drink, especially in these conditions, it's cold, we've got altitude, and not having had dinner probably didn't help as well. But I want to take full responsibility, it's not the standard I set myself.\"So in saying that, I'm genuinely really sorry and I'm thanking everyone for those messages I've received as well.\"The Today show host Jayne Azzopardi responded saying \"we know how hard you work, Danika\" while Stefanovic called her a \"legend\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoBrandon DrenonWatch: Eight of the nine missing skiers located deceased, officials sayRescue teams combing through the backcountry of California's Lake Tahoe region say they have found the bodies of eight skiers who went missing in an avalanche on Tuesday.The search for a final missing skier continues but that person is presumed dead, Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said at a news conference on Wednesday.Officials said one of the deceased was the spouse of someone on one of the search-and-rescue teams, making continued rescue efforts \"challenging emotionally\". Fifteen skiers were reported missing on Tuesday after a \"football-field\" sized avalanche came barrelling down in the Castle Peak area around 11:30 local time (19:30 GMT). Six have been rescued.Watch: California hit by heavy snow as avalanche leaves skiers missing\"I want to offer my condolences to the family in this very trying time,\" Placer County Sheriff Wayne Woo said on Wednesday.The bodies of the eight dead skiers were still trapped in the snow and could not yet be recovered due to \"pretty horrific\" conditions, officials said.Since the avalanche, another 3ft (90cm) of snow has fallen on the area, Tahoe National Forest supervisor Chris Feutrier said.\"The hazard remains high,\" he said.Once the bodies are recovered, they will be transported to the Placer County morgue.Families of the deceased have been notified. Authorities have not yet released any of their names.Officials say the victims are seven women and two men.Sugar Bowl Academy, a ski school in Placer County, California, said multiple members of its community had died in the avalanche. \"Emergency responders are still working to recover all of the victims and are not at this time sharing the personal details of the victims and the survivors out of respect for the families affected,\" the academy said. \"We are an incredibly close and connected community,\" executive director Stephen McMahon said. \"This tragedy has affected each and every one of us. The depth of support for the families whose lives have been changed forever reminds us of how special this community is.\"Sheriff Woo said the rescue operation was a joint effort involving two teams and roughly 50 crew members who had to traverse \"extreme weather conditions\" using specialised equipment.At 17:30 local time on Tuesday, search teams arrived to an area roughly two miles (3.2km) from where survivors were sheltering in make-shift tents, and had to ski in from there.Two of the six survivors had to be carried back and \"could not walk because of the injuries they sustained during the avalanche\", Sheriff Moon said. They were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.Among the survivors, one was a guide and five were clients of the Blackbird Mountain guided tour. The entire ski group consisted of a mix of 11 recreational skiers and four ski guides.The avalanche on Tuesday occurred as they were making their way back at the end of a three-day trip. California Governor Gavin Newsom's office said in a post on X that state authorities were \"co-ordinating an all-hands search-and-rescue effort\" with local emergency teams.Conditions on Wednesday remained dangerous, multiple officials said, with Woo describing the climate as \"treacherous\".\"Avoid the backcountry,\" he said. \"Please allow us to focus all of our resources on continuing to recover these bodies for the family and bring them home.\" The avalanche that trapped the skiers was rated as a D2.5 on a destructive potential scale of D1 to D5, according to the Sierra Avalanche Center, which would mean it was over half a mile in length and would have a deposit of around 6.5ft. The Boreal Mountain Ski Resort, which is near where the accident occurred, has reported over 30in of snowfall since Tuesday.The resort decided to close on Tuesday because of high winds and low visibility.The storm has also closed several highways, including Interstate 80 and Highway 50.",

    "body": "11 hours agoMax MatzaGetty ImagesThe White House has warned Iran would be \"very wise\" to make a deal with the US, amid reports that President Donald Trump is weighing fresh military action against the Islamic Republic.Press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a news briefing that Trump was still hoping for a diplomatic resolution over Tehran's nuclear programme. Her comments come as the US moves a second battleship into the region, and a day after progress was reported at US-Iran talks in Switzerland.US media reported on Wednesday that Trump had discussed attack options with advisers, and that a US strike could take place as early as Saturday. Last summer the US military launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities.Trump had not yet made a final decision about whether to attack and ongoing conversations were described as fluid, sources have told the BBC's US partner CBS News.Leavitt told reporters on Wednesday there were \"many reasons and arguments that one could make for a strike against Iran\".She referred to US strikes in June, adding: \"Iran would be very wise to make a deal with President Trump and with his administration.\"Although no breakthrough seemed to have emerged from Tuesday's indirect talks in Geneva, both sides indicated that there had been steps in the right direction.Iran said an understanding had been reached with the US on the main \"guiding principles\" that will frame efforts to resolve the dispute around Tehran's nuclear programme. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi added that work still needed to be done.The US said \"progress was made\" and Badr Albusaidi, the foreign minister of Oman, which is mediating the talks, said the negotiations \"concluded with good progress\" on common aims and technical issues.Asked about the Geneva negotiations, the White House press secretary said that Washington and Tehran were still \"far apart\" on some key issues.\"I think you heard from the administration and the state department yesterday that there was a little bit of progress made, but we're still very far apart on some issues,\" Leavitt said. \"I believe the Iranians are expected to come back to us with some more detail in the next couple of weeks, and so the president will continue to watch how this plays out.\"Leavitt declined to say whether Israel would be involved in the US decision.Earlier in the week, Iran said it had reached an understanding with the US on the main \"guiding principles\" to resolve their dispute over Tehran's nuclear programme.Iran has said it wants to focus discussions on its nuclear programme and the potential lifting of economic sanctions, while Washington indicated previously it wanted Iran's missile development to be part of any talks.The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something that Tehran has always denied.The US has been ramping up its military presence in the waters near Iran, and as satellite images show the Islamic Republic fortifying sensitive military sites.BBC Verify has confirmed the location of the US aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln - equipped with guided missile destroyers and dozens of fighter jets - near Iran.The US has also reportedly sent the USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, to the Middle East. It is expected to arrive in the region within the next three weeks.All US military forces deployed to the region were expected to be in place by mid-March, a US official and a senior military official told CBS.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei posted on X on Tuesday an AI-generated image of the Ford at the bottom of the ocean.\"The US President constantly says that the US has sent a warship toward Iran. Of course, a warship is a dangerous piece of military hardware,\" Khamenei's post said.\"However, more dangerous than that warship is the weapon that can send that warship to the bottom of the sea.\"Khamenei also accused the US of attempting to predetermine the outcome of negotiations and said that would be a \"wrong and foolish thing to do\".Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has responded to the US build up by launching a maritime drill in the Strait of Hormuz, located in the Gulf between Oman and Iran, on Monday.The Strait is considered a vital international waterway and oil export route from Gulf Arab states.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "7 hours agoJake Kwon,Seoul correspondentandKelly NgReutersYoon Suk Yeol's martial law order left South Korea more polarised than everYoon attempted to subvert the constitution by deploying military troops to seal off the National Assembly and ordering the arrest of politicians on 3 December 2024, a Seoul court ruled. His actions fundamentally damaged South Korea's democracy and deserves a harsh punishment, presiding judge Ji Gwi-yeon told the court. Though it was short-lived, Yoon's martial law order left the nation more polarised than ever, and those deep divisions were on full display as the sentencing took place.Huge crowds of Yoon's supporters gathered outside the court hours before the hearing, holding banners reading \"Yoon, again\". Many of them broke down in tears following the verdict.Also present were anti-Yoon protesters, rallying for him to be sentenced to death.Yoon himself showed no emotion as he learned of his fate. His lawyers alleged that the verdict was not backed by evidence and accused the judge of following a \"pre-written script\".If either side launches an appeal, the case will go up to the Supreme Court, which means it could be months before the verdict is finalised.Yoon shocked his nation on 3 December 2024 by declaring martial law on live television. He claimed it was to protect the country from \"anti-state\" forces that sympathised with North Korea, but it soon became clear he was driven by domestic troubles: the opposition which held a parliamentary majority left him a lame duck president, while his wife Kim Keon Hee was at the centre of various corruption allegations.What followed were months of political chaos, Yoon's impeachment, and a string of indictments against him and other top officials.Former prime minister Han Duck-soo was handed a 23-year jail term last month for his part in the insurrection, while ex-defence minister Kim Yong-hyun, who advised Yoon to impose martial law, was jailed for 30 years on Thursday.Former interior minister Lee Sang-min, former intelligence commander Roh Sang-won, and ex-police chief Cho Ji-ho were among the other officials jailed for what judges have described as \"an insurrection from the top\".AFP via Getty ImagesMany of Yoon's supporters broke down in tears following the verdictSecurity was tight outside the court on Thursday, with dozens of police buses forming a cordon to restrict public access. Some 1,000 officers were deployed for security operations, local media reported.Inside the court, judge Ji called Yoon the \"insurrectionist leader\", although the judging panel found insufficient evidence to rule that he'd planned the martial law order a year before his announcement.Yoon defended his actions throughout his trial, arguing that as president he had had the authority to declare martial law, sounding the alarm over opposition parties' obstruction of government.He maintained that the order was necessary \"to protect the freedom and sovereignty of the people and to preserve the nation and its constitution\".The ruling Democratic Party, which won the presidential election after Yoon's ouster, accused the court of \"undermining judicial justice\" by not sentencing Yoon to death. \"[Yoon] masterminded an insurrection that shook the very foundations of our nation,\" party leader Jung Chung-rae said.\"[Today's decision] is a clear regress from the people's revolution... The public will find it deeply unsatisfactory and unacceptable.\"South Korea has not executed anyone on death row since December 1997, so even a death penalty for Yoon would, in effect, be life imprisonment.Yoon is already serving jail time for abuse of power and obstructing his own arrest after the martial law order. He still faces three more related trials.Several former presidents before Yoon had also been convicted and jailed, but were pardoned after serving just two to five years in prison – and many expect the same for Yoon.Additional reporting by Leehyun Choi and Hosu Lee, in Seoul",

    "body": "18 hours agoLaura GozziReutersRussian, American and Ukrainian representatives met in Geneva on Tuesday and WednesdayTalks between Russia, Ukraine and the US aimed at ending Moscow's war in Ukraine have concluded without a breakthrough. The trilateral meetings, held in Geneva, went on late on Tuesday but only lasted two hours on Wednesday. Although US envoy Steve Witkoff had expressed optimism over the talks, both the chief Russian negotiator and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky indicated they had been \"difficult\".After the main talks concluded, Kremlin negotiator Vladimir Medinsky returned to the venue and held a closed-door meeting with the Ukrainian side for about an hour and a half. No details from that meeting have emerged.Some progress was made on \"military issues\", including the location of the front line and ceasefire monitoring, according to a Ukrainian diplomatic source.White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said later on Wednesday that \"there was meaningful progress\" made on both sides, and an agreement to \"continue to work towards a peace deal together\".But an agreement on the issue of territory - without which no ceasefire can be envisaged - remains elusive, with Moscow and Kyiv's positions still far apart.Russia has not budged in its demand for full control of the eastern Donbas region - made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions - which is a non-starter for Ukraine.While conceding talks were challenging, Kremlin negotiator Vladimir Medinsky added that they had been \"businesslike\" and said another meeting would take place \"soon\".Zelensky also described the negotiations as \"not easy\" due to the difference in the two sides' positions. Rustem Umerov cut a less downbeat tone, saying the discussions had been \"substantive and intensive\" and that while there had been progress, no details could be disclosed \"at this stage\".\"This is complex work that requires alignment among all parties and sufficient time,\" Umerov said.Shortly before the end of the talks was announced, Zelensky accused Russia of \"trying to drag out negotiations that could already have reached the final stage\".The Russian and Ukrainian delegations last met in US-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi earlier in February, which led to the first prisoner exchange in several months. On Wednesday, Zelensky indicated that another swap might be forthcoming. US President Donald Trump, who spearheaded diplomatic efforts to end the war, has been signalling impatience with the deadlock between the two sides. On Monday, he said Ukraine had \"better come to the table, fast\" - a sentiment Zelensky has since rejected, saying it was \"not fair\" that his country should be the one asked to compromise.Four years on from the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, substantial distance still exists between Moscow's demands and what Kyiv might consider a \"just peace\".Kyiv has long rejected Russia's demand for the eastern Donbas, which would mean relinquishing Ukrainian sovereign territory, including several heavily fortified cities and a long defensive line in the region of Donetsk. Many Ukrainians believe giving that territory up would leave the country vulnerable to another Russian invasion. Zelensky himself has drawn parallels with the 1938 Munich Agreement, when European powers let Hitler annex the Czech territory of Sudetenland.On Tuesday, Zelensky told US media outlet Axios that any plan to hand over the Donbas would be rejected by Ukrainians if it were put to a referendum. The Ukrainian president is also working to ensure that robust security guarantees to deter Russia from attacking again are provided by Kyiv's western allies.Another sticking point in the talks is the status of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.The power plant – Europe's largest – sits on the front line and has been under Russian control since March 2022. Ukraine wants Moscow to return it and Zelensky has previously said Kyiv could share control of the plant with the Americans - an arrangement Moscow is unlikely to agree to.Officials from Britain, France, Germany and Italy were present in Geneva and held talks with the Ukrainians on the sidelines of the trilateral meeting. European representatives have struggled to be included in the US-led negotiations, but Zelensky said European participation was \"indespensable\" for any final agreement.In a wide-ranging interview on Piers Morgan Uncensored on Wednesday, Zelensky confirmed there would be more talks in Switzerland and repeated that while progress had been made from a military perspective, \"on the political direction it's more difficult\".During the interview, he also said he could not really \"understand\" Trump's relationship with the Russian President Vladimir Putin, adding \"for me it's very, very painful that his attitude to Putin is sometimes...more good than Putin deserves\".Next Tuesday will mark the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war, which has resulted in tens of thousands of military and civilian casualties and displaced millions across Ukraine, continues to shape the lives of Ukrainians, with daily deadly aerial attacks across the country.Four people were killed and 30 injured in Russian artillery and air strikes overnight on Tuesday. Power infrastructure too continues to be targeted across the country, leaving millions without light or heating in one of Ukraine's coldest winters in years.",

    "body": "5 hours agoNardine SaadReutersNancy Guthrie, the mother of US broadcast journalist Savannah Guthrie, was last seen on 31 January.US investigators have reportedly been in touch with Mexican authorities about the disappearance of American news anchor Savannah Guthrie's mother, as the search stretches into a third week.The sheriff's department in the US state of Arizona and FBI declined to confirm they had contacted authorities across the border to help trace Nancy Guthrie.But her family has contacted a Mexican non-profit that works to find missing people in the region.Investigators have been sifting through 40,000 leads since the 84-year-old was reported missing this month, but a breakthrough has eluded them despite emotional public appeals for help from her NBC presenter daughter.US news website TMZ reported on Wednesday that the FBI had contacted authorities in Mexico, believing it was possible Guthrie could have been taken across the border.ABC News cited law enforcement sources as saying the FBI had notified Mexican authorities of Guthrie's disappearance, although they had no evidence she had been taken across the border.'I just believe she's somewhere here locally', Pima County sheriff tells BBCA Mexican security official told the New York Times the FBI had contacted officials in the state of Sonora, which shares a border with Arizona, to investigate an alleged \"purchase\" in the case, although that potential lead had apparently fizzled.It is standard practice for federal investigators to talk with Mexican counterparts, especially in cases so close to the border, Fox News reports.The Searching Mothers of Sonora, a Mexican non-profit dedicated to finding missing people in that state, often in cases linked to drug cartels, confirmed to CBS, the BBC's US partner, that it had been asked by a Guthrie family member to help the search. There has been no suggestion from officials that Guthrie was abducted by narco-traffickers.Watch: Video shows masked person outside Nancy Guthrie's homeTMZ also said it had received a new ransom note via email demanding about $6m (£4.5m) in cryptocurrency.The outlet, which previously reported receiving another possible Guthrie ransom note, said it had forwarded the new email to the FBI.Guthrie was last seen at her Tucson, Arizona, home on 31 January when a family member dropped her off there after an evening at her daughter's house nearby.Investigators believe she was abducted in the early hours of 1 February.Officials say her family members have been ruled out as possible suspects.On Tuesday, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told the BBC that DNA evidence taken from a glove found near Guthrie's home had produced no matches in a FBI database.The glove had appeared to match ones worn by a masked man captured on surveillance footage on the night Guthrie vanished.Watch: 'It is never too late to do the right thing' Savannah Guthrie says in appeal to suspected abductorThe sheriff said he was confident they would find her, whether it took \"10 days, 10 months, or worse\".Nanos also said he believed Guthrie was being held somewhere close to her home.The sheriff also told the BBC's US partner CBS News on Wednesday that investigators had not ruled out a theory that an accomplice was also involved in the suspected abduction. Investigators are now using a device that might be able to detect Bluetooth signals coming from her pacemaker, law enforcement sources told CBS.The sources said the tool, called a \"signal sniffer\", was mounted on a helicopter.Guthrie's pacemaker was disconnected from her phone app on the night of her disappearance.",

The performance charted Lula's path from poverty as a shoeshine boy to eventually reaching the highest post in the country. Tiago Martins, a carnival parade designer at the school, called it a deeply personal story.\"The samba says it: there are children of the poor becoming doctors, and me, a child of the poor, becoming a carnival designer,\" he told Reuters. \"We wanted to tell the story of a man who did a lot for the poor and for Brazil.\"Getty ImagesMembers of Acadêmicos de Niterói perform However, the opposition criticised the decision to spotlight a sitting president as a sign of early campaigning ahead of the October elections, with Lula seeking a fourth term.Several lawsuits alleging that Lula could gain a political advantage from the tribute were filed but rejected by the courts, with opposition parties even requesting the parade to be blocked.Lula himself gave his blessing to the performance of Acadêmicos de Niterói and watched it with thousands of people from the stands in the city's giant Sambadrome arena.Getty ImagesBrazil's president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva watching the show from the standsAnother pointed political message during Acadêmicos de Niterói's performance was a display of former far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro as Bozo the Clown sitting behind bars.The ex-president's son Flávio Bolsonaro has vowed to appeal a decision by the electoral court after it rejected requests by two opposition parties to prevent the parade.Many on social media also took issue with a performance by dancers dressed as a traditional family preserved in a tin can titled \"preserved neoconservatives\" as mocking Christian values.Getty ImagesBolsonaro depicted as Bozo the Clown by Acadêmicos de NiteróiGetty ImagesRevellers of the Unidos do Viradouro samba school who took the crownDespite the controversy, the parade of giant lions, dancing books and rainbow coloured plumes still delighted the crowds.The performances are judged over 10 categories by a total of 40 judges, with the top 12 samba schools competing for the title.Getty ImagesA float of the Unidos do Viradouro samba schoolGetty ImagesDancing books, anyone?Getty ImagesA sea of green and yellow celebrates the colours of the Brazilian flagGetty ImagesColour, colour and more colour was the night's unofficial theme",

In a statement on Thursday, the Russian embassy in Nairobi dismissed the allegations as \"dangerous and misleading\", saying that its staff has never been involved in \"rogue schemes\" or engaged in illegal enlistment.\"At no point in time throughout the ongoing crisis in Ukraine [has] the Embassy  ever issued visas to Kenyan citizens who sought to travel to Russia with the stated pose of participating in the Special Military Operation (SMO) in Ukraine.\"Nor the Embassy been encouraging any Kenyan citizen to do so.\"The embassy added that while it does not recruit foreigners, Russian law allows foreign nationals who are legally in Russia to voluntarily enlist in their armed forces. While in parliament, Ichung'wah said that Kenya's ambassador to Moscow \"must be able to identify the officers within the embassy that may have colluded with these criminals. Our embassy must be beyond reproach. It must be the place where Kenyans can seek refuge, not exploitation.\"\"Government offices are not to be used for criminal activities,\" he added. The BBC has asked the Kenyan foreign ministry for comment.The report did not say what had happened to the majority of the recruits but said that in addition to those on the front line, another 35 had been sent to military camps in Russia, 39 are injured and 28 are missing.According to the investigation, ex-military personnel, ex-police officers and unemployed Kenyans aged 20–50 are the main targets of the recruiters.Recruits are promised a monthly pay of up to 350,000 Kenyan shillings ($2,400; £2,000), with bonuses ranging from KSh 900,000 to KSh 1.2 million ($6,200–$8,300;£5,200–£7,000).However, upon arrival, many reportedly find themselves deployed to front-line combat roles after minimal military training.\"They are told you are going to work as a guard… only to get there and you are taken to military camps,\" Ichung'wah said.\"You've only trained for three weeks. They are basically just giving you a gun to go and die,\" he added. Those undergoing explosives and weapons training are only required to attend training for nine days before being sent to the front line, the report said. Ichung'wah said that, initially, recruits departed through Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) using tourist visas and travelled through Turkey and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).However, with heightened surveillance at JKIA, traffickers reportedly changed tactics, rerouting victims through South Africa, Uganda and other neighbouring states.The report identified some of the rogue agencies behind the recruitment of Kenyans and the medical facilities used for testing.Authorities say several suspects, including the alleged mastermind, remain under active investigation, with further arrests expected. Investigations continue as officials seek additional suspects and work to rescue Kenyans still caught in the conflict.Speaking to the BBC last week, Kenya's Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi said Nairobi had shut down more than 600 recruitment agencies suspected of duping Kenyans with promises of jobs overseas.Mudavadi said Kenya was working closely with Russia on curbing illegal recruitment practices, including discussions on visa policy and bilateral labour agreements excluding military conscription.The foreigner minister is due to visit Moscow next month to discuss the matter. So far 27 Kenyans who had been fighting in Russia have been repatriated, he said, with authorities providing psychological care to address their trauma and \"de-radicalise\" them.Pressure has been mounting on the Kenyan government to act after the recent discovery of more bodies of nationals of African countries who had been recruited to fight for Russian armed forces.Last November, Ukraine's foreign minister said that more than 1,400 people from 36 countries in Africa had been recruited to fight for Russia. Ukraine has also previously come in for criticism for trying to recruit foreign nationals, including Africans, to fight on its side.Ukrainian officials have repeatedly warned that anyone fighting for Russia will be treated as an enemy combatant, and that the only safe route out is to surrender and be treated as a prisoner of war.You may also be interested in: Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Suspected carbon-monoxide leak kills at least 30 miners in Nigeria, witnesses say5 hours agoMansur AbubakarAbujaBBCMany mourners came to the funeral prayers and burial of the miners, who were aged between 20 and 40At least 33 miners have died in a suspected carbon-monoxide leak at a lead and zinc mine in central Nigeria's Plateau state, witnesses have told the BBC.The tragedy is believed to have happened just before sunrise at a site outside the town of Wase run by the mining company Solid Unity Nigeria Ltd.Toxic gas is believed to have built up underground in poorly ventilated tunnels, causing the workers to collapse just before the end of their night shift.They were discovered by those reporting to work in the morning - more than 20 other miners were rescued and rushed to hospital for treatment.Security personnel have sealed off the mine, which is about 200km (124 miles) south-east of the state capital of Jos, as investigations get under way to find out the cause of the leak.State officials are yet to visit the area and response efforts have reportedly been slow because of security concerns - armed criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, have been active there in recent years.The Nigerian government has suspended mining licences in the affected area and ordered an investigation, vowing to release further details in due course.Safiyanu Haruna, one of the miners who found the bodies at the start of his shift, told the BBC that some of the miners who were underground survived and were taken to a hospital in Wase for treatment.According to Haruna, the incident occurred at around 06:30 local time (05:30 GMT) killing 37 miners.He said the miners had just finished performing their early morning Muslim prayers and had returned underground to finish their shift.The Plateau state government has issued a statement saying that according to its preliminary investigation 33 miners were killed in a blast at the mine - but workers at the scene say this is not the case.\"It was carbon-monoxide gas that leaked and killed them,\" Haruna said.\"There was no rescue for them at the time because those who were coming for the morning shift had yet to arrive,\" he said.\"It is sad to lose 37 miners who were struggling to make ends meet. We're disturbed by the incident.\"The victims, believed to be men aged between 20 and 40, were buried shortly afterwards in accordance with local tradition, another local resident told the BBC.The news has devastated the mainly Muslim community.Mining disasters occur relatively frequently in Nigeria.Less than two years ago, dozens of gold miners died after being trapped underground when a pit collapsed in neighbouring Niger state.Officials believe that incident was caused by torrential rains which had softened the soil.The tragedy is likely to renew concerns over safety standards in Nigeria's mining sector.Additional reporting by Ado Musa in Wase and Madina Maishanu More BBC stories on Nigeria:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

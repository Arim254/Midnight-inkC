The popular US dancing competition sees stars paired with professional dancers to perform in front of a panel of judges, with the audience also voting on their favourite couple.The 21-year-old was favoured to win, with strong performances over the show's 11 weeks, including a tribute to his father and a surprise appearance from his sister Bindi. With a legion of fans in the US, Irwin's finale had an Australian bent with one dance choreographed to a song by Australian rock band Jet.During the three-hour finale on Tuesday evening, local time, Irwin and his dance partner Witney Carson also performed to songs by Avicii and Sydney-born Sam Sparro.They then triumphed in the \"instant dance challenge\" – where Irwin and Carson were told the style and song minutes before taking to the stage.Irwin, who competed in the final despite having a rib injury, beat fellow finalists including influencer Alix Earle and Olympic gymnast Jordan Chiles.This came despite three contestants - not including Irwin - earning a perfect score of 30 for their first dances. However, Irwin got a perfect score not long after.Getty ImagesThe pair triumphed in the \"instant dance challenge\"He broke down in tears after his final performance, saying that said he wanted to make his father proud.\"I wish he could see it, I really wish he could be here,\" he said.Steve Irwin was famous for his TV wildlife shows which regularly saw him handling crocodiles and led to him being dubbed the \"Crocodile Hunter\".He was killed by a stingray during a diving expedition off the Australian coast in 2006, when Robert was just a baby. Following his father's love for wildlife, Robert Irwin has long been a keen photographer and recently became an Earthshot ambassador.",

    "body": "A Chicago man who allegedly doused a woman in gasoline and lit her on fire on 17 November was a \"career criminal\", the White House has said. Lawrence Reed who was arrested for the crime had 72 prior arrests that include eight felony convictions and seven misdemeanours, according to the White House. The victim, 26-year-old Bethany MaGee, survived the attack but is \"now fighting for her life with horrific burns\", the White house said in a statement.In court on Monday, Mr Reed yelled three times in succession \"I'm guilty\", after the judge warned he could receive a life sentence for charges that include committing a terrorist attack, according to reports from inside the courtroom. The White House has sought to blame the incident on Democrats' policies on crime, casting them as \"soft\". Both the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago are led by Democrats, and President Donald Trump is currently seeking to withhold federal funds from Illinois over its elimination of \"cash bail\", where an arrested person posts a sum of money to be released from jail before trial.The suspect \"was walking free because of the radical, dangerous 'no cash bail' law proudly signed by Governor JB Pritzker and celebrated by Chicago's defund-the-police Mayor Brandon Johnson\", the White House said in a statement it released on Tuesday. Mayor Johnson said in a statement that the attack \"was a tragic incident, and the Mayor's prayers are with the victim and her family.\"Mr Reed, 50, has a history of mental illness and has been arrested 72 times since he turned 18, according to a Chicago affiliate of the BBC's partner CBS News.In August, he was charged with aggravated battery for allegedly hitting a social worker and after his arrest was released with electronic monitoring against prosecutors' objections. The attack against Ms MaGee happened while she was \"minding her own business and reading her phone\", prosecutors said. According to the criminal complaint, she was approached by Mr Reed arriving from the back of the train car who then doused her with gasoline before she ran.As he chased her, the complaint said, Mr Reed ignited the rest of the liquid in the bottle and set Ms MaGee on fire. Footage of the incident appeared to show Mr Reed watching Ms MaGee as she rolled on the floor engulfed in flames attempting to extinguish the fire. Last week,  Mayor Johnson said the attack \"should have never happened\", characterising it as \"an absolute failure of our criminal justice as well as our mental health institutions\". He said the suspect clearly faced mental health challenges and presented a danger to himself and the community.As a county commissioner, Johnson in 2020 introduced a nonbinding resolution to redirect funds from police and jails to other public services, but while running for mayor in 2023 he promised not to cut police spending.",

    "body": "A parking inspector and his wife have been arrested on suspicion of embezzling more than €1m (£878,000) from a small German town's parking meters.The unnamed municipal employee is thought to have taken coins out of parking meters in Kempten \"on numerous occasions\" and placed them in bank accounts that his wife had access to, local police said in a statement.A money laundering report by a credit institution alerted investigators to the suspected theft. The inspector faces charges relating to 720 alleged incidents of theft, while his wife faces charges of aiding and abetting theft, also in 720 cases.Kempten Mayor Thomas Kiechle said he was \"stunned and dismayed\" by the allegations. In October, the Kempten public prosecutor's office was informed that cash was repeatedly being deposited into several bank accounts, according to the German news agency DPA.Police then searched office premises in the early hours of 24 November, the same day that the 40-year-old man and 38-year old woman were arrested.They are now being held in separate detention facilities.It is not clear how long it might have taken the couple to accrue the sum.In response to the allegations, Kiechle announced the appointment of a commission to \"review past work processes, uncover potential weaknesses, and reliably remedy them for the future.\"Kiechle noted that the names of the couple could not currently be released due to the ongoing investigation and privacy concerns.In a written statement, Kiechle said: \"I naturally support the public prosecutor's office and the police in their thorough investigation of the allegations.\"\"Until the proceedings are concluded, the presumption of innocence applies,\" he added.Kempten is one of the oldest settlements in Germany. Located in the country's south, it sits under the hills of the Allgäu and has around 70,000 residents.",

    "body": "Australia's landmark social media ban for children is being challenged in the nation's highest court, with two teenagers alleging the law is unconstitutional as it robs them of their right to free communication.From 10 December, social media firms - including Meta, TikTok and YouTube - must ensure that Australians aged under 16 cannot hold accounts on their platforms.The law, which is being watched closely around the world, was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful content and algorithms. However, 15-year-olds Noah Jones and Macy Neyland - backed by a rights group - will argue the ban completely disregards the rights of children.\"We shouldn't be silenced. It's like Orwell's book 1984, and that scares me,\" Macy Neyland said in a statement.After news of the case broke, Communications Minister Anika Wells told parliament the government would not be swayed.\"We will not be intimidated by threats. We will not be intimidated by legal challenges. We will not be intimidated by big tech. On behalf of Australian parents, we will stand firm,\" she said.The Digital Freedom Project (DFP) announced the case had been filed in the High Court on Wednesday. Teenagers rely on social media for information and association, and a ban could hurt the nation's most vulnerable kids - young people with disability, First Nations youth, rural and remote kids and LGBTIQ+ teenagers - the most, the group said on their website.Led by a New South Wales parliamentarian, John Ruddick, DFP said their challenge would hinge on the ban's impact on political communication, and whether it was proportional to the law's aims.Other measures to improve online safety should be used instead, the group argued, pointing to digital literacy programmes, the forced introduction of age-appropriate features for platforms, and age assurance technologies which have greater privacy protections.Noah Jones argued the government's policy was \"lazy\". \"We are the true digital natives and we want to remain educated, robust, and savvy in our digital world... They should protect kids with safeguards, not silence.\"Australian media have previously reported that Google, which owns YouTube, has also been considering launching a constitutional challenge.Though opposed by the tech companies who will be charged with enforcing it, the ban is supported by most Australian adults, according to polls. However, some mental health advocates say it may cut kids off from connection, and others say it could push youngsters to even-less-regulated corners of the internet.",

    "body": "Watch: Police share footage of prison cell for Brazil's former President BolsonaroBrazil's Supreme Court has ordered that right-wing former president Jair Bolsonaro begin serving his prison sentence of 27 years and three months for plotting a coup after he lost the last election.Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Tuesday ruled that the case had reached its final judgement and that no further appeals were possible. Bolsonaro, 70, was found guilty of leading a conspiracy aimed at keeping him in power after he lost the 2022 election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.He will begin serving his sentence in a federal police jail cell in the capital, Brasilia, where he has been detained since Saturday after being deemed a flight risk and removed from home detention. At a hearing on Sunday, Bolsonaro admitted trying to open his ankle monitor with a soldering iron until he \"came to his senses\", court documents show. He said he had had no intention of fleeing and blamed medicine-induced \"paranoia\" for damage he caused to the monitor. Justice Moraes on Tuesday mandated that full-time medical care be given to Bolsonaro, whose medical team has previously said he is suffering from worsening health.Supreme Court justices said in September, when Bolsonaro was found guilty of plotting a coup, that he had known of plans to assassinate Lula and his vice-presidential running mate, Geraldo Alckmin, and to arrest and execute Moraes, who has been overseeing Bolsonaro's trial.The conspiracy failed to get the backing of the army and air force commanders. Lula was sworn in without incident on 1 January 2023.But a week later, on 8 January, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings in Brasília. The security forces intervened and about 1,500 people were arrested.The justices found that the rioters had been incited by Bolsonaro, whose plan, they said, was for the military to step in and return him to power.Bolsonaro was also barred from running for public office until 2060 - eight years after the end of his sentence.The former president called the trial a \"witch hunt\" designed to prevent him running in the 2026 presidential election.Justice Moraes also ordered on Tuesday that others found guilty of being Bolsonaro's co-conspirators must begin their sentences.They include Gen Augusto Heleno, former minister for institutional security, and Gen Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira, former defence minister.",

    "body": "1 hour agoKwasi Gyamfi AsieduandKayla EpsteinA Georgia judge has dismissed the sprawling 2020 election interference case against Donald Trump, ending the final effort to prosecute the president for allegedly attempting to overturn his loss to Joe Biden.Peter Skandalakis, who took over the case after the initial prosecutor's removal, asked Judge Scott McAfee to dismiss the charges on Wednesday.Trump's lawyer Steve Sadow praised the decision to end the \"political persecution\" against the president.The dismissal concludes the last of Trump's four criminal cases, only one of which saw trial and resulted in a conviction.A Georgia appeals court removed Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the case after it determined a romantic relationship with a special prosecutor created an \"appearance of impropriety\".Skandalakis, executive director of the nonpartisan agency Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia, appointed himself to the case after Willis' disqualification and when other state prosecutors declined to take the case.In Wednesday's motion to a Fulton County judge, he said he was discontinuing the case \"to serve the interests of justice and promote judicial finality.\"\"As a former elected official who ran as both a Democrat and a Republican and now is the Executive Director of a non-partisan agency, this decision is not guided by a desire to advance an agenda but is based on my beliefs and understanding of the law,\" Skandalakis added.Around five million votes for president were cast in Georgia in 2020, with Biden winning the critical swing state by just under 12,000 votes.Trump and some of his allies refused to accept the result, and the state quickly became a focal point for efforts to overturn the election.In January 2021, The Washington Post published a recording of Trump speaking with Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.\"I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state,\" Trump said in the recording.Willis began investigating Trump's activities soon after the report, convening a special grand jury to weigh the facts.Willis filed an indictment in August 2023 alleging that Trump conspired with 18 other defendants to interfere in the election result. The charges included racketeering and other state offences.The group \"refused to accept that Trump lost, and they knowingly and wilfully joined a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome of the election in favor of Trump\".Four co-defendants took plea deals with prosecutors that resulted mostly in fines, suspended sentences and community service, including attorneys Sidney Powell, Kenneth Cheseboro, and Jenna Ellis. Wednesday's dismissal also applies to the remaining co-defendants, including former New York mayor and Trump's former attorney Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows, chief of staff during Trump's first presidency.Mr Sadow, president Trump's lead attorney in the case, praised the decision to drop the charges.\"The political persecution of President Trump by disqualified DA Fani Willis is finally over,\" he said. \"This case should never have been brought. A fair and impartial prosecutor has put an end to this lawfare.\"The Georgia election interference case was once considered the most threatening of Trump's four criminal indictments, because he could not pardon himself from state-level charges if he returned to office. Prosecutors brought Trump to the Fulton County Jail, where they took his mugshot.Legal experts who closely followed the case were not surprised by its dismissal. A judge tossed out several of the charges in 2024, and Willis was disqualified a few months later.Willis' removal raised doubts about whether a replacement would take up such a complicated prosecution. Trump's election essentially put his case on hold until his term ends in 2029. \"It was incredibly unlikely it was going to go forward anyway, because the amount of financial resources and man hours necessary to take on this case didn't seem to be within the scope of what Peter Skandalakis had,\" said Anthony Michael Kreis, a professor at the Georgia State College of Law.However, Mr Kries was surprised by some of Skandalakis' reasoning for dropping the case.\"I think the report itself to me is a little more surprising because it seems to give the president and some of his allies a lot of benefit of the doubt, given what the evidence brought forth looked like,\" he said.",

    "body": "France's highest court has upheld a sentence against former French President Nicolas Sarkozy over the illegal financing of his 2012 re-election campaign.He was found guilty of overspending on his campaign, then hiring a PR firm named Bygmalion to cover it up.Sarkozy, 70, was handed the one-year sentence in 2024 of which six months were suspended, meaning they could be served by wearing an electronic tag instead of going to jail.He has always denied all allegations. Prosecutors in the case said Sarkozy's UMP party spent nearly double the €22.5m (£19.4m) cap on his campaign, splurging on lavish campaign rallies and events.To hide the costs, UMP then asked Bygmalion to invoice the party, rather than the campaign.Today's is the second definitive conviction for the former president, who was in power from 2007 to 2012.Last December the High Court of Appeal upheld a corruption conviction and Sarkozy had to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet for six months.Then, in September, he was sentenced to five years in jail after being found guilty of criminal conspiracy.He spent 20 days in jail before he was released earlier in November. An appeal trial will be held next year. Until then Sarkozy will be subject to strict judicial supervision and barred from leaving France.Days after his release, Sarkozy's team announced the former president was writing a book about his three weeks in jail, titled \"A prisoner's diary\". An excerpt from the book was published on social media: \"In prison there is nothing to see, and nothing to do. I forget the silence that does not exist at La Santé [prison], where there is much to listen to. Here, the noise is, unfortunately, constant. But - like in the desert - inner life strengthens in jail.\"",

It comes after months of Greene's blistering criticism on the Trump administration's refusal to release files related to the investigation into the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein - as well as several of Trump's policy positions.Rumours have already begun circulating that Greene, 51, might run for president in 2028, which she immediately shot down. So, if not the Oval Office, what is next for Greene? Run for president in 2028Although she claims she has no interest in the presidency now, having a future change of heart is not an unknown feature of US politics.When Greene signed a petition to force a vote requiring the release of the files related to Epstein - over Trump's objections - it went on to a bill authored by her Democratic colleague, Ro Khanna. Khanna told NBC News after Greene's latest announcement that she was \"likely to be a formidable 2028 candidate\", adding that she was \"more in touch\" with Trump's base than his number two, Vice-President JD Vance. Time Magazine also reported that Greene \"privately told allies\" she was considering a presidential bid, but Greene quickly dismissed the assertion as a \"complete lie\".\"I'm not running for President and never said I wanted to and have only laughed about it when anyone would mention it,\" Greene wrote on social media, re-posting Time Magazine's article. Greene has notably distanced herself from her party's positions - and from the president - for whom she once was an ardent supporter. She has spoken out against issues including Epstein files, Trump's global tariffs, support for Israel and healthcare funding. A possible run for governor or Senate Greene has not been quite as explicit about ruling out the possibility of running for Georgia governor or to represent her state in the US Senate.Elections for both take place in 2026.Two-time Republican Georgia Governor Brian Kemp is up against his term limit and unable to run again, widening the field of possible replacements. Greene could also use her clout to pursue the race for the US Senate and attempt to unseat Democrat Jon Ossoff, who is up for re-election next year.Both the role of governor and US senator are ones that Greene has expressed interest in, at least according to Trump.In the president's public spat with Greene following her resignation announcement, Trump wrote on social media that the feud began \"when I sent her a Poll stating that she should not run for Senator, or Governor\".\"She was at 12%, and didn't have a chance (unless, of course, she had my Endorsement — which she wasn't about to get!)\", he said.Kennesaw State University Professor of Political Science Kerwin Swint, who lives in Greene's congressional district, says that Trump is aware of her unpopularity outside of her immediate district, and that she would probably \"get obliterated\" if she ran for statewide office.Without those options, the only other office she may have her sights on is president, despite her protestations.\"I don't see that happening,\" Swint says. \"She would be such an amazing longshot to dark horse. \"But most politicians have a big enough ego that they look in the mirror, they see a future president. So it's not out of the question.\"Entering the conservative media landscape Swint predicts that she'll start a podcast and attempt to remain in the public spotlight by continuing to build her media profile.\"I think she wants to be an influencer basically. And so I think someone who wants to do that is going to reach for these media opportunities,\" he says.If she chooses a life outside of politics, Greene would join a host of former politicians and political operatives who have launched careers in the podcast arena. After Republican Representative Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress to accept his failed nomination to become Trump's US attorney general, he started his own podcast. The trend has even caught hold on the left, with Democrats like California Governor Gavin Newsom also hosting his own podcast. Meanwhile, FBI deputy director Dan Bongino went on to join the Trump administration after success as a radio host and commentator.Greene could also decide to become a conservative commentator on more left-leaning networks, like CNN, where she has made frequent appearances in recent days. \"I knew she was going to be the next co-host of The View!\", conservative personality Megan McCain wrote on X, referring to Greene's recent appearance on ABC's liberal-leaning daily chat show.Leave politics behind completelyIn the 10-minute video announcing her resignation, Greene also suggested she might leave politics to spend more time with her family who she said she missed \"precious time with\" as she fought for Trump. Throughout her time in politics, Greene said, she faced \"never ending personal attacks\" and \"threats\". \"It has been unfair and wrong, not only to me, but especially to my family,\" she said.  Since her public feud with the president, Greene said the threats against her have only increased.In addition to being a member of Congress, Greene is also the owner of a commercial construction and renovation company called Taylor Commercial. The company has managed roughly $250m in construction projects, since Greene acquired it in 2002, according to her website. With reporting by Max Matza",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has defended special envoy Steve Witkoff as doing the \"standard thing\" after a leaked recording appeared to show him advising a Russian official on how to appeal to the president.Trump told reporters on Wednesday he had not heard the audio, but that Witkoff was doing \"what a dealmaker does\" to \"sell\" the peace plan to both Russia and Ukraine.The leaked call from last month emerged days after a 28-point draft peace plan presented by the US largely reflected Russian positions on its full-scale war in Ukraine.Witkoff has visited Moscow several times this year and will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin again next week.He has never gone to Kyiv in his role as special envoy, although other US officials have visited and US army secretary Dan Driscoll went to Kyiv this week and Trump says he will hold further talks with the Ukrainians.Diplomatic talks have continued after the initial draft plan was criticised by Ukrainian and European leaders as being too favourable to Russia. Among the proposals was a handover to Russia of Ukrainian-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine.The plan has since been revised to better reflect Ukraine's interests and the views of European allies. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he is ready to meet Trump to discuss outstanding \"sensitive points\".In the leaked audio recording obtained and shared as a transcript by Bloomberg, Witkoff appeared to advise Yuri Ushakov, Putin's foreign policy adviser, on how to get on Trump's good side.BBC News has not independently verified the reported 14 October call, but Trump said it represented a \"very standard form of negotiations\". During the leaked conversation, the two men reportedly talked about ending the war, with Ushakov asking if it would be useful to get their bosses - Putin and Trump - to speak.Witkoff is quoted as saying that \"my guy is ready to do it\", before suggesting how to go about the call.\"Just reiterate that you congratulate the president [Trump] on this achievement... that you respect that he is a man of peace and you're just, you're really glad to have seen it happen,\" Witkoff is quoted as saying. \"I think from that it's going to be a really good call.\"\"I told the president that you - that the Russian Federation has always wanted a peace deal. That's my belief,\" Witkoff adds according to the transcript. \"The issue is is that we have two nations that are having a hard time coming to a compromise.\"\"I'm even thinking that maybe we set out like a 20-point peace proposal, just like we did in Gaza,\" Witkoff adds.The call ends with Witkoff telling Ushakov of an imminent Zelensky visit to the White House and that \"if possible\", Trump and Putin should talk before that meeting.What followed was a two-and-a-half hour phone call between the US and Russian presidents, news of which emerged as Zelensky was on his way to Washington last month.Before the Trump-Putin call, the US president had appeared to be running out of patience with his Russian counterpart and had suggested he might provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles.By the time Zelensky entered the White House, the atmosphere appeared to have changed. Trump said giving Kyiv Tomahawks could escalate the conflict and he believed Putin \"wants to end the war\".Asked about the call being leaked, Yuri Ushakov told Russian state media that it was done to \"hinder, probably\" and that it was \"unlikely\" to be done to improve relations.He also confirmed that Witkoff would be visiting Moscow next week as per a \"preliminary agreement\".It was not clear who was behind the leak, but Bloomberg has also transcribed another reported call between Ushakov and Putin envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who spent days with Witkoff in Miami in late October weeks before the 28-point draft plan emerged.According to the transcript, Dmitriev tells his Russian colleague: \"We'll just make this paper from our position, and I'll informally pass it along, making it clear that it's all informal. And let them do like their own.\"Apparently angered by the report, Dmitriev complained of a \"well-funded, well-organised malicious media machine built to spread fake narratives, smear opponents and keep people confused\".",

    "body": "A mother in New Zealand who killed her two children and hid their bodies in suitcases has been sentenced to life in prison.Hakyung Lee, who was found guilty in September of the shocking murders of eight-year-old Yuna Jo and six-year-old Minu Jo, has to spend at least 17 years behind bars before she is eligible for parole.Lee, 45, argued she was insane at the time of the killings in 2018, which happened soon after her husband died. High Court judge Geoffrey Venning said Lee's mental health played a part in the case, but that her actions were calculated.The children's remains were discovered only in 2022 by a couple who won an auction for the contents of an abandoned storage unit in Auckland.During a trial lasting more than two weeks, Hakyung Lee's defence lawyers told the court that her mental health deteriorated after Jo's death, and that she came to believe it was best if the rest of the family died together. Lee tried to kill herself and her children by giving them a dose of the antidepressant nortriptyline mixed in juice, but got the dose wrong and woke up to find her children were dead, her lawyers said.Prosecutors argued that Lee's was \"a selfish act to free herself from the burden of parenting alone\".After the killings, Lee changed her name and left New Zealand. She was arrested in South Korea - where she was born - in September 2022, and extradited back to New Zealand later that year.The court heard on Wednesday how the killings pained Lee's and her husband Ian Jo's families.In an emotional statement read out by prosecutors, Lee's mother Choon Ja Lee  said she regrets not taking her daughter to a counsellor, noting that Lee had \"no will to live\" after Jo died of cancer in November 2017.\"If she wanted to die, why didn't she die alone? Why did she take the innocent children with her?\" Choon Ja Lee wrote, according to New Zealand media reports.Jo's brother Jimmy said he \"never imagined such a profound tragedy would ever befall our family\".His own mother - Yuna's and Minu's other grandmother - still does not know they are dead, he said.\"It was my late brother's will that I protect them,\" said Jimmy Jo. \"This is an ongoing sentence from which I can never be paroled.\"Lee was likely suffering from an \"atypical depression\" and prolonged grief reaction at the time of the murders, according to a psychiatric assessment conducted before the sentencing, local broadcaster RNZ reported.Justice Venning ordered that Lee be treated as a \"special patient\" during her imprisonment, given her mental state.\"You could not cope when [your husband] became seriously unwell, and perhaps you could not bear to have the children around you as a constant reminder of your former happy life, which had been cruelly taken from you,\" the judge said.",

    "body": "2 days agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent , Geneva Donald Trump wants a peace deal in Ukraine very badly.Kyiv wants peace even more, just not at any cost.That's why when the US began pushing it to agree to a deal by Thanksgiving on what looked close to surrender terms, Ukraine pushed back.It scrambled senior officials to talks in Geneva and all of Sunday we saw delegates from the US and Ukraine shuttling back and forth between the two main venues in black limousines with darkened windows.They were joined by national security advisers from Germany, France and the UK.The only time I glimpsed Andriy Yermak, heading the negotiating team from Kyiv, he looked stony-faced.No wonder: the starting proposal on the table was so skewed towards Russia's demands, the talks began with the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio having to deny it had been written by the Kremlin.But Donald Trump had been clear that Ukraine needed to sign up fast or face unspecified consequences. So Kyiv had to engage.On Sunday night, Marco Rubio declared there'd been \"tremendous progress\" in the talks with just a \"couple of things\" still outstanding. When pressed, he wouldn't be more specific, calling the situation \"delicate\".But a joint Ukraine-US statement says there's now a whole new deal in play, which it calls an \"updated and revised framework document\".We haven't seen that yet. The Financial Times newspaper quotes one of the delegates, though - Ukraine's deputy foreign minister Sergiy Kyslytsya - who talks of a new 19-point plan with \"very little left\" from the original draft.That new document likely incorporates at least some of the amendments proposed by the Europeans and published by Reuters news agency that point to something far more palatable for Kyiv.In that version, an automatic veto on future Ukrainian Nato membership is gone - as well as a cap on troop numbers for the country's armed forces.It says no Western troops would be deployed to Ukraine permanently, but that's not an all-out ban.On the sensitive question of territory – land Ukrainian soldiers have been fighting and dying to defend for 11 years – there would be no handover of the rest of the Donbas region to Russia for free, and Ukraine would aim to recover occupied areas through exclusively diplomatic means. That's something Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously accepted. The full amnesty for war crimes is deleted, too.But most critically, there's reference to security guarantees.Several officials, including the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, have talked about Ukraine getting Article 5-style protection, meaning the US would be bound to come to its defence if Russia ever invaded again.That's the key issue which Ukraine says it can't negotiate on.We don't know how many of these European ideas have made it into the new proposal, but Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz calls the deal \"significantly modified\" – in a positive sense.So how did we get from a pro-Russian deal to this in just a day? It's hard to be sure, with US hawks like President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff in the room.The initial Kremlin-friendly plan was rooted in Witkoff's own visit to Russian President Vladimir Putin this spring, when he returned quoting Russia's controversial narratives almost verbatim.Instead, this plan seems like something Ukraine might sign up to – eventually.Which must be why Trump has gone from berating officials in Kyiv, again, for supposedly showing him \"zero gratitude\", to proclaiming that \"something good\" may be coming.But how good? There is still no sign that Russia is ready to give up fighting unless it's forced to.\"Putin is much more self-confident militarily, right now,\" Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center believes.She points to a corruption scandal and political crisis in Kyiv, problems mobilising soldiers there, and military gains for Russian forces on the ground – all driving Putin's thinking.At best, some suggest Trump's demand for a deal has injected new momentum into efforts to find peace, which Ukrainians, under fire, desperately want.But it's hard to escape the sense that these days of frantic diplomacy have only brought us back to where we started\"Russia's position is, 'we have laid out our demands, so do you take them or not?' Stanovaya said. \"'If so, we will stop the war – if not, we'll just wait until you're ready.'\"",

    "body": "14 hours agoJon DonnisonCorrespondent, JerusalemZaher IbrahimMohammed Ibrahim was 15 when he was arrested at his family's holiday home in the occupied West BankA Palestinian-American teenager is expected to appear in court in Israel later this week after nine months in detention without being charged.Mohammed Ibrahim, who is 16 and lives in Florida, was arrested in February while on holiday in the Israeli-occupied West Bank for allegedly throwing stones at Jewish settlers, something he denies.Last month, 27 Democratic US Senators and House members sent a letter to the US State Department, urging the Trump administration to do more to pressure Israel to release him.In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Mohammed had committed a \"a serious potentially deadly crime\" and that the court was proceeding under due process.The teenager's family disagrees.\"You can ask anybody you know, he's a real sweet boy, into his sports and his PlayStation and school,\" his father, Zahar Ibrahim, tells me before wiping a tear from his eye.Mohammed was arrested in a raid on his family's holiday home in the Palestinian village of al-Mazraa al-Sharqiya in the middle of the night by Israeli soldiers. He was 15 years old at the time.Mr Ibrahim has not seen or spoken to Mohammed since February.\"He's just a regular fun kid that loves and respects anybody,\" Mr Ibrahim tells me from the holiday home.Unable to speak to his son for nine months, Mr Ibrahim has only heard accounts of his detention through court documents and says his son was forced to confess.According to the court documents, he says, Mohammed woke up surrounded by Israeli soldiers. \"They tied him up and blindfolded him, and they threw him on the floor of the jeep and took him to wherever they took him.\"Mr Ibrahim, a father of four who runs an ice cream business in Florida, says his son only confessed to throwing stones because the soldiers beat him.The Israeli prime minister's office has not responded to a request for comment on whether Mohammed is being held without charge or the allegation that he was beaten while in detention.The US embassy assigned a case worker who has visited Mohammed in prison. Mr Ibrahim says they told him he had lost a lot of weight and was not doing well.He has a message for President Donald Trump, another Florida resident.\"Do what you said from day one. You know America first. He's American, and he's a citizen and he's a child. So, you know, as a president, his [Trump's] duty is to protect Americans, and we're not seeing that for Mohammed.\"\"What's lucky about an American passport?\" Mr Ibrahim says. \"It's not helping. That's one thing that usually a foreign passport makes a difference, but the US state department is not really doing anything.\"A state department spokesperson told the BBC that it was \"tracking Mr Ibrahim's case closely and working with the government of Israel on this case\".US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee and embassy staff in Jerusalem were also \"deeply involved\", they said, before adding that they could not comment further \"due to privacy and other considerations\".Zaher IbrahimMohammed is accused of throwing stones at Israeli settlers - something he deniesBecause Mohammed is an American citizen who was only on holiday in the West Bank when he was arrested, his case has attracted the attention of US lawmakers.\"This is a case where the US does have influence. It's just failing to exercise its influence, and that's a great dereliction of duty,\" says Democratic US Senator, Chris van Hollen, from his office in Washington DC.Along with 26 other US lawmakers he has written a letter to the state department and President Trump demanding more to be done to release Mohammed.\"If this were any other country, you would be seeing a much bigger effort. But for whatever reason, the Trump administration does not want to push the Netanyahu government to do what it needs to do,\" Van Hollen tells us.\"You have an American citizen who is being terribly mistreated, who has been beaten up, who has been deprived of adequate food and nutrition, and I haven't heard much from the US government. I haven't heard anything from the secretary of state. I mean, Donald Trump himself. I mean, who says that he is the 'America First' president?\"Mohammed is being held without charge at Ofer prison in the West Bank. It also houses adult detainees, including some who have been convicted of the most serious terrorist offences including murder.Mohammed's case has become relatively high profile because he is an American citizen.But there are around 350 Palestinian child security detainees being held in Israeli jails, according to the Israeli Prison Service.Many have never been charged and human rights groups, as well as the United Nations, say some have suffered abuse and torture.\"We should be demanding justice,\" says Van Hollen.As I leave Zahar Ibrahim's holiday home in al-Mazraa al-Sharqiya, he looks drained and alone. The house is sparse. Just a set of weights to fill his time.All he can do is wait.",

The cause is not yet known. \"It's a disaster,\" Thomas said of the fire, telling the BBC he had seen a body being taken away. \"Many people sent us WhatsApp messages or called us, saying they still have relatives inside or can't find them,\" Mui Siu-fung, a councillor for the Tai Po district, told BBC Chinese. More than a thousand other people were forced to evacuate the estate as the flames spread, with some heading to centres that have been set up to house them. Police also moved people from nearby buildings. The fire is gradually being contained but officials say they do not know when it will be fully extinguished. Flames could be seen coming from individual apartments as many people watched on in silence.One woman said her friends live inside the building and she was waiting to hear if they managed to get out.ReutersHarry Cheung has lived in block two of the Wang Fuk Court complex for decadesHarry Cheung, who has lived in block two of the Wang Fuk Court complex for more than 40 years, told Reuters he heard \"a very loud noise\" and saw fire erupt in a nearby block.\"I immediately went back to pack up my things,\" the 66-year-old resident said.\"I don't even know how I feel right now. I'm just thinking about where I'm going to sleep tonight because I probably won't be able to go back home.\"A woman in her sixties, whose surname is Kam and who lives in the adjacent Kwong Fuk Estate, told the South China Morning Post (SCMP) that several of her friends living in Wang Fuk Court have been accounted for - but not all.One friend has daily afternoon naps and may have been sleeping when the fire broke out at 14:51 local time (06:51 GMT), Ms Kam said, adding that the woman's daughters have not yet been able to contact her. Another resident, 65-year-old Jason Kong, told Reuters that a neighbour called him and said he was still trapped inside one of the tower blocks. \"I am devastated. There are so many neighbours and friends. I do not know what is going on anymore. Look, all the apartments are just burning. I do not know what to do. I hope the government can help us to settle down after this.\"An elderly woman who lives in one of the affected blocks told the BBC she was not at home when the fire broke out but that she is worried about her apartment because it is not insured. \"I'm very upset that I have no home to go to now,\" she said. While the cause of the fire that engulfed the multiple high-rise blocks is unknown, the flames are believed to have spread quickly through the bamboo scaffolding that covered the buildings, which were undergoing renovations.Some people have expressed anger that such a massive fire could have happened and criticised the response.\"When there's a wildfire, they will deploy helicopters and drop water bombs, but why is there no such deployment and how can they leave other buildings burning?\" Ms Poon, another resident of Wang Fuk Court, who is in her sixties, asked.\"The community is so close to the fire station and we thought the fire could be put out soon, but now the fire has spread. I'm so disappointed,\" she told the SCMP. Ms Poon noted that she had been given no instructions from the government on where to seek help.The BBC spoke to some Tai Po residents who had brought supplies to the victims and affected residents - including dozens of blankets and heat packs.Hong Kong chief executive John Lee said government departments were assisting residents affected by the fire.When asked about their feelings about the fire, the residents said \"the government is incompetent\" and that they were \"immensely heartbroken\".  \"We don't want to see any more casualties,\" said one.

    "body": "12 minutes agoNicolas Negoce,Paul Njie,BBC Africa reportersandWedaeli ChibelushiAFP via Getty ImagesThe soldiers gave an address on state TVA group of military officers say they have seized control of Guinea-Bissau amid reports that the president, Umaro Sissoco Embaló, has been arrested.Shortly after gunshots were heard in the capital, Bissau, government sources told the BBC that Embaló had been detained.The officers then appeared on state TV, saying they had suspended the electoral process, as the West African nation awaited the outcome of Sunday's presidential election. They said they were acting to thwart a plot by unnamed politicians who had \"the support of a well-known drug baron\" to destabilise the country, and announced the closure of its borders and imposed a night-time curfew.Sandwiched between Senegal and Guinea, the coup-prone country is  known as a notorious drug-trafficking hub where the military has been influential since independence from Portugal in 1974.The election results were expected on Thursday - both Embaló and his closest rival Fernando Dias had claimed victory.Dias was supported by former Prime Minister Domingos Pereira, who had been disqualified from running.Late on Wednesday afternoon, Embaló told France 24 in a phone call: \"I have been deposed.\"Government sources have since told the BBC that Dias, Pereira and Interior Minister Botché Candé have also been detained.The putschists have taken army chief Gen Biague Na Ntan and his deputy, Gen Mamadou Touré, into custody too, the sources say.Witnesses in Bissau heard gunfire earlier on, at around 13:00 GMT, but it was not immediately clear who was involved in the shooting or if there were any casualties.Hundreds of people on foot and in vehicles fled, seeking shelter as the shots rang out, the AFP news agency reported.Later on, General Denis N'Canha, head of the military household at the presidential palace, read out a statement declaring a takeover.He said officers had formed \"the High Military Command for the Restoration of Order\" and instructed the population to \"remain calm\".Corbis via Getty ImagesPresident Embaló was elected in December 2019Checkpoints have been erected across Bissau and the streets were deserted ahead of the curfew, that was due to start at 19:00 GMT.Portugal has called for a return to constitutional order, with its foreign ministry urging \"all those involved to refrain from any act of institutional or civic violence\".The former Portuguese colony has witnessed nine coups or attempted coups over the last five decades.Embaló has said he has survived multiple coup attempts during his time in office. However, his critics allege he has fabricated crises in order to crack down on dissent.He is the only elected president in the country's history to complete a full term in office.The 53-year-old  had initially said he would not seek a second term. Prior to the delayed polls, his legitimacy had been questioned, with the opposition saying his term should have officially ended in February 2025.Guinea-Bissau is one of the poorest countries in the world with a population of just under two million people.Its coastline has many uninhabited islands, making it ideal for drugs traffickers - with the UN dubbing it a \"narco-state\" as it has been a key transit point for cocaine coming from Latin America en route to Europe.

    "body": "1 day agoLisa LambertPA MediaUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shakes hands with Dan Driscoll in KyivWhen talks to end the Russia-Ukraine war took an unexpected turn last week, with the leak of a peace plan said to come from the US, the Trump administration dispatched an unlikely figure to attend a flurry of overseas meetings. The youngest-ever army secretary, 39-year-old Dan Driscoll, is often referred to as President Donald Trump's \"drone guy\" for his embrace of emerging battlefield technologies. Until recently, he was mostly known for discussions of budgets, supplies and staff issues in the military's largest branch. Driscoll does not appear to have a long history of dealing with Russia and Ukraine, or experience in international diplomacy, and has never held public office.So, who is this increasingly prominent figure within the administration?Close ally of Vice-President JD VanceIt is Driscoll's relationship with the now-vice president, JD Vance, that brought him into Trump's orbit.Like his friend Vance, Driscoll attended a public university before joining the US Army, and then earned his law degree at the prestigious Yale University. Both men also worked in finance after graduating. During his military career, Driscoll became an officer in 2007, led a cavalry platoon and deployed to Iraq for several months in 2009. He has told the story of meeting Vance through a veterans' student group at law school, during which Vance reassured new students that they would at first feel as if they did not belong, but would excel at classes after a few months. Soon, Vance became Driscoll's friend and mentor.Driscoll was on holiday with his family in Switzerland in the summer of 2024 when Vance called to tell him he was going to be Trump's running mate and asked him to join the campaign.The next day, Driscoll flew back to the US, bought a suit at an outlet mall, and took an Uber to the Republican National Convention, he told the alumni magazine for the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill - the institution where he was an undergraduate.Once Trump returned to office, Driscoll was swiftly approved as army secretary in his Senate confirmation vote. His sphere of influence expanded after he became a key figure in Trump's deployment of the National Guard to US cities. Afterwards, he also took over the role of acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.Getty ImagesDriscoll at his confirmation hearing in JanuaryUnannounced visit to UkraineDriscoll has often spoken about the war in Ukraine - pointing to Ukrainian drones as a relatively cheap, mass-produced technology that is good for fighting. But after being nominated for the army secretary job, he did not initially appear to be involved in negotiations to end the war. Trump was instead relying on his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, to work on a plan for a ceasefire. When details of a 28-point plan drafted by the US and Russia were leaked last week, Ukraine immediately voiced concern at some of its key points - and its European allies followed suit. Driscoll then made an unannounced visit to Ukraine along with other high-ranking Pentagon figures, the most senior military group to travel to Kyiv since Trump took office in January. The purpose, according to a US Army spokesman, was to meet Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war.Driscoll met Zelensky and was then, according to Politico, feted at a reception at the US ambassador's residence.In subsequent days, Driscoll participated in more discussions with Ukrainian officials in Geneva alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and helped draw up an \"updated and refined peace framework\". He went on to hold talks with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi, according to the BBC's US partner, CBS News.In a social media post on Tuesday, Trump said in an effort to finalise the peace plan, he had directed his envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. He said Driscoll would meet with the Ukrainian side.A future envoy... or defence secretary?Getty ImagesDriscoll with National Guard troops in WashingtonIn nominating Driscoll as his army secretary, Trump wrote he had a \"powerful combination of experiences to serve as a disruptor and change agent\".Some in Washington are wondering if those qualities and his recent appearance on the world stage mean that Driscoll could one day replace Pete Hegseth, if Hegseth ever steps down as defence secretary.While he has never held public office, Driscoll worked in Congress as an intern for the Senate's veteran affairs committee, and in 2020 he made an unsuccessful bid for a House seat in North Carolina. A former professor has suggested Driscoll aimed \"to serve in the military, go to law school and be in politics\".There is also the possibility Driscoll could step officially into the role of negotiating with Ukraine when Trump's special envoy to the country, Keith Kellogg, leaves in January. Or he could stay as the head of hundreds of thousands of troops in the US Army. Driscoll has previously highlighted that his father and grandfather served in the military before him, and he often speaks about his vision of transforming the Army. Days before heading to Ukraine, Driscoll described to The Conversation podcast how he imagined the near future, when \"every infantryman...will carry a drone into battle\" and soldiers would rely on artificial intelligence because human brains will not be able to \"keep up\" with the pace of action. \"Our window to change is right now,\" he said in a speech in October. \"And we will win with silicon and software, not our soldiers' blood and bodies.\"",

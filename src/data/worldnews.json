    "body": "2 days agoYolande KnellMiddle East correspondent, JerusalemBBCItzik Gvili demands the return of his son Ran, the last dead hostage in Gaza, in Tel Aviv's Hostages SquareIn central Tel Aviv, the main stage has now been dismantled in Hostages Square, the focal point for the campaign over the past two years to bring back Israelis held in Gaza.Nearby, signs and posters have been taken down, and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum has vacated the offices that served as its nerve centre. Of the 251 hostages seized by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in the 7 October 2023 attacks, 168 have been brought back alive from Gaza, eight have been rescued. Only one deceased hostage, Ran Gvili, remains.With songs and prayers instead of mass rallies, the Gvili family and a small crowd of supporters assemble in Hostages Square each Friday to mark the start of the Jewish Sabbath; this week, a candle for the Hanukkah holiday was also lit. They are determined to bring back the young police officer who was killed by Hamas fighters after he rushed to help people being attacked in Kibbutz Alumim in southern Israel in October 2023.\"I feel every day is still the 7 October. We didn't pass the 7 October, but we are strong, and we're waiting for him. We do whatever we need,\" says Itzik Gvili, Ran's father. \"This gives us hope: the support of the people.\"ReutersThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum's slogan is: \"Bring them home now\"From the start, people power has been key to the hostage families. As its operations wind down, members of the Hostages Families Forum have been reflecting on its extraordinary evolution which turned the grassroots group into a powerful international lobbying force.In the terrible aftermath of the 2023 Hamas-led assault on southern Israel, which also killed some 1,200 people, a huge group of distraught relatives gathered for the first time in Tel Aviv desperately seeking answers about their missing loved ones. Because of the incoming rocket fire from Gaza, they met in an underground car park.\"We were together, shocked, and it fell on me that this is actually real, that now we are going to face this unbelievable challenge of understanding where all these people are, getting them home,\" recalls Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat had been snatched from Kibbutz Be'eri.\"And the second thing is that we're going to do this together. I'm not going to stand alone.\"ReutersGil Dickmann (2nd R) said the public support gave him hope after kidnapping of his cousin, Carmel GatThe formation of the new forum, with its slogan: \"Bring them home now\", gave the hostages' families a much-needed sense of regaining control.\"It was very, very powerful to feel that when the government and Israeli state, in a way collapsed in those very first few days after 7 October, it felt like nothing was working, what was working was Israeli society,\" Mr Dickmann says. \"So many wonderful people came to help. That brought me a lot of hope.\"Dividing its efforts between supporting the families - many of whom were bereaved and displaced from their homes following the attacks - and campaigning in Israel and around the world, the Hostages Families Forum worked with more than 10,000 volunteers. They included former Israeli diplomats, lawyers and security officials.Funded entirely by donations, it began to pay some staff, and a high-tech company loaned its central Tel Aviv office space.ReutersA makeshift tunnel symbolizing Hamas's tunnel network in Gaza was constructed at Hostages Square In November 2023 - more than six weeks into the brutal war in Gaza, which had by then killed more than 14,000 Palestinians according to the Hamas-run health ministry - Israel and Hamas agreed to a Qatar-mediated truce.This saw most women and children hostages returned in exchange for Israel releasing more than 240 Palestinian prisoners, all women and children. Hamas also freed some foreign nationals.But after a week, the fighting resumed with ferocity. About half of the hostages were left in Gaza. In December, three Israeli hostages were killed by Israeli soldiers in Gaza despite the fact they were shirtless, waving a makeshift white flag, and calling out in Hebrew.Israeli Prime Minister's Office/handout via ReutersItay Regev and his sister Maya were released during the November 2023 ceasefireThose were difficult days for the Hostages Families Forum and in early 2024, with polls suggesting more Israelis prioritised eliminating Hamas over the return of those still held captive, it brought in political strategist, Lior Chorev, as campaign manager.\"We were in deep war in Gaza, deep war in Lebanon, there was the Iranian threat, and it appeared that everything was stuck, and public opinion was against us,\" Mr Chorev explains.\"As a civil society organisation, we could not impact whether or not there's going to be a deal, but we could work hard on the Israeli public opinion to ensure that if a deal came into place, it would have a sound civilian majority within the country.\"ReutersGaza has been devastated by the two-year war sparked by 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attacks on IsraelAs well as Saturday evening demonstrations in the plaza in front of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, now renamed Hostages Square, there were near-daily actions by the Hostages Families Forum ranging from concerts and art installations to civil disruption. Media and diplomatic teams helped keep the hostages at the centre of attention.\"They kept going 24/7 for two years,\" comments Times of Israel political correspondent Tal Schneider who, like visiting foreign officials, often went to the forum's HQ. \"This place became like a foreign ministry for the country, for the families of 250 people.\"Looking back, Michael Levy says his intensive campaigning helped him deal with the \"emotional rollercoaster\" after his sister-in-law, Einav, was killed at the Nova Festival and his younger brother, Or, was taken hostage alive.\"The only thing that helped me was becoming active. I was interviewed all the time. I went with 15 different delegations to over 12 countries. I spoke to whoever was willing to listen and didn't want to stop and think,\" Mr Levy says.\"You need to stay optimistic all the time. You need to tell yourself every morning that today is going to be the day that he's going to be released, even though you know you are lying to yourself.\"ReutersMichael Levy's brother, Or, was released during the ceasefire that lasted from January to March 2025Although a hostage-prisoner exchange deal to end the war laid out in mid-2024 was described by then-US President Joe Biden as an Israeli proposal, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was widely seen as dragging out hostilities to aid his own political survival – a claim he rejected.Tensions rose between the Hostages Families Forum and Israel's government; there was open animosity from some government supporters.The situation worsened after a Netanyahu aide was accused of deliberately acquiring and illegally leaking a top-secret document to a German newspaper to influence how Israel's public viewed negotiations on a ceasefire and hostage deal. The document was misleadingly cast as suggesting that pressure on the prime minister played into the hands of Hamas.ReutersHundreds of people were killed or taken hostage at the Nova music festival during the 7 October 2023 attacksFor Mr Dickmann and Mr Levy, there was a low point when they headed to Washington for Netanyahu's address to a joint meeting of US Congress in July 2024 with other forum members.They showed off T-shirts saying \"Seal the deal\" during an ovation for the Israeli leader and were arrested for an unlawful demonstration. \"That was one of the moments in which I felt most alone,\" Mr Dickmann says. \"It was one of the most frightening things and it was while Carmel was still alive in captivity.\"The worst news came a month later when Carmel and five other hostages were killed by their Hamas captors, as the Israeli military closed in nearby.Mr Dickmann says it was only an \"unbelievable support group\" of younger forum members that helped him get through the ordeal.After the Israeli deaths were confirmed, angry protesters flooded the streets of Israeli cities. The forum puts the total number at 600,000.In Tel Aviv, a crowd of hostage families and their supporters marched with six prop coffins. A crowd gathered outside Israel's military headquarters and clashed with police on a major road.EPAThe killing of Carmel Gat and five other hostages by their Hamas captors sparked a huge protest in Tel AvivBy the start of 2025, international opposition to the devastating Gaza war had reached new heights as the number of Palestinians killed approached 48,000, according to Gaza's health ministry.In Israel, polls indicated a clear shift in Israeli public opinion, with a growing majority backing a hostage deal to end the war. With the election of a new US president, the Hostages Families Forum was increasingly directing its efforts stateside.\"They needed to bypass their own government,\" comments Ms Schneider.  \"The most important person for the job was obviously [US] President [Donald] Trump. There were signs written in English carried by the people and they would pack all their messages into a one-minute video, and they'd send it to him.\"Working with regional mediators, the US secured a new Gaza deal between Israel and Hamas in January 2025, just as Trump took office. The first stage brought back 33 hostages – eight of whom were dead – in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Five Thai hostages were also released.But in mid-March, Israel ended the ceasefire, resuming its heavy bombing of Gaza, without starting talks on the deal's second stage, which involved a full end to fighting and the return of the remaining hostages.The White HouseReleased hostages travelled to Washington to ask President Donald Trump to ensure the return of those left behind in GazaFrail and emaciated following his release in February under the ceasefire deal, Or Levy was emotionally reunited with his three-year-old son, his parents and brother Michael. However, Michael's joy was short-lived. He quickly resumed his campaigning with others in the Hostages Families Forum.\"I got what I wanted, I got my brother back, but I couldn't just stop,\" he says, \"I couldn't be happy because in those 491 days, they became my family. I almost felt I knew all the other hostages, that every hostage still there was part of my family.\"Newly freed hostages gave TV interviews saying they had been starved and beaten in captivity, sometimes in response to the ill-treatment of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Despite their trauma and fragile health, a few of the former hostages travelled to the White House urging President Trump to use his influence to bring back all the living and dead Israelis they had left behind in Gaza.ReutersEvyatar David was among the last 20 living hostages freed shortly after the current ceasefire began in OctoberThere were more dramatic moments.In September, an Israeli air strike unsuccessfully targeted the exiled Hamas leadership as it met in Qatar, a regional mediator, to discuss a new ceasefire proposal presented by the US.However, the ultimate effect was to push the Trump administration - backed up by its Arab allies – towards a new plan to end the war, which had by then killed more than 67,000 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry.Israel and Hamas agreed a ceasefire deal, under which all 20 living and 28 dead hostages still in Gaza would be handed over in return for almost 2,000 Palestinian detainees and prisoners in Israeli jails, as well as a surge in humanitarian aid and a partial Israeli withdrawal.ReutersIsrael released about 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees from Gaza in exchange for the living hostagesWhen Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, arrived in Israel just after the latest ceasefire started on 10 October, they were greeted by rapturous applause on stage in Hostages Square.On 13 October, the remaining living hostages came back.\"I'll never have a happier day in my life,\" says Mr Dickmann, remembering seeing his best friends reunited with their loved ones.Mr Chorev, the Hostage Families Forum's chief strategist, considers that long-held Jewish and Israeli traditions won through.\"This basic value of the Israeli theme that you don't leave anyone behind, that you're responsible for each and every Israeli held by the enemy, this was something that was unclear to certain elements in the Israeli government,\" he says. \"But it was very clear to the Israeli public.\"Tali (L) has been helping out hostages' families since the beginning of the warSlowly, 27 of the dead hostages' bodies have been returned to Israel over the past two months.Amid the ruins of Gaza, where health ministry officials say the number of Palestinians killed has risen to more than 70,000, Hamas operatives and the Red Cross have been searching for Ran Gvili's body east of Gaza City.Now, the last funds of the Hostages Families Forum are being used to support the Gvilis and a few dozen volunteers continue to head to Hostages Square on Fridays.\"We have been here in the rain and in nearly 50-degree [Celsius] heat, from winter to summer,\" says Tali, from Tel Aviv. \"Now that this is nearly over, I have mixed emotions. There is still one hostage who hasn't come back. I told myself I would stay until the last one.\"A symbolic tunnel, a large \"Hope\" sign and a piano put in the square in honour of now released hostage, Alon Ohel - a musician - have not yet been removed, nor has the giant countdown board which marks the days since 7 October 2023. A final mass rally is promised for when Ran Gvili's body is returned for burial.Itzik and Talik Gvili are determined to bring their son Ran home for a proper burial Israel's prime minister has never appeared in Hostages Square, but he has met with released hostages and hostage families, including those from a small, alternative group to the Hostages Families Forum, the Tikva Forum. The Gvilis belong to both.The family joined a candle-lighting ceremony on the first night of Hanukkah with Netanyahu.\"We will bring Ran back, just as we brought back 254 out of our 255 abductees,\" the prime minister said - counting two living and two deceased hostages held in Gaza before 2023.  \"Some did not believe. I believe. My friends in the government believed. They said: 'It will be a miracle.' I said: 'This nation performs miracles.'\"But in Israel, painful questions linger over why more hostages' lives were not saved.The Hostages Families Forum recently released harrowing Hamas videos recovered in Gaza which show the six hostages who were later murdered, including Carmel Gat, celebrating Hanukkah in a tunnel in 2023.The hostage crisis continues to cast a long shadow over Israeli society; even as many take heart from the families' message of endurance and solidarity.Additional reporting by Davide Ghiglione and Gidi Kleiman",

    "body": "2 days agoGrace Tsoi,BBC World ServiceandBBC News Chinese,Hong KongBBCJimmy Lai, 78, faces life in prison for national security offencesOn a winter morning in 2022 Raphael Wong and Figo Chan walked into Hong Kong's Stanley prison to meet Jimmy Lai, the media billionaire who had been arrested two years before and was awaiting trial charged with national security offences.They had all been part of the turbulent protests that had rocked Hong Kong in 2019, when hundreds of thousands took to the streets demanding democracy and more freedom in the Chinese territory. They would also often meet for dinner, sometimes lavish meals, gossiping and bantering over dim sum, pizza or claypot rice.In prison, he \"loved eating rice with pickled ginger,\" Chan said. \"No-one could have imagined Jimmy Lai would eat something like that!\"But neither had they imagined a reunion at a maximum security prison, the protests crushed, friends and fellow activists jailed, Hong Kong just as boisterous and yet, changed. And gone was the owner of the irreverent nickname \"Fatty Lai\": he had lost considerable weight.Decades apart - Lai in his 70s, Wong and Chan about 40 years younger - they had still dreamed of a different Hong Kong. Lai was a key figure in the protests, wielding his most influential asset, the hugely popular newspaper, Apple Daily, in the hope of shaping Hong Kong into a liberal democracy. That proved risky under a contentious national security law imposed in 2020 by China's Communist Party rulers in Beijing.Lai always said he owed Hong Kong. Although he is a UK citizen, he refused to leave. \"I got everything I have because of this place,\" he told the BBC hours before he was arrested in 2020. \"This is my redemption,\" he said, choking up.He wanted the city to continue to have the freedom it had given him. That's what drove his politics - fiercely critical of the Communist Party and avowedly supportive of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. It cost him his own freedom.Watch: Jimmy Lai's last interview as a free man in 2020Lai harboured \"a rabid hatred\" of the Chinese Communist Party and \"an obsession to change the Party's values to those of the Western world\", the High Court ruled on Monday as it delivered the verdict in his trial. It said that Lai had hoped the party would be ousted - or, at the very least, that its leader Xi Jinping would be removed.Lai was found guilty on all counts of charges he had always denied. The most serious one - colluding with foreign forces - carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.\"Never,\" Lai had said to that charge when he testified, arguing that he had only advocated for what he believed were Hong Kong's values: \"rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly\".Monday's verdict was welcomed by Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee, who said Lai had used his newspaper to \"wantonly create social conflicts\" and \"glorify violence\". The law, he added, never allows anyone to harm the country \"under the guise of human rights, democracy and freedom\".Getty ImagesLai's wife Teresa and son Shun-yan at court for Lai's verdict, along with Cardinal Joseph Zen, former bishop of Hong Kong who baptised Lai in 1997 Back in 2022, before Wong and Chan left the prison, Lai asked them to pray with him, to Wong's surprise.Lai's Catholic faith had deepened in solitary confinement - an arrangement he had requested, according to authorities. He prayed six hours a day and he made drawings of Christ, which he sent in the mail to friends. \"Even though he was suffering,\" Wong said, \"he didn't complain nor was he afraid. He was at peace.\"Peace was not what Jimmy Lai had pursued for much of his life - not when he fled China as a 12-year-old, not while he worked his way up the gruelling factory chain, not even after he became a famous Hong Kong tycoon, and certainly not as his media empire took on Beijing.For Lai, Hong Kong was everything that China was not - deeply capitalist, a land of opportunity and limitless wealth, and free. In the city, which was still a British colony when he arrived in 1959, he found success - and then a voice.Apple Daily became one of the top-selling papers almost instantly after its debut in 1995. Modelled on USA Today, it revolutionised the aesthetics and layout of newspapers, and kicked off a cut-throat price war.From a guide to hiring prostitutes in the \"adult section\" to investigative reports, to columns by economists and novelists, it was a \"buffet\" targeting \"a full range of readers\", said Francis Lee, a journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Former editors and employees spoke of Lai's encouragement - \"If you dared to do it, he would dare to let you do it\" - and his temper. One said he often swore.They describe him as unconventional, and as a visionary who wasn't afraid to bet on experiments. \"Even before the iPhone was launched, he kept saying mobile phones would be the future,\" recalled one of the paper's editors, adding that he was full of ideas. \"It was as if he asked us to create a new website every day.\"It had been the same when he owned a clothing label. \"He was not afraid of disrupting the industry, and he was not afraid of making enemies,\" said Herbert Chow, a former marketing director at a rival brand.That was both his making and undoing, Chow said: \"Otherwise, there would have been no Apple Daily. Of course, he wouldn't have ended up like this either.\"An early TV commercial for Apple Daily featured the then 48-year-old Lai biting the forbidden fruit while dozens of arrows took aim at him.It became a self-fulfilling prophecy.Jimmylai.substack.comThe Apple Daily commercial when it launched in 1995Escape from ChinaIt was his first taste of chocolate that beckoned Lai to Hong Kong as a boy.After carrying a passenger's luggage at a railway station in China, Lai was given a tip, and a bar of chocolate. He took a bite. \"I asked him where he's from. He said Hong Kong. I said, 'Hong Kong must be heaven' because I had never tasted anything like that,\" Lai said of the encounter in a 2007 documentary, The Call of the Entrepreneur.Life in Mao Zedong's China was punctuated by waves of oppressive campaigns - to industrialise China overnight, to weed out capitalist \"class enemies\". The Lais, once a family of business people, were blacklisted. His father fled to Hong Kong, leaving them behind. His mother was sent to a labour camp.Decades later, Lai wrote of how of he and his sisters would be dragged out of their homes to watch a crowd forcing their mother to kneel while she was shoved and taunted - cruel public shaming that soon became the norm. The first time, Lai wrote, was terrifying: \"My tears flowed freely and wet my shirt. I dared not make a move. My body was burning with humiliation.\"Uncowed, his grandmother finished every story with the same message: \"You have to become a businessman even if you only sell seasoned peanuts!\"And so, at the age of 12, he set off for Hong Kong, among millions who fled the mainland - and Mao's devastating rule - over the years.The day he arrived, on the bottom of a fishing boat, along with about 80 seasick travellers, he was hired by a mitten factory. He described the long working hours as a \"very happy time, a time that I knew I had a future\". It was there that one of his co-workers helped him learn English. Years later, he would give interviews and even testify at court in fluent English.By his early 20s, he was managing a textile factory and after making money on the stock market, he started his own, Comitex Knitters. He was 27.Getty ImagesJimmy Lai at his home in Hong Kong in 1993 Business often took Lai to New York, and on one of those trips, he was lent a book that came to define his worldview: The Road to Serfdom by Nobel Prize-winning economist Friedrich Hayek, a champion of free-market capitalism. \"People's spontaneous reaction\" and \"the exchange of information\" have created the best in the world, was his takeaway. To him, that was Hong Kong's strength.The book spurred a voracious reading habit. He would read the same book multiple times, and read every book by authors he admired.  \"I want to turn the author's thoughts into my backyard garden. I want to buy a garden, not cut flowers,\" he said in a 2009 interview.After a decade in manufacturing, he was \"bored\" and founded the clothing chain Giordano in 1981, which became a fast-fashion pioneer. It was so successful that Tadashi Yanai sought advice from Lai when his Japanese label Uniqlo opened shops.Lai launched stores in China, which had begun to open up after Mao died. He was \"excited\", China \"was going to be changed, like a Western country\", he said in the 2007 documentary.Then in 1989, Beijing crushed pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square: a rude awakening for Lai and Hong Kong, which was set to return to Chinese rule in 1997 under a recent agreement by China and the UK.Giordano sold tees with photos of Tiananmen protest leaders and anti-Beijing slogans, and put up pro-democracy banners in stores across Hong Kong.A million people marched in Hong Kong in solidarity with student protesters in Beijing. Until 2020, Hong Kong held the largest vigil that mourned the massacre.Lai said later that he \"didn't feel anything about China\" until then. He had always wanted to forget that part of his life but \"all of a sudden, it was like my mother was calling in the darkness of the night\".Getty ImagesLai was a frequent attendee at Hong Kong 's annual vigils in memory of those who died at Tiananmen Square in 1989'Choice is freedom'The following year Lai launched a magazine called Next, and in 1994 published an open letter to Li Peng, \"the Butcher of Beijing\" who played a key role in the Tiananmen massacre. He called him \"the son of a turtle egg with zero intelligence\".Beijing was furious. Between 1994 and 1996, Giordano's flagship store in Beijing and 11 franchises in Shanghai closed. Lai sold his shares and stepped down as chairman.\"If I just go on making money, it doesn't mean anything to me. But if I go into the media business, then I deliver information, which is choice, and choice is freedom,\" Lai said in the 2007 documentary.He soon became a \"very active participant\" in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, meeting leaders to discuss strategy, said Lee Wing Tat, a former lawmaker from the Democratic Party.He became an outspoken critic of the CCP, writing in 1994: \"I entirely oppose the Communist Party because I hate everything that restrains personal liberties.\" He also started to voice concerns about the looming handover of Hong Kong, from Britain to China, in 1997. \"After more than a century of colonial rule, Hong Kongers feel proud to return to the embrace of the motherland,\" he wrote. \"But should we love the motherland even if it doesn't have freedom?\"During the handover, however, China's then-leader Jiang Zemin promised that Hongkongers would govern Hong Kong and the city would have a high degree of autonomy for the next 50 years.Getty ImagesLai at an \"Occupy Central\" protest in Admiralty in October 2014The 2014 Umbrella Movement sparked by Beijing's refusal to allow completely free elections in Hong Kong became another turning point for Lai.Protesters occupied the city's main commercial districts for 79 days. Lai turned up from 9am to 5pm every day, undeterred after a man threw animal entrails at him. \"When the police started firing tear gas, I was with Fatty,\" the former lawmaker Lee recalled.The movement ended when the court ordered protest sites to be cleared, but the government did not budge. Five years later, in 2019, Hong Kong erupted again, this time because of a controversial plan that would have allowed extradition to mainland China.What began as peaceful marches became increasingly violent, turning the city into a battleground for six months. Black-clad protesters threw bricks and Molotov cocktails, stormed parliament and started fires; riot police fired tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons and live rounds.Lai was at the forefront of the protests and served 20 months for participating in four unauthorised assemblies. A protester told the BBC he was surprised to see Lai: \"To me, he's a busy businessman, but he showed up.\"Getty ImagesLai at a pro-democracy march in 2019 Apple Daily provided blanket coverage or, as critics would argue, a sounding board for an anti-government movement.Government adviser Ronny Tong said Lai was \"instrumental\" in the protests because Apple Daily carried a \"totally false\" slogan – anti-extradition to China – which \"caught the imagination of people who wanted to cause havoc in Hong Kong\".Whether Apple Daily played a seditious role, and how much control Lai exerted over its stance was at the centre of his 156-day national security trial.Lai instructed the editorial team to \"urge people to take to the streets\", according to Cheung Kim-hung, former chief executive of Apple Daily's parent company Next Digital, and a defendant-turned-prosecution witness. After the National Security Law took effect, the newspaper was raided twice and eventually shut down in 2021.During the height of the protests, Lai flew to the US where he met then Vice-President Mike Pence to discuss the situation in Hong Kong. A month before the National Security Law was imposed, Lai launched a controversial campaign, despite internal pushback, urging Apple Daily readers to send letters to then US President Donald Trump to \"save Hong Kong\".All of this, the court ruled, amounted to a public appeal for a foreign government to interfere in Hong Kong's internal affairs.\"Nobody in their right mind should think that Hong Kong can undergo any kind of political reform without at least tacit acceptance from Beijing,\" Tong said. The protests in 2014 and 2019 \"are totally against common sense\".Getty ImagesCopies of the last Apple Daily newspaper early on June 24, 2021Beijing says Hong Kong has now moved from \"chaos to governance\" and onto \"greater prosperity\" because of the national security law and a \"patriot-only\" parliament. But critics, including hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers who have since left, say dissent has been stifled, and the city's freedoms severely curbed.Lee, the lawmaker, is among them: \"When I first came to the UK, I had nightmares. I felt very guilty. Why could we live in other places freely, while our good friends were jailed?\"Lai's family has been calling for his release for years, citing concerns for his health because he is diabetic, but their calls have been rejected so far. The government and Lai's Hong Kong legal team have said that his medical needs are being met.Carmen Tsang, Lai's daughter-in-law who lives in Hong Kong with her family, says her children miss grandpa - and the big family dinners he hosted every two weeks. His loud voice scared her daughter when she was younger, but \"they loved going to grandpa's place… They think he's a funny guy\".She is not sure today's Hong Kong has a place for Lai. \"If there's a speck of dust in your eye, you just get rid of it, right?\"Watch: What does the Jimmy Lai verdict mean for democracy in Hong Kong?",

    "body": "10 hours agoEmily AtkinsonGetty ImagesA senior staff member at France's presidential palace will stand trial over the alleged theft of precious tableware, including Baccarat Champagne glasses and Sèvres porcelain plates. Around 100 objects that were reported missing from the presidential collection were allegedly later found in the locker, car and home of Thomas M, who is reported to be the Élysée Palace's chief butler. He will stand trial alongside two others. Investigators say they found some of the items - thought to be worth between €15,000 and €40,000 (£13,000 and £35,000) - on his Vinted account. It comes just months after the Louvre Museum in Paris suffered a brazen heist in which jewels worth €88m (£76m) were taken. French media reported that Thomas M's role as head butler and keeper of precious silver involved setting the tables at state dinners and other prestigious events.He is accused of siphoning off the items over several months and falsifying the records to cover his tracks.Also among the alleged stolen goods are solid silver cutlery and a René Lalique figurine.The inventory kept by Thomas M suggested he was planning to steal more goods, prosecutors say.The Élysée has already posted a job advertisement to find his replacement, according to French media outlet TF1 Info. Officials at Sèvres - France's state-owned porcelain factory - also identified some of their items on online auction sites, including a plate embossed with an air force stamp and ashtrays.Thomas M was arrested on Tuesday 16 December on suspicion of theft, alongside his partner Damien G - a collector and manager of an online auction company.A third man, Ghislain M, was arrested a day later, accused of receiving stolen goods. His \"passion\" for rare antiques has been put forward by his lawyer as being behind his alleged involvement.According to Le Parisien - which first reported on the case - he was working as a guard at the Louvre at the time and has been barred from returning until the trial is completed.The trial is scheduled for February.More on this story",

    "body": "10 hours agoAlex BoydandLaura GozziBBC Russia Editor Steve Rosenberg on scene of Moscow car bombingA Russian general has been killed in a car bombing in Moscow, officials have said.Russia's Investigative Committee said Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov died on Monday morning after an explosive device planted under a car detonated.He is the third military official to have been killed in bomb attacks in the Russian capital over the last year.Sarvarov, 56, was the head of the armed forces' operational training department, the committee said.It added one theory being investigated was that the bomb was planted with the involvement of Ukrainian intelligence services. Ukraine has not commented.Sarvarov died in hospital as a result of his injuries, the committee said, adding it had opened an investigation into murder and illegal trafficking of explosives.Investigators have been sent to the scene, in a car park near an apartment block in the south of Moscow.Images from the area show a badly damaged white Kia Sorento with the doors blown out, surrounded by other vehicles. According to Russian media, Sarvarov previously took part in combat operations during the Ossetian-Ingush conflict and the Chechen wars in the 1990s and early 2000s, and also led operations in Syria between 2015-2016. ReutersInvestigators could be seen working at the scene on Monday morningVladimir Putin was informed of Sarvarov's death immediately, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a number of military officials and high-profile individuals have been targeted in the Russian capital.Darya Dugina, the 29-year-old daughter of a prominent nationalist figure and Putin close ally, was killed in a suspected car bombing in 2022.Gen Yaroslav Moskalik was killed in a car bomb attack last April, while Gen Igor Kirillov died in December 2024 when a device hidden in a scooter was detonated remotely.A Ukrainian source later told the BBC that Kirillov was killed by Ukraine's security service, though this was never confirmed on the record. As a matter of policy, Ukraine never officially admits or claims responsibility for targeted attacks.",

    "body": "Ecuadorean soldiers jailed for 34 years over boys' forced disappearance7 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterJONATHAN MIRANDA/EPA/ShutterstockEleven Ecuadorean soldiers have been sentenced to 34 years in prison each after being found guilty of the forced disappearance of four boys last year.The discovery of the beaten and burned remains of the four boys, aged between 11 and 15, shocked the violence-wracked nation.The court found a military patrol had picked up the boys as they returned from playing football in the city of Guayaquil, forced them to strip off their clothes, beat them and left them naked in a desolate, dangerous and abandoned location.One of the boys called his father but, by the time he arrived, they were no longer there. Their burned bodies were found days later close to a military base near Guayaquil. In total, 17 soldiers were on trial over the disappearance of 15-year-old Nehemías Arboleda, 11-year-old Steven Medina, and brothers Ismael, 15, and Josué Arroyo, 14.Eleven of the soldiers were sentenced to 34 years and eight months in prison and five were given reduced sentences of two and a half years for co-operating with the prosecution.A lieutenant-colonel who had not been on patrol with the rest of the group was declared not guilty. The soldiers had been sent on patrol as part of the government's crackdown on criminal gangs in the country, which has seen its crime rate skyrocket as the gangs' power has expanded. Defence officials had originally said that the four children, who became known as The Malvinas Four after the neighbourhood the were from, had been stopped by the patrol because they were suspects in a robbery.But the judge ruled that they had been \"innocent victims of a state crime\" and ordered that their families be issued with an official apology and that the four victims be commemorated with a plaque.He also ordered that military personnel undergo human rights training.The judge said that evidence provided by the five soldiers who had co-operated with the prosecution had revealed the cruelty with which the 16 soldiers on patrol had acted. He said that they had deliberately taken the four boys to a desolate area, where they subjected them to racist insults, beatings and even a simulated execution.Defence lawyers had argued that because the boys were alive when the soldiers left, the accused were not responsible for their death.But the judge concluded that leaving them in such a dangerous and desolate location \"was the cause of the victims' death\". It is not known who burned the bodies.",

    "body": "Spain's Christmas lottery has been welcomed as an \"injection of hope\" in the northwest of the country, where the jackpot handed out hundreds of millions of euros just months after wildfires had caused devastation.Most of the first-prize-winning tickets in the lottery, known as El Gordo, had been bought by people in small towns in the province of León. A single ticket, or décimo, costing €20 (£17), is worth €400,000 (£349,484) if it bears the winning number, in this case 79432. Décimos come in strips of 10 and when many strips of the same number are sold to a group of neighbours or workmates, there is potential for a massive jackpot.People in the town of La Bañeza shared out €468m (£409m). Among the recipients were members of a local football club in the town, which has a population of around 11,000.The jackpot came four months after forest fires had torn through León, burning 8,000 hectares (31 sq miles) of land surrounding La Bañeza and killing a local man, 35-year-old Abel Ramos. The sparsely populated, heavily forested north-west of Spain is used to wildfires, although during this record-breaking year, the area was particularly severely affected. Firefighters battled enormous blazes in León and the neighbouring Galicia region throughout much of August and during the summer 0.8 percent of the country's total surface area was burned.According to the mayor of the town, Javier Carrera, the lottery win \"means for La Bañeza an injection of excitement and hope,\" he told Spanish media. Carrera also mentioned the closure this year of a local sugar-beet factory which caused the loss of dozens of jobs.Another town in the León province that was heavily affected by the summer's fires, Villablino, also took a massive share of the jackpot, receiving €200 million (£175m).\"We needed some good news,\" said the mayor, Mario Rivas.On top of the blazes, five local men were killed in two separate mining accidents in nearby Asturias this year.\"It doesn't make up for the loss of the lives of our friends, but this shows us that there can also be good news,\" said Rivas.Most of the winning tickets in Villablino were sold by a local Alzheimer's association.In addition, the town of La Pola de Gordón, also in León and with a population of 3,000, shared out 60 million euros. Sixty-four million euros of jackpot money also went to a working-class district in Madrid.In Villablino, Maribel Martín had one of the winning décimos, worth €400,000 (£349,484). She was out doing grocery shopping when her son called her to give her the good news.\"We were really down and 200 million euros is a wonderful thing,\" she saidShe is clear what she wants to do with the prize money. \"Spread it around a bit and enjoy life,\" she said.",

Train cancellations and diversions were reported in the area during the day.The killed elephants were later examined by veterinarians and buried.Assam has one of the biggest elephant populations in India, with nearly 6,000 animals recorded in the state.Local railway tracks are often crossed by elephant herds - but Saturday's incident happened at a location that was not a designated elephant corridor, the Northeast Frontier Railway says.",

    "body": "11 hours agoJosh MartinBusiness reporterThe gold price has hit another record high, trading above $4,400 (£3,275) an ounce for the first time.The price of the precious metal has risen on expectations the US central bank will cut interest rates further next year, analysts said.Gold started the year worth $2,600 an ounce, but geopolitical tensions, the Trump tariffs and expectations of rate cuts have added to investor demand for safe haven assets, such as gold and other commodities.The prices of other precious metals also rose on Monday, with silver hitting a record high as well.The gold price has risen more than 68% this year, the highest increase since 1979, according to Adrian Ash, director of research at gold bullion marketplace BullionVault.2025 has seen \"slow-burning trends around interest rates, around war and trade tensions\", Mr Ash said, which have helped to push up the price of gold.\"The precious metals market says that President Trump has really triggered something – and gold has gone crazy this year.\"You've got the trade war, the attacks on the US Federal Reserve and you've got geopolitical tensions, all of those provocations come from Trump,\" he said.After passing the $4,400 an ounce mark on Monday, the spot price of gold hit a high of $4,426.66.Lower interest rate expectations typically mean lower returns for investments such as bonds, so investors look to commodities such as gold and silver to get a return, but also diversify their portfolios.The consensus among analysts currently is that the US will lower interest rates twice in 2026.Another factor adding to demand is that central banks globally are expanding their own physical holdings of gold as a way to counter economic turbulence, reduce reliance on the US dollar, and diversify their own portfolios, according to analysis from Goldman Sachs, which predicted the pattern would continue in 2026.The steady increase in the price of gold across the year could be because it is seen as a way for traders to help shield themselves from the threat of inflation and economic turmoil, Anita Wright, chartered financial planner at Ribble Wealth Management, said.\"When confidence in financial assets and policy stability starts to wobble, gold tends to respond first as the primary monetary metal,\" Ms Wright said.A weaker US dollar has also helped push gold prices higher by making the metal cheaper for overseas buyers.Other precious metals have also had record years. The price of silver also hit a record of $69.44 an ounce on Monday.For 2025 so far, silver is up 138% year-to-date and platinum is at a 17-year high, vastly outperforming gold, underpinned by strong and supply constraints, according to analysts. Unlike gold, the other precious metals are also used widely in industrial manufacturing which helps stoke demand.Separately, oil prices rose on Monday, after the US ordered a \"blockade\" last week of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela.The price of Brent crude rose $1.31 to $61.78 a barrel, while US oil was up $1.25 at $57.77. However, both measures look set to end 2025 at prices lower than where they started the year.",

    "body": "22 hours agoAbu Bakar YasinandNaomi Clarke,BBC NewsbeatGetty ImagesThe Fulham midfielder will represent his home country Nigeria in the competitionHe's played on some of the biggest stages in the world in the Premier League, but Alex Iwobi believes the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) is a \"special\" experience. The tournament will see 24 teams battling for the continental crown across the next couple of weeks. Fulham midfielder Iwobi will represent his home country of Nigeria in the competition, where they will be hoping to clinch the title after missing out in a 2-1 loss to Ivory Coast in 2023's final.\"With Afcon, you get to celebrate Africa through football,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat. \"You get to see different cultures, you get to see how different people dress, how people from Nigeria, the way we walk into the changing rooms.\"When some of the other countries walk into the changing rooms, we play music, so we're celebrating our music through that as well.\"Nigeria will be hoping to redeem themselves after failing to qualify for a second successive World Cup. Iwobi says it was a \"big disappointment\", but the team will be using it to fuel them in the Afcon tournament.\"We owe it to ourselves to make it right, and there's no better way from the last Afcon to improve (than) just to win this one,\" the 29-year-old says. This year's Afcon is being held in Morocco.Nigeria have won the competition three times over the years, the last being back in 2013. Their most recent loss to Ivory Coast is still prominent in Iwobi's mind as he says it \"shattered\" their dreams. However, he feels the moment was \"written\" for striker Sébastien Haller, who scored the winning goal after overcoming testicular cancer. \"It was a tough loss, but you give credit when credit due, they deserved it,\" Iwobi says.\"But it's also fuelled us and we've been working hard to get into the Afcon again and, hopefully, this is our story.\"Getty ImagesAlex Iwobi made his debut for Nigeria's national team in 2015The Fulham midfielder was born in Lagos, but moved to London as a child. His talent was spotted early and he was selected to represent England up to under-18 level.After many years with the Three Lions, he made his debut for Nigeria's national team in 2015 as he says he felt more \"at home\" with the team.\"England treated me with a lot of respect and they loved me,\" he says. \"But at the same time, I felt more of a connection with my roots in Nigeria.\"He has since made 91 appearances, making him the fourth most capped player for the Nigerian Super Eagles. Iwobi says he never thought he would play for Arsenal, Fulham, or Nigeria growing up, but he is \"honoured and grateful\" for his achievements. Ademola Lookman, Calvin Bassey and Iwobi's school friend Ola Aina are also among the players on the Nigerian national team who were not raised in the country.They have been affectionately nicknamed the \"innit boys\", and Iwobi hopes they have helped open the door for others to represent their home country. \"You're Nigerian at the end of the day and you will get loved regardless,\" he says.Getty ImagesIwobi says he never thought we would play for Arsenal, Fulham, or Nigeria in his careerThere has been debate over whether Afcon gets the respect it deserves.Earlier this year, Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher caused a stir when he suggested Afcon was not considered a \"major tournament\", when discussing Mohamed Salah's chances of winning the coveted Ballon d'Or.Iwobi feels there is still more work to be done.\"It's obviously getting recognised a lot more,\" he says. \"There's a lot of great talents, great nations representing.\"In the Premier League there's a lot of players in each team that are going to be represented so the awareness is growing, but it definitely deserves a lot more respect, in my opinion.\"If he wins the tournament, the Fulham player says he will be on the phone to his parents and sister straight away, while his extended family will be dancing.\"I've heard from previous people that when they win it, it's like everything just stops, you become like a king, you're just royalty,\" he says. \"Just going to the final we got treated like royalty anyway, so I can't imagine winning it.\"It would just be crazy, but I want to experience that.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "US and Ukrainian envoys said talks in Miami aimed at ending the war with Russia had been \"productive and constructive\" - but no major breakthrough that could bring Moscow and Kyiv closer to peace seems forthcoming.US President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, issued a joint statement with the top Ukrainian negotiator, Rustem Umerov, after three days of talks alongside European officials.The pair said the meeting focused on aligning positions on a 20-point plan, a \"multilateral security guarantee framework\", a \"US security guarantee framework for Ukraine\" and an \"economic & prosperity plan\". Separate talks also took place in Miami between the US and the Russian envoy, Kirill Dmitriev.\"Our shared priority is to stop the killing, ensure guaranteed security, and create conditions for Ukraine's recovery, stability, and long-term prosperity,\" Witkoff and Umerov said in a statement.The meetings are the latest step in weeks of diplomatic activity, sparked by the leaking of a 28-point US peace plan last month. That plan shocked Ukraine and its European allies for appearing to favour Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago.Witkoff said representatives from Russia had met himself and other US officials in southern Florida, including Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.The meetings with Russian envoy Dmitriev were also \"productive and constructive\", Witkoff said, adding that \"Russia remains fully committed to achieving peace in Ukraine\". On Monday the Kremlin said Dmitriev would travel back to Moscow to debrief Vladimir Putin on US proposals for a potential settlement. Suggestions that a three-way meeting between the US, Russia and Ukraine could be on the cards were brushed off by Moscow. Trump has been pushing Ukraine and Russia to come to an agreement on ending the war, but so far the two countries have been unable to agree on major issues, including Moscow's demand to be handed sections of the Donbas regions it has not managed to seize militarily.US intelligence reports continue to warn that Russian President Vladimir Putin still wants to capture all of Ukraine and reclaim parts of Europe that belonged to the former Soviet empire, six sources familiar with US intelligence told the Reuters news agency. \"This absolutely does not correspond to reality,\" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday. The comments came after Putin told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg that there will be no more wars after Ukraine, if Russia is treated with respect.\"There won't be any operations if you treat us with respect, if you respect our interests just as we've always tried to respect yours,\" he said.Russia has recently intensified its attacks on Ukraine's southern region of Odesa. Ukrainian officials have said the strikes - which on Sunday night hit port and energy infrastructure - were aiming to limit Ukraine's access to the Black Sea and disrupt critical logistics routes to the border with Moldova.Meanwhile, a Ukrainian drone attack damaged two vessels and two piers in Russia's southern Krasnodar region, Russian officials said on Monday. The damage led to a big fire, but Russian authorities say all crew were safely evacuated.  Some reports say oil infrastructure was targeted.",

    "body": "7 hours agoDavid GrittenReutersMSF said it would be \"a disaster for Palestinians\" if international NGOs are forced to stop operations in GazaThe UN and other aid agencies fear new Israeli registration rules for dozens of international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) risk the collapse of the humanitarian response in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.INGOs not registered by 31 December face closure of their operations in Israel within 60 days, which the agencies say could severely disrupt healthcare and other life-saving services in Gaza.Save the Children said its application had not been approved and it was \"pursuing all available avenues to have this decision reconsidered\".Israel's ministry of diaspora affairs and combating antisemitism said the departure of \"rogue organisations\" would not affect the delivery of aid.Fourteen out of the approximately 100 applications have so far been rejected, 21 have been approved, and those remaining are still undergoing review, according to the ministry.The registration system introduced in March includes several grounds for rejection, including:Denying the existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic stateDenying the Holocaust or the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023Supporting an armed struggle against Israel by an enemy state or terrorist organisationPromoting \"delegitimisation campaigns\" against IsraelCalling for a boycott of Israel or committing to participate in oneSupporting the prosecution of Israeli security forces in foreign or international courtsThe Humanitarian Country Team of the Occupied Palestinian Territory - a forum that brings together UN agencies and more than 200 local and international organisations - warned in a statement last Wednesday that the system \"fundamentally jeopardises\" the operations of INGOs in Gaza and the West Bank.\"The system relies on vague, arbitrary, and highly politicised criteria and imposes requirements that humanitarian organisations cannot meet without violating international legal obligations or compromising core humanitarian principles,\" it said.It added: \"While some INGOs have been registered under the new system, these INGOs represent only a fraction of the response in Gaza and are nowhere near the number required just to meet immediate and basic needs.\"According to the Humanitarian Country Team, INGOs currently run or support the majority of Gaza's field hospitals and primary healthcare centres, emergency shelter responses, water and sanitation services, nutrition stabilisation centres for children with acute malnutrition, and critical mine action activities.If they were forced to stop operations, it said, one in three health facilities in Gaza would close.\"Pressing ahead with this policy will have far-reaching consequences on the future of the OPT, in addition to threatening a fragile ceasefire and putting Palestinian lives at imminent risk, particularly during winter,\" the Humanitarian Country Team warned.\"The UN will not be able to compensate for the collapse of INGOs' operations if they are de-registered, and the humanitarian response cannot be replaced by alternative actors operating outside established humanitarian principles.\"It also stressed that Israel had an obligation under international humanitarian law to ensure that Gaza's population was adequately supplied.ReutersAn Israeli official said international NGOs, which support many hospitals in Gaza, had been given \"more than sufficient time\" to obtain registrationSave the Children - which has supported families in Gaza with clean water and cash assistance, as well as healthcare clinics and mother and baby areas - confirmed on Monday that it was informed several weeks ago that its registration application had not been approved.\"We are pursuing all available avenues to have this decision reconsidered, including filing a petition with the Israeli courts,\" a spokesperson told the BBC.\"While we call for this decision to be reconsidered, we remain committed to delivering vital and life-saving support to children and families in the Occupied Palestinian Territory through our team of over 300 dedicated Palestinian staff together with trusted partners.\"Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) - which supports six public hospitals and runs two field hospitals in Gaza, and has treated hundreds of thousands of patients over the past year - meanwhile said it was among the INGOs still waiting to obtain registration.\"With Gaza's health system already destroyed, independent and experienced humanitarian organisations losing access to respond would be a disaster for Palestinians,\" a statement said.\"MSF calls on the Israeli authorities to ensure that INGOs can maintain and continue their impartial and independent response in Gaza. The already restricted humanitarian response cannot be further dismantled.\"A spokesman for the Israeli diaspora affairs ministry told the BBC that it had already extended the registration deadline from 9 September to 31 December \"as an extraordinary measure and well beyond what was required\".\"There has been more than sufficient time to act, and any organisation that has failed to do so by now has demonstrated a clear lack of good faith,\" he said.He also stressed that the process had been carried out by a team that included all relevant Israeli security and government bodies, and that \"claims of a sweeping or mass rejection are false and misleading\".He added: \"Humanitarian aid will continue uninterrupted. The departure of rogue organisations whose real objective is to undermine the State of Israel under a humanitarian guise will not affect the ongoing delivery of aid.\"",

    "body": "Officials from Thailand and Cambodia will meet next week to discuss the possibility of reviving a ceasefire, Thailand's foreign minister said, as deadly border clashes entered a third week. Both countries had signed a ceasefire earlier in July, brokered by US President Donald Trump. But fighting broke out again earlier this month - which both countries have blamed each other for. On Monday, top officials from both countries met at a summit in Malaysia, their first first face-to-face meeting since fighting resumed.Speaking afterwards, Thailand's Foreign Minister said the July ceasefire was \"rushed\", saying it was because the US \"wanted the declaration signed in time for Trump's [visit]\".\"We were sometimes in a rush because the US wanted it signed by the visit of President Trump,\" said Sihasak Phuangketkeow.\"But sometimes we really just [need to] sit down, trash things [out]...  make sure that the ceasefire reflects... the situation on the ground. And the ceasefire is one that really holds.\"Mr Phuangketkeow said a meeting between military officials from both Thailand and Cambodia would take place on 24 December, and that this would need to happen before any ceasefire agreement could be reached. Cambodia has yet to comment on the matter. At least 41 people have been killed and almost one million displaced since the renewed fighting this month. Both countries have blamed each other for the fresh hostilities. The most recent fighting has seen the exchange of artillery fire along the 800km (500-mile) border. Thailand has also launched air strikes targetting Cambodian positions.At the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) meeting on Monday, Malaysia's foreign minister had asked both sides and other Asean members to give the matter \"our most urgent attention\".\"We must consider the wider ramifications of the continued escalation of the situation for the people we serve,\" Mohamad Hasan told his counterparts, according to news agency AFP.The conflict has been the worst between Asean member states since the association was founded in 1967. The failure to contain it represents a serious blow to the bloc's credibility.The US and China have also been attempting to mediate a new ceasefire.China's special envoy for Asian affairs, Deng Xijun, visited Phnom Penh last week. A statement from Beijing said he reaffirmed that China would continue to play a constructive role in facilitating dialogue between Cambodia and Thailand.On Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at the daily press briefing that China had been mediating the confict in its own way since fighting restarted this month. He added that Beijing would release information on the mediation conducted by Deng \"in due course\".The argument between Thailand and Cambodia dates back more than a century, and there have been sporadic clashes, with soldiers and civilians killed on both sides over the years. But in May, tensions ramped up after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash. And on  24 July, the situation dramatically escalated after a Cambodian rocket barrage into Thailand, which was followed by Thai air strikes. That set off five days of intense fighting, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead.The two countries later agreed to an \"immediate and unconditional ceasefire\" brokered by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and US President Donald Trump - who at the time threatened to stop tariff negotiations until the hostilities stopped.The US president later oversaw the signing of what he dubbed \"the Kuala Lumpar peace accord\" in October. Thailand refused to call it that - instead referring to it as \"Joint Declaration by the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia on the outcomes of their meeting in Kuala Lumpur\".But that ceasefire fell apart in December, with both sides blaming each other for re-igniting the fighting, which has seen air strikes and exchanges of artillery fire.Additional reporting by Jonathan Head and Thanyarat Doksone",

    "body": "Civil rights groups and pro-gun advocates in Australia have raised concerns that new fast-tracked laws will place undue restrictions on firearms and protests in the wake of the Bondi shootings.On Monday, the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) recalled its parliament to debate a raft of new laws such as banning the phrase \"globalise the intifada\", limiting the number of guns one person can own, and greater police powers for protests.NSW Premier Chris Minns said some may feel the changes had \"gone too far\" but they were needed to keep the community safe.A pro-gun politician said the laws unfairly target law-abiding gun owners while civil libertarians said restrictions on protests were an affront to democracy.On banning the \"intifada\" phrase, Minns said its use at protests in Australia and around the world \"are a call to a global intifada. That is what it means. Not in the Middle East, not in Israel or Gaza but here in Sydney\".\"I do believe it leads to a culture and environment of heightened disunity,\" he said, and \"an invitation to violence\".The term intifada came into popular use during the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1987.Some have described the term as a call for violence against Jewish people. Others have said it is a call for peaceful resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and actions in Gaza.In the aftermath of the Bondi attacks, in which 15 people were killed, the Jewish community accused the government of not doing enough to protect it from rising antisemitism.The new protest laws will also allow police to restrict demonstrations at places of worship, with stronger penalties for breaches.Timothy Roberts, president of the NSW Council for Civil Liberties, said the new law ignores a recent decision by the state's supreme court which found the so-called \"move-on power\" at religious locations went against Australia's implied constitutional freedom of political communication.Religious institutions exercise significant and overt political power in Australian politics and this makes them a legitimate site of protest in a democratic society, Mr Roberts said. \"The laws introduced today are an affront to our right to assemble and communicate with each other,\" he said, adding they \"damage our democracy\".He said Minns wants social cohesion but he does not know the meaning of the term. \"He thinks silence is peace, and does not seem to realise it can also reflect oppression. Passing laws that oppress some parts of our community in the wake of an attack like we saw, does not bring us closer - it drives us further apart and stops us from healing well in this time of grief.\"Police will also be able to remove face coverings from protesters who are suspected of committing an offence - including low-level offences - during a protest. Previously, police could only do so if someone is arrested or suspected of committing an indictable offence. On gun reform, the new laws will mean licence holders in NSW cannot own more than four firearms with exceptions for farmers and sport shooters who can have up to ten. The move follows similar laws introduced in Western Australia earlier this year to cap gun ownership. Elsewhere across the country, there are no limits.One of the gunmen in the Bondi shooting, Sajid Akram, had six registered firearms. Other gun law changes include more regular renewals for gun licence holders from every five years to every two years, and a review of the types of firearms available to most gun owners.Mark Banasiak from the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party - which lobbies for more relaxed gun laws - said the state's 260,000 gun licence holders were being \"punished\" and \"made a scapegoat for agency failings\".\"We're diverting away from what the real problem is,\" he said, referring to \"a climate of hate and division that's been allowed to fester for two and a half years because government haven't done enough to stop that.\"Walter Mikac, whose wife and two young daughters were among the 35 people shot dead in Tasmania by a lone gunman in 1996 in what is Australia's deadliest mass shooting, welcomed the reforms.The changes will \"close critical gaps in our gun laws\" and put community safety first, he said. The government also aims to crackdown on hate speech and symbols, as well as enabling police to ban protests for up to three months after a terrorist attack.Palestine Action Group spokesperson Josh Lees said the new laws were \"incredibly draconian\".\"Australia is seen as a safe country,\" he said, \"where freedom of speech is very important\" but the Bondi shooting was \"perhaps changing the dynamics of that democracy and that freedom\".David Ossip, president of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies, said moves to ban \"intifada\" chants was a \"watershed moment\" in confronting hate and incitement. He also welcomed greater police powers during protests.\"The right to protest is a core Australian value and a fundamental tenet of a democratic society,\" he said.\"But it has never included the right to hide your face and shout slogans calling for violence against one's fellow Australians or waving the flags of groups devoted to murder and destruction.\"Additional reporting by Katy Watson",

    "body": "Watch: Images, cassettes and high-profile figures - What's in the latest Epstein files?A pair of US lawmakers have threatened legal action against US Attorney General Pam Bondi, after her deadline to release all government files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was met only in part. The release of the Department of Justice (DoJ) documents was highly anticipated but in the end, only a portion of the available material was made public.A leading campaigner on the issue, Republican congressman Thomas Massie, said he could try to bring contempt proceedings against the attorney general as a result.The DoJ insists it is complying with its legal obligations, and Bondi herself has said she is part of \"the most transparent administration in American history\".In addition to the move by Massie in the House, the top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, has announced an effort of his own to put pressure on the DoJ.On Monday, Senate Minority Leader Schumer said he would introduce a resolution in the Senate to take legal actions of its own against the Trump administration for failing to release the files in full and \"to hold the Department of Justice accountable\". The issue would be considered when the upper chamber reconvenes in January. Schumer appealed for support from Republican senators, pointing out that the law to release of the full trove was a bipartisan effort. The phrase \"Epstein files\" refer to the trove of information that was amassed by the US justice department during its two criminal investigations into Epstein.A law that compelled the release of the full trove was signed by US President Donald Trump in November, after pressure from his supporters and members of his own Republican Party. Friday was the deadline for the release of the material. Although some material was released, there were many redactions and other information was withheld - which angered Massie and his allies, as well as survivors of Epstein's abuse. Trump himself is yet to comment.The DoJ has said that more material will follow in the coming weeks. But speaking to CBS programme Face the Nation on Sunday, Massie suggested that the justice department was \"flouting the spirit and the letter of the law\".He went on to say: \"The quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi, and that doesn't require going through the courts.\"Inherent contempt is a little-used legal recourse that can be used by either the Senate or House - the upper and lower chambers of Congress respectively - which has not been invoked for nearly a century, according to the American Bar Association.Massie added that \"Ro Khanna and I are talking about and drafting that right now\", referring to a Democratic congressman who has also been prominent in the campaign for the release of the full Epstein files.Speaking to the same programme, Khanna gave further detail on how the contempt proceedings could work. \"We're building a bipartisan coalition, and it would fine Pam Bondi for every day that she's not releasing these documents,\" he said.Unlike an impeachment effort - another option that would be theoretically available to critics of Bondi - the contempt move would only require support from the House of Representatives, Massie pointed out in Sunday's interview. During an interview of his own on Sunday, with a different broadcaster, Bondi's deputy Todd Blanche was defiant.Asked by the Meet the Press programme on NBC News whether he took threats from Congress members seriously, the deputy attorney general said: \"Not even a little bit. Bring it on. We are doing everything we're supposed to be doing to comply with the statute.\"Blanche pointed to the magnitude of the task. \"You're talking about a million or so pages of documents,\" he said. \"Virtually all of them contain victim information.\" He continued: \"And if by complying with the statute we don't produce everything on Friday, we produce things next week and the week after, that's still compliance with the statute.\"Speaking to the same programme, another member of Khanna's party, Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, said contempt or impeachment efforts would be \"premature\".\"We have tools in appropriations bills and other tools to force compliance if somebody is dragging their feet and I'd rather focus on those tools,\" Kaine said.Blanche said elsewhere on Sunday that certain Epstein-related files that were originally released on Friday were later removed by the DoJ from its website because of concerns raised by victims.One of those files - an image featuring Trump - was later reinstated after review, said Blanche.",

    "body": "16 hours agoShaimaa Khalil,JerusalemandMallory MoenchIsrael's security cabinet has approved the recognition of 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank as the government continues its settlement expansion push.Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a settler who proposed the move alongside Defence Minister Israel Katz, said the decision was about blocking the establishment of a Palestinian state. Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are considered illegal under international law. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said Israel's \"relentless\" settlement expansion fuels tensions, restricts Palestinian access to land, and threatens the viability of a sovereign Palestinian state. Saudi Arabia and the UK also condemned the move. The announcement risked \"undermining the [US] 20 Point Plan [for ending the Gaza war] and prospects for the long-term peace and security that only a two-state solution can deliver\", said UK foreign office minister Hamish Falconer.Violence in the occupied West Bank has surged since the war in Gaza began following Hamas's deadly attack on Israel in October 2023, further heightening fears that settlement expansion could entrench Israel's occupation and undermine a two-state solution.The two-state solution refers to the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital, broadly along the lines that existed prior to the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.Since taking office in 2022, the current Israeli government has significantly increased the approval of new settlements and begun the legalisation process for unauthorised outposts, recognising them as \"neighbourhoods\" of existing settlements.The most recent decision brings the total number of settlements approved over the past three years to 69, according to Smotrich.The approvals come just days after the United Nations said settlement expansion had reached its highest level since 2017. The latest approvals include the re-establishment of two settlements — Ganim and Kadim — which were dismantled nearly 20 years ago.In May, Israel approved 22 new settlements in the occupied West Bank - the biggest expansion in decades.The Israeli government also approved plans in August to build more than 3,000 homes in the so-called E1 project between Jerusalem and the Maale Adumim settlement, which had been frozen for decades amid fierce opposition internationally.Smotrich at the time said the plan would \"bury the idea of a Palestinian state\".About 700,000 settlers live in approximately 160 settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, according to Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now. It is land Palestinians seek for a future independent state.Settlement expansion has angered Arab nations who have consistently said it undermines prospects for a two-state solution. It has also raised concerns about the possible annexing of the occupied West Bank.US President Donald Trump had warned Israel about such a move, telling TIME magazine that Israel would lose all its support from the US if it happened.In September, the UK - along with other countries including Australia and Canada - recognised a Palestinian state, a significant although symbolic change in government policy.Israel opposed the move, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying a Palestinian state \"will not happen\".",

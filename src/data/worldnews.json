    "body": "16 hours agoHelen LivingstoneSydneyGettySussan Ley has been deposed by Angus Taylor (back centre) as leader of Australia's Liberal party The first female leader of Australia's Liberal Party, Sussan Ley, has been ousted after just nine months in the job, losing a leadership ballot to her former shadow defence minister Angus Taylor.Ley was elevated to the role after the party suffered a resounding defeat in last year's election, but since then has been plagued by poor poll numbers and infighting among the conservative Liberal-National Coalition.Taylor had announced he would challenge her for leadership of the opposition on Wednesday, ending months of speculation.In a social media post he said his election on Friday was \"an immense honour\" and that he looked forward to working with new deputy leader Jane Hume.Taylor, from the party's conservative faction, won the secret ballot, 34 votes to 17.Shortly after the results were announced, Ley said that she would resign as an MP and step away \"completely and comprehensively from public life\".She told waiting reporters she harboured \"no hard feelings\" towards the new leader although, in an apparent jab at the infighting she has endured, she added that it was important he get \"clear air, something that is not always afforded to leaders\".  Taylor, who narrowly lost the 2025 leadership contest to Ley, is a former management consultant who first entered parliament in 2013. He served as a minister under Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison.Ley's position had never seemed secure. The Liberal-National coalition, a partnership dating back to the 1940s, twice split under her leadership, the first time immediately after the May election and the second time just weeks ago.A series of recent polls have also shown the populist One Nation Party - which only got 6% of the national vote last year - overtaking the Coalition to take second place behind Labor. Ley's personal ratings have also been poor.The coalition has largely failed to agree on what caused its crushing election defeat to Labor, which saw the Liberals all but wiped out in the major cities, with disagreements on energy and climate policy in a particular.Reflecting on her time at the helm, Ley said it had been \"very tough\" at times but added: \"I was part of the early punk rock movement in Canberra, I will continue to find wisdom in one of punk's defining themes, a fearless and honest belief in yourself.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoHelen LivingstoneSydneyGettyPolice detain a protester at a rally in Sydney against a visit by Israeli President Isaac Herzog on MondayThe New South Wales (NSW) Police watchdog will investigate allegations of misconduct against officers after violent clashes with people protesting against a visit by the Israeli president.The Law Enforcement Conduct Commission said it had decided it was \"in the public interest\" to investigate Monday's police operation after receiving a \"significant number of complaints\".Videos that emerged after the rally appeared to show police punching protesters and dragging away a group of praying Muslim men. A state MP was among those who said she was injured.NSW's police commissioner has previously defended officers, saying they showed \"remarkable restraint\" after protesters ignored directions.The commission said on Friday that it would review all available material, including video footage, as well as conducting hearings before delivering a public report to the state parliament.Despite objections from pro-Palestinian groups, the government invited him to Australia after an antisemitic attack at Bondi Beach in December, saying it would help the Jewish community heal.The Palestine Action Group (PAG), which organised Monday's protest, welcomed the investigation and called on NSW Police Commissioner Malcolm Lanyon and NSW Premier Chris Minns to resign.\"The police operation bore all the hallmarks of a police riot, targeting peaceful demonstrators,\" said Amal Naser. \"Genocide is a crime. Protest is not.\"The Australian National Imams Council said on Friday that the police conduct had not reflected \"the Australia we know\" and reiterated its demand for an apology.The Australia Palestine Advocacy Network (APAN) said there must be \"transparency\" and \"consequences where wrongdoing occurred\", adding that the protest exposed \"a disturbing pattern of anti-Palestinian racism\".\"This is not only about one protest nor just about the Palestine justice movement - it is about the shrinking of democratic space and an attack on the fundamental freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly,\" said APAN's Katie Shammas.Immediately after the Bondi attack, Minns introduced restrictions on protests and ahead of Herzog's visit announced additional \"major event\" powers effectively giving police authority to shut down areas of the city.Monday's rally took place just half an hour after protesters lost a legal bid to overturn the major powers designation.The rules allowed demonstrators to gather but forbade them from marching. Police say \"a number of melees\" broke out after crowds were ordered to move away from the area.Twenty-seven people were arrested at the protest and nine later charged, while 10 officers were assaulted, police said.NSW Police said in a statement that it will \"work co-operatively\" with the watchdog inquiry.\"The LECC is a strong and independent oversight body, and we respect this process,\" Police Minister Yasmin Catley said.Minns has previously defended police actions, saying on Tuesday that police had been \"put in an impossible situation\", urging the public \"not to look at a 10-second clip without the full context\". On Thursday, he refused to apologise to the Muslim community for police breaking up their prayer, saying he did not believe officers would have done so \"unless it was in the middle of a riot\". Lanyon has apologised \"for any offence that may have been taken\".",

    "body": "7 minutes agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorBloomberg via Getty ImagesPeter Magyar is ahead in the polls with less than two months to go before electionsLess than two months before Hungary's election, opposition leader Peter Magyar has accused his rivals of planning to blackmail him with a secretly recorded sex tape, and says he is filing a complaint with authorities.Magyar, who leads long-time Prime Minister Viktor Orban in the polls, said he suspected there were plans to release a tape of him from August 2024, when he says he engaged in consensual sex with a now ex-girlfriend at a party.He was responding to a photo recently posted online of a bedroom in an apartment dating back to then. Leading figures in Orban's Fidesz party said they knew nothing about the claims. The BBC has approached Orban's spokesman for comment.Magyar accused Fidesz of trying to blackmail him and made three allegations of unlawful conduct in a statement on Friday.Although no video has been published, he said one from that date would have been \"recorded with secret service equipment and possibly faked\".Magyar made no mention in his statement of the ex-girlfriend he had been with at the time of the alleged incident, although he said on Thursday he had accused her of extortion 15 months ago - an allegation she denied.She told Hungarian media that they were both victims regarding the alleged illicit video and she was ready to take legal action with him.Magyar accused Fidesz leaders of timing their campaign to coincide with the start of his nationwide campaign next week, and of trying to ruin the last week he was spending with his three sons ahead of the April election.Fidesz communications director Tamas Menczer accused Magyar of lying, while Orban's chief of staff Gergely Gulyas told reporters he could not comment on something he knew nothing about.Orban, Hungary's nationalist leader, has been in office for 16 years, but with parliamentary elections on 12 April, Magyar's centre-right Tisza party is at least eight points ahead in the latest opinion poll by Hungary's Idea Institute.Fidesz has so far focused its campaign on attacking the European Union, accusing Brussels of trying to bring down his government. He is seen as Vladimir Putin's closest ally in Europe and has called on the EU to stop sending money to Ukraine.On Friday, US President Donald Trump praised Orban as a \"truly strong and powerful leader\", ahead of a visit by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Trump said he had been \"proud to ENDORSE Viktor\" for re-election in 2022 and was \"honoured to do so again\".The election campaign is not even due to start until 21 February, but Magyar's allegations of dirty tricks are an indication of how murky the next few weeks may become.Magyar has built support across Hungary over the past two years, promising to reset relations with Hungary's European partners. A one-time Fidesz loyalist, he was once married to former justice minister Judit Varga, whose political career ended during a scandal in 2024. They divorced the year prior.",

    "body": "14 hours agoToby MannGetty ImagesJapanese authorities say they have seized a Chinese fishing vessel that tried to flee when ordered to stop for an inspection, in a move that may further fuel tensions with Beijing.The boat was in Japan's exclusive economic zone off Nagasaki Prefecture in the south-west when it was intercepted and its captain arrested on Thursday, according to the country's fisheries agency.\"The vessel's captain was ordered to stop for an inspection by a fisheries inspector, but the vessel failed to comply and fled,\" the fisheries agency said.The seizure is the first time since 2022 that the agency has seized a Chinese fishing boat. China has yet to react to Japan's statement. There were 11 people aboard, including the captain who is a 47-year-old Chinese national, the fisheries agency said. Authorities and Japanese media have described the seized vessel as a \"tiger net fishing boat\" with a high capacity.\"We will continue to take resolute action in our enforcement activities to prevent and deter illegal fishing operations by foreign vessels,\" Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said on Friday.Thursday's incident comes amid strained relations after Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi enraged China in November by suggesting Tokyo would intervene militarily if Beijing sought to take Taiwan by force.China has long insisted that Taiwan, occupied for decades by Japan until 1945, is its territory.It has not ruled out using force to achieve what it calls \"reunification\".In response to Takaichi's remarks, which China's foreign ministry described as \"egregious\", Beijing summoned Tokyo's ambassador and warned its citizens to reconsider travel and study in Japan.That led to a sharp drop in visits to Japan by Chinese tourists, and a subsequent hit to Japanese stocks related to tourism and retail.As the diplomatic spat deepened during the end of 2025, Beijing repeatedly demanded that Takaichi retract her comments, and its foreign ministry warned Japan to \"stop playing with fire\".Japanese artists touring China have also had shows cancelled and releases of popular Japanese movies have been postponed.",

    "body": "24 hours agoAlicia CurryNurPhoto via Getty ImagesThorbjørn Jagland's lawyer has previously said he denies criminal liability and is willing to cooperateFormer Norwegian Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland has been charged with \"gross corruption\" over his ties with the US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, police have said.The charge was brought after the Council of Europe lifted Jagland's immunity, which he enjoyed because of his past diplomatic role. He denies criminal liability and is willing to cooperate, his lawyer says.Emails released by the US government are thought to show that Jagland planned solo and family visits to Epstein's homes in Paris, New York and Palm Beach after the billionaire was convicted of a child sex offence.Three of Jagland's properties were searched by Norwegian crime unit Økokrim and he is now expected to be questioned.As well as serving as prime minister from 1996 to 1997, Jagland is also a former head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee and spent a decade as secretary general of the Council of Europe.Jagland had diplomatic immunity from heading the Council, Europe's watchdog for democracy and human rights, for alleged acts carried out during his 2009 to 2019 tenure.The so-called Epstein files appear to show instances where the late financier covered the travel expenses to his properties for Jagland and his family.The former leader had planned a family trip to Epstein's private Caribbean island in 2014, but it was ultimately cancelled after Epstein fell ill. Jagland also faces allegations that he solicited Epstein's help in obtaining a bank loan in another exchange, although it is not clear whether this materialised, according to Norwegian broadcaster NRK. Police have not confirmed whether this allegation is part of the gross corruption charge.Mention in the Epstein files - which have been released by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) - does not indicate any wrongdoing. Jagland was seen walking out of his home alongside his lawyer in Oslo on Thursday, one of the properties - alongside two in Risør and Rauland - that Økokrim confirmed it had searched. Politicians, celebrities and royals have been caught up in the turmoil after the US DOJ published the latest tranche of files last month, containing millions of private emails, images and FBI reports into the late sex offender - who died in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking. The Nordic country has seen several public figures drawn into the widening scandal, including Crown Princess Mette-Marit, diplomats Mona Juul and Terje Rød-Larsen, and chief executive of the World Economic Forum (WEF), Borge Brende.Juul's lawyer has said she \"does not recognise the accusations made against her\" and Rød-Larsen's lawyer said he is confident the investigation will clarify \"there is no basis for criminal liability\".The WEF ordered an independent review into Brende - who also served as the Norwegian foreign minister - over his interactions with the paedophile.Brende has acknowledged dining with Epstein three times in 2018 and 2019 and communicating with him by email and text, but said he was \"completely unaware\" of his past criminal activity. He added that he welcomes the WEF's decision to launch a review.",

    "body": "6 hours agoMichael Sheils McNameeFBIThe FBI has now confirmed that the masked man seen in the video is a suspect in the case The FBI has released the first physical description of the man believed to have kidnapped Nancy Guthrie, the mother of US news anchor Savannah Guthrie. Nancy Guthrie, 84, disappeared in the middle of night from her Tucson, Arizona, home and was last seen two weeks ago. The authorities believe she was taken against her will.The FBI has analysed footage from a doorbell camera outside her home and believes she was kidnapped by a male who is between 5ft 9in (175cm) and 5ft 10in tall, with an average build. It is first time the man in the video has been officially identified as a suspect in the case, which has drawn a huge amount of attention both in the US and abroad.In its latest statement, the FBI said it had been able to establish identifying details after carrying out a forensic analysis. It highlighted the backpack being worn by the suspect in the video, which was released earlier this week, and identified it is a 25-litre Ozark Trail Hiker Pack.A pair of black gloves has also been found during the search for Guthrie, the BBC's US broadcast partner CBS reported on Thursday.FBINancy Guthrie was last seen on the evening of Saturday 31 January when family members dropped her home. Members of her church noticed her absence at Sunday's service and notified her family.Officials have warned she may be in dire health without her medication. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said she was \"not in good physical health\" but had no reported cognitive issues.Since 1 February, the FBI said it had received more than 13,000 tips in relation to the case - including 4,000 in the 24 hours after the doorbell camera footage was released. It is offering money to anyone who comes forward with information about her disappearance and has now doubled the reward from $50,000 (£36,700) to $100,000. Getty ImagesThe reward for information related to the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie has increased to $100,000Earlier this week, a man was detained in connection with Guthrie's disappearance and his home in Rio Rico - south of Tucson, Arizona - was searched before he was released. Speaking to reporters following the incident and said he did not know who Nancy Guthrie was. Savannah Guthrie and her two siblings have released a number of social media pleas directed at their mother's potential abductors. They believe she is still alive and have indicated they would be willing to pay for her return. ",

    "body": "1 hour agoAnna LamcheandMarianne Baisnee,in ParisGettyA water leak at the Louvre has caused damage to a 19th Century ceiling painting, in the latest major setback for the Parisian museum.Water damage was discovered in room 707, also known as the \"Duchâtel\" room, late on Thursday night, the museum said. The room houses multiple 15th and 16th Century artworks.The museum said the leak - from a heating pipe - was stopped shortly after midnight and the only painting damaged was Charles Meynier's The Apotheosis of Poussin, Le Sueur and Le Brun.It comes a day after French police reportedly detained nine people - including two museum staff - over a suspected ticket fraud scheme.The Louvre said Thursday night's leak occurred at the entrance to the paintings department in the Denon wing.It said firefighters responded \"immediately\" and the leak was stopped 40 minutes after it began.A painting restorer inspected Meynier's ceiling painting on Friday morning and found it had \"two tears in the same area, caused by the water, and the paint layer on the ceiling and its arches has lifted\".The ceiling painting, signed by Meynier in 1822, depicts lauded French painters Nicolas Poussin, Eustache Le Sueur, and Charles Le Brun, who appear in the clouds among angelic figures.Rooms 706, 707 and 708 in the Denon wing on the building's first floor were closed on Friday morning, but are expected to reopen later in the day.The chief architect of historic monuments also came to assess the condition of the ceiling, the Louvre said, but found there were no structural problems.A union representative told news agency Reuters that scaffolding had been erected in the affected area.The cost of the damage to the painting and the building remains unclear.This leak is the latest in a long series of problems faced by the museum, which is the most visited in the world, in the recent past.The month prior, structural weaknesses prompted the partial closure of one of the galleries hosting Greek vases and offices.This came shortly after a high-profile heist on 19 October in which four burglars made off with historic jewellery worth €88m (£76m; $102m), exposing glaring gaps in the musuem's security.The brazen theft involved a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift, which was used to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine.A report published in October by France's public audit body criticised the museum's excessive spending on artwork, which it said was \"to the detriment of the maintenance and renovation of buildings.\"Musee du LouvreCharles Meynier's ceiling painting (pictured) suffered two tears and lifted paint due to the latest leak",

    "body": "19 hours agoEmma Pengelly,BBC VerifyandGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianVantorIran has been fortifying an underground complex near one of its nuclear facilities, according to analysis of new satellite images.This activity comes at a time of heightened tensions as talks between Iranian and US officials continue, with President Donald Trump threatening fresh military action against Iran if it does not agree a new deal on its nuclear programme.The photos, first analysed by the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS), a US-based think tank, show tunnel entrances being strengthened at Mount Kolang Gaz La - also known as Pickaxe Mountain.Experts say this facility may be designed to protect Iran's uranium enrichment activities or key equipment, but its exact purpose - and whether it is operational - remains unclear.Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and denies it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.However, Trump said Iran was as little as a month away from having a nuclear weapon in June 2025, when he ordered strikes on three underground nuclear sites where centrifuges were being used to produce highly enriched uranium during a 12-day war between Israel and Iran last year.Trump said the strikes had \"obliterated\" Iran's enrichment capacity, but that Iranian officials \"were thinking about starting a new site\".Pickaxe Mountain was not one of the locations attacked in US and Israeli air strikes in June 2025, but the Natanz nuclear facility, located about 2km (1.24 miles) north, was hit.A satellite image from 10 February shows what appears to be fresh concrete laid on top of one of the Pickaxe Mountain entrance areas.A boom pump used to deliver concrete can be seen at the location, analysts from both ISIS and UK-based intelligence analysis firm Maiar agreed.At another tunnel entrance, rock and soil has been pushed back and flattened. There's also a new concrete-reinforced structure nearby.Experts at ISIS suggest these changes are intended to strengthen the tunnel entrances and give additional protection against a potential air strike.ISIS says the ongoing presence of heavy construction machinery and material indicates the facility is not likely to be ready for operations yet.\"In the past, Iran has tied the construction to rebuilding an advanced centrifuge assembly plant, but the size of the facility, as well as the protection provided by the tall mountain, raised immediate concern whether additional sensitive activities are planned, such as uranium enrichment,\" they said.Satellite images also show repair work and defensive strengthening has been taking place at the nearby Natanz nuclear site and at the Isfahan nuclear complex, 125km (77 miles) to the north, in recent weeks.At Isfahan, all entrances to its tunnel complex now appear to be sealed off with earth, satellite images reviewed by ISIS reveal..Backfilling the tunnel entrances like this would \"help dampen\" any air strike, ISIS says, as well as help to defend against a land-based assault to seize or destroy any highly enriched uranium that may be housed inside..ISIS has assessed the roof was added to block the view of anyone trying to observe what Iran was doing beneath it.Prof Sina Azodi, director of the Middle East Studies Program at George Washington University in the US, says Iran is \"operating under the assumption that the attacks are going to happen and they need to protect the facilities as much as they can\".\"[The] Iranian nuclear programme hasn't been destroyed,\" he added. \"Clearly once you have the knowledge and capacity and technology to reconstruct the programme, you can always rebuild everything.\"Rafael Grossi, the head of the global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, told the BBC a new nuclear deal between Iran and the US was possible and was urgently needed.\"My sense, talking to all those involved, is that we have a window of opportunity, but windows of opportunity have a tendency to shut themselves quite abruptly and brusquely, so I think the we need to seize the moment,\" he said in an interview at the Munich Security Conference.He also said he believed Iran's estimated 400kg of highly enriched uranium - which is a short, technical step away from weapons grade - remained in the underground tunnels and chambers where the US dropped bunker-busting bombs last June.Graphics by Tom ShielMore on this story",

    "body": "7 hours agoMatt McGrathEnvironment correspondentTrump announces rollback of Obama-era greenhouse gas rulingUS President Donald Trump has reversed a key Obama-era scientific ruling that underpins all federal actions on curbing planet-warming gases.The so-called 2009 \"endangerment finding\" concluded that a range of greenhouse gases were a threat to public health. It's become the legal bedrock of federal efforts to rein in emissions, especially in vehicles.The White House called the reversal the \"largest deregulation in American history\", saying it would make cars cheaper, bringing down costs for automakers by $2,400 per vehicle.Environmental groups say the move is by far the most significant rollback on climate change yet attempted and are set to challenge it in the courts.Speaking in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said the 2009 ruling  was \"a disastrous Obama era policy that severely damaged the American auto industry and massively drove up prices for American consumers\".\"This radical rule became the legal foundation for the Green New Scam, one of the greatest scams in history,\" added the Republican president, about the Democrats' climate agenda.Former President Barack Obama, who infrequently comments on the policies of sitting presidents, said that repealing the finding would make Americans more vulnerable.\"Without it, we'll be less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change — all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money,\" he wrote on X. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) first took a stance on the impacts of greenhouse gases in 2009, in the first year of Obama's first term.The agency decided that six key planet-warming greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, were a danger to human health.With a divided Congress unable to agree on legislation to tackle rising global temperatures, the EPA finding became central to federal efforts to rein in emissions in the years that followed.\"The endangerment finding has really served as the lynchpin of US regulation of greenhouse gases,\" said Meghan Greenfield, a former EPA and Department of Justice attorney.\"So that includes motor vehicles, but it also includes power plants, the oil and gas sector, methane from landfills, even aircraft. So it really runs the gamut, all of the standards for each of the sectors is premised on this one thing.\"Trump administration officials are stressing that overturning the regulation will save more than $1tn and will help cut the price of energy and transport.Reversing the finding will reduce automobile manufacturers' costs by $2,400 per vehicle, the White House claimed.These regulations have been an economic strain, said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, who served in the US Department of Transportation during the first Trump term.\"The burden on the economy results in higher prices and manufacturing has left. It's gone to China, where it's made in a dirtier way,\" she told the BBC. \"So to say that we're reducing global emissions by ending energy intensive manufacturing in some countries, then having it go to China and India, where it's made in a dirtier way, does not reduce global emissions.\"Many environmentalists are sceptical of the potential cost savings being touted by the Trump team. \"It's going to force Americans to spend more money, around $1.4tn in additional fuel costs to power these less efficient and higher polluting vehicles,\" said Peter Zalzal from the Environmental Defense Fund.\"We've also analysed the health impacts and found that the action would result in up to 58,000 additional premature deaths, 37 million more asthma attacks,\" he said.For some in the US car industry there will be uncertainty about the rollback as manufacturing less fuel-efficient vehicles might limit their sales overseas.\"This rollback is sort of cementing things that have already been done, such as the relaxation of the fuel economy standards,\" said Michael Gerrard, a climate law expert from Columbia University.\"But it really does put the US automakers in a bind, because nobody else is going to want to buy American cars.\"While the reversal will help the White House to roll back climate change regulations, there are likely to be unintended consequences, according to some observers.While working on overturning the finding, the Trump administration also utilised the 2009 ruling to prevent states from passing laws that would be stricter on carbon emissions.The fact that the finding gave responsibility for regulating warming gases to a federal authority was also used to suppress what are termed \"nuisance\" lawsuits, brought by individuals or organisations on the climate question.\"The endangerment finding decision has blocked any number of lawsuits, and has been pretty powerful in keeping plaintiffs' claims out of court ,\" said Meghan Greenfield, now with Washington law firm of Jenner & Block.\"I would expect states and non-profit groups to bring suits, probably primarily in our state courts, to try to figure out where the contours of this new law are.\"John Kerry to BBC: Trump's climate change policy will 'cost lives'Challenging climate science One key argument about the reversal of the endangerment finding will be about the science on which it is based. The Department of Energy formed a panel of scientists to write a report last year challenging widely accepted science on the warming impact of greenhouse gases.That report underpinned the initial proposal to reverse the 2009 finding.But many climate experts complained that the panel behind the report was unrepresentative and filled with people who were sceptical of the human influence on warming, and that it was inaccurate and misleading.While it's not clear how much the Trump administration will rely on this report to face off any challenges, a federal judge recently ruled that the department had violated the law in the formation of the hand-picked team that wrote it.In fact, a challenge in court on the reversal of the endangerment finding may well be what the Trump administration is now looking for.Many legal experts believe that they want the proposal to be tested in the Supreme Court before Trump's term ends, believing that if they win, the endangerment finding will be consigned to history.\"This is really different as the EPA is exiting the space entirely and wants to do it on a permanent basis,\" Meghan Greenfield said.\"If they were to win that issue as they framed it before the Supreme Court, a new presidential administration could not change that position, in the absence of new legislation.\"",

    "body": "Just nowSimon Fraser,Asia digital editor, LondonandYogita Limaye,South Asia and Afghanistan correspondent, DhakaReutersTarique Rahman has promised that democracy will be restoredThe centre-right Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has secured a landslide majority in parliament, 18 months after mass protests ousted the country's longest serving prime minister Sheikh Hasina.The party took more than two-thirds of seats in the historic general election, with Jamaat, the country's main Islamist party, coming second. Hasina's Awami League was banned from taking part.BNP leader Tarique Rahman is set to be the next prime minister and faces huge challenges in getting the economy back on its feet and restoring democracy after 15 years of authoritarian rule under Hasina.Voters also backed sweeping democratic reforms in a referendum held alongside the election.\"I am grateful for the love you have shown me,\" Tarique Raman told well-wishers in Dhaka as he attended Friday prayers. His party said there would be no victory procession and he urged supporters to attend prayers instead of street celebrations in memory of his late mother, former PM Khaleda Zia, who died in December.His formal election as the country's new leader will happen after new MPs are sworn in, which is expected to take place on Saturday.Rahman's family background - his late father was also a leader of Bangladesh - is a reminder that while the BNP have promised change, Rahman, like Hasina, hails from a political dynasty.The absence of both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, who alternated in power over four decades, was one of a number of firsts in this election. Another was that, with the Awami League banned, Jamaat for the first time ran as one of the main parties vying for power. The alliance it leads took 77 seats, six of which went to the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) that was born out of the 2024 protests. The Awami League has questioned the legitimacy of the election given that it was unable to participate, while Jamaat has questioned the way the vote was conducted. Both it and the BNP have accused the other of voting irregularities. For Tarique Rahman, it is a huge change of fortunes. He spent 17 years in self-imposed exile in London before returning to the country five days before his mother's death and is seen by many as largely untested. As well as being on track to become the country's next leader, is also his first time as an MP. He was elected as member for the Dhaka-17 and Bogra-6 constituencies, and is one of 212 successful BNP  candidates, according to the Election Commission, which put voter turnout at 59.44%.During his campaign, Rahman promised that democracy would be restored. Reviving the country's economy, bringing rising food prices under control and creating jobs for Bangladesh's huge young population are the big challenges facing the new government.Repairing strained ties with giant neighbour India is also high up the list of priorities.Within hours of his win, Rahman had received a call from India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi who congratulated him on a \"remarkable victory\".\"As two close neighbours with deep-rooted historical and cultural ties, I reaffirmed India's continued commitment to the peace, progress, and prosperity of both our peoples,\" Modi wrote on X.ReutersBoth the BNP and Jamaat have been criticised by the lack of female political candidates they hadAlthough the BNP are promising to lead change in the country, the party was criticised for corruption and accused of human rights violations when it was last in government in the early 2000s.Rahman himself was subject to various criminal investigations while Sheikh Hasina was in power but was later cleared of all charges.Thursday's democratic exercise is a moment of huge potential - and risk - for the country, with one of its two main parties winning such a big victory. Among the constitutional reforms envisaged are prime ministerial term limits, a directly elected upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and increased judicial independence. Greater representation of women in parliament is also in the charter but only a tiny number of female candidates were successful in the election, showing there is a long way to go.Of the main parties, the BNP fielded 10 female candidates, the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) just two and the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami none.Both the BNP and Jamaat have denied sidelining women, instead claiming the number of those standing is a result of Bangladesh's \"social structure\".One voter, Shima Akhter, was among many women who took part in the student-led protests leading to Hasina's downfall - paving the way for the election - and dismissed this as \"just a patriarchal excuse\".Tarique Rahman will be under great scrutiny to deliver to Akhter and other young people like her who are hungry for change as Bangladesh has one of the youngest demographics in the world.While there may be mixed feelings among some about the election result and concerns over whether the BNP can deliver, Rashna Mahzabin is among those who are happy they got to \"raise their voices\" after years of authoritarian rule. \"That's a huge win,\" she told the BBC.With additional reporting by Azadeh Moshiri and Kathryn Armstrong.

In his address to parliament, Ramaphosa said he had directed the chiefs of the police and army to draw up a plan on where \"our security forces should be deployed within the next few days\". He said the military deployment would start in the provinces of Western Cape and Gauteng, home to the cities of Cape Town and Johannesburg, because of rising gang violence and illegal mining respectively.\"Children here in the Western Cape are caught in the crossfire of gang wars. People are chased out of their homes by illegal miners in Gauteng,\" said Ramaphosa. Authorities blame illegal miners, known as \"zama zamas\", typically armed, undocumented foreign nationals, for their involvement in organised crime syndicates.Ramaphosa ruled out deploying troops to Cape Town just two weeks ago, saying soldiers were trained for combat and not community policing. He did not explain why he changed his mind but there have been increasing calls for him to take action to tackle gang violence.Beyond the military deployment, Ramaphosa announced additional measures to combat crime, including recruiting 5,500 police officers, strengthening intelligence, and targeting crime syndicates.South Africa, the continent's most industrialised nation, has long struggled with entrenched organised crime.Police data shows that an average of 63 people were killed each day between April and September last year.More about South Africa from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

In essence, it says that when women are finally allowed to ascend to the top, it's frequently so they can take the fall.Elected as leader after the most resounding election defeat in the history of the modern Liberal Party and amid internal party chaos, Ley didn't even survive a year.On Friday she was pushed out by Angus Taylor, who argued she didn't have what it takes to turn the opposition's fortunes around. He won a leadership ballot 34 to 17, with Senator Jane Hume elected as his deputy.Ley's backers claim she was never given the chance to succeed, with some saying gender played a role. Her opponents say her demise has nothing to do with that and everything to do with performance.The messy saga has reignited conversations in Australia about its progress towards making its politics look more like its population.'Crisis on every front'Whoever took over as Liberal leader after the Labor landslide in May last year was always going to have a tough job.They had to unify the polarised factions of the party and manage an increasingly toxic relationship with their coalition partner of eight decades, the National Party - a small but vocal and often mutinous cohort of rural MPs.They had to overhaul a policy platform which was comprehensively rejected by voters. And they had to do this while balancing the demands of the more conservative sects of the Coalition with the more progressive desires of voters in the urban areas where they were ravaged at the polls.Then they also had to repair the Liberals' reputation with women, who have deserted them en-masse after a string of allegations of misogyny levelled during the Coaliton's previous term of government, which ended in 2022.\"There was just crisis on every front… it's classic glass cliff,\" says Michelle Ryan, Director of the Global Institute for Women's Leadership and one of the researchers who coined the term.Getty ImagesAngus Taylor has long held leadership ambitionsFrom her very first press conference as leader, Ley was aware of what this looked like.She and her supporters insisted she had been selected exactly for this moment, because she was the right person to lead the Coalition through it.She is a moderate who can appeal to city slickers, yes, but one from a bush electorate who can speak National. She's been in parliament for 20 years and was a cabinet minister for five. With an unusual but impressive resume that includes time as a pilot and a sheep musterer, Ley says she has spent her entire life breaking down barriers, challenging assumptions and making room for herself in places women weren't always welcome.Some critics say the idea of a glass cliff itself is offensive, that it diminishes women's achievements and assumes they can't successfully lead out of a crisis, when in fact many in the community feel women fare better in them.\"As far as political analysis goes, it is just wrong,\" Ley wrote in an op-ed for the Women's Agenda shortly after she took over.\"There is no doubt that all too often women are left to clean up the mess… But when the most successful political party in our nation's history picks a leader, it doesn't do so based on chromosomes.\"I earned my shot.\"Few are saying she didn't. But the Liberal Party famously passed over Julie Bishop in 2018, an electorally popular and long-serving minister who had been the party deputy for 11 years.Getty ImagesMany in the party say Julie Bishop should have been their first female leaderPolitical observers say there was a sense Ley was only keeping the seat warm for Taylor, whose first leadership bid failed by a slim margin after a controversial choice in running mate.The glass cliff phenomenon doesn't paint the true picture of Ley's tenure though, says Niki Savva, a veteran political commentator and former Liberal Party advisor.\"Sometimes I get really impatient with the argument that all this is happening to Ley because she's a woman. She hasn't been given a fair go because she's a woman,\" she tells the BBC.\"Maybe a tiny bit, but that is not the real reason… Sussan Ley is the architect of her own fortunes.\"She promised not to make unilateral calls as leader, which seemingly opened the door to relentless pressure - public and private - from her peers. She promised to listen to the electorate on climate, but facing opposition from the conservative members of the Coalition, rolled back her party's promise to reach net-zero by 2050. And though she played a leading role in pushing the government to hold a royal commission into antisemitism in the wake of the Bondi attack - which she says she's proud of - critics accused her of politicising the tragedy. She also oversaw two short-lived but ugly break-ups between the Liberals and Nationals.\"Political leaders are judged on their performance, not on their gender,\" Liberal Senator, and prominent Taylor backer, James Paterson said on Thursday. \"Newspoll shows she's at negative 39 personal approving approval rating. That is the worst performance of an opposition leader in 23 years.\"The driver behind her abysmal approval rating, Savva says, is her lack of conviction on issues she said she cared about.\"If she had gone out there and staked out her territory, gone out and fought for it, then maybe her position would not be as dire as it is today.\"Ryan, though, argues both things can be true.\"It really isn't about whether Ley is qualified for the job or not… It's not even about her performance in this job,\" Ryan says.\"It's about when is it that the party will put a woman ahead.\"Women still rare at the topJulia Gillard, the nation's first female prime minister, is the only woman aside from Ley to lead one of its two major parties.She said at the end of her misogyny-plagued tenure in 2013: \"Being the first female prime minister does not explain everything about my prime ministership, nor does it explain nothing about my prime ministership.\"It's true that representation in parliament has grown dramatically since Gillard's era – largely driven by her party, Labor, who more than 30 years ago set ambitious quotas, both for selecting female candidates in winnable seats, and promoting them into leadership.While the Coalition party rooms remain about a third female, the Labor caucus is now majority women – 57% – a historic achievement. And there is gender equality in cabinet too.But women are still rare at the very top.Getty ImagesFormer PM Julia Gillard is the only other woman to lead one of Australia's major partiesAnthony Albanese's leadership team is the first from Labor without at least a female deputy since 2001, aside from a three-month blip in 2013. Albanese was part of that woman-less leadership team too.And though Penny Wong is senate leader and foreign minister, women still tend to have more junior cabinet roles or positions in non-cabinet ministries.\"Being able to say we've had a female prime minister, that's great, we've just got to get beyond one,\" Ryan says. \"You have to do it again, and then you have to do it again.\"But over the three decades Labor has used to increase its gender diversity through quotas, doyens of both the Liberal and National parties, even Ley herself, have been arguing they don't need them – to the frustration of many of the women in their ranks.Gender shouldn't matter in politics, they say, something which critics say fails to acknowledge the reality that it long has, and still does.\"Instead of, as a woman, getting out there and arguing for quotas, standing up for them, Ley came out with this line, which I just thought was BS, about being a zealot for getting more women into parliament, but agnostic on quotas,\" Savva says.\"Well, what the hell did that mean? And what did she do about it subsequently? Big fat zero.\"Getty ImagesTeal candidates like Kate Chaney have filled gaps left by the Liberal PartyAnalysts say this reluctance from the Liberals to champion strong female candidates has helped fuel the rise of independents. More than 70% of crossbench MPs in this parliament are women, many of them so-called \"Teal\" candidates who have won in traditionally blue, Liberal seats.Ley, who after the leadership spill announced she would resign from parliament, said there was \"no doubt\" it had been \"a challenging time to lead the party\".\"It is important that the new leader gets clear air, something that is not always afforded to leaders,\" she said, a parting jab at her successor.This episode is unlikely to help resolve the Liberal Party's quandaries.Election post-mortems, as well as consistent feedback from polling and interest groups, point towards the desire for a more diverse Liberal Party that reflects modern Australia, and a more cooperative, stable one.At best, recent events show disorganisation and disunity, commentators say. At worst, they're another show of a stubborn Liberal Party reluctant to learn from its mistakes.",

    "body": "1 hour agoAnna LamcheReutersUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio is due to address the Munich Security Conference on SaturdayUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio has spoken of a defining moment and a \"new era\" as he travels to Europe to give a major speech at the Munich Security Conference.Rubio will lead the US team at the first major global event since President Donald Trump threatened Denmark's sovereignty with a pledge to annex Greenland.French President Emmanuel Macron has insisted Europe must prepare for independence from the US, while Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte stressed that transatlantic bonds were as close and important as ever.The war in Ukraine, tensions with China and a potential nuclear deal between Iran and the US are also on the agenda at the annual security conference, which began on Friday.\"The world is changing very fast right in front of us,\" Rubio told reporters, when asked if his message to Europeans would be more conciliatory than a year ago.\"We live in a new era in geopolitics, and it's going to require all of us to sort of re-examine what that looks like and what our role is going to be.\"At last year's conference, US Vice-President JD Vance attacked Europe, including the UK, for policies on free speech and immigration. His comments triggered a year of unprecedented transatlantic tension.Opening this year's conference, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz appealed directly to the US, saying \"let's repair and revive transatlantic trust together\".He also revealed that \"confidential talks\" were ongoing with Macron on creating a joint European nuclear deterrent.France and the UK are the only two nuclear powers in Europe - but Germany and many other European nations have traditionally relied on the US nuclear umbrella within the Nato alliance for deterrence.Some 50 world leaders are set to attend this year's event, where European defence and the future of the transatlantic relationship will be discussed at a time when  US commitments to Nato have been called into question.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Friday she planned to meet Rubio to discuss the US threats to seize Greenland - Denmark's semi-autonomous territory from its Nato ally.The US threats have been viewed by many European leaders as a watershed moment that has eroded trust with its biggest ally.Ahead of the conference, eight former US ambassadors to Nato and eight former American supreme commanders in Europe issued an open letter calling for Washington to maintain its support for the Western defensive alliance.\"Far from being a charity\", they said Nato was a \"force-multiplier\" that allowed the US to assert its power and influence \"in ways that would be impossible - or prohibitively expensive - to achieve on its own\".The transatlantic relationship has come under increasing strain following the Republican president's introduction of tariffs and a suggestion in the US national security strategy that European nations may not remain \"reliable allies\" in the long term.Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel told the BBC on Friday that he recognised \"the world has changed\" and that he hoped the \"transatlantic bond\" remains \"solid\". Watch key moments from Vance's 2025 speech in MunichRubio is expected to avoid taking Vance's abrasive approach but, when asked if he was planning to be more conciliatory, he said that Europeans \"want to know where we're going, where we'd like to go, where we'd like to go with them\".Macron will also address the conference on Friday, having told the World Economic Forum in Davos last month that now was \"not a time for new imperialism or new colonialism\".After a week of turbulent domestic politics, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will also travel to Munich, where he is expected to hold meetings both Merz and Macron, before addressing the conference on Saturday.Conference chairman Wolfgang Ischinger, in a report ahead of the event, said: \"For generations, US allies were not just able to rely on American power but on a broadly shared understanding of the principles underpinning the international order.\"Today, this appears far less certain, raising difficult questions about the future shape of transatlantic and international co-operation.\"The former German diplomat said the White House's foreign policy \"is already changing the world, and it has triggered dynamics whose full consequences are only beginning to emerge\".Upon arrival in Munich, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the conference would bring \"new steps toward our shared security - that of Ukraine and Europe\".On Friday, Russia and Ukraine announced that a new round of peace talks also involving the US would take place in Geneva on 17-18 February, aimed at bringing Russia's full-scale, four-year invasion to an end. The three countries recently held talks in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), with no apparent breakthrough - though Ukraine and Russia carried out a rare prisoner of war exchange shortly after the meeting.Rubio met Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi at the sidelines of the conference on Friday, as Washington and Beijing seek to ease tensions over a number of issues including trade and tariffs, as well as Taiwan.Last week, China's President Xi Jinping called Taiwan \"the most important issue\" at stake between the US and China during a phone call Trump.Xi also told the US president to be \"prudent\" when supplying weapons to the self-governing island, which Beijing views as a breakaway state it has not ruled out taking by force and which has long been supplied militarily by the US.Iran's nuclear programme - which Tehran maintains is peaceful - is also expected to draw focus in Munich.Trump has threatened military action against Iran if it does not agree a new deal to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons.",

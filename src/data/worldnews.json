    "body": "Australian police have called off a search for a four-year-old boy who has been missing in the outback for almost three weeks, after fresh efforts failed to find any traces of the child.Gus Lamont was last seen playing outside his home on a remote sheep station near Yunta, about 300km (186 miles) from Adelaide, on 27 September.His grandmother left him alone for about half an hour before checking on him, only to find the boy missing, prompting one of the largest land and air searches in South Australian history.Police - who do not suspect foul play - say they will continue investigating, but that the case has become a \"recovery operation\".Last week, authorities briefly wound down the search, only to restart it on Tuesday alongside 80 Australian Defense Force personnel.Commissioner Grant Stevens said authorities were searching a wider area based on updated assessments from survivability, medical and search specialists, rather than any new information.On Friday, police confirmed that the new search had not uncovered any signs of Gus.\"The fact Gus is a small child, the terrain is extremely rugged, harsh and subject to changing weather conditions has made the searching difficult and more challenging for those involved,\" police said in a statement.About 470 sq km - an area roughly twice the size of Edinburgh - has now been covered, and a 12-person taskforce set up earlier this week is expected to continue investigating. Police have not ruled out more searches of the property in the future.Gus, who has been described as an adventurous but shy boy, was last seen wearing a grey hat, light grey long pants, boots and a blue long-sleeve T-shirt featuring a yellow Minion character. Police believe he wandered off. The case has sparked huge interest across Australia, with images of the blond, curly-haired boy featured across local media and speculation running rife online.It prompted police to ask that members of the public stop calling them with their \"opinions\", and appeal for them to source information from credible places.Their warning came after fake AI-generated images of the child spread on social media, which the BBC's Verify team investigated.Police earlier this week said the boy's family remain \"stoic\" despite the tragic circumstances.\"You can imagine just how they are feeling... without having answers as to exactly where Gus is and what's happened to him. This would be traumatic for any family,\" Commissioner Stevens said.Through a spokesperson, the Lamont family has previously said they are \"devastated\" by Gus's disappearance. \"This has come as a shock to our family and friends, and we are struggling to comprehend what has happened,\" Bill Harbison said, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\"Gus's absence is felt in all of us, and we miss him more than words can express.\"",

    "body": "A Taiwanese airline has apologised for requesting paperwork from an employee after her death, in the latest development of a case that has sparked widespread anger.The 34-year-old Eva Air flight attendant, surnamed Sun, died earlier this month after reportedly feeling unwell during a flight.Days after her death, the airline texted her asking for proof that she applied for leave during the time she was in hospital.Ms Sun's death has enraged many online amid speculation that she was overworked. Taiwanese authorities and Eva Air are now investigating whether Ms Sun was denied medical help or discouraged from taking sick leave.In a statement provided to the BBC, Eva Air said that it had maintained contact with her family when she was in hospital and was \"deeply saddened\" by Sun's death.\"The health and safety of our employees and passengers are our highest priorities,\" the airline said, adding it was \"conducting a thorough review\" of the case.Ms Sun reportedly felt ill on 24 September during a flight from Milan to Eva Air's base in Taoyuan City in Taiwan. She was hospitalised upon arrival and eventually died on 8 October.Anonymous social media users claiming to be her colleagues have alleged Ms Sun was pushed to continue working even when she felt unwell.The China Medical University Hospital in Taichung, where she died, has not officially disclosed the cause of her death.Flight records in the last six months showed that Ms Sun had flown an average of 75 hours per month, which is within regulatory limits, Taiwan's Central News Agency (CNA) reported. She joined the airline in 2016.According to Ms Sun's family, days after her death her phone received a text message from an Eva Air representative asking for documents proving that Ms Sun had applied for leave in late September, which was the period she was in hospital.The representative asked her to send in a picture of the leave documents. The family replied the text with a copy of Ms Sun's death certificate.Senior Eva Air officials said the text was a \"mistake by an internal employee\".They told a press conference that they had personally apologised to Ms Sun's family for the error.\"The departure of Ms Sun is the pain in our hearts forever,\" Eva Air President Sun Chia-Ming said. \"We will carry out the investigation [into her death] with the most responsible attitude.\" Since 2013, Eva Air has been fined seven times, mostly for offences related to staff working overtime, CNA said.",

    "body": "John Bolton, Donald Trump's former national security adviser, has pleaded not guilty to charges of mishandling classified information.The 18 charges stem from allegations he shared or retained sensitive materials, including some characterised as top secret. He entered the plea after surrendering to authorities at a federal court hearing on Friday.Bolton served during Trump's first administration but parted with the White House contentiously, and has become one of the president's most vocal public critics.The indictment makes Bolton, 76, the third of the US president's political opponents to face charges in recent weeks. Bolton has said he would defend his \"lawful conduct\".Bolton, wearing a dark blue suit and maroon tie, did not speak with reporters as he arrived at the courthouse in Greenbelt, Maryland.\"Not guilty, your honor,\" Bolton, 76, said in court. He was released on his own recognisance and a hearing in the case is scheduled for 21 November.Prosecutors have accused Bolton of using personal messaging apps and email to illegally transmit sensitive information.\"These documents revealed intelligence about future attacks, foreign adversaries, and foreign-policy relations,\" prosecutors wrote.Bolton said when he was charged that his actions were \"lawful conduct\".He added he had \"become the latest target in weaponizing the Justice Department to charge those he [Trump] deems to be his enemies with charges that were declined before or distort the facts.\"The indictment issued this week accused Bolton of sharing \"diary-like entries\" with two unnamed individuals, and using his personal email account to transmit messages with sensitive materials.The indictment also states that between 2019 and 2021, Bolton was allegedly the target of a hacking attack from a \"cyber actor believed to be associated with the Islamic Republic of Iran\" gained access to his account, exposing the classified materials.\"Like many public officials throughout history, Ambassador Bolton kept diaries – that is not a crime,\" Bolton's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in response to the charges.Lowell described the records in question as \"unclassified, shared only with his immediate family, and known to the FBI as far back as 2021\".An indictment in the US justice system is a formal accusation issued by a grand jury - a group of members of the public set up by a prosecutor to review evidence to determine if a case should proceed.Bolton has been scrutinised for his handling of classified information since 2020, when he sought to publish a book about his time in the first Trump administration.The Justice Department tried to block the book's release, alleging it could contain classified information. A federal judge ruled against the government, but rebuked Bolton in his decision, writing he had \"gambled with the national security of the United States\".An investigation into Bolton continued into the Joe Biden administration, but did not lead to charges.The Federal Bureau of Investigation searched Bolton's house and office in August, signalling an active investigation.Trump has frequently attacked Bolton in social media and criticised him in public statements. In 2020, when Bolton published his book, The Room Where it Happened: A White House Memoir, the president said he \"illegally released much Classified Information\" in the book and called his former adviser a \"lowlife who should be in jail.\"Upon retuning to office, Trump revoked Bolton's security detail this year, along with protection for several other political opponents.Bolton's indictment comes after Trump's Justice Department brought criminal charges against two of his political opponents: former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.",

    "body": "Baek Se-hee, the South Korean author of the bestselling memoir I Want to Die but I Want To Eat Tteokbokki has died at the age of 35.Her 2018 book, a compilation of conversations with her psychiatrist about her depression, was a cultural phenomenon with its themes of mental health resonating with readers across the world.Originally written in Korean, it found international acclaim after its English translation was published in 2022.The details surrounding her death are unclear.Baek donated her organs - her heart, lungs, liver and kidneys - which have helped to save five lives, the Korean Organ Donation Agency said in a statement on Friday.The statement also included comments from her sister, which said that Baek had wanted to \"share her heart with others through her work, and to inspire hope\".I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki, published in 2018, has sold more than a million copies worldwide and been translated in 25 countries.The runaway bestseller was celebrated for normalising mental health conversations and its nuanced take on inner struggles - most notably, the author's personal conflict between depressive thoughts and her appreciation for simple joys.\"The human heart, even when it wants to die, quite often wants at the same time to eat some tteokbokki, too,\" goes the book's most famous line. Tteokbokki, which are tubular chewy rice cakes usually eaten with a spicy sauce or stew, is a popular snack in Korean cuisine.Born in 1990, Baek Se-hee took creative writing in university and worked for five years at a publishing house, according to her short biography on Bloomsbury Publishing, which produced the English version of her 2018 memoir.Anton Hur, who had translated Baek's book into English, wrote on Instagram that her organs have saved five people but \"her readers will know she touched yet millions of lives more with her writing\".\"My thoughts are with her family,\" he wrote.For a decade she received treatment for dysthymia, a mild but long-lasting type of depression, which formed the basis of her bestseller, said her Bloomsbury bio.A sequel, I Want to Die but I Still Want to Eat Tteokbokki, was published in Korean in 2019. Its English translation was published in 2024.Tributes have poured in on social media. \"Rest softly,\" reads a comment on Baek's Instagram page. \"Thank you for saving us with your honesty.\"Another Instagram user said each time they read Baek's memoir they found \"deep comfort in every sentence and grew alongside it\". \"To create a single book that can lift people up... is no easy task, and I have indescribable respect for you for achieving that,\" they wrote.A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line.

    "body": "A US governor took home $1.4m (£1m) in a gambling windfall last year, a copy of his recent tax filing shows.JB Pritzker is reported to have won the sum while playing blackjack at a casino in Las Vegas while on holiday with his wife and friends.The two-term Democrat already has a net worth of $3.9bn (£2.9bn), according to Forbes, and is an heir to the Hyatt Hotel fortune.A campaign spokesperson told CBS, the BBC's partner in the US, that Pritzker planned to donate the money to charity but did not respond when asked why he had not already done so.Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, the Illinois governor described the win and himself as \"incredibly lucky\".\"You have to be to end up ahead, frankly, going to a casino anywhere,\" Pritzker added.He previously founded a charitable Chicago Poker Challenge which he says has \"raised millions of dollars\" for the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center.Pritzker and his wife, Mary Kathryn, reported a total income of $10.6m (£7.8m) in 2024, mostly from dividends and capital gains. It's understood they paid $1.6m in taxes on taxable income of $5.87m.He described his Sin City winnings as a \"net number\" across his trip. He declined to say what his winning hand was, according to CBS.\"Anybody who's played cards in a casino knows, you often play for too long and lose whatever it is you won,\" Pritzker said. \"I was fortunate enough to have to leave before that happened.\"The governor has emerged as one of US President Donald Trump's strongest critics of late, clashing with the president over the federal deployment of national troops to Chicago - actions which he called \"authoritarian\".Trump called for the jailing of the Illinois official, accusing him and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson of not doing enough to ensure the safety of federal immigration officers who are conducting raids in Chicago. Pritzker intends to seek a third term in the governor's mansion in 2026, it is understood, and has deflected questions about any ambition beyond his current position.",

    "body": "2 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorGAVRIIL GRIGOROV/POOL/AFPPutin flew to Alaska in his specially modified Il-96 plane in AugustThe summit has not been set in stone, but if Russia's Vladimir Putin does go to Budapest to meet US President Trump in the next two weeks, he would need to clear a few hurdles first.When Putin travelled to Alaska for his Anchorage summit in August, the US granted special permission for the presidential plane - a modified Ilyushin Il-96 airliner dubbed the \"Flying Kremlin\" that has four engines and is bristling with defence systems.Russian planes are banned from US air space, and from EU air space too. So if Putin does fly to Budapest he would need special dispensation if he decided to fly over an EU member state.It is perfectly possible, but landlocked Hungary is not the easiest destination to get to for a Russian president who rarely sets foot abroad and has not travelled to the EU for years.\"For now, of course, it's not clear,\" says Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. \"What we do have is the willingness of the presidents to hold such a meeting.\"Days after Putin ordered Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the EU froze the assets of both its leader and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.A blanket ban was also imposed on all Russian aircraft flying through the airspace of all 27 EU countries. Hungary and many of its neighbours are Nato member states too.Putin has also been accused by the International Criminal Court of war crimes of unlawfully deporting and transferring of Ukrainian children to Russia.So there are complications, although Hungary believes they can all be sorted out. Hungary is in the process of pulling out of the ICC anyway.Putin and Hungary's Viktor Orban, probably his closest ally in the EU, have already discussed the planned summit over the phone, and Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has told reporters \"we will of course ensure that he can enter Hungary, hold successful talks here, and then return home\".Getty ImagesHungary's Viktor Orban is one of Putin's closest allies in the EUThe EU is unlikely to create obstacles either.Its executive commission has said any meeting that moves forward \"a just and lasting peace for Ukraine\" is welcome and it supports President Trump's efforts towards that.One of the main drivers for its latest proposed sanctions on Russia - the 19th package so far - is to bring the Russians to the negotiating table, it says. And it points out there's no travel ban on Putin, only an asset freeze.The biggest sticking point is how Russia's leader will fly from Moscow to Budapest. Clearly he will not be buying an Air Serbia ticket to Belgrade and catching the train to Hungary, which may be the most direct route to take.He will want his Il-96 plane to guarantee his safety, but that will probably mean using the air space of an EU and Nato member state and obtaining permission to break the EU's ban on Russian planes.European Commission spokeswoman Anitta Hipper said on Friday that \"in terms of the direction of travel, member states can give derogations but it must be given by member states individually\".Nato has also referred the issue to respective national authorities, and as Trump is involved they may acquiesce.Even with dispensation, a look at the map shows Putin may have to take a circuitous route. Ukraine is out of the question, and probably Poland too because of Warsaw's icy relations with Moscow.Perhaps the most direct route goes via the eastern coast of the Black Sea and Turkey, through Bulgaria and either Serbia or Romania into Hungary.Serbia's president, Aleksandar Vucic, knows Putin well and Air Serbia has direct flights to Moscow over EU airspace. Serbia is a candidate to join the EU but is not a member.It is the EU countries, Bulgaria or perhaps Romania, that would need to give consent, and they would have to escort Putin's plane through their airspace.Romania has what is set to become the biggest Nato base in Europe, and Bulgaria is also building a Nato base as part of efforts to shore up the defensive alliance's eastern flank.The BBC has approached the foreign ministries of both countries for comment.If Putin wants to play it even more safely, he could fly via Turkey, around the south coast of Greece and then up through Montenegrin airspace before going over Serbia. But it is a far longer route.Anadolu via Getty ImagesPutin's Ilyushin plane has been dubbed the \"Flying Kremlin\"Budapest is not then the easiest of venues, even if it works very well for Viktor Orban, who has long had good relations with both Putin and Donald Trump.\"It's a leader that we like,\" said Trump on Friday, \"he likes him, I like him.\"A high-profile international summit will do Orban no harm at all, as he is trailing in the polls before elections next spring.Within hours of Budapest being named as a venue, Orban was on the phone to Putin and declared on his Facebook page: \"Preparations are in full swing!\"Orban has little time for the EU's backing of Ukraine and he was quick to make clear Brussels would have nothing to do with the talks.\"Since the EU is pro-war, it is logical that it will be left out of this peace process,\" he told Hungarian radio on Friday.European leaders will have other ideas when they see him at next week's summit in Brussels next week.",

    "body": "EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has said a new anti-drone system should be \"fully operational by the end of 2027\", as part of a drive to toughen defences against Russia and be fully prepared for possible conflict by 2030.\"Drones are already redefining warfare. Having drone defences is no longer optional for anyone,\" Kallas said, referring to Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and fears that Moscow may attack the EU.The European Commission's \"defence roadmap\" also proposes strengthening the EU's eastern borders and building air and space \"shields\".Several EU nations have faced Russian incursions into their airspace and US President Donald Trump has urged the bloc to do more to defend itself.The European defence plan comes amid growing European fears that Russia will continue its westward aggression after the war in Ukraine is over, as well as continued ambiguity over Trump's long-term commitment to European security.\"Danger will not disappear even when the war in Ukraine ends. It is clear we need to toughen our defences against Russia,\" Kallas told reporters in Brussels on Thursday.Although there seems little chance of the war ending soon, Trump says he is now having a \"lengthy\" conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the phone, ahead of talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday. Trump has indicated that if Putin does not not move to end the war, the US could send Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles - a potential move already described as \"escalation\" by the Kremlin.Standing alongside Kallas, European Defence Commissioner Andrius Kubilius stressed that \"our roadmap shows all the major milestones to achieve defence readiness by 2030, so we can deter Russian aggression, prevent war and preserve peace\".Putin has repeatedly denied that Moscow has any aggressive plans towards the EU. In June, he said the \"myth that Russia is planning to attack Europe, Nato countries is an unbelievable lie... nonsense\".The EU's executive Commission said the 27-member union should be ready by 2030 to \"respond to any crisis, including high-intensity conflict\".It also urged the bloc to \"close critical capability gaps\" - including in air and missile defence, and artillery systems - \"through joint development and procurement\".Many EU countries are also members of Nato and its chief, Mark Rutte, said they were working together to protect member states on the eastern flank from aerial threat.The EU stressed its \"flagship\" projects would be developed in \"close co-ordination\" with Nato, and would not duplicate the Western defensive alliance's work.No estimates were given to the overall cost, but Kubilius said \"we're not talking here about hundreds of billions\".The \"defence roadmap\" still needs to be approved by member states at a leaders' summit next week. However, a number of EU states have already backed plans for a multi-layered \"drone wall\" to quickly detect, then track and destroy Russian drones.In recent weeks,  tensions have escalated between the EU and Russia, after Poland and Romania - both Nato members - said Russian drones had breached their airspace.And Estonia - another Nato member - in September requested urgent consultations  with other alliance members after saying that Russian warplanes had violated its airspace and stayed there for 12 minutes.Russia, which launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, said its planes were on a \"scheduled flight... in strict compliance with international airspace regulations and did not violate the borders of other states\".A number of European politicians and military experts have said that Russia's aim is to test Nato's capabilities and and try to sow discord within the alliance. Several Nato members reacted to the reported Russian incursions by sending troops, artillery, and air defence systems to secure the alliance's eastern flank.",

    "body": "8 minutes agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent in WarsawOmar Marques/Getty ImagesVolodymyr Zhuravlyov was released after the judge delivered his verdictA Polish judge has refused to extradite a Ukrainian citizen – suspected by Germany of sabotaging the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September 2022 – arguing that if Ukraine was responsible for the attack, then it was a \"just\" act.Volodymyr Zhuravlyov, who was brought to Warsaw District Court in handcuffs, was detained in Poland last month on a European arrest warrant.Judge Dariusz Lubowski ordered his release, after a ruling that was met with a ripple of surprise from the crowd in court and a smile from the man in the dock.Mr Zhuravlyov, along with others, is suspected of planting explosives deep beneath the Baltic Sea on the pipelines leading from Russia to Germany.Blame for the blasts, which crippled a long-controversial energy supply line from Russia to Germany, initially focused on Moscow until signs of Ukrainian involvement began to emerge. Officials in Kyiv have repeatedly denied any role.Extradition cases within the EU are usually quick and straightforward, but the Nord Stream case is proving to be very different.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, whose government is a key ally of war-torn Ukraine, immediately posted on X that the ruling was right. \"Case closed,\" he wrote.Diver held in Poland over Russian pipeline blasts in Baltic SeaUkrainian held in Italy over Nord Stream gas pipelines blast mysteryInside the giant district courthouse in Warsaw, Judge Lubowski announced his decision to the suspect, his family and legal team – and a large cluster of TV cameras.In a long and passionate speech, he said he was considering only the request to send Mr Zhuravlyov to Germany, not the substance of the case itself. But he was clear that the context of the war in Ukraine was critical.The judge described Russia's invasion as \"a bloody and genocidal attack\" and argued, quoting Aristotle and Saint Thomas Aquinas, saying that Ukraine had the legal right to defend itself.\"If Ukraine and its special forces… organised an armed mission to destroy enemy pipelines – which the court does not prejudge – then these actions were not unlawful. \"On the contrary, they were justified, rational and just,\" he told the court.BBC/Sarah RainsfordMr Zhuravlyov's wife, Yulianna, said it was important to hear the judge understood UkrainiansHe said the attack had \"deprived the enemy of billions of euros paid by Germany for the gas… and weakened Russia's military potential\".What could be seen as terrorism or sabotage in peace time, the judge said, was different in a time of war.Germany had in fact halted use of the two Nord Stream 1 pipelines after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Nord Stream 2 had not yet entered service.Poland has always been a vocal critic of that project for making Berlin too dependent on Moscow. The route deprived Poland of transit fees for the gas. Ukraine and the US were also longstanding opponents of the pipelines.Judge Lubowski insisted, though, that his ruling was a legal one, and not emotional or political. He also questioned whether Germany had jurisdiction even to bring its case, as the explosions were in international waters on pipelines with majority Russian state ownership.Announcing that Mr Zhuravlyov would be released from custody, he said the Ukrainian would also get compensation from the Polish state.\"I am happy… it was a really very hard three weeks,\" Mr Zhuravlyov's wife, Yulianna, told the BBC in court after the judge's verdict.\"For me, as a Ukrainian, it was very important to hear that he understands us.\"She said the family planned to stay in Poland, where they have lived since February 2022.Earlier, she described her husband's arrest at their home just outside Warsaw and said he denied any involvement in the sabotage.Volodymyr Zhuravlyov is a deep-sea diver, his wife has confirmed, but she called it a hobby and said he had no military role. He has a business in Poland installing air conditioners. Mrs Zhuravlyova could not tell the BBC exactly where her husband was when three of the four Nord Stream pipelines were blown up, because she said no-one had asked her to check.He is not the only suspect on Germany's list: another Ukrainian man was detained in Italy in August when he was on holiday. Serhiy Kuznetsov was also accused of \"unconstitutional sabotage\" and has denied any connection to the blasts. He is currently in a high security prison in northern Italy.A court in Bologna did rule he should be extradited to Berlin but earlier this week that verdict was annulled by the top appeals court in Rome and the case has been returned to Bologna to begin all over again.Asked about the decision, Germany's foreign minister said he respected the ruling and it was not the job of government to interfere with the courts.",

    "body": "Prosecutors in Bangladesh have demanded that former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina be put to death over a deadly crackdown on student-led protests last year that ousted her from power.Hasina, who has fled to India, is on trial for crimes against humanity. According to a leaked audio clip, she ordered security forces to \"use lethal weapons\" against protesters. She denies the charges.Up to 1,400 people were killed in weeks of unrest that ended Hasina's 15-year rule. It was the worst violence Bangladesh had seen since its 1971 war of independence.Chief prosecutor Tajul Islam said Hasina deserves 1,400 death sentences. \"Since that is not humanly possible, we demand at least one,\" he said.\"[Hasina's] goal was to cling to power permanently, for herself and her family,\" Islam told the court on Thursday. \"She has turned into a hardened criminal and shows no remorse for the brutality she has committed,\" he said.The protests started in July 2024 against civil service job quotas for relatives of those who fought in the 1971 war but soon escalated into a mass movement to overthrow Hasina. Some of the bloodiest scenes occurred on 5 August, the day Hasina fled by helicopter before crowds stormed her residence in Dhaka, a BBC investigation found.Police killed at least 52 people that day in a busy Dhaka neighbourhood, making it one of the worst cases of police violence in Bangladesh's history.Hasina's state-appointed defence lawyer argues that the police were forced to open fire in response to violent actions from the protesters.Hasina is being tried alongside her ex-interior minister, Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, and former police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun. Prosecutors have sought the death penalty for Kamal, who is also in hiding. Chowdhury pleaded guilty in July but has not been handed a sentence.Hasina has already been sentenced to six months in prison for contempt of court, and separately faces corruption charges.Bangladesh is due hold its next elections in February, which will see Hasina's rival party BNP as frontrunner in the vote. Her party Awami League has been banned from all activities, including participating in elections.",

    "body": "19 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterReutersLast week, China's Ministry of Commerce published a document that went by the name of \"announcement No. 62 of 2025\".But this wasn't just any bureaucratic missive. It has rocked the fragile tariffs truce with the US.The announcement detailed sweeping new curbs on its rare earth exports, in a move that tightens Beijing's grip on the global supply of the critical minerals - and reminded Donald Trump just how much leverage China holds in the trade war.China has a near-monopoly in the processing of rare earths - crucial for the production of everything from smartphones to fighter jets.Under the new rules, foreign companies now need the Chinese government's approval to export products that contain even a tiny amount of rare earths and must declare their intended use.In response, US President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods and put export controls on key software.\"This is China versus the world. They have pointed a bazooka at the supply chains and the industrial base of the entire free world, and we're not going to have it,\" said US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.On Thursday, China said the US had \"deliberately provoked unnecessary misunderstanding and panic\" over the rare earths restrictions.\"Provided the export licence applications are compliant and intended for civilian use, they will be approved,\" a commerce ministry spokesperson added.This week, the world's two biggest economies also imposed new port fees on each other's ships.The flare-up in the trade war brings to an end months of relative calm after top US and Chinese officials brokered a truce in May.Later this month, Trump and China's President Xi Jinping are expected to meet and experts have told the BBC the rare earths restrictions will give China the upper hand.China's new controls are bound to \"shock the system\" as they target vulnerabilities in American supply chains, said international business lecturer Naoise McDonagh from Australia's Edith Cowan University.\"The timing has really upset the kind of timeline for negotiations that the Americans wanted,\" he added.Getty ImagesRare earth minerals are crucial for the production of fighter jets like the F-35Rare earth minerals are essential for the production of a whole range of technology such as solar panels, electric cars and military equipment.For example, a single F-35 fighter jet is estimated to need more than 400kg (881.8lb) of rare earths for its stealth coatings, motors, radars and other components.China's rare earth exports also account for around 70% of the world's supply of metals used for magnets in electric vehicle motors, said Natasha Jha Bhaskar from advisory firm the Newland Global Group.Beijing has worked hard to gain its dominance of the global rare earth processing capacity, said critical minerals researcher Marina Zhang from the University of Technology Sydney.The country has nurtured a vast talent pool in the field, while its research and development network is years ahead of its competitors, she added.While the US and other countries are investing heavily to develop alternatives to China for supplies of rare earths, they are still some way from achieving that goal.With its own large deposits of rare earths, Australia has been tipped as a potential challenger to China. But its production infrastructure is still underdeveloped, making processing relatively expensive, Ms Zhang said.\"Even if the US and all its allies make processing rare earths a national project, I would say that it will take at least five years to catch up with China.\"The new restrictions expand measures Beijing announced in April that caused a global supply crunch, before a series of deals with Europe and the US eased the shortages.The latest official figures from China show that exports of the critical minerals were down in September by more than 30% compared to a year ago.But analysts say China's economy is unlikely to be hurt by the drop in exports.Rare earths make up a very small part of China's $18.7tn a year economy, said Prof Sophia Kalantzakos from New York University.Some estimates put the value of the exports at less than 0.1% of China's annual gross domestic product (GDP).While rare earths' economic value to China may be tiny their strategic value \"is huge\", she said, as they give Beijing more leverage in talks with the US.Despite accusing China of \"betrayal\", Bessent has left the door open to negotiations.\"I believe China is open to discussion and I am optimistic this can be de-escalated,\" he said.During a meeting with the US private equity group Blackstone's chief executive Stephen Schwarzman on Thursday, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi also highlighted the need for talks.\"The two sides should engage in effective communication, properly resolve differences and promote stable, healthy and sustainable development of China-US relations,\" Wang said, according to the ministry's website.What China has done recently is \"getting its ducks in a row\" ahead of those trade talks with the US, said Prof Kalantzakos.In curbing rare earth exports, Beijing has found its \"best immediate lever\" to pressure Washington for a favourable deal, Ms Bhaskar said.Getty ImagesTop US officials Scott Bessent and Jamieson Greer blasted China as \"unreliable\"Jiao Yang from Singapore Management University believes that although Beijing holds the cards in the short-run, Washington does have some strategic options at its disposal.The US could offer to lower tariffs, which is likely to be attractive to Beijing as the trade war has hit its manufacturers hard, said Prof Jiao said.China's economy is reliant on the income from the goods it makes and exports. The latest official figures show its exports to the US were down by 27% compared to a year ago.Washington can also threaten to hit China with more trade restrictions to hamper efforts to develop its technology sector, said Prof McDonagh.For example, the White House has already targeted China's need for high-end semiconductors by blocking its purchases of Nvidia's most advanced chips.But experts say that is likely to have only limited effects.Measures targeting Beijing's tech industry may slow China but won't \"stop it dead in the water,\" said Prof McDonagh.China has shown with its recent economic strategy that it is willing to take some pain to achieve its long-term goals, he added.\"China can carry on even if it costs a lot more under US export controls.\"But if China cuts off these rare earth supplies, that can actually stop everyone's industry. That's the big difference.\"",

    "body": "1 day agoHugh SchofieldIn ParisAFP via Getty ImagesSébastien Lecornu has had a turbulent start to his job, having resigned last week as prime minister before being reappointedFrance's new prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, has bought himself breathing space after winning two no-confidence motions tabled by the opposition.In the tightest vote, a motion sponsored by the far left fell 18 votes short of the 289 needed to bring him down. It means that after just five days in office, Lecornu has survived a first major ordeal in parliament and can now focus on the task of passing the 2026 budget.Any relief for the prime minister is likely to be short-lived, with the far left and far right still gunning to bring him down. And the Socialists, who threw a lifeline in the no-confidence motions, have made clear they will not be so indulgent next time round.Also, any tactical victory enabling the government to endure for now is more than offset by the huge damage to France's reputation caused by weeks of confusion and capitulation.Appointed by President Emmanuel Macron four weeks ago, then re-appointed in chaotic scenes on Friday after he resigned on Monday, Lecornu only survives thanks to major concessions made to the left.To buy the support of the Socialist Party, which has 65 or so MPs, the prime minister promised to freeze Macron's most important economic reform of his second term – the raising of the retirement age to 64.But he also made another, possibly more important, gift to the opposition, which has big implications for the chances of obtaining a budget in time for the end-of-year deadline.By pledging not to resort to the constitutional device known as the 49:3 – which lets governments force through laws without a vote – Lecornu handed ultimate control over the budget to the parties in parliament.It is a huge shift in power, reflecting the decline of presidential authority since Macron's botched parliamentary dissolution of July 2024.  For many observers  it heralds a return, for good or ill, to the party politicking that was a hallmark of the pre-1958 Fourth Republic.By assuring MPs that they and not the government would have the last word on the future budget, Lecornu managed to convince the Socialists that he was serious about marking a real \"rupture\" from previous Macronite administrations.But he may also have surrendered any prospect of the kind of belt-tightening debt reduction that the money markets and the European Union are demanding.The draft budget tabled by Lecornu on Tuesday aims to reduce the deficit to 4.7% of economic output (GDP) by making savings of €30bn (£26bn), with a squeeze on spending in the health sector and local administration.But the Socialists have joined the rest of the left and the far-right in denouncing the text as a betrayal of the less well-off.   Party leader Olivier Faure said that he would have no compunction about supporting a new vote of censure, if offending parts of the budget are not removed.AFP via Getty ImagesMathilde Panot's radical-left France Unbowed sponsored one of the two failed no-confidence motionsFrance's National Assembly has been split three ways for the last 15 months, with a centre-right bloc of under 200 MPs facing a left-wing alliance of about the same size and a far-right bloc of about 140, plus some independents.  None of the three prime ministers since then has been able to find a reliable majority.Weeks of bickering in Paris have triggered warnings about the public's growing disillusionment with politics - the spectacle appearing to confirm the notion that the prime aim of most politicians is simply to stay in power.President Macron, who is blamed for the crisis by most French voters, has seen his popularity ratings slump to just 14%. He has been in office for eight years, and the far right and far left have called for his resignation before his second term ends in 18 months.According to his one-time adviser, the veteran essayist and confidant of presidents Alain Minc, Macron \"must now go down as the worst president of the Fifth Republic\".Minc said Macron had come to office promising to act as a bulwark against the far right but he had left National Rally at the gates of power.\"If you look around us,\" said Minc, \"the Germans are petrified about what a French collapse will do to the economy. The British are petrified about the strategic implications. The Italians are laughing at us, because we always laughed at them.\"\"In America, President Trump is saying that smooth-talker Macron has got what he deserves. Only in Russia are they smiling.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoSean SeddonEPABenjamin Netanyahu addressed a memorial ceremony at the Mount Herzl cemetery in JerusalemIsrael's prime minister has told a memorial for victims of the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023 that he is \"determined\" to secure the return of the dead hostages still in Gaza, and that the country will continue to fight terrorism with \"full force\".Benjamin Netanyahu made the comments hours after Hamas returned the bodies of two more hostages but said it was not able to access the remaining 19.There has been fury in Israel that Hamas has not returned all the bodies in line with last week's Gaza ceasefire deal, though the US has downplayed the suggestion it amounts to a breach.Hamas said later it remained committed to the ceasefire, including \"keenness to hand over all remaining corpses\".In a statement, it accused Netanyahu of impeding its ability to search for hostages' remains by not allowing heavy machinery and diggers into the Gaza Strip.The group is continuing to try to recover captives' bodies. In footage broadcast on Al Jazeera, Hamas gunmen appear to guard bulldozers digging in the dark in the southern city of Khan Younis. The BBC understands that Hamas has given mediators coordinates and aerial photographs of bodies' locations.US President Donald Trump meanwhile has signalled he was willing to see fighting resume if Hamas \"continues to kill people\", seemingly referencing reports of violence inside Gaza, where Hamas has been accused of violently targeting internal rivals in recent days.Writing on his Truth Social platform, the US president said \"we will have no choice but to go in and kill\" if the group did not desist. Trump has previously ruled out putting American soldiers on the ground in Gaza.Earlier on Thursday, the Israeli government confirmed that two bodies handed over by Hamas to the International Committee of the Red Cross on Wednesday night had been identified as Inbar Hayman and Sgt Maj Muhammad al-Atarash.Their return, which was overseen by masked Hamas gunmen in Gaza City, took the number of dead hostages returned since Monday to nine out of 28. All 20 living hostages were released on Monday, in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has responded to the delay in returning all the bodies by threatening to restrict the amount of aid flowing into Gaza.On Thursday, Netanyahu addressed an official memorial ceremony at the Mount Herzl national cemetery in Jerusalem, two days after the Hebrew calendar anniversary of the 7 October attack.The prime minister said he remained committed to securing the return of all the dead Israeli and foreign hostages, and reiterated his government's willingness to return to military action if Israel was attacked again.He said: \"Our fight against terrorism will continue with full force. We will not allow evil to raise its head. We will exact the full price from anyone who harms us.\"The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 67,967 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.ReutersIsraeli Bedouin soldier Sgt Maj Muhammad al-Atarash was buried on Thursday, a day after his body was returned by HamasThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel said Netanyahu's government should \"immediately halt the implementation\" of the ceasefire deal until the 19 bodies were returned. After Hamas said it was unable to retrieve all the bodies, two senior advisers to US President Donald Trump said preparations to move to the next phase of the ceasefire deal were continuing. The advisers told reporters that the US government did not so far believe Hamas had broken the agreement by not retrieving more remains, and said the group had acted in good faith by sharing information with interlocutors.While the full text of the agreement between Israel and Hamas has not been made public, a leaked version which appeared in Israeli media appeared to allow for the possibility that not all of the bodies would be immediately accessible. One senior US adviser pointed to the level of destruction in Gaza as one reason the search might be slowed, and said rewards could be offered to civilians with information about the location of remains. Hamas has complained to mediators that more than 20 people have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza since the ceasefire took effect on Friday.Israel's military, which still controls more than half the territory, has said that it opens fire to remove threats to its troops.Watch: Netanyahu responds to Trump comment that he’s not \"the easiest\" to work withMeanwhile in Gaza, work is under way to identify the bodies of Palestinians returned by Israel in recent days in exchange for the hostages' bodies. A further 30 were returned on Thursday, taking the total to 120.There had been some reports that the Rafah crossing with Egypt would reopen on Thursday, having been shut since the Gaza side was seized by Israeli forces in May 2024.The ceasefire deal specifies its reopening would be \"subject to the same mechanism implemented\" during a temporary ceasefire earlier this year, when wounded Palestinians were briefly allowed to pass through to receive medical treatment.On Thursday, an official from Israeli military body Cogat said: \"The date for the opening of the Rafah crossing for the movement of people only will be announced at a later stage, once the Israeli side, together with the Egyptian side, completes the necessary preparations.\"The official also stressed that \"aid will not pass through the Rafah crossing\". Instead, they said, it would continue to enter Gaza through the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing in southern Israel and other crossings following Israeli security inspections.",

    "body": "Five takeaways from NYC mayoral debate as Mamdani and Cuomo clash 7 hours agoKayla EpsteinRockefeller Center,Grace Eliza GoodwinRockefeller Center andSakshi VenkatramanWatch: Sliwa, Mamdani and Cuomo debate grocery bills, Trump and Gaza The three leading candidates for New York City mayor took the stage at Rockefeller Center in Manhattan on Thursday to make a case to lead America's biggest city.They tangled over housing, Israel and Gaza, and President Donald Trump, with frontrunner Zohran Mamdani pressing main competitor Andrew Cuomo during the heated two-hour debate. With early voting set to begin next week, neither dominated the evening - though both declared victory afterwards. The most recent polling suggests Mamdani has widened his lead to 46%, while Cuomo stands at 33%. The outcome could have political implications beyond the Empire State as Trump looms large, and whoever wins will likely face pressure from Washington in some form.The Democratic Party nationally is likely watching to see if the America's biggest Democratic stronghold chooses an establishment, centrist figure in Cuomo - who is running as an independent - or the progressive Mamdani.Republicans also will watch to see if their candidate, Curtis Sliwa, continues to make inroads with his public safety platform.Here are five big takeaways from the night.1. Mamdani pressed on views on PalestiniansMamdani's past statements on Israel and Palestinians came up several times during the night in questions from moderators and opponents' criticisms.The candidate has stressed his support for Palestinians and statehood, and has fiercely criticised Israel's military operation in Gaza.He also was criticised by Cuomo for declining to condemn the phrase \"globalise the intifada\". Many Jews argue this slogan is an antisemitic call for violence, but pro-Palestinian activists say it refers to a call for international solidarity with Palestinians.\"Why wouldn't he condemn Hamas? Why wouldn't he condemn Hasan Piker?\" said Cuomo, referring to the left-wing political commentator and streamer, who once said \"America deserved 9/11\".In response, Mamdani said: \"I want to be very clear; the occupation is a reference to international law and the violation of it.\"And he added that the comments by Mr Piker - who he sat with for an interview on Youtube earlier this year - \"objectionable and reprehensible\". Pressed by moderators on whether he could reassure voters concerned about his past comments, Mamdani said he would seek to serve as a mayor for all New Yorkers, including its large and ideologically diverse Jewish population.But Cuomo attacked Mamdani for his views, calling the New York state assemblyman a \"divisive personality across the board\".Angelina Katsanis/Pool via REUTERS2. The fourth man: Donald TrumpThere were three candidates at tonight's debate but a fourth name kept coming up: Donald Trump.The president has implied he wants to send the National Guard into cities controlled by Democrats and has moved to withhold government funds for infrastructure projects in New York City. Trump has also prioritised the city for his mass deportation policy, and the mayor — who has little power over federal immigration enforcement — will likely have to weigh the city's response. Sliwa, the Republican, noted that the mayor would need to get along with Trump regardless of political views. But Mamdani made his opposition to the president explicit from his very first response, promising to \"take on Trump\".Cuomo, meanwhile, positioned himself as the only candidate experienced enough to deal with the current White House, warning \"it will be Mayor Trump\" if Mamdani is elected.\"I fought Donald Trump,\" he told voters. \"When I'm fighting for New York, I am not going to stop.\"3. Affordability front and centreAs large as Trump looms, the biggest policy issue around this mayoral election is affordability. New Yorkers face high costs of living on everything - especially rent and groceries.In his opening statement, Sliwa acknowledged the \"really serious issues of affordability\" facing the city. He called for the next mayor to free up vacant apartments in NYCHA - New York's public housing programme — and allow people to move in.The moderators directly asked each candidate how much they paid for rent, groceries and whether they paid off credit card debt monthly. The candidates pitched a volley of proposals to tackle the cost of living, including Mamdani's plan to make buses free and Cuomo's proposal to place income limits on people who resided in rent-stabilised apartments.Cuomo criticised Mamdani for living in a rent-stabilised apartment -a form of affordable housing - even though his parents are wealthy (his mother is the filmmaker Mira Nair).Cuomo also opposed Mamdani's proposed rent freeze on stabilised apartments, saying it would only postpone future increases, force building owners into bankruptcy, and fail New Yorkers who don't live in rent-stabilised apartments.\"If you think that the problem in this city is that my rent is too low, vote for him,\" Mamdani said in response. \"If you know the problem in this city is that your rent is too high, vote for me.\"Former Governor Andrew Cuomo announces run for New York City mayorFULL COVERAGE: Mamdani, Cuomo, Sliwa debateWho is Zohran Mamdani?How Mamdani stunned New York - and what Democrats can learn from his win4. Cuomo's controversies still loomCuomo touted his decades of experience in office, rising from federal housing secretary during President Bill Clinton's administration to New York governor.However, controversies surrounding his governorship have shadowed his campaign. He resigned as governor in 2021 after an investigation by the state attorney general found he had sexually harassed 11 women. Cuomo apologised for acting \"in a way that made people feel uncomfortable\" but denied allegations.The New York attorney general also investigated his administration for undercounting nursing home deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic, finding he understated the actual number of deaths.Mamdani attacked Cuomo on these matters, accusing him of \"sending seniors to their death in nursing homes\", and accused him of lacking integrity.Cuomo said the allegations about harming seniors in nursing homes were \"totally false\".\"During Covid, everyone did whatever they could in this state, and there have been numerous investigations where they've gone through it, and they said we followed federal guidance,\" Cuomo said. \"But yes, people died during Covid. And my heart breaks for everyone that broken, that died in this state and across this nation.\"Sliwa, too, attacked Cuomo for the \"lawsuits filed against you for sexual harassment\". The former governor rebutted that the case brought by New York State Attorney General Letitia James, who investigated the misconduct claims, \"was political\".5. Curtis Sliwa makes his markSliwa held his own as the only Republican on stage. His voting bloc might be in the minority in New York City, but the 2024 presidential election revealed that residents prioritise public safety issues and Sliwa hammered that repeatedly. As the founder of the Guardian Angels, a New York City organization devoted to crime prevention, he seized the opportunity to connect with voters.The longtime New York media and political personality knew how to make himself heard. He frequently interjected, telling moderators he wanted to speak, and elbowing his way into the debate's most heated moments. From centre stage, he took swings at both opponents in equal measure.He felt confident after the debate, saying his night went \"extraordinarily well\" and likening his opponents to \"two kids in the schoolyard\".Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

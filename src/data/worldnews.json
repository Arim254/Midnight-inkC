    "body": "1 day agoMengchen Zhang, Jack Lau and Ankur ShahBBC Global China Unit and Eye InvestigationsBBCWarning: This report contains details of physical and sexual abuse and discussion of suicide.Baobao's heart still races when she smells soil after morning rain.It takes her back to early military drills behind locked gates - and the constant fear that marked every one of her days at Lizheng Quality Education School.For six months, aged 14, she barely left the red and white building in a remote Chinese village where instructors tried to \"fix\" young people whose families considered them rebellious or problematic.Students who failed to comply were beaten so severely they could not sleep on their backs or sit down for days, she says.\"Every single moment was agonising,\" says Baobao, now 19 and speaking under a pseudonym for fear of retribution.She says she considered suicide, and knows other students who attempted it.'Raped and beaten'A BBC Eye investigation has uncovered multiple allegations of physical abuse in the school and others in the same network, and cases of young people being abducted and taken to the institutions.Corporal punishment has been banned in China for decades, but we have collated testimony from 23 former students who say they were beaten or forced to do extreme amounts of exercise. One says she was raped, and two others, including Baobao, say they were sexually assaulted or harassed, all by instructors.Undercover filming has exposed how staff pose as authorities to forcibly transfer young people to their institutions.Thirteen students say they were abducted, with parental consent, by employees pretending to be police or officials.The accounts - from interviews by the BBC World Service, statements gathered by activists, police reports and state media - relate to five schools. These are part of a network of at least 10 schools, all of which have been run by - or have close links to - a military veteran called Li Zheng.Baobao says every single moment at the school was \"agonising\"The centres are part of a booming industry promising anxious parents that military-style discipline will resolve concerns over young people's disobedience, internet addiction, teenage dating and depression, as well as gender and sexual identity. Some parents even send over-18s, who are legally adults.A series of abuse allegations have made headlines in China in recent years, in both Li Zheng schools and others.In a few cases, arrests have been made or institutions shut down, but schools can be quick to reopen with different names or in different locations because the sector has been difficult to regulate. The BBC understands that Mr Li was arrested earlier this year, but we have discovered his associates have recently opened a new school.Companies and individuals involved in the network could either not be reached or declined to comment. The Chinese embassy in the UK told the BBC all educational institutions are required to comply with regulations.'Deeply offensive' body searchBaobao says her mother took her to the Lizheng Quality Education School in Hunan province when she began skipping classes, triggering rows which made their already difficult relationship worse.Her mother left while she was being shown around the school, she says, and she then realised she was not allowed to leave: \"They said if I behaved well, I might be able to get out.\"Baobao initially tried to kick and punch the instructors, she says, but decided to comply when they tried to restrain her with her own shoelaces. Later, she was searched. She describes the way this was done as sexual assault. \"I found it deeply offensive… she touched all my sensitive areas.\"She says her mother paid about 40,000 yuan ($5,700; £4,300) for six months at the institution, and she was not given any academic lessons. Few disciplinary schools offer these, and some that do charge extra for them.The school is still operating, now known as Quality Education for Teenagers, with around 300 students, aged eight to 18.Undercover footage was filmed there earlier this year by a woman posing as a parent considering enrolling her fictional 15-year-old son. She said he was smoking, dating and driving her car.She was shown locked gates on staircases, metal grilles along open-air corridors and CCTV monitoring dormitories where children rest, get changed and shower.Filmed undercover, a staff member says Quality Education for Teenagers uses a \"white lie\" when it takes students to the schoolA staff member told her it would take at least six months to improve the teenager's behaviour, but under a \"three-year warranty\" she could send him back paying for just food and accommodation if he reverted to his old ways.She was told not to tell him about the new school. \"When we arrange pick-ups, we tell a white lie,\" the staff member said.She explained instructors impersonating officials from the \"internet regulator\" would say they needed him to help with an investigation, and take him to the centre. \"If this fails, several instructors will simply restrain him and carry him to the vehicle,\" she said.Another former student, Zhang Enxu, now aged 20, says she had a similar experience when she was taken to a different school in the network.Then 19, she had left home, frustrated with her parents' refusal to accept her transgender identity and her decision to live as a woman - she was registered male at birth. She says she had returned for a family visit to her grandmother's grave, when three men claiming to be police appeared, saying her details had been used in fraud.\"They forcibly dragged me into the car. My parents stood by as I was taken away,\" she says.Enxu says she was beaten and raped at the disciplinary school she was taken to at the age of 19She was taken to Shengbo Youth Psychological Growth Training School in Hunan where she says she was beaten, leaving her with hearing loss in one ear, and later raped.In the undercover footage from the school Baobao attended, a staff member says there are no beatings: \"We change the behaviour of youngsters with military training and counselling.\"But Baobao and Enxu describe a very different experience.\"Corporal punishment is ever-present,\" says Baobao. \"If your dance routines or military boxing lack precision, or are poorly executed, you will be punished.\"She said the instructors would use a pipe, raising it overhead before \"bringing it down with force\" on her classmates. \"Where they hit you would turn black. You get severe bruising.\"Videos obtained and verified by the BBC, that were filmed at another of Li Zheng's schools, show instructors raising a rod high and striking students' hands.Enxu says the students were forced to do \"enormous\" amounts of physical training. She said instructions to carry out exercises like push-ups \"might start at a thousand repetitions\".She also says she was attacked in her dormitory by an instructor on night duty: \"He grabbed me by the hair and dragged me to the floor, then he sexually assaulted me.\"Enxu's parents were sent videos of her at the school taking part in drills and counselling sessionsBaobao says she considered trying to kill herself, but realised she would be caught in the hours it would take her to die.She says one of her classmates did attempt to take her own life, but instead of taking her to hospital, the instructors tried to flush her stomach themselves.Both Baobao and Enxu describe counselling sessions where little understanding was shown.Enxu's sessions were videoed for her parents, who she says had paid 65,800 yuan ($9,300, £7,000) for six months. \"Be a happy, healthy, positive boy. All right?\" she is urged. \"You're a boy, do what boys do… just be happy.\"Baobao says that when she told the counsellor she wanted to end her life, the response was: \"If you were going to die, you wouldn't be sitting here in front of me.\"\"Is that something a caring person would say? Are they even human?\" she asks.Both students wondered how their parents could have decided to subject them to the experience.Enxu's mother wept as she told the BBC the family had been \"deceived\" by the school's promises: \"Not only did you swindle someone out of their money, but you also tore their family apart, causing a breakdown in their relationship.\"Footage obtained by the BBC that was filmed at one of Li Zheng's schools shows an instructor hitting a student on the handSocial pressure to have academically successful children plays a major role in parents' decisions - particularly among urban middle-class families - to send their children to disciplinary schools, says Dr Yichen Rao, an anthropologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.He has studied internet addiction centres for young people in China, and says lack of support in the school system, anxiety, and conflict within the family can combine to make parents \"feel that they have no other choices\".Baobao's mother declined to comment. Her daughter says she can now \"understand both sides\": \"I think she was brainwashed by the slogans used to sell the school. She was desperate for me to become more obedient… to be the daughter she always wanted.\"Baobao managed to leave after feigning an eye problem. Her mother simply said \"let's turn the page\", leaving her angry and confused, she recalls.Viral lettersEnxu's ordeal ended after a month. Her friends realised she was missing and contacted the police, who then located her and shared a video of her at the school. Her friend Wang Yuhang identified the school by asking in online groups about the green uniform she was wearing.Enxu discreetly documented her experience in letters that were smuggled out and posted online. They went viral and as public pressure grew, the police intervened and she was allowed to leave.Twelve days later, authorities announced Shengbo school was closing, but made no reference to the abuse Enxu alleged, saying, however, that the school had violated administrative regulations.She says the police later told her Li Zheng had been arrested, accused of involvement in organised crime. The police did not respond to BBC requests for information about Enxu's case and Mr Li. The local education department have also not responded.Secret filmingUndercover footage shows students doing military-style drills at a new school set up by former employees of Li Zheng schoolsMr Li keeps a relatively low public profile. The BBC has analysed his network and found it operates disciplinary schools across four provinces through a complex set of companies registered to him or his close associates.He founded his first centre in 2006 and has owned four different education companies at different times.The website of one of his organisations says he is a graduate of a Chinese Air Force academy in southern China, and worked as a \"director of training\" and \"senior psychological counsellor\" at several schools from 2007.On local television in Hunan province, he once spoke about nurturing young people with \"love and patience\".Chinese authorities have intervened before, following allegations about schools in the network.An instructor at a different Li Zheng school was detained by police in 2019 after allegations he had beaten students with water pipes.Also, according to Chinese media reports, the school Baobao attended was ordered to stop admissions after a student suicide in 2020. She was there at the time and says it continued to operate over that period. It changed its name soon afterwards.Mu Zhou, an Australia-based volunteer who has been helping document allegations of abuse, says \"whenever there's public outcry, he [Li Zheng] would alter the name or change the legal representative\". He also says students are bussed between different sites to avoid inspections.'Huge profits'Two undercover researchers recently visited what may be the latest addition to the Li Zheng network.Posing as investors in the Hong Kong education sector, the researchers set up a meeting with three former employees of Li Zheng schools, in a new school they have set up in Fujian.\"The profits in this industry are huge,\" Li Yunfeng, the director of counselling at the new school, told them. He outlined how the business model could work in Hong Kong, suggesting fees of at least $25,000 (£19,000) per student annually.He declined to disclose the name of their boss, but said he was \"a veteran\".He appeared to distance himself from the network, however, telling the undercover researchers: \"There were some incidents. The parents lodged a complaint. The group... though not formally dissolved yet, it's teetering on the brink of collapse. That's why I stepped out.\"Secret filmingLi Yunfeng told undercover researchers the previous group was \"on the brink of collapse\" but he is helping open a new schoolThe BBC was not able to reach Li Zheng, Li Yunfeng and other schools and companies linked to Li Zheng and his associates for comment, despite multiple attempts.The staff member who provided a tour of the Quality Education for Teenagers school declined to comment. The education department which oversees the school could not be reached, despite multiple attempts.Regulating these disciplinary centres is difficult. Some are not registered as schools. The responsibility is split between local education, civil affairs and market regulation authorities, a Chinese lawyer familiar with lawsuits against such institutions, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC.Dr Rao says that with no centralised regulation over the disciplinary schools, the responsibility tends to fall to local government.He describes it as a \"shadowy industry that the state just tolerates\", adding that the state may not wish to give it legitimacy by providing regulation or guidelines.But, he adds, there is a \"spectrum\" of schools, with some incorporating psychotherapy for students and training for parents, or disciplining staff who carry out corporal punishment.The Chinese embassy in London said the government \"attaches great importance to the lawful operation of educational institutions and the protection of minors\". It says all educational institutions \"are required to comply with relevant laws and regulations\".'Terribly sad'Enxu and her friend Wang want to see all disciplinary schools shut down. They work to gather video evidence of abuse and abduction, believing this is crucial to get the police to investigate, sometimes posting it online.Wang often receives requests from students. He has helped with the logistics of escape attempts and by pressuring schools to allow students to leave.Baobao never returned to education, which she says makes her feel \"terribly sad\". She now makes a living through online streaming and gaming, but believes she might have gone to university if she had not been sent to the Lizheng Quality Education School.\"These schools are essentially scams,\" she says.\"The prevailing educational ethos is one of violence begetting violence… the very concept is fundamentally flawed,\" she says, adding that they \"simply shouldn't exist\".Details of organisations offering information and support with mental health, distress or despair, or sexual abuse or violence, are available at BBC ActionLine.Additional reporting by Alex Mattholie and Shanshan Chen",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has said the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia will halt fighting \"effective this evening\".Trump made the announcement after telephone conversations with the two leaders following deadly border clashes in recent days which have left at least 20 people dead and half a million displaced.Neither Thai PM Anutin Charnvirakul nor his Cambodian counterpart Hun Manet has commented.However, after his call with Trump earlier, Charnvirakul told a news conference that a ceasefire would only come about if \"Cambodia will cease fire, withdraw its troops, remove all landmines it has planted\".In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump said both leaders \"have agreed to CEASE all shooting effective this evening, and go back to the original Peace Accord made with me.\"Both Countries are ready for PEACE and continued Trade with the United States of America.\"The long-standing border dispute escalated on 24 July, as Cambodia launched a barrage of rockets into Thailand, which responded with air strikes.After days of intense fighting which left dozens dead, the neighbouring South East Asian countries agreed to an \"immediate and unconditional ceasefire\" brokered by Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.Since then, tensions continued to build.This week, violence expanded into at least six provinces in north-eastern Thailand and five provinces in Cambodia's north and north-west.The two countries have been been contesting territorial sovereignty along their 800km land border for more than a century, since the borders of the two nations were drawn after the French occupation of Cambodia.",

    "body": "7 hours agoAndré Rhoden-PaulAFP via Getty ImagesIranian security forces have \"violently arrested\" Nobel Peace Prize winner and women's rights activist Narges Mohammadi, her foundation has said. The Narges Foundation said Ms Mohammadi, 53, was detained in the eastern city of Mashhad, along with other activists. The Nobel Committee said it was \"deeply concerned by today's brutal arrest of Narges Mohammadi\" and called on the authorities \"to immediately clarify Mohammadi's whereabouts, ensure her safety and integrity, and to release her without conditions\". Iran does not appear to have commented.  Ms Mohammadi was awarded the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize for her activism against female oppression in Iran and promoting human rights. In December 2024, she was given a temporary release from jail for three weeks on medical grounds, after being held in Tehran's notorious Evin prison since 2021. She was expected to return to prison soon after, where she was serving multiple sentences. Her latest arrest reportedly came as she attended a memorial ceremony for Khosrow Alikordi, a lawyer found dead in his office last week. Norway-based group Iran Human Rights had called for an independent inquiry to establish how he died, saying the circumstances around his death were \"suspicious\". Several other activists were detained at the ceremony, where it's reported they shouted slogans, including \"death to the dictator\" and \"long live Iran\". Taghi Rahmani, Ms Mohammadi's husband, told BBC Persian: \"They arrested Narges violently. The brother of the lawyer witnessed her arrest at the memorial.\"This act is against human rights laws, and amounts to some kind of revenge. \"This happened in Mashhad today and is concerning because the establishment's crackdown has intensified recently.\"Ms Mohammadi had recently accused the Iranian authorities of intensifying repression since the June ceasefire with Israel. Last week she wrote an article for Time magazine about the Iranian state controlling all aspects of personal or public life. \"Their peace is disrupted by surveillance, censorship, arbitrary arrest, torture, and the constant threat of violence,\" she said. She had also told the Nobel Committee she had received warnings from \"agents of the regime\" through indirect channels and her lawyers. \"The threats conveyed to Ms Mohammadi make it clear that her security is at stake, unless she commits to end all public engagement within Iran, as well as any international advocacy or media appearances in support of democracy, human rights, and freedom of expression,\" the Nobel committee's statement added.Over the past year, she has continued to remain defiant, refusing to wear the mandatory headscarf and meeting fellow activists across the country.Across her lifetime, Mohammadi has been arrested 13 times and been sentenced to more 36 years imprisonment and 154 lashes, according to her foundation.

    "body": "George WrightandBethany Bell,BerlinGermany has accused Russia of a cyber-attack on air traffic control and attempted electoral interference, and summoned the Russian ambassador. A foreign ministry spokesman said Russian military intelligence was behind a \"cyber-attack against German air traffic control in August 2024\". The spokesman also accused Russia of seeking to influence and destabilise the country's federal election in February this year. The latest accusations come amid heightened concern in Europe over suspected Russian cyber-attacks since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Russia has \"categorically rejected\" the claims, saying their alleged involvement in such incidents was \"absurd\".\"The accusations of Russian state structures' involvement in these incidents and in the activities of hacker groups in general are baseless, unfounded and absurd,\" Russia's embassy in Berlin said in a statement to AFP news agency.The foreign ministry in Germany said that Berlin - in close co-ordination with its European partners - would respond with counter-measures to make Russia \"pay a price for its hybrid actions\".In the last year, both the UK and Romania have accused Russia of meddling in their domestic affairs, including targeting organisations that deliver foreign assistance to Ukraine and presidential elections.The spokesman said the August 2024 cyber-attack on Germany could be attributed to the Fancy Bear Russian hacker group.\"Our intelligence findings prove that the Russian military intelligence service GRU bears responsibility for this attack,\" he added.The ministry spokesman added it was now certain that Moscow had attempted to  \"influence and destabilise both the last federal election and the ongoing internal affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany\" through a disinformation campaign called Storm 1516.The campaign, it said, had focused in part on lead Green Party candidate Robert Habeck and lead CDU candidate Friedrich Merz, who is now chancellor.The German government said security agencies had identified fake videos alleging ballot manipulation as part of a Russian disinformation effort just days before the election.Its air navigation service provider confirmed that its office communication had been hacked in August 2024. It said flights had not been affected.Fancy Bear is said to have previously leaked World Anti-Doping Agency data, and played a key role in the 2016 cyber-attack on the US Democratic National Committee, according to security experts.Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has led to a major deterioration in relations between Berlin and Moscow.Germany has emerged as one of Ukraine's most vocal supporters, providing military, financial and diplomatic support for Kyiv.Chancellor Friedrich Merz has called strongly for frozen Russian assets to be used to help protect Ukraine.He has also repeatedly accused Russia of cyber warfare against his country.But relations have been strained for years, even before the Russian invasion. In 2019, an ethnic Chechen was killed by a Russian national, Vadim Krasikov, in broad daylight in Berlin's Tiergarten Park. Germany later expelled two Russian diplomats, as prosecutors suspected that he was acting on the orders of Russia's state security agency.While it is yet to respond to the latest allegations, Moscow has previously denied  European allegations of a Russian sabotage or hybrid campaign.",

    "body": "A large fire broke out on a Turkish car ferry anchored at the Ukrainian port city of Odesa after it was hit in a strike on Friday.The company that operates the Cenk T confirmed the attack occurred at 16:00 local time (14:00 GMT) shortly after it docked at the Chornomorsk port.Ukraine's President Volodymr Zelensky has blamed the strike on Russia, which has not commented.The attack came hours after Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told Russian President Vladimir Putin that a limited ceasefire for energy facilities and ports could be beneficial. Russia has resisted all calls for a ceasefire.Moscow has threatened to cut \"Ukraine off from the sea\" in response to Kyiv's maritime drone attacks on Russia's \"shadow fleet\" tankers thought to be used to export oil - and a main source for funding the ongoing war.Cenk Denizcilik, the company that owns the cargo ship that operates on the Karasu-Odesa route across the Black Sea, said on Friday that it had been carrying \"essential food supplies\" when it was hit shortly after anchoring at the Ukrainian port city.Emergency response measures were immediately activated with the vessel's crew, port fire brigade and assisting tugboats after a fire broke out on the forward section of the ship, the company's statement added.\"At this stage, there are no reports of casualties or injuries among the crew,\" it said.Video footage of the attack's aftermath, which was shared on Zelensky's Telegram account, shows crews attempting to extinguish a large blaze on the vessel.  While condemning a series of missile attacks that Russia had carried out on the Odesa region the night before, the Ukrainian leader blamed Moscow for targeting the civilian Turkish ship, saying it \"could not have any military meaning\".Turkey's foreign ministry said an agreement should be reached that would guarantee \"the security of shipping and suspending attacks against energy and port infrastructure in order to prevent escalation in the Black Sea\". \"We once again underline the importance of urgently ending the war between Russia and Ukraine,\" the ministry said.Turkey has sought to maintain relations with the two warring countries since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. It also controls the Bosphorus Strait, which is a key passage for transporting Ukrainian grain and Russian oil out to the Mediterranean. Russia carried out a second round of strikes on Odesa later in the evening which damaged the port infrastructure facility, according to the region's head of administration.\"[This] emphasises the deliberate nature of enemy strikes on the civilian infrastructure of the region,\" Oleg Kiper wrote in a Telegram post.Friday's strikes knocked out electricity for thousands of homes in Odesa.This comes as US President Donald Trump appears to have grown frustrated by the slow progress his administration is making in securing a deal to end the war between Ukraine and Russia.Despite Washington's recent diplomatic push, Kyiv and Moscow have rejected key parts of the Trump administration's proposal.While Ukraine is adamant that there should be security guarantees from the US and Europe in place before agreeing to an end to the war, Russia is continuing to demand territorial concessions - which Kyiv has resisted.Russia has been making slow gains on the ground recently.But claims it is in control of key hubs, such as the key town of Pokrovsk - a strategic point on a big road and rail artery in the eastern  Donetsk region - are being denied by the Ukrainians.And in a show of defiance on Friday, President Zelensky posted a video of himself in  Kupyansk - which Moscow claimed to have captured last month.

    "body": "6 hours agoHugh SchofieldParis correspondent Angry French farmers are calling for more protests over the government-backed slaughter of cattle herds affected by so-called Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD).On Thursday there were clashes between riot police and demonstrators in the southern Ariège department, after vets were called in to destroy potentially contaminated cattle at a farm.Elsewhere in the south, farmers have dumped manure outside government buildings and blocked roads. The offices of several environmentalist groups were ransacked in the Charente-Maritime department.LSD is a highly contagious bovine disease which is transmitted mainly by fly-bites.  The symptoms are fever, mucal discharge and nodules on the skin.Though mainly non-fatal, it can badly affect milk-production and the cows are unsaleable. The disease arrived in Europe from Africa about ten years ago. France's first outbreak was in the Alps in June, when an infected herd forced the Tour de France cycle race to cut short one of its stages.The government's policy of slaughtering entire herds where a single animal has been infected has run up against bitter opposition from two of the three main farmers' unions.Conféderation Rurale and Conféderation Paysanne say the policy is being brutally applied, and is in any case unnecessary because a combination of selective culling and vaccination would suffice.But most vets disagree. \"Right now we are unable to tell the difference between a healthy animal and a symptomless animal carrying the virus. That is the only reason we have to carry out these whole-herd slaughters,\" said Stephanie Philizot who heads the SNGTV vets' union.Since June there have been around 110 outbreaks of LSD in France, originally in the east but now increasingly in the south-west. Ministry officials blame the illegal movement of cattle from affected zones. Around 3,000 animals have been slaughtered.The French government is worried the protests could snowball into a wider movement among a farming population that feels itself under growing threat from the imposition of EU norms and competition from abroad.A big protest is planned in Brussels next week during the summit of EU leaders.  Several French farming sectors are in deep crisis, from wine-growers hit by falling consumption to poultry farmers hit by avian flu.There is also widespread opposition to the impending signature of an EU free-trade agreement with South American countries, which farmers fear will open France to more cheap food imports, much of it produced under looser environmental and sanitary constraints.",

    "body": "13 hours agoThomas NaadiBBC Africa, AccraA popular Ghanaian social media influencer known as Abu Trica, whose real name is Frederick Kumi, has been arrested over allegations he orchestrated a romance scam that defrauded elderly Americans of over $8m (£5.9m).Prosecutors said he used AI tools to create fake online identities, targeting victims through social media and dating sites, earning their trust then extorting their money.Kumi faces charges in the US of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and a money laundering conspiracy and faces up to 20 years in prison if found guilty.The 31-year-old was arrested in Ghana following a joint operation between the two countries and the US will now seek to extradite him.He has not yet commented on the allegations.Kumi, who is also known as Emmanuel Kojo Baah Obeng, flaunted luxury items online to his more than 100,000 Instagram followers.This raised suspicions about the sources of his income.''The perpetrators built trust through frequent, intimate conversations by phone, email, and messaging platforms\" with victims, said prosecutors. \"They then requested money or valuables under false pretences, such as urgent medical needs, travel expenses, or investment opportunities.'' The monies, or valuables, were then directed to co-conspirators posing as third parties. Kumi allegedly distributed the money to his associates in US and in Ghana.The case is being prosecuted under the US Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution law.US authorities have in recent months stepped up their crackdown on criminal networks operating in the US and West Africa who seek to defraud elderly Americans.In July this year,  an alleged Ghanaian fraudster, popularly known as Dada Joe Remix, was extradited to the US for using romance and inheritance schemes to defraud Americans.Earlier this month, a court in the US also sentenced Oluwaseun Adekoya, a Nigerian ringleader of nationwide bank fraud and money laundering conspiracies, to 20 years in prison for laundering over $2m.Additional reporting by Natasha Booty",

    "body": "Reddit has launched a challenge in Australia's highest court against the nation's landmark social media ban for children.The online forum is among 10 social media platforms which must bar Australians aged under 16 from having accounts, under a new law which began on Wednesday.The ban, which is being watched closely around the world, was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful content and algorithms.Reddit is complying with the ban, but in its case will argue that the policy has serious implications for privacy and political rights. It is the second such legal challenge, with two Australian teens also awaiting a High Court hearing.\"Despite the best intentions, this law is missing the mark,\" Reddit said in an update on its website.\"There are more effective ways for the Australian government to accomplish our shared goal of protecting youth.\"Australia's Communications Minister Anika Wells has previously said the government will not be swayed by legal threats.\"We will not be intimidated by big tech. On behalf of Australian parents, we will stand firm,\" she told parliament after news of the first legal challenge broke last month.In that case, which the High Court has agreed to consider at an as-yet undecided date next year, two 15-year-olds from New South Wales are claiming the social media ban is unconstitutional as it infringes \"the implied freedom of communication on governmental and political matters\".\"Democracy doesn't start at 16 as this law says it will,\" Macey Newland told the BBC after their case was filed.The ban, which has excited global leaders and worried tech companies, has also been criticised by some who argue blanket prohibition is neither practical nor wise.Experts fear kids are going to circumvent the ban with relative ease - either by tricking the technology that's performing the age checks, or by finding other, potentially less safe, places on the net to gather.And backed by some mental health advocates, many children have argued it robs young people of connection - particularly those from LGBTQ+, neurodivergent or rural communities - and will leave them less equipped to tackle the realities of life on the web.But the policy is wildly popular with parents and has won the support of people like talk show host Oprah Winfrey, and Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.In a statement on their website, the pair lauded the \"bold\" action from Australia but said \"it shouldn't have come to this\".\"We hope this ban is only the start of a reckoning between society and the tech companies that built these platforms with growth as their first principle instead of safety.\"Various governments, from the US state of Florida to the European Union, have been experimenting with limiting children's use of social media. But, along with a higher age limit of 16, Australia is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest.Reddit said the law forces \"intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors\", isolates teens engaging in \"age-appropriate community experiences\" and creates an \"illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren't\".\"There are more targeted, privacy-preserving measures to protect young people online without resorting to blanket bans.\"The case is not \"an attempt to avoid compliance\" or \"an effort to retain young users for business reasons\", it added.\"Unlike other platforms included under this law, the vast majority of Redditors are adults, we don't market or target advertising to children under 18,\" it said.The other platforms affected by the ban include Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and  TikTok.",

    "body": "11 hours agoMatt MurphyBBC Verify    BBCA Sudanese paramilitary commander, whose role in the el-Fasher massacre was revealed by BBC Verify, has been sanctioned by the UK government.Brig Gen Al-Fateh Abdullah Idris, also known as Abu Lulu, was filmed shooting dead at least 10 unarmed captives after the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) seized the city in late October.Thousands of people are believed to have been killed by the RSF after the army withdrew from el-Fasher. UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said the atrocities taking place in Sudan were \"a scar on the conscience of the world\" which \"cannot, and will not, go unpunished.\"The UK has also sanctioned three other RSF commanders, including deputy head Abdul Rahim Hamdan Dagalo.Dagalo, who was also placed under EU sanctions in November, was shown in verified footage touring an army base in the city in the hours after el-Fasher fell. He is the brother of RSF chief Mohamed \"Hemedti\" Dagalo.Sudan's civil war - sparked after the RSF and the military's fragile ruling coalition collapsed - has now raged for more than two years, killing hundreds of thousands of people and displacing millions more.El-Fasher was the army's last major foothold in Darfur, the traditional stronghold of the RSF paramilitary.An investigation by BBC Verify revealed the brutal tactics used by the RSF during the protracted siege, which included detaining and torturing people trying to smuggle supplies into the city and building a massive sand barrier around it to prevent civilians and army troops from escaping.In its statement announcing the sanctions, the UK foreign office said it believed that Abu Lulu was \"responsible for violence against individuals based on ethnicity and religion, and the deliberate targeting of civilians\".Footage confirmed by BBC Verify in October showed Abu Lulu executing several unarmed captives with an AK-style rifle in a sandy, dusty area north-west of the city. RSF troops who witnessed the incidents were later seen celebrating their commander's actions.UK officials accused Abu Lulu, Dagalo, Gedo Hamdan Ahmed and Tijani Ibrahim Moussa Mohamed of carrying out \"heinous\" acts of violence, including mass killings, systematic sexual violence and deliberate attacks on civilians. The men have been placed under travel bans and any assets they hold will be frozen.\"Today's sanctions against RSF commanders strike directly at those with blood on their hands, while our strengthened aid package will deliver lifesaving support to those suffering,\" Cooper said.Citing satellite images - previously published by Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab - the foreign office said piles of bodies and mass graves could be seen in el-Fasher after the massacre.Cooper also pledged an additional £21m to provide food, shelter and health services for civilians impacted by fighting in remote areas.In the days that followed the el-Fasher massacre, RSF leader Gen Mohamed \"Hemedti\" Dagalo admitted that his troops had committed \"violations\" and said the incidents would be investigated.Among those arrested was Abu Lulu. In a carefully choreographed and edited video posted on the RSF's official Telegram account he is shown being led into a cell at a prison, which was geolocated by BBC Verify to the outskirts of el-Fasher.The commander, who previously featured heavily in propaganda videos posted online, has not been seen since his arrest. A TikTok account that documented his activities was removed by the company in October after BBC Verify approached the tech giant for comment.The UK's move comes just two days after the US announced its own set of sanctions against a network of companies and individuals it accused of recruiting former Colombian soldiers and training individuals to fight in Sudan's civil war.The US Treasury Department said that hundreds of Colombian mercenaries have travelled to Sudan since 2024, including to serve as infantry and drone pilots for the RSF.Last month, US President Donald Trump pledged to \"start working on Sudan\" alongside Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, posting on social media that \"tremendous atrocities\" were taking place.",

    "body": "Russia could attack Nato within five years, says alliance chief in stark new warning1 day agoFrank Gardner,Security CorrespondentandPaulin KolaRussia could attack a Nato country within the next five years, the Western military alliance's chief has said in a stark new warning. \"Russia is already escalating its covert campaign against our societies,\"  Mark Rutte said in a speech in Germany. \"We must be prepared for the scale of war our grandparents or great-grandparents endured.\"He echoed similar statements about Russia's intentions made by Western intelligence agencies, which Moscow dismisses as hysteria.Rutte's warning comes as US President Donald Trump tries to bring an end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, launched in February 2022. Earlier this month, Russia's President Vladimir Putin said his country was not planning to go to war with Europe, but it was ready \"right now\" if Europe wanted to - or started a war. But similar reassurances were given by Moscow in 2022, just before 200,000 Russian troops crossed the border and invaded Ukraine.Putin has accused European countries of hindering US efforts to bring peace in Ukraine - a reference to the role Ukraine's European allies have recently played in trying to change a US peace plan to end the war, whose initial draft was seen as favouring Russia.But Putin was not sincere, Nato's secretary-general said in the German capital, Berlin.Supporting Ukraine, he added, was a guarantee for European security.\"Just imagine if Putin got his way; Ukraine under the boot of Russian occupation, his forces pressing against a longer border with Nato, and the significantly increased risk of an armed attack against us.\"Russia's economy has been on a war footing for more than three years now - its factories churn out ever more supplies of drones, missiles and artillery shells.According to a recent report by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, Russia has been producing each month around 150 tanks, 550 infantry fighting vehicles, 120 Lancet drones and more than 50 artillery pieces.The UK, and most of its Western allies, are simply not anywhere near this point.Analysts say it would take years for Western Europe's factories to come close to matching Russia's mass-production of weapons.France and Germany have both recently moved to revive a system of voluntary military service for 18-year-olds.So-called \"hybrid\" or \"grey-zone\" warfare, which includes events that are often deniable, such as cyber-attacks, disinformation and the alleged launching of drones close to airports and military bases in Nato countries, has been ramping up this year.But worrying as these events are, they pale compared to the crisis that would be triggered by a Russian military attack on a Nato country, especially if it involved seizing territory and people being killed.Nato includes 30 European countries - as well as Canada and the US, the alliance's most powerful military member.Under pressure from Trump, its members have pledged to increase military spending.\"Nato's own defences can hold for now,\" Rutte warned in Berlin, but conflict was \"next door\" to Europe and he feared \"too many are quietly complacent, and too many don't feel the urgency, too many believe that time is on our side. \"Allied defence spending and production must rise rapidly, our armed forces must have what they need to keep us safe,\" the Nato chief said.",

I really hope they have things in place for the next year,\" Nemo said at the time. It prompted a series of new measures to be introduced to protect the mental well-being of Eurovision's artists and staff.In a statement posted to Instagram on Thursday, Nemo said they felt the European Broadcasting Union's (EBU) decision to allow Israel to still take part in the event no longer aligned with its core values.\"Israel's continued participation, during what the UN's Independent International Commission of Inquiry has concluded to be a genocide, shows a clear conflict between those ideals and the decision made by the EBU,\" they said, referring to a report released in September.\"Even though I am immensely grateful for the community around this contest and everything this experience has taught me both as a person and artist, today I no longer feel this trophy belongs on my shelf.\"Nemo also posted a video of them placing the trophy in a cardboard box, saying it will be sent back to the EBU's headquarters in Geneva.In a statement sent to BBC News, Martin Green said: \"We're saddened that Nemo wishes to return their trophy which they deservedly won in 2024. \"We respect the deeply held views Nemo has expressed and they will always remain a valued part of the Eurovision family\"EPANemo performing at the 2024 Eurovision in Malmo, SwedenThe boycotts and protests over Israel's inclusion have been the biggest crisis Eurovision has ever seen.This year's competition also had a voting controversy and allegations that Israel's government tried to influence the public vote.This prompted some competition rules to be changed and tightened, after which a \"large majority\" of members agreed there was no need for a further vote on participation and that Eurovision 2026 could proceed as planned, the EBU has said.Israel's President Isaac Herzog has praised the decision to allow the country to compete, calling it an \"appreciated gesture of solidarity, brotherhood, and co-operation\".Addressing the boycotts, Nemo insisted that their decision to hand back the trophy was not about \"individuals or artists\", but rather what they believed was the use of Eurovision to \"soften the image of a state accused of severe wrongdoing\".\"When entire countries withdraw, it should be clear that something is deeply wrong,\" they added.\"If the values we celebrate on stage aren't lived off stage then even the most beautiful songs become meaningless.\"The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 70,370 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Next year's Eurovision is due to take place in Vienna, for what is supposed to be a celebratory 70th anniversary edition of the contest.",

    "body": "7 hours agoTesfalem Araia,BBC TigrinyaandHanna Temuari,BBC Africa, Addis AbabaEritrea has withdrawn from East African regional bloc Igad, accusing the organisation of \"becoming a tool against\" countries like itself.In a statement on Friday, Eritrea's foreign ministry said Igad had strayed from its founding principles and failed to contribute to regional stability.The withdrawal comes amid a fierce war of words between Eritrea and neighbouring Ethiopia, leading to fears of renewed armed conflict.In response to Eritrea's statement, Igad (Intergovernmental Authority on Development) said the country had not made any \"tangible proposals\" or engaged with reforms.Igad was established to promote regional stability and food security in East Africa, and also includes Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, South Sudan, Uganda, and Djibouti.The government in Eritrea's capital, Asmara, has long accused Igad of siding with Ethiopia in regional disputes.Eritrea previously left the bloc in 2007, during its border dispute with Ethiopia. It only rejoined in 2023.\"Eritrea finds itself compelled to withdraw its membership from an organisation that has forfeited its legal mandate and authority; offering no discernible strategic benefit to all its constituencies,\" Eritrea's foreign ministry said on Friday.In its response, Igad said that since the country returned to the bloc it had not \"participated in IGAD meetings, programmes, or activities\".The withdrawal comes as tensions have been increasing between Eritrea and Ethiopia, two countries that have a long history of deadly conflict.Since 2023, Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has been demanding access to the Red Sea through Eritrea, resulting in a furious response from Asmara.After a decades-long battle for independence, Eritrea officially seceded from Ethiopia in 1993, leaving the latter landlocked.In calling for sea access, Abiy and other senior Ethiopian officials have gone as far as questioning Addis Abba's recognition of Eritrean independence.Abiy won a Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for making peace with Eritrea's strongman President Isaias Afewerki, after a two-decade long border dispute that sparked a war in which more than 100,000 people died.During this conflict, Eritrea was accused of destabilising the region by interfering in the internal affairs of Igad member countries, an allegation Asmara always denied.Instead, Eritrea accused its neighbours of siding with Western powers to destabilise it.At the instigation of Addis Ababa, Igad demanded the African Union and UN Security Council impose sanctions on Eritrea.Eritrea cut diplomatic ties with Djibouti, which hosts the Igad headquarters, following a 2009 border dispute between the two countries.Former Ethiopian Foreign Minister Workneh Gebyehu is currently the head of Igad, adding to Asmara's suspicion of the organisation.Igad has been criticised by many for failing to bring stability and regional integration to the Horn of Africa, a region beset by civil wars, terrorism and intra-state confrontations.",

    "body": "Chief of S Korea's high-stakes exam quits over 'insane' English test1 day agoKelly NgReutersSouth Korea's Suneung is an infamous eight-hour marathon of back-to-back examsThe English section of South Korea's gruelling college entrance exam, or Suneung, is notoriously difficult, with some students comparing it to deciphering an ancient script, and others calling it \"insane\".So intense was the criticism around this year's test that the top official in charge of administering it resigned to take responsibility for the \"chaos\" it caused.\"We sincerely accept the criticism that the difficulty of questions... was inappropriate,\" said Suneung chief Oh Seung-geol, adding that the test \"fell short\" despite having gone through several rounds of editing.Among the most daunting questions are one on Immanuel Kant's philosophy of law and another involving gaming jargon.The latter, worth three points, asks students to pick where a sentence should fit in a given paragraph. Here's the sentence in bold, followed by the paragraph:The difference is that the action in the game world can only be explored through the virtual bodily space of the avatar.A video game has its own model of reality, internal to itself and separate from the player's external reality, the player's bodily space and the avatar's bodily space. (1) The avatar's bodily space, the potential actions of the avatar in the game world, is the only way in which the reality of the external reality of the game world can be perceived. (2) As in the real world, perception requires action. (3) Players extend their perceptual field into the game, encompassing the available actions of the avatar. (4) The feedback loop of perception and action that enables you to navigate the world around you is now one step removed: instead of perceiving primarily through interaction of your own body with the external world, you're perceiving the game world through interaction of the avatar. (5) The entire perceptual system has been extended into the game world.The correct answer is 3.Many have criticised the way the question and several others were worded. One user on Reddit called it \"fancy smart talking\" while another said it was \"awful writing [that] doesn't convey a concept or idea well\".Students are given 70 minutes to attempt 45 questions. Just over 3% of this year's test-takers scored the highest grade for the English section, compared to 6% last year.\"It took me a long time to figure out [several questions] and understanding the texts themselves was tricky... [Some] answers looked similar to each other. So I was unsure until the last minute,\" said Im Na-hye, a senior in Hanyeong High School.But English language professor Jung Chae-kwan says it is a misnomer to call the English test tough.\"The texts aren't necessarily impossible, but... maddeningly confusing. It's a pain because it makes the material useless for actual education, \" says Prof Jung, who previously worked at the institution that administers the Suneung, and now teaches at Incheon National University. \"Teachers end up drilling test-taking hacks rather than teaching English... You don't even really need to read the full text to get the points if you know the tricks,\" he said.Some pointed out that several passages used in the questions are excerpts from books that have been taken out of context, making them hard to comprehend. The above passage, for example, comes from Game Feel, a game design guide written by Steve Swink.Others, however, believe the difficulty of the test reflects its intended purpose.\"It measures students' reading comprehension and whether they can handle the level of material they'll encounter in university,\" says Kim Soo-yeon, an English literature professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul.The passages chosen have \"some degree of specialisation\", which allows the test to assess such comprehension skills, she told The Korea Times.ReutersParents light up candles at a Buddhist temple in Seoul as they pray for their children, who are taking the high-stakes Suneung exam on 13 NovemberSouth Korea's Suneung, held every November, is an infamous eight-hour marathon of back-to-back exams that not only dictates whether people will be able to go to university, but can also affect their job prospects, income and future relationships.Students attempt about 200 questions across various subjects, which include Korean, maths, English, social and natural sciences, among others. Many teenagers spend all their lives preparing for these exams - some of them sent to private tuition centres known as \"cram schools\" from as young as four.The Suneung is a monumental event for the rest of South Korea too, as it brings much of the country to a standstill for a single day.Construction work halts, planes are grounded and military training gets suspended to facilitate an optimal testing environment.Only four of the 12 Suneung chiefs since the exam debuted in 1993 have served out their full three-year terms. While most stepped down because of errors in test questions, Mr Oh is the first to resign over a test's difficulty.Additional reporting by Hyojung Kim and Jake Kwon in SeoulIf you want to test yourself, here's another question: Kant was a strong defender of the rule of law as the ultimate guarantee, not only of security and peace, but also of freedom. He believed that human societies were moving towards more rational forms regulated by effective and binding legal frameworks because only such frameworks enabled people to live in harmony, to prosper and to co-operate. However, his belief in inevitable progress was not based on an optimistic or high-minded view of human nature. On the contrary, it comes close to Hobbes's outlook: man's violent and conflict-prone nature makes it necessary to establish and maintain an effective legal framework in order to secure peace. We cannot count on people's benevolence or goodwill, but even 'a nation of devils' can live in harmony in a legal system that binds every citizen equally. Ideally, the law is the embodiment of those political principles that all rational beings would freely choose. If such laws forbid them to do something that they would not rationally choose to do anyway, then the law cannot be:(1) regarded as reasonably confining human liberty (2) viewed as a strong defender of the justice system (3) understood as a restraint on their freedom (4) enforced effectively to suppress their evil nature (5) accepted within the assumption of ideal legal frameworks If you've made it this far, the correct number is 3 ",

    "body": "As Trump targets Venezuela, its allies Russia and China show little signs of support27 minutes agoNorberto ParedesBBC News MundoGetty ImagesVenezuelan President Nicolás Maduro could be forgiven for wondering who his true friends are. Once rock solid, his reliance on his two main allies - China and Russia - now appears increasingly uncertain.For years, both countries supported Venezuela's socialist-led government politically, financially and militarily - a relationship that began under former President Hugo Chávez, Maduro's mentor and predecessor.But experts say that backing now seems to be largely symbolic, with statements being given in support rather than concrete military or financial aid.This shift comes as the US has deployed air and naval forces - including a nuclear-powered submarine, spy planes and 15,000 troops - to the Caribbean.The US has conducted strikes on boats in the region that it alleges are smuggling drugs, killing more than 80 people, and in recent days, it seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela.The Trump administration has said the military build-up and strikes are targeting drug trafficking, and the tanker had been sanctioned. But many experts - and Maduro himself - believe Washington's real goal is regime change.So at the Venezuelan president's hour of greatest need, what has changed?Prof Fernando Reyes Matta, director of the Centre for China Studies at Andrés Bello University in Chile, argues that Venezuela has become a far lower priority for both Beijing and Moscow, especially since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House.\"There is no reason today for either Russia or China to go all-in defending Venezuela given their other problems, such as Russia and its war in Ukraine, and China trying to coexist internationally with President Trump,\" he says.Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has poured enormous resources into the conflict, straining both its finances and its military. It has also faced sweeping Western sanctions.This leaves fewer resources for allies that previously benefited from Kremlin support, says Prof Vladimir Rouvinski, the director of the Laboratory of Politics and International Relations (PoInt) at Icesi University in Colombia.Syria and Iran, Moscow's long-standing allies in the Middle East, have faced a similar fate in recent times.\"Russia will [not] risk receiving more sanctions than it already has, [and] China will not risk getting more tariffs imposed on it for defending Maduro,\" Prof Rouvinski explains.Maduro reportedly asked China and Russia for military assistance at the end of October, according to The Washington Post.The Kremlin's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov has said \"we support Venezuela, as it supports us\", while urging the Trump administration to avoid escalating the crisis, Russian media reported. And in the wake of the American seizure of the oil tanker, the Kremlin said Putin had called Maduro to affirm his support.But so far, Moscow has not provided any material assistance.Getty ImagesPutin and Maduro met in Moscow in May 2025. Russia has provided Venezuela with military support for yearsLike Moscow, Beijing has shown no sign it would militarily defend Venezuela, instead condemning what it calls \"external interference\" and urging restraint.Experts say China defending Maduro could jeopardise recent diplomatic gains between Beijing and Washington, while offering little beyond ideological alignment.US–China relations have been particularly tense since Trump imposed tariffs on multiple countries. But a meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea in late October - described as positive by both sides - opened the door to new agreements and lower tariffs on certain products.According to experts, Venezuela's economic collapse and the deterioration of its oil industry have further discouraged Chinese support. Beijing has reduced new lending in recent years and is now focused mainly on recovering past loans.\"I think China is willing to negotiate with any government that eventually replaces Maduro, and believes that supporting Maduro too strongly now could bring negative consequences when the regime falls,\" says Prof Rouvinski.Getty ImagesVenezuela has purchased hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of Chinese military equipment since 2005Prof Reyes Matta does not think \"either of the two countries is willing to support a regime that has so little internal backing\".\"Moreover, both Russia and China know that the last presidential election had very evident fraudulent characteristics.\"The July 2024 election was marred by serious allegations of fraud. The National Electoral Council (CNE), dominated by government allies, proclaimed Maduro the winner but provided no detailed results, unlike in previous elections.The opposition - led by this year's Nobel Peace Prize laureate María Corina Machado - released electoral records suggesting the opposition candidate Edmundo González won.\"This time, Maduro is completely alone,\" says Prof Rouvinski, who believes Maduro's time is \"running out\". \"Russia and China may continue criticising US intervention, but they are not willing to go any further. The support he had in the past is no longer there in real terms, beyond certain rhetorical statements.\"Additional reporting by BBC Global Journalism ",

    "body": "A diamond-studded locket swallowed by a New Zealand man who tried to steal it has been \"recovered\", police say.The Fabergé egg locket, valued at NZ$33,585 ($19,300; £14,600), was recovered in a \"natural\" manner. \"Medical intervention [was] not required,\" they told the BBC.This comes about a week after police arrested the 32-year-old man at Partridge Jewellers in central Auckland, minutes after he allegedly ate the locket.The ingested loot is set with 60 white diamonds and 15 blue sapphires, according to the jeweller's website, and opens to reveal an 18-carat gold miniature octopus.The man has been charged with theft.Earlier this week, New Zealand police said the man had undergone a medical assessment and is constantly being monitored.\"Given this man is in police custody, we have a duty of care to continue monitoring him given the circumstances of what has occurred,\" police said then.The Octopussy egg, as it is named, was inspired by the 1983 James Bond film of the same name, which centres on an elaborate Fabergé egg heist.Fabergé is a world-renowned jeweller founded in Russia more than two centuries ago, famous for its eggs made of gems and precious metals.Partridge Jewellers said the locket will be returned to Fabergé, Radio NZ reported.The suspect is due to appear in court again on 8 December.According to charge sheets seen by the BBC, he has also been charged with allegedly stealing an iPad from the same jewellery store on 12 November and making away with cat litter and flea control products worth NZ$100 from a private address a day after.",

    "body": "The man accused of assassinating former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has apologised to the ex-leader's family for the first time.Tetsuya Yamagami, who earlier pleaded guilty to murder, told the court on Thursday that he felt \"deeply sorry\" towards Abe's widow, Akie.Yamagami used a homemade gun to shoot Abe during a political campaign event in the western city of Nara on 8 July 2022. He died in the hospital on the same day.Abe's death sent shockwaves around the world. He was known for his hawkish foreign policy and a signature economic strategy that popularly came to be known as \"Abenomics\".\"I have caused [the family] three and a half years of suffering... I have no excuse,\" Yamagami told the court on Thursday, according to local media.He reportedly told investigators he attacked Abe because he blamed the ex-prime minister for allegedly promoting the Unification Church, which Yamagami said had bankrupted his mother and the wider family.Yamagami's allegations prompted investigations into the Unification Church, which started in South Korea and is known for its mass weddings.In March this year, a Tokyo court ordered the church to disband - a ruling that the church said it would \"fight to the end\".The Unification Church has drawn controversy even before Abe's assassination, for teaching that marriage is central to spiritual salvation.Abe's grandfather Nobusuke Kishi, who was also Japan's prime minister, was known to have been close to the Unification Church because of its anti-communist nature. Abe himself had spoken at events related to the group.During a hearing last month, prosecutors read out a statement from Abe's widow in which she wrote: \"The sorrow of losing a husband will not be relieved.\"",

    "body": "3 days agoSteve RosenbergBBC Russia editorWhat does the latest round of diplomacy on Ukraine tell us about Russian President Vladimir Putin's mood and intentions?For starters, that he's not ready to sign a peace deal. At least, not right now.And certainly not the deal (or deals) on the table.\"No compromise version has yet been found,\" commented Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov after five hours of talks in Moscow involving Putin, US envoy Steve Witkoff, and Donald Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner.No compromise is no real surprise, considering the Kremlin leader's uncompromising comments in recent days. In various statements he has condemned the Ukrainian leadership as a \"thieving junta\", accused European leaders of trying to sabotage peace efforts, and insisted that Russia holds the initiative on the battlefield.On a couple of recent occasions Russian TV showed Putin in military fatigues, studying maps of the front line and trumpeting military gains, many of which Ukraine and international observers have denied.After nearly four years of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, despite the heavy losses Russia has suffered on the battlefield and the damage to the Russian economy, President Putin seems convinced that he is winning this war and that now is not the moment to stop.At least, that is what he would like the West to believe: that nothing can stop him now from achieving his goals.I've said before that, in many ways, Vladimir Putin reminds me of a car with no brakes, no steering wheel and no reverse gear; a vehicle careering full speed down the motorway.Nearly four years after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine there is still no sign of the \"Putinmobile\" turning off, turning back, or coming to a halt.He certainly wants his opponents to think that nothing or no one can force him to change direction: neither European leaders, nor the Trump administration, nor President Zelensky.But cars need fuel (a constant supply).And, to fight a war, countries need money (a constant supply).For now, despite international sanctions, Russia's government is still able to finance the \"special military operation\" - its war on Ukraine. But economic pressures are building: revenues from oil and gas have been falling, the budget deficit growing.Even Putin admits there are problems, referring to \"imbalances\" in the economy.\"In several sectors, production output not only failed to increase this year but actually decreased,\" Putin said this week. \"Are we satisfied with such trends? No.\"The big unknown: at what point, if at all, will economic concerns start to influence the Kremlin's calculations on the battlefield?",

    "body": "6 hours agoBrandon Drenon,Washington DC andMadeline HalpertThe US Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case on whether some children born in the US have a constitutional right to citizenship.On his first day in office in January, President Donald Trump signed an order to end birthright citizenship for those born to parents who are in the country illegally, but the move was blocked by multiple lower courts.No date has been set yet for the Supreme Court arguments, and a ruling is months away.Whatever the court decides could have major implications for Trump's immigration crackdown and for what it means to be an American citizen.For nearly 160 years, the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution has established the principle that anyone born in the country is a US citizen, with exceptions for children born to diplomats and foreign military forces.The language of the amendment states: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\"Trump's executive order seeks to deny citizenship to the children of people who are either in the US illegally or are in the country on temporary visas. It is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to reform the nation's immigration system and combat what they have called \"significant threats to national security and public safety\".The administration has argued the 14th Amendment clause \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" means the amendment excludes children of people who are not in the country permanently or lawfully.Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs in the case, told the BBC's news partner CBS that no president can change the 14th Amendment's fundamental promise of citizenship.\"For over 150 years, it has been the law and our national tradition that everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth,\"  Ms Wang said in a statement. \"We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term,\" she added.The US is one of about 30 countries - mostly in the Americas - that grant automatic citizenship to anyone born within their borders.After legal challenges were brought to Trump's executive order, several federal  court judges ruled that it violated the Constitution, while two federal circuit courts of appeals upheld injunctions blocking the order from going into effect.Trump then went to the Supreme Court to fight the injunctions. In a win for Trump, the court ruled in June that the injunctions issued by the lower courts exceeded their authority, though it did not address the issue of birthright citizenship itself. The 14th Amendment was passed in the wake of the US Civil War in order to settle the question of the citizenship of freed, American-born former slaves.US Solicitor General D John Sauer has argued that the amendment was adopted \"to confer citizenship on the newly freed slaves and their children, not on the children of aliens temporarily visiting the United States or of illegal aliens\".He has said it's a \"mistaken view\" that birth on US soil confers citizenship and has argued that that understanding has had \"destructive consequences\"About 250,000 babies were born to unauthorised immigrant parents in the US in 2016 - a 36% decrease from a peak in 2007, according to The Pew Research Center.By 2022, the latest year that data is available, there were 1.2 million US citizens born to unauthorised immigrant parents, Pew found.A study published in May by the thinktank Migration Policy Institute and Pennsylvania State University's Population Research Institute suggested that repealing birthright citizenship could increase the size of the unauthorized population in the US by an additional 2.7 million by 2045 and by 5.4 million by 2075.",

    "body": "15 hours agoVikas Pandey,DelhiandRuth ComerfordRussian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow is ready to provide \"uninterrupted shipments\" of fuel to India, as Delhi faces pressure from the US to stop buying Russian oil.Putin, speaking alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi, questioned earlier why India should be punished for buying oil when the US itself buys nuclear fuel from Moscow.President Donald Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on most Indian products, arguing that Delhi's continued purchases of Russian oil helped fund the war in Ukraine - an accusation India denies.Putin's visit comes as the US holds a series of talks with Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to broker a peace deal to end the war. On Thursday, Putin told India Today that Russia was working on a \"peaceful solution\" to ending the war - warning that Ukraine must withdraw from the Donbas or Russia would seize it.\"Either we liberate these territories by force, or Ukrainian troops will leave these territories,\" he said. Modi repeated India's stance that it was not neutral on the war in Ukraine and stood on \"the side of peace\", welcoming efforts to find a \"lasting\" solution to end the war. He highlighted that increasing the \"connectivity\" of Russia and India was a \"major priority\" for India.In recent months, India-US ties have hit an all-time low as the two countries have failed to resolve the tariff deadlock. Trump initially imposed a 25% tariff on India, but announced an additional 25% later as a penalty for Delhi's purchase of Russian oil - a move the Indian government called \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable\" at the time.  In his interview with India Today, Putin commented on the US tariffs on India for buying Russian oil, and said that India should have the same opportunities available as the US.\"The United States itself still buys nuclear fuel from us for its own nuclear power plants. If the US has the right to buy our fuel, why shouldn't India have the same privilege?,\" he asked.Russia remained the US' top supplier of nuclear reactor fuel last year, Bloomberg reported in September - citing data from the Department of Energy. A ban on enriched uranium imports from the country was enshrined into law in May.  The two leaders exchanged memorandums during Friday's briefing, outlining mutual objectives in areas including trade and agriculture.Modi announced two new 30-day visa schemes for Russian tourists visiting India, and said that two new Indian consulates had opened in Russia.Russia Today, a Kremlin-funded, state-controlled TV network, would also be launched in India, the prime minister said.No major defence deals were announced, but the two men said there were agreements signed on shipbuilding, investments in civil nuclear energy and critical minerals.India and Russia also agreed on an economic programme valid until 2030, the leaders said, spanning jobs, shipping and the health industry.Putin said he was confident about increasing current bilateral trade from $60bn to $100bn in the coming years.Modi said that \"energy security has been a strong and important pillar of the India-Russia partnership\", but made no specific reference to oil.India - the world's third largest consumer of crude oil - has been buying large volumes from Russia since the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.But some Indian firms have already started reducing oil imports from Russia to comply with US sanctions.Putin also referenced a \"flagship project\": building India's largest nuclear power plant, that he said Moscow would help with.In a joint statement released after their meeting, the leaders said their partnership was being \"reoriented toward joint research and development, as well as the production of advanced defence platforms\".Putin added that he and Modi were cooperating on foreign policy, with their coalition of Brics countries promoting a \"more just\" and \"multi-polar\" world. Brics is an informal alliance of several major developing countries - including India, Russia, China, Brazil and South Africa - which formed in 2006, broadly to challenge the political and economic power of North America and Western European nations.",

    "body": "A prominent Palestinian militia leader in Gaza who opposed Hamas has been killed.Yasser Abu Shabab headed the so-called Popular Forces group, which has dozens of fighters and operates in Israeli-controlled territory near the southern city of Rafah.The Popular Forces said in a statement that Abu Shabab was shot while \"attempting to resolve a dispute\" between members of the Abu Seneima family. It dismissed as \"misleading\" reports that he was killed by Hamas, which had accused him of collaborating with Israel.An earlier statement from Abu Shabab's Bedouin tribe, the Tarabin, said he had been killed \"at the hands of the resistance\", and accused him of betraying the Palestinian people.Other sources said his death was the result of an internal power struggle.A Hamas statement said the \"fate that befell\" Abu Shabab was \"the inevitable fate of all who betray their people and homeland and are content to be tools in the hands of the occupation [Israel]\", without claiming involvement in his killing.Israel's Army Radio cited a security source as saying that Abu Shabab had died of his wounds after being evacuated to Soroka hospital in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba. But the hospital denied that he died under their care.The statement from the Popular Forces pledged to continue on Abu Shabab's \"path until the last terrorist is eliminated from the soil of Gaza and a bright and secure future is built for our people, who believe in peace\".In June, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that Israel was arming Palestinian clans in Gaza that he said were opposed to Hamas.It came after Israeli media reported that he had authorised the supply of weapons to the Popular Forces. However, the militia denied that it was being armed by Israel.The Popular Forces have been accused of looting humanitarian aid trucks sent into Gaza during the war, which the militia has also denied. Reports in Israel have also suggested that two of its members have previous links to the Islamic State group (IS).Since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began almost eight weeks ago, Abu Shabab had reportedly been one of several anti-Hamas militia leaders jostling for position in the second phase of US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan.It would involve setting up an interim government, deploying an international stabilisation force, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, and the disarmament of Hamas.Under the first phase, Hamas agreed to return all 48 living and dead hostages it was still holding in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails, as well as a partial Israeli withdrawal and a surge in humanitarian aid.The body of one dead Israeli hostage is yet to be returned.Israel's government has previously said it would not join talks on the second phase until Hamas has returned all the hostages. However, Trump said on Wednesday that the second phase was \"going to happen pretty soon\".The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 70,120 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "6 hours agoRachel ClunBusiness reporterBloomberg via Getty ImagesNetflix has agreed to buy the film and streaming businesses of Warner Bros Discovery for $72bn (£54bn) in a major Hollywood deal.The streaming giant emerged as the successful bidder for Warner Bros ahead of rivals Comcast and Paramount Skydance after a drawn-out battle.Warner Bros owns franchises including Harry Potter and Game of Thrones, and the streaming service HBO Max.The takeover is set to create a new giant in the entertainment industry, but the deal will still have to be approved by competition authorities.Some in the film industry, including the Writers Guild of America, have criticised the deal, saying it would negatively impact workers and consumers.Netflix co-chief executive Ted Sarandos said the streamer was \"highly confident\" it would receive the regulatory approval it needs and it was running \"full speed\" towards this. He said that by combining the library of Warner Bros shows and movies with the streaming platform's series such as Stranger Things, \"we can give audiences more of what they love and help define the next century of storytelling\".\"Warner Bros have defined the last century of entertainment, and together we can define the next one,\" he said.Asked whether HBO should remain a separate streaming service, co-chief executive Greg Peters said Netflix believed the HBO brand was important for consumers, but added: \"We think it's quite early to get into the specifics of how we're going to tailor this offering for consumers.\"Netflix estimates it will find $2bn to $3bn in savings, mostly through eliminating overlaps in the support and technology areas of the businesses.Films made by Warner Bros will continue to be launched in cinemas, it said, and Warner Bros television studio will continue to be able to produce for third parties. Netflix will keep producing content exclusively for its own platform.Murray Close/Getty ImagesWarner Bros owns the rights to the Harry Potter filmsLabelling it a \"big day\" for the companies, Mr Sarandos acknowledged the acquisition may have surprised some shareholders but it was a \"rare opportunity\" to set Netflix up for success \"for decades to come\".David Zaslav, president and chief executive of Warner Bros, added the agreement would combine \"two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world\".\"By coming together with Netflix, we will ensure people everywhere will continue to enjoy the world's most resonant stories for generations to come,\" he said.The cash and stock deal is worth $27.75 per Warner Bros share, with a total enterprise value - which includes the company's debts and the value of its shares - of about $82.7bn. The equity value, or cash price, is $72bn.The boards of directors from each company unanimously approved the deal.Some in the film industry have criticised the agreement.The Writers Guild of America's East and West branches issued a joint statement on Friday saying \"this merger must be blocked\".\"The outcome would eliminate jobs, push down wages, worsen conditions for all entertainment workers, raise prices for consumers, and reduce the volume and diversity of content for all viewers,\" it said.  Michael O'Leary, chief executive of trade organisation Cinema United, said the merger posed \"an unprecedented threat\" to the global cinema business.\"The negative impact of this acquisition will impact theatres from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world,\" he said.Netflix will complete the takeover after Warner Bros finalises its previously announced plans to separate its streaming and studios division from its global networks division into two companies next year.Its global networks division will become Discovery Global and will include its cable channels such as CNN and TNT Sports in the US, as well as its Discovery and free-to-air channels in Europe. However, TNT Sports International will stay with the streaming and studios division being sold to Netflix.Hollywood shake-upPaolo Pescatore, founder and technology media and telecom analyst at PP Foresight, said the sale was \"a huge statement of intent and underlines Netflix aspirations to be a global leader in the new world order of streaming\".But he warned that while the \"surprising move\" made sense for Warner Bros, it could \"provide a headache for Netflix\" when trying to combine the companies given the size of the deal.While the agreed deal is for part of the Warner Bros business, rival Paramount had tabled a bid to buy the whole company, including its cable networks, in October. Warner Bros rejected this move before putting itself up for sale.Ahead of the announcement of the deal, Tom Harrington, head of television at Enders Analysis, said it was hard to gauge whether the takeover would be approved by regulators, but if it went through it would have a massive impact on cinema.\"Were it to go through it would reorient Hollywood,\" he said.Mr Harrington said there was likely to be \"big reductions\" in television and film output from a newly-merged company, which would lead to resistance to the move from parts of Hollywood and relevant unions.For consumers, Mr Harrington said a merger was likely to lead to higher prices.\"Netflix would get more expensive and even though HBO Max would be shuttered/become non-essential, the greater penetration of Netflix households would likely mean an increase in total overall subscription revenues.\"Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said Netflix had \"offered an olive branch\" to Hollywood with the promise it would continue to release Warner Bros films on the big screen.\"If this deal can clear those significant regulatory hurdles quickly there are likely to be considerable cost savings to be made,\" she said. \"How much of those savings get passed to streaming platform subscribers or whether Netflix will be seen to have too much pricing power is one of the areas that will face a huge amount of scrutiny in the coming months.\"With additional reporting by Natalie Sherman",

    "body": "2 hours agoSakshi Venkatraman,US reporterandHarry SekulichREUTERS/Mike Blake/File PhotoFrank Gehry, one of the most influential architects of the last century, has died aged 96.Gehry was acclaimed for his avant garde, experimental style of architecture. His titanium-covered design of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, catapulted him to fame in 1997. His breakthrough in the architectural world came years earlier when he redesigned his own home in Santa Monica, California, using materials like chain-link fencing, plywood, and corrugated steel.His death was confirmed by his chief of staff Meaghan Lloyd. He is survived by two daughters from his first marriage, Leslie and Brina, as well as his wife, Berta Isabel Aguilera, and their two sons, Alejandro and Samuel.Getty ImagesThe Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, one of Gehry's most famous worksBorn in Toronto in 1929, Gehry moved to Los Angeles as a teenager to study architecture at the University of Southern California, before completing further study at the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 1956 and 1957.After starting his own firm, he broke from traditional architectural principles of symmetry, using unconventional geometric shapes and unfinished materials in a style now known as deconstructivism. Through blending unexpected materials and sheathing buildings in stainless steel to create curvy exteriors, Gehry created buildings that took on arresting sculptural shapes.Later in his career, Gehry used 3D modelling similar to that used by aerospace engineers to shape windy buildings, a practice largely avoided by other architects because of the complexity and costliness of construction.In 1989, at the age of 60, Gehry was awarded the industry's top accolade, the Pritzker Architecture prize, for lifetime achievement.The Pritzker jury said his work possessed a \"highly refined, sophisticated and adventurous aesthetic\".\"His designs, if compared to American music, could best be likened to Jazz, replete with improvisation and a lively unpredictable spirit,\" the panel said at the time.Gehry's international breakthrough with the Guggenheim transformed the city of Bilbao, boosting tourism to the city and the local economy. Crafted out of titanium sheets, limestone, and glass, the museum was instantly celebrated as a modern marvel.Architect Philip Johnson, Gehry's American contemporary, described the structure as \"the greatest building of our time\". Other cities tried to replicate its success, branded the \"Bilbao effect\", where investment in daring art could revitalise ailing economies.The cultural phenomenon was parodied in a 2005 episode of The Simpsons, in which the fictional town of Springfield invites Gehry, who voiced himself in the cartoon TV show, to design a new concert hall. In the episode, the shape of the concert hall is jokingly inspired by a letter Gehry had scrunched up.The guest appearance later \"haunted\" Gehry, who told the Observer in 2011 that people sincerely believed his real-life designs were inspired by crumpled paper instead of complex computations.'Pushing the envelope'His work in Bilbao put him in high demand, and he went on to design iconic structures in cities all over the world: the Jay Pritzker Pavilion in Chicago's Millennium Park, the Gehry Tower in Germany, and the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris. \"He bestowed upon Paris and upon France his greatest masterpiece,\" said Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH, the worlds largest luxury goods company which owns Louis Vuitton.With a largely unpredictable style, no two of his works look the same. Prague's Dancing House, finished in 1996, looks like a glass building folding in on itself; his Hotel Marques in Spain, built in 2006, features thin sheets of wavy, multicoloured metal; his design for a business school in Sydney looks like a brown paper bag.Gehry also designed the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, layered in metal resembling sails billowing in the wind. After it opened in 2003, critics described it as a \"pile of broken crockery\", a \"fortune cookie gone berserk\" and an \"emptied waste basket\".In a 2007 interview with the New Yorker, Gehry shrugged off the concert hall's critics: \"At least they're looking!\" he quipped. Tributes are celebrating his eagerness to discard convention - and forge his own creative legacy.Paul Goldberger, author of Building Art: The Life and Work of Frank Gehry, came to know Gehry closely, and said he wanted to work \"until the day he died\".\"He was one of the very few architects of our time to engage people emotionally,\" Goldberger told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight.\"He was all about pushing the envelope... wanting to use the most advanced technology to do the most adventurous things.\"In a statement, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney extended his \"deepest condolences\" to Gehry's family and the \"many admirers of his work\". He added: \"His unmistakable vision lives on in iconic buildings around the world.\"Bilbao's Guggenheim Museum posted a video tribute to Gehry.\"We will be forever grateful,\" the museum wrote on Instagram, \"his spirit and legacy will always remain connected to Bilbao\".",

    "body": "1 day agoBrandon DrenonAj AwerAj Awer, of the Cedar-Riverside Community Council, says Trump's comments were \"dangerous\"Somali-Americans in Minnesota have described their heightened fear after US President Donald Trump intensified his criticism of the community this week.Community leaders told the BBC the \"apprehension is palpable\" following Trump's remarks, in which he said he did not want Somalis in the US and the country would \"go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage\".\"When you're being targeted by the president of the United States, it's not really a good feeling,\" said Aj Awed, executive director of the Cedar-Riverside Community Council, which represents a town known as Little Mogadishu for its large Somali population.Concern has also intensified because of reports that officials have begun an enforcement operation in Minnesota targeting undocumented immigrants.Mr Awed said the council would discuss the risks of holding an annual event scheduled for next week in-person because of the operation.\"The people that are getting caught up in this are people who don't speak that great of English, but who have been citizens for decades,\" he said. \"Just because you have an accent does not make you less American.\"Trump made disparaging comments criticising the Somali community at the White House on Tuesday. \"I don't want them in our country, I'll be honest with you… their country is no good for a reason,\"he said.Mr Awed said the comments were \"dangerous\", adding it was \"not becoming of a president to be just attacking other Americans\".He also expressed concerns of violence that could follow.\"When the president puts a bull's eye on the immigrant community here\", that could encourage others to become \"more radicalised\", he said.President Trump's comments came after he was questioned about large-scale fraud in Minnesota's social assistance programme.Watch: Trump says he 'doesn't want' Somali migrants in USDozens of people have been charged over a scheme that federal prosecutors say involved a charity fraudulently billing the Minnesota government for meals for children during the Covid-19 pandemic. A number of Somali immigrants were implicated in that alleged scheme, which ultimately cost the state tens of millions of dollars, according to Kayseh Magan, a former investigator in Minnesota's attorney general's office.While those accused of involvement represent a small fraction of Minnesota's large Somali population, Trump has repeatedly criticised the community, writing in a post last month that the state has become a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity\".The House Oversight Committee said on Wednesday it was opening an investigation into Minnesota Governor Tim Walz's handling of the allegations.'Anyone who looks like me is scared' Jamal Osman, a member of the Minneapolis City Council, moved to the US when he was 14 and is a naturalised citizen. \"Anyone who looks like me [is] scared right now,\" he told CBS News.Of the fraud allegations that Trump has repeatedly referenced in his criticism of the Somali community, Osman said: \"My community is upset. Yes, people commit crimes, but an entire community should not be blamed based on what some individuals did.\"The Trump administration has ended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) - a programme for immigrants from countries in crisis - for Somali residents living in Minnesota.It said its enforcement operation would target those who have been issued final deportation orders. That operation began on Wednesday,  according to the BBC's US partner, CBS News.Abdilatif HassanKowsar Mohamed says Trump's comments have led to increased concern\"ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) is already here,\" said Kowsar Mohamed, who lives in south Minneapolis. The city is home to more than 80,000 people of Somali descent.\"We're seeing boots on the ground activity where folks are just being plucked off of the streets and being asked about their residency status. That's not a data informed approach,\" she said.\"Most folks have the identification necessary, so the fear is not around proof. The fear is around mistakes happening.\"There have been numerous reports of masked federal officers detaining US citizens and other lawful residents - over 170 instances, according to a ProPublica investigation in October.Social media videos filled with images of ICE agents smashing suspect's car windows and throwing them to the ground during detainments add to immigrants' fears, whether undocumented or not.A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, denied that any people would be targeted based on race.\"Every day, ICE enforces the laws of the nation across the country,\" said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. \"What makes someone a target of ICE is not their race or ethnicity, but the fact that they are in the country illegally.\"Local community organisations had been anticipating increased immigration enforcement, but after Trump's comments they ramped up preparations, Ms Mohamed said. One organisation, Monarca, has scheduled \"legal observer training\" in Minneapolis to educate people on their rights when witnessing federal immigration activity. Other ways the community is bracing itself, Ms Mohamed said, is by having emergency contacts ready-to-go in case of ICE encounters, and private messaging groups where people share photos of unmarked cars and masked agents.\"Everyone is just going to be in the space of caution,\" she said. \"Is there fear? Absolutely. But no one is tucking behind their tail.\" ",

    "body": "1 day agoKelly NgGetty ImagesThe devastating Tai Po fire has sparked an outpouring of grief and anger in Hong KongWhen university student Miles Kwan launched a petition demanding answers from Hong Kong authorities after one of the city's deadliest fires last week, he was arrested.The ferocious blaze had ravaged a densely populated housing estate in the northern Tai Po district, killing at least 159 people and displacing thousands.As public anger grew, the pro-Beijing authorities warned, repeatedly, against attempts to \"exploit\" the fire to \"endanger national security\".Kwan was reportedly arrested by Hong Kong national security police on suspicion of sedition. He is now on bail, according to local media.Police told the BBC that it \"would handle any action taken in accordance with the law and the actual circumstances\".There was also a strong public reaction to the arrest. To some, the decision to arrest him was \"baffling\". To others, it was simply Beijing's playbook, replicated. The Hong Kong government says that it's about trying to protect rule of law in a testing moment for the city. 'A human response to tragedy'Ronny Tong, a member of Hong Kong's Executive Council, disputed the suggestion that Hong Kongers are being suppressed. \"The government is trying to be prudent,\" he tells the BBC.Regina Ip, another Hong Kong lawmaker, also defended the arrests. Authorities are being \"extra careful\" that public anger does not led to a \"recurrence of the 2019 riots\", she told the BBC's Newshour radio programme.Among the questions in the petition and being asked by many Hong Kongers include how the blaze could have swept through the buildings so rapidly and whether any government officials should be held responsible.\"You have to differentiate genuine expressions of opinion from petitions with criminal intent. That is what our courts will have to find out,\" Ip added.Kwan's petition, which listed \"four demands\" - echoing the \"five demands, not one less\" slogan that rallied protesters in 2019 - gathered more than 10,000 signatures in less than a day before it was taken down. Days later, the city's leader John Lee said Hong Kong would \"go all out\" to support victims and investigate the blaze. He anounced a number of actions such as the convening of an independent committee to investigate the fire, a review of the building works system, and temporary accommodation and financial aid to victims. Many of these were what people were calling for already - and they also formed a part of Kwan's petition. \"It's baffling how Miles was [arrested] for asking basic questions on behalf of many residents, which the government went on to address anyway,\" said Samuel Chu, a pro-democracy activist who reposted Kwan's petition on a separate platform.\"This is not a political campaign. It's a human response to the tragedy,\" he said.Getty ImagesAmong the questions residents want answered include whether any government officials should be held responsibleIn the past week, authorities have also arrested 15 people on suspicion of manslaughter and ordered the removal of mesh netting from all buildings undergoing renovations after investigators found that the one wrapped around the charred complex did not meet flame retardant standards.Separately, one woman has been arrested for trying to profiteer from the crisis using a fake fundraising campaign.China's national security office in Hong Kong swung into action swiftly after last week's disaster, warning that it would take action against anyone trying to instigate \"black terror\" - a phrase Beijing had used to describe the 2019 protests.In a more strongly-worded statement this week, it vowed to punish \"hostile foreign forces... no matter how far away\" they may be.Lee, Hong Kong's chief executive, said he would \"ensure justice is [served]\" to anyone who tries to \"sabotage\" relief efforts.Former district councillor Kenneth Cheung, who was among those arrested reportedly by national security police, says authorities took issue with content he re-shared on Facebook following the fire.\"The Tai Po fire is a tragedy that concerns everyone in Hong Kong. Many, regardless of their political loyalties, want the culprits to be held accountable,\" says the 50-year-old, who is out on bail but has had his passport impounded.\"Not everything is about politics,\" Cheung says.Hong Kong authorities are dealing with this disaster using Beijing's playbook, which focuses on social control and regime security, alleges Kenneth Chan, a politics professor at the Hong Kong Baptist University.He notes how authorities have over the weekend displaced community-led relief initiatives with groups backed by the government.\"Officials will not embrace the spontaneity of these grassroots efforts because they want control,\" he alleges.On social media in HK comments piled in responding to the arrest. Most of them unhappy over the arrests and the government response. \"Demanding the truth is considered incitement?\" one such comment said. Getty ImagesJohn Lee says Hong Kong will \"ensure justice is [served]\" to anyone who tries to \"sabotage\" relief effortsAsked at a news conference earlier this week why he deserves to keep his job following the fire, John Lee sidestepped the question and instead pledged to take to task \"anybody who dares to sabotage\" relief efforts.No government official has yet resigned nor been arrested over the fire. The 15 people arrested on suspicion of manslaughter are bosses or staff of construction firms, while another six detained are fire equipment contractors. Some residents have also criticised the decision to proceed with a Legislative Council election, at a time when the city is in mourning. Only pro-Beijing \"patriots\" are allowed to contest in the poll which will be held on Sunday.The issue however, is continuing to dominate discussion at all levels. Some Legislative Council members made a request for an emergency debate to discuss the fire and post disaster relief work, but this was refused, with the government saying it would keep its focus on the issue of the fire itself.In a statement to reporters Lee said, \"Yes, it is a tragedy; it is a big fire. Yes, we need a reform. Yes, we have identified failures in different stages. That is exactly why we must act seriously to ensure that all these loopholes are plugged... to ensure that such things will not happen again.\"(5 December 2025): This article and headline were updated to add more precise attribution over the basis of arrests and that Kwan is now out on bail, include a police response to the BBC and add more context about public and government reaction.",

    "body": "Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, has voted to introduce voluntary military service, in a move aimed at boosting national defences after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.It marks a significant shift in Germany's approach to its military and follows Chancellor Friedrich Merz's push to create Europe's strongest conventional army.The change means that all 18-year-olds in Germany will be sent a questionnaire from January 2026 asking if they are interested and willing to join the armed forces. The form will be mandatory for men and voluntary for women.Students at schools across Germany have said they will join strikes in as many as 90  cities on Friday to protest against the move.Many young Germans either oppose the new law or are sceptical.\"We don't want to spend half a year of our lives locked up in barracks, being trained in drill and obedience and learning to kill,\" the organisers of the protests wrote in a statement posted on social media.\"War offers no prospects for the future and destroys our livelihoods.\"In Hamburg alone, about 1,500 people were expected to join the protests, and school head teachers warned parents not to take their children out of school for the day.German MPs voted by 323 votes to 272 to back the change, making their country the latest European country to launch some form of revised military service. Last month, France said it was introducing 10 months of voluntary military training for 18- and 19-year-olds.The government says military service will be voluntary for as long as possible, but from July 2027, all 18-year-old men will have to take a medical exam to assess their fitness for possible military service.Universal medical examinations were necessary, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said, so that in the event of an attack, Germany would not waste time determining \"who is operationally capable as a homeland protector and who is not\".Germany's armed forces, the Bundeswehr, currently have around 182,000 service personnel, and Pistorius wants to increase that number by 20,000 over the next year.The long-term aim is to raise the number by the early 2030s to 260,000, supplemented by approximately 200,000 reservists, to meet new Nato force targets and strengthen Germany's defences.While the plan is for voluntary service, if the security situation worsens or if too few volunteers came forward, a form of compulsory military service could be considered by the Bundestag.If war were to break out, the military would be able to draw on the questionnaires and medical exams for potential recruits.Like other European countries, Germany ran down its armed forces during the peacetime years of the 1990s. During the Cold War it had an army of almost half a million.Compulsory military service in Germany was ended in 2011 under former chancellor Angela Merkel.But now, in the face of perceived threats from Russia and heavy pressure from Germany's traditional ally, the US, Friedrich Merz has pledged to rebuild the Bundeswehr into Europe's strongest conventional army.Nato countries have come under pressure from US President Donald Trump's White House to increase their spending on defence.Incentives for voluntary service are relatively high, with a promised salary of about €2,600 a month. In France, volunteers will be paid at least €800 (£700) a month.The Bundestag was also set to vote on Friday on a contentious pensions reform bill, which will keep the state pension at current levels until 2031.The bill is a key pillar of the coalition deal between Merz's conservatives and his centre-left partner, the Social Democrats, who have just a slender governing majority of just 12 votes.However, there had been doubts about whether it would pass the parliamentary vote, as  younger members of Merz's conservatives threatened to rebel. They say the plan is financially unsustainable and will leave younger generations shouldering the burden.But Germany's opposition far-left Left party said it would abstain from voting, which means the coalition needs fewer votes to pass it and so won't have to worry about potential rebels from its own ranks.A government crisis may narrowly have been averted.",

    "body": "Olympian and other Eritreans freed after 18 years without trial, relatives tell the BBC14 hours agoTeklemariam BekitEditor, BBC TigrinyaThirteen people held for more than 18 years without trial in Eritrea have been released from a notorious military prison, relatives of the detainees have told the BBC.Among those freed were several prominent figures, including 69-year-old Olympian cyclist and businessman Zeragaber Gebrehiwot.They had been held at Mai Serwa prison, known for its harsh conditions and where many of the inmates are believed to be political prisoners.An unnamed source who was once detained in Mai Serwa told the BBC the prisoners were arrested in October 2007 following an assassination attempt on Col Simon Gebredingil, a senior internal security officer in President Isaias Afwerki's government.Around 30 people were initially detained, according to the source. Some have been released over the years, but about 20 remained in custody.Zeragaber competed in the Moscow Olympics in 1980 when Eritrea was part of Ethiopia.The mountainous country, which gained its independence from Ethiopia in 1993, has a strong cycling culture and its cyclists have steadily gained international recognition over the past decade.Those released with Zeragaber on Thursday include prominent businessmen Tesfalem Mengsteab and Bekure Mebrahtu as well as the Habtemariam brothers - David, an engineer, and Matthews, a geometrist.Six senior police officers and an internal security agent were also freed.The Eritrean government has not issued any statement regarding the releases.Many of them are sick and this could explain why they have been released now.Families were not allowed to visit the prisoners throughout their detention, the relatives said.The UN and human rights groups have long accused the Eritrean government of gross human rights violations, including torture, forced disappearance and the imprisonment of tens of thousands of people in inhumane conditions.Mai Serwa prison, located about 9km (six miles) north-west of the capital, Asmara, has expanded over the years to include 20 metal shipping containers in which prisoners are held incommunicado, sources have told the BBC.Last year, Berhane Abrehe, who served as President Isaias's finance minister for 11 years until 2012, died in prison. He had spent six years in jail - detained after releasing a book in which he described the president as a \"dictator\" who needed to resign.He was also never taken to court. According to UK-based Human Rights Concern - Eritrea, he died in Asmara's Carshelli prison.Over the last three decades, Eritrea has remained a one-party state with no functioning constitution. It is one of the most militarised societies in the world, with indefinite military conscription.There has been no free press since the closure of independent newspapers and arrest of most of their editors and journalists in 2001.This was when the government arrested 15 politicians known as the G-15, along with 16 journalists, after they demanded that President Isaias implement the draft constitution and hold open elections.According to Amnesty International, the fate and whereabouts of 11 of the politicians, as well as the journalists accused of links to the G-15, remain unknown.Aged 79, President Isaias marked 32 years in power earlier this year and has still never faced an election.",

    "body": "1 day agoAlice CuddySenior international reporterThe parents of the last dead hostage in Gaza have spoken to the BBC about their desperate wait for his body to be returned.Itzik and Talik Gvili insisted the Gaza peace deal could not progress until Hamas handed over the remains of their son Ran, a 24-year-old Israeli police officer also known as Rani.\"We really hope that all people in the world... want to end this situation and go to the second phase, so Hamas must bring Rani home,\" his mother Talik said, after Israel confirmed the body of Thai national Suthisak Rintalak had been returned on Wednesday.He and Ran were among 251 people taken hostage in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, when another 1,200 people were killed.Ran was killed while fighting Hamas gunmen in Kibbutz Alumim, and his body was subsequently taken to Gaza as a hostage, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).His parents said he was on medical leave with a broken shoulder at the time of the attacks but went to fight after seeing on television what was happening.\"He couldn't stay at home even though he was injured. He took my car and his uniform... and went to help in the fight against the terrorists,\" said his father Itzik.\"He saved Kibbutz Alumim... and he saved Israel, so Israel has to save him now and bring him back home,\" he added.While the couple have been told by Israeli officials that Ran was killed, they say they are still holding onto \"a little percent\" of hope \"that maybe he's alive, maybe he's survived\".\"We want closure,\" said Talik.Speaking during a visit to London, Ran's parents described their pain over the past 26 months, much of which they have spent campaigning for the return of all the living and dead hostages.Under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the final 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza, but it has taken weeks for the bodies of the dead hostages to be returned, often only one at a time.\"When Hamas bring one of the hostages home we don't know who it is, maybe it's Rani, maybe it's someone else… It's like roulette. You cannot imagine the fright and the hope and everything. Sometimes it's not a hostage\" at all, said Talik, referring to  several sets of remains handed over that have turned out to belong to dead Palestinians.\"My wish is that no mother will feel what I feel in the whole world. We are strong people, but what is inside, you cannot imagine… They stole my child and I can do nothing - just pray and come to visit people and beg for help.\"Talik said she had not slept for a full night since 7 October 2023.\"You feel that you have 5,000 kilos on your chest. We don't have night. We don't have day. We have nothing,\" she said.While they are now the only people in Israel waiting for a loved one to be returned from Gaza, they said the support around them has grown.\"All the families are together with us and all Israeli people are with us. It [the support] is bigger than before because all Israeli people are now focused on one thing - bring Ran home and then do the second phase [of the peace deal],\" said Talik.The couple said that after Ran's return, they hoped for lasting peace and for Hamas to be dismantled.\"We are very proud of Ran. He's a hero in Israel. Hamas made Ran a hero... We want him back and to try to sleep well and breathe well again.\"Earlier on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also described Ran as a \"hero of Israel\", saying he had \"eliminated 14 terrorists and did so with the utmost bravery\" before being killed in battle.\"We are determined to bring Ran back for a proper Jewish burial and we will spare no effort to do so,\" he vowed.Israel responded to the 7 October 2023 attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 70,120 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

That's where most of the animals live. So obviously, if you're removing the sediment, you're removing the animals in it too,\" lead author Eva Stewart, PhD student at the Natural History Museum and the University of Southampton, told BBC News.Natural History Museum/University of GothenburgThe scientists catalogued all the animals they found in the sediment, including this worm\"Even if they are not killed by the machine, pollution from the mining operations could slowly kill some less resilient species,\" said Dr Guadalupe Bribiesca-Contreras from the National Oceanography Centre.A few of the animals could have moved away, but \"whether or not they come back after disturbance is a different question\", she added.However, in the areas near the vehicle tracks, where clouds of sediment landed, the abundance of animals did not decrease.\"We were expecting possibly a bit more impact, but [we didn't] see much, just a shift in which species were dominant over others,\" Dr Adrian Glover, research scientist at the Natural History Museum, told BBC News.Natural History Museum/University of GothenburgAn abyssal sea spider was another of macrofauna found during the research\"​We're ​encouraged ​by these ​data,\" a spokesperson for The Metals Company told BBC News.\"After ​years ​of ​activist ​alarm ​that ​our ​impacts ​would ​spread ​thousands ​of ​kilometers ​beyond ​the ​mine ​site, ​the ​data ​show ​that ​any ​biodiversity ​impacts ​are ​limited ​to ​the ​directly ​mined ​area,\" they added. But some experts do not think that this is good news for mining companies.\"I think the study shows that current technologies for harvesting are too damaging to permit large-scale commercial exploration,\" Dr Patrick Schröder, senior research fellow at the Environment and Society Centre at think tank Chatham House, told BBC News.\"These were only tests and the impact was significant. If they did that at large scale, it would be even more damaging,\" he added.Deep sea mining is controversial. At the heart of the debate is a difficult problem.The latest research took place in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a 6m sq km area of the Pacific Ocean estimated to hold over 21bn tonnes of nickel, cobalt and copper-rich polymetallic nodules.The world needs these critical minerals for renewable energy technologies to tackle climate change. They are essential components in solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles, for example.The International Energy Agency predicts that demand for the minerals could at least double by 2040.The minerals have to come from somewhere, but some scientists and environmental groups are gravely concerned that mining the deep seas could cause untold damage.Natural History Museum/University of GothenburgAn abyssal sea star was also found during the researchSome fear that before we have the chance to explore the full nature of life in the undiscovered deep ocean, it could be endangered. Oceans play a critical role in regulating our planet and are already at severe risk from rising temperatures.The International Seabed Authority (ISA), which governs activity in international waters, has not yet approved commercial mining although it has issued 31 licences for exploration.A total of 37 countries, including the UK and France, are backing a temporary ban on mining.This week Norway postponed mining plans in its waters including the Arctic.But in April, US President Donald Trump called for domestic and international projects to be fast-tracked, as the US wants to secure the supply of minerals for use in weapons.If the ISA concludes that current mining techniques are too destructive, companies could try to develop less intrusive ways of extracting nodules from the seafloor.The research is published in the scientific journal Nature ​Ecology ​and ​Evolution.",

    "body": "1 day agoMark SavageMusic correspondentEPAIreland, Spain, the Netherlands and Slovenia will boycott the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest, after it was decided Israel could compete. They were among a number of countries who had called for Israel to be excluded over the war in Gaza and accusations of unfair voting practices.But at a meeting in Geneva where a vote was held on new safeguards, a \"large majority\" of members agreed there was no need for a further vote on participation and that Eurovision 2026 could proceed as planned, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said.Spanish broadcaster RTVE, which had led calls for a secret ballot on the issue, said the decision had increased its \"distrust of the festival's organisation\".Ireland's RTÉ said it felt that its \"participation remains unconscionable given the appalling loss of lives in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis there which continues to put the lives of so many civilians at risk.\"Watch: Which countries are boycotting Eurovision and why?Spain is one of Eurovision's \"Big Five\" countries along with France, Germany, Italy and the UK. Their artists are allowed straight into the final, as their broadcasters provide the largest financial contribution to the EBU. Approximately 50 broadcasters, including the BBC, attended an EBU meeting on Thursday to discuss the future of the contest, which is watched by more than 150 million people each year.They were asked to back new rules intended to discourage governments and third parties from organising voting campaigns for their acts, after allegations that Israel unfairly boosted its entrant, Yuval Raphael, this year.BBC News understands that voting to accept those measures was tied to a clause whereby members agreed not to proceed with a vote on Israel's participation.\"This vote means that all EBU Members who wish to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest 2026 and agree to comply with the new rules are eligible to take part,\" the EBU said.ReutersSinger Yuval Raphael, who survived the 7 October Hamas attack in 2023, represented Israel at this year's EurovisionGetty ImagesAustrian singer JJ won May's contest in Basel, Switzerland, toppling Israel from pole position at the last minuteMartin Green, director of the Eurovision Song Contest, said he was \"pleased\" that members had been given an \"opportunity to debate\" Israel's place in the contest before the vote. \"It was a full, frank and honest and quite moving debate, but as we can see from the emphatic result, they really came together on a belief that the Eurovision Song Contest shouldn't be used as a political theatre, it must retain some sense of neutrality.\"Israel's President Isaac Herzog praised the decision to allow the country to compete, calling it \"an appreciated gesture of solidarity, brotherhood, and co-operation, symbolising a victory over those who seek to silence Israel and spread hatred\".He said he was \"glad that Israel will participate again in Eurovision and I hope that the competition will remain one that sanctifies culture, poetry, and friendship between peoples and cross-border cultural understanding\". He added that Israel \"deserves to be represented on every stage in the world, and I am fully and actively committed to that\".The CEO of Israel's broadcaster, KAN, said the attempt to disqualify its entry \"can only be understood as a cultural boycott.\"A boycott may begin today - with Israel - but no-one knows where it will end or who else it may harm,\" said Golan Yochpaz. \"Is this what we truly want this contest to be remembered for on its 70th anniversary?\"The BBC, which broadcasts Eurovision in the UK, said in a statement: \"We support the collective decision made by members of the EBU. This is about enforcing the rules of the EBU and being inclusive.\"Getty ImagesSpanish singer Melody representing Spain in May's contest, with the song Esa divaHowever, the decision has exposed a deep rift in the Eurovision community. In a statement, Dutch broadcaster Avrotros said that \"participation under the current circumstances is incompatible with the public values ​​that are essential to us\".Spanish broadcaster RTVE added: \"The board of directors of RTVE agreed last September that Spain would withdraw from Eurovision if Israel was part of it.\"\"This withdrawal also means that RTVE will not broadcast the Eurovision 2026 final... nor the preliminary semi-finals.\"Slovenia's broadcaster RTV added that their position also \"remains unchanged\". \"The recent rule changes do not alter our view. As a public service broadcaster, RTV Slovenia is committed to upholding ethical principles and expects that equal rules and standards apply to all EBU members and all participating countries.\"Belgium's broadcaster said it would \"take a position in the coming days\".Those who approved of the changes included Nordic broadcasters from Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Iceland who issued a joint statement saying they \"supported\" the EBU's decision to \"address critical shortcomings\" in the voting system.Despite that, Iceland's RÚV said it would not make a final decision on its participation until next week. Germany, which had threatened to leave the contest if Israel was removed, also welcomed Thursday's decision.Its broadcaster ARD said it was \"looking forward to participating\" next year, \"embracing it as a celebration of cultural diversity and solidarity\". It added: \"At the same time, we deeply regret the decisions of individual EBU members to withdraw from the ESC 2026 but, of course, respect the choices made by the respective broadcasters.\"Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

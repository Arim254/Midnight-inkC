    "body": "13 hours agoJaroslav LukivNurPhoto via Getty ImagesThorbjørn Jagland's lawyer promised his client's full co-operation with the investigationPolice in Norway have opened a corruption investigation into the country's former Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland over his alleged links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. A special Norwegian police unit which is analysing newly released Epstein files in the US said the 75-year-old was suspected of \"aggravated corruption\". Police said they had already asked the country's foreign ministry to lift his immunity, which he enjoys because of his past role as a senior foreign diplomat. Jagland is also a former head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee and spent 10 years as secretary general of the Council of Europe. His lawyer said they would fully co-operate with the investigation.Pål K. Lønseth, head of Økokrim - the economic crime unit investigating Jagland - said: \"We consider there are reasonable grounds for investigation, given that he held the positions of chair of the Nobel Committee and Secretary General of the Council of Europe during the period covered by the released documents.\"Among other things, Økokrim will investigate whether gifts, travel and loans were received in connection with his position.\"The police added that further details would be given \"at a later stage\".Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said it was \"important that the facts of this case are brought to light\".He added that Oslo would ask the Council of Europe for Jagland's immunity to be revoked.Jagland's lawyer Anders Brosveet welcomed the opening of the investigation.\"Based on what we have found so far, we are confident of the outcome,\" he told Reuters news agency. Separately, Brosveet told Norway's VG news site that he and his client would submit \"the key findings and documentation we have to Økokrim as soon as practically possible\".Jagland was Norway's prime minister in 1996-97, and the secretary general of the Council of Europe in 2009-19.He also chaired the Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2009-15.",

    "body": "22 minutes agoLaura CressTechnology reporterGetty ImagesThe EU has told TikTok it must change its \"addictive design\" or face heavy fines, after it found the video sharing platform had breached its online safety rules.It follows an investigation which began in February 2024 into the Chinese-owned app by the European Commission.In its preliminary findings, the Commission said TikTok did not \"adequately assess\" how features like autoplay could harm the wellbeing of its users, including children, and said it failed to implement measures to mitigate the risks.A TikTok spokesperson told the BBC the findings presented a \"categorically false and entirely meritless depiction of our platform\" and it planned to challenge them.The platform has been invited to respond to the EU's findings. Depending on the outcome of this step, the Commission could fine TikTok up to 6% of its total global annual turnover - estimated to be in the tens of billions.EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen told reporters if TikTok wanted to avoid being fined, it would have to \"change the design of their service in Europe\".The Commission gave several suggestions for actions the platform could take, including implementing \"screen time breaks\" when people are using it at night and changing its algorithms which feed users personalised content.It also suggested TikTok disable so-called \"infinite scroll\", which allows people to quickly cycle through millions of videos on the platform.\"The Digital Services Act makes platforms responsible for the effects they can have on their users,\" Virkkunen said.\"In Europe, we enforce our legislation to protect our children and our citizens online.\"",

    "body": "Coin portrait of late Queen draws criticism in Australia 43 minutes agoKathryn ArmstrongRoyal Australian Mint$5 and 50 cent versions of the coin have been released to mark the centenary of Queen Elizabeth II's birthTwo commemorative coins, released by the Royal Australian Mint and bearing a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, have been criticised for their lack of resemblance to the late monarch.The $5 (£2.56) and 50 cent silver coins, created to commemorate the centenary of the Queen's birth, were released in an online ballot that closed on Wednesday.\"That's got to be the most unpleasant portrait on a coin,\" said one of several people who reacted negatively online. The Royal Australian Mint defended the portrait, saying: \"Our coin images don't always capture the full beauty of a design once it's etched in metal.\"Queen Elizabeth II died in 2022 at the age of 96 and was the UK's longest serving monarch. \"There's a reason most portraits are from the side. Looks like she just ran into a wall,\" one person commented underneath a Facebook post from the mint.\"If I saw that face without the hairdo and pearls, would never guess who it was meant to be,\" another said.Comparisons have been made with various TV characters, including Mrs Doubtfire - the beloved fictional housekeeper in the comedy film of the same name, played by the late Robin Williams.Royal Australian MintOther people were more positive about the design, which was created by one of the mint's artists. \"Awesome. I'm glad they put something out to do with Queen Elizabeth II, she deserves to have Recognition In a Special Way,\" one user wrote on social media.\"Please pick me for one of these coins,\" said another. One woman living in the US commented that it \"looks like a beautiful coin\". Despite the criticism, collectors reported that the ballot was fully subscribed. Australian media, quoting a spokesperson for the Royal Australian Mint, said the silver proof coins had sold out, and there were limited stocks left in their contact centre and shop.According to the mint's website, it created 30,000 of the 50c coins and 5,000 of the $5 - all of which are collector's items and will not enter general public circulation.As well as the queen's portrait, the coins feature designs \"symbolically reflecting the many facets of Queen Elizabeth II's life and legacy\", the mint said. These include motifs of a horse and corgi, references to art and theatre to mark \"her enduring support for culture\", as well as some of her favourite flowers - roses and lily of the valley. The golden wattle, Australia's national floral emblem, is also represented. \"The design incorporates Her Majesty's Royal Cypher, a stylised St Edward's Crown and the Auxiliary Territorial Service emblem, acknowledging her wartime service and lifelong sense of duty,\" the mint added.Meanwhile, the backs of the coins feature a portrait of the Queen's son, King Charles, in profile.

    "body": "49 minutes agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorRussian Defence MinistryLt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev is number two in the main directorate of Russia's GRU military intelligenceA high-profile general in Russia's military has been shot several times and wounded in Moscow.Lt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev was immediately taken to hospital after the attack in a residential block of flats on the north-western outskirts of the Russian capital and his condition is unknown.Alexeyev is number two in the main directorate of Russia's GRU military intelligence  and the latest high-ranking military figure to have been targeted in the capital since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began almost four years ago.He was placed under European Union and UK sanctions after the GRU was accused of being behind the 2018 nerve agent attack in Salisbury in the UK.\"The victim has been hospitalised at one of the city's hospitals,\" said Svetlana Petrenko of Russia's Investigations Committee, which said it opened a criminal case for attempted murder.The gunman fled and investigators searched CCTV footage for clues and began interviewing witnesses.A neighbour of Alexeyev told the Reuters news agency she had been woken up by the sound of \"several\" shots and had then heard another neighbour screaming for help.  \"This is all I heard. Other neighbours rushed out, too. They asked how they could help, should they call ambulance and police, but she had already called them.\"Alexeyev has played a significant role during the war in Ukraine, taking part in talks with Ukraine during the Russian siege of the city of Mariupol in 2022. He was also sent to negotiate with the head of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who led a short and bloody mutiny in June 2023.His boss at the GRU, Igor Kostyukov, has been in charge of Russia's negotiating team taking part in talks on security issues with the US and Ukraine in Abu Dhabi.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin was being briefed on the shooting. \"We wish first of all that the general survives and recovers. We hope that will be the case,\" he told reporters.It is not yet known who was behind the shooting on Friday morning in a residential block on Volokolamsk Highway in Moscow but Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused Ukraine. Kyiv has not commented but has claimed some attacks on Russian military figures in the past. Russian intelligence officials claimed they had thwarted an attempted attack on a Russian soldier in St Petersburg at the end of last month.An Uzbek man was jailed in January for the 2024 killing of another general, Igor Kirillov, in an explosion outside a block of flats in Moscow. Ukraine's SBU intelligence had said it was behind the attack.Lt Gen Kirillov had been in charge of Russia's Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection troops.In December 2025, another high-ranking officer in the GRU, Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, was killed when an explosive device detonated under a car in Moscow. He was in charge of the armed force's operational training department, according to Russia's Investigative Committee.",

    "body": "23 minutes agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterGetty ImagesJeweller Pandora has said it will switch from using silver in some of its ranges to platinum-plating following a dramatic increase in prices.Silver prices have more than doubled over the past year with other precious metals such as gold also surging. Pandora's chief executive Berta de Pablos-Barbier said the aim was not to make all jewellery platinum-plated, but silver will be reduced to around 25% of its goods to reduce its exposure to the metal given the recent volatility.The Danish firm, one of the world's biggest jewellery retailers, currently makes the majority of its products from silver.Although platinum is more expensive than silver per ounce, Pandora said it will create an alloy, which would make it cheaper to use.It said over time, parts of its silver ranges will shift to platinum-plated, using its own metal alloy called Evershine, which it already uses for its gold-plated products.Jewellery historian Vivienne Becker, said: \"Platinum has obviously got an elitist image, so people will still get that feeling of preciousness,\" she said, even if it is based on an alloy.She added that there had been a shift by consumers towards white metals after gold prices rose.Pandora said that it would introduce the new platinum-plated range in 2026 before rolling it out more broadly.It added in the short-term it would use third parties to plate its platinum jewellery, before moving to its sites in Thailand and Vietnam. Pandora said it wanted the pivot to platinum to be completed by 2028.Pandora is well known for its charm bracelets. Chief executive de Pablos-Barbier said that around 60% of its business was currently in silver. She told CNBC: \"If you look at our volatility of silver, one of the things that we have to [do] for the company is to decouple that from the silver trading.\"Silver prices hit record highs in January before falling back, but remains elevated compared to last year.The firm said that the surging price had a \"temporary impact on earnings\".Getty ImagesPandora's charm bracelets are one of its most well-known itemsPrecious metals like gold and silver have rallied recently as investors sought so-called \"safe haven\" assets during global geopolitical uncertainty and economic volatility.\"Silver is tied to global economic health,\" said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell.It is used in the manufacture of electronics and medical equipment, solar panels and batteries which means demand for the metal from industry ebbs and flows according to how fast the world's economy is growing.\"",

    "body": "20 hours agoSamantha GranvilleBeirutReutersThe Israeli military declined to comment on the allegationsLebanon has accused Israeli aircraft of spraying an agricultural herbicide over southern villages at concentrations authorities described as dangerously high, raising concerns for food and environmental security.The agriculture and environment ministries said laboratory tests confirmed the substance was glyphosate, a chemical used to destroy vegetation, with concentrations in some samples \"between 20 and 30 times the levels usually accepted\".President Joseph Aoun condemned the spraying of what he described as \"toxic substances\", calling it a violation of Lebanese sovereignty and an environmental and health crime.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC they had no comment on the matter.The purpose behind the release of herbicide on the villages remains unclear.Residents in several border villages reported the spraying, which comes more than a year after a ceasefire ended a war between Israel and the Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah.Earlier in the week, United Nations peacekeepers in Lebanon said they had been notified by Israel of planned spraying near the border and were advised to take shelter.The communication forced them to cancel some of their planned operations. They said this was not the first time Israeli forces had dropped unknown chemical substances from aircraft over Lebanese territory.With tens of thousands still displaced after hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah in 2023-24, the challenges for returning home are compounded, according to Ramzi Kaiss, a researcher with Human Rights Watch in Lebanon.\"These areas are heavily dependent on agriculture - olive groves, tobacco, and other crops - and this incident complicates people's ability to return to their homes, maintain their livelihoods, and rebuild after extensive destruction,\" Kaiss said.Experts warn that incidents like this do not only harm local ecosystems but also have broader economic consequences for Lebanon's farming sector.In April 2025, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization reported that the 2024 conflict had caused more than $700m (£515m; 600m euros ) in damage and losses to Lebanon's agricultural sector, particularly in the south and the Bekaa Valley.Environmental groups like Green Southerners in Lebanon also expressed concern about the impact on agricultural production and soil fertility.\"These actions threaten ecosystems already damaged by white phosphorus, with serious risks to insect communities and natural pollinators, undermining biodiversity, food security, and local livelihoods,\" the group said in an Instagram post.But there's no universal consensus on the risks of glyphosate.The World Health Organization's (WHO) International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies it as \"probably carcinogenic to humans,\" citing a link to non-Hodgkin lymphoma, while other regulatory bodies, including the US Environmental Protection Agency and European Food Safety Authority, have concluded it is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans.The Lebanese foreign ministry said it intended to submit a formal complaint against Israel to the UN Security Council.",

Louvre MuseumOne of the crown's golden eagles is missing but all the emeralds and most of the diamonds remainTwo of the thieves got inside by cutting through the window with power tools. They then threatened the guards, who evacuated the area, and cut through the glass of two display cases housing jewellery that once belonged to French royalty or its imperial rulers.Prosecutors said the thieves were inside for less than four minutes before making their escape on two scooters waiting outside.Police have arrested four male suspects who prosecutors allege are the thieves - but the mastermind behind the raid has not been tracked down.

    "body": "2 hours agoScott DuffieldGetty ImagesThree African countries have agreed to take back foreign offenders and illegal migrants after the UK Home Secretary threatened them with visa penalties.In December - following threats from Shabana Mahmood - Namibia and Angola agreed to cooperate on returns. The home secretary has now also secured cooperation from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\"My message is clear: if foreign governments refuse to accept the return of their citizens, then they will face consequences,\" she said following the agreement.The UK government had previously warned it would stop granting visas to people from Angola, Namibia and the DRC if their governments did not improve co-operation on removals.The Home Office had said that returns from the DRC, Angola and Namibia were being frustrated - with paperwork not being processed or people being required to sign their own documents - giving them an effective veto. It had warned that the three countries faced penalties for their \"unacceptably poor and obstructive returns processes\".While setting out changes to the UK's asylum system in November, Mahmood said visa penalties would be applied to countries that failed to co-operate with returns policies. Penalties included an \"emergency brake\" on visas for countries with high asylum claims until they take back citizens in the UK illegally.Following the agreement with the three countries, Mahmood said: \"Illegal migrants and dangerous criminals will now be removed and deported back to Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\"\"I will do what it takes to secure our order and control to our borders,\" she added.The government says over 3,000 people from these three countries could be eligible to be removed or deported due to the cooperation.In the year ending September 2025, there were 36,475 returns and deportations from the UK, an 11% increase on the previous 12 months. Around 5,000 of the returns were foreign national offenders - 48% came from EU countries and 52% came from non-EU countries.  The Home Secretary has indicated that ​countries which refuse to work with the UK on returns cannot expect a normal visa relationship, with further threats expected for lack of cooperation.It is understood that India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Somalia and Gabon are all resistant to returns deals and it is possible that the government could look at sanctions for those countries.The government hopes that increasing the return of illegal migrants will deter people from trying to get to the UK by crossing the English Channel in small boats. Last year, 41,472 migrants made the journey, a 13% rise on the year before. At the end of last year, European countries including the UK agreed to negotiate a new approach to interpreting the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) to make it easier to deport illegal migrants. The Conservatives have said they would leave the treaty with party leader Kemi Badenoch arguing it was a necessary step to \"protect our borders\". ",

    "body": "19 hours agoJaroslav LukivTelegram / Zelensky / OfficialMany of exchanged Ukrainians had been held in captivity since 2022, Kyiv saidUkraine and Russia have conducted a rare exchange of prisoners of war and civilians after two days of US-brokered peace talks in Abu Dhabi.A total of 157 Ukrainians - seven of them civilians - and 157 Russian soldiers were returned home in the first such swap in four months.Russian, Ukrainian and US teams took part in the talks in the capital of the United Arab Emirates, with the main sticking points believed to be territorial concessions Ukraine is under pressure to make and security guarantees for it to prevent further Russian attacks if a deal is agreed to end the four-year war.No breakthrough has been reported. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the talks had not been easy and he wanted \"faster results\".EPA/ShutterstockThe exchanged Russian soldiers were currently staying in Belarus, the Russian defence ministry saidRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.In a post on social media, Zelensky wrote that Thursday's prisoner exchange \"took place after a long pause\" - referring to the previous such swap last October.\"We are returning our people home - 157 Ukrainians. Soldiers of the Armed Forces, National Guard, State Border Service. And civilians are also returning with the defenders,\" the Ukrainian president said, pledging to bring back every single Ukrainian still in Russian captivity.  Ukrainians officials said 139 had been in Russian captivity since 2022.Meanwhile, the Russian defence ministry said 157 of its POWs were returned by Kyiv.The ministry added that three Russian civilians \"illegally held\" were also handed back. They were residents of the western Kursk region, parts of which were occupied by Ukraine during its incursion in 2024-25.The talks in Abu Dhabi - the second round in recent weeks - are part of US President Donald Trump's efforts to end the war. Special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner have been leading the negotiations. The talks had been \"detailed and productive\", Witkoff wrote on X, but added that \"significant work remains\".The most difficult issue is territory, with Russia demanding that Ukraine cedes the rest of the eastern industrial region of Donbas that Moscow does not currently control.Another key sticking point is believed to be Kyiv's demand to get robust security guarantees from its European allies and the US. No details have been released.  The trilateral talks began as Russia renewed its deadly attacks on Ukraine after a week-long pause that Trump had asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to observe as a fierce cold swept Ukraine.",

Dean Nyirenda was returning from a fishing trip with two friends on Wednesday when they bumped into the elephants. They ran away, with Nyirenda diving into a stream near the Luangwa River.\"That is when he was attacked by a crocodile by biting his right thigh,\" local police chief Robertson Mweemba told journalists. The southern African country has a thriving elephant population and clashes between humans and wildlife have claimed many lives in recent years.Police said Nyirenda had managed to escape the crocodile by hitting it with a stick which he had in his hands.\"He dragged himself from the stream,\" said MweembaHis two fellow fishermen, who had been watching from a distance, went to help him and carried him from the riverbank while he was bleeding heavily, state-run ZNBC news website reported.  \"They tried to stop the bleeding but unfortunately he died,\" added the police chief. Wildlife officers later visited the scene and found deep bite marks on the fisherman's right thigh, which had led to the fatal bleeding.The BBC has reached out to the authorities for comment.The Luangwa River, which flows through Zambia's South Luangwa National Park, is home to one of the highest concentrations of Nile crocodiles in Africa, according to conservationists. Of the 26 wildlife-related deaths recorded in 2023, 15 were caused by crocodile attacks, most of them along the Luangwa River, according to Resource Africa, a community-led conservation NGO.Zambian authorities have previously called on locals and tourists to exercise extreme caution when travelling through the country's wildlife hotspots.Wildlife authorities say they have been considering measures to reduce the human-animal conflicts, including building protective fences near wildlife areas.You may also be interested in: Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "9 hours agoKelly NgandShaimaa Khalil,Tokyo correspondentReutersTakaichi has \"already proven to be a strong, powerful, and wise leader,\" Trump says in throwing his weight behind herDonald Trump has endorsed Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi ahead of a snap election in her country on Sunday. Takaichi has \"already proven to be a strong, powerful, and wise leader... one that truly loves her country,\" the US president wrote in a Truth Social post on Thursday, adding: \"She will not let the people of Japan down!\"While it is rare for US presidents to publicly back candidates in foreign elections, Trump has done so before, endorsing Argentina's Javier Milei and Hungary's Viktor Orban most recently.  Takaichi has courted the US president as Tokyo seeks more stability in its relationship with Washington, its closest ally, in the wake of Trump's tariffs. Trump had threatened a 25% tariff initially, but Japan then struck a deal in July  to invest $550bn (£407bn) in the US. In exchange, Washington lowered import levies to 15%. Takaichi, 64, became PM in October after she won the leadership race in her party and secured enough support in parliament. But she called for an last month election to seek a public mandate. Just one week after she took office, Tokyo rolled out the red carpet for Trump, deploying a full military guard of honour and band to welcome him at the Akasaka Palace, the government's state guesthouse.It was her diplomatic debut, and the optics were striking: Takaichi aboard the aircraft carrier USS George Washington, fists pumping as the US president praised her in front of thousands of US soldiers, the images then broadcast around the world.She sought to portray herself as a leader Trump can and wants to do business with and, perhaps more importantly for the president, someone he gets along with personally.The two leaders also see eye-to-eye on defence. Trump wants Tokyo to spend more on its own security and so does Takaichi, as sentiment grows in Japan that it must invest more in defence. They heaped compliments on each other during the visit and signed a deal on rare earths, as well as a document heralding a new \"golden age\" of US-Japan relations. Takaichi described Trump as a \"partner in a new golden era\", and praised his role in bringing peace to the Middle East. \"In my visit to Japan, I and all of my representatives, were extremely impressed with her,\" Trump wrote in his Truth Social post on Thursday, noting that the two countries have made progress in national security cooperation and on the economic front.Trump also said he will welcome Takaichi to the White House on 19 March. Getty Images'My goal is to become the Iron Lady,' Takaichi saysHis post, which signals that Takaichi is a leader his administration would work with, is a message aimed not only at Japanese voters but also the region, and especially China. Beijing and Tokyo are in the middle of  a diplomatic rift, and the historically tense relationship has hit its lowest point in more than a decade.Takaichi found herself the target of China's ire in November, when she made comments suggesting that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan, the self-governed island it has long claimed. She has since refused to retract the statement.Trump's endorsement of her comes as tensions between them continue, and a day after he had a phone call with China's leader Xi Jinping. Xi called Taiwan \"the most important issue\" in their relationship, emphasising that Taiwan was \"China's territory\", Chinese state media reported. He also told Trump that Washington should be \"prudent\" when supplying weapons to the self-governed island which China has long claimed.Polls so far are predicting a landslide for Takaichi but winning Sunday's election will just be the first of several hurdles. Her leadership will be defined by how she manages Japan's stagnant economy and the delicate relationship with the US, its most critical security ally, as well as China, its largest trading partner.",

    "body": "4 hours agoKali HaysTechnology reporterReutersAmazon has announced plans to invest $200bn (£147.7bn) in artificial intelligence (AI) and infrastructure, becoming the latest US tech giant to set out a sharp rise in spending.It dwarfs the $125bn Amazon spent on AI last year, and appeared to rattle investors who sent the company's shares down more than 11% in after-hours trading.This week Big Tech's major players - Amazon, Meta, Google, and Microsoft - collectively announced they will this year plough $650bn into AI and related projects However, some high profile names in finance and technology have warned that AI is at risk of becoming a bubble which could burst.As Amazon, which was founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, set out its full-year results on Thursday, it said it will invest in \"AI, chips, robotics and low earth orbit satellites\". Amazon's chief executive, Andy Jassy, was clear on a call with financial analysts that the bulk of its spending will go towards AI. \"It's an unusual opportunity,\" Jassy said of AI, suggesting it will become profitable in the future.\"I passionately believe every customer experience we have today will be reinvented by AI. We're going to invest aggressively,\" Jassy added.However, investors are concerned about the scale of spending on AI and when companies will start to see a return. Like Amazon, the likes of Meta and Microsoft also saw their share prices fall this week.Mary Therese Barton, chief investment officer at Pictet Asset Management, told the BBC there were \"certainly jitters\".She said: \"It has definitely been a bit of a rupture and a bit of a wake up call as well, in terms of 'are these investments in AI going to come good?'.\"The boss of US tech giant Cisco told the BBC that the transition to AI will create winners, but warned there will be \"carnage along the way\". Chuck Robbins said the technology will be \"bigger than the internet\", but the current market is probably a bubble and some companies \"won't make it\".And Jamie Dimon, boss of one of America's biggest banks, JPMorgan Chase, said some of the money invested in AI would \"probably be lost\".Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, noted that the company was looking at cost reductions elsewhere as it ramps up spending.Leaders of other companies joining the AI rush have struck a similar tone.Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg said in January the company will spend up to $135bn this year, nearly double last year's amount.The Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp owner is working on training its AI models, building out data centres and buying the computer chips that are required to operate AI tools.But Zuckerberg also pointed to the use of AI by technical workers, saying that fewer people are now needed on big projects.He predicted \"2026 to be the year that AI dramatically changes the way we work.\"Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said his firm will invest even more than Meta on AI, more than doubling its capital expenditure to $185bn this year. The company is expanding its technical infrastructure related to AI, including servers and data centres.While Microsoft did not say exactly how much it will spend over the year, it has so far spent over $72bn on recruiting talent and infrastructure related to AI, while executives have made no mention of pulling back spending.The S&P 500 stock index fell by more than 1% on Thursday, adding to a week of losses from an all-time high reached at the end of January.",

    "body": "The World Anti-Doping Agency could investigate if evidence emerges that male ski jumpers are injecting their penises in a bid to improve sporting performance.In January, German newspaper Bild, external reported that jumpers were injecting their penises with hyaluronic acid before being measured for their suits.Hyaluronic acid, which is not banned in sport, can be used to increase penis circumference by one or two centimetres.This would increase the surface area of their suits during competition, which, according to FIS, the international ski and snowboard federation, could increase their flight in the air.\"Every extra centimetre on a suit counts. If your suit has a 5% bigger surface area, you fly further,\" said FIS ski jumping men's race director Sandro Pertile.Asked about the claims in Bild at a press conference at the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics, Wada director general Olivier Niggli said: \"I am not aware of the details of ski jumping, and how that could improve performance. \"If anything was to come to the surface, we would look at it and see if it is doping related. We don't address other [non-doping] means of enhancing performance.\"Clearly entertained by the question, Wada's Polish president Witold Banka joked: \"Ski jumping is very popular in Poland so I promise you I'm going to look at it.\"FIS communications director Bruno Sassi told BBC Sport: \"There has never been any indication, let alone evidence, that any competitor has ever made use of a hyaluronic acid injection to attempt to gain a competitive advantage.\"Before the start of each season, ski jumpers are measured using 3D body scanners, in which they must wear only \"elastic, body-tight underwear\". Rules state their suits must have a tolerance of only 2-4cm, and as part of the measuring process, their crotch height is also measured.The crotch height of their suit must conform to the athlete's crotch height, with the addition of 3cm for men.Hyularonic acid injected into the penis can last up to 18 months.There have been previous attempts to improve performance through manipulations of the suits.In August, Norwegian Olympic medallists Marius Lindvik and Johann Andre Forfang accepted three-month suspensions for their part in the tampering of suits during the men's large hill event at the World Ski Championships in Trondheim, Norway, in March.While it later transpired the athletes themselves were not aware of the tampering, FIS said their team had \"tried to cheat the system\" by putting reinforced thread in their jumpsuits.Both athletes are set to compete at these Winter Olympics, which officially start on Friday.The men's ski jumping competition begins on Monday.",

    "body": "5 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporterGetty ImagesPrior to the opening of the Canadian consulate, only Iceland and the United States had a full diplomatic presence in Greenland. Canada is set to open its first diplomatic outpost in Greenland in a significant show of solidarity following US President Donald Trump's threats to take control of the territory. A delegation of senior Canadian officials, including Governor General Mary Simon, and foreign minister Anita Anand, are travelling to Nuuk on Friday to formally open Canada's consulate, accompanied by a Canadian Coast Guard ship.Ahead of the trip, Simon said in a speech that Canada \"stands firmly in support of the people of Greenland who will determine their own future\".Their visit comes amid a similar trip made by French officials, who are due to open their own consulate in the territory the same day.The Canadian and French missions are a historic expansion of foreign engagement in Greenland. Until this week, only Iceland and the US had formal diplomatic consulates in Nuuk.It is also a signal of the continued support offered by Nato allies to Greenland, after Trump repeatedly stated that the US needs to \"own\" it for national security reasons. The president has since walked his comments back, saying he is now exploring a potential deal after talks with Denmark, European allies and Canada.Greenland has been on Canada's radar for some time. The consulate was first announced in early 2024, when Ottawa reviewed its Arctic foreign policy. The opening had been slated for late 2025, but that was delayed due to bad weather.Getty ImagesGovernor General Mary Simon (right) is part of the delegation travelling to Nuuk. She is Canada's Crown representative and head of state.Now, the consulate carries even more weight, said Michael Myers, a professor at the University of British Columbia who has authored several books on the Arctic.\"I'm only surprised it hasn't occurred sooner, given the important connections between Greenland and Arctic Canada,\" he added.He noted that Iqaluit, the capital of Canada's northern territory of Nunavut, is only an hour flight away from Nuuk. Inuit in Canada also share a strong bond with Greenlandic Inuit – a bond underscored by Governor General Simon's own Inuk roots.\"Her visit is an affirmation at the highest level of the cultural and ethnic connections between Arctic Canada and Greenland,\" Myers said. \"It's a very powerful statement.\"Simon, who grew up in Nunavik in northern Quebec, is the first Canadian governor general to visit Greenland since 1982. But her exposure to the Arctic territory began decades ago, she said, when she would hear Greenlandic Inuit songs as a child through her grandmother's shortwave radio.\"She would say: 'These are our relatives who live in faraway lands. We are all one people,'\" Simon recalled at the annual Arctic Frontiers conference this week in Norway, shortly before her trip to Nuuk.Natan Obed, president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, which represents Canadian Inuit, told the BBC that the consulate is the result of years of advocacy by his community to forge closer ties.Obed said that around 50 Canadian Inuit will be arriving on a chartered plane from Montreal to Nuuk to attend Friday's ceremony.Inuit in Canada, he said, feel the US threats against Greenland intimately due to their shared history of colonisation, as well as Trump's own comments about Canada.\"We do worry that the United States may return to its more serious overtures around annexing Canada and Canada being the 51st state, and we do worry that Inuit Nunangat, our homeland, is one of the pivotal reasons for the US to consider that sentiment,\" Obed said.Getty ImagesGreenlanders have strongly opposed Donald Trump's proposal of seizing the semi-autonomous Arctic island, as have other Nato allies like France and Canada.Trump has justified a US takeover of Greenland by blaming Denmark for failing to adequately protect the island from Russian or Chinese threats. The Arctic has been flagged as a vulnerability by successive Canadian governments, and Obed acknowledged that infrastructure there, like highways and electricity connections, remains limited, to the detriment of both national security and those who call the northern regions home.Prime Minister Mark Carney's government has promised a year-round military presence in the Arctic and pledged more than C$1bn ($730m; £540m) for northern infrastructure projects that would be used by both civilians and the military.Foreign minister Anand has called Arctic defence \"an unquestionable national security priority of this government\".\"It is not a secondary concern, it is not a regional issue, but central to how we protect Canada in our front yard and how we contribute to global security,\" she said at a Nordic-Canadian Arctic Symposium last week.Along with the opening of the Canadian consulate, Governor General Simon will also be meeting with Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, while Anand will meet with her counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt.",

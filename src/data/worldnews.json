    "body": "'The answer cannot be nothing': The battle over Canada's mystery brain disease16 hours agoJoel Gunter,senior international reporter, New BrunswickandNadine Yousif,senior Canada reporter, New BrunswickBBCFive hundred people in a small Canadian province were diagnosed with a mystery brain disease. What would it mean for the patients if the disease was never real?In early 2019, officials at a hospital in the small Canadian province of New Brunswick noticed that two patients had contracted an extremely rare brain condition known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, or CJD.CJD is both fatal and potentially contagious, so a group of experts was quickly assembled to investigate. Fortunately for New Brunswick, the disease didn't spread. But the story didn't end there. In fact, it was just beginning.Among the experts was Alier Marrero, a soft-spoken, Cuban-born neurologist who had been working in the province for about six years. Marrero would share some worrying information with the other members of the group. He had been seeing patients with unexplained CJD-like symptoms for several years, he said, including young people who showed signs of a rapidly progressing dementia. The number of cases was already more than 20, Marrero said, and several patients had already died.Because of the apparent similarity to CJD, Marrero had been reporting these cases to Canada's Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance System, or CJDSS. But the results had been coming back negative. Marrero was stumped.More worrying still, he was seeing a dizzying array of symptoms among the patients, according to his notes. There were cases of dementia, weight loss, unsteadiness, jerking movements and facial twitches. There were patients with spasms, visions, limb pain, muscle atrophy, dry skin and hair loss. Many said they were suffering with both insomnia and waking hallucinations. Patients reported excessive sweating and excessive drooling. Several exhibited Capgras Delusion, which causes someone to believe that a person close to them has been replaced by an identical-looking imposter. Others appeared to lose the ability to speak. One patient would report that she had forgotten how to write the letter Q.Marrero ordered test after test. But he was at a loss. \"I just kept seeing new patients, I kept documenting new cases, and I kept seeing new people dying,\" he recalled. \"And an image of a cluster became more clear.\"Many of the cluster patients believe industrial poisoning has affected New Brunswick's environment. (Chris Donovan/BBC)Over the coming months, Marrero and the CJDSS scientists began to suspect that instead of a small cluster of CJD patients, the province of New Brunswick might have on its hands a much larger cluster of people suffering from a completely unknown brain disease.Over the next five years, Marrero's cluster would balloon from 20 to an astonishing 500. But there came no scientific breakthrough, no new understanding of neurology, no expensive new treatments. Instead, last year, a bombshell research paper authored by several Canadian neurologists and neuroscientists concluded that there was in fact no mystery disease, and that the patients had all likely suffered from previously known neurological, medical, or psychiatric conditions. The New Brunswick cluster was, one of the paper's authors told the BBC, a \"house of cards\".To report this story, the BBC spent time with Marrero and spoke to a dozen of his patients or their relatives — some of whom are telling their story for the first time — as well as key scientists, experts, and government officials, and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal emails and documents obtained by freedom of information requests.We can reveal that at least one cluster patient has now opted for death via medical assistance in dying — legal in Canada since 2016. The diagnosis on the death certificate, according to the doctor who signed it off, was \"degenerative neurological condition of unknown cause\". At least one other cluster patient is currently considering assisted dying.The research paper published last year could have marked the end of a strange chapter in Canadian science. Except, hundreds of the patients disagree. Defiant, fiercely loyal to Marrero, and backed by passionate patient advocates, they argue that the paper is flawed and reject any notion that the cluster might not be real.Many believe instead that they have been poisoned by an industrial environmental toxin, and that the government of New Brunswick has conspired against them to cover it up.\"I'm not a conspiracy theorist type person, at all, but I honestly think it's financially motivated,\" said Jillian Lucas, one of the patients. \"There's all these different levels.\"Lucas first met Marrero back in early 2020, after her stepfather, Derek Cuthbertson, an accountant and military veteran, began experiencing cognitive and behavioural problems including sudden rage and loss of empathy. He was referred to Marrero, who ordered a battery of tests but was unable to explain his symptoms. Cuthbertson became one of the early cluster patients — the so-called \"original 48\".Lucas had just gone through a divorce and suffered a bad concussion, and she moved back in with her mother and Cuthbertson in their rural community near the city of Moncton. Soon she began experiencing her own symptoms and went to see Marrero for herself.\"He ran so many tests, so much blood work and scans and spinal taps,\" Lucas recalled. \"We were trying to rule absolutely everything out and we just kept coming up with more questions.\"Short on answers, Marrero added Lucas to the cluster. Over the coming months, her symptoms worsened and new symptoms appeared. She experienced light sensitivity, tremors, terrible migraines and issues with her memory and ability to speak clearly, she said. She felt unexplained stabbing pains. Cold water felt scalding hot.Jillian Lucas and her stepfather Derek Cuthbertson. Both were diagnosed by Marrero with the mystery illness. (Chris Donovan/BBC)Marrero, though, was attentive and caring. He took her symptoms seriously. \"He made me feel seen and that what I was experiencing was important,\" Lucas wrote in a Facebook post about her struggle.It was a sentiment that seemed to be shared by everyone who saw Marrero. He held their hands during appointments. He remembered them, cried with them. He was \"the only one listening to them,\" said Lori-Ann Roness, one of the cluster patients.\"He's an incredible human and physician,\" said Melissa Nicholson, whose mother died last year after being diagnosed with the mystery disease.\"Watching our mom go through it was hard enough,\" Nicholson said. \"But he was such a pillar of support.\"In March 2021, with Canada still in the grip of the Covid pandemic, the cluster suddenly became news. New Brunswick's chief medical officer had sent a memo to doctors alerting them to the apparent syndrome and suggesting they contact Marrero with possible cases. The memo leaked and the story hit the papers.Marrero found himself inundated with new patients. But he was also drawing support from the highest levels of Canadian science. The working group set up to respond to the original CJD cases had evolved into a multi-disciplinary group studying the cluster, and the possibility of a mysterious new neurological condition seemed, at times, irresistible to the scientists.\"It's like reading a movie script,\" emailed one researcher to colleagues, about an early story in the Toronto Star.\"We are all in the movie!\", a senior federal scientist replied.Dr Marrero at home in New Brunswick. \"I kept documenting new cases and I kept seeing new people dying,\" he said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)At the heart of the working group was Marrero, along with Dr Michael Coulthart, the head of the CJD Surveillance System; Dr Neil Cashman, a leading Canadian neurologist; Dr Michael Strong, the head of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); and Dr Samuel Weiss, one of the CIHR's senior neurologists. All agreed that Marrero needed considerable support. Strong said he could arrange additional staff and offered himself up as a consultant. The CIHR offered the province of New Brunswick C$5 million ($3.6m; £2.7m) to investigate.And the mystery disease got a name: the \"New Brunswick Neurological Syndrome of Unknown Cause\". In an email to Marrero in April 2021, Strong called it \"one of the most unusual constellations of findings I have ever seen\".\"We all owe you a debt of gratitude,\" he wrote.But not everyone was on board. Dr Gerard Jansen, a neuropathologist who was attached to the CJD Surveillance System, had noticed something unusual when referrals from Marrero's office started piling up. Jansen recalled feeling \"flabbergasted\" at Marrero's notes, which he said featured an array of broad and unrelated clinical observations — a \"diarrhea of symptoms\".Jansen saw clues in the patients' files that he said pointed to already defined neurological diseases. When he examined brain tissue samples of a few cluster patients who had died, he found signs of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia.He was alarmed. His superior, Coulthart, appeared to believe something unexplained was happening in New Brunswick, Jansen said. Keen to get his concerns down in writing, he sent Coulthart a long and detailed email.\"All available evidence and logic\" pointed to a collection of different diseases, Jansen wrote.\"The patients are real, but the clustering as a mystery disease is not.\"The early cases seemed to be grouped around two locations: Moncton and the Acadian Peninsula. Suspecting an environmental link, the scientists and officials considered various possible culprits, from a rare moose-borne parasite to blue-green algae blooms to Agent Orange sprayed on the province in the 1970s. Nothing bore fruit.Marrero said he had observed an uptick in cases in late summer and early autumn — forestry spraying season — and he zeroed in on a controversial herbicide called glyphosate. Chronic exposure to glyphosate, which is used extensively by New Brunswick's forestry industry, has been linked by some studies to neuroinflammation and Parkinson's disease. (Forest NB, an industry body, told the BBC that glyphosate was used in compliance with regulations and was \"not expected to pose risks\" to human health or the environment.)According to Marrero, many of his patients were showing highly elevated levels of both glyphosate and various heavy metals. Though when asked by the BBC what proportion of his 500 or so patients had concerning results, he refused to say. \"I don't want to provide exact numbers of anything, but let's say it's an unusual number. Beyond 100.\"By April 2021, the focus was firmly on a possible environmental toxin. Strong, the CIHR director, said he thought a full \"boots-on-the-ground\" investigation was needed. The same month, a specialist clinic — the Mind Clinic — was set up in New Brunswick with Marrero at the helm to treat the cluster patients. With the $5m on offer from the CIHR, and the backing of Strong and other top federal scientists, all the conditions appeared set to get to the bottom of the mystery.But then, everything changed. In May, New Brunswick effectively suspended the collaboration with the federal scientists. The province also decided not to take up the $5m on offer from the CIHR. According to Marrero, the decision killed off any prospect of finding an answer. \"Everybody received that email like a cold shower,\" he said.None of the provincial officials involved agreed to talk to the BBC on the record. But it is clear there was concern about Marrero's methods and about the nature of his contact with Coulthart, Strong and the other federal scientists. The view of some at senior levels of the New Brunswick government was that the informal working group, seduced by the possibility of a scientific mystery, was circumventing the province.But the decision to leave the money on the table, rather than spend it investigating, fuelled suspicions that New Brunswick wanted to avoid scrutiny of its environment. According to Kat Lanteigne, the executive director of Canadian health non-profit Bloodwatch and a tireless supporter of Marrero, the actions of the province amounted to a full-blown cover up.\"They pulled the plug because they just don't want anybody looking,\" Lanteigne said. \"Full stop.\"Taking control of the process, New Brunswick mounted two investigations into the original cluster of 48 — one telephone questionnaire and one study of the patients' medical records by an oversight committee of six provincial neurologists.Jansen, the neuropathologist who had raised concerns, had by that point examined the autopsies of eight cluster patients and firmly believed they all had known, diagnosable illnesses. Troubled, he passed his conclusions on to the oversight committee and presented them to the Canadian Association of Neuropathologists.Not long after that, the New Brunswick government finished its investigations, concluding in February 2022 that there was no common environmental cause and no common condition among the patients. In other words, no mystery disease.A protest sign in New Brunswick. Some residents are angry about pesticide use in the province. (Chris Donovan/BBC)But the government had decided against examining any of the patients in person, an omission that outraged those who believed they were part of the cluster. The patients — now 105 in number — were attending sporadic appointments with Marrero at the Mind Clinic but seeing little progress. Jillian Lucas's symptoms were worsening at such a rate that she had begun to weigh something once unthinkable to her: medically assisted dying.At the clinic, appointments with Marrero could be strangely conspiratorial, patients said. During one appointment, Lucas's stepmother Susan recalled, Marrero put his hand up, told them to stop talking, and went to the door to listen. \"He said, 'I believe we are being recorded'.\"Stacie Quigley-Cormier, whose stepdaughter Gabrielle was the youngest member of the cluster, said Marrero always spoke in a hushed tone.\"The experience with Dr Marrero — and other patients talk about this too — is you make sure you start talking after the door is closed, and there's a quiet tone to his voice, and you make sure you're not talking in the hallways and things like that.\"Marrero declined to discuss it. \"Some patients actually thought that way. And I… We wondered… But I don't want to comment.\"In August 2022, Marrero was sacked from the Mind Clinic. \"Despite our repeated attempts to inform you of our expectations and the deficiencies in your performance, you have not demonstrated a sustained ability to meet our expectations,\" wrote John Dornan, then-CEO of the health network. The 105 cluster patients each received their own letter, telling them they could stay at the clinic, with all the resources it had to offer, or strike out alone with Marrero.Many were offended on behalf of their neurologist. \"When they called me to ask my choice, I said, it's not a choice, it's an ultimatum,\" Lucas said. \"And I choose him.\"Jillian Lucas at home with one of the family's 15 parrots. (Chris Donovan/BBC)She wasn't alone. Of the 105 patients, 94 chose Marrero. Just 11 people decided to stay with the clinic and get a second opinion.Outside of the clinic, increasingly isolated, Marrero continued to diagnose the mystery disease. He was sending patients for so many tests, for such obscure toxins or conditions, that some reported being met with an increasingly quizzical eye at the testing clinic, as if to say, \"What now?\"Others found it difficult to get an appointment with Marrero or even speak to his assistant.\"I've messaged a couple of times but they're so busy, you can't even hardly get a hold of them by email,\" said Lucas. \"He just has so many patients.\"As the cluster generated more news coverage in Canada, little attention was paid to the 11 patients who had decided to stay with the Mind Clinic, and their stories have never been told.Kevin Strickland's partner April was referred to Marrero after she stopped her car in the middle of the road one morning and apparently forgot how to drive. April, then 60, had already been showing some dementia-like symptoms, but the driving incident scared Strickland. Marrero ran a series of tests on April and diagnosed the mystery illness.\"He told me it was the mystery illness and he wanted to look further into it, but he never really did much after that,\" Strickland said.Kevin Strickland at home with his rescue dog. His partner April was diagnosed by Marrero with the mystery illness. (Chris Donovan/BBC)The couple waited eight months to get important test results from Marrero, Strickland said, as April's condition worsened. Soon Strickland could no longer manage her care. But to get her a place in assisted living he needed a letter of support from Marrero. \"I think I waited four months for that letter,\" Strickland recalled. \"I kept phoning and asking.\"Eventually he gave up and turned to the Mind Clinic, he said, and got the letter. And the Mind Clinic neurologists gave April something else she needed — a firm diagnosis. She was suffering from a form of frontotemporal dementia. In the end, Marrero \"did nothing for April,\" Strickland said. \"I guess he was more interested in proving the mystery illness than he was helping his patients,\" he said.Sandi Partridge also chose to remain with the Mind Clinic. She felt a deep sense of loyalty to Marrero, but she also saw simple common sense in getting a second opinion.Partridge had first seen Marrero in 2020, after suffering headaches and balance issues. He ordered a barrage of tests — according to Partridge she had two MRIs, two EEGs, a SPECT, a CAT scan and a spinal tap, as well as more than a dozen different antibody tests. \"It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero,\" she recalled. \"Every time he would see me, it would be an hour and a half, sometimes two hours, and he would retest me every single time.\"But every test came back negative. Partridge had also provided Marrero with a video of her having a seizure at home, which he studied. He diagnosed her with the mystery illness. \"Those were the words he used,\" she said.Sandi Partridge in a park near her home. \"It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)One thing Marrero never mentioned to Partridge was functional neurological disorder, which was her eventual diagnosis. FND is a complex condition; previously known as psychosomatic or psychogenic illness, it describes physical symptoms that can have a psychological root - sometimes described as being an issue with the brain's 'software' rather than any structural damage. It presents a challenge to doctors, who have to guide patients through the stigma associated with it to an understanding that they have a real condition that requires complex treatment.Partridge's neurologists at the Mind Clinic also reviewed the seizure video she had shown to Marrero, and observed her having a seizure at the clinic. \"As soon as Dr Abdellah saw my seizure he said, that's FND,\" Partridge recalled. (Abdellah declined to speak to the BBC). Partridge threw herself into researching the condition. \"And I thought, that's me, that's me, that's me, that's me,\" she said. \"I hit every single marker.\"Partridge is now on a multi-faceted FND treatment programme involving neurology, neuropsychology and occupational health. And she is at peace with her diagnosis. \"The stigma is difficult,\" she said, \"but I've accepted it.\"Gabrielle Cormier, the youngest patient in Marrero's cluster, would also receive a diagnosis of FND, but her journey would follow a different path.Cormier has featured heavily in the media coverage of the cluster, becoming a kind of poster child for the mystery disease. She was first referred to Marrero at just 18. A high school student, dancer and competitive figure skater, she had begun to experience fatigue-like symptoms and muscle soreness and then passed out at school.Cormier was already taking anti-anxiety medication, and the hospital emergency room doctor told her the incident was anxiety-induced. Unhappy with his assessment (he told Cormier, who is gay, that she \"just needed to find a boyfriend\", she said), the family looked to Marrero for answers.Gabrielle Cormier was diagnosed by Marrero at just 18. \"I've done nothing with my life since I got sick,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)Marrero was different — empathetic, caring. As he had with other patients, he ran Cormier through a gauntlet of tests. When nothing showed up, he diagnosed her with the mystery illness. Canada was deep in the isolation of the Covid lockdown, but Marrero reassured them.\"He said, there's a dozen other people at least that are experiencing similar things to what you're experiencing, and I don't have answers for it yet,\" stepmother Stacie Quigley-Cormier recalled. \"He told her that she wasn't alone.\"There was one test Marrero couldn't secure: a PET scan, because the hard-up province was largely reserving them for cancer patients. So Cormier's parents took her to Toronto for the scan and a second opinion by a leading neurologist there, Dr Anthony Lang.After a multi-day evaluation at a specialist neurology centre, Lang diagnosed Cormier with FND. Her tests showed that conscious movements were weak but forced reflex or automotive movements were normal and healthy. It pointed to psychology.The Quigley-Cormiers were initially prepared to accept the FND diagnosis, they said. But they left Toronto unhappy after Lang told them to stop treating Cormier as though she had a terminal illness because it was reinforcing her condition.A few weeks later, Lang called Cormier to inform her that a delayed test result had shown some reduced blood flow in her brain — something Marrero had also observed — and which can be caused by various medical or psychological issues including depression. Lang told Cormier the abnormality was slight and bore no relation to her symptoms, so she shouldn't worry about it.The call didn't sit well with the Quigley-Cormiers.\"There was no reason to call her personal phone when he knew she had memory problems,\" said her father Andre, angrily.Global NewsGabrielle Cormier, in her wheelchair, with other patients calling for suppport. Jillian Lucas is far left. (Global News)The call pushed the Quigley-Cormier family away from Lang and his FND diagnosis and back towards Marrero, who the family had come to believe in deeply. Marrero had never crossed \"any kind of line,\" Stacie said. \"He's pristine.\"\"That's why all his patients like him,\" Andre said. \"Love him, maybe.\"Marrero continued to test Cormier repeatedly. He prescribed anti-seizure medication to prevent possible seizures, though she had not had any. He referred her for a round of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment — which she said caused severe headaches, aches, nausea, dizziness and aseptic meningitis — and prescribed a powerful intravenous immunosuppressant used for blood cancers and autoimmune illnesses. Neither improved her condition.Cormier once dreamed of studying pathology. But her illness caused her to drop out of university and for years she has gone everywhere either in a wheelchair or with a cane, living, for a 24-year-old, a restricted life.\"I've had this idea that my life has been wasted, or that I've done nothing with my life since I got sick,\" she said.\"So, yeah, it kind of feels like I've been robbed of that.\"Lang, the Toronto neurologist, came away from his interaction with the Quigley-Cormier family troubled. His call to Cormier was not only appropriate, he said, he was ethically bound to communicate with her directly because she was a mentally competent adult who did not ask for her parents to act for her.Over the coming months, Lang watched with concern as the purported cluster ballooned in New Brunswick. He emailed Marrero and left messages with his secretary offering help, but never heard back. In late 2023, frustrated by what he saw as cluster misinformation everywhere, Lang decided with colleagues to mount a study. The results — published in May 2025 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA — landed in New Brunswick like a hand grenade.Lang and his co-authors — including several former Mind Clinic colleagues of Marrero and the concerned neuropathologist, Gerard Jansen — found that all 25 patients in their study had suffered from previously known conditions, from functional neurological disorder to dementia to cancer. The probability of there being no new disease was close to 100%, they said. The real cause of the cluster, they concluded, was serial misdiagnosis by Marrero, compounded by credulous media reporting, the limitations of New Brunswick's public health system, institutional distrust sown by the pandemic and the actions of a small group of people \"co-opting the crisis to suit their agenda\".Dr Lang was the leading author on a paper casting doubt on the cluster. (Sammy Kogan/BBC)The cases in the JAMA paper consisted of 14 live patients and 11 autopsies. Most of the live patients were people who had chosen to remain at the Mind Clinic, like Sandi Partridge. A few, including Gabrielle Cormier, were included via a consent waiver — a legal process which allows researchers to use patient data without their express consent provided certain anonymity criteria are met.The study's conclusions incensed the most vocal patients and patient advocates, including Kat Lanteigne and Stacie Quigley-Cormier, who allege that the research was unscientific and unethical. The Quigley-Cormiers are furious that Gabrielle's data was used for the study, and their lawyers have sent letters to Lang and to the journal alleging the paper was a violation of her privacy. JAMA declined to comment on the dispute. Lang said that the research was legal, ethical and appropriately anonymised. As for the alleged violation of privacy, he pointed out that the only reason anyone knew Cormier's data was used was because her father and stepmother had told the media, along with many other details about her life.On a bright morning this past September, Marrero was sitting in his home office in a large cottage-style house on a plot of land just outside of Moncton. A stone fountain burbled softly in his Japanese-inspired peace garden. Birds sang in his own patch of forest — untouched by herbicides or pesticides, he said.Marrero is undeniably charismatic. He has a warm smile and demeanour. He speaks gently, but with authority. He remembers small details about people he barely knows and asks about their wellbeing in a manner that conveys genuine care.Settled in his office chair, he recalled with obvious pleasure that not so long ago, some of Canada's top scientists had sat with him around that very desk, ready to take on a scientific mystery. But now, Marrero seemed increasingly isolated.\"They are trying to present me as it,\" he said, dejectedly. \"I was part of it, but I was not it. The only difference is, when the table was empty, I stayed.\"Of Marrero's early federal collaborators — Drs Coulthart, Cashman, Strong, and Weiss — only Coulthart agreed to speak to the BBC about the cluster. He denied ever having been convinced by the idea of a unified, mystery syndrome. \"As a scientist, I use the word convinced very, very sparingly,\" he said. \"But don't let anybody kid you — if anyone says they know what's going on or isn't going on in New Brunswick, they're either lying or grossly mistaken. Because nobody has the facts.\"Dr Marrero in his home office. \"I was part of it, but I was not it,\" he said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)An upcoming provincial report could offer some answers. Unlike the previous studies, it will examine the claims of elevated glyphosate and heavy metals in the patients. At times, the stakes seem impossibly high. \"Lives hang in the balance,\" read a recent letter to Premier Susan Holt, signed by 72 of the patients. \"It is within your power to honour them, cherish them, and care for them,\" the letter said. \"Or you can abandon them and let them wither, fade, and ultimately die. Please join us on the right side of history.\"The patient advocates, led by Bloodwatch director Kat Lanteigne, have arguably done more than anyone to keep the story of the cluster going, with an operation that includes lobbying the government, briefing the press and sending legal letters to scientists.Lanteigne has publicly attacked both Jansen and Lang over the JAMA study, branding their work inaccurate and unethical. She denied harassing Jansen, saying she had never spoken to him directly and emailed him only once. \"I have a record of speaking truth to power and I have always worked with integrity and honesty,\" she said.Both Lang and Jansen are standing their ground.\"What we have here is a case of misdiagnosis, evolving to misinformation, and sadly resulting in suffering for patients and families,\" Lang said.\"I would even go further,\" Jansen said, regarding the alleged misdiagnosis of the patients. \"I would say they are being abused.\"Few others are willing to criticise Marrero so openly. Privately, former senior government officials and colleagues of Marrero have questioned whether he should have been investigated. The Royal College of Physicians told the BBC it could not comment on whether there had been complaints against any individual physician, and none have been made public in relation to Marrero. Any sanction process would typically begin with a complaint.And that was the issue, one former senior health official said.\"It has to be a patient complaint,\" they said. \"And all his patients love him.\"The last time Jillian Lucas saw Marrero was more than a year ago. He tested her again, but she is yet to see the results. During the appointment, he told her that just getting a common cold could kill her, she said. So she rarely leaves the house — a cramped and densely cluttered property that the family shares with 15 parrots. \"She spends 90% of her time in her bedroom,\" her stepmother said. \"It's a very limited life.\"Kat Lanteigne told the BBC that Marrero \"deserves the Order of Canada for what he has done for these people.\" But many patients, like Lucas, are languishing. Largely untreated, they have undergone test after test in search of the mystery disease and ended up back where they began, or somewhere worse.In response to criticisms in this story, Marrero said that he would not comment on patients or fellow physicians. \"The focus must remain on the hundreds of suffering patients, their families and communities who need to be the heart of our attention and care,\" he said.Jillian Lucas in her back garden. \"I don't want to be in a nursing home, or be a burden,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)Jillian Lucas has now seen a second doctor, but only because she has pushed ahead with her decision to explore medical assistance in dying, which requires two physicians to sign off. Canada has among the world's most permissive laws for assisted dying, allowing people to pursue it without a terminal diagnosis.When Lucas told Marrero her plan, he became \"choked up\", she said. \"It eats him up, he's fighting back tears.\"And yet, Marrero agreed to support her application, despite her not having a concrete diagnosis or testing positive for any known condition. (Marrero told the BBC he \"took the utmost care to abide by\" the laws around Maid and had \"never proposed it\" to a patient.) After all the years of uncertainty with the unknown neurological syndrome, the option of dying gave Lucas some sense of control. \"I have a limit in my mind of how far I can go,\" she said.Sitting in his garden office, the sun streaming in, Marrero had no such limits in mind. \"I keep going because I know,\" he said, confidently. He had been able to meet \"with some of the best scientists in the country,\" he said. He had more than 500 cluster patients now, and every week the number was going up.",

Conditions for emergency services working at the site were challenging, the mayor added, with unstable debris posing a hazard and crew waiting for better equipment to arrive.The privately-owned Binaliw landfill collapsed on Thursday while 110 workers were on site, officials said.Archival said in a Facebook post on Saturday morning: \"Authorities confirmed the presence of detected signs of life in specific areas, requiring continued careful excavation and the deployment of a more advanced 50-ton crane.\"Relatives of those missing have been waiting anxiously for any news of their whereabouts. More than 30 people, all workers at the landfill, are thought to be missing.\"We are just hoping that we can get someone alive... We are racing against time, that's why our deployment is 24/7,\" Cebu City councillor Dave Tumulak, chairman of the city's disaster council, told news agency AFP.AFP via Getty ImagesRelatives of the missing are waiting anxiously for any news of their loved onesJerahmey Espinoza, whose husband is missing, told news agency Reuters at the site on Saturday: \"They haven't seen him or located him ever since the disaster happened. We're still hopeful that he's alive.\"The cause of the collapse remains unclear, but Cebu City councillor Joel Garganera previously said it was likely the result of poor waste management practices.Operators had been cutting into the mountain, digging the soil out and then piling garbage to form another mountain of waste, Garganera told local newspaper The Freeman on Friday.The Binaliw landfill covers an area of about 15 hectares (37 acres).Landfills are common in major Philippine cities like Cebu, which is the trading centre and transportation gateway of the Visayas, the archipelago nation's central islands.",

    "body": "3 hours agoGabriela PomeroyandUsman Zahid,in IslamabadA newly married couple were killed when a gas cylinder exploded at a house in Islamabad where they were sleeping after their wedding party, police have said. A further six people - including wedding guests and family members - who were staying there also died in the blast. More than a dozen people were injured. The explosion took place at 07:00 local time (02:00 GMT) on Sunday, causing the roof to collapse. Parts of the walls were blown away, leaving piles of bricks, large concrete slabs and furniture strewn across the floor. Injured people were trapped under the rubble and had to be carried out on stretchers by rescue workers. Emergency workers said the blast happened due to gas leakage, which filled the room and then exploded. Three neighbouring houses were also damaged.  The chairman of Pakistan's Senate, Yusuf Raza Gilani, called it \"a heart-wrenching incident that turned celebrations into mourning\".Hanif Masih, the father of the groom, said his son had been married the previous day, and the newlywed couple, along with family members and guests, were sleeping in the house at the time of the explosion. Masih said everyone went to bed around 03:00 local time on Sunday (22:00 GMT on Saturday), and woke up to the devastation.Along with his son, his daughter-in-law, wife and sister-in-law were all killed.Police said they had cordoned off the area and were investigating the circumstances of the blast. Forensic officers in white suits were sent to comb through the debris. Deputy police commissioner Sahibzada Yousaf told local media that sniffer dogs and advanced technology were used to ensure everyone was rescued from the rubble.Many Pakistani households use liquefied petroleum gas cylinders for fuel and cooking. Gas cyclinders have been linked to other deadly accidents caused by gas leaks. Gilani expressed concern about the explosion and said more needed to be done to curb the \"unsafe use of gas cylinders\". \"Such incidents demand that relevant departments fulfil their responsibilities seriously and ensure safety measures,\" he said in a statement reported by local media.",

    "body": "2 hours agoGabriela PomeroyEPAOne person has died and 300 properties have been destroyed in bushfires that have torn across south-east Australia. The fires have raged in dozens of locations across the country for several days, mostly in the state of Victoria, but also in New South Wales, burning through land almost twice the size of Greater London.A state of emergency has been declared in Victoria as thousands of firefighters and more than 70 aircraft battle the blaze. Residents in more than a dozen communities have been advised to leave their homes.Authorities fear the fires, which are being fuelled by very hot, dry and windy conditions, could burn for several weeks.AAP/Michael Currie via REUTERSA forest burns in Longwood, Victoria, Australia on 9 January Victoria's Premier Jacinta Allan said 30 active fires were burning across the state, 10 of which were of particular concern. She said 350,000 hectares had been burnt across the state as of 08:00 local time on Sunday (23:00 GMT on Saturday). \"We will see fires continue for some time across the state and that is why we are not through the worst of this by a long way,\" she told Australian media. \"There are fires that are continuing right now that are threatening homes and property.\"Human remains were found in the village of Gobur, near the town of Longwood, some 110km (70 sq miles) north of the state capital Melbourne, police said. The victim has not yet been identified.Allan praised the emergency workers who worked to retrieve the body. \"This is difficult and confronting work, and it takes a heavy toll.\"\"The Gobur community is grieving,\" she said. Bushfire smoke is impacting air quality in many areas across Victoria, including metropolitan Melbourne. Authorities said the fires were the worst to hit the south-east of Australia since the 2019-2020 blazes that destroyed an area the size of Turkey and killed 33 people.ReutersFirefighter Tyrone Rice said losing his own home in the fire in Harcourt was \"a kick in the guts\"One of the worst-affected places is the small town of Harcourt in the central highlands of Victoria, where firefighter Tyrone Rice lost his own home in the blaze. He was out fighting one of the bushfires when he learned it was on fire. He told Australian media it was \"like a kick in the guts, but I'm not the first person to go through it, and I won't be the last\".The destruction in Harcourt was \"gut-wrenching\", local fire captain Andrew Wilson said. A reporter for Australia's 9 News, Jack Ward, told the BBC World Service he had visited the damage in several towns across Western Australia. What he saw was \"catastrophic\", he said, and in many places, \"all that's left of these houses is a tin roof lying on the ground\".While it is hard to link individual wildfires to climate change as how humans manage the land can play a factor, scientists say climate change is making the hot, dry weather conditions conducive to bush fires more common.",

In return, Cuba provided 'Security Services' for the last two Venezuelan dictators, BUT NOT ANYMORE!\" he posted on Truth Social on Sunday.\"THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO! I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.\"Trump did not specify the terms of a deal or the consequences Cuba could face.He also referenced the raid to seize Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who are facing drug trafficking and other charges in a US court.Cuba has for years supplied Maduro with his personal security detail. The Cuban government said 32 of its nationals were killed during the US operation in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas.Trump said: \"Most of those Cubans are DEAD from last week's USA attack, and Venezuela doesn't need protection anymore from the thugs and extortionists who held them hostage for so many years.\"\"Venezuela now has the United States of America, the most powerful military in the World (by far!), to protect them, and protect them we will.\"The Cuban government is yet to respond to Trump's latest threats, but President Miguel Díaz-Canel previously said the 32 \"brave Cuban combatants\" who died in Venezuela would be honoured for \"taking on the terrorists in imperial uniforms\".While the Trump administration has not stated clear plans for Cuba, the US president has previously said that a military intervention was unnecessary because the country was \"ready to fall\".US Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated last week that Cuba's leaders should be worried, saying that he would be \"concerned\" if he was in the Cuban government and that \"they're in a lot of trouble\".On Sunday, Trump also re-posted on social media a message suggesting that Rubio - a Cuban-American former Florida senator and the son of Cuban exiles - could become president of Cuba.Trump shared that post with the comment: \"Sounds good to me!\"The Trump administration's tactic of confiscating sanctioned Venezuelan oil tankers has already begun to worsen a fuel and electricity crisis in Cuba.",

    "body": "The US and its partner forces have carried out large-scale strikes against Islamic State (IS) group targets in Syria, the US Central Command (Centcom) has announced. US President Donald Trump directed the strikes on Saturday, which are part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, in retaliation to IS's deadly attack on US forces in Syria on 13 December, Centcom wrote on X.The strikes were conducted in an effort to combat terrorism and protect US and partner forces in the region, according to Centcom. \"Our message remains strong: if you harm our warfighters, we will find you and kill you anywhere in the world, no matter how hard you try to evade justice,\" Centcom said. The US and its partner forces fired more than 90 precision munitions at more than 35 targets in an operation that involved more than 20 aircraft, an official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.The official added that aircraft including F-15Es, A-10s, AC-130Js, MQ-9s and Jordanian F-16s had taken part in the strikes. The location of the strikes and the extent of any casualties is not yet clear.\"We will never forget, and never relent,\" Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X on Saturday in reference to the military action.  The Trump administration first announced the Operation Hawkeye Strike in December after an IS gunman killed two US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter in an ambush in Palmyra, located in the centre of Syria.\"This is not the beginning of a war - it is a declaration of vengeance,\" Hegseth said when announcing the operation in December. \"The United States of America, under President Trump's leadership, will never hesitate and never relent to defend our people.\"Prior to the latest strikes on Saturday, US forces killed or captured nearly 25 IS group members in 11 missions between 20 December and 29 December as part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, Centcom said. In the operation's first mission on 19 December, US and Jordanian forces carried out a \"massive strike\" against the IS group, deploying fighter jets, attack helicopters and artillery to strike \"more than 70 targets at multiple locations across central Syria\", according to Centcom. That operation, it said, \"employed more than 100 precision munitions\" targeting known IS infrastructure and weapons sites.Syria has been in a fragile state since the fall of President Bashar al-Assad's regime in December 2024, which effectively ended a civil war that had ravaged the country for 13 years. Ahmed al-Sharaa, also known by his nom-de-guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, has been serving as the country's president since his rebel group ousted Assad and solidified control.  The IS has been weakened in Syria, but still remains active, predominantly carrying out attacks against Kurdish-led forces in the north-east in 2025.",

    "body": "13 hours agoChristal HayesBBC News, Los AngelesBob Weir, the guitarist who co-founded the Grateful Dead, has died aged 78.Weir, a cornerstone of the California psychedelic rock group and many of its offshoots, passed away after a battle with cancer and lung issues, according to a post on his Instagram.\"There is no final curtain here, not really. Only the sense of someone setting off again,\" the post says, noting his hopes that his legacy and lengthy catalogue will live on.The post says he \"transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones\".\"He often spoke of a three-hundred-year legacy, determined to ensure the songbook would endure long after him,\" the post continues. \"May that dream live on through future generations of Dead Heads.\"With a career spanning more than 60 years, Weir's big break was in 1965 with the founding of the Grateful Dead. Within a few years, they became a force within San Francisco's characteristic counterculture.Quickly their style began shaping rock music - blending psychedelia and 1960s drug culture with musical tones that fused folk and Americana. They are considered one of the pioneers of jam bands.The group was inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and received a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Grammy's in 2007.'A large amount of weirdness': The long, strange success of the Grateful DeadThe group officially halted in 1995 with the death of fellow co-founder Jerry Garcia.But Weir was involved in various spin-offs, including Dead & Company, which had a residency at the Las Vegas Sphere in 2024 and 2025.Weir was diagnosed with cancer in July and even while being treated, he continued to perform, according to the post on his page.\"Those performances, emotional, soulful, and full of light, were not farewells, but gifts,\" the post says. \"Another act of resilience. An artist choosing, even then, to keep going by his own design.\"He beat cancer before his death, the posts adds. It's unclear what type of cancer he had been diagnosed with.His family, including wife Natascha and children Shala and Chloe, asked for privacy but said they appreciated the \"outpouring of love, support, and remembrance\".Tributes started to pour in late on Saturday from fellow musicians. Even the Empire State Building in New York City honoured the rock legend by shining with tie-dye colours to memorise him.Slash, guitarist of Guns N' Roses, posted a photo of Weir playing on stage. He wrote \"RIP\" with a broken-heart emoji.Former Eagles guitarist Don Felder posted a lengthy tribute.\"I first saw Bob at Woodstock with the Grateful Dead and was blown away by that whole band, and the musicianship,\" Felder posted on Instagram with a photo of himself with Weir.\"I feel so blessed to have been able to have him sing on 'Rock You' from American Rock and Roll. Until we meet again, amigo.\"His former publicist, Dennis McNally, spoke with BBC News about his music and the fun memories they shared.\"He had a very off-kilter, unusual sense of humour that was dry and funny,\" he said. \"The road was his life, and music was his life.\"He said playing and serving the music was what \"he was put on Earth for and he did it to the end\".",

    "body": "The final Kurdish fighters have withdrawn from the Syrian city of Aleppo, after the announcement of a ceasefire deal in the early hours of Sunday morning. Mazloum Abdi, leader of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), said an agreement had been made via international mediation, securing the safe evacuation of \"martyrs, the wounded, the trapped civilians and the fighters\" from the city. Buses carrying the last Kurdish-led SDF members were seen leaving the Kurdish majority neighbourhood of Sheikh Maqsoud, according to local media reports. The latest clashes in Aleppo started earlier this week, after negotiations to integrate the Kurds into Syria's new government reached a stalemate.At least 12 people were killed in the latest outbreak of violence, which also saw tens of thousands of civilians displaced after they were forced to flee Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh.The Syrian army shelled the area on Wednesday afternoon after designating the neighbourhoods \"closed military areas\", in response to what it alleged were attacks by armed groups in the area. The Kurdish-led SDF - which insists it has no military presence in Aleppo - called it a \"criminal attempt\" to forcibly displace residents.A ceasefire was raised earlier in the week, but Kurdish forces refused to leave the last stronghold of Sheikh Maksoud under the deal.In March 2025, the Kurdish-led SDF, which controls much of Syria's north-east and has tens of thousands of fighters, signed a deal to integrate all military and civilian institutions into the Syrian state. Both sides accusing each other of trying to derail the negotiations that followed, with the agreement still not realised almost a year later. The newest iteration of the ceasefire agreement was mediated by the US and other world powers, following concern that the stand-off in Aleppo risked Turkey's involvement. Turkey backs the Syrian government and considers the Kurdish militia that dominates the SDF a terrorist organisation.In a post to X on Saturday, the US ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, said he had met the Syrian president and urged all parties to \"exercise maximum restraint, immediately cease hostilities, and return to dialogue\" in accordance with the March agreement. He added that the US has welcomed Syria's \"historic transition\", and would extend  its support to President Ahmed al-Sharaa as he \"works to stabilize the country\".",

    "body": "A mountain of rubbish collapsed at a landfill in the central Philippines on Thursday, killing a 22-year-old woman and leaving more than 30 people missing, authorities have said.Rescuers pulled 12 injured sanitation workers from debris at the Binaliw Landfill in Cebu City, who were later hospitalised.Many of the missing are believed to be workers at the landfill. The mayor of Cebu told news outlet ABS-CBN that it may be difficult to reach survivors because of the potential for further collapse. The cause of the collapse is still unclear, but Cebu City councillor Joel Garganera said it was likely the result of poor waste management practices. Some 300 people from various government agencies and civilian groups have been deployed to the privately-owned landfill. Several excavators, ambulances and fire trucks have also been seen on site.\"All response teams remain fully engaged in search and retrieval efforts to locate the remaining missing persons,\" Cebu Mayor Nestor Archival said in a Facebook post on Friday.\"This is not like other landslides that you can just excavate. If you pull from the top, the bottom is soft. Let's say there is a person there, when you get the debris, it might get worse,\" he said, ABS-CBN reported.Cebu City councillor Joel Garganera said the incident may have happened suddenly, but was likely a result of poor waste management practices.Operators had been cutting into the mountain, mining the soil, and then piling garbage to form another mountain of waste, Garganera told local newspaper The Freeman.\"It's not a sanitary landfill. It's already an open dumpsite,\" he said.Families are waiting for updates on their loved ones trapped in the debris.One Binaliw resident, Belen Antigua, told Rappler that her son had survived the landslide but she was still waiting for her other relatives to be found. Another said that families had been gathered at the landfill to look for their children since Friday morning.\"I could not understand my emotions. They said those trapped are calling for help, so there is a possibility that my brother is still there,\" Michelle Lumapas, whose brother works at the landfill, told ABS-CBN.The Binaliw landfill is about 15 hectares (37 acres).Landfills are common in major Philippine cities like Cebu, which is the trading centre and transportation gateway of the Visayas, the archipelago nation's central islands.",

    "body": "2 days agoLucy HookerandRachel Clun,business reportersThe EU has reached a free trade agreement with South American countries, 25 years after talks began and despite opposition from farmers in several European countries.The deal with the Mercosur trading bloc - which includes Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay - will require the approval of the European parliament within the next few monthsBrazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva hailed it as a \"historic day for multilateralism\" after the four South American countries put the final touches to the deal in Brussels.It comes against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump's tariffs on countries around the world and his recent military intervention in Venezuela.The EU heralded what will be its largest free trade accord to date as a \"win-win\", although critics have argued that cheap imports may undercut European farmers in products including beef, poultry and sugar. \"In an international scenario of growing protectionism and unilateralism, the agreement is a signal in favour of international trade as a driver of economic growth, with benefits for both blocs,\" President Lula posted on X.EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the deal will \"bring meaningful benefits to consumers and businesses, on both sides\".Farmers in several countries in Europe held last-ditch protests against the deal, with marches and demonstrations using tractors in France and Belgium.\"There is a lot of pain,\" Judy Peeters, a representative for a Belgian young farmers' group, told AFP at a protest on a motorway south of Brussels. \"There is a lot of anger.\"Von der Leyen said the Commission had listened to the concerns of farmers, and had acted on them including through introducing \"robust safeguards\" to protect their livelihoods in the agreement.As well as boosting trade and political ties, the European Commission said the deal would help fight climate change, through commitments to halt deforestation and ensure a \"reliable\" flow of raw materials, critical for the global green transition.The Commission expects the deal to save local companies €4bn ($4.7bn, £3.5bn) a year in export duties.South American countries boast deposits of gold, copper and some of the critical minerals required for renewable and battery technology.Cecilia Malmström, a former European commissioner for trade who led EU trade negotiations for five years, told World Business Express on BBC World Service that parts of the trade agreement could be suspended if Mercosur countries failed to stick to their commitments around environmental protection.\"[This agreement] is also a very strong geopolitical signal today to other powers who do not appreciate rule-based trade in the same way as we do,\" she said.On Friday afternoon a broad majority of EU member states confirmed their support for the free trade agreement, but it will still require approval from the European Parliament before it can take effect.Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief Euro-zone economist for Capital Economics, said voting was expected to be close in the parliament.However, he said the larger issue was how much of an impact the deal would have, and pointed to the Commission's own estimate that it would raise EU economic output by just 0.05%.\"The bigger point though is that even if the agreement is eventually implemented, it will be macroeconomically insignificant,\" he said.\"And because it will be phased in over 15 years, these benefits won't arrive until 2040 at the earliest.\"",

    "body": "A rare copy of the 1938 comic that introduced Superman to the world has sold to an anonymous collector for $15m (£11.2m).The private sale of the Action Comics No 1 copy - once stolen from actor Nicolas Cage's home and returned to him over a decade later - was announced on Friday.The previous record for the sale of a comic book was set in November, when a pristine Superman No 1 fetched $9.12m at auction. Both sales far exceed the original 10-cent price tags - or around $2.25 in today's money.Superman's debut is one of several tales anthologised in Action Comics No 1, which is widely credited with having defined the superhero genre as we now know it. Fewer than 100 copies are thought to exist.Friday's Action Comics sale was negotiated by New York-based Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect, which said both the comic book's owner and the buyer wished to remain anonymous.The broker said the copy had been graded nine out of a possible 10 points by the Certified Guaranty Company, which specialises in authenticating collectables - making it the joint-highest scoring copy of the comic to date.The broker said its value was further inflated by its storied association with Hollywood star CageThe Con Air and National Treasure star purchased this particular copy in 1996 for $150,000 - a record at the time.But the comic was stolen during a party at Cage's home in 2000 and only found - inside a storage unit in California - in 2011.\"During that 11-year period, it skyrocketed in value. The thief made Nicolas Cage a lot of money by stealing it,\" said Metropolis/ComicConnect CEO Stephen Fishler.Cage was reunited with the copy and, six months later, sold it at auction for $2.2m.Fishler compared the comic's history to the brazen theft of Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa from the Louvre museum in Paris in 1911, which transformed the then little-known work to the world's most famous painting.\"The recovery of the painting made the Mona Lisa go from being just a great Da Vinci painting to a world icon - and that's what Action No 1 is. An icon of American pop culture.\"",

    "body": "The family of Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has accused a hospital of negligence over the death of her 21-month-old son.Nkanu Nnamdi died at a hospital in Nigeria on Wednesday following a short illness, leaving the family of the acclaimed postcolonial feminist writer \"devastated\".Now, the family allege there was a litany of failures at Euracare Hospital in Lagos that led to the toddler's death, including being denied oxygen and being given too much sedation, causing a heart attack.The hospital expressed its \"deepest sympathies\" over the loss of the child but denied improper care, which it said had been in line with international standards.It added that Nkanu had arrived at the hospital \"critically ill\" and that an investigation into the death was now under way.Adichie's sister-in-law, Dr Anthea Nwandu, made a series of allegations about the hospital in an interview with Nigerian broadcaster Arise TV on Saturday.In it, she said the medical director of Euracare had told Adichie her son \"had received too much sedation\", which subsequently caused him to have a heart attack.Dr Nwandu also accused medical staff of leaving the child unattended, denying him oxygen and transporting him in a manner that was \"not according to standard practice\".She alleged Nkanu suffered a brain injury due to lack of oxygen.Similar accusations concerning Nkanu's care were made in a private message from Adichie that was leaked online. Her spokeswoman Omawumi Ogbe told the BBC that the message had originally been shared within \"a close circle of family and friends\", and \"was not for public consumption\".Ms Ogbe continued: \"While we are saddened that such a deeply personal account of grief and trauma was leaked, the details therein highlight the devastating clinical failures the family is now forced to confront.\"We hope that the substance of that message, detailing the gross medical negligence that led to this tragedy remains the central focus even as we look forward to the truth and accountability.\"Nkanu was one of twin boys Adichie shared with her husband, Dr Ivara Esege.Responding to the allegations, Euracare Hospital acknowledged the \"profound and unimaginable loss\" the family was experiencing, but said in a statement on Saturday that \"reports currently being circulated contain inaccuracies\".It said Nkanu, who was critically ill, had been referred to the hospital after receiving treatment from two paediatric centres, and that upon arrival staff \"immediately provided care in line with established clinical protocols and internationally accepted medical standards, including the administration of sedation\".It continued: \"In the course of his care, we worked collaboratively with external medical teams as recommended by his family and ensured that all necessary clinical support was provided.\"However, \"despite these concerted efforts\", the boy died less than 24 hours after arriving at the hospital, it added.A \"detailed investigation\" was under way, Euracare said, adding that it remained \"committed to engaging transparently and responsibly with all clinical and regulatory processes\".Adichie, 48, had her first child, a daughter, in 2016. Her twin boys were born using a surrogate in 2024.The award-winning US-based writer is known for works including Half of a Yellow Sun, Americanah and her 2012 Ted Talk and essay We Should All Be Feminists, which was sampled by Beyoncé on her 2013 song Flawless.Nigeria's president was among those to have expressed their condolences over the death of Nkanu.The African nation's health system has suffered of late from a severe shortage of doctors, leaving healthcare staff working long hours and doctors juggling jobs in both public and private hospitals.Responding to the allegations concerning Nkanu, an adviser to the Lagos State government said it \"places the highest value on human life and maintains zero tolerance for medical negligence or unprofessional conduct\".Dr Kemi Ogunyemi, Special Adviser to the Lagos State Governor on health matters, confirmed the state's health watchdog had commenced a \"thorough, independent and transparent\" investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death.\"Any individual or institution found culpable of negligence, professional misconduct, or regulatory violations will face the full wrath of the law,\" Dr Ogunyemi said.She urged members of the public to avoid speculation over the death while the official investigation was ongoing.",

    "body": "Elon Musk has said critics of his social media site X are looking for \"any excuse for censorship\", after its artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot Grok drew criticism over its use to create sexualised images of people without their knowledge or consent.Ofcom says it is conducting an urgent assessment of X in response, with the backing of Technology Secretary Liz Kendall.But the chairwomen of Parliament's technology and media committees have both said they are concerned that \"gaps\" in the Online Safety Act might hinder the media regulator's ability to deal with the matter.X has now limited the use of AI image function to those who pay a monthly fee, a change dubbed by Downing Street as \"insulting\" to victims of sexual violence.The BBC has seen several examples of the free AI tool undressing women and putting them in sexual situations without their consent.Kendall said on Friday that she expects an update from Ofcom within days, and that it would have the government's full support should it decide to block X in the UK.Musk reposted a number of messages on the site overnight criticising the government's reproval of Grok - including one which showed AI-generated images of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in a bikini.\"They just want to suppress free speech,\" Musk wrote.Ashley St Clair, the mother of one of Elon Musk's children, told BBC Newshour on Friday that Grok had generated sexualised photos of her as a child. The conservative influencer said her image had been \"stripped\" to appear \"basically nude, bent over\", despite her telling Grok that she did not consent to the sexualised images.St Clair, who filed a lawsuit against Musk in 2025 seeking sole custody of their child, accused the social media site of \"not taking enough action\" to tackle illegal content, including child sexual abuse imagery. \"This could be stopped with a singular message to an engineer,\" she said.As of Friday morning, Grok was telling users asking it to alter images uploaded to X that \"image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers\", adding users \"can subscribe to unlock these features\".An Ofcom spokesperson said on Friday: \"We urgently made contact [with X] on Monday and set a firm deadline of today to explain themselves, to which we have received a response.\"We're now undertaking an expedited assessment as a matter of urgency and will provide further updates shortly.\"Ofcom's powers under the Online Safety Act include being able to seek a court order to prevent third parties from helping X raise money or be accessed in the UK - should the firm refuse to comply.But Dame Chi Onwurah, chairwoman of the innovation and technology committee, said she was \"concerned and confused\" about how the matter is \"actually being addressed\", and has written to Ofcom and Kendall for clarification.Dame Chi said it was \"unclear\" under the Online Safety Act whether the creation of such images using AI was illegal, as was the responsibility of social media sites for what was shared on their platforms.\"The act should really make something so harmful to so many people clearly illegal, and X's responsibility should be clear,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.Caroline Dinenage, chairwoman of the culture, media and sport committee, likewise said she had a \"real fear that there is a gap in the regulation\".\"There are doubts as to whether the Online Safety Act actually has the power to regulate functionality - that means generative AI's ability to nudify someone's image,\" she told BBC Breakfast.The use of Grok to generate non-consensual sexualised images has been condemned by politicians on all sides: Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called it \"disgraceful\" and \"disgusting\"Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said it was \"horrible in every way\" and that X \"needs to go further\" than the changes it had made to Grok on Friday, but he added that banning the platform would be an attack on free speech The Liberal Democrats called for access to X to be temporarily restricted in the UK while the social media site was investigated.Elsewhere, Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he agreed with Starmer that the material was \"completely abhorrent\".\"It, once again, is an example of social media not showing social responsibility,\" Albanese said, adding that Australia's digital safety commissioner was looking at the situation.\"Australians and indeed, global citizens deserve better.\"Meanwhile, Grok was temporarily suspended in Indonesia on Saturday. The country's digital minister said \"non-consensual sexual deepfakes [were] a serious violation of human rights, dignity and the security of citizens in the digital space\".",

    "body": "US forces have seized another tanker in the Caribbean Sea, officials say, as the Trump administration continues its efforts to control exports of Venezuelan oil. The tanker, the Olina, is on multiple countries' sanctions lists and the fifth vessel to be seized by the US in recent weeks.The US is using the seizures to pressure Venezuela's interim government and remove the so-called dark fleet of tankers from service.  Officials say this fleet consists of more than 1,000 vessels that transport sanctioned and illicit oil.\"Once again, our joint interagency forces sent a clear message this morning: 'there is no safe haven for criminals,'\" said the US military's Southern Command on Friday.The vessel reportedly left Venezuelan waters late on Sunday, after the US seized  President Nicolás Maduro in an early morning raid.Officials said Friday's operation was carried out before dawn by Marines and sailors in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, and that it was seized after it \"departed Venezuela attempting to evade US forces\".  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X that it was \"another 'ghost fleet' tanker ship suspected of carrying embargoed oil\".Noem also shared a video appearing to show troops dropping onto a ship from a helicopter, and described the operation as \"safe\" and \"effective\".Maritime risk company Vanguard Tech said the vessel was attempting to break through the US naval blockade in the Caribbean. It had been sailing under a false flag registered to Timor-Leste, according to the International Maritime Organization.Vanguard Tech added that the vessel's location tracker was last active 52 days ago, northeast of Curacao, and that \"the seizure follows a prolonged pursuit of tankers linked to sanctioned Venezuelan oil shipments in the region\".The US had sanctioned the Olina last January, then named Minerva M, accusing it of helping finance Russia's war in Ukraine by moving Russian oil to foreign markets.Earlier this week, the US said it seized two other tankers linked to Venezuelan oil exports in \"back-to-back\" operations in the North Atlantic and Caribbean.One of them was the Russian-flagged Marinera seized with the help of the UK Royal Navy, which gave logistical support by air and sea.The Marinera is allegedly part of shadow fleet carrying oil for Venezuela, Russia and Iran, breaking US sanctions. US officials said that Marinera was falsely flying the flag of Guyana last month, which made it stateless.US authorities alleged the second tanker - the M/T Sophia - was \"conducting illicit activities\".Experts have told BBC Verify that under UN international maritime law, authorities can board a stateless vessel.President Donald Trump  says Venezuela - which has the world's largest proven oil reserves - \"will be turning over\" up to 50 million barrels of oil worth some $2.8bn (£2.1bn) to the US.The oil, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, would be sold \"in the marketplace at market rates\" and that the US would control how the proceeds were dispersed \"in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people\".Meanwhile on Friday, US diplomats visited the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, to assess the possibility of re-opening an embassy in the Latin American country. Diplomatic ties between the US and Venezuela were severed by Maduro in 2019. The new Venezuelan authorities have said they're engaged in exploratory talks on restoring relations.",

    "body": "2 days agoSarah SmithNorth America editorWatch: BBC asks Trump why US owning Greenland is importantPresident Donald Trump says the US needs to \"own\" Greenland to prevent Russia and China from doing so.\"Countries have to have ownership and you defend ownership, you don't defend leases. And we'll have to defend Greenland,\" Trump told reporters on Friday, in response to a question from the BBC.The US will do it \"the easy way\" or \"the hard way\", he added. The White House recently said the administration was considering buying the semi-autonomous territory of fellow Nato member Denmark, but it would not rule out the option of annexing it by force.Denmark and Greenland say the territory is not for sale. Denmark has said military action would spell the end of the trans-Atlantic defence alliance.Greenland's party leaders, including the opposition, reiterated their call for the \"US's disregard for our country to end\" in a joint statement on Friday night.\"We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders,\" they said. \"The future of Greenland must be decided by the Greenlandic people.\"Despite being the most sparsely populated territory, Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks, and for monitoring vessels in the region.The US president has repeatedly said that Greenland is vital to US national security, claiming without evidence that it was \"covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place\".The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland's north-western tip - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two.Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.But Trump told reporters in Washington that a lease agreement was not good enough.\"Countries can't make nine-year deals or even 100-year deals,\" he said, adding that they had to have ownership. \"I love the people of China. I love the people of Russia,\" Trump said. \"But I don't want them as a neighbour in Greenland, not going to happen.\"And by the way, Nato's got to understand that.\"Denmark's Nato allies - major European countries as well as Canada - have rallied to its support this week with statements reaffirming that \"only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations\".Stressing they were as keen as the US on Arctic security, they have said this must be achieved by allies, including the US, \"collectively\".They also called for \"upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders\".Greenlander on Trump takeover threats: 'It makes me feel sick to my stomach'Concerns over the future of the territory resurfaced after Trump's use of military force against Venezuela on Saturday to seize its president, Nicolás Maduro. Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, during his first presidential term, only to be told it was not for sale.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is to hold talks with Denmark next week.In recent years, there has been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources - including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron - which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. Scientists think it could also have significant oil and gas reserves.",

    "body": "7 hours agoBen HattonSonora Public Security SecretariatA fire that broke out at discount shop in Mexico has killed at least 23 people and injured 11 others, local officials say.The blaze broke out on Saturday in the centre of the north-western city of Hermosillo at a branch of Waldo's - Mexico's largest discount chain.Multiple local authorities described the incident as an explosion, though regional Governor Alfonso Durazo said the exact cause had yet to be determined. The Sonora state public security secretariat said it had ruled out the possibility it was an attack or act of deliberate violence against civilians.  Children are among the victims, officials said, with a 15-year-old girl among those taken to hospital.Images from the scene show thick, black smoke billowing from the building, with the flames appearing to have spread to cars parked in front of the shop.After the fire was extinguished, scorch marks can be seen rising from the shop's doors and windows, one of which appears completely destroyed. The car immediately in front of this window is entirely burnt out.\"To the families who lost a loved one... I share your pain and offer you my full solidarity,\" Durazo said in a video address.He added that an \"extraordinary, transparent and thorough\" investigation had been launched to clarify the causes of the incident and determine who was responsible.Sonora state's Attorney General Gustavo Salas Chávez told reporters early on Sunday that most of those killed had died due to \"exposure to toxic gases\".He said there was no indication that the fire had been started intentionally, but added that he could not rule out an investigation into the cause.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum wrote on social media: \"My heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives.\"Waldo's shops are a common sight on Mexico high streets, with hundreds of outlets across the country.The fire comes on the weekend when Mexico celebrates the Day of the Dead, where festivities are held for people to honour deceased loved ones.The state government said it was cancelling cultural events planned for Sunday after the incident.",

    "body": "Shares worth €1.3bn (£1.1bn; $1.5bn) have been seized from the company that controls the manufacturer of Campari over alleged tax evasion, Italian police have said.Officials ordered the confiscation of the Campari Group shares from Luxembourg-based Lagfin as part of a year-long investigation into how it absorbed its Italian arm.It is accused of failing to pay a similar figure to that of the shares seized in taxes during that merger. The company said it had always acted according to tax laws.Campari - which also produces alcohol brands including Aperol, Grand Marnier and Courvoisier - said neither it nor its subsidiaries were involved in the case. However, chair Luca Garavoglia is among those under investigation, local media reports.Lagfin - which owns more than 50% of Campari shares and has 80% of voting rights - told the BBC in a statement that it had \"always acted in the most scrupulous respect of any applicable laws and regulations, including any Italian tax laws\".Prosecutors in Milan launched a probe into the company last year. Financial police said on Friday that they allegedly found €5.3bn of undeclared capital gains between 2018 and 2020 on which it had not paid a so-called \"exit tax\", levied on firms that transfer their headquarters abroad.It is also accused of transferring its Italian assets into foreign ownership solely for tax purposes, according to Italian financial newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore.Mr Garavoglia, the billionaire who inherited ownership of Campari from his late mother, is implicated alongside Giovanni Berto, the head of Campari's Italian branch, local media reports.Lagfin said it will \"defend itself vigorously\" in the matter, which it characterised as a \"tax dispute\".The company stressed that Campari had never been involved \"in any manner whatsoever\" in the matter, adding that, as it held 80% of Campari's voting rights, the seizure was \"absolutely unable to affect the position of Lagfin as controlling shareholder of Campari\".One of the largest global producers of spirits, Campari is valued at around €7bn on the Milan Stock Exchange.The company has its roots in 1860, when Gaspare Campari's homemade bitter liqueur became a popular tipple among patrons of his Milan bar. It became so successful that, in 1904, his family began manufacturing it commercially, and from the 1990s onwards the firm began acquiring other alcohol brands.",

    "body": "The number of people killed in Jamaica as a result of Hurricane Melissa has risen to 28, the Caribbean nation's prime minister has announced.Andrew Holness confirmed nine other deaths on Saturday, adding that there were reports of possible fatalities still being verified - suggesting the figure may yet rise.Emergency responders and aid agencies have struggled to reach certain parts of the island in the aftermath of the storm due to blocked roads, debris and flooding.The category five hurricane - the strongest type - has caused dozens of deaths across the Caribbean, bringing powerful winds and landslides to Cuba and Haiti.The full scale of the destruction Melissa wrought on Jamaica has only become clear in the past few days as the hurricane knocked out communication systems and power to much of the island after it made landfall on Tuesday.Communities on the island's western portion, such as Black River and Montego Bay, have seen the worst of the destruction.Images have emerged showing buildings razed to the ground, debris and belongings strewn on streets, and whole neighbourhoods still under floodwater.The Red Cross says that 72% of people across Jamaica still do not have electricity and around 6,000 are in emergency shelters.Jamaican officials confirmed to news agency AFP that multiple field hospitals were being established to treat people in the worst-affected areas in the west.Aid reaching those in need was initially held up by the temporary closure of Jamaica's airports. Now that it is arriving in the country, landslides, downed power lines and fallen trees have made certain roads impassable - complicating its distribution.With so many in need of clean drinking water, food and medicine, there have been reports of desperate people entering supermarkets and pharmacies to gather what they can.Melissa has become the most powerful storm on record to hit Jamaica, and one of the strongest seen in the Caribbean.At its peak, the hurricane had sustained winds of 185mph (295 km/h). A category five hurricane - those capable of catastrophic damage - has winds in excess of 157mph.At least 31 people have been killed in Haiti as a result of Melissa, while at least two deaths have been reported in the Dominican Republic.In Cuba, thousands of people have been evacuated as more than 60,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed.The impact of climate change on the frequency of storms is still unclear, but increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above and make more energy available to drive hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons. As a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall.Ahead of the start of this year's Atlantic hurricane season, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted above-normal activity.",

    "body": "The Kenyan government has confirmed that 21 people have died following a landslide in the western part of the country after heavy rainfall. Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen said the bodies had been transferred to a nearby airstrip after the landslide in Marakwet East late on Friday night.He said on X that more than 30 people were still unaccounted for after being reported missing by their families while 25 people with serious injuries had been airlifted to receive further medical attention.The Kenyan Red Cross, which is helping to coordinate rescue efforts, said that the most affected areas are still not accessible by road due to mudslides and flash flooding. The Kenyan government paused the search and rescue operation on Saturday evening but said it would resume on Sunday.\"Preparation to supply more food and non-food relief items to the victims is underway,\" said Murkomen, adding: \"Military and police choppers are on standby to transport the items.\"Kenya is in its second rainy season when it usually experiences a few weeks of wet weather compared to a heavier, more prolonged period earlier in the year. The government has urged people living near seasonal rivers as well as areas that experienced landslides on Friday to move to safer ground.Meanwhile, flash flooding and landslides in Uganda, near the border with Kenya, have killed a number of people since last Wednesday.On Saturday, the Uganda Red Cross said another mudslide had occurred in Kapsomo village in the east of the country, destroying a house and killing four people inside. The Red Cross said floods had severely affected most villages near riverbanks in the Bulambuli District. It said continuous heavy rainfall had caused the River Astiri and the River Sipi \"to overflow, resulting in widespread destruction of homes, crop fields, and community infrastructure\".",

    "body": "20 hours agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondent, in KyivUkraine's top military commander has admitted his soldiers are facing \"difficult conditions\" defending Pokrovsk - a key eastern front-line town - against massed Russian forces.Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Ukrainian troops were fending off a \"multi-thousand enemy\" force - but denied Russian claims that they were surrounded or blocked.He confirmed that elite special forces had been deployed to protect key supply lines which, army sources said, were all under Russian fire.The defence ministry in Moscow reported that Ukrainian troops were surrendering and 11 of their special forces had been killed after landing by helicopter - something denied by Kyiv.Gen Syrskyi said in a social media post on Saturday that he was \"back on the front\" to personally hear the latest reports from military commanders on the ground in the eastern Donetsk region.In a short video, Syrskyi is seen studying battlefield maps with other commanders, including the head of Ukraine's military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov.It is unclear when or where the footage was recorded.Ukrainian media earlier reported that Budanov was in the region to personally oversee the operation by the special forces.The deployment of special forces suggests officials in Kyiv are determined to try to hold on to the town, which Russia has been trying to seize for more than a year.Ukraine's 7th Rapid Response Corps said on Saturday that Ukrainian troops \"have improved [their] tactical position\" in Pokrovsk - but the situation remained \"difficult and dynamic\".Late on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stressed that the defence of Pokrovsk was a \"priority\".There have been growing reports of Russian advances around the strategic town to the west of the Russian-seized regional capital of Donetsk. Images shared with news agencies late on Friday appear to show a Ukrainian Black Hawk helicopter deploying about 10 troops near Pokrovsk, although the location and date of the footage could not be verified.Russia's defence ministry said it had thwarted the deployment of Ukrainian military intelligence special forces north-west of the town, killing all 11 troops who landed by helicopter.DeepState, a Ukrainian open-source monitoring group, estimates about half of Pokrovsk is a so-called \"grey zone\" where neither side is in full control.A military source in Donetsk told the BBC that Ukrainian forces were not surrounded but their supply lines were under fire from Russian troops.The US-based Institute for the Study of War said Ukrainian forces had \"marginally advanced\" during recent counter-attacks north of Pokrovsk, but that the town was \"mainly a contested 'grey zone'\".Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula Moscow annexed in 2014.Moscow wants Kyiv to cede the Donetsk and neighbouring Luhansk regions - collectively known as the Donbas - as part of a peace deal, including the parts it currently does not control.Pokrovsk is a key transport and supply hub whose capture could unlock Russian efforts to seize the rest of the region.But Kyiv also believes its capture would help Russia in its efforts to persuade the US that its military campaign is succeeding - and, therefore, that the West should acquiesce to its demands.Washington has grown increasingly frustrated with the Kremlin's failure to move forward with peace negotiations - culminating in US President Donald Trump placing sanctions on two largest Russian oil producers and axing plans for a summit with President Vladimir Putin.Zelensky has publicly agreed with Trump's proposal for a ceasefire that would freeze the war along the current front lines. Putin is refusing to do so, insisting on his maximalist pre-invasion demands that Kyiv and its Western allies see as a de facto capitulation of Ukraine.Additional reporting by Jaroslav Lukiv",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has unveiled renovations to the bathroom in the Lincoln Bedroom, as his remodelling of the White House continues.Trump shared photos of the new bathroom on social media, saying it had been \"renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era\".He claimed the new black and white marble is \"very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!\".It is the latest change Trump has made to the White House this year. In October, its East Wing was demolished to make way for his new multi-million dollar ballroom.The bathroom is a part of Abraham Lincoln's office and cabinet room, which former President Harry Truman fixed up as a part of his massive renovation of the White House in the late 1940s. The wallpaper of Lincoln's office and bedroom was once coloured in green and gold, according to the White House Historical Association. After Trump's remodelling, it now features gold fixtures and accents for the sink, bathtub faucet and shower door, as well as a chandelier. The White House said the renovation was privately funded at no cost to the taxpayer.The US president's attempts to put his own stamp on the White House have prompted criticism from conservation groups and his political opponents.  Trump previously said his ballroom addition to the East Wing would not \"interfere with the current building\". But in October, he said the \"existing structure\" had to be torn down. Trump said the ballroom construction was being fully funded by him and \"some friends of mine - donors\".Conservationists argued Trump should have sought public review before making the changes, which they say would overwhelm the classical style of the White House. The White House hit back at its critics, saying \"unhinged leftists\" were \"clutching their pearls over President Donald J Trump's visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom to the White House - a bold, necessary addition\".Other changes to the White House include his decision in August to pave over grass in the Rose Garden with stone, transforming a lawn into a patio. Trump also added touches of gilded gold all over the Oval Office, including additional portraits framed in gold, gold-framed mirrors and a gold leaf for the presidential seal on the ceiling of the office.In response to his latest bathroom renovation, the Democrats accused Trump of being more focused on remaking the White House than solving the government shutdown.Central to the shutdown, which is now entering its second month, is a dispute over whether to extend health insurance subsidies.\"Donald Trump actually cares more about his toilet than he does about fixing your healthcare,\" Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote in a post on social media.Speaking at an event on Saturday, former US President Barack Obama said Trump has been \"focused on critical issues, like paving over the Rose Garden so folks don't get mud on their shoes and gold plating the Oval Office and building a $300m ballroom\" than resolving the shutdown. \"If you can't visit a doctor, don't worry. He will save you a dance,\" he added. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoMichael Sheils McNameeBusiness reporterChina will begin easing an export ban on automotive computer chips vital to production of cars across the world as part of a trade deal struck between the US and China, the White House has said. The White House confirmed details of the deal in a new fact sheet after Xi Jinping and Donald Trump met in South Korea this week.The nations also reached agreements on US soybean exports, the supply of rare earth minerals, and the materials used in production of the drug fentanyl.  The deal de-escalates a trade war between the world's two largest economies after Trump hit China with tariffs after he entered office this year, leading to rounds of retaliatory tariffs and global business uncertainty.Much of what is in Saturday's fact sheet was announced by Trump and other officials following the meeting between the two leaders. Trump had described the talks, held in South Korea, as \"amazing\", while Beijing had said they had reached a consensus to resolve \"major trade issues\" - but did not immediately release details of the deal. Speaking on Sunday following the release of the fact sheet, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNN: \"We don't want to decouple from China… (But) they've shown themselves to be an unreliable partner.\"One of the issues addressed in the deal was the export of automotive computer chips. There had been concern that a lack of chips from Nexperia, which has production facilities in China, could create global supply chain issues. Nexperia is a Chinese-owned company, but is based in the Netherlands. About 70% of Nexperia chips made in Europe are sent to China to be completed and re-exported to other countries.The fact sheet states that China will \"take appropriate measures to ensure the resumption of trade from Nexperia's facilities in China, allowing production of critical legacy chips to flow to the rest of the world\".It follows Beijing saying on Saturday that it was considering exempting some firms from the ban. Last month, the likes of Volvo Cars and Volkswagen warned a chip shortage could lead to temporary shutdowns at their plants, and Jaguar Land Rover said the lack of chips posed a threat to their business. On other key issues, Beijing will now pause export controls it brought in last month on rare earth minerals - vital in the production of cars, planes and weapons - for a year. The White House also said it would lower tariffs brought in to curb the import of fentanyl into the US, with China agreeing to take \"significant measures\" to deal with the issue. Fentanyl is a synthetic drug manufactured from a combination of chemicals, and while it is approved for medical use in the US, the powerful and highly-addictive substance has since become the main drug responsible for opioid overdose deaths in the US.The chemicals used in its manufacturing, some of which have legitimate uses, are mostly sourced from China. On soybeans, China has committed to buying 12 million tonnes of US soybeans in the last two months of 2025, and 25 million metric tonnes in each of the following three years - which is roughly the level they were previously at. China's decision to stop purchasing soybeans from the US earlier this year denied American farmers access to their largest export market. In response, Trump revived a bailout for farmers which was in place during his first term in office.",

    "body": "2 days agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorPierre Crom/Getty ImagesRob Jetten, 38, is now tipped to become the youngest prime minister in modern Dutch historyCentrist liberal leader Rob Jetten has claimed victory in Wednesday's nail-biting Dutch election, after vote analysis indicated his party could not be beaten by anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders.Jetten's D66 party currently has a narrow lead of 15,000 votes over Wilders' Freedom Party, and Dutch news agency ANP says even though the vote count is not complete, Wilders can no longer win.\"We are the biggest party in the Netherlands! Now we'll get to work for all Dutch people,\" Jetten posted on X. Wilders said it was the electoral council not a news agency that decided the result: \"What arrogance not to wait for that.\"Projections from about 99% of the vote put both parties on 26 seats in the 150-seat parliament - but ANP says Jetten's centrists could win a 27th seat.Jetten, 38, told reporters he was \"very proud of this historic result\" and now felt a great responsibility to form a stable and ambitious government.Wilders had led opinion polls going into Wednesday's election, but Rob Jetten succeeded in winning in some of the main Dutch cities including Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht with a positive campaign using a catchphrase of \"Yes, we can\". No Dutch election race has ever been so close, and if Jetten does become prime minister he will be the youngest in Dutch history.Until now Jetten was careful not to declare victory until all votes were in, but ANP said based on figures from postal voters abroad he could now be declared the winner.Wilders said even if D66 did go on to become the biggest party, his Freedom Party (PVV) would \"not let the Netherlands be broken up by Jetten and his people\".Jetten told reporters that his party had \"shown to the rest of Europe and the world that it is possible to beat the populist movements if you campaign with a positive message\".The Dutch electoral system is based on proportional representation in one nationwide constituency, so whichever party secures most votes wins most seats. Jetten's liberals have so far won 16.9% of the vote, while Wilders' Freedom Party is on 16.7%. As results came in on Thursday, the race was so close that the lead flipped between the two parties.In a sign that he was not ready to concede victory, Wilders dubbed the Dutch news agency \"ANP66\" and shared unfounded claims from social media of vote-rigging. One local authority, in Zaanstad outside Amsterdam, rejected the allegation as \"fabricated\".Although the D66 leader's path to forming a coalition is not straightforward, Jetten has said he wants to make a quick start.Jetten said after the vote that never before had a party won a Dutch election with fewer than 30 seats. He will need the support of at least three other parties to gather the 76 seats needed to form a coalition. The most obvious candidates would be the conservative-liberal VVD, the left-wing Labour (PvdA)-GreenLeft alliance and the Christian Democrats, but it could take months if that is to happen.VVD leader Dilan Yesilgöz has so far ruled out working with the left, but Jetten said he favoured a broad-based government from the centre of Dutch politics.The weekend would be a good chance for all the parties to reflect, before a \"scout\" is given the task next Tuesday of sounding them out. Jetten said he wanted to construct a coalition that represented best the millions of voters who had backed other parties to tackle the main issues, including the housing shortage and asylum and migration.His path to victory has stunned observers. Less than two years ago he led D66 - a party formed by democratic reformers in 1966 - to fifth place and just nine seats. Only a few weeks ago they were still languishing in the opinion polls, but gradually improved as Jetten put in several polished performances in TV debates and even  competed in the final of a TV quiz show 11 days before the election.Outgoing Prime Minister Dick Schoof predicted on Friday that Jetten's task of forming a coalition would prove complicated. \"I reckon I'll still be prime minister at Christmas - I'd be surprised if it happened [by then]\".Schoof, a former chief of Dutch intelligence, was picked for the top job by Geert Wilders, who abandoned his bid to lead the country last year because his prospective coalition partners would not support having a far-right prime minister.Wilders won the last election in November 2023, and a government was only formed in July 2024. Eleven months later, he brought his own government down, in a row with his coalition partners over asylum and migration policy.",

    "body": "France's consumer watchdog has reported fast fashion giant Shein to authorities for selling \"sex dolls with a childlike appearance\" on its website. The Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) said in a statement that the online description and categorisation of the dolls \"makes it difficult to doubt the child pornography nature of the content\", French media reported.Shein told the BBC: \"The products in question were immediately delisted as soon as we became aware of these serious issues.\" It said its team was \"investigating how these listings circumvented our screening measures\".Shein is also \"conducting a comprehensive review to identify and remove any similar items that may be listed on our marketplace by other third-party vendors\".The DGCCRF has reported Shein to French prosecutors as well as Arcom, the country's online and broadcasting regulator, according to French media.The news has emerged just days before Shein is set to open its first permanent physical shop anywhere in the world - in a Parisian department store.The decision to allow Shein to open at BHV Marais, a shop in France's capital city that traces its roots back to 1856, has provoked controversy. The company has faced criticism for its labour practices and environmental record.Shein will open at BHV on Wednesday ahead of other shops across France, all owned by property firm Société des Grands Magasins.Commenting on the dolls sold on Shein's site, France's consumer watchdog warned that \"the dissemination, via an electronic communications network, of child pornography is punishable by up to seven years' imprisonment and a fine of €100,000 (£88,000)\".Shein said it \"maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any content or products that violate our platform policies or applicable laws\".A spokesperson said the fast fashion firm is taking the matter \"extremely seriously\".\"We are taking immediate corrective actions and reinforcing our internal controls to prevent this from happening again,\" they said. Shein has already been fined millions of euros in recent months.In September, France's data protection authority, the Commission Nationale de L'informatique et des Libertés, imposed a €150m (£132m) penalty on Shein for failing to get users' consent to allow \"cookies\" which collect information about people visiting a website.  Shein is contesting the fine, which it called \"wholly disproportionate\" and \"politically motivated\".",

    "body": "Beijing has said it will loosen a chip export ban it imposed after Dutch authorities took over Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands.In September, the Netherlands invoked a Cold War-era law to take control of Nexperia, stating \"serious governance shortcomings\" which could impact the availability of chips - which are critical for making cars - in an emergency.China said in response that it would not re-export Nexperia chips completed in its Chinese factories to Europe. Last month, the likes of Volvo Cars and Volkswagen warned it could lead to temporary shutdowns at their plants. On Saturday, Beijing said it would consider exempting individual firms from the ban.  Around 70% of Nexperia chips made in Europe are sent to China to be completed and re-exported to other countries. On Saturday, the Chinese government said: \"We will comprehensively consider the actual situation of enterprises and grant exemptions to exports that meet the criteria.\" It did not elaborate on what that criteria is, but criticised \"the Dutch government's improper intervention in the internal affairs of enterprises\" which, it said, led to \"the current chaos in the global supply chain\".Last week, in a letter seen by the Reuters news agency, Nexperia told customers it would stop sending chips to China to be processed. It said it was developing \"alternative solutions to ensure supply continuity\" for customers. Nexperia is headquartered in the Netherlands but owned by Wingtech, a company backed by the Chinese government, which acquired the Dutch business in 2018.In October, Zhang Xuezheng, Nexperia's chief executive and the founder of Wingtech, was ousted as the firm's boss after a Dutch court suspended him as a director.The Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs said at the time it was concerned about \"serious managerial shortcomings\" under his leadership and \"observed that Nexperia's operations in Europe were being compromised in an unacceptable manner\". Last month, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) had warned Nexperia chip supplies would only last a few weeks unless the Chinese ban was lifted.\"Without these chips, European automotive suppliers cannot build the parts and components needed to supply vehicle manufacturers and this therefore threatens production stoppages,\" the group said.The latest plans by Beijing to relax its export controls have emerged after US President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping met in South Korea earlier this week.Trump later said the leaders discussed chips, while Beijing's post-meeting readout did not explicitly mention any area of trade.The White House is expected to release a fact sheet later on Saturday detailing its new trade agreement with China.In December 2024, the US government placed Chinese chip manufacturer Wingtech on its so-called \"entity list\", identifying the company as a national security concern.In the UK, Nexperia was forced to sell its silicon chip plant in Newport after MPs and ministers expressed national security concerns. It currently owns a UK facility in Stockport.",

    "body": "Trump tells military to prepare for 'action' against Islamist militants in NigeriaUS President Donald Trump has ordered the military to prepare for action in Nigeria to tackle Islamist militant groups, accusing the government of failing to protect Christians.Trump did not say which killings he was referring to, but claims of a genocide against Nigeria's Christians have been circulating in recent weeks and months in some right-wing US circles.Groups monitoring violence say there is no evidence to suggest that Christians are being killed more than Muslims in Nigeria, which is roughly evenly divided between followers of the two religions.An advisor to Nigeria's president told the BBC that any military action against the jihadist groups should be carried out together.Daniel Bwala said Nigeria would welcome US help in tackling the Islamist insurgents but noted that it was a \"sovereign\" country.He also said the jihadists were not targeting members of a particular religion and that they had killed people from all faiths, or none. Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu has insisted there is religious tolerance in the country and said the security challenges were affecting people \"across faiths and regions\".Trump wrote in a social media post on Saturday that he had instructed the US Department of War to prepare for \"possible action\".He warned that he might send the military into Nigeria \"guns-a-blazing\" unless the Nigerian government intervened, and said that all aid to what he called \"the now disgraced country\" would be cut.Trump added: \"If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!\"US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth replied to the post by writing: \"Yes sir.\"The Department of War is preparing for action. Either the Nigerian Government protects Christians, or we will kill the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.\"Mr Bwala, who said he was a Christian pastor, told the BBC's Newshour programme that Trump had a \"unique way of communicating\" and that Nigeria was not taking his words literally.\"We know the heart and intent of Trump is to help us fight insecurity,\" he said, adding that he hoped Trump would meet Tinubu in the coming days to discuss the issue.Trump earlier announced that he had declared Nigeria a \"Country of Particular Concern\" because of the \"existential threat\" posed to its Christian population. He said \"thousands\" had been killed, without providing any evidence.This is a designation used by the US State Department that provides for sanctions against countries \"engaged in severe violations of religious freedom\".Following this announcement, Tinubu said his government was committed to working with the US and the international community to protect communities of all faiths.\"The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality,\" the Nigerian leader said in a statement.Jihadist groups such as Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province have wrought havoc in north-eastern Nigeria for more than a decade, killing thousands of people - however most of these have been Muslims, according to Acled, a group which analyses political violence around the world.In central Nigeria, there are also frequent clashes between mostly Muslim herders and farming groups, who are often Christian, over access to water and pasture. Deadly cycles of tit-for-tat attacks have also seen thousands killed, but atrocities have been committed on both sides and human rights group say there is no evidence that Christians have been disproportionately targeted.Trump has frequently expressed satisfaction over not having embroiled the US in a war during his tenure, and has cast himself as a peace-making president.But the Republican leader is facing a growing number of voices domestically, particularly from the political right, who have drawn attention to the situation in Nigeria.Additional reporting by Chris Ewokor in Abuja",

    "body": "Three men have been killed in a US strike on an alleged drug-smuggling boat in the Caribbean, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has said. It is the latest in a series of attacks on vessels the Trump administration says are being used to smuggle drugs into the US.Since they began in September, experts have questioned the legality of the strikes under international law, which have drawn strong criticism from Latin American leaders whose citizens have been targeted.Combatting the flow of illegal drugs is a key policy for US President Donald Trump - but some have suggested the strikes are part of efforts to influence politically opposed governments in the region.Hegseth said the boat targeted on Saturday was operated by a designated terrorist organisation - without specifying which one - and had been travelling in international waters when it was hit.The vessel was travelling along a known drug-smuggling route and carrying narcotics, he said, without providing evidence.Hegseth's statement late on Saturday was accompanied by a video that appears to show a blurred-out boat travelling through the water before exploding.Announcements of these strikes are usually accompanied with grainy footage but no evidence of the alleged drug trafficking and few details about who or what was on board each vessel.The Trump administration has previously said that some boats targeted had departed from Venezuela.The Trump administration has insisted that it was targeting \"narco-terrorists\".The BBC's US partner, CBS News, reported that at least 64 people have been killed by American airstrikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific since early September. Colombian President Gustavo Petro has previously described the attacks as \"murder\" and said they were being used by the US to \"dominate\" Latin America.Meanwhile, Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro accused Washington of \"fabricating a war\".The two left-wing leaders have increasingly been at odds with the Trump administration. Following Petro's comments, the US placed sanctions on him and his inner circle, as well as removing Colombia's certification as an ally in the war on drugs. Trump has threatened military action against land targets in Venezuela.But this, he has admitted, may require the consent of the US Congress.However, some US lawmakers, both Democrat and Republican, have said the strikes on vessels also required congressional approval - something Trump has denied. Others have questioned whether the lethal strikes were legal at all.The UN's human rights chief Volker Turk said on Friday that such attacks were a violation of international human rights law. \"Over 60 people have reportedly been killed in a continuing series of attacks carried out by US armed forces... in circumstances that find no justification in international law,\" he said. \"These attacks – and their mounting human cost – are unacceptable.\"Experts in Latin American politics have suggested the strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific were part of a suite of measures designed to influence change in Colombia and Venezuela.The US is among many nations that consider Maduro's election last year as illegitimate, while Trump has been critical of Petro's policies on combatting the drug trade in his country, which has traditionally been a US ally.Washington has steadily been building up a force of warships, fighter jets, marines, spy planes, bombers and drones in the Caribbean over the past few months, which it has framed as part of a crackdown on drug-trafficking but which military analysts say is much larger than what is needed.",

There have been reports of mass executions and crimes against humanity as the RSF fighters stormed the city after an 18-month siege marked by starvation and heavy bombardment.The flow of those fleeing the violence towards the town of Tawila, about 80km (50 miles) west of el-Fasher, had increased in the past few days, the UNHCR's Eujin Byun told the BBC.They were narrating horrendous stories of atrocities, including rape, and the agency was struggling to find enough shelter and food for them, she said.But the RSF has detained one of its militiamen, Abu Lulu, who has been accused of summary executions.The group shared footage showing the fighter's arrest after BBC Verify identified him as being responsible for the execution of multiple unarmed men near el-Fasher.TikTok has confirmed to the BBC that it has banned the account associated with Lulu. It is not clear whether he had controlled the account in his name.Sudan was plunged into a civil war in April 2023 after a vicious struggle for power broke out between its army and the RSF.It has led to a famine and claims of a genocide in the western Darfur region.More than 150,000 people have died in the conflict across the country, and about 12 million have fled their homes in what the UN has called the world's largest humanitarian crisis.The takeover of el-Fasher reinforces the geographic split in the country, with the RSF now in control of western Sudan and much of neighbouring Kordofan to the south, and the army holding the capital, Khartoum, central and eastern regions along the Red Sea.The two warring rivals had been allies - coming to power together in a coup in 2021 - but fell out over an internationally backed plan to move towards civilian rule.Additional reporting by Merlyn Thomas",

    "body": "2 days agoAndrew HardingParis correspondent, ParisThis week's trial of three undercover operatives, accused of helping the Kremlin to wage a hybrid warfare campaign to \"destabilise\" France, sounds like a surefire recipe for drama, sophistication, and intrigue.If only.Over the course of three days, in a spacious, pine-panelled courtroom on the northern edge of Paris, the case against three seemingly unremarkable Bulgarian men, seated behind glass and shadowed by three police officers who seemed absorbed with their own mobile phones, unfolded with all the panache and excitement of a half-whispered lecture in a library.\"I had absolutely no idea where we were.\"\"I did it for the money.\"\"In the future I plan to get involved in charity work.\"These few lines from the men's testimony may help convey the general tone.All three were jailed on Friday for two to four years.But to bemoan the barely audible banality of it all – the dull motives, the mumbled attempts to shift blame, the sullen complaints about prison life and unsatisfactory psychiatric evaluations - is to miss the truth.The banality is the whole point.Like the cheap drones that both Russia and Ukraine now use to patrol their front lines, the three men on trial in courtroom 2.01 at the Palais de Justice in Paris represent a low-budget evolution of modern hybrid warfare.Improvised and startlingly effective.Rising in turn inside their glass cage, Georgi Filipov, Nikolay Ivanov and Kiril Milushev admitted carrying out the acts, but denied working for a foreign power as well as antisemitism.Early one morning in May 2024, on the banks of the River Seine in the heart of Paris, the three men conspired to spray red paint - and filmed themselves doing so - on the Wall of the Righteous, a monument to those who saved French Jews from the Holocaust during World War Two. Thirty-five red handprints were left on the Shoah memorial. Five hundred more were painted elsewhere.It was the first in a series of symbolic attacks in France: pigs' heads placed outside mosques (an act blamed on a group of Serbians); coffins left ominously by the Eiffel Tower; Stars of David painted around the capital.News of each event was swiftly broadcast around the world – not just by regular media outlets, but by the automated army of Russian social media trolls which, according to the French agency monitoring such activity, routinely seeks to weaponise each sliver of news that might raise doubts about the stability of French society, and the strength of Europe's democracies, its institutions, and its values.France is seen as a particularly tempting target for the Kremlin, given its current political and social divisions, its often ambiguous attitude to Nato, its large Muslim and Jewish populations, the increasing popularity of the far right, and a history of close ties to Moscow on both extremes of the political spectrum.In another era, the Kremlin might have used its own deep undercover agents to carry out acts of sabotage or vandalism. But – to make the drone warfare comparison again – why rely solely on valuable assets like highly trained spies, giant ballistic missiles, or submarines used to cut undersea cables, when for a few thousand euros you can, through discreet and easily deniable channels, recruit your own disaffected army of petty criminals, or unemployed wannabe fascists?\"I had absolutely no idea where we were,\" said Georgi Filipov, as he tried to play down his alleged role in the \"red hands\" operation, arguing that he had travelled from Bulgaria simply to make a little money to help with child support payments for his nine-year-old son. He was allegedly paid €1,000 (£875) plus travel expenses.In the dock, Filipov, 36, cut a gaunt but muscular figure, twitching slightly like a boxer before a fight as he attempted to defuse awkward questions about his tattoos. In particular, the swastika on his chest and the social media photos showing him giving a Nazi salute and wearing a t-shirt that claimed Hitler \"was right\".\"I made bad choices in the past,\" Filipov explained, and pointed out that he had already removed several tattoos. The Paris criminal court sentenced him to two years in jail.Having been successfully extradited from Bulgaria and Croatia to face trial in France, the men all sought to place the blame on a fourth man, Mircho Angelov, who remains at large but is alleged to have links to a Russian intelligence officer. He was given a three-year term in absentia.The second defendant, Kiril Milushev, 28, said he had only come to France because he had broken up with his partner, was struggling with a bipolar disorder, and wanted to keep his friend, Mircho, company. He was given two years.Seated beside Milushev, Nikolay Ivanov creased his forehead as he denied any links with Russia. He spoke of his grandparents' role in saving Jews during World War Two and said his ambition now was to obtain a master's degree in law, and to be reunited with his girlfriend - if she'd still have him, when all this was over.Considered the mastermind behind the plot, he was given the heaviest jail term of four years.As for Russia's alleged role in the red-hands affair, even the defence lawyers openly admitted that \"we suspect\" Moscow's hand. But they insisted, as did their clients, that they were unwitting pawns, proxies – one might even say \"drones\" – in a shadow war against the West.",

    "body": "President Samia Suluhu Hassan has been declared the winner of Tanzania's presidential election, securing another term amid days of unrest across the country.Samia won 98% of the votes in Wednesday's poll, the electoral commission said. In her Saturday victory speech she said the election was \"free and democratic\", accusing protesters of being \"unpatriotic\".Opposition parties rejected the results,  calling the vote a mockery of the democratic process as Samia's main challengers had been either imprisoned or barred from running.International observers have expressed concern over the lack of transparency and widespread turmoil that has reportedly left hundreds of people dead and injured.The nationwide internet shutdown is making it difficult to verify the death toll.The government has sought to play down the scale of the violence - and authorities have extended a curfew in a bid to quell the unrest.Receiving her victory certificate on Saturday, Samia, 65, said: \"We thank the security forces for ensuring that the violence did not stop voting. \"The government strongly condemns the violent incidents. These incidents were not patriotic at all,\" she said.Earlier on Saturday, electoral commission chief Jacobs Mwambegele declared Samia \"the winner of the presidential election\".Samia secured about 31.9 million votes, or 97.66% of the total, with turnout nearing 87% of the country's 37.6 million registered voters, the electoral chief said. In Tanzania's semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar - which elects its own government and leader - CCM's Hussein Mwinyi, who is the incumbent president, won with nearly 80% of the vote.The opposition in Zanzibar said there had been \"massive fraud\", the AP news agency reported.Why elections are a time of fear for albino TanzaniansNo protests were reported on Saturday morning, but tension remained high in Dar es Salaam, where security forces manned roadblocks across the port city.On Friday demonstrators Dar es Salaam and other cities took to the streets, tearing down Samia's posters and attacking police and polling stations despite warnings from the army chief to end the unrest.The demonstrations are mostly led by young protesters, who have denounced the election as unfair.They accuse the government of undermining democracy by suppressing the main opposition leaders - one is in jail and another was excluded on technical grounds.A spokesperson from the opposition Chadema party on Friday told AFP news agency that \"around 700\" people had been killed in clashes with security forces, while a diplomatic source in Tanzania told the BBC there was credible evidence that at least 500 people had died.Foreign Minister Mahmoud Kombo Thabit has described the violence as a \"few isolated pockets of incidents here and there\" and said \"security forces acted very swiftly and decisively to address the situation\".In a statement, the UN chief Antonio Guterres said he was  \"deeply concerned\" about the situation in Tanzania, \"including reports of deaths and injuries during the demonstrations\". He urged all parties involved to \"prevent further escalation\".The UK, Canada and Norway have expressed similar concerns, citing \"credible reports of a large number of fatalities and significant injuries, as a result of the security response to protests\".There were two main opposition contenders - Tundu Lissu, who is being held on treason charges, which he denies, and Luhaga Mpina of the ACT-Wazalendo party - but he was excluded on legal technicalities.Sixteen fringe parties, none of whom have historically had significant public support, were allowed to run.Samia's ruling party Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), and its predecessor Tanu, have dominated the country's politics and have never lost an election since independence.Ahead of the election, rights groups condemned government repression, with Amnesty International citing a \"wave of terror\" involving enforced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings of opposition figures.The government rejected the claims, and officials said the election would be free and fair.Samia came into office in 2021 as Tanzania's first female president following the death of President John Magufuli.Additional reporting by Akisa Wandera in Nairobi",

    "body": "A suspect has been arrested after footage which appears to capture the alleged attempted rape of a woman on a train near Paris went viral, local media say. Jhordana Dias, a 26-year-old Brazilian national, was allegedly attacked earlier this month. She told Le Parisien newspaper that the man boarded the train, pushed her and attempted to pull down her underwear. Alerted by her screams, another passenger pulled out her phone to film. The  footage captures a man fleeing as the train pulls into a station. The incident has revived discussions around women's safety in France.According to French media, a man was arrested on Friday evening by transport police in Mantes-la-Jolie, north-west of Paris. He was traced there by investigators, but it is unclear how.He was not carrying identity documentation at the time of his arrest, but told police he was a 26-year-old Egyptian national, media reports say. He remains in custody.The alleged incident took place on 15 October between the Choisy-le-Roi and Villeneuve-le-Roi train stations, south-east of Paris.The video shows shows a man dressed in a black tracksuit and cap onboard a carriage.Over the sound of a woman's cries, the woman filming can be heard saying \"you stay there\" as the man appears to begin approaching her.The train then pulls into a station, and the man disembarks and flees down the platform.The woman who filmed the incident, named in French media only as Marguerite, has since been widely credited as having saved Ms Dias from a more serious attack.Ms Dias, who does not speak French, reportedly filed a complaint with police in Choisy-le-Roi with the help of her brother, who translated her testimony.The footage has been widely circulated on news outlets and social media. prompting many women to share their own experiences of harassment on public transport in France.Two other women have since told Le Parisian that they had been victims of the same man.",

    "body": "Hurricane Melissa is forecast to become a rare category five storm as it turns towards Jamaica, bringing life-threatening flash flooding and landslides.The cyclone, which had winds of up to 120 mph (195 km/h) as of 06:00 GMT, is currently turning north-west in the Caribbean and is expected to make landfall by Tuesday, according to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC).It warns of power cuts and damage to infrastructure as Melissa brings up to 30 inches (76cm) of rain and sea level surges as high as 13ft (4m) above ground. \"Seek shelter now,\" residents have been told.Melissa is the 13th hurricane in this year's Atlantic season, which typically ends in November.A category five hurricane is the strongest type, with winds of at least 157mph. While Melissa is set to weaken to a category four before reaching Jamaica, the NHC said there was \"very little practical difference in the overall impacts\" upon landfall, and that the hurricane will be \"at least that intensity\" when it hits the island.With tropical storm-strength winds and rain already expected well before it passes over central Jamaica - including potentially the capital, Kingston - it warns that \"preparations should be rushed to completion\".\"A multi-day period of damaging winds and heavy rainfall have begun and will cause catastrophic and life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides,\" the meteorological agency urged residents. Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said: \"I know that there are many Jamaicans who are anxious, who are very concerned, and rightfully so: you should be concerned.\"But the best way to address anxiety and any nervousness and concern is to be prepared.\"Residents are being told to secure their homes with sandbags and wooden boards, and to stock up on essentials.Warnings are also in effect parts of Haiti including the capital, Port au Prince, the Dominican Republic and eastern Cuba, where Melissa is anticipated to bring similar effects by the middle of next week.Landslides already being caused by the hurricane have already killed two in Haiti, the nation's Civil Protection agency has said.Melissa is forecast to pass over Cuba by Wednesday before moving through the Antillas Mayores and out into the Atlantic.By the time it reaches Cuba, it is predicted to have weakened to a category three  storm.While it is hard to link individual weather events to climate change, scientists say it is making weather phenomena more common and more severe.Warmer oceans produce more moisture in the air, helping fuel the formation of hurricanes.Ahead of the start of this year's Atlantic hurricane season, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted above-normal activity, citing warmer seas and potential stronger monsoon activity around West Africa - where Atlantic storms often form.",

    "body": "Donald Trump has said he would like to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his upcoming trip to Asia.\"I would. If you want to put out the word, I'm open to it,\" the US president told reporters onboard Air Force One as he departed for the region, adding that he \"had a great relationship\" with Kim. Trump made history during his first term, becoming the first sitting US president to set foot into North Korea when they last shook hands in 2019.His trip to Malaysia and Japan will see him meet a number of world leaders including China's Xi Jinping, amid trade negotiations sparked by Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs earlier this year.Trump has taken an atypical approach to North Korea - a secretive communist totalitarian state largely isolated on the world stage - and its attempts at creating nuclear weapons, initially taunting Kim as a \"little rocket man\".The pair met face-to-face three times during Trump's previous tenure in the White House but failed to agree a denuclearisation programme. North Korea has since conducted multiple tests of intercontinental missiles, its neighbours say.Asked if he would recognise North Korea as a nuclear state, Trump told reporters late on Thursday: \"I think they are sort of a nuclear power... They got a lot of nuclear weapons, I'll say that.\"Kim has said he was open to meeting Trump again, provided the US stopped pursuing its \"absurd\" demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. \"I still have a good memory of President Trump,\" Kim said in a speech last month, according to state media.Friends reunited? Trump faces a very different Kim Jong Un this timeSouth Korea's Unification Minister Chung Dong-young, who handles relations between the North and South, said there was a \"considerable\" chance the two leaders might meet while Trump is in South Korea for the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum, according to news agency AFP.A senior US official told reporters that a meeting was not in Trump's schedule, according to the Anadolu Agency - though their last meeting in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas came off the back of an invitation by Trump on social media.Trump's first stop will be in Malaysia, where he will attend Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit.He is expected to land in the South Korean city Busan on Wednesday ahead of the Apec summit. He will meet South Korean leader Lee Jae Myung, who discussed peace on the Korean peninsula and the possibility of a Trump-Kim meeting while visiting the White House in August.Lee told the BBC he was open to a deal between Trump and Kim in which North Korea agreed to freeze production of its nuclear weapons.Trump's meeting with China's President Xi comes on the backdrop of a trade war between the two nations.The two have agreed to hold off triple-digit tariffs threatened against one another while seeking a trade agreement - but that detente is in jeopardy after Trump said he would level a 100% trade levy on Chinese goods over Beijing's curbs on rare earth exports.The minerals are essential for many electronics and China is currently responsible for around 90% of exports of their refined form.",

    "body": "The US has placed sanctions on Colombia's President, Gustavo Petro, accusing him of failing to curb drug trafficking and allowing cartels to \"flourish\".The decision is the latest in a growing diplomatic dispute between the Latin American nation's first left-wing leader and his US counterpart Donald Trump.The two have clashed over US strikes on boats it says are being used to smuggle drugs, killing dozens including some Colombian nationals. Trump has said other nations had failed to stop the boats, while Petro has accused him of \"murder\".Colombia was once a close ally of Washington's war on drugs, receiving hundreds of millions of dollars annually in military assistance to counter drug gangs.The US also trains Colombian narcotics agents - something the Trump administration has said it will continue to support.But in its sanctions decision, it singled out Petro as having presided over a \"disastrous and ineffective\" drug policy that had led to a large increase in cocaine production.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that since Petro came to power, cocaine production in Colombia had \"exploded to the highest rate in decades, flooding the United States and poisoning Americans\".Sanctions have also been imposed on Colombia's Interior Minister Armando Benedetti, as well as Petro's wife and eldest son. All are barred from accessing assets and any properties they may have in the US. Petro responded that he had been fighting drug trafficking \"for decades\" and that his administration had stemmed the growth of coca crops.\"What the US Treasury is doing is an arbitrariness typical of an oppressive regime,\" he said.Cocaine production is currently at record-high levels in Colombia, according to researcher Héctor Galeano from the Colombia-based Institute of Advanced Social and Cultural Studies of Latin America and the Caribbean.The US Treasury said that cocaine from Colombia was often purchased by Mexican cartels, which then smuggle it into the US.  The US says it is removing Colombia's certification as an ally in the war on drugs, which grants it access to financial support. Colombia responded that it would cease buying weapons from the US.Petro has insisted that it was during the government of his predecessor, Iván Duque, that the area planted with coca had increased.He has also said that, in order for coca cultivation to decrease, what was needed was for demand for cocaine to go down in the US and in Europe.His primary attempts to curb drug-related criminality in Colombia have centred on facilitating peace negotiations between warring cartels that have for decades brought violence to the nation.His campaign promise of bringing \"total peace\" to Colombia appears to be collapsing, with mounting attacks and stalled negotiations.Petro told BBC News in September air strikes on alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean were an \"act of tyranny\".He used a speech at the UN in New York around the same time to argue the attacks were not about controlling the drug trade but serving a need to use \"violence to dominate Colombia and Latin America\".Imposing sanctions on a head of state is rare but not unprecedented. The leaders of countries including Russia, North Korea and Venezuela have previously been sanctioned.",

    "body": "An unnamed donor is giving $130m (£100m) to the Pentagon to help pay US troops during the government shutdown, sparking ethics concerns. US defence officials confirmed the gift, which President Donald Trump said will make up for shortfalls in paying the country's 1.32m service members, but declined to identify the donor.Trump provided a few clues, though, saying on Saturday that he was \"a big supporter of mine\" and a US citizen.The government shut down more than three weeks ago, after lawmakers failed to approve a funding deal. The Trump administration paid troops last week by shifting $8bn from military research, but it is unclear what will happen on the next payday at the end of the month.Now in it's 25th day, the shutdown is poised to become one of the longest in US history.\"The donation was made on the condition that it be used to offset the cost of service members' salaries and benefits,\" Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told reporters on Friday, adding that the money was allowed under the department's \"general gift acceptance authority\".Trump had indicated a donation would be made on Thursday, while also declining to identify the donor, saying \"he doesn't really want the recognition\".However, the New York Times has identified the benefactor as Timothy Mellon, a billionaire and major financial backer of Trump.Mr Mellon is the heir to his influential family's $15bn (£11bn) fortune, according to Forbes, and was heavily involved in the US railway industry before recently becoming more politically active and donating $50m to a group supporting Trump.Before leaving for Asia on Saturday, Trump told reporters at the White House that the donor was a \"great gentleman\", a \"patron\", a \"patriot\" and a \"wonderful man\" who \"doesn't want publicity\".\"He prefers that his name not be mentioned, which is pretty unusual in the world I come from,\" Trump said. \"In the world of politics, you want your name mentioned.\" \"He put up $130 million in order to make sure - that's a lot of money - in order to make sure that the military got paid, and he's a big supporter of mine,\" he continued.The funds amount to around $100 per servicemember. While the White House was able to reallocate defence funds to pay troops last week, it remains to be seen what will happen on the next payday for the military, on  31 October. Congress has been unable to pass a bill that would keep troops being paid during the shutdown.Most government workers have been furloughed, or in some cases, told to work without pay while the shutdown lasts. According to Defence Department rules, donations over $10,000 must be reviewed by ethics officials \"to determine whether the donor is involved in any claims, procurement actions, litigation, or other particular matters involving the Department that must be considered prior to gift acceptance\".Donations from non-American citizens require additional scrutiny. While unusual, the Pentagon does sometimes accept gifts from donors, but they normally must be given to fund specific projects, such as a school, hospital, library, museum, or cemetery. Critics questioned why the US military would accept anonymous funds.  \"Using anonymous donations to fund our military raises troubling questions of whether our own troops are at risk of literally being bought and paid for by foreign powers,\" said Delaware Senator Chris Coons, the top Democrat on the Senate's defense appropriations subcommittee.",

    "description": "Donald Trump has said he is increasing tariffs on goods imported from Canada by 10%, after the province of Ontario aired an anti-tariff advertisement ",
    "body": "Donald Trump has said he is increasing tariffs on goods imported from Canada by 10%, after the province of Ontario aired an anti-tariff advertisement featuring Ronald Reagan.The US president called the advert a \"fraud\" and lashed out at Canadian officials for not removing it ahead of the World Series baseball championship in a social media post on Saturday.Ontario's premier said he would take it down to allow trade talks with the US to proceed, after Trump withdrew - but that it would still run in the US over the weekend.Canada is the only G7 country that has not reached a deal with the US since Trump began seeking to charge steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners.The US has already imposed a 35% levy on all Canadian goods - though most are exempt under an existing free trade agreement. It has also slapped sector-specific levies on Canadian goods, including a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.Trump said while travelling to Asia on Saturday that he was \"increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now\". Tariffs are paid by the companies that import foreign products, not the exporters themselves.Three-quarters of Canadian exports are sold to the US, and Ontario is home to the bulk of Canada's automobile manufacturing.US-Canada trade minister Dominic LeBlanc said of the tariff increase: \"We stand ready to build on the progress made in constructive discussions with American counterparts over the course of recent weeks.\"We will remain focused on achieving results that benefit workers and families in both the United States and Canada, and that progress is best achieved through direct engagement with the US administration.\"Trump's decision comes after Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on Friday that he would pause the anti-tariff advertising campaign \"so that trade talks can resume\", after discussions with Prime Minister Mark Carney.But he said it would still appear during games for the World Series, including between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Los Angeles Dodgers.Trump responded that the advert should have been pulled down \"IMMEDIATELY\". A spokesperson for Ford stood by his statement on Friday.The advert, sponsored by the Ontario government, quotes former US President Ronald Reagan, a Republican and icon of US conservatism, saying tariffs \"hurt every American\".The video takes excerpts from a 1987 national radio address that focused on foreign trade.The Ronald Reagan Foundation, which is charged with preserving the former president's legacy, had earlier criticised the advert for using \"selective\" audio and video and said it misrepresented Reagan's address. It also said the Ontario government had not sought permission to use the footage.While the minute-long advert only includes excerpts from the original, five-minute-long address, it does not alter Reagan's words. It does however alter the order in which he made the comments.Ford had previously pledged to run the Reagan advert in every Republican-led district in the US.Both Trump and Carney will be attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit in Malaysia, but Trump told reporters accompanying him on Air Force One that he had no intention of meeting his Canadian counterpart during the trip. Responding to the Trump's rate hike on Saturday, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said it hoped \"this threat of escalation can be resolved through diplomatic channels and further negotiation\".\"Tariffs at any level remain a tax on America first, then North American competitiveness as a whole,\" the organisation's CEO, Candace Laing, told the BBC.The Reagan advert is not the only way that Ontario – home of the Toronto Blue Jays – is using the World Series as a platform to criticise Trump's tariffs.Ford and California Governor Gavin Newsom jokingly made bets about which team would win the series in a social media video on Friday.Both men repeatedly joked about tariffs in the video, with Ford pledging to send Newsom a can of maple syrup if the LA Dodgers - who are based in Newsom's state - win.\"The tariff might cost me a few extra bucks at the border these days, but it'll be worth it,\" he wrote.In response, Newsom asked Ford to resume allowing American-produced alcohol to be sold in province liquor stores, and pledged to send him \"California's championship-worthy wine\" if the Blue Jays triumph.They ended their exchange both declaring: \"Here's to a great World Series, and a tariff-free friendship between Ontario and California.\"",

    "body": "Two suspects have been arrested over the theft of precious crown jewels from Paris's Louvre museum, French media say.The Paris prosecutor's office said one of the men had been taken into custody as he was preparing to take a flight from Charles de Gaulle Airport.Items worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the world's most-visited museum last Sunday, when four thieves wielding power tools broke into the building in broad daylight.France's justice minister has conceded security protocols \"failed\", leaving the country with a \"terrible image\".The Paris prosecutor's office said in a statement that the arrests had been made on Saturday evening, without specifying how many people had been taken into custody.One of the suspects was preparing to travel to Algeria, police sources have told French media, while it's understood the other was going to Mali.Specialist police can question them for up to 96 hours.The Paris prosecutor criticised the \"premature disclosure\" of information related to the case, adding that it hindered efforts to recover the jewels and find the thieves.The thieves reportedly arrived at 09:30 (06:30 GMT), shortly after the museum opened to visitors.The suspects arrived with a vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine.Pictures from the scene showed the ladder leading up to a first-floor window.Two of the thieves entered by cutting through the window with power tools.They then threatened the guards, who evacuated the premises, and cut through the glass of two display cases containing jewels.A preliminary report has revealed that one in three rooms in the area of the museum raided had no CCTV cameras, according to French media.French police say the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38.The museum's director told French senators this week that the only camera monitoring the exterior wall of the Louvre where they broke in was pointing away from the first-floor balcony that led to Gallery of Apollo.CCTV around the perimeter was also weak and \"ageing\", Laurence des Cars said, meaning that staff failed to spot the gang early enough to stop the theft.Experts have also expressed concern that the jewels may have already been broken up into hundreds of pieces.Gold and silver can be melted down and the gems can be cut up into smaller stones that will be virtually impossible to track back to the robbery, Dutch art detective Arthur Brand told the BBC. Security measures have since been tightened around France's cultural institutions.The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following the heist. They will now be stored in the Bank's most secure vault, 26m (85ft) below the ground floor of its elegant headquarters in central Paris.",

    "body": "Trump hopes China will help push Russia towards Ukraine peace talks23 hours agoTiffany WertheimerReutersTrump and Xi last met in person in 2019, during Trump's first term as presidentDonald Trump has said he would like China's help to deal with Russia as he seeks to bring an end to the war in Ukraine.\"I'd like China to help us out with Russia,\" the US president said on board Air Force One, as he flew to Asia for a whirlwind tour, where he will meet China's Xi Jinping in South Korea.It could be wishful thinking, however. China is Russia's biggest ally, and a vital support to Moscow since Western sanctions were imposed over its war in Ukraine.Trump's comments come off the back of a difficult week for Kyiv - the US refused to give it Tomahawk cruise missiles, EU leaders did not release frozen Russian cash to help fund its defence, and there have been more deadly strikes.Ending the Russia-Ukraine war has become a focal point for Trump in recent months, with a ceasefire deal so far eluding him, despite his campaign promises to solve the situation quickly. A summit with Putin in August failed to yield any tangible results, and Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Moscow.\"Every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere,\" Trump said earlier this week.On Wednesday, he announced new sanctions against Russia's two biggest oil companies - the first direct interventions the Trump administration has imposed on Russia over the war. What effect the blacklisting will have in the long-term is yet to be seen, but the Kremlin said it was \"immune\" to the sanctions.What's the significance of US sanctions on Russian oil?While Trump's meeting with Xi on Thursday is still expected to focus on the hostile trade relations between the US and China, Trump said that he would talk to Xi about \"everything\", including the war in Ukraine.\"I'd like to see China help us out [with Russia]. I have a very good relationship... with President Xi. Very good,\" he said, adding that Xi wants to see the war end.Earlier this week, Trump said that the Chinese president \"can have a big influence on Putin\".SPUTNIK/KREMLIN POOL/EPA/ShutterstockPutin, Xi and Kim showed their solidarity when the three met in Beijing last monthBeijing has never criticised Russia's war in Ukraine, and has been accused by the US and its allies of aiding Russia's war effort - which Beijing denies - through its purchases of Russian oil and monthly supply of dual-use materials (those with both commercial and military applications).Putin and Xi have previously touted their countries' relationship as a \"friendship with no limits\", and Russia hopes gas exports to China and other countries will replace the revenue lost after Western sanctions were imposed.Xi, Putin and Kim show united front at huge Chinese military paradeRussia's Putin hails 'unprecedented' ties with China at talks in BeijingThe warm relations between Russia and China were on full display last month, when Putin, Xi and North Korea's Kim Jong Un met in Beijing for an extraordinary show of solidarity and military might.EPA/ShutterstockRussian strikes on Kyiv left killed several people and caused huge damage on SaturdayAs Trump made his comments on Air Force One, emergency crews in Ukraine were at the scene of more Russian strikes, including some in Kyiv where several people were killed, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said.\"No country should be left alone in the face of such evil,\" he wrote on Telegram, reiterating the need for Ukraine's allies to step-up support.Meanwhile, in Russia's Belgorod region, residents living near a dam were told to evacuate after a Ukrainian strike on the local reservoir caused damage that could lead to flooding.More on this story",

    "body": "Connolly declared president of Ireland after landslide win15 hours agoAuryn CoxBBC News NICatherine Connolly: \"I will be an inclusive president for all\"Catherine Connolly has been elected as the president of Ireland after a landslide victory.She has become the 10th president of the Republic of Ireland after defeating Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys, who had already conceded to her rival.The result, long clear from early tallies, was officially declared at Dublin Castle.Connolly – an independent who was backed by the major left-wing parties – pledged to be \"an inclusive president for all\" in her acceptance speech.The 68-year-old, from Galway, has been a TD (member of the Irish parliament) since 2016.She will be the country's 10th president, taking over from Michael D Higgins who has served the maximum two terms in officeConnolly secured 914,143 first preference votes (63%) - a record in Irish presidential election history. She made her acceptance speech first in Irish and then in English.\"I will be a president who listens and reflects and who speaks when it's necessary,\" she said.\"I will be a voice for peace, a voice that builds on our policy of neutrality, a voice that articulates the existential threat posed by climate change, and a voice that recognises the tremendous work being done the length and breadth of the country.\"Dublin correspondent Gabija Gataveckaite said Connolly was the anti-establishment candidate who took on Humphreys, the government's pick.She said in recent weeks, Connolly had been insisting her campaign was a \"movement\" and she has now won a clear mandate from the people.When spoilt votes were excluded, Humphreys won 29% of first preference votes, while Fianna Fail's Jim Gavin, who withdrew from the race but remained on the ballot paper, won 7% first preference votes.There were 213,738 spoiled votes, an unprecedented amount, and a turnout of 46%.Cavan–Monaghan was the only constituency won by Humphreys, who had represented it from 2011-2024.ReutersHeather Humphreys shook hands with Catherine Connolly, whose family joined her on the stageHumphreys, who spoke after Connolly, thanked everyone who voted for her, her campaign team and Fine Gael for the nomination.\"I know Catherine will be a president for all of us. Catherine will be my president and I want to wish her well, this is her evening,\" she said.The president of Ireland is the country's head of state. They represent the country abroad, take centre stage at major national events, and are responsible for ensuring that the constitution – the set of rules for government and politics - is followed.While the president's powers are limited, the office-holder's influence can be profound.Connolly will be inaugurated on 11 November with Higgins leaving office the day before.Higgins said he had rang Connolly to congratulate her \"on what is a momentous day for her and her family\".\"The president-elect will have the full support of this office as she prepares for her inauguration next month,\" he added.'Woman with a very independent mind'Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Micheál Martin said an \"outstanding honour\" had been bestowed upon Connolly.\"The people have spoken resoundingly and given Catherine a tremendous majority and a very clear mandate,\" he said.Tánaiste (Ireland's deputy prime minister) Simon Harris said: \"The great thing about this country is that we live in enduring democracy.\"We have an election, we go at it hammer and tongs and then we come together proudly behind the winner of the election.\"Earlier he acknowledged the high level of spoiled votes, saying he saw \"people going to quite a lot of effort to spoil their ballot\".Sinn Féin, the main opposition party in the Irish parliament, gave its support to Connolly after deciding not to run its own candidate.The party's president Mary Lou McDonald described the result as a \"stunning victory\" and said Connolly needed the support of her party in the presidential election campaign.Speaking at Dublin Castle on Saturday, Ms McDonald said: \"It is a victory for the combined opposition over the jaded worn-out politics of Fianna Fail and Fine Gael.\"Sinn Féin as the largest political party, of course it was a significant element of the campaign.\"And Catherine has asserted quite correctly that she is an independent candidate, a woman with a very independent mind.\"Connolly sought out to establish herself as a united Ireland candidate and said she would like to see a border poll on the island of Ireland during her presidency, which runs for seven years.In Northern Ireland, First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the win marked \"an era of hope\".\"This election has shown what can be achieved when parties committed to change and progress work together in common purpose,\" she said.\"That is the clear pathway to a better, united future.\"",

    "body": "2 days agoWill GrantMexico, Central America and Cuba correspondentAn audacious attempted escape by one of the world's most wanted fugitives has been brought to an abrupt end, with the drug kingpin now facing charges in the US.In a late-night communique on Thursday, the Cuban Government said that it had extradited a Chinese citizen, Zhi Dong Zhang, to the authorities in Mexico. Hours later, Mexico's security chief then confirmed his subsequent extradition to the US on drug trafficking and money laundering charges.Known by various aliases including Brother Wang, Pancho and HeHe, Zhi Dong Zhang is accused by the US Justice Department of masterminding a vast international ring of fentanyl trafficking and money laundering covering numerous nations but particularly China, Mexico and the US.The list of charges against Mr Zhang is long, but in essence US prosecutors and the Mexican Attorney General's office accuse him of being a major player in the global drug trade. They say he has laundered millions of dollars in drug money for both the Sinaloa Cartel and the New Generation Jalisco Cartel (CJNG) as part of a worldwide drug distribution network.\"Brother Wang can be seen as a key link between Mexican cartels and Chinese chemical companies in sourcing the pre-cursor chemicals for fentanyl,\" former DEA agent Mike Vigil said, adding that he was also vital in converting drug funds into cryptocurrency.If convicted, Mr Zhang can expect to share a similar fate as other drug kingpins like Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman and Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada in a high-security facility in the United States.But how \"Brother Wang\" ended up in custody in Havana is an extraordinary tale involving fleeing house arrest in Mexico City, reportedly through a hole in a wall, taking a private jet to Cuba and an ultimately failed attempt to enter Russia.Mr Zhang was arrested in Mexico City in a joint security operation in October 2024. He was initially held in a maximum-security prison but was later granted house arrest by a judge – a decision that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum called \"outrageous\".Mr Zhang's escape had all the hallmarks of another embarrassing episode for Mexico: a man considered a vital cog in the machinery of drug smuggling, able to disappear from under the noses of the Mexican authorities tasked with guarding him. \"El Chapo\" Guzman managed that feat twice, much to Washington's frustration, before he was finally put on a plane in handcuffs to the US.That Mexican authorities were able to recover their prisoner and send him north came down to two things – an apparent stroke of luck in Russia and the strength of Mexico's security relationship with Havana.When Mr Zhang reached Cuba in July 2025, he set about making his next steps towards reaching a country with no extradition treaty with the US, officials say. There is a direct commercial flight to Moscow from Havana and Mr Zhang, they allege, was able to secure a seat on it using fake papers. However, the papers didn't get him past the immigration authorities in Russia. It has been reported that the Russians didn't fully appreciate who they had in their custody and, after he was briefly detained, they turned Mr Zhang around and sent him back to Cuba.On arriving back in Havana a second time, the Cuban security services were now aware of his real identity.Security analysts believe the authorities in Cuba held onto him for several months to interrogate him at length before sending him back to Mexico and, inevitably, onwards to the US. Mexico's Public Security Secretary, Omar Harfuch, was quick to thank Cuba for its co-operation – ultimately, for sparing Mexican blushes over another escaped high-profile prisoner.As always following the arrest of an alleged kingpin, the question becomes how far their removal will affect the global drug trade.Given Mr Zhang has spent the past year either in prison, under house arrest or on the run, the question may be moot, Mr Vigil said, as his absence has already largely been felt in Mexico's criminal underworld.\"It's really not going to have an impact as the cartels already have individuals working for them who can start to replace Brother Wang,\" said Mr Vigil. \"Even in the case of El Chapo Guzman, who was a much bigger figure, it had no impact on the global drug trade\", he argued.Over his first year in office, US President Donald Trump has pressured his Mexican counterpart to do more on the issue of fentanyl trafficking and Sheinbaum's administration has duly responded in kind. She has significantly increased seizures of the drug compared to her predecessor and her administration has sent dozens of convicted drug cartel members to the US to serve sentences there. They included several high-level drug names like Rafael Caro Quintero, wanted for the murder of a DEA agent in 1985.Her co-operation on the fentanyl issue, as well as on undocumented immigration, is considered the reason Trump has refrained from imposing the same level of trade tariffs on Mexico as he has on other commercial partners.Mr Zhang's extradition will bring genuine satisfaction in Washington at having taken a key figure in Mexican cartels' financial operations out of circulation. That, in turn, will please the Sheinbaum administration in Mexico and strengthen their claim to be in lockstep with their US counterparts on security.However, slowing or reducing the movement of pre-cursor chemicals for fentanyl from China to the Americas in any lasting way will take more than the extradition of one man.",

    "body": "5 hours agoJonathan HeadSouth East Asia correspondent, in Kuala LumpurIt was, as everyone knew it would be, all about US President Donald Trump.He literally towered over everyone else at the ceremony in Kuala Lumpur where Cambodia and Thailand signed their agreement. He gave the longest speech - and made the biggest claims.It was all superlatives. \"This is a momentous day for South East Asia,\" Trump said. \"A monumental step.\" Describing the two slightly sheepish-looking prime ministers who were about to sign the deal as \"historic figures\", Trump recalled at length how he got involved in the Thai-Cambodian border conflict while he was visiting his Turnberry golf course in Scotland in July.\"And I said this is much more important than a round of golf... I could have had a lot of fun, but this is much more fun... saving people and saving countries.\"Trump had asked for this special ceremony as a condition for coming to the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit - a gathering US presidents have attended at times in the past, but not always. And he used it to press his campaign to be recognised as a great peacemaker. \"The eight wars that my administration has ended in eight months – there's never been anything like that,\" he said. \"We're averaging one a month... It's like, I shouldn't say it's a hobby, because it's so much more serious, but something I'm good at and something I love to do.\"But what does the \"Kuala Lumpur Peace Accord\", as Trump has renamed it, actually amount to?Remember, both countries signed a ceasefire back in July. That, too, was helped - or at least accelerated - by pressure from Trump. Looking at the details of the latest deal, though, it isn't much of leap forward.The two countries have agreed to withdraw their heavy weapons from the disputed border and to establish an interim observer team to monitor it. They have a new procedure for clearing landmines, and will set up what they call a joint taskforce to address the proliferation of scam centres. They will replace missing border markers with temporary ones.This is progress - and Thai diplomats have told me they do feel Trump's involvement may help these agreements stick. But the historic differences over the border remain unresolved and are at risk of flaring up again.After the ceremony, Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow refused to call it a peace agreement - sticking instead to their own preferred title \"Joint Declaration by the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia on the outcomes of their meeting in Kuala Lumpur\", which doesn't exactly trip off the tongue.\"I would call it a pathway to peace,\" was as far as Sihasak was willing to go - a far cry from Trump's expansive claims for it.\"It's an extremely slight agreement for the president of the United States to be presiding over,\" posted Sebastian Strangio, author and South East Asia Editor for the Diplomat magazine.Cambodia has been a lot more enthusiastic, but then it has always sought to internationalise its dispute with Thailand - referring it to the International Court of Justice - something Thailand does not agree with. At the ceremony, Prime Minister Hun Manet gushed with praise for the US president - reminding him that his government had nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charvirakul was more circumspect - mindful of nationalist pressure back home not to be giving too much away to Cambodia, a problem the authoritarian government in Cambodia does not have to worry about. Thailand has always insisted the dispute should be resolved bilaterally, with no outside mediation. It says it appreciates Trump's support, and describes the US and Malaysia as only \"facilitating\" this agreement.Neither country - nor the rest of Asean - could afford to spurn Trump's request for this ceremony. South East Asia is the most export-dependant region in the world, far more reliant on the US market than China. It has had a difficult year living under the existential threat posed by Trump's initial tariffs - up to 48% - and going through the nail-biting negotiations to bring them down to a more manageable 19-20%. Trump is not even staying for most of the Asean summit. After a couple of bilateral meetings and a dinner, he's off the Japan, and then to a Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) meeting - another multilateral grouping at odds with his brutally transactional style, but where he hopes to reset relations with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.But just having had the US president here in Kuala Lumpur for 24 hours will, Asean hopes, help restore some stability to their relationship.",

    "body": "Venezuela's Maduro says US 'fabricating war' as it deploys world's largest warship14 hours agoKayla Epstein and Josh Cheetham,BBC VerifyThe USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, can carry up to 90 aircraftVenezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has accused the US of \"fabricating a new war\", after it ordered the world's largest warship to be sent to the Caribbean.The USS Gerald R Ford can carry up to 90 aircraft and its deployment marks a massive increase in US firepower in the region.The US has conducted 10 air strikes on vessels in the area as part of what it says is a war on drug traffickers. US President Donald Trump has accused Maduro of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organisation, which he denies, and there are fears in Venezuela that the US military build-up is aimed at removing the long-time opponent of Trump from power. The US is among many nations that do not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader, after the last election in 2024 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair. Opposition tallies from polling stations showed its candidate had won by a landslide.Venezuela plays a relatively minor role in the region's drug trade.What's Trump's endgame in Venezuela?The Pentagon said on Friday that the USS Gerald R Ford carrier would deploy to the US Southern Command area of responsibility, which includes Central America and South America, as well as the Caribbean. The additional forces \"will enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle transnational criminal organisations\", spokesman Sean Parnell said.Maduro accused the US of seeking \"a new eternal war\" in his address.\"They promised they would never again get involved in a war, and they are fabricating a war,\" he told state media.The carrier's deployment would provide the resources to start conducting strikes against targets on the ground. Trump has repeatedly raised the possibility of what he called \"land action\" in Venezuela, saying earlier this week that the US is \"looking at land now\" after getting \"the sea very well under control\".\"We stopped all drugs from coming in by sea. I will stop all drugs from coming in by land very shortly. You'll see that starting,\" he told reporters at the White House on Saturday before departing for a trip to Asia.The US has also bolstered its air presence in the region. BBC Verify has identified a number of US military aircraft across Puerto Rico.It comes as CNN reports Trump is considering targeting cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela, but is yet to make a final decision.Secretary of State Marco Rubio played down the deployment to reporters on his plane flying to Qatar on Saturday, saying: \"We have deployed U.S. assets and interests all over the planet, but when we do it in our own hemisphere...everyone sort of freaks out.\"But he reiterated the Trump administration's view that Venezuela poses a serious threat to the US through the illegal drug trade.\"Unfortunately, the regime that governs, but is not the government of Venezuela, is a transshipment organization,\" he said.  \"They allow cocaine from Colombia and other places to be shipped through national territory – not just with the cooperation, but in many cases, with the participation of elements of this regime.\"Military analysts have pointed out that intercepting drugs at sea does not require a force as big as the current US one.Watch: The US is \"fabricating an eternal war\", says Nicolás MaduroOn Friday, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said \"six male narco-terrorists\" had been killed in an operation in the Caribbean.He said the boat had belonged to the Tren de Aragua - a transnational criminal organisation which has its base in Venezuela and has been proscribed as a terrorist group by the US State Department.The US air strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. \"This is about regime change. They're probably not going to invade, the hope is this is about signalling,\" Dr Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House think tank, told the BBC.He argued the military build-up was intended to \"strike fear\" into the hearts of the Venezuelan military and Maduro's inner circle so that they move against him.Pete Hegseth on XThe US said it had destroyed a drug trafficking boat earlier on FridayThe strike was the latest the Trump administration has carried out against alleged drug traffickers since early September. Most have taken place off the coast of South America, in the Caribbean, but on 21 and 22 October it carried out strikes in the Pacific Ocean as well.At least 43 people have been killed.Members of US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have raised concerns about the legality of the strikes and the president's authority to order them.On 10 September, 25 Democratic senators wrote to the White House, alleging the administration had struck a vessel days earlier \"without evidence that the individuals on the vessel and the vessel's cargo posed a threat to the United States\".Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican, has argued that such strikes require congressional approval. Trump has said he has the legal authority to order the strikes.\"We're allowed to do that, and if we do [it] by land, we may go back to Congress,\" Trump told White House reporters on Wednesday.Brian Finucane, a former US State Department lawyer, told the BBC that the situation amounted to a constitutional crisis that the US Congress, controlled by Republicans, has appeared unwilling to challenge. \"It is the US Congress that has principal control over the use of military force. That control has been usurped in this instance by the White House, and so it's up to Congress to push back,\" said Mr Finucane, who now works at the International Crisis Group.  ",

    "body": "​​Women welcome arrest of charity boss identified in BBC sex-for-aid investigation13 hours agoFundanur Ozturk,BBC News Turkish and Kawoon Khamoosh,BBC World ServiceBBCTurkish charity owner Sadettin Karagoz denies allegations that he sexually assaulted refugees who came to him for aidA Turkish charity owner at the centre of sexual abuse allegations, brought to light by a BBC investigation, has been arrested.BBC News Turkish revealed accusations that Sadettin Karagoz sexually exploited vulnerable women, promising them aid in return for sex. He denies all the allegations.Mr Karagoz set up his charity in Turkey's capital, Ankara, in 2014. Syrian refugees desperate for help said at first he seemed like \"an angel\".One of them, Madina, fled the Syrian civil war in 2016 and said that two years later, one of her children became critically ill and her husband abandoned her. Her name has been changed to protect her anonymity.Left to care for three children alone, she went to Sadettin Karagoz's organisation, which translates as the Hope Charity Store. It gathers donations for refugees such as nappies, pasta, milk and clothes.Mr Karagoz's organisation is based in the Altindag area of Ankara, which is home to thousands of Syrian refugees\"He told me: 'When you have nowhere to go, come to me and I will look after you,\" she says.But when she did, Madina says he changed. She describes how Mr Karagoz told her to go with him to an area in the office behind a curtain to get some supplies.\"He grabbed me,\" she says. \"He started kissing me… I told him to get away from me. If I hadn't yelled, he would have tried to rape me.\"Madina describes how she escaped from the building but Mr Karagoz later went to her home.\"I didn't open the door because I was terrified,\" she says, explaining that he threatened to have her sent back to Syria.Scared of repercussions, Madina says she never went to the police and did not tell anyone else what had happened.Mr Karagoz says his organisation has given vital supplies such as rice, milk and tinned tomato paste to refugees over the past decadeMr Karagoz, a retired bank worker, denies the allegations and has told the BBC that his organisation has helped more than 37,000 people. He says that the aid distribution area in the charity is small, crowded and monitored by CCTV so he could not have been alone with any woman.Over the years, his charity has gained widespread recognition and won a local newspaper award in 2020. It has been featured on national TV, and he says it has attracted support from national and international organisations. In March this year he changed its Turkish name to My Home-meal Association.In all, three women, including Madina, told the BBC that Mr Karagoz had sexually assaulted and harassed them. Seven other people, including two former employees of his charity, say they either witnessed or heard first-hand testimony of him committing acts of sexual abuse between 2016 and 2024.Nada says she went to Mr Karagoz because her family desperately needed supportAccording to 27-year-old Syrian refugee Nada, he said he would only give her aid if she went to an empty flat with him. \"If you don't, I won't give you anything,\" she says Mr Karagoz told her. Again, her name has been changed to protect her anonymity.She was with her sister-in-law and says they stormed out. But desperate to provide for her family, she explains she didn't know where else to turn, so went back.On one occasion, Nada says Mr Karagoz took her behind a curtain to get nappies for her son where \"he tried to touch my breasts\".Another time, she says that \"he came from behind and grabbed my hand… he forced me to touch his genitals\".Afraid of the stigma attached to sexual abuse and scared she would be blamed, Nada says she didn't feel she could tell anyone, even her husband.Batoul says an encounter with Mr Karagoz scared her and that afterwards she isolated herself at home and was afraid to open her door to anyone The third woman who told the BBC that Mr Karagoz had assaulted her is Batoul, who has since moved to Germany.A single mother, she too says she went to him for help. \"When I turned away to pick up the aid, he put his hands on my backside,\" she explains. \"I left the aid and walked out of the shop.\"These testimonies were not the first to surface against Mr Karagoz.In 2019 and 2025 he was accused of sexual harassment and assault, but on both occasions prosecutors decided there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him. Police said neither victims nor witnesses were willing to come forward to make formal complaints.Some women told us they were afraid testifying could lead to them being harassed or deported.But after the BBC investigation, it is understood two other women came forward to report Mr Karagoz, and their testimony resulted in him being charged with sexual abuse. He is now in jail awaiting trial.Batoul says she is \"truly happy\" he has been arrested, \"for myself and for all the women who have suffered in silence and couldn't speak out because of fear\".She adds that she hopes it \"gives courage and strength to all women who are being exploited in any way\".Mr Karagoz says health conditions mean he is not able to engage in sexual activityBefore he was arrested, we put the allegations made by Madina, Nada, Batoul and charity workers to Mr Karagoz.He denied all the accusations and claimed if they were true, more women would have come forward.\"Three people, five people, 10 people [could complain]. Such things occur,\" he said. \"If you said 100, 200 [had accused me], then fine, then you could believe I actually did those things.\"He also said he had diabetes and high blood pressure and showed us a medical report with details of an operation in 2016 to remove his left testicle. This meant he was not able to perform any sexual activity, he said.However a professor of urology and specialist in men's sexual health, Ates Kadioglu, told the BBC that having one testicle removed \"doesn't affect someone's sex life\".We put this to Mr Karagoz who insisted that sexual activity was \"not possible for me\".We also put it to him that sexual assault may be motivated by a desire for power and control. He responded by saying: \"I personally don't have such an urge.\"\"All we did was good deeds and this is what we get in return.\"Sadettin Karagoz said women who accused him of assault in the past did so because he had reported them to the police for being involved in illegal activities.All the women we spoke to denied they or their relatives were involved with crime and the BBC has seen no evidence to suggest that they were.",

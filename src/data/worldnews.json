There is little sign of either side compromising and the next vote to try and end the situation will not be held until Friday.</p></div><div><p>The Senate is currently adjourned, raising fears that the situation could drag on and threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs, as well as risk costing the US economy billions in lost output.</p><p>At a White House briefing on Wednesday afternoon, Vice-President JD Vance made a rare appearance alongside Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt to accuse opposition Democrats of playing political games.</p><p>\"If they are so worried about the effect this is having on the American people, and they should be, what they should do is reopen the government, not complain about how we respond,\" he said.</p><p>Leavitt, meanwhile, indicated that mass job cuts could happen before the end of the week. Pressed by reporters about timeframes, she said \"two days, imminent, very soon\" and promised further updates. </p><p>\"Sometimes you have to do things that you don't want to do,\" Leavitt explained, adding that \"Democrats put us in this position\".</p><p>Trump previously warned that a prolonged shutdown could present him the opportunity to make irreversible cuts to \"Democrat things\". </p><p>He wrote on his Truth Social site on Wednesday evening: \"Republicans must use this opportunity of Democrat forced closure to clear out dead wood, waste, and fraud. Billions of Dollars can be saved.\"</p><p>His administration announced the same day that $18bn (£14bn) would be withheld for infrastructure projects in New York City - the home city of the Democratic leaders in the House and Senate.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdr6pnky7vyo\">Analysis: Four ways this shutdown could end</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdr6pnky7vyo\">Jobs, travel, national parks - what impact will US shutdown have?</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrj1znp0pyo\">Why the US government has shut down and what happens now</a></li></ul><p>Vance's comments represent the latest dig in what has been a bitter blame game between both parties, with the top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer earlier accusing Republicans of trying to \"bully\" them into accepting a funding plan.</p><p>Democrats want to secure guarantees on healthcare funding before they agree to a spending deal, while Republicans want to use a temporary stop-gap measure to keep the government open until mid-November and funded at current levels.</p><p>Schumer and his allies say they allowed the government to shut down in an attempt to negotiate to save healthcare benefits for lower-income Americans. They have said efforts to negotiate with Republicans over these benefits have so far been unsuccessful.</p><p>\"Why are they boycotting negotiations? I've never witnessed this in my life,\" Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said of Republicans. \"The matter is the government will open when Republicans get serious about it talking to Democrats.\"</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Closed parks and empty buildings as US government shuts down</figcaption><p></p><div><p>Meanwhile, Republicans - who control both chambers of Congress but do not have the 60 votes needed to pass a funding bill - have said these healthcare benefits are not the priority, keeping the government open is. </p><p>\"It's not about who wins or who loses or who gets blamed and all this,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said. “It's about the American people. And [Democrats] have taken the American people hostage in a way that they think benefits them politically.\"</p><p>Republicans have also argued the healthcare extensions Democrats are looking for will cost American taxpayers more money and were instituted to manage Covid-era complexities that no longer exist.</p><p>Essential workers such as border agents and the military may be forced to work without pay for the time being - but government employees deemed non-essential are temporarily put on unpaid leave. In the past, these workers have then been paid retrospectively.</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Vance makes rare appearance at White House briefing</figcaption><p></p><div><p>Analysts expect this shutdown to happen on a larger scale than the last one in 2018, when Congress had passed some funding bills. They anticipate that roughly 40% of federal workers - around 750,000 people - to be put on temporary leave.</p><p>Some workers were furloughed on Wednesday. At the White House, Vance reiterated the threat of permanent layoffs of federal workers.</p><p>\"Let's be honest, if this thing drags on, we are going to have to lay people off,\" he said.</p><p>Vance also made the claim - repeatedly denied by Democrats - that the shutdown was a result of senior Democrats advocating for healthcare benefits to be extended to undocumented migrants.</p><p>US law already prohibits undocumented migrants from gaining any federally subsidised healthcare coverage. \"Nowhere have Democrats suggested that we're interested in changing federal law,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said.</p><p>Russell Vought, the White House's budget chief, briefed Republicans behind closed doors on what the impending layoffs could look like, although public details of those plans are sparse. </p><p>On Capitol Hill, there was little appetite for a deal to end the standoff on Wednesday. </p><p>\"There's nothing to negotiate. There's nothing we can pull out of this bill to make it any leaner or cleaner than it is,\" Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said.</p><p>Another vote on the short-term funding bill proposed by Republicans is expected on Friday.</p><p><i>Additional reporting by Bernd Debusmann Jr at the White House</i></p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e941/live/881a7470-9f5f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e941/live/881a7470-9f5f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e941/live/881a7470-9f5f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e941/live/881a7470-9f5f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e941/live/881a7470-9f5f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e941/live/881a7470-9f5f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e941/live/881a7470-9f5f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e941/live/881a7470-9f5f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp\" alt=\"A thin, grey banner promoting the US Politics Unspun newsletter.

Israel has been policing this area but does not have jurisdiction there.</p><p>Israel said its navy told the boats to change course as they were \"approaching an active combat zone and violating a lawful naval blockade\", while the GSF described the interceptions as \"illegal\".</p></div><div><p>The group said Israel's response was \"not an act of defence\", but \"a brazen act of desperation\".</p><p>It estimated 443 people were detained from the boats and alleged that many were assaulted with water cannon. Israel said all those detained were \"safe and in good health\".</p><p>A growing number of countries have expressed concern over the incident, criticising Israel for staging the interception in international waters.</p><p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has expelled all remaining Israeli diplomats from the country in response, and denounced the interception as an \"international crime by [Israel's Prime Minister] Netanyahu\". </p><p>Petro also terminated Colombia's free trade agreement with Israel, in place since 2020, and called for the release of two Colombians who were aboard the flotilla.</p><p>Amnesty International's Secretary General, Agnès Callamard, said Israel's blockade on Gaza was \"unlawful\" and that the \"decades-long impunity for Israel's blatant violations of international law must end\".</p><p>However, Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni criticised the attempt to reach Gaza, saying: \"I continue to believe that all this brings no benefit to the Palestinian people.\"</p><p>Israel's Foreign Ministry posted footage from the interception showing Thunberg sitting on the deck of a boat, being handed water and a jacket by a member of the Israeli military. Detained activists are being taken to the port of Ashdod, Israel said.</p><p>\"Greta and her friends are safe and healthy,\" the Israeli government said.</p><p>Israel has described the flotilla as \"provocation yachts\" and contends that it was justified in stopping the vessels before they entered the naval blockade of the waters that border Gaza.</p><p>It said one boat remained \"at a distance\" and would be intercepted if it approached the blockade.</p><p>That boat appeared to be the Marinette, which the GSF said was still in communication and carrying six people on board. The flotilla's tracking system showed it sailing in international waters a long distance from Gaza's coastline on Thursday afternoon.</p><p>Israel said none of the boats entered the blockade area, though the GSF tracking suggests one of its boats, the Mikeno, may have entered Gaza's territorial waters, but remains out of contact.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9cfe/live/e7cd10e0-9f0e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9cfe/live/e7cd10e0-9f0e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9cfe/live/e7cd10e0-9f0e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9cfe/live/e7cd10e0-9f0e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9cfe/live/e7cd10e0-9f0e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9cfe/live/e7cd10e0-9f0e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9cfe/live/e7cd10e0-9f0e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9cfe/live/e7cd10e0-9f0e-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.png.webp\" alt=\"Israeli foreign ministry Greta Thunberg is detained by the Israeli navy after it intercepted a flotilla heading to Gaza\" /><span>Israeli foreign ministry</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>The Israeli foreign ministry released footage of its forces detaining Swedish activist Greta Thunberg from one of the boats</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>A member of the legal team working with the flotilla has said there will be a further attempt to breach Israel's blockade \"in the coming days\".  </p><p>Caoimhe Butterly, who is aboard a vessel providing legal support and acting as an observer to the GSF, said: \"There is the expectation that it will be up to 13 vessels, ships and boats and that it will follow a similar route to Gaza.\"</p><p>People have gathered in Greece, Italy, Germany, Tunisia and Turkey to protest against Israel's interception of the flotilla.

But all personnel in those roles have to pass the same test.</p><p>\"These standards have always been gender neutral, and they have always been set at a high standard,\" she said. \"Of course, not all women are going to make those, but not all men do either.\"</p><p>This is not the same for the annual physical tests given to all service members, which include routine exercises like push-ups. In those, the standards and scores do differ based on age and gender, and the tests vary by unit.</p><p>Ms Cardnell said it remained unclear if Hegseth would actually bring sweeping changes to how military personnel were assessed. The BBC has asked the Pentagon for clarification on Hegseth's plans.</p></div><div><p>In his speech, Hegseth said: \"Any place where tried-and-true physical standards were altered, especially since 2015, when combat arms standards were changed to ensure females could qualify, must be returned to their original standard.\"</p><p>He appeared to refer to a directive in 2015 by then-Defence Secretary Ash Carter that all military jobs be open to women and that any person, regardless of gender, who meets the standards should be able to serve. </p><p>\"When it comes to any job that requires physical power to perform in combat, those physical standards must be high and gender neutral,\" Hegseth said. \"If women can make it, excellent. If not, it is what it is.\"</p><p>Broadly, Hegseth said he was changing requirements throughout the military to \"fix decades of decay\" and that the armed forces have \"promoted too many uniformed leaders for the wrong reasons,\" like race, gender and \"historic so-called firsts\".</p><p>Senator Tammy Duckworth, an Army veteran who was severely injured while serving as a combat pilot in Iraq, told the BBC after the speech: \"For a guy who's not qualified for his own job, it's pretty discriminatory to talk about women who are qualified to do their jobs.\"</p><p>She added that his remarks could hurt recruitment.</p><p>Women in the US military were first allowed to fly combat aircraft in the Navy and Air Force in 1993, although they were excluded from ground combat. That changed in 2013 when the Combat Exclusion Policy was lifted, and by 2016, combat roles were open to all.</p><p>Because of how recently women were included in all ranks, many are now still in the middle of their careers, according to Ms Cardnell.</p><p>\"It takes time to see those women break that brass ceiling, and we haven't had a chance to see that,\" she said.</p><p>Now active and veteran female soldiers are concerned that Hegseth is building a military culture where women will be undermined and unable to advance, she said.</p><p>\"Leadership sets the tone,\" Ms Cardnell said. </p><p>Elsewhere, Hegseth's comments found support - including from at least one female veteran.</p><p>Republican House Representative Sheri Biggs, who served as a lieutenant colonel in the Air National Guard, said that she supported the defence secretary's efforts to end \"woke\" policies in the military.</p><p>\"Returning to standards that prioritise excellence and accountability puts America's security and our servicemembers where they belong: first,\" Biggs said in a statement to the Associated Press on Tuesday.</p><p>Another Republican representative in South Carolina, Nancy Mace, who graduated from The Citadel military college, posted on X in support of Hegseth. </p><p>\"Our enemies don't fear diversity quotas.

    "body": "<article><div><div><p>20 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Anthony Zurcher</span><span>North America correspondent, Washington</span></p></span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Closed parks and empty buildings as US government shuts down</figcaption><p></p><div><p>Welcome to the shutdown, 2025 edition. On Tuesday evening, the US Senate was unable to pass a spending bill that would have kept the US government funded, and for the first time in nearly seven years, federal operations have been drastically curtailed.</p><p>At some point, this shutdown – like all the ones before it - will end. It may take days; it may take weeks, but eventually, as public pressure and political pain grows, one side or the other will yield.</p><p>Here are four scenarios for how that might play out.</p></div><p></p><h2>Democrats quickly break ranks</h2><p></p><div><p>Senate Democrats shot down a Republican spending bill that would have kept the government operating until November, but that vote may have contained the seeds of their defeat.</p><p>While forty four Democrats (and Republican iconoclast Rand Paul) voted no, two Democrats and one Democrat-allied independent sided with the Republican majority.</p><p>Independent Angus King of Maine is always a bit of a wildcard. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania has been charting his own path for nearly a year. But Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, while not a liberal firebrand, is not your typical political maverick.</p><p>She is, however, up for re-election next year in a state that Donald Trump carried in 2024 and which has been slowly trending Republican for years. </p><p>In her statement explaining her vote, she expressed concern about the economic toll government closure would have on Nevada. She might also be worried about the toll it could take on her political prospects as an incumbent on the ballot when voters turn angry.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/clylje0rmp2t\">Follow the latest development in the US shutdown </a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgj1p485p0no\">Jobs, travel, national parks - what impact will US shutdown have?</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrj1znp0pyo\">Why the US government has shut down and what happens now</a></li></ul><p>She's not the only member of her party from a battleground state who will be on the ballot in 2026, either. Democrats in Georgia, Virginia and Colorado could also start feeling the heat. </p><p>And while incumbents from Minnesota, Michigan and New Hampshire have chosen to retire rather than run for re-election, they might worry that a shutdown puts Democratic control of their seats at risk, too.</p><p>Republican Senate leader John Thune says that he is already hearing from some Democrats who are uneasy with the way the shutdown is playing out. He's planning a series of funding votes in the coming days to keep the pressure on.</p><p>There were no new defections during the vote on Wednesday, but if five more Democrats break ranks, the shutdown will end – whether the rest of the Democratic Party wants it to or not.</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: What could happen during the US government shutdown?</figcaption><p></p><p></p><h2>Democrats back down</h2><p></p><div><p>Even if the Democrats stay (relatively) united, the pressure on them to abandon the fight is likely to increase as the shutdown drags on. </p><p>Government employees are a key constituency in the party, and they will be the ones feeling the pain most immediately from delayed paycheques and the possibility that the Trump administration will use the shutdown to further slash programmes and turn their furloughs into permanent unemployment.</p><p>The American public as a whole will also start feeling the bite through curtailed government services and economic disruption. </p><p>Typically the party that triggers a shutdown and is making the policy demands – in this case, the Democrats - is the one that accrues the public's blame. If that's how this plays out, the party may conclude that they've made as much of a point as they can and cut their losses.</p><p>Even without tangible gains, they may even be able to take comfort in the fact that they have put a spotlight on the expiring health insurance subsidies and Republican-approved government healthcare cuts for the poor that will be kicking in for tens of millions of Americans in the coming months.</p><p>When that blame game starts, such thinking goes, they could be better positioned to reap the political benefits.</p><p>The Democratic base that has been demanding their party dig in and fight the Trump administration won't be fully satisfied, but it's the kind of off-ramp the party leadership might be able to live with.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f297/live/4e1c3b80-9ef3-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f297/live/4e1c3b80-9ef3-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f297/live/4e1c3b80-9ef3-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f297/live/4e1c3b80-9ef3-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f297/live/4e1c3b80-9ef3-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f297/live/4e1c3b80-9ef3-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f297/live/4e1c3b80-9ef3-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f297/live/4e1c3b80-9ef3-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp\" alt=\"EPA Republican leaders of the US House and Senate, including Speaker of the House Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, flank a podium with a sign that reads 'The Democrat Shutdown'. They are outside and the National Mall stretches out behind them. \" /><span>EPA</span></p></div></figure><p></p><h2>Republicans make concessions</h2><p></p><div><p>At the moment, Republicans feel like they are in a position of strength - and are contemplating new ways to increase the pain felt by Democrats. But it is possible that they could be miscalculating, and they end up the ones who back away from the void. </p><p>They've been behind most of the government shutdowns in the past, and the public could hold them responsible this time, too. Maybe it's out of habit or maybe because, in their zeal to slash government services and worker rolls, Republicans overplay their hand.</p><p>In this scenario, the Republicans provide some kind of sufficient guarantee to Democrats that they will help to extend the health-insurance subsidies.</p><p>It's not an entirely unthinkable scenario, given that Republicans are currently divided over whether those subsidies – which help their own low-income voters as well as Democrats – should be continued. That would be a concession that could, in the end, boost their own electoral prospects and defuse an obvious line of Democratic attack in next year's midterm elections.</p><p>Republicans have said they won't negotiate with political hostage-takers, but it is possible to see ground for compromise underneath the overheated rhetoric and acrimony.</p></div><p></p><h2>The shutdown stretches on (and both sides lose)</h2><p></p><div><p>At the moment, of course, overheated rhetoric and acrimony is pretty much all there is. Trump is sharing derisive, obscenity-laced AI generated videos of his opponents. Democrats have responded with Trump-Epstein photos and promises that they are in this fight for the long haul.</p><p>The last government shutdown stretched on for a record-setting 35 days, ending only after US air travel was on the verge of massive disruption. And that was only a partial shutdown, as some government funding had been approved. This time around, the consequences could be more severe.</p><p>If this stretches on long enough, it may not matter who \"wins\" by forcing the other side to fold. There will be more than enough blame to go around.</p><p>In such a \"pox on both houses\" scenario, incumbents from both parties suffer the consequences at the ballot box next year and the public becomes even more dissatisfied with the state of the affairs. That then sets the stage for the next wave of politicians promising to bring a wrecking ball to the status quo.</p><p>Rinse and repeat.</p></div></article>"

This one began on Wednesday, and this deadlock is characterised by partisan disputes over federal spending and Democratic demands to extend healthcare tax credits.</p><p>What makes this shutdown different is the fact that President Donald Trump hopes to use the opportunity to make permanent cuts to government staffing and spending.</p><p>BBC News has been speaking to federal workers about their views and how the shutdown has affected them.</p><p>Although most of the comments below are anonymous, were have verified that the speakers are federal workers. US government staff are generally forbidden from speaking to the media, and we have protected the speakers' identities because they could face disciplinary action if they are named.</p></div><div><p>\"The last shutdown was brutal\", said one federal worker, who highlighted that the impasse in 2018-19 lasted more than a month.</p><p>He added: \"It forced me to withdraw money from my retirement plan just to cover my bills. Now, they've made it more difficult to withdraw from our retirement accounts, so if this goes as long as the last shutdown, I don't know how I'm going to pay my bills.\"</p><p>The same worker said: \"I voted for Trump, but I did not vote for his abuses against us.\"</p><p>Another worker, for the Department of Homeland Security, based in New Jersey, took a slightly different view: \"Despite working without timely pay, I support the shutdown.\" </p><p>He explained: \"The president's circumvention of Congress' power of the purse has been left unchecked by the Supreme Court. Checks and balances must be maintained.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, a worker for Army Corps of Engineers said she was \"rather conflicted\" and did not mind a break from the \"gruelling end of fiscal year - a year full of constantly shifting guidance and the ever-present threat\" of a mass firing.</p><p>She said she would \"support a shutdown if anything productive comes of it, but I'm unsure anything will\".</p><p>Randall from Kansas City, who works with the Aviation Weather Center, said: \"I don't like my pay being held hostage while the government fights over separate issues.\"</p><p>He said he believed that keeping the National Weather Service funded was something both parties typically agreed, so asked why he was \"facing sudden loss of funds because Congress is fighting over healthcare or whatever\". He emphasised that these were his personal views, and not those of his agency.</p><p>An anonymous US Air Force employee told us that if the situation was not resolved, they would have nothing to live on. They expressed his dilemma as follows: \"I must still show up to work but won't get paid, because if I don't it's considered AWOL\".</p><p>A worker at the Department of the Treasury had a message to the party holding out against the spending plans of Trump's Republican party.</p><p>\"I strongly implore Democrats to stand firm and not cave to the continued assault on healthcare and affordability for everyday Americans,\" they said. They added that no amount of threats to her job would cause them to waver in their views.</p></div><p><i>Additional reporting by Kris Bramwell, Mary Litchfield, Alex Akhurst and Imogen James</i></p>"

Help came from China, the European Union and Venezuela, among others.</p><p>In 2017, the UNDP stumped up $25m for Barbuda and the island country of Dominica, which was ravaged by Hurricane Maria that same month.</p><p>The money restored more than 800 wrecked buildings across the two islands. But the body's intervention was crucial in other ways too.</p><p>With livelihoods destroyed, the UNDP's cash-for-work programme hired hundreds of local residents who had suddenly found themselves unemployed.</p><p>They assisted with everything from debris removal to reconstruction of homes and infrastructure, including Barbuda's hospital and post office, the UNDP's Luis Gamarra tells the BBC.</p><p>\"Injecting economic resources into affected families helps reactivate the local economy,\" he says.</p><p>Almost 1,000 contractors were also trained in more resilient \"build back better\" techniques, to safeguard structures against future disasters.</p><p>\"The climate is changing and putting more pressure on governments and communities. Storms are becoming more frequent, more intense and happening earlier in the year too,\" Mr Gamarra continues.</p></div><div><p>He thinks the expansion of partnerships with the private sector and with other countries in the region might help mitigate the impacts.</p><p>One such mechanism is the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility, of which 19 Caribbean governments are members. Set up after Hurricane Ivan in 2004, the first-of-its-kind risk-pooling venture allows member governments to buy disaster coverage at low cost.</p><p>Last year it made record payments topping $85m to Hurricane Beryl-hit islands.</p><p>In Antigua and Barbuda, hurricane preparedness is a year-round endeavour, explains Sherrod James, director of the country's office of disaster services.</p><p>Assessments of buildings to be used as storm shelters, along with training of volunteers to man them, starts months before the season starts, he says.</p><p>\"We also meet with the private sector, helping them put policies and preparations in place, looking at the safety and resilience of their buildings. We make sure our critical partners, such as the ports, are prepared.</p><p>\"And we do a lot of proactive work to address chokepoints within waterways that can exacerbate flooding,\" adds Mr James. \"These days, storms can go from a category one to five in a day. The new norm has thrown out the old regiment of what has to be done; we have to be much more proactive now.\"</p><p>For many Barbudans, this time of year will always bring trepidation. Dwight was among dozens who recently attended a Hurricane Irma remembrance service at the island's Pentecostal Church.</p><p>\"It was very touching and brought back a lot of memories,\" he says. \"This time of year, we keep an eye on the weather and our fingers crossed. But we are resilient people and we know how to survive.\"</p></div></article>"

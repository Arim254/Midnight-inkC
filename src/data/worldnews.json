    "body": "The Spanish town of Terrassa in north-eastern Catalonia has temporarily banned the adoption of black cats from animal shelters to prevent potentially sinister \"rituals\" during Halloween.All requests for the fostering or adoption of the felines will be denied from 6 October to 10 November to protect them from being hurt or used as props, said the local animal welfare service. Deputy Mayor Noel Duque told broadcaster RTVE that adoption requests for black cats usually increase around Halloween.While black cats are often associated with witchcraft and seen as bad luck in Western culture, many other cultures, including Japan and Egypt, see them as symbols of prosperity and fortune.Terassa's city council said there had been no record of cruelty towards black cats in the town, however there have been incidents in other areas and the decision was taken after warnings from animal welfare groups.\"We try to prevent people from adopting because it's trendy or impulsively. And in cases like these, which we know exist, to prevent any macabre practices,\" Duque said.Terrassa is home to more than 9,800 cats, according to local authorities, and the town's adoption centre houses around 100 felines, 12 of which are black, the Catalan News Agency reported.The city council emphasised that the measure is \"temporary and exceptional\" and represents an extra precaution for animal welfare, but did not rule out repeating the ban in the future.Exceptions during the ban period will be assessed individually by the adoption centre and normal fostering requests will resume after Halloween.",

    "body": "Chen Ning Yang, Nobel laureate and one of the world's most influential physicists, has died at the age of 103, according to Chinese state media.An obituary released by CCTV cited illness as the cause of death.Yang and fellow theoretical physicist, Lee Tsung-Dao, were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957 for their work in parity laws, which led to important discoveries regarding elementary particles - the building blocks of matter. Yang was also a professor at Beijing's prestigious Tsinghua University and an honorary dean of the Institute for Advanced Study at the institution.Born in 1922 in China's eastern Anhui province, he was the oldest of five children and raised on the campus of Tsinghua University where his father was a professor of mathematics.As a teenager, Yang told his parents: \"One day, I want to win the Nobel Prize.\"He achieved that dream at the age of 35, when his work with Lee studying the law of parity earned them the honour in 1957.The Nobel committee praised \"their penetrating investigation... which has led to important discoveries regarding the elementary particles\".Yang received his science degree in 1942 from National Southwest Associated University in Kunming, and later completed a master's degree at Tsinghua University.At the end of the Sino-Japanese War, he travelled to the US on a fellowship from Tsinghua and studied at the University of Chicago, where he worked under Italian physicist Enrico Fermi, inventor of the world's first nuclear reactor.Throughout a prolific career, he worked across all areas of physics, but maintained particular interest in the fields of statistical mechanics and symmetry principles.Yang received the Albert Einstein Commemorative Award in 1957 and was also awarded an honorary doctorate by Princeton University in 1958.Yang married his first wife Chih Li Tu in 1950, with whom he had three children.After Tu's death in 2003, Yang married his second wife Weng Fan, who is more than 50 years his junior.The pair had first met in 1995 when Weng was a student in a physics seminar, and later reconnected in 2004. At the time, Yang called her his \"final blessing from God\".",

    "body": "Scientists say seven skeletons found in a mass grave in Croatia were most likely Roman soldiers who lived 1,700 years ago.The male skeletons, all with various injuries, were found \"completely preserved\" during excavations in 2011 at the site of the Roman city of Mursa - modern-day Osijek - in Croatia's far east, a new research paper says.Mursa was conquered by the Romans during the first century BC and became a large settlement that was also an important centre for trade and craft.Now, researchers from several European archaeological institutions have been able to determine not only when the men lived, but also how they may have died.According to the paper, the men in the grave were aged between 36-50 years old, taller-than-average in height, and were \"robust\" individuals. Their diets were mainly vegetarian, but some had also indulged in a little meat and seafood.All showed various healed and un-healed injuries, including those caused by blunt force trauma, and there were puncture wounds on two of their torsos, which the scientists believe were likely caused by arrows or spear tips. All of the men were suffering from some kind of \"pulmonary [affecting the lungs] disease during the final days of their lives\". DNA analysis has also revealed the men had a mix of ancestry and that none appeared to be from the local area. The paper noted that the Roman Empire was a particularly violent era and that Mursa was involved in several conflicts. The researchers believe the men were likely victims of the 'Crisis of the Third Century', most probably the battle of Mursa from 260 CE, when there were \"numerous battles fought between various claimants to the throne\".The paper states that the pit the skeletons were found in would have originally been a water-well - several of which have been discovered in the area. It notes that mass burials and mass graves were \"not a customary way of interring the dead in the Roman Empire\", and were mostly used in extreme situations and mass casualty events.Given the various angles the skeletons now lie, the researchers say they were \"most probably thrown in\" the well before being covered with soil.Mursa has been of archaeological importance for years, with various ancient civilisation sites discovered in the area.",

    "body": "2 hours agoIan AikmanBBCA large crowd gathered for the players' funeral on SaturdayAfghanistan has pulled out of an upcoming cricket series after three players in a local tournament were killed in an air strike it blamed Pakistan for.The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) said it would withdraw from November's tri-nation T20 series out of respect for the dead. The three did not play for the national team.The strike hit a home in Urgon district in Paktika province, where the players were eating dinner after a match, witnesses and local officials told the BBC.Eight people were killed, the ACB said. Pakistan said the strike hit militants and denied targeting civilians. The ACB named the three players who were killed as Kabeer Agha, Sibghatullah and Haroon, calling their deaths \"a great loss for Afghanistan's sports community, its athletes, and the cricketing family\".The International Cricket Council (ICC) said it was \"deeply saddened and appalled\" by the \"tragic deaths of three young and promising Afghan cricketers\" in an air strike that also \"claimed the lives of several civilians\".\"The ICC stands in solidarity with the Afghanistan Cricket Board and echoes their grief,\" it said in a statement, adding that it \"strongly condemns this act of violence\".The attack came hours after a temporary truce between Afghanistan and Pakistan was due to expire following days of deadly clashes on the border between the two nations. Dozens of casualties have been reported.Pakistan said it had targeted Afghan militants in the air strike and that at least 70 combatants had been killed. Pakistan's Minister of Information Attaullah Tarar said claims that the attack targeted civilians are \"false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan\".He rejected the ICC's \"selective, biased and premature comment\", adding it had not cited any \"independent verification to substantiate these claims\". Afghanistan Cricket Board/XThe Afghanistan Cricket Board shared this image of the three players who were killedIn a social media post, Afghan national team captain Rashid Khan paid tribute to the \"aspiring young cricketers who dreamed of representing their nation on the world stage\".Other players for the Afghan national side joined the tributes, including Fazalhaq Farooqi, who said the attack was a \"heinous, unforgivable crime\".On Saturday, large crowds of people were seen gathering at the funeral for the strike's victims.The strike came after Pakistani officials said seven soldiers were killed in a suicide attack near the Afghan border on Friday.The 48-hour truce between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which began on Wednesday at 13:00 GMT, has reportedly been extended to allow for negotiations.An Afghan delegation arrived in the Qatari capital of Doha on Saturday for peace talks with the Pakistani side. The Taliban government said it would take part in the talks despite \"Pakistani aggression\", which it says was Islamabad's attempt to prolong the conflict.Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Pakistan should \"reconsider its policies, and pursue friendly and civilised relations\" with Afghanistan.Pakistan's Foreign Office said on Saturday that Defence Minister Khawaja Asif would lead the country's delegation in Doha.It said the talks will focus on ending cross-border terrorism and restoring peace and stability on the Pakistan-Afghan border.Zimbabwe will now replace Afghanistan in the T20 series.",

    "body": "18 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent  , JerusalemGaza's Hamas-run civil defence says 11 people were killed, all from the same family, after the bus they were in was hit by an Israeli tank shell in northern Gaza.The Abu Shaaban family, it said, were trying to reach their home to inspect it when the incident happened in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City on Friday night.This is the deadliest single incident involving Israeli soldiers in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire eight days ago.The Israeli military said soldiers had fired at a \"suspicious vehicle\" that had crossed the so-called yellow line demarcating the area still occupied by Israeli forces in Gaza.Israeli soldiers continue to operate in more than half of the Gaza Strip, under the terms of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement.Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP news agency the victims were killed while \"trying to check on their home\" in the area.The dead included women and children, according to the civil defence.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said a \"suspicious vehicle was identified crossing the yellow line and approaching IDF troops operating in the northern Gaza Strip\" on Friday, prompting it to fire \"warning shots\" towards the vehicle.It said the vehicle \"continued to approach the troops in a way that caused an imminent threat to them\" and \"troops opened fire to remove the threat, in accordance with the agreement.\"Hamas said the family had been targeted without justification.The IDF has warned Palestinians from entering areas in Gaza still under its control. With limited internet access, many Palestinians do not know the position of Israeli troops as the yellow demarcation line is not physically marked, and it is unclear if the area where the bus was travelling did cross it.The BBC has asked the IDF for coordinates of the incident.Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said on Friday the army would set up visual signs to indicate the location of the line.In a separate development, Hamas on Friday released the body of Israeli hostage Eliyahu Margalit to the Red Cross, which returned it to Israel.Mr Margalit was the tenth deceased hostage to be returned from Gaza. The remains of another 18 people are yet to be repatriated. Israel handed the bodies of 15 more Palestinians over to officials in Gaza via the Red Cross, the Hamas-run health ministry said, bringing the total number of bodies it has received to 135.There has been anger in Israel that Hamas has not returned all of the dead hostages' bodies, in line with last week's ceasefire deal - though the US has downplayed the suggestion it amounts to a breach.The IDF has stressed that Hamas must \"uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages\".Hamas has blamed Israel for making the task difficult because Israeli strikes have reduced so many buildings to rubble and it does not allow heavy machinery and diggers into Gaza to be able to search for the hostages' bodies.As part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Hamas also returned all 20 living hostages to Israel. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 67,900 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.",

Ohtani also became the first pitcher since the Boston Braves' Jim Tobin in 1942 to hit three home runs in the same game.\"It was really fun on both sides of the ball today,\" said Ohtani, who was awarded the Most Valuable Player award for his heroics.\"I'm taking this trophy and let's get four more wins. We won it as a team and this is really a team effort. I hope everybody in LA and Japan and all over the world could enjoy a really good sake [Japanese rice wine].\"Ohtani's entered the game at the Dodger Stadium on the back of an eight-game home run drought, but led from the front as he struck out three batters in the opening frame.He then starred with the bat in a performance which included a crushing 446 foot home run and a monster 469 foot hit which bounced out of the stadium.It marked another historic showing from Ohtani, who last year became the first player ever to record 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in the same season.\"That was probably the greatest post-season performance of all time,\" said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts. \"There's a reason why he's the greatest player on the planet. It's kind of whatever you don't expect, expect him to do it.\"This is just a performance that I've just never seen. No-one's ever seen something like this. I'm still in awe right now of Shohei.\"The Dodgers' comfortable victory sets up a World Series showdown against the Toronto Blue Jays or Seattle Mariners, with the latter 3-2 up in the best-of-seven series.",

    "body": "Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the US of committing \"murder\" following a strike carried out on a boat in Colombian territorial waters in September. In a social media post, Petro accused the US of violating his country's sovereignty and killing a Colombian fisherman.Posting on X, he said: \"The Colombian boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure,\" when it was struck. He added: \"We await explanations from the US government.\"It comes after President Donald Trump said the US had struck a \"drug-carrying submarine\", killing two people.Writing on social media, Trump said two people were killed in the US attack on the  vessel on Thursday, which he said US intelligence confirmed was \"loaded up with mostly Fentanyl, and other illegal narcotics\". The attack is at least the sixth US strike on ships in the Caribbean Sea in recent weeks. It is the first time survivors have been reported.Writing about an earlier attack in September, Pedro wrote on X on Saturday that: \"US government officials have committed a murder and violated our sovereignty in territorial waters.\"Fisherman Alejandro Carranza had no ties to the drug trade and his daily activity was fishing. The Colombian boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure.\"Alejandro Carranza was reportedly killed on September fifteenth when US forces fired on his boat while he was fishing the Caribbean.Trump has defended the ongoing boat attacks, saying they are aimed at stemming the flow of drugs from Latin America into the US, but his government has not provided evidence or details about the identities of the vessels or those on board.UN-appointed human rights experts have described the US strikes as \"extrajudicial executions\".At least 27 people were killed in the prior five boat strikes in the waters off Venezuela, according to figures released by the US administration.Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Friday that the submarine targeted in the latest attack was \"built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs\". \"This was not an innocent group of people. I don't know too many people who have submarines, and that was an attack on a drug-carrying, loaded submarine,\" he said, adding that no US military personnel had been injured. The US president also said two people who survived would be returned to their countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia.They were transferred to a US Navy ship, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. BBC SOUNDS: Why has Trump authorised CIA action in Venezuela?In recent weeks, Trump has ramped up threats against Venezuela's leadership over claims that the country is sending drugs to the US. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused Trump of trying to make the South American nation \"an American colony\".Trump earlier told reporters that he had authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, and that he was considering launching attacks on Venezuelan soil.Narco-subs have become a popular way to transport drugs as they can go largely undetected, and can be sunk after delivery. They are often homemade and constructed using fibreglass and plywood. The US, as well as other coastal nations, have previously intercepted some of these subs.",

It has, however, been re-establishing control - and has had gunfights with a local clan in Gaza - in the power vacuum that followed the Israeli partial withdrawal.The first phase of the ceasefire deal between is currently in progress - all living hostages have been released and bodies of the deceased are still being returned to Israel.Also part of the agreement, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Washington said it had already informed other guarantors of the Gaza peace agreement - which include Egypt, Qatar and Turkey - and demanded Hamas uphold its end of the ceasefire terms. \"Should Hamas proceed with this attack, measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire,\" the statement said.President Donald Trump has previously warned Hamas against the killing of civilians. \"If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social earlier this week.He later clarified that he would not be sending US troops into Gaza.Last week, BBC Verify authenticated graphic videos that showed a public execution carried out by Hamas gunmen in Gaza.The videos showed several men with guns line up eight people, whose arms were tied behind their backs, before killing them in a crowded square.BBC Verify could not confirm the identity of the masked gunmen, though some appeared to be wearing the green headbands associated with Hamas.Israel's military has confirmed that one of two sets of remains handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza on Saturday are those of Ronen Engel. The identity of the second person yet to be announced.So far, the remains of 11 out of 28 deceased hostages had been returned to Israel.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday said the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt would remain closed until Hamas returns the remaining bodies.The Rafah crossing is a vital gateway for Palestinians who need medical assistance to leave Gaza, and for thousands of others to return.Separately on Saturday, 11 members of one Palestinian family were killed by an Israeli tank shell, according to the Hamas-run civil defence ministry, in what was the deadliest single incident involving Israeli soldiers in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire.The Israeli military said soldiers had fired at a \"suspicious vehicle\" that had crossed the so-called yellow line demarcating the area still occupied by Israeli forces in Gaza.There are no physical markers of this line, and it is unclear if the bus did cross it. The BBC has asked the IDF for the coordinates of the incident.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 68,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.In September, a UN commission of inquiry said Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel categorically rejected the report as \"distorted and false\".",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has commuted the sentence of George Santos, a former Republican congressman serving seven years in prison for fraud and identity theft. In a post on social media, Trump said Santos \"has been horribly mistreated\", adding: \"Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life!\"The former lawmaker was only the sixth in US history to be expelled from Congress, after a damning ethics report in 2023. Santos, who admitted to stealing the identities of 11 people, including his own family members, was released on Friday night, US media reported. He served less than three months of a seven-year sentence.\"God bless President Donald J Trump,\" said one of Santos's lawyers, Joseph Murray, following Trump's announcement.In April when Santos was sentenced a judge told him: \"You got elected with your words, most of which were lies.\"He reportedly cried in court and begged for forgiveness, saying: \"I cannot rewrite the past, but I can control the road ahead.\"Prosecutors argued that the novice politician had lied about his background and misused campaign funds to finance his lifestyle.In his post, Trump justified the move by criticising a Democratic lawmaker, Senator Richard Blumenthal, whom he accused of fabricating his US military service. \"This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\" Trump wrote.Trump has previously called for an investigation into Blumenthal over the claim. The Democrat has acknowledged that he misspoke on numerous occasions about his time in the military, but has said the mishaps were more than a decade old. \"This allegation of 15 years ago has been really rejected by the voters of Connecticut three times, overwhelmingly re-electing me,\" Blumenthal told CNN earlier this month. Santos's downfall began in 2022, after the New York Times published an investigation revealing the freshman congressman had lied about his CV, including having a university degree and working for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.From there, the lies continued to pile up, including allegations that he stole money from a fundraiser for a dying dog and that he lied about his mother surviving the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Shortly afterwards, local and federal officials began to investigate.He was eventually charged with 23 federal felony crimes, and in 2023 became the first expelled member of Congress in more than 20 years, and only the sixth in history.A report from the House ethics panel accused him of misusing campaign funds for personal benefits, including Botox and subscriptions on the OnlyFans website.Santos defeated a Democratic incumbent in 2022, flipping the district that encompasses parts of New York's Long Island and Queens, where he grew up.Earlier this week, Santos published an open letter to Trump in the South Shore Press newspaper in Long Island, repeating his plea to be pardoned. The letter, which was titled a \"passionate plea to President Trump\" asked for \"the opportunity to return to my family, my friends, and my community.\"He wrote that he had been kept in solitary confinement after a death threat in August, and apologised for his actions. \"Mr President, I am not asking for sympathy. I am asking for fairness - for the chance to rebuild,\" he wrote.\"I know I have made mistakes in my past. I have faced my share of consequences, and I take full responsibility for my actions. \"But no man, no matter his flaws, deserves to be lost in the system, forgotten and unseen, enduring punishment far beyond what justice requires.\"Santos began serving his sentence in July at a minimum-security jail in New Jersey.Trump has issued pardons to at least two other former Republican lawmakers since returning to office in January.In May, he pardoned former congressman Michael Grimm, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to tax crimes.He also pardoned former Connecticut Governor John Rowland, who pleaded guilty in 2004 to corruption and fraud charges.Commutations do not void criminal convictions, unlike a pardon.",

    "body": "Baek Se-hee, the South Korean author of the bestselling memoir I Want to Die but I Want To Eat Tteokbokki has died at the age of 35.Her 2018 book, a compilation of conversations with her psychiatrist about her depression, was a cultural phenomenon with its themes of mental health resonating with readers across the world.Originally written in Korean, it found international acclaim after its English translation was published in 2022.The details surrounding her death are unclear.Baek donated her organs - her heart, lungs, liver and kidneys - which have helped to save five lives, the Korean Organ Donation Agency said in a statement on Friday.The statement also included comments from her sister, which said that Baek had wanted to \"share her heart with others through her work, and to inspire hope\".I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki, published in 2018, has sold more than a million copies worldwide and been translated in 25 countries.The runaway bestseller was celebrated for normalising mental health conversations and its nuanced take on inner struggles - most notably, the author's personal conflict between depressive thoughts and her appreciation for simple joys.\"The human heart, even when it wants to die, quite often wants at the same time to eat some tteokbokki, too,\" goes the book's most famous line. Tteokbokki, which are tubular chewy rice cakes usually eaten with a spicy sauce or stew, is a popular snack in Korean cuisine.Born in 1990, Baek Se-hee took creative writing in university and worked for five years at a publishing house, according to her short biography on Bloomsbury Publishing, which produced the English version of her 2018 memoir.Anton Hur, who had translated Baek's book into English, wrote on Instagram that her organs have saved five people but \"her readers will know she touched yet millions of lives more with her writing\".\"My thoughts are with her family,\" he wrote.For a decade she received treatment for dysthymia, a mild but long-lasting type of depression, which formed the basis of her bestseller, said her Bloomsbury bio.A sequel, I Want to Die but I Still Want to Eat Tteokbokki, was published in Korean in 2019. Its English translation was published in 2024.Tributes have poured in on social media. \"Rest softly,\" reads a comment on Baek's Instagram page. \"Thank you for saving us with your honesty.\"Another Instagram user said each time they read Baek's memoir they found \"deep comfort in every sentence and grew alongside it\". \"To create a single book that can lift people up... is no easy task, and I have indescribable respect for you for achieving that,\" they wrote.A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line.

    "body": "12 hours agoAna FaguyGetty ImagesAfter serving 43 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, Subramanyam \"Subu\" Vedam was finally free. New evidence had exonerated him earlier this month of the murder of his former roommate.But before he could reach his family's arms, Mr Vedam was taken into custody by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), who want to deport him to India - a country he has not lived in since he was a baby.Now, Mr Vedam's legal team is fighting a deportation order and his family is determined to get him out of custody, for good.His family are now working to navigate a new and \"very different\" situation, his sister Saraswathi Vedam told the BBC. Her brother has gone from a facility where he knew inmates and guards alike, where he mentored fellow inmates, and where he had his own cell, to a facility where he shares a room with 60 men and where his history of good behaviour and mentorship is unknown.Mr Vedam has been repeating one message to his sister and other family members in the wake of the new situation: \"I want us to focus on the win.\"\"My name has been cleared, I'm no longer a prisoner, I'm a detainee.\"The 1980 murderMore than 40 years ago, Mr Vedam was convicted of murdering his once-roommate Tom Kinser, a 19-year-old college student. Kinser's body was found nine months after he went missing in a wooded area with a bullet wound in his skull. On the day of Kinser's disappearance, Mr Vedam had asked him for a ride. While the vehicle Kinser drove was returned to its usual spot, no one saw it being returned. Mr Vedam was charged with Kinser's murder. He was denied bail, had his passport and green card seized by authorities and was labelled a \"foreigner likely to flee\".Two years later he was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1984, he was sentenced to a separate two-and-a-half to five years for a drug offence, as part of a plea agreement. That sentence was to be served simultaneously with his life sentence. Throughout that time, Mr Vedam maintained his innocence on the murder charges. His supporters and family members stressed there was no physical evidence tying him to the crime. Getty ImagesMr Vedam's exoneration Mr Vedam repeatedly appealed the murder conviction and a few years ago new evidence in the case surfaced which exonerated. Earlier this month, Centre County District Attorney Bernie Cantorna said he would not pursue a new trial against Mr Vedam.But Mr Vedam's family knew there was one hurdle left before he was free: he still had a 1988 deportation order, based on his convictions for murder and a drug offence. The family expected they would have to file a motion to have his immigration case reopened, Ms Vedam said. The facts of the case are different now, she stressed.But when they arrested him, ICE cited the immigration order as their reasoning for quickly detaining him in a different Pennsylvania facility. While he was exonerated for the murder charge, his drug conviction still stands, they have said. The immigration agency said it acted on a lawfully issued order.ICE did not respond to the BBC's request for comment, but told other US outlets that Mr Vedam will remain in custody pending his deportation. Mr Vedam's family has said his decades of good behaviour, completion of three degrees and community service while behind bars should be considered when the immigration court examines his case.\"What was deeply disappointing was that we didn't even have a moment to hold him in our arms,\" Ms Vedam said. \"He was held wrongly and one would think that he conducted himself with such honour and purpose and integrity that that should mean something.\"Potential deportation to IndiaThe family has stressed Mr Vedam's ties to India - where ICE has said they would like to deport him to - are weak at best. While he was born there, he moved to the US at nine months old. What relatives are still alive, are distant ones, Ms Vedam told the BBC.His community - Ms Vedam, her four daughters and other cousins - are in the US and Canada. \"He will again be robbed and miss out on the lives of the people closet to him, by being half way across the world,\" she said. \"It's almost like having his life stolen twice.\"Mr Vedam, who is a legal permanent resident, had his citizenship application accepted before he was arrested. Both of his parents were also both US citizens.\"We believe deportation from the United States now, to send him to a country where he has few connections, would represent another terrible wrong done to a man who has already endured a record-setting injustice,\" his lawyer, Ava Benach said in a statement to the BBC.",

    "body": "Israel's military has confirmed that the latest remains handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza and returned to Israel are those of a dead hostage. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the returned hostage is Eliyahu Margalit, 75, who was killed on 7 October and his body taken into Gaza from Nir Oz kibbutz.Mr Margalit, who was known to his family and friends as Churchill, is the 10th dead hostage to be returned from Gaza. The remains of another 18 people have yet to be repatriated. The bodies of 15 Palestinians were handed over by Israel via the Red Cross to officials in Gaza on Saturday, the Hamas-run health ministry said, bringing the total number of bodies it has received to 135.Israel's Hostages and Missing Families Forum described Mr Margalit in a statement as \"a cowboy at heart\" who managed a cattle branch and horse stables at Nir Oz for many years.His death was announced by Israel in December 2023, a month after his daughter Nili - who was also taken hostage - was released during a temporary truce.There has been fury in Israel that Hamas has not returned all of the bodies, in line with last week's ceasefire deal - though the US has downplayed the suggestion it amounts to a breach.On Friday night, the IDF again stressed that Hamas must \"uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages\".Hamas has blamed Israel for making the task difficult because Israeli strikes have reduced so many buildings to rubble and it does not allow heavy machinery and diggers into Gaza to be able to search for the hostages' bodies. UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told the BBC News Channel that the Gaza Strip \"is now a wasteland\", with people picking through the rubble for bodies and trying to find their homes - many of which have been flattened.He added that aid agencies have \"an enormous job ahead of us to stabilise the situation, to stop the starvation, to get the hospitals open, to get the kids back in school\".\"We've started to do that and we're having an impact already but being here on the ground, it's an overwhelming task,\" he said, speaking from Gaza City.BBC Verify - Aid group suspends Gaza operations after ceasefireUS plays down claims Hamas is violating ceasefire dealAs part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.After Hamas said it was unable to retrieve all the bodies, two senior Trump advisers said preparations to move to the next phase of the ceasefire deal were continuing.The advisers told reporters that the US government did not so far believe that Hamas had broken the agreement by not retrieving more remains, and said the group had acted in good faith by sharing information with interlocutors.While the full text of the agreement between Israel and Hamas has not been made public, a leaked version which appeared in Israeli media appeared to allow for the possibility that not all of the bodies would be immediately accessible.Several Palestinians have been reported killed since the ceasefire came into effect. Gaza's Civil Defence, run by Hamas, said on Saturday it had recovered nine bodies all from the same family after a bus was targeted by the IDF in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City, in the north, on Friday. It said 11 people were killed in total. The IDF said a \"suspicious vehicle was identified crossing the yellow line and approaching IDF troops operating in the northern Gaza Strip\" on Friday, prompting it to fire \"warning shots\" towards the vehicle. It said the vehicle \"continued to approach the troops in a way that caused an imminent threat to them\" and \"troops opened fire to remove the threat, in accordance with the agreement\".The IDF has warned Palestinians from entering areas in Gaza still under its control - though the line is not clearly demarcated. The Israeli military continues to operate in more than half of the Gaza Strip, under the terms of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement. Under the next stages of the ceasefire, troops are expected to pull out further. Speaking about his role in brokering the ceasefire, US special envoy Steve Witkoff told CBS News's 60 Minutes programme that President Donald Trump had felt \"like the Israelis were getting a little bit out of control in what they were doing\" after it targeted Hamas leaders in an air strike in Qatar in September. Following the strike in Doha, in which five lower-level Hamas members and a Qatari officer were killed, Witkoff said Trump had felt \"it was time to be very strong and stop them [Israel] from doing things that he felt were not in their long-term interests\".Witkoff, who led the US team at the talks alongside Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, said they had felt \"a little bit betrayed\" by the Israeli move.\"We had lost the confidence of the Qataris. And so Hamas went underground, and it was very, very difficult to get to them,\" Witkoff told the US network.Qatar, a key US ally, has played an important mediating role in ceasefire negotiations between Hamas and Israel.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 67,900 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.",

    "body": "20 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorGAVRIIL GRIGOROV/POOL/AFPPutin flew to Alaska in his specially modified Il-96 plane in AugustThe summit has not been set in stone, but if Russia's Vladimir Putin does go to Budapest to meet US President Trump in the next two weeks, he would need to clear a few hurdles first.When Putin travelled to Alaska for his Anchorage summit in August, the US granted special permission for the presidential plane - a modified Ilyushin Il-96 airliner dubbed the \"Flying Kremlin\" that has four engines and is bristling with defence systems.Russian planes are banned from US airspace, and from EU airspace too. So if Putin does fly to Budapest he would need special dispensation if he decided to fly over an EU member state.It is perfectly possible, but landlocked Hungary is not the easiest destination to get to for a Russian president who rarely sets foot abroad and has not travelled to the EU for years.\"For now, of course, it's not clear,\" says Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. \"What we do have is the willingness of the presidents to hold such a meeting.\"Days after Putin ordered Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the EU froze the assets of both its leader and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.A blanket ban was also imposed on all Russian aircraft flying through the airspace of all 27 EU countries. Hungary and many of its neighbours are Nato member states too.Putin has also been accused by the International Criminal Court (ICC) of war crimes of unlawfully deporting and transferring of Ukrainian children to Russia.So there are complications, although Hungary believes they can all be sorted out. Hungary is in the process of pulling out of the ICC anyway.Putin and Hungary's Viktor Orban, probably his closest ally in the EU, have already discussed the planned summit over the phone, and Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has told reporters \"we will of course ensure that he can enter Hungary, hold successful talks here, and then return home\".Getty ImagesHungary's Viktor Orban is one of Putin's closest allies in the EUThe EU is unlikely to create obstacles either.Its executive commission has said any meeting that moves forward \"a just and lasting peace for Ukraine\" is welcome and it supports President Trump's efforts towards that.One of the main drivers for its latest proposed sanctions on Russia - the 19th package so far - is to bring the Russians to the negotiating table, it says. And it points out there's no travel ban on Putin, only an asset freeze.The biggest sticking point is how Russia's leader will fly from Moscow to Budapest. Clearly he will not be buying an Air Serbia ticket to Belgrade and catching the train to Hungary, which may be the most direct route to take.He will want his Il-96 plane to guarantee his safety, but that will probably mean using the airspace of an EU and Nato member state and obtaining permission to break the EU's ban on Russian planes.European Commission spokeswoman Anitta Hipper said on Friday that \"in terms of the direction of travel, member states can give derogations but it must be given by member states individually\".Nato has also referred the issue to respective national authorities, and as Trump is involved they may acquiesce.Even with dispensation, a look at the map shows Putin may have to take a circuitous route. Ukraine is out of the question, and probably Poland too because of Warsaw's icy relations with Moscow.Perhaps the most direct route goes via the eastern coast of the Black Sea and Turkey, through Bulgaria and either Serbia or Romania into Hungary.Serbia's president, Aleksandar Vucic, knows Putin well and Air Serbia has direct flights to Moscow over EU airspace. Serbia is a candidate to join the EU but is not a member.It is the EU countries, Bulgaria or perhaps Romania, that would need to give consent, and they would have to escort Putin's plane through their airspace.Romania has what is set to become the biggest Nato base in Europe, and Bulgaria is also building a Nato base as part of efforts to shore up the defensive alliance's eastern flank.A spokesperson in Bucharest told the BBC the issues were only subjects of speculation at the moment and that \"Romania has not received a request for overflight from the Russian Federation to date\".The BBC has also approached Bulgaria‘s foreign ministry for comment.If Putin wants to play it even more safely, he could fly via Turkey, around the south coast of Greece and then up through Montenegrin airspace before going over Serbia. But it is a far longer route.Anadolu via Getty ImagesPutin's Ilyushin plane has been dubbed the \"Flying Kremlin\"Budapest is not then the easiest of venues, even if it works very well for Viktor Orban, who has long had good relations with both Putin and Donald Trump.\"It's a leader that we like,\" said Trump on Friday, \"he likes him, I like him.\"A high-profile international summit will do Orban no harm at all, as he is trailing in the polls before elections next spring.Within hours of Budapest being named as a venue, Orban was on the phone to Putin and declared on his Facebook page: \"Preparations are in full swing!\"Orban has little time for the EU's backing of Ukraine and he was quick to make clear Brussels would have nothing to do with the talks.\"Since the EU is pro-war, it is logical that it will be left out of this peace process,\" he told Hungarian radio on Friday.European leaders will have other ideas when they see him at next week's summit in Brussels next week.",

    "body": "2 days agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent in WarsawOmar Marques/Getty ImagesVolodymyr Zhuravlyov was released after the judge delivered his verdictA Polish judge has refused to extradite a Ukrainian citizen – suspected by Germany of sabotaging the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September 2022 – arguing that if Ukraine was responsible for the attack, then it was a \"just\" act.Volodymyr Zhuravlyov, who was brought to Warsaw District Court in handcuffs, was detained in Poland last month on a European arrest warrant.Judge Dariusz Lubowski ordered his release, after a ruling that was met with a ripple of surprise from the crowd in court and a smile from the man in the dock.Mr Zhuravlyov, along with others, is suspected of planting explosives deep beneath the Baltic Sea on the pipelines leading from Russia to Germany.Blame for the blasts, which crippled a long-controversial energy supply line from Russia to Germany, initially focused on Moscow until signs of Ukrainian involvement began to emerge. Officials in Kyiv have repeatedly denied any role.Extradition cases within the EU are usually quick and straightforward, but the Nord Stream case is proving to be very different.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, whose government is a key ally of war-torn Ukraine, immediately posted on X that the ruling was right. \"Case closed,\" he wrote.Diver held in Poland over Russian pipeline blasts in Baltic SeaUkrainian held in Italy over Nord Stream gas pipelines blast mysteryInside the giant district courthouse in Warsaw, Judge Lubowski announced his decision to the suspect, his family and legal team – and a large cluster of TV cameras.In a long and passionate speech, he said he was considering only the request to send Mr Zhuravlyov to Germany, not the substance of the case itself. But he was clear that the context of the war in Ukraine was critical.The judge described Russia's invasion as \"a bloody and genocidal attack\" and argued, quoting Aristotle and Saint Thomas Aquinas, that Ukraine had the legal right to defend itself.\"If Ukraine and its special forces… organised an armed mission to destroy enemy pipelines – which the court does not prejudge – then these actions were not unlawful. \"On the contrary, they were justified, rational and just,\" he told the court.BBC/Sarah RainsfordMr Zhuravlyov's wife, Yulianna, said it was important to hear the judge understood UkrainiansHe said the attack had \"deprived the enemy of billions of euros paid by Germany for the gas… and weakened Russia's military potential\".What could be seen as terrorism or sabotage in peace time, the judge said, was different in a time of war.Germany had in fact halted use of the two Nord Stream 1 pipelines after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Nord Stream 2 had not yet entered service.Poland has always been a vocal critic of that project for making Berlin too dependent on Moscow. The route deprived Poland of transit fees for the gas. Ukraine and the US were also longstanding opponents of the pipelines.Judge Lubowski insisted, though, that his ruling was a legal one, and not emotional or political. He also questioned whether Germany had jurisdiction even to bring its case, as the explosions were in international waters on pipelines with majority Russian state ownership.Announcing that Mr Zhuravlyov would be released from custody, he said the Ukrainian would also get compensation from the Polish state.\"I am happy… it was a really very hard three weeks,\" Mr Zhuravlyov's wife, Yulianna, told the BBC in court after the judge's verdict.\"For me, as a Ukrainian, it was very important to hear that he understands us.\"She said the family planned to stay in Poland, where they have lived since February 2022.Earlier, she described her husband's arrest at their home just outside Warsaw and said he denied any involvement in the sabotage.Volodymyr Zhuravlyov is a deep-sea diver, his wife has confirmed, but she called it a hobby and said he had no military role. He has a business in Poland installing air conditioners. Mrs Zhuravlyova could not tell the BBC exactly where her husband was when three of the four Nord Stream pipelines were blown up, because she said no-one had asked her to check.He is not the only suspect on Germany's list: another Ukrainian man was detained in Italy in August when he was on holiday. Serhiy Kuznetsov was also accused of \"unconstitutional sabotage\" and has denied any connection to the blasts. He is currently in a high security prison in northern Italy.A court in Bologna did rule he should be extradited to Berlin but earlier this week that verdict was annulled by the top appeals court in Rome and the case has been returned to Bologna to begin all over again.Asked about the decision, Germany's foreign minister said he respected the ruling and it was not the job of government to interfere with the courts.",

    "body": "Buying more, wearing less - why India's Diwali gold rush is different1 day agoAnahita SachdevDelhi andNikhil InamdarMumbaiGetty ImagesMore Indians are choosing buying gold for investment purposes this festive seasonAhead of the Hindu festival of Diwali, the jewellery market in Indian capital Delhi's vibrant Lajpat Nagar neighbourhood is teeming with crowds.Shops have stayed open even on holidays, and at dusk, dozens of cars line up the streets as a string of flashy signboards beckon shoppers into the flower-adorned stores.Soaring gold prices - which have topped $1,440 (£1,081) for 10g - may have slightly dented demand for jewellery in the world's second largest market for the yellow metal this year, but Indians are not willing to entirely give up on their penchant for gold yet.Diwali, along with Dhanteras -  a smaller festival that falls on Saturday this year - are believed to be auspicious occasions to buy precious metal, with hundreds of thousands of Indians flocking the markets to buy gold and silver coins, bars and jewellery, which they believe bring wealth and luck.Skyrocketing prices have created FOMO - or the fear of missing out - in the minds of buyers, who are worried prices might rise even further, Prakash Pahlajani, who runs Kumar Jewels, a family-owned business, told the BBC on a busy evening at his shop.\"As a result, I have more customers this year,\" Mr Pahlajani said.But with prices - gold is up 60% and silver 70% - shooting through the roof, jewellers are having to change tack to counter stagnant customer budgets.\"People are not saying 'I don't want to buy'. Instead, they are saying, 'I'll buy a little less,\" said Tanishq Gupta, another jeweller down the road from Mr Pahlajani's shop. He said he's had to be innovative and design pieces that look elaborate but have a reduced quantity of gold in them. A coin made of 250mg gold, which he sells for as low as $35, is now thinner but made to look as big as the heavier ones.Coins weighing a tenth of that, at 25mg, are also on offer in the market.Pushpinder Chauhan, another retailer in the area, said higher prices had also exacerbated the growing preference for lighter jewellery this year, \"especially among younger buyers\" who want pieces for everyday wear and not just special occasions.Retailers are selling gold coins weighing as low as 250mg to keep the demand goingSeveral jewellers the BBC spoke to pointed to another clear trend - more customers were buying gold and silver for investment rather than jewellery this year, something that is also reflected in bullion market data.While gold jewellery continues to account for the largest share of India's overall gold demand, the proportion driven by investment - primarily bars and coins - has been rising steadily, according to the World Gold Council (WGC).\"Jewellery's share declined to 64% in the second quarter of this year, from 80% in the same period in 2023, while investment demand increased from 19% to 35% over the same period,\" Kavita Chacko, the council's research head, told the BBC.A lot of that demand is also being fed by investment in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or digital gold, where September marked record high inflows.ETF assets under management have surged by over 70% this year.Besides retail demand, gold prices are also being significantly influenced by India's central bank, with the metal's share in its foreign exchange reserves rising from 9% to 14% in 2025, according to WGC.In fact, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been \"a major pillar of global gold demand over the past three years\", said Kaynat Chainwala who tracks commodities at Kotak Securities, a broking house.She said the RBI has been stocking up on gold in a bid to diversify its foreign exchange holdings, reduce its dependence on the dollar and provide stability during geopolitical stress.Those in the business say there's a clear shift in demand from heavier to lighter jewelleryGoing forward, with the festive and the wedding season under way, retail demand for gold and silver is expected to continue to hold up despite record-high prices, say experts.\"The affluent classes will continue to buy, though it is a setback for lower income families,\" said Madan Sabnavis, the chief economist at the state-run Bank of Baroda. \"Demand will hold up in value terms, even though volumes will fall.\"But some families have been totally priced out of the market. \"I am now having to think a lot while buying - about whether to even get something,\" Bhavna, who's getting married in February, told the BBC outside Mr Pahlajani's jewellery store.For the moment, she's held off her purchases and is waiting for prices to fall a bit so that she can come back to finish her wedding shopping. NurPhoto via Getty ImagesMany Hindus purchase gold and silver during Diwali for good luck and prosperity Such strong cultural affinity for physical gold, particularly jewellery, means the appetite for the noble metal is unlikely to be dented in the long term, despite the short-term moderation, say experts.This is especially true for a country where high gold holdings have given solid long-term returns, making many Indians affluent at a time when growth is stumbling and jobs are hard to come by.According to the US investment bank Morgan Stanley, Indian households held a staggering $3.8tn of gold, equivalent to 88.8% of the country's GDP.\"This implies a positive wealth effect on the household balance sheet, given the uptrend in gold prices,\" Economists Upasana Chachra and Bani Gambhir wrote in a recent note, adding that Indian families are also benefitting from \"cyclical factors of lower interest payments with monetary policy easing, and the positive impact on disposable income through direct and indirect tax cuts\".That's not a bad start to the festive season, even though record prices may have taken some glitter off the precious metal.

The jury saw graphic videos of Combs' so-called \"freak offs\" - sex parties he had filmed featuring hired male escorts and his ex Cassandra Ventura and \"Jane\", an anonymous victim. They also saw a video, that had previously gone viral, of him beating Ventura in a hotel hallway.</p><p>In July, a panel of 12 New Yorkers acquitted Combs, 55, of sex trafficking and racketeering charges - which carried the potential of life in prison - but found him guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qz32wzeego\">What has Sean 'Diddy' Combs been convicted of?</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y8zgey6lgo\">'I lost my way' - Diddy begs judge for leniency on eve of sentencing</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80g93ryklno\">How much time could Diddy spend in prison?</a></li></ul></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Sean 'Diddy' Combs' family, attorneys arrive for his sentencing</figcaption><p></p><div><p>His attorneys hoped he would be out of prison in a matter of weeks, asking the court for a sentence of 14 months, 13 of which he had already served.</p><p>Prosecutors had accused Combs of running a criminal enterprise to coerce women into unwanted and drug-fuelled sex acts. Although he had been acquitted of those most serious of those charges, sex-trafficking and racketeering, they had asked for a sentence of over 11 years in prison.</p><p>Ultimately, Judge Subramanian told a downcast Combs that his crimes and abuse of his ex-girlfriends warranted 50 months in prison.</p><p>As he told the court that Combs had used his fame and power to \"subjugate\" his victims, the music mogul did not look up, remaining expressionless for the judge's 20-minute speech. His entourage of over 30 family members were packed in the courtroom behind him.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4789/live/aab63f00-a09f-11f0-acb8-f5a76ee1c581.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4789/live/aab63f00-a09f-11f0-acb8-f5a76ee1c581.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4789/live/aab63f00-a09f-11f0-acb8-f5a76ee1c581.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4789/live/aab63f00-a09f-11f0-acb8-f5a76ee1c581.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4789/live/aab63f00-a09f-11f0-acb8-f5a76ee1c581.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4789/live/aab63f00-a09f-11f0-acb8-f5a76ee1c581.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4789/live/aab63f00-a09f-11f0-acb8-f5a76ee1c581.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4789/live/aab63f00-a09f-11f0-acb8-f5a76ee1c581.jpg.webp\" alt=\"REUTERS/Jane Rosenberg Court sketch shows Sean \"Diddy\" Combs becomes emotional as his children as babies are shown on a screen during a court sentencing\" /><span>REUTERS/Jane Rosenberg</span></p></div></figure><div><p>During the all-day hearing, the court listened to hours of speeches from several of his attorneys, his children, a pastor and a criminal justice reform advocate who told the court that Combs was a changed and sober man since detention.</p><p>They also watched a video compilation from his legal team showing him with his children as well as the funeral of his former girlfriend Kim Porter, the mother of some of his children who died in 2018.</p><p>But the court did not hear from the victims themselves, after one person who planned to speak, Mia, a former assistant of Combs who testified anonymously, pulled out after the defence wrote a letter calling her a liar.</p><p>Subramanian called the letter \"inappropriate\", and thanked the \"strong women\" for coming forward with the allegations against Combs, telling them they weren't \"just speaking to 12 men and women in the jury box\".</p><p>In lieu of their own statements on Friday, Subramanian read several of the victims' remarks from testimony, telling Combs: \"These were serious offences that irreparably harmed two women.\"</p><p>Combs himself addressed the court for the first time since the beginning of his trial.</p><p>Breathing a large sigh before standing to read his speech, he pleaded with the judge for \"mercy\".</p></div><div><p>He read with glasses from a piece of paper in front of him, trying to maintain eye contact with the judge as he told him: \"I have nobody to blame but myself.\"</p><p>He broke into tears as he turned around to face his family and tell his mother: \"I failed you as a son.\"</p><p>It was not the first time tears were shed during the hearing.</p><p>Many of Combs' supporters cried as six of his seven children came to the podium to ask the judge for a light sentence, telling him they needed their father.

The rest are in the process of being deported. Israel is keen to end this procedure as quickly as possible.\"</p><p>It added that all detainees were safe and in good health. The GSF has alleged that many activists were assaulted with water cannon while their boats were intercepted. </p><p>The foreign ministry's statement mentioned the presence of Swedish activist Greta Thunberg on one of the boats, but did not give further details on her status.</p><p>In a statement on Friday morning, the GSF said: \"Over 38 hours, Israeli occupation naval forces illegally intercepted all 42 of our vessels—each carrying humanitarian aid, volunteers, and the determination to break Israel's illegal siege on Gaza.\" </p><p>It said the last of its boats, the Marinette, was illegally intercepted at 10:29 local time on Friday, approximately 42.5 nautical miles from Gaza in international waters.</p><p>\"Live streams and communications have been cut, and the status of participants and crew remains unconfirmed,\" the GSF said.</p><p>\"This is an illegal attack on unarmed humanitarians. We call on governments and international institutions to demand their immediate safety and release,\" it added.</p><p>In a livestream from the Marinette, one passenger was seen holding up a piece of paper to the camera reading \"We see a ship!\" just before 10:00 local time (8:00 BST).</p><p>About half an hour later, a dinghy full of armed troops wearing tactical gear pulled alongside the Marinette, with a much larger military vessel visible in the background.</p><p>The latest data on the Marinette, via the flotilla's tracking website, put it 43 nautical miles (80km) from the Gaza coast at 10:07 - shortly before it was boarded.</p><p>The majority of the vessels sailing as part of the flotilla are not visible on ship tracking sites reviewed by BBC Verify.</p><p>Five of the vessels intercepted on Thursday are now moored at the Israeli Ashdod Naval Base, tracking website Marine Traffic showed on Friday morning.</p><p>The BBC has asked the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) whether it plans to return the vessels to their owners and how long those detained will be held.</p><p>The GSF flotilla set sail for Gaza from Spain at the end of last month, with other boats joining from Tunisia and other ports later, the GSF said. </p><p>Protests in support of the flotilla and against the war in Gaza ramped up around the world as the boats neared the Strip, in countries including Spain, Italy, Colombia and Argentina.</p><p><i>Additional reporting by Matt Murphy and Richard Irvine-Brown</i></p></div>",

Six had served at the British Army Training Unit in Kenya (Batuk) and one worked as a contractor.</p><p>It's the first time paternity has been proved in this way in a UK court.</p><p>The decision opens the door for the offspring to apply for British citizenship. </p></div><div><p>They were represented by British lawyer James Netto, who - together with leading geneticist Denise Syndercombe Court – had taken part in a project to collect DNA samples and testimonies from people in the Nanyuki region of Kenya.</p><p>They encountered many people there who believed their fathers had served at nearby Batuk, the biggest British army base in Africa.</p><p>Publicly available DNA databases were then used to try to locate any family members in the UK.</p><p>One of the claimants, Peter Wambugu, told the BBC that he grew up knowing that his father was a British soldier, but said they had never met. The 33-year-old chef said he was bullied throughout his childhood for being mixed-race.</p><p>Peter said his mother told him that his father \"was a good man\". He added: \"She told me he said he will be back one day, but he never came.\"</p><p>He has since been reunited with his father, who claimed he had no idea he had a son.  After their first meeting, Peter told the BBC: \"So all the pain that I've been carrying all these 30 years, all the discrimination I get from people, that pain has come out as joy.\"</p><p>Another claimant who cannot be identified for legal reasons, said she met her father once at the age of four and then never again. She said that growing up without him was tough and that she \"felt extremely abandoned\".</p></div><div><p>Reacting to the ruling, James Netto said: \"For many families, today's hearing marks the end of an incredibly difficult journey that for so long felt impossible. Children and young people who previously only had questions, now have answers.\"</p><p>He said there were many more people near Batuk in a similar situation, and the next step was to tackle more difficult cases – those who had little or no information about their fathers or family members.</p><p>Andrew Macleod – a lawyer and campaigner involved in the DNA project – said he hoped that today's case would encourage the Ministry of Defence to take on more responsibility for paternity claims made against Batuk servicemen.</p><p>The Ministry of Defence told the BBC that \"while paternity claims against UK Service Personnel are a private life issue, the government cooperates with local child support authorities where there are claims relating to paternity\".</p><p>The BBC has been following this story over the last year as part of an upcoming five-part World of Secrets podcast.</p></div>",

The national energy watchdog and Spanish lawmakers are also conducting separate investigations.</p><p>The Spanish government believes the Entso-e report supports its own findings.</p><p>Sara Aagesen, minister for ecological transition, said it was \"completely in line\" with the results of an investigation it commissioned which concluded in June that both the national grid provider Red Eléctrica and private electricity companies were at fault.</p><p>Both Red Eléctrica and the private firms have insisted that they were not to blame. Redeia, owner of Red Eléctrica, has blamed the blackout on some coal, gas and nuclear power plants' failure to help maintain appropriate voltage.</p><p>Spanish utilities said it was caused by poor planning from grid operators.</p><p>The Entso-e report also said some important data was missing and that \"collecting complete, high-quality data proved very challenging for this investigation\".</p><p>A final report, to be published in the first quarter of next year, will investigate the root causes of the overvoltage and the actions employed to control voltage in the system.</p></div><div><p>The outage triggered a broader debate that spilled into the political arena about Spain's energy model.</p><p>The opposition suggested an increasingly heavy reliance on renewable energy, promoted by the left-wing government of Pedro Sánchez, could have been a factor in causing the blackout and the country's decreasing supply of nuclear energy meant a dependable back-up was not available.</p><p>The government roundly rejected these theories and the new report was careful to avoid taking sides when it came to the causes of April's unprecedented blackout.</p><p>The loss of power forced Madrid Open Tennis organisers to stop a match half way through play. </p><p>Spain's nuclear power plants automatically stopped when the blackout hit, and the Spanish oil company Moeve said it halted operations at its oil refineries.</p><p>Buildings <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c175ykvjxyeo\">were plunged into darkness</a>, while mobile phones and traffic lights stopped working. Queues snaked around street corners and card payments failed, forcing people to queue for cash and cram on to buses as other transport systems were not running. </p><p>Emergency workers were called to 286 buildings to free people trapped inside elevators in the Madrid region and hospitals implemented emergency plans, halting routine procedures. </p></div>",

These are similar powers to those applied to al-Qaeda after 9/11.</p><p>Trump has not provided the reasoning for why he appears to be categorising drug trafficking and associated crimes as an \"armed attack\", or named which cartels he believes are attacking the US.</p><p>He has already designed many cartels, including in Mexico, Ecuador and Venezuela, as terrorist organisations – granting US authorities more powers in their response to them.</p></div>",

She randomly spotted a newspaper advertisement by the Indian railways, looking for assistant train drivers, and grabbed the opportunity. </p><p>At the time, she wasn't aware that there were no female train operators in the country. She simply saw the job as a means to earn an income.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c945/live/3d1de220-9e7b-11f0-87ed-35a1f1a2157d.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c945/live/3d1de220-9e7b-11f0-87ed-35a1f1a2157d.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c945/live/3d1de220-9e7b-11f0-87ed-35a1f1a2157d.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c945/live/3d1de220-9e7b-11f0-87ed-35a1f1a2157d.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c945/live/3d1de220-9e7b-11f0-87ed-35a1f1a2157d.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c945/live/3d1de220-9e7b-11f0-87ed-35a1f1a2157d.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c945/live/3d1de220-9e7b-11f0-87ed-35a1f1a2157d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c945/live/3d1de220-9e7b-11f0-87ed-35a1f1a2157d.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Central Railway/Twitter An old photo of Surekha Yadav in a beige Indian dress in the train's control room.\" /><span>Central Railway/Twitter</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>An old photo of Surekha Yadav in the train's control room</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Government jobs are highly coveted in India because of the security and perks they offer.

While she didn't expect many female students, she was taken aback when she saw there wasn't a single girl in her class. </p><p>\"I wondered what to do.

They have to be alert at all times and make quick decisions to prevent accidents and ensure passenger safety. </p><p>Thousands of trains criss-cross India's sprawling railway network each day, ferrying millions of passengers to their destinations. India's trains are often called the lifeline of the country because of the expanse of their network and how affordable they are. </p><p>Ms Yadav says she learnt the art of interpreting cues, anticipating problems and reacting in real time to avert crises.</p><p>In 1996, she was promoted to the post of locomotive pilot - the main operator of the train's control room, or the \"nerve centre\" of the train.</p><p>The unpredictable work hours, due to unforeseen delays and accidents, was one of the toughest challenges of the job. </p><p>Come rain or shine, she had to show up for duty. Unpredictable meal times and lack of washroom facilities or changing rooms for women on some trains added to the challenges. </p><p>Ms Yadav says she has operated trains on flooded tracks, across mountain passes and on multiple-day journeys.</p><p>She worked through two pregnancies and raised her children while continuing to work. </p><p>The nature of her job, she says, didn't allow her to miss her children when she had to be away from them.</p><p>\"You have to watch the signal, the track, the overhead equipment, listen to your colleague, and keep your eyes on the speed - all at the same time. How could I think of my children?\" Ms Yadav says. \"If your mind drifts for even 30 seconds, even a microsecond, it can be dangerous for everyone on the train.\"</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4e71/live/51d364c0-9f6f-11f0-9bc3-493c32f03408.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4e71/live/51d364c0-9f6f-11f0-9bc3-493c32f03408.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4e71/live/51d364c0-9f6f-11f0-9bc3-493c32f03408.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4e71/live/51d364c0-9f6f-11f0-9bc3-493c32f03408.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4e71/live/51d364c0-9f6f-11f0-9bc3-493c32f03408.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4e71/live/51d364c0-9f6f-11f0-9bc3-493c32f03408.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4e71/live/51d364c0-9f6f-11f0-9bc3-493c32f03408.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4e71/live/51d364c0-9f6f-11f0-9bc3-493c32f03408.jpg.webp\" alt=\"BBC Marathi A lady dressed in a sari applies red powder of Ms Yadav's forehead as she exits a train in Mumbai, India.\" /><span>BBC Marathi</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Ms Yadav was given a grand farewell by her colleagues</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>She recalls having to miss several family celebrations and outings because of her job.

Women and children are suffering, and she needs to work for peace and reconciliation.\"</p><p>That places Bishop Onyango at odds with the archbishop of her country, who is part of Gafcon's leadership.</p><p>When I asked the Archbishop of Rwanda whether this moment could prove to be an irreparable rupture in the worldwide Anglican Communion, he texted me that \"nothing is irreparable with God, but it requires repentance.</p><p>\"Gafcon has always called for erring church leaders to repent and return to the Bible's teaching. But until they do so, we cannot walk with them in their apostasy.\"</p></div>",

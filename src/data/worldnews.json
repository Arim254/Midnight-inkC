    "body": "President Vladimir Putin has doubled down on his core demands for ending the war in Ukraine, stating that Russia will lay down arms only if Kyiv's troops withdraw from territory claimed by Moscow.Putin has long pushed for legal recognition of the Ukrainian territories Russia has seized by force.They include the Crimean peninsula, which it illegally annexed in 2014, and the Donbas, made up of Luhansk and Donetsk, which Moscow now occupies for the most part.For Kyiv, which has ruled out relinquishing the parts of the Donbas it still holds, rewarding Russia for its aggression is a non-starter.Speaking to reporters during a trip to Kyrgyzstan, Putin accused Kyiv of wanting to fight \"to the last Ukrainian\" - which he said Russia was \"in principle\" also ready to do. He repeated his view that Russia has the initiative on the battlefield and the fighting would only end when Ukrainian troops withdrew from the embattled territories.\"If they don't withdraw, we'll achieve this by force of arms,\" he said.Yet Russia's slow gains in eastern Ukraine have come at significant cost of manpower. According to the US-based Institute for the Study of War, at this rate it would take Moscow almost two more years to seize the rest of the Donetsk region. Thursday's remarks were the first time that Putin addressed the hectic diplomatic moves of the last week, which saw the US and Ukraine hold intense discussions over a peace plan reportedly drafted in October by American and Russian officials.The plan, which was heavily slanted towards Moscow's demands, was subsequently revised. However, it is thought it does not address the issue of the occupied territories which - alongside security guarantees for Ukraine - is the biggest sticking point between Moscow and Kyiv.Putin said that new draft plan has now been shown to Russia, and that it could become the \"basis\" for a future agreement to end the war.However, he added it was \"absolutely necessary\" to discuss \"certain specific points that need to be put in diplomatic language\".Asked about the possibility of Crimea and the Donbas being recognised as under Russian de facto control but not legally, Putin said: \"This is the point of our discussion with our American counterparts\".A US delegation including special envoy Steve Witkoff was expected in Moscow in the first half of next week, he confirmed. US President Donald Trump told reporters that Witkoff may be joined in Moscow by the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner.Meanwhile, Ukraine's top presidential aide Andriy Yermak said that US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll is due to visit Kyiv later in the week.On Wednesday Trump said there were \"only a few remaining points of disagreement\" between Russia and Ukraine – indicating that any meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss these points was contingent on a peace deal being agreed upon.During his comments to reporters Putin again expressed his contempt for the Ukrainian leadership, which he said he considered illegitimate. There was therefore \"no use\" signing any documents with them, he added.Ukraine has been under martial law since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 and has therefore been unable to hold scheduled elections. Earlier this year, the Ukrainian parliament voted unanimously to affirm the legitimacy of President Zelensky, whose term in office ended in the spring. Putin also dismissed warnings by European leaders that Russia could attack the European continent within the next decades.\"That sounds laughable to us, really,\" he said.The White House and Donald Trump have sounded optimistic about the recent diplomatic push for peace talks, but Europeans have repeatedly expressed their scepticism over whether Putin truly intended to end the war. On Wednesday European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen accused Russia of upholding a post-World War Two mindset and of seeing the European continent as a \"sphere of influence\" in which sovereign nations could be \"carved up\".",

    "body": "Police in Malawi are investigating how four police dogs went missing from a presidential palace in the capital, Lilongwe, during the political transition in September.Godfrey Arthur Jalale, who served as State House deputy chief of staff under former President Lazarus Chakwera, has been arrested in connection with the theft of the four German Shepherds. He denies the charge. Chakwera vacated the palace after losing the elections to President Peter Mutharika. Late on Wednesday, police denied reports that Chakwera had been arrested but confirmed securing a search warrant for his residence after information suggested the stolen dogs were being kept there.Chakwera, who came second with 33% of the vote in the September election, is facing numerous allegations of public resources mismanagement, especially during the handover.His Malawi Congress Party (MCP) has accused Mutharika's administration of  \"harassing and intimidating\" the former leader. Chakwera has not commented.Local media have reported the theft of state property from two presidential residences - the Kamuzu Palace in Lilongwe, and Sanjika Palace, in Blantyre, the country's second biggest city.The four dogs, valued at $2,300 (£1,700), were taken out of the palace between 19 September and 4 October, according to the state prosecutors. In a statement on Wednesday, police said they had \"intensified investigations following reports of property looting\" from Kamuzu Palace.  \"The Malawi Police Service assures the public that the investigation is progressing smoothly,\" it added. MCP MPs boycotted parliamentary sessions on Wednesday and camped out at Chakwera's residence in Lilongwe amid reports that he faced arrest following a heightened police presence, local media reported.Chakwera, a pastor before entering politics, accepted defeat and has kept a low profile since the election. He made his first public appearance last week when he announced that he had accepted a Commonwealth appointment to help mediate in Tanzania's post-election unrest. Mutharika, who first served as president between 2014 and 2020, campaigned on a pledge of a \"return to proven leadership\" - which resonated with Malawian voters. He returned to power in a country that is in deep crisis, with a severe shortage of fuel and foreign currency.The former law professor was rarely seen in public during the campaign, in contrast to Chakwera who held numerous rallies across Malawi.As a result, speculation about Mutharika's health is rife and there are questions about whether he has the stamina to lead Malawi again at the age of 85.",

    "body": "Pope Leo on first foreign trip says future of humanity at stake from conflict5 hours agoAleem MaqboolReligion editor, travelling with Pope Leo XIVAnadolu via Getty ImagesPope Leo (C) was welcomed to Ankara by Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip ErdoganPope Leo XIV has warned that the world should not give into \"a heightened level of conflict on the global level\", at the start of his foreign trip in Turkey.\"The future of humanity is at stake, said the Pope, urging President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to act as a source of stability because of the need to promote dialogue and stability.The Pope will mark a historic Christian anniversary during his visit to Turkey, before heading to Lebanon days after Israeli airstrikes on its capital, Beirut.The visits had been planned by late Pope Francis, but their main theme of building bridges was embraced by Pope Leo from the moment he stepped on the balcony of St Peter's Basilica after his election in May.Leo warned that today's wars were like a \"third world war fought piecemeal\", repeating a phrase that his predecessor had himself used several times, referring to conflicts in Ukraine, Syria, Myanmar and elsewhere. Since he became pontiff six months ago, he has conveyed a sense of being extremely measured, even cautious. But on this trip, his powers of diplomacy will be closely scrutinised.A key moment of the trip will take place in the Turkish town of Iznik, the site of the ancient city of Nicaea. Pope Leo and leaders of other Christian traditions will gather to mark the anniversary of an ancient council that took place there 1,700 years ago.  In 325 AD, among other key decisions, more than 200 bishops at the council affirmed the belief that Jesus was the son of God, eventually leading to what is known as the Nicene Creed.Eastern and Western branches of Christianity later dramatically split, but during this trip there will be messages of togetherness and healing divisions.In Turkey the Pope will also visit the Blue Mosque, as both his immediate predecessors Pope Francis and Pope Benedict XVI had done. He will have meetings with other religious leaders in a gesture of inter-religious dialogue before flying on to the second leg of the trip.EPAThe Pope plans to visit the Blue Mosque in IstanbulThe Vatican says plans for the Pope's visit to Lebanon have not changed following the Israeli airstrikes on Beirut earlier in the week.He will meet more faith leaders and hear from young people in Lebanon, his visit giving a boost in particular to the estimated third of the country that is Christian.On the final day of the trip, Pope Leo will celebrate Mass at the Beirut waterfront at the site of the 2020 port explosion, praying for the more than 200 people who were killed and 7,000 others injured.Over recent months, though he has spoken out on some issues dear to him such as the dignity of migrants, he has certainly not been as overtly political as his predecessor could be.He has walked such a fine line that in some cases both progressives and traditionalists within the Catholic Church have made the case that he supports their school of thought.It was for similar reasons that cardinals of different persuasions were thought to have coalesced around him at conclave.Pope Francis was seen as a visionary but one who was not overly worried about creating consensus, leaving behind a somewhat divided Church. Pope Leo has so far operated very differently, gently holding on to some of the progressive ideals of his predecessor while paying heed to the views of traditionalists.He has repeatedly called for an end to war, but in a different way to Pope Francis, who memorably made daily calls to the Holy Family Church in Gaza to offer his support.ReutersThe Pope met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the Presidential Palace in Ankara on ThursdayIn meetings on this trip - with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Lebanese civic leaders - Pope Leo may be drawn to comment on his views on conflict in the region.We may hear something of his impressions at the end of his trip, as it is customary for the Pope to hold a news conference with travelling press on the return flight to Rome.What we will hear more of on this trip is a pope speaking in a Chicagoan accent. Although Pope Leo, who speaks several languages fluently, has mainly given public addresses in Italian up to this point, the Vatican has confirmed that he will speak English throughout the Turkish leg of his trip, with some French too during his time in Lebanon.",

    "body": "South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has described as \"regrettable\" the announcement by US President Donald Trump that South Africa would not be invited to take part in next year's G20 summit in Florida.In a social media post, Trump said South Africa had refused to hand over the G20 presidency to a US embassy representative at last week's summit in Johannesburg.\"Therefore, at my direction, South Africa will NOT be receiving an invitation to the 2026 G20, which will be hosted in the Great City of Miami, Florida next year.\"Members of the G20 – a gathering of the world's biggest economies - do not need an invite but can possibly be barred through visa restrictions.South Africa's presidential spokesman Vincent Magwenya said they \"should by now accept\" at the highest level of political leadership that \"there won't be a reset of the relationship\" between the two countries despite the efforts they had undertaken.\"If visas are denied, well, then we will have to move on and look beyond the G20 in the US,\" he told the BBC, in response to a question on how they would proceed.He said they were focused on working with other G20 members to carry the momentum of the issues deliberated at the summit in Johannesburg.Trump boycotted the summit because of a widely discredited claim that South Africa's white minority is the victim of large-scale killings and land grabs.Ramaphosa said in a statement that the US had been expected to participate in the G20 meetings, \"but unfortunately, it elected not to attend the G20 Leaders Summit in Johannesburg out of its own volition\". He however noted that some US businesses and civil society entities were present.He said that since the US delegation was not there, \"instruments of the G20 Presidency were duly handed over to a US Embassy official at the Headquarters of South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation\".The low-key handover appears to have further angered Trump, who has been critical of the South African government's domestic and foreign policies.He has in the past claimed that a white genocide was taking place in South Africa, and on Wednesday he said the government was \"killing white people and randomly allowing their farms to be taken from them\".The South African government has consistently rejected such claims as widely discredited and lacking reliable evidence.Ramaphosa said it was regrettable that despite efforts to reset relations with the US, Trump continued \"to apply punitive measures against South Africa based on misinformation and distortions about our country\".In the Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump said South Africa had \"demonstrated to the world they were not a country worthy of membership anywhere\" and announced a stop to \"all payments and subsidies to them, effective immediately\".South African officials have called for solidarity and urged other G20 members to defend the integrity of the gathering and the rights of all its member states.The G20 summit, which was for the first time held in Africa, ended with a joint declaration committing to \"multilateral co-operation\" on climate change mitigation and economic inequality.The declaration was adopted despite objections from the US, which has accused South Africa of weaponising its leadership of the group this year.Additional reporting by Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg",

    "body": "France to bring in form of military service, 25 years after conscription was phased out8 hours agoHugh SchofieldIn ParisShutterstockPresident Macron said the new form of voluntary service was an \"act of trust in our youth\"A limited form of military service will be re-introduced in France in response to growing fears of a confrontation with Russia.More than 25 years after conscription was phased out, the plan will see young men and women volunteering for a paid 10 months of military training.\"The only way to avoid danger is to prepare for it,\" President Emmanuel Macron said while announcing the plan at an infantry base near Grenoble in south-east France. \"We need to mobilise, mobilising the nation to defend itself, to be ready and remain respected.\" The new \"national service\" will be brought in gradually from next summer, mainly for 18- and 19-year-olds, who will receive at least €800 (£700) a month.\"In this uncertain world where might triumphs over right, war is in the present tense,\" said Macron. The armed forces would benefit from motivated young French men and women, he added: \"It is an act of trust in our youth.\"Initially, numbers will be restricted to 3,000 next year, but this should rise to 50,000 by 2035.France currently has around 200,000 military personnel and a further 47,000 reservists. The new scheme should usher in a three-tier structure, comprising professionals, reservists and volunteers.The change brings France in line with other European countries that have launched military service schemes - with varying parameters - because of fears of Russian aggression.Belgium and the Netherlands have introduced a voluntary military service, and Germany is planning something similar.Only this month, the Belgian defence ministry sent letters to 17-year-olds inviting them to volunteer for about €2,000 (£1,750) a month.Further east, Lithuania and Latvia have compulsory schemes, with cadets chosen by lottery. Sweden, which recently joined Nato, has started a nine- to 15-month military service with selection on merit.Some European countries, like Finland and Greece, have never stopped military service, while the Swiss are to vote on Sunday on replacing mandatory service for men with compulsory civic duty for all.Others countries, including the UK and Spain, currently have no plans to re-introduce it.AFP via Getty ImagesFrance began phasing out conscription in the late 1990sFrench military chiefs are broadly in favour of the new measure, which they hope will create a reservoir of trained personnel able to back up professional soldiers and replace them in non-frontline tasks.  It is also hoped many volunteers will stay on to lead full military careers.\"The new military service moves us in the direction of hybridisation of the armed forces,\" Thomas Gassilloud, president of the National Assembly's defence committee, said. \"We went too far in the direction of the all-professional.\"The threat of a looming, if ill-defined, stand-off with Russia has become part of France's national discourse. The government has regularly raised the alert over below-the-radar incidents or attempts by Moscow to poison opinion via social media.Recently, the newly appointed chief-of-staff, Gen Fabien Mandon, took the alarm to a new level when he said French military planning was built around the assumption of a confrontation with Russia in the next three or four years.ReutersGen Fabien Mandon prompted an outcry when he said French opinion had to be prepared for \"losing children\" at warHe went further last week, telling a gathering of mayors that what France lacked was the spirit of sacrifice, urging them to prepare opinion for the possibility of \"losing children\" in war.Immediately condemned by the far-left and part of the far-right, the remarks were also seen as unhelpful by the government, with Macron reassuring the country last weekend that there were no plans to send young recruits to fight in Ukraine.Polls show a large majority of the public in favour of voluntary military service. An Elabe survey this week found that 73% supported the measure. Young people – aged 25-34 – were the least supportive, but even in this age group there was a 60% majority.In a random BBC test of opinion on Paris streets, a similar picture emerged.\"It's a good thing,\" said Louis, a 22-year-old student. \"It can help make the army bigger, but it's also a way to love your nation more.\"Eilan, another student, said: \"In military service you meet people from everywhere. You learn new ways of seeing things... You learn to talk and trust and co-exist with other people.\"\"From what I read in the newspapers, our army is not that powerful - so if we have to prepare for the future, maybe it's a good idea,\" said set-designer Brigitte.But Lalie, a 21-year-old shop assistant, disagreed: \"I think there are more important issues. It's a pity the president is not really interested in young people – their mental health, their financial situation, and instead is focusing on this military service.\"It was in 1996 that then-President Jacques Chirac took the decision to end military service, as part of the peace dividend from the fall of the Soviet Union.Compulsory military training for young men had been part of national life since the French Revolution, which created the idea of the citizen-soldier.A 1798 law setting up conscription read: \"Every Frenchman is a soldier and is bound to the defence of the homeland.\" And after defeat by Prussia in 1871, Republican leader Léon Gambetta said: \"When in France a citizen is born, he is born a soldier.\"The Algerian war of independence was the last conflict fought by French conscripts, with more than 12,000 killed.By the 1990s, service had been reduced to 10 months, with options for civilian work instead.Since the last conscript passed out in 2001 there have been various, nebulous attempts to retain something of the spirit of military service, which proponents said fostered a sense of cohesion and equality.Lycée (high-school) students still have to attend a Day of Defence and Citizenship, where they are given lectures on rights and duties, and attend a flag-raising ceremony.In his first term, Macron also established a Universal National Service – a four-week course in civic responsibilities and practical training – which was supposed to build national solidarity following the terrorist attacks of the 2010s. But the scheme was panned as an expensive and ill-attended form of holiday camp, and was dropped earlier this year.Though this new scheme appears to enjoy a broadly favourable reception, there are still questions over its funding – with a debt crisis looming over the country and parliament still unable to approve a 2026 budget.",

    "body": "1 day agoHafsa KhalilWatch: Trump says Witkoff doing \"standard negotiation\" in talks with RussiaDonald Trump has defended his special envoy Steve Witkoff as doing the \"standard thing\" after a leaked recording appeared to show him advising a Russian official on how to appeal to the US president.Trump told reporters on Wednesday that he had not heard the audio, but that Witkoff was doing \"what a dealmaker does\" to \"sell\" a US-authored peace plan to both Russia and Ukraine.The leaked call from last month emerged days after the 28-point draft peace plan was presented by the US, which largely reflected Russian positions on ending its full-scale war in Ukraine.Witkoff has visited Moscow several times this year and will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin again next week.He has never gone to Kyiv in his role as special envoy, though other US officials have visited and US army secretary Dan Driscoll went to Kyiv this week. Trump says he will hold further talks with the Ukrainians.Diplomatic talks have continued after the initial draft plan was criticised by Ukrainian and European leaders as being too favourable to Russia. Among the proposals was handing Russia territory in eastern Ukraine currently controlled by Kyiv. The plan has since been revised to better reflect Ukraine's interests and the views of European allies. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he was ready to meet Trump to discuss outstanding \"sensitive points\".In the leaked audio recording obtained and shared as a transcript by Bloomberg, Witkoff appeared to advise Yuri Ushakov, Putin's foreign policy adviser, on how to get on Trump's good side.BBC News has not independently verified the reported 14 October call, but Trump said it represented a \"very standard form of negotiations\". During the leaked conversation, the two men reportedly talked about ending the war, with Ushakov asking if it would be useful to get their bosses - Putin and Trump - to speak.Witkoff is quoted as saying that \"my guy is ready to do it\", before suggesting how to go about the call.\"Just reiterate that you congratulate the president [Trump] on this achievement... that you respect that he is a man of peace and you're just, you're really glad to have seen it happen,\" Witkoff is quoted as saying. \"I think from that it's going to be a really good call.\"\"I told the president that you - that the Russian Federation has always wanted a peace deal. That's my belief,\" Witkoff adds, according to the transcript. \"The issue is is that we have two nations that are having a hard time coming to a compromise.\"He continues: \"I'm even thinking that maybe we set out like a 20-point peace proposal, just like we did in Gaza.\"The call ends with Witkoff telling Ushakov of an imminent Zelensky visit to the White House, and that \"if possible\", Trump and Putin should talk before that meeting.What followed was a two-and-a-half hour phone call between the US and Russian presidents, news of which emerged as Zelensky was on his way to Washington last month.Before the Trump-Putin call, the US president had appeared to be running out of patience with his Russian counterpart and had suggested he might provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles.By the time Zelensky entered the White House, the atmosphere seemed to have changed. Trump said giving Kyiv Tomahawks could escalate the conflict and that he believed Putin \"wants to end the war\".Asked about the call being leaked, Yuri Ushakov told Russian state media that it was done to \"hinder, probably\" and that it was \"unlikely\" to be done to improve relations.He also confirmed that Witkoff would be visiting Moscow next week as per a \"preliminary agreement\".It was not clear who was behind the leak, but Bloomberg has also transcribed another reported call between Ushakov and Putin envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who spent days with Witkoff in Miami in late October weeks before the 28-point draft plan emerged.According to that transcript, Dmitriev tells his Russian colleague: \"We'll just make this paper from our position, and I'll informally pass it along, making it clear that it's all informal. And let them do like their own.\"Apparently angered by the report, Dmitriev complained of a \"well-funded, well-organised malicious media machine built to spread fake narratives, smear opponents and keep people confused\".",

    "body": "US transportation secretary wants more civility in air travel. Not everyone is on boardUS Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is urging air travellers to dress better and be more civil - and it's touching a nerve at a time when many Americans consider air travel more frustrating than ever. Ahead of what's expected to be the busiest Thanksgiving travel season in 15 years, Duffy launched a campaign last week titled \"The Golden Age of Travel Starts with You\", in which he harked back to the 1950s and 60s to call for a return to civility and class in air travel. But as air traffic controllers remain short-staffed and customers face frequent flight delays, both social media users and aviation experts say Duffy is missing the point. A video advert for the Department of Transportation's campaign juxtaposes old footage of smiling airport staff and orderly passengers with modern social media videos of people starting fights on planes, putting their bare feet up on seats and engaging in other disruptive behaviour. \"Manners don't stop at the gate. Things aren't what they used to be,\" Duffy chimes in. \"Let's bring civility and manners back. Ask yourself, are you helping a pregnant woman put her bag in the overhead bin? Are you dressing with respect?\"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) predicts this week will be the busiest Thanksgiving travel season in 15 years - with more than 52,000 flights on 25 November alone. And aviation experts say Duffy's message won't have much effect on the flying atmosphere. Scott Keyes, an air travel expert and founder of the flight deals site Going.com, told the BBC that, while it sounds great to ask everyone to just be nicer to each other, in terms of the actual efficacy of that message, \"you might as well ask a wall to start printing you money\". \"Very few people show up for their flight itching to pick a fight with another passenger,\" Mr Keyes said. And once they reach the level of agitation where they've started picking a fight with a flight attendant or passenger, he said they're unlikely to remember Duffy's words or calm down. The underlying problem, he argues, is people letting their tempers get the best of them, which he sees as a worsening problem across all of society, not just on airplanes, and not just in the US. Since the secretary started posting about the campaign on X, some of his subsequent posts have been flooded with thousands of comments critical of Duffy's message.\"If you want us to be respectful humans at the airport stop treating us like cattle,\" one X user commented. \"Remove the demoralising and humiliating TSA checks (that accomplish nothing) and find a way to get the airlines to give more than 2 inches of space per seat.\"Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and president of Atmosphere Research Group, told the BBC that, while Duffy makes a valid point that being considerate was important, his call to dress nicer won't change a thing. \"You could be dressed in black tie and still be a jerk, and you could be wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt and be the most considerate person in the world. The clothes, in this case, do not make the person,\" Mr Harteveldt said. A number of commenters on Duffy's X post have pointed out that the reason they dress so casually is because of how cramped plane cabins have become, as well as the expectation of extended delays. \"Tell you what,\" one X user commented. \"You get the planes running on time, and we won't dress to spend the night in the damn airport.\" Another wrote: \"Can I get my legroom back?\"One X user, who has nearly 500,000 followers, posted: \"Duffy is absolutely right...BUT our declining travel dress is also a reflection of how airlines treat us. Cattle boarding, tiny seats, penny pinching every beverage cost and just generally miserable.\" Echoing what many social media users have pointed out, Mr Harteveldt said the airlines bore some responsibility for passengers' bad behaviour, too, by making their \"economy cabins so unpleasant and so physically uncomfortable\" that they naturally put passengers in a bad mood. Couple that with minimal flight attendant staffing, minimal amenities on board, and the airlines' embrace of the pay-for-what-you-want business model, \"you don't get people smiling as they walk down the loading bridge to the plane,\" he said. Still, others have praised the secretary's core message of respect and kindness, with one commenting: \"I will do my small part to spread civility in my own life.\"The Department of Transportation (DOT) says the campaign isn't only about saying \"please\" and \"thank you\" - it's also about reducing the amount of violent and disruptive incidents on airplanes and in airports. The agency says that since 2019 there's been a 400% increase in in-flight outbursts, including both unruly behaviour and violent attacks. Since 2021, the department has recorded 13,800 unruly passenger incidents, while one in five attendants have experienced a physical incident.But experts dispute that air travel has declined in quality. Dan Bubb, an aviation historian and professor at University of Nevada Las Vegas, told the BBC that, despite the rise in incivility cases, statistically that number wasn't very significant. There are far more travellers and flights now than there used to be, and Prof Bubb said that makes it difficult to compare today's airline incidents with past decades. Mr Keyes pointed out what he sees as another major issue with Duffy's message: air travel used to bring a host of other issues we no longer face today. \"It's laughable how much worse air travel was back then,\" Mr Keyes said. Flying was far less safe, he said, noting that planes crashed and were hijacked more frequently. Flights were also far more expensive relative to income. Among other drawbacks: the cabins were filled with cigarette smoke, and flight attendants faced rampant sexism and stringent physical requirements. Mr Keyes believes the FAA and DOT could make more of a difference in reducing passenger stress by pushing airlines to minimise the number of delays and cancellations. Prof Bubb said it would also help to \"give passengers a little more physical space in terms of seat size and legroom, include meal service in the price of their tickets, reduce alcohol consumption, make going through security at airports less stressful, make parking at airports easier, expand boarding area space at airport gates\". And, he added, we do still need to encourage passengers to be courteous to flight crews and each other.",

    "body": "20 hours agoKennedy GondweLusakaAFP via Getty ImagesHakainde Hichilema says that his government's investments will take time to bear fruitZambia's President Hakainde Hichilema has come out fighting after a bruising month that saw him come under attack by stone throwers as he was trying to make a speech.Video clips of him crouching and then being whisked away from a rally in the Copperbelt province shocked Zambians and many people, irrespective of their political affiliation, condemned what happened.But with nine months to go until elections and a run for a second term, the president is under pressure.On Tuesday, in his first press conference for 18 months, Hichilema set out to defend his record and laid out his achievements on the key issues of the economy and power generation.\"This level of hatred is shocking, you can see and even touch the venom,\" he said, while appealing for Zambians to love each other.But the message may not hit home with those who are continuing to struggle day to day.The president has lost touch with \"the real pulse of the people\", according to an opposition candidate to be mayor of the capital, Lusaka, Simon Mwila, who was trying to explain why people were throwing stones \"rather than flowers\".Sishuwa Sishuwa, a Zambian historian and senior lecturer at South Africa's Stellenbosch University, argues that the president has turned his back on what he once stood for.\"In power and over the last four years, Hichilema has turned out to be nearly everything he detested about his predecessor, Edgar Lungu, and, in some cases, much worse,\" the academic told the BBC.This is a charge rejected by the president, who pointed out his record on solving the debt crisis that he inherited and stabilising government finances.On 8 November, Hichilema may have hoped for a friendlier reception in Chingola town, particularly as he had arrived with $450,000 (£340,000) to go towards rebuilding a local market that had been destroyed in a fire.Instead, an angry crowd forced him to abandon his address.Police blamed the trouble on \"unruly members of the public\" who were allegedly looting local shops. At least 27 people have been arrested for violence and arson.At his press conference this week, Hichilema accused illegal artisanal miners of being behind the violence as his government was trying to crack down on this unregistered work.\"We will not allow any thuggery to return ever again,\" he said.XA grainy video captured the moment that President Hakainde Hichilema (crouching behind the microphone) came under attackIn the 2021 elections, Hichilema, who had already made five unsuccessful runs for the presidency, surfed a wave of popularity that swept him into power in a landslide victory over Lungu.By polling day, the country had defaulted on its debts, annual price inflation was touching 25% and there were frequent power blackouts.Under the slogan \"Bally will fix it\" (\"bally\" is Zambian slang for father), he positioned himself as the solution to virtually all the problems the country faced.Debt repayments have since been renegotiated and inflation has come down.This week, Hichilema said that whereas four years ago there was a \"huge debt mountain\" and \"we were living beyond our means\", now Zambia's credit rating had improved and it was attracting investment from all over the world.He also argued that the country's vital mining sector was rebounding.But with the August 2026 election approaching, Hichilema is finding out that he is not necessarily thanked for what he has achieved but rather criticised for what has not changed.Economist Trevor Hambayi has described the progress with the nation's finances as an \"overriding success story\".Better budgetary controls have helped boost investment in infrastructure, education, social programmes, health and the recruitment of essential government workers.Annual inflation has come down to just below 12%, and the currency, the kwacha, has recently strengthened following a precipitous decline in the early years of the Hichilema presidency.But Mr Hambayi told the BBC that the failure to resolve the power crisis had had a big impact on people, along with the \"high cost of living and the lack of employment opportunities\".\"These are the metrics that speak to the ordinary Zambian.\"In its October report, the Lusaka-based Jesuit Centre for Theological Reflection, which monitors the cost of living, said people were being squeezed by high prices for essential food and non-food items that \"continue to absorb a growing share of household income\".It added that although inflation had eased, \"many families still cannot meet basic needs without reducing food quality or skipping meals\".The president did acknowledge the energy problem in September, saying that the government feels \"the pain and frustration of power outages faced by our citizens\".Getty ImagesPower shortages are making the lives of ordinary people very hardAnd this week he said Zambia's generation capacity had been \"decapitated\" by a recent drought owing to its reliance on hydroelectricity.\"This challenge was a wake-up call. Now we have woken up,\" he added, promising more solar and thermal energy projects.Throughout his 15 years in opposition, Hichilema portrayed himself as an upholder of democratic values.But once in state house, he has been accused of passing oppressive measures which he had previously opposed, such as the Cybersecurity Law.This legislation, while seen as necessary for dealing with things like online fraud and child pornography, has been criticised for allowing the surveillance of anyone the state sees as undesirable.Academic Dr Sishuwa also accused Hichilema of using the law against his opponents - exactly what he had criticised under the previous administration.\"After he commendably abolished the law on defamation of the president, he quickly turned to other repressive statutes to arrest critics and political opponents on a variety of charges such as sedition, criminal libel, hate speech, espionage and unlawful assembly,\" he said.The president insists that his government respects the rule of law and has not targeted anyone for political reasons.Hichilema has also backed a controversial constitutional review process, including a plan to increase the number of constituencies so there would be more MPs in parliament.While in opposition, he successfully campaigned against a review that incorporated a similar idea, saying this would enable then-President Lungu to stay in power and that it was too close to elections to embark on such a huge change.He now argues that, according to the constitution, Zambia needs to create new constituencies every 10 years.The president says that the delimitation exercise, or the increase in the number of constituencies, is important to ensure that resources are distributed equally.And he has hit out at critics who are planning to hold national prayers to protest against the process on Friday, saying there is already a consultation process and discussions at state house, as well as legal avenues to object.With the clock ticking down towards next year's election, the president appears concerned about the way that people are responding to him.While calling for tempers to cool, Hichilema has urged patience, saying it takes time for long-term development and investment programmes to have an impact.But as the volley of stones thrown his way attests, patience may be wearing thin for some.More about Zambia from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "France's highest court has upheld a sentence against former French President Nicolas Sarkozy over the illegal financing of his 2012 re-election campaign.He was found guilty of overspending on his campaign, then hiring a PR firm named Bygmalion to cover it up.Sarkozy, 70, was handed the one-year sentence in 2024 of which six months were suspended, meaning they could be served by wearing an electronic tag instead of going to jail.He has always denied all allegations. Prosecutors in the case said Sarkozy's UMP party spent nearly double the €22.5m (£19.4m) cap on his campaign, splurging on lavish campaign rallies and events.To hide the costs, UMP then asked Bygmalion to invoice the party, rather than the campaign.Today's is the second definitive conviction for the former president, who was in power from 2007 to 2012.Last December the High Court of Appeal upheld a corruption conviction and Sarkozy had to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet for six months.Then, in September, he was sentenced to five years in jail after being found guilty of criminal conspiracy.He spent 20 days in jail before he was released earlier in November. An appeal trial will be held next year. Until then Sarkozy will be subject to strict judicial supervision and barred from leaving France.Days after his release, Sarkozy's team announced the former president was writing a book about his three weeks in jail, titled \"A prisoner's diary\". An excerpt from the book was published on social media: \"In prison there is nothing to see, and nothing to do. I forget the silence that does not exist at La Santé [prison], where there is much to listen to. Here, the noise is, unfortunately, constant. But - like in the desert - inner life strengthens in jail.\"",

    "body": "A Chicago man who allegedly doused a woman in gasoline and lit her on fire on 17 November was a \"career criminal\", the White House has said. Lawrence Reed who was arrested for the crime had 72 prior arrests that include eight felony convictions and seven misdemeanours, according to the White House. The victim, 26-year-old Bethany MaGee, survived the attack but is \"now fighting for her life with horrific burns\", the White house said in a statement.In court on Monday, Mr Reed yelled three times in succession \"I'm guilty\", after the judge warned he could receive a life sentence for charges that include committing a terrorist attack, according to reports from inside the courtroom. The White House has sought to blame the incident on Democrats' policies on crime, casting them as \"soft\". Both the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago are led by Democrats, and President Donald Trump is currently seeking to withhold federal funds from Illinois over its elimination of \"cash bail\", where an arrested person posts a sum of money to be released from jail before trial.The suspect \"was walking free because of the radical, dangerous 'no cash bail' law proudly signed by Governor JB Pritzker and celebrated by Chicago's defund-the-police Mayor Brandon Johnson\", the White House said in a statement it released on Tuesday. Mayor Johnson said in a statement that the attack \"was a tragic incident, and the Mayor's prayers are with the victim and her family.\"Mr Reed, 50, has a history of mental illness and has been arrested 72 times since he turned 18, according to a Chicago affiliate of the BBC's partner CBS News.In August, he was charged with aggravated battery for allegedly hitting a social worker and after his arrest was released with electronic monitoring against prosecutors' objections. The attack against Ms MaGee happened while she was \"minding her own business and reading her phone\", prosecutors said. According to the criminal complaint, she was approached by Mr Reed arriving from the back of the train car who then doused her with gasoline before she ran.As he chased her, the complaint said, Mr Reed ignited the rest of the liquid in the bottle and set Ms MaGee on fire. Footage of the incident appeared to show Mr Reed watching Ms MaGee as she rolled on the floor engulfed in flames attempting to extinguish the fire. Last week,  Mayor Johnson said the attack \"should have never happened\", characterising it as \"an absolute failure of our criminal justice as well as our mental health institutions\". He said the suspect clearly faced mental health challenges and presented a danger to himself and the community.As a county commissioner, Johnson in 2020 introduced a nonbinding resolution to redirect funds from police and jails to other public services, but while running for mayor in 2023 he promised not to cut police spending.",

    "body": "Venezuela has banned six major international airlines from landing in the country after they failed to meet a 48-hour deadline to resume flights there.The airlines had temporarily suspended their routes into the capital, Caracas, after the US warned of \"heightened military activity\" in the area.Angered by this, the Venezuelan government issued the carriers with an ultimatum that expired on Wednesday. While a number of smaller airlines continue to fly to Venezuela, thousands of passengers have been affected.The US has deployed a large force to waters off Venezuela, which it says is to combat drug trafficking but which Venezuela's leader has denounced as an attempt to overthrow him. Venezuela's civil aviation authority, which reports to the country's ministry of transport, announced on Wednesday that Iberia, TAP Portugal, Gol, Latam, Avianca and Turkish Airlines would lose their landing and take-off rights with immediate effect.In a reference to the heightened US military activity off the coast of Venezuela, it also accused the airlines of \"joining the actions of state terrorism promoted by the United States government and unilaterally suspending air commercial operations\".The US has deployed 15,000 troops and the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, to within striking distance of Venezuela.Tracking build-up of US military planes and warships near VenezuelaThe US says the aim of the deployment, the largest by the US in the region since it invaded Panama in 1989, is to combat drug trafficking.US forces have carried out at least 21 strikes on boats they say were carrying drugs, killing more than 80 people. However, they have not provided evidence that the boats carried drugs and many analysts have pointed out that the US deployment is unusually large for a counter-narcotics operation. The Venezuelan government thinks the aim of the operation is to depose President Nicolás Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced by the Venezuelan opposition and many foreign nations as rigged. Amid the rising tensions, the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) issued a warning on Friday to flight operators operating in Maiquetía, the international airport serving Caracas. It urged airlines \"to exercise caution... at all altitudes due to the worsening security situation and heightened military activity in and around Venezuela\".It was in the wake of that warning that the now-banned airlines suspended their flights to Venezuela. An attempt by aviation industry body Iata to defuse the situation - by stressing that its member airlines were keen to restore operations - failed to appease the Venezuelan government.In recent days, both Maduro and his US counterpart Donald Trump have signalled a willingness to hold direct talks.Asked about it on Air Force One, Trump said that he \"might talk\" to Maduro, but also warned that \"we can do things the easy way, that's fine, and if we have to do it the hard way that's fine, too\".Maduro, meanwhile, uploaded a video of himself driving around Caracas pointing to Christmas decorations, in what appeared to be an attempt to show that life in the city was going on as normal.",

    "body": "Australia's landmark social media ban for children is being challenged in the nation's highest court, with two teenagers alleging the law is unconstitutional as it robs them of their right to free communication.From 10 December, social media firms - including Meta, TikTok and YouTube - must ensure that Australians aged under 16 cannot hold accounts on their platforms.The law, which is being watched closely around the world, was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful content and algorithms. However, 15-year-olds Noah Jones and Macy Neyland - backed by a rights group - will argue the ban completely disregards the rights of children.\"We shouldn't be silenced. It's like Orwell's book 1984, and that scares me,\" Macy Neyland said in a statement.After news of the case broke, Communications Minister Anika Wells told parliament the government would not be swayed.\"We will not be intimidated by threats. We will not be intimidated by legal challenges. We will not be intimidated by big tech. On behalf of Australian parents, we will stand firm,\" she said.The Digital Freedom Project (DFP) announced the case had been filed in the High Court on Wednesday. Teenagers rely on social media for information and association, and a ban could hurt the nation's most vulnerable kids - young people with disability, First Nations youth, rural and remote kids and LGBTIQ+ teenagers - the most, the group said on their website.Led by a New South Wales parliamentarian, John Ruddick, DFP said their challenge would hinge on the ban's impact on political communication, and whether it was proportional to the law's aims.Other measures to improve online safety should be used instead, the group argued, pointing to digital literacy programmes, the forced introduction of age-appropriate features for platforms, and age assurance technologies which have greater privacy protections.Noah Jones argued the government's policy was \"lazy\". \"We are the true digital natives and we want to remain educated, robust, and savvy in our digital world... They should protect kids with safeguards, not silence.\"Australian media have previously reported that Google, which owns YouTube, has also been considering launching a constitutional challenge.Though opposed by the tech companies who will be charged with enforcing it, the ban is supported by most Australian adults, according to polls. However, some mental health advocates say it may cut kids off from connection, and others say it could push youngsters to even-less-regulated corners of the internet.",

    "body": "2 hours agoGrace Tsoi,BBC World ServiceandBBC News Chinese,Hong KongBBCJimmy Lai, 78, faces life in prison for national security offencesOn a winter morning in 2022 Raphael Wong and Figo Chan walked into Hong Kong's Stanley prison to meet Jimmy Lai, the media billionaire who had been arrested two years before and was awaiting trial charged with national security offences.They had all been part of the turbulent protests that had rocked Hong Kong in 2019, when hundreds of thousands took to the streets demanding democracy and more freedom in the Chinese territory. They would also often meet for dinner, sometimes lavish meals, gossiping and bantering over dim sum, pizza or claypot rice.In prison, he \"loved eating rice with pickled ginger,\" Chan said. \"No-one could have imagined Jimmy Lai would eat something like that!\"But neither had they imagined a reunion at a maximum security prison, the protests crushed, friends and fellow activists jailed, Hong Kong just as boisterous and yet, changed. And gone was the owner of the irreverent nickname \"Fatty Lai\": he had lost considerable weight.Decades apart - Lai in his 70s, Wong and Chan about 40 years younger - they had still dreamed of a different Hong Kong. Lai was a key figure in the protests, wielding his most influential asset, the hugely popular newspaper, Apple Daily, in the hope of shaping Hong Kong into a liberal democracy. That proved risky under a contentious national security law imposed in 2020 by China's Communist Party rulers in Beijing.Lai always said he owed Hong Kong. Although he is a UK citizen, he refused to leave. \"I got everything I have because of this place,\" he told the BBC hours before he was arrested in 2020. \"This is my redemption,\" he said, choking up.He wanted the city to continue to have the freedom it had given him. That's what drove his politics - fiercely critical of the Communist Party and avowedly supportive of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. It cost him his own freedom.Watch: Jimmy Lai's last interview as a free man in 2020Lai harboured \"a rabid hatred\" of the Chinese Communist Party and \"an obsession to change the Party's values to those of the Western world\", the High Court ruled in December when it convicted him. It said that Lai had hoped the party would be ousted - or, at the very least, that its leader Xi Jinping would be removed.Lai was found guilty on all counts of charges he had always denied, including sedition under a separate colonial-era law.  The most serious one, colluding with foreign forces, carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.On 9 February, the court jailed him for 20 years in a hearing that lasted less than 30 minutes. It is the harshest sentence given so far under the NSL - \"an effective death sentence\", given his age, according to rights groups.    \"Never,\" Lai had said to the charge of collusion when he testified, arguing that he had only advocated for what he believed were Hong Kong's values: \"rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly\".His conviction in December was welcomed by Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee, who said Lai had used his newspaper to \"wantonly create social conflicts\" and \"glorify violence\". The law, he added, never allows anyone to harm the country \"under the guise of human rights, democracy and freedom\".Getty ImagesLai's wife Teresa and son Shun-yan at court for Lai's verdict, along with Cardinal Joseph Zen, former bishop of Hong Kong who baptised Lai in 1997 Back in 2022, before Wong and Chan left the prison, Lai asked them to pray with him, to Wong's surprise.Lai's Catholic faith had deepened in solitary confinement - an arrangement he had requested, according to authorities. He prayed six hours a day and he made drawings of Christ, which he sent in the mail to friends. \"Even though he was suffering,\" Wong said, \"he didn't complain nor was he afraid. He was at peace.\"Peace was not what Jimmy Lai had pursued for much of his life - not when he fled China as a 12-year-old, not while he worked his way up the gruelling factory chain, not even after he became a famous Hong Kong tycoon, and certainly not as his media empire took on Beijing.For Lai, Hong Kong was everything that China was not - deeply capitalist, a land of opportunity and limitless wealth, and free. In the city, which was still a British colony when he arrived in 1959, he found success - and then a voice.Apple Daily became one of the top-selling papers almost instantly after its debut in 1995. Modelled on USA Today, it revolutionised the aesthetics and layout of newspapers, and kicked off a cut-throat price war.From a guide to hiring prostitutes in the \"adult section\" to investigative reports, to columns by economists and novelists, it was a \"buffet\" targeting \"a full range of readers\", said Francis Lee, a journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Former editors and employees spoke of Lai's encouragement - \"If you dared to do it, he would dare to let you do it\" - and his temper. One said he often swore.They describe him as unconventional, and as a visionary who wasn't afraid to bet on experiments. \"Even before the iPhone was launched, he kept saying mobile phones would be the future,\" recalled one of the paper's editors, adding that he was full of ideas. \"It was as if he asked us to create a new website every day.\"It had been the same when he owned a clothing label. \"He was not afraid of disrupting the industry, and he was not afraid of making enemies,\" said Herbert Chow, a former marketing director at a rival brand.That was both his making and undoing, Chow said: \"Otherwise, there would have been no Apple Daily. Of course, he wouldn't have ended up like this either.\"An early TV commercial for Apple Daily featured the then 48-year-old Lai biting the forbidden fruit while dozens of arrows took aim at him.It became a self-fulfilling prophecy.Jimmylai.substack.comThe Apple Daily commercial when it launched in 1995Escape from ChinaIt was his first taste of chocolate that beckoned Lai to Hong Kong as a boy.After carrying a passenger's luggage at a railway station in China, Lai was given a tip, and a bar of chocolate. He took a bite. \"I asked him where he's from. He said Hong Kong. I said, 'Hong Kong must be heaven' because I had never tasted anything like that,\" Lai said of the encounter in a 2007 documentary, The Call of the Entrepreneur.Life in Mao Zedong's China was punctuated by waves of oppressive campaigns - to industrialise China overnight, to weed out capitalist \"class enemies\". The Lais, once a family of business people, were blacklisted. His father fled to Hong Kong, leaving them behind. His mother was sent to a labour camp.Decades later, Lai wrote of how of he and his sisters would be dragged out of their homes to watch a crowd forcing their mother to kneel while she was shoved and taunted - cruel public shaming that soon became the norm. The first time, Lai wrote, was terrifying: \"My tears flowed freely and wet my shirt. I dared not make a move. My body was burning with humiliation.\"Uncowed, his grandmother finished every story with the same message: \"You have to become a businessman even if you only sell seasoned peanuts!\"And so, at the age of 12, he set off for Hong Kong, among millions who fled the mainland - and Mao's devastating rule - over the years.The day he arrived, on the bottom of a fishing boat, along with about 80 seasick travellers, he was hired by a mitten factory. He described the long working hours as a \"very happy time, a time that I knew I had a future\". It was there that one of his co-workers helped him learn English. Years later, he would give interviews and even testify at court in fluent English.By his early 20s, he was managing a textile factory and after making money on the stock market, he started his own, Comitex Knitters. He was 27.Getty ImagesJimmy Lai at his home in Hong Kong in 1993 Business often took Lai to New York, and on one of those trips, he was lent a book that came to define his worldview: The Road to Serfdom by Nobel Prize-winning economist Friedrich Hayek, a champion of free-market capitalism. \"People's spontaneous reaction\" and \"the exchange of information\" have created the best in the world, was his takeaway. To him, that was Hong Kong's strength.The book spurred a voracious reading habit. He would read the same book multiple times, and read every book by authors he admired.  \"I want to turn the author's thoughts into my backyard garden. I want to buy a garden, not cut flowers,\" he said in a 2009 interview.After a decade in manufacturing, he was \"bored\" and founded the clothing chain Giordano in 1981, which became a fast-fashion pioneer. It was so successful that Tadashi Yanai sought advice from Lai when his Japanese label Uniqlo opened shops.Lai launched stores in China, which had begun to open up after Mao died. He was \"excited\", China \"was going to be changed, like a Western country\", he said in the 2007 documentary.Giordano sold tees with photos of Tiananmen protest leaders and anti-Beijing slogans, and put up pro-democracy banners in stores across Hong Kong.A million people marched in Hong Kong in solidarity with student protesters in Beijing. Until 2020, Hong Kong held the largest vigil that mourned the massacre.Lai said later that he \"didn't feel anything about China\" until then. He had always wanted to forget that part of his life but \"all of a sudden, it was like my mother was calling in the darkness of the night\".Getty ImagesLai was a frequent attendee at Hong Kong 's annual vigils in memory of those who died at Tiananmen Square in 1989'Choice is freedom'The following year Lai launched a magazine called Next, and in 1994 published an open letter to Li Peng, \"the Butcher of Beijing\" who played a key role in the Tiananmen massacre. He called him \"the son of a turtle egg with zero intelligence\".Beijing was furious. Between 1994 and 1996, Giordano's flagship store in Beijing and 11 franchises in Shanghai closed. Lai sold his shares and stepped down as chairman.\"If I just go on making money, it doesn't mean anything to me. But if I go into the media business, then I deliver information, which is choice, and choice is freedom,\" Lai said in the 2007 documentary.He soon became a \"very active participant\" in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, meeting leaders to discuss strategy, said Lee Wing Tat, a former lawmaker from the Democratic Party.He became an outspoken critic of the CCP, writing in 1994: \"I entirely oppose the Communist Party because I hate everything that restrains personal liberties.\" He also started to voice concerns about the looming handover of Hong Kong, from Britain to China, in 1997. \"After more than a century of colonial rule, Hong Kongers feel proud to return to the embrace of the motherland,\" he wrote. \"But should we love the motherland even if it doesn't have freedom?\"During the handover, however, China's then-leader Jiang Zemin promised that Hongkongers would govern Hong Kong and the city would have a high degree of autonomy for the next 50 years.Getty ImagesLai at an \"Occupy Central\" protest in Admiralty in October 2014The 2014 Umbrella Movement sparked by Beijing's refusal to allow completely free elections in Hong Kong became another turning point for Lai.Protesters occupied the city's main commercial districts for 79 days. Lai turned up from 9am to 5pm every day, undeterred after a man threw animal entrails at him. \"When the police started firing tear gas, I was with Fatty,\" the former lawmaker Lee recalled.The movement ended when the court ordered protest sites to be cleared, but the government did not budge. Five years later, in 2019, Hong Kong erupted again, this time because of a controversial plan that would have allowed extradition to mainland China.What began as peaceful marches became increasingly violent, turning the city into a battleground for six months. Black-clad protesters threw bricks and Molotov cocktails, stormed parliament and started fires; riot police fired tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons and live rounds.Lai was at the forefront of the protests and served 20 months for participating in four unauthorised assemblies. A protester told the BBC he was surprised to see Lai: \"To me, he's a busy businessman, but he showed up.\"Getty ImagesLai at a pro-democracy march in 2019 Apple Daily provided blanket coverage or, as critics would argue, a sounding board for an anti-government movement.Government adviser Ronny Tong said Lai was \"instrumental\" in the protests because Apple Daily carried a \"totally false\" slogan – anti-extradition to China – which \"caught the imagination of people who wanted to cause havoc in Hong Kong\".Whether Apple Daily played a seditious role, and how much control Lai exerted over its stance was at the centre of his 156-day national security trial.Lai instructed the editorial team to \"urge people to take to the streets\", according to Cheung Kim-hung, former chief executive of Apple Daily's parent company Next Digital, and a defendant-turned-prosecution witness. After the National Security Law took effect, the newspaper was raided twice and eventually shut down in 2021.During the height of the protests, Lai flew to the US where he met then Vice-President Mike Pence to discuss the situation in Hong Kong. A month before the National Security Law was imposed, Lai launched a controversial campaign, despite internal pushback, urging Apple Daily readers to send letters to then US President Donald Trump to \"save Hong Kong\".All of this, the court ruled, amounted to a public appeal for a foreign government to interfere in Hong Kong's internal affairs.\"Nobody in their right mind should think that Hong Kong can undergo any kind of political reform without at least tacit acceptance from Beijing,\" Tong said. The protests in 2014 and 2019 \"are totally against common sense\".Getty ImagesCopies of the last Apple Daily newspaper early on June 24, 2021Beijing says Hong Kong has now moved from \"chaos to governance\" and onto \"greater prosperity\" because of the national security law and a \"patriot-only\" parliament. But critics, including hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers who have since left, say dissent has been stifled, and the city's freedoms severely curbed.Lee, the lawmaker, is among them: \"When I first came to the UK, I had nightmares. I felt very guilty. Why could we live in other places freely, while our good friends were jailed?\"Lai's family has been calling for his release for years, citing concerns for his health because he is diabetic, but their calls have been rejected so far. The government and Lai's Hong Kong legal team have said that his medical needs are being met.Carmen Tsang, Lai's daughter-in-law who lives in Hong Kong with her family, says her children miss grandpa - and the big family dinners he hosted every two weeks. His loud voice scared her daughter when she was younger, but \"they loved going to grandpa's place… They think he's a funny guy\".She is not sure today's Hong Kong has a place for Lai. \"If there's a speck of dust in your eye, you just get rid of it, right?\"Watch: What does the Jimmy Lai verdict mean for democracy in Hong Kong?",

    "body": "7 hours agoIan AikmanEPAAntónio José Seguro is set to defeat far-right populist André Ventura in a landslide victoryCentre-left candidate António José Seguro is poised to comfortably beat his far-right rival to the Portuguese presidency after a run-off vote. With 95% of votes counted, Seguro has won 66%, with the leader of the far-right Chega (Enough) party, André Ventura, trailing behind on 34%.The two men went head-to-head in a campaign at times overshadowed by the deadly storms that has lashed the country in recent days.Seguro, 63, had been backed by politicians on both sides of the aisle, with several conservative figures voicing support for the moderate socialist to see off his far-right opponent.Thousands of self-declared \"non-socialists\" had signed an open letter backing Seguro for president, including former conservative ministers. The former Socialist Party leader is now set to succeed the conservative Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa as president.The role of president in Portugal is largely ceremonial, but it comes with some key powers – including the so-called \"atomic bomb\" ability to dissolve parliament and call snap elections in certain circumstances – as well as the power to veto legislation, though this can be overturned.Despite his loss on Sunday, Ventura's position in second place reflects the rapid ascent of his party, which became the second largest in Portugal's parliament last year – just six years after Chega was formed in 2019.Portugal's centre-right Prime Minister Luís Montenegro has previously denounced Ventura – a 43-year-old former football pundit – as \"xenophobic, racist and demagogic\". But the prime minister chose not to support Seguro's run for president, instead declining to endorse either candidate.",

    "body": "16 hours agoKathryn ArmstrongEPA/ShutterstockSaturday's clashes came a week after more than 100 police officers were injured in another protestSix people have been arrested after police clashed with protesters in Milan, one of the host cities of the Winter Olympic Games, during the first day of the competition. Thousands took to the streets in the northern Italian city on Saturday to protest against the Games and a range of issues including the cost of living. Some released fireworks and threw stones at police, who responded with water cannon. It comes after the government tightened protest laws in the wake of a demonstration last weekend in Turin that left more than 100 officers injured, according to government figures. Meanwhile, officials are investigating suspected sabotage on northern Italy's railway network on Saturday. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said those protesting against the Olympics were the \"enemy of Italy\" and had put images of the demonstrations \"on the televisions of half the world\", while thousands of other Italians were working hard to make the competition a success.She said this had happened \"after others locked railway cables to prevent trains from starting\". Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini described those involved in confrontations in Milan as \"criminals\". \"Just days after the shameful violence in Turin, more clashes, more attacks on law enforcement,\" he said. \"We're proud to have pushed for a new security package that will allow for even more effective interventions against thugs and criminals.\"The Turin demonstration, which was called in response to the eviction of an unofficial social centre, started peacefully but later turned violent when armed groups confronted police. More than 30 people were arrested. One officer was attacked with a hammer, which Meloni described as attempted murder. A new security package, which was adopted on Thursday after being fast-tracked as a result of the violence in Turin, allows police to detain suspected troublemakers for up to 12 hours before demonstrations to stop them from spreading unrest. Critics have called it repressive. Most of those involved in Saturday's protest in Milan marched peacefully. One woman, Francesca Missana, told news agency AFP that the Olympic Games were \"no longer sustainable from an environmental or a social point of view, their time is up\".\"These Games were promoted as sustainable and cost-neutral,\" protest organiser Alberto di Monte told AFP. He added that because the Games were spread across multiple sites, and that billions had been spent on roads instead of protecting the mountains.NurPhoto via Getty ImagesSevered cables were discovered near Bologna, which has a major transport hubSaturday also saw chaos on some of Italy's northern rail networks, with suspected attacks delaying people for hours. A fire hit rail infrastructure between Bologna and Venice, and police later found severed cables and an explosive device in locations nearby.Police said a track switch was set alight near Pesaro on the Adriatic coast and electric cables were found severed near Bologna, along with a rudimentary explosive device left by a track.Bologna's central rail station is a major hub, linking cities in the north and south, and east to west lines.RFI, which owns the country's railways, said services have since returned to normal. \"These actions of unprecedented seriousness do not in any way tarnish Italy's image in the world, an image that the Games will make even more compelling,\" Salvini, who is also Italy's transport minister, said on Saturday.The Winter Olympics are taking place until 22 February in a number of locations, from Milan to the resort town of Cortina d'Ampezzo, the Dolomite regions of Predazzo and Tesero, and the Alpine resorts of Livigno and Bormio.",

    "body": "11 hours agoHenri AstierAFP via Getty ImagesTwo identical twins on trial for murder in France have confounded attempts to determine which one pulled the trigger because they have the same DNA, French media report.The 33-year-old brothers are among five defendants on trial near Paris, accused of a double murder and several subsequent attempted killings in 2020, according to reputable French newspaper Le Parisien.It reports that both are suspected of conspiring to plot the double murder, but that DNA on an assault rifle used in one of the later gun battles could only be from one twin.A police officer told the court that forensic experts were unable to tell which of the brothers had been conclusively implicated.\"Only their mother can tell them apart,\" one investigator is quoted as telling the court in Bobigny, north of the French capital.There is reportedly a tense atmosphere in the court where the trial is taking place. On Tuesday, both twins were said to have been expelled from the courtroom for refusing to stand up.Police believe they have taken advantage of their resemblance to cover their tracks. A senior officer quoted by Le Parisien said the pair frequently exchanged clothes, phones and identification documents.Identical twins develop from a single fertilised egg that splits during pregnancy. Because they originate from the same egg and sperm, they share exactly the same DNA, making forensic identification extremely difficult.With genetic data unable to distinguish between them, investigators relied on phone records, surveillance footage, wiretaps and efforts to corroborate their whereabouts and movements, according to Le Parisien.But the crucial question of who fired the recovered weapon remains an open one. The trial continues, with court due to reach a decision in late February.",

    "body": "1 day agoChris GrahamReutersSussan Ley said it was time to look to the futureAustralia's Liberal-National Coalition, the country's main opposition, reunited on Sunday, more than two weeks after the centre-right partners split in a row over hate speech laws.\"The coalition is back together and looking to the future, not to the past,\" Liberal Party leader Sussan Ley said, appearing alongside National Party leader David Littleproud in Canberra.The coalition split on 22 January after the Nationals refused to back reforms introduced by the government after two gunmen killed 15 people at a Jewish festival at Bondi Beach in December, citing free speech concerns.\"It's been disappointing, we've got to where we are but it was over a substantive issue,\" Littleproud said.The coalition suffered a heavy election loss last year and the split last month was the second in less than 12 months.  Last year's separation in May - largely over climate and energy policy - was resolved within a week.This time the divisions were sown by hate speech reforms introduced by the centre-left Labor government after the Bondi Beach attack.While the Liberals sided with the government, their National colleagues abstained from the vote in the lower house and voted against the measure in the Senate, saying the measures had been rushed and posed a threat to free speech.The legislation includes provisions that will ban groups deemed to spread hate and introduce tougher penalties for preachers who advocate violence.Ley said the coalition had a responsibility to find a way back into government.\"I acknowledge this has been a difficult time. It has been a difficult time for millions of our coalition supporters and many other Australians who rely on our two great parties to provide scrutiny and leadership,\" she said.The Liberal leader said both parties had struck an agreement that neither party could overturn decisions taken by the coalition's joint \"shadow cabinet\".Dating back to the 1940s, the coalition had not split since 1987 before the brief separation last year. The National Party mainly represents regional communities and often leans more conservative than the Liberals.The coalition is facing pressure from populist Senator Pauline Hanson's anti-immigration One Nation party, which has surged in polling, while the Liberal Party lost a swathe of seats at last year's federal election.",

    "body": "2 hours agoYang TianGetty ImagesTrain drivers in Spain are due to begin a three-day nationwide strike on Monday in protest of what they say is a lack of safety guarantees on the country's rail system.The action follows two fatal train crashes in January, one in Adamuz in the country's southern region which killed 46 people, and the second just two days later near Barcelona where a train driver died and dozens were injured.The accidents have caused severe disruption for travellers and cast doubt on Spain's much-vaunted rail system.Semaf, the train drivers' union, are demanding the hiring of more staff and increased investment and maintenance in what it has described as \"the constant deterioration of the rail network\".Following the two collisions, subsequent safety checks also revealed faults and maintenance issues on a number of routes.Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is due to be grilled in parliament later this week about the failures in the rail system.A preliminary report by rail accident investigation commission CIAF has found that grooves found on the wheels of the derailed train and three earlier trains suggests that a fracture in the track occurred before the train went over it.Rail officials believe the wall collapsed as the train was passing, striking the driver's cab first and then causing considerable damage to the first carriage of the train in which most of the injured passengers were travelling.Semaf has previously said the collisions represent \"a turning point in demanding that all necessary actions be taken to guarantee the safety of railway operations\".The amount of investment the rail network receives has come under particular scrutiny. The Socialist-led government has sought to dismiss such queries, pointing out that €700m (£605m) has been invested in updating the Madrid-Andalusia line in recent years, with the stretch of track where the accident took place included in that renovation.\"We're not looking at a problem of lack of maintenance, we're not looking at a problem of obsolete [infrastructure], and we're not looking at a problem of lack of investment,\" said Transport Minister Óscar Puente.",

    "body": "14 hours agoKayla EpsteinGetty ImagesThe lead singer and songwriter of US band 3 Doors Down, Brad Arnold, has died after a battle with cancer aged 47, the rock band announced on X.\"He will be deeply missed and forever remembered,\" the band said in a statement on Saturday. The band is best known for 2000s rock hits like Kryptonite, Here Without You, When I'm Gone, and Loser.Arnold had announced in May 2025 that he was ill and had received a diagnosis of stage four clear cell renal carcinoma - a type of kidney cancer - which had metastasised into his lung. \"I have no fear, I really sincerely am not scared of it at all,\" the frontman said, adding that he was disappointed that the band would have to cancel an upcoming tour.\"I'd love for you to lift me up in prayer every chance you get,\" he said.In its statement, 3 Doors Down said that, as a founding member, vocalist, and original drummer, \"Brad helped redefine mainstream rock music, blending post-grunge accessibility with emotionally direct song writing and lyrical themes that resonated with everyday listeners\".  The original band was formed in Mississippi in the mid-1990s. Another founding member of the original trio, Matt Roberts, died in 2016 at the age of 38.Arnold wrote Kryptonite, the band's 2000 breakout hit, \"in his math class when he was just 15 years old\", the statement continued.Those closest to Arnold will \"remember not only his talent, but his warmth, humility, faith, and deep love for his family and friends\", it said. He is survived by his wife, Jennifer.The band was regularly heard on rock and pop radio throughout the 2000s and 2010s. They have won three Billboard Music Awards.Their debut album The Better Life was the 18th biggest-selling album of 2000 in the US, according to Billboard.Arnold had spoken openly about his battle with alcoholism and his recovery, having been sober since 2016.\"I used to think it was a way to calm myself prior to a show or to chase loneliness,\" he told Charleston.com in 2023.The band performed for the inauguration of US President George W Bush as well as the first inauguration of President Donald Trump, which received some criticism from fans.Their manager, Angus Vail, defended the decision to perform for the 2017 Trump presidential celebration, telling Vice: \"They are good Mississippi and Alabama boys - they come from conservative families.\"In 2004, 3 Doors Down established a charity, the Better Life Foundation, to create \"positive change in the lives of children in need of food, shelter and medical assistance\". The band hosts a yearly concert to raise funds for the organisation.\"All the money that goes into that [charity] comes from fans, and people, that they give to us,\" Arnold told Antihero magazine in 2021.\"But being able to see what that's done over the years has definitely enriched my life.\"Correction 8 February 2026: An earlier version of this article said The Better Life was the 11th biggest-selling album of the year. This was later updated to say it was the 18th biggest selling album of 2000 in the US, according to Billboard.",

    "body": "10 hours agoChris GrahamGetty ImagesWill Lewis stepped down days after overseeing mass lay-offs at the US newspaperThe chief executive of the Washington Post is stepping down, the newspaper has announced, days after overseeing mass lay-offs.William Lewis said in a message to staff that it was the right time to leave and that \"difficult decisions\" had been made to ensure the paper's future.The newspaper had announced on Wednesday that it was cutting a third of its workforce, dramatically scaling back its coverage of sport and international news. The decision was condemned by many journalists and prompted criticism of the Post's billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos. Executive editor Matt Murray said the cuts would bring \"stability\".Jeff D'Onofrio, who joined as the newspaper's chief financial officer last year, will serve as acting publisher and CEO, the Post said as it announced Lewis's departure.A former Dow Jones chief executive and publisher of the Wall Street Journal, Lewis was appointed to the role at the Washington Post in 2023.He has faced criticism from subscribers and employees as he tried to reverse financial losses at the daily.Hundreds protested in front of the paper's headquarters in Washington DC on Thursday after the mass lay-offs, which included the paper's entire Middle East staff and its Kyiv-based Ukraine correspondent.A GoFundMe page has been set up to support international employees hired locally or from subsidiaries outside the US - and therefore not eligible for protections afforded to members of the Washington Post Guild, the paper's union - who may be facing a sudden loss of housing, visas or benefits.\"Among those laid off are reporters in war zones living without electricity, breaking news hub reporters and editors in Seoul and London who cover atrocities around the world every day, correspondents who upended their lives to move overseas just a few months ago, and indispensable local staff without whom our journalism would be impossible,\" organiser Michelle Lee wrote on the page on Saturday.\"They are a dedicated, talented, multilingual, brilliant bunch. They don't deserve this.\"The page had raised more than $180,000 (£130,000) out of a target of $200,000 as of Sunday evening.A separate GoFundMe page organised by the guild for US staff has already raised more than $500,000.Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor until 2021, said the cuts ranked \"among the darkest days in the history of one of the world's greatest news organisations\".The departure of Lewis marks the latest upheaval for the leading US newspaper, which has seen a series of staff cuts and controversial editorial decisions in recent years.ReutersJeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, acquired the Washington Post in 2013The newspaper had endorsed a candidate in most presidential elections since the 1970s - all of whom had been Democrats. The move caused widespread criticism and led to the loss of tens of thousands of subscribers. Meanwhile, the opinion editor resigned in February last year when Bezos decided to focus the paper's comment section on \"personal liberties and free markets\". Bezos, who acquired the newspaper in 2013, said pieces opposing those views would not be published.",

    "body": "1 day agoHenri AstierAFP via Getty ImagesFinancial crime prosecutors in France say they have opened a preliminary inquiry into former Culture Minister Jack Lang over his links to Jeffrey Epstein.Lang, a major figure in French socialist governments between the 1980s and 2000s, is being investigated for suspected \"laundering of tax fraud proceeds\". It follows the US Department of Justice's release of the Epstein files, which have documented links between the Lang family and the late American sex offender.Lang, now 86, denies wrongdoing and on Saturday described the allegations against him as \"baseless\". He told AFP the investigation \"will bring much light on to the accusations that are questioning my probity and my honour\".Hours after the investigation was announced, Lang offered to resign as head of the Arab World Institute, a body that promotes cooperation and exchanges between France and Arab nations.In a letter to Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, seen by AFP, Lang said he would submit his resignation at the next board meeting. Barrot, who had summoned Lang for talks on Sunday, said he had acknowledged the resignation offer and planned to start the process of looking for a successor. Lang's daughter Caroline, 64, is also being investigated in the case. Earlier this week she stepped down as head of a French film producers' union.On Tuesday, he told broadcaster BFMTV he had known nothing about Epstein's crimes when he met him \"some 15 years ago\". The US financier was convicted in Florida in 2008 of soliciting a minor for prostitution.Lang - who served as culture minister between 1981 and 1993 and later as minister of education - says he was introduced to Epstein by US actor-director Woody Allen.He said he had found Epstein \"passionate about art, culture and cinema\".In a separate interview on Tuesday, he told RTL radio that Epstein had been \"generous\" and \"courteous\", adding: \"When I meet people I don't ask to see their criminal record.\"Details from the files revealed by French media suggest Lang appealed to Epstein for funds or favours on several occasions - including the use of Epstein's car and private plane for himself and his family.Caroline Lang told French news website Mediapart that she met Epstein in 2012, when he told her he wanted to \"invest in young French and international artists\".She said his lawyers had set up a company, Prytanee LLC, based in the US Virgin Islands. Mediapart said Caroline Lang had received half of the shares, but she said she had not invested in it or received any funds from it.An email in the Epstein files suggested she contributed her art knowledge, Mediapart reports. She told the website she had been \"incredibly naive\".Resigning from her post in the Independent Production Union, she said: \"I do not want this situation to in any way harm the union.\"The files do not suggest either Lang or his daughter were implicated in Epstein's sexual crimes.Epstein died in prison in New York in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.AFP via Getty ImagesLang (right) made his name in the 1980s, under the presidency of François Mitterrand (left)",

Perkins Rocha, Jesús Armas and Luis Tarbay were also named as having been released.Since Venezuela's widely disputed presidential election in 2024 - which saw Maduro officially re-elected despite opposition tallies suggesting their candidate had won by a landslide - critics of his regime said legal proceedings against activists, journalists and Maduro's political adversaries increased.Among them was Guanipa, who went into hiding after being accused of terrorism and treason for challenging the 2024 result.He was tracked down by Venezuela's security forces and detained in May 2025.Opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Machado, who was also in hiding at the time, said her colleague had been \"kidnapped\" in \"an act of state terrorism\".Guanipa is the leader of the centre-right Justice First party. He was elected governor of the Zulia region but barred from taking office after he refused to swear an oath before Maduro's National Constituent Assembly.ReutersGuanipa was tracked down and detained by Venezuela's security forces in May 2025With Maduro standing trial on drug trafficking charges in New York, Guanipa's son appeared sceptical a few days after the interim government announced its \"goodwill gesture\".Ramón Guanipa told BBC Mundo at the time that he felt \"defeated\" when his father was not among the first detainees to be released.\"But at the same time, you find another reason to fight,\" he said. \"I'm fighting for them [the interim government] to actually do what they say they're going to do.\"Releasing political prisoners was one of US President Donald Trump's demands of the interim government, describing it as \"a very important and smart gesture\" from Venezuela.He chose not to install Machado as Venezuela's president after capturing Maduro in a daring raid on Caracas, instead allowing Maduro ally Delcy Rodriguez to take over.",

    "body": "Man named in South Africa's police corruption probe found dead18 hours agoDamian ZaneGetty ImagesA South African man named in a major police corruption probe has died after reportedly shooting himself at a petrol station.Police are now investigating the death of Wiandre Pretorius, 41, who last week said he had survived an assassination attempt.Pretorius's name had been mentioned at the ongoing corruption inquiry, known as the Madlanga Commission. This was in connection with the 2022 murder of a man, Emmanuel Mbense, allegedly at the hands of police officers.Four of the 12 people named as persons of interest in that killing are now dead themselves, a police spokesperson said.At 22:00 local time (20:00 GMT) on Saturday the police received reports that a man had taken his own life at a petrol station in Brakpan, east of Johannesburg. At the scene, officers found Pretorius's body with a firearm next to it, spokesperson Brig Athlenda Mathe said.The police are now looking at CCTV footage to confirm what happened. There had been reports that Pretorius had been involved in a row with his fiancée at the petrol station before taking his own life.The murder four years ago of Mbense is one of several issues that has come up at the Madlanga Commission, which was set up by President Cyril Ramaphosa after a senior police officer alleged that organised crime groups had infiltrated the government.At a hearing last year, a man, only identified at the time as Witness D, said that in 2022 he had been ordered to get rid of the body of someone accused of robbery who had allegedly been tortured and killed by police officers.Witness D also alleged that Pretorius, who was not a policeman but had previously served as a police reservist, was involved.The witness, later named as Marius van der Merwe, was shot death three weeks after testifying.Police spokesperson Mathe said on Sunday that Pretorius had been questioned and his firearms confiscated in connection with Van der Merwe's killing.Mathe added that the death of Pretorius on Saturday night leaves only eight of the original 12 persons of interest in the killing of Mbense still alive.Three were killed \"execution style\" – one in 2023 and two last year.\"The question is: are we dealing with a syndicate that is eliminating each other in relation to the Emmanel Mbense murder? That is what our detectives are probing,\" Mathe told reporters.Last week, police began investigating whether Pretorius himself had been the target of an assassination attempt after he said that his vehicle had been shot at.In connection with the murder of Mbense, Mathe said that \"arrests are imminent\" following an investigation by the independent police watchdog body.More about South Africa from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "12 hours agoKathryn ArmstrongReutersFriday's shooting took place at a residential block of flats in the north-western outskirts of MoscowRussia says it has identified three suspects involved in the shooting of high-profile military figure Lt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev. They include the man accused of having carried out the attack, named as Ukrainian-born Russian citizen Lyubomir Korba. Russia's Investigations Committee (SK) said Korba arrived in the capital, Moscow, in late December \"on assignment from Ukrainian intelligence services to commit a terrorist attack\". Kyiv has reportedly denied involvement.Alexeyev, 64, was taken to hospital after the attack in a residential block of flats in the north-western outskirts of Moscow on Friday. He has since regained consciousness following surgery, according to Russian media reports.Alexeyev is number two in the main directorate of GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency, and the latest high-ranking military figure to have been targeted in or near Moscow since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Spokeswoman Svetlana Petrenko said on Sunday that his attacker had fired three shots before fleeing and that Korba had then travelled to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the hours after the shooting. He has since been arrested and extradited. Russian state TV channel Ru-24 aired footage showing security agents escorting Korba off a plane at an unknown location.\"Investigators conducted a thorough inspection at the scene, during which they discovered the murder weapon - a Makarov pistol with a silencer and three rounds of ammunition,\" Petrenko added. Forensic tests are being carried out on the gun. Russian media, quoting Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, reported that President Vladimir Putin had thanked UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on Saturday for his country's help in catching Korba.Russian Defence MinistryLt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev is number two in the main directorate of Russia's GRU military intelligenceUkrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha was quoted by Reuters as saying on Friday that Kyiv had nothing to do with the shooting, suggesting that it was an internal Russian affair. His Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov accused Kyiv of carrying out the attack as a way to disrupt negotiations on ending the war between the two countries, which began in February 2022. Alexeyev's boss, GRU head Adm Igor Kostyukov, has been leading the Russian delegation at recent trilateral talks with Ukraine and the US in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE. Korba is alleged to have had at least one accomplice. A man named by the SK as Viktor Vasin has been arrested and charged by the authorities in Moscow.A woman named as Zinaida Serebritskaya, who has since left for Ukraine, is also thought to be involved, but Petrenko did not elaborate on how. Ukraine has claimed some attacks on Russian military figures in the past, while Russian intelligence officials claimed they had thwarted an attempted attack on a Russian soldier in St Petersburg at the end of last month.An Uzbek man was jailed in January for the 2024 killing of another general, Igor Kirillov, in an explosion outside a block of flats in Moscow. Sources in Ukraine's SBU intelligence said at the time that it had been behind the attack.Lt Gen Kirillov had been in charge of Russia's nuclear, biological and chemical protection troops.In December 2025, another high-ranking officer in the GRU, Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, was killed when an explosive device detonated under a car in Moscow. He was in charge of the armed force's operational training department, according to the SK.Russia is also thought to have targeted high-profile Ukrainian military and political figures during the Russia-Ukraine war.Last July, Ukrainian security services said they had thwarted an attempt on the life of Serhiy Filimonov, commander of an assault unit known as the \"Da Vinci Wolves\".Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has himself been subjected to numerous assassination and kidnapping plots, and Kyrylo Budanov - who until January this year was head of Ukraine's military intelligence - also says he has been targeted.",

    "body": "10 hours agoKaty Watson,Australia correspondentandSimon AtkinsonBBCMany of the victims had moved to New Zealand to work or study, and some were refugees who thought they had found safetyA white supremacist who killed 51 people at two New Zealand mosques will appear in court this week to try to withdraw his guilty plea.Australian Brenton Tarrant is serving a life sentence with no parole after admitting to murdering the 51 people and attempting to murder another 40 in the March 2019 attack on worshippers during Friday prayers in Christchurch.He initially denied the charges, but changed his plea a year after the attack.The 35-year-old, who also admitted one count of terrorism, has now launched an appeal, filed out of time, arguing he was incapable of making rational decisions at the time because of \"torturous and inhumane\" conditions in prison. He also wants to appeal against his sentence. The hearing at New Zealand's Court of Appeal in Wellington is scheduled to run all week, with Tarrant expected to give evidence via video link.The massacre at Al Noor mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre - parts of which were live-streamed - led to stricter gun laws in New Zealand.'He wants to open traumas again'Victims and family members will be able to watch the hearing via a delayed broadcast.Among those planning to attend is Aya al-Umari, who lost her older brother Hussein in the attack on Al Noor mosque.\"I very distinctly remember that I left court after the sentencing thinking 'Right, the trauma chapter is now closed, time to heal, time to focus on your own mental well-being', but then it pops up again and again,\" al-Umari told the BBC.She said she was preparing for a tough week, seeing the man who murdered her brother on screen.\"It will be just an image that I am looking at, because he means absolutely nothing to me at this stage.\"I suspect one of his main motivations to do this is to open up traumas again and I won't let him succeed in doing that - he just wants his limelight and to be relevant again.\"Hussein al-Umari was awarded a New Zealand Bravery Star, for standing up to Tarrant.\"He took the right of life of my brother and 50 others, and then we're going to sit through now and talk about the legal arguments of his right to appeal,\" al-Umari  said. \"When you place those two together, they are morally not comparable.\"Family handoutAya al-Umari and her brother HusseinAt the time of the sentencing in August 2020, then Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern said life imprisonment without parole meant Tarrant would have \"no notoriety, no platform... and we have no cause to think about him, to see him or to hear from him again\".If the three appeal court judges decide he can withdraw his guilty plea, the case would potentially go to trial on all charges.If he is not allowed to retract his plea, there will be another hearing later in the year to consider his appeal against his sentence.Tarrant was born in New South Wales, Australia, but moved to New Zealand in 2017 - which, prosecutors said, was when he started planning his attacks against the Muslim community.He was active on fringe online forums and before the attack, he had posted a 74-page \"manifesto\" online.The massacre prompted New Zealand to pass stricter gun laws and buy back certain types of weapons from owners.Within a month of the shootings, the country's parliament had voted overwhelmingly to ban military-style semi-automatic weapons as well as parts that could be used to build prohibited firearms.The government offered to compensate owners of newly-illegal weapons in a buy-back scheme.",

    "body": "9 hours agoAleks PhillipsandGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianGetty ImagesNarges Mohammadi was arrested in December for making \"provocative remarks\" at a memorialNobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi has been handed further prison sentences of seven-and-a-half years by an Iranian court, her lawyer has said.The human rights activist was sentenced to six years for \"gathering and collusion\", and one-and-a-half years for \"propaganda activities\" by a court in the north-eastern city of Mashhad, Mostafa Nili announced on social media on Sunday.The 53-year-old was made a Nobel laureate in 2023 for activism against the oppression of women in Iran.Nili, who spoke to Mohammadi for the first time since 14 December, said she had also been handed a two-year ban on leaving the country and two years of exile to the eastern Khusf region.The Narges Foundation, which supports her, described the hearing on Saturday as a \"sham\" and explained she had begun a hunger strike on 2 February.Nili said she had been taken to hospital three days ago \"due to her poor physical condition\" before being returned to the detention centre she is being held in.\"When she began to explain the events and how she was detained, the phone was disconnected.\"Mohammadi's husband, Taghi Rahmani, said she offered no defence while in court due to her \"steadfast\" belief that \"this judiciary holds no legitimacy\" and that the proceedings were \"a mere charade with a pre-determined end\".\"Though she was likely forced to attend, she remained silent - she did not utter a single word, nor did she sign a single paper.\"He described the sentence to the BBC as \"cruel and very unfair\", and called on human rights organisations to protest against the ruling.Meanwhile, Kiana Rahmani, Mohammadi's daughter, said she was \"gravely concerned\" for her mother.Mohammadi has already spent more than 10 years of her life in prison. The Narges Foundation says the latest sentence brings the total time she has been ordered to spend in prison to 44 years.Since 2021, she has been serving a 13-year sentence for \"propaganda activity against the state\" and \"collusion against state security\", charges she denies.The activist was given temporary release from Tehran's notorious Evin prison for three weeks in December 2024 on medical grounds.She was expected to return to prison soon after, where she was serving multiple sentences.The most recent arrest came as she attended a memorial for Khosrow Alikordi, a lawyer who had been found dead in his office in early December.Norway-based group Iran Human Rights has called for an independent inquiry to establish how he died, saying the circumstances surrounding his death were \"suspicious\".The Narges Foundation previously said eyewitnesses had seen Mohammadi being attacked by around 15 plainclothes agents of the regime while at the memorial event, and that some were seen pulling her hair and beating her with clubs and batons.Mashhad prosecutor Hasan Hematifar told reporters that Mohammadi had been among 39 people arrested, and she and Alikordi's brother had encouraged those present \"to chant norm-breaking slogans\" and \"disturb the peace\".Mohammadi was among signatories of a petition that expressed criticism of the Iranian authorities and held Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei responsible for what it called \"crimes against humanity\" over the killing of protesters during unrest that began in late December.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says it has counted more than 50,000 arrests related to the demonstrations and had confirmed at least 6,961 deaths.The petition called for the prosecution of those acting on Khamenei's orders and an end to the Islamic Republic.Four prominent Iranian activists - identified as Abdollah Momeni, Mehdi Mahmoudian, Vida Rabbani and Ghorban Behzadian-Nejad - have also been arrested since 31 January for their contribution to the petition.Taghi Rahmani urged the release of \"all political prisoners in Iran\".",

    "body": "2 days agoKathryn ArmstrongState Emergency Service of UkraineA fire broke out at a warehouse in the city of Yahotyn as a result of a Russian drone strikeUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says the US wants the war with Russia to end by June, adding both sides had been invited to the US for talks next week.\"America proposed for the first time that the two negotiating teams – Ukraine and Russia – meet in the United States of America, probably in Miami, in a week. We confirmed our participation,\" he said.There was no immediate comment from Washington or Moscow, but US President Donald Trump has been pushing for an end for the conflict since he took office again more than a year ago. Meanwhile, Russia has continued its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure - causing further widespread blackouts during freezing conditions.In comments released on Saturday, Zelensky told reporters what had taken place during the second round of US-brokered peace talks in Abu Dhabi, which ended on Friday with no reports of a breakthrough. Zelensky said \"difficult issues remained difficult\", including territorial concessions that Ukraine is under pressure to make.He said the parties discussed, for the first time, the possibility of a trilateral meeting between leaders, not simply representatives, but cautioned \"preparatory elements are needed for this\". Asked whether a time frame had been given for an agreement, the Ukrainian leader replied: \"The Americans say that they want to do everything by June.\" \"Why before this summer?\" he added. \"We understand that their domestic issues in the US will have an impact.\" These issues include the November midterm elections, which could affect the balance of power in the US government.As the diplomacy continues, so too are Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy facilities. \"Russian criminals carried out another massive attack on Ukraine's energy facilities,\" Ukraine's energy minister, Denys Shmyhal, wrote on Telegram. Substations, which control the flow of electricity, and overhead power lines that \"form the backbone of Ukraine's power grid\" were targeted, Shmyhal said. Power plants were also struck.Ukraine's state-owned energy operator, Ukrenergo, said \"the power deficit in the power system of Ukraine significantly increased\" as a result of the latest attacks. Shmyhal said neighbouring Poland had been asked for emergency power supplies.Zelensky wrote on social media that Friday night's attack involved more than 400 drones and 40 missiles. Air-defence systems intercepted most, but not all, of them, the Ukrainian military said.\"The main targets were the energy grid, generation facilities, and distribution substations,\" he said, adding that damage had been reported in at least four regions.In the western region of Lviv, the Dobrotvir power plant came under attack, leaving thousands of people without electricity, according to the regional head, Maksym Kozytskyi. At least 6,000 people were without power as a result of hourly power outage schedules, he added.AFP via Getty ImagesKyiv residents have been sleeping in metro stations to avoid Russian air strikesThe Burshtyn power plant was also struck in the nearby Ivano-Frankivsk region.  DTEK, which runs both the Dobrotvir and Burshtyn plants said it was the tenth \"massive attack\" on its power plants since October 2025.\"In total, DTEK thermal power plants have been attacked by the enemy more than 220 times since the beginning of the full-scale invasion,\" the company added on Telegram. This was launched by Russia nearly four years ago. One person was reported dead in the Rivne region and several were injured in Zaporizhzhia. Rivne's head, Oleksandr Koval, said there was also damage to homes and \"critical infrastructure\".In Kyiv, residents once again took shelter in metro stations. Among them, Oksana Kykhtenko, told the Reuters news agency: \"They [Russians] make us live in inhumane conditions. Without heating, without electricity.\" A drone strike in the city of Yahotyn, about 10km (6.2 miles) away, caused a fire at a warehouse complex, the Ukrainian emergency services said. Ukraine has also attacked Russia, striking a factory that makes missile fuel components in the western Tver region, according to media reports quoting Ukrainian security officials. Further south, in the Saratov region, an oil depot was also hit, Ukraine said. Russia has not commented on any of the latest attacks.  Moscow renewed its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure on Monday after a pause US President Donald Trump had asked Vladimir Putin to observe due to the fierce cold in Ukraine. Trump said the pause lasted for a week until last Sunday but Kyiv disputed the timeline.DTEK said the combined missile and drone strikes caused \"the most powerful blow\" to infrastructure so far this year. \"Moscow must be deprived of the ability to use the cold as leverage against Ukraine,\" Zelensky wrote on X on Saturday, responding to the latest strikes.It is not yet known who was behind the shooting.Some 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Zelensky said earlier this week. The BBC has confirmed the names of almost 160,000 people killed fighting on Russia's side in Ukraine.",

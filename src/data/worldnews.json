    "body": "18 hours agoBethany BellandRachel HaganAn ex-nurse convicted of murdering 10 patients in western Germany may be linked to more than 100 additional deaths, an official has said.The chief public prosecutor in Aachen, Katja Schlenkermann-Pitts, told the BBC  that there was \"a correspondingly high number of suspicious cases\" under review.She cautioned that the cases represented preliminary suspicions and that some could be dismissed following forensic examination.In November last year, a regional court in Aachen convicted the former palliative care nurse, who has not been publicly named, of 10 counts of murder and 27 counts of attempted murder, sentencing him to life imprisonment.The court found that during night shifts at a hospital in Würselen, the man had administered excessive doses of sedatives and painkillers to seriously ill patients without medical justification.Prosecutors said the drugs were sometimes given repeatedly and that the defendant was aware of the potentially fatal consequences. Judges concluded that the actions were driven by personal unease and a desire to impose order during night shifts.The defendant denied the charges during the trial in Aachen, stating that he had intended to help patients sleep and had not believed the medication posed a lethal risk given their underlying illnesses. But prosecutors told the court that he showed \"irritation\" and a lack of empathy to patients who required a higher level of care, and accused him of playing \"master of life and death\".The offences examined in the initial trial occurred between December 2023 and May 2024 at the Rhein-Maas hospital in Würselen, where the nurse had worked since 2020.The newly identified suspected cases relate largely to earlier periods.As part of the expanded inquiry, investigators have ordered around 60 exhumations. Twenty seven have already been carried out, with roughly 30 more pending.Schlenkermann-Pitts said autopsy results were still outstanding in many cases and would determine whether further charges could be brought.\"Of course, they may still be dropped,\" she cautioned.Prosecutors in Cologne are also examining deaths linked to hospitals where the nurse worked before his transfer to Würselen, 65km (40 miles) away.Two exhumations have taken place so far, including the remains of a 94 year old woman who died in 2018, and a 78 year old patient who died in 2015. Further exhumations have been ordered.Prosecutors in both Aachen and Cologne said preparations for potential new charges were under way, but officials said that any further proceedings were unlikely to begin before 2027.The case bears similarity to that of former nurse Niels Högel, who was handed a life sentence in 2019 after he was convicted of murdering 85 patients at two hospitals in northern Germany.Högel is believed to be the most prolific killer in Germany's modern history.",

    "body": "2 hours agoCaroline DaviesPakistan correspondentThe death toll in a fire which engulfed a shopping centre in Pakistan has climbed to 67, police have confirmed.Police say 77 people are currently reported as missing by their families following the fire at Gul Plaza, in Pakistan's largest city Karachi, on Saturday evening.But the scale of the damage following the blaze - which took more than 24 hours to put out - has slowed rescue efforts, as authorities comb the remains of the 6,500sq m (70,000 sq ft) complex.While some of the bodies found are only partial remains, authorities had been able to count 67 skulls, the deputy commissioner of police told the BBC. The process to identify the bodies continues, with 15 people identified so far.Gul Plaza had housed some 1,200 shops, spread across multiple floors. It is wedding season in Karachi, often a particularly busy time of year for shoppers.While the cause of the fire is still unknown, witnesses earlier told the BBC that a lack of working fire exits and the density of shoppers and stalls crammed into the building exacerbated the disaster.Shop owner Rehan Faisal recounted how it only took about \"five to seven minutes\" for everything to \"burn before our eyes\".\"Many customers and shopkeepers were coming up... and saying there was a fire downstairs. I was just beginning to comprehend the situation when the shop owner told me to lock up and get out,\" he told BBC Urdu.With the facility due to close soon, most of the gates of the shopping centre were locked, witnesses said.Senior police official Syed Asad Raza told Reuters news agency that all but three of the centre's 16 exits were locked.",

    "body": "More than 160 million Americans are expected to face an unusually brutal winter storm from Friday, with heavy snows and freezing rains forecast.The storm is expected to sweep through much of the United States, leaving \"extremely dangerous\" conditions in its wake as it tracks eastwards from the High Plains and Rockies, the National Weather Service (NWS) said.It warned that the Arctic blast will bring sub-zero temperatures and wind chills, which \"pose a life-threatening risk of hypothermia and frostbite to exposed skin\".US transportation officials, including airport authorities in several major cities, have warned of weekend travel disruption, delays and cancellations.The winter storm is forecast to move slowly across the US, blanketing cities including Memphis, Nashville, Washington DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York with snow.Heavy snow is predicted through the Southern Rockies and Plains, into the Mid-Atlantic and reaching the Northeast.According to the NWS Probabilistic Precipitation Portal, the regions that could see more than a foot of snow stretch from Colorado to West Virginia to Boston.Numerous low temperature records are likely to be broken, according to the NWS, with the coldest wind chills potentially falling below -50F (-46C) across the Northern Plains. A much wider area of the south-eastern US is also forecast to experience freezing temperatures.Governors in several US states, including Arkansas, Georgia, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina, have declared states of emergency, allowing emergency officials - including National Guard troops - to begin mobilising response efforts.Some airlines have offered passengers the option to change their flights, in some cases without incurring extra fees, due to concerns about cancellations.Motorists should avoid driving across the weekend, with travel expected to be \"nearly impossible during the peak of the storm\", NWS meteorologists Rich Otto and Tony Fracasso told the BBC's US news partner CBS.In Canada, freezing temperatures are already gripping the country, with snowfall expected in eastern and Atlantic regions on Monday, meteorologist Geoff Coulson told CBC earlier in the week.",

    "body": "The United Nations (UN) says it will take over management of a camp in north-eastern Syria holding thousands of people with alleged links to the jihadist group Islamic State (IS).It comes after Kurdish-led forces that had been running the camp withdrew in the face of an advance by Syrian government forces, triggering unrest that forced aid agencies to suspend operations.Residents were reported to have rushed camp perimeters in an apparent attempt to escape, prompting unrest and looting.A ceasefire agreement has brought much of Syria's north-east under the control of Damascus, ending years of autonomous Kurdish rule.Briefing the UN Security Council on Thursday, UN official Edem Wosornu said the UN refugee agency UNHCR had \"taken over camp management responsibilities\" at al-Hol and was working with Syrian authorities to restore humanitarian access. Syrian forces, she said, had established a security perimeter around the camp.However, UN spokesman Stéphane Dujarric cautioned that conditions inside  remained \"tense and volatile\", with humanitarian operations still suspended following the violence.Meanwhile, the US has launched a parallel effort to remove high-risk detainees from the region altogether. US Central Command said on Wednesday that it had begun transferring up to 7,000 suspected IS fighters from prisons in northeast Syria to Iraq, confirming that 150 detainees had already been moved to a \"secure location\" across the border.Iraqi authorities said all transferred detainees would be prosecuted under Iraqi law. \"This is a measure aimed at protecting regional and international security from an imminent threat. Nevertheless, we stress that this issue should not be left to become a long-term strategic burden on Iraq alone,\" Iraq's deputy UN ambassador, Mohammed Sahib Mejid Marzooq, said. Syria's UN ambassador Ibrahim Olabi said the Syrian government welcomed the US operation to transfer IS detainees out of Syrian territory and was ready to offer support.Rights groups have warned that the transfers could expose detainees to serious abuses.The Reprieve charity said it believed up to ten British men could be among those transferred, along with juvenile detainees and urged the UK government to intervene urgently. Around 55 to 60 British nationals, most of them children, remain detained across camps and prisons in the region, it said.\"The prisoners transferred face being tortured, sentenced to death and executed, without being granted any meaningful opportunity to contest the allegations against them\", Katherine Cornett, Reprieve's deputy director told the BBC.The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), US and UN have long called for the repatriation of foreign IS suspects and their families from north-eastern Syria, citing the political instability and dire conditions in the prisons and camps, but many countries have refused to take them.",

    "body": "Japan has suspended operations at the world's largest nuclear power plant, hours after its restart, its operator has said.An alarm sounded \"during reactor-start-up procedures\" at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa north-west of Tokyo but the reactor remained \"stable\", Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) spokesperson Takashi Kobayashi said.Reactor number six restarted on Wednesday a day later than planned due to an alarm malfunction - the first at the plant to be turned on since the 2011 Fukushima disaster.Japan shut down all of its 54 reactors after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake triggered a meltdown at its Fukushima plant 15 years ago, causing one of the worst nuclear disasters in history.At the time, radiation leakage from the plant forced more than 150,000 people to evacuate their homes. Many have not returned despite assurances it is now safe.Following the suspension of reactor number six on Thursday, Kobayashi said it was \"stable and there is no radioactive impact outside\".The reactor was initially set to start on Tuesday, but was pushed back due to a technical issue. It is due to begin operating commercially next month.Kobayashi said Tepco was \"currently investigating the cause\" of the incident and did not say when operations would resume. The seventh reactor at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is not expected to be turned back on until 2030, while the other five could be decommissioned.This would leave the plant with far less capacity than it once had when all seven reactors were operational.Reactor number six was given the green light to restart despite safety concerns from local residents.A small crowd of people gathered outside Tepco's headquarters to protest last week, while hundreds gathered outside the Niigata prefectural assembly in December.Japan was an early adopter of nuclear power - before 2011, nuclear accounted for nearly 30% of its electricity and the country planned to get that up to 50% by 2030.After it was forced to shut them all down in the wake of the Fukushima disaster, it has spent the past decade attempting to revive the plants as part of its goal to reach net zero emissions by 2050.Since 2015, Japan has restarted 15 out of its 33 operable reactors.An earlier version of this story said the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant was in Tokyo and has been corrected to say it is north-west of Tokyo.",

    "body": "France says it has seized an oil tanker in the Mediterranean suspected of being part of Russia's sanction-busting \"shadow fleet\".French President Emmanuel Macron said the tanker, named the Grinch, was \"subject to international sanctions and suspected of flying a false flag\".The French navy, with the assistance of allies including the UK, boarded the vessel on Thursday morning between Spain and Morocco. French maritime authorities said that a search of the vessel had \"confirmed the doubts as to the regularity of the flag\".Russia's embassy in Paris said it had not been informed of the seizure.Moscow's so-called shadow fleet is a clandestine network of tankers used to evade Western sanctions on Russian oil exports by shipping the oil on aged tankers with obscure ownership or insurance.The Grinch was travelling from the Arctic port of Murmansk in northern Russia when it was intercepted, French authorities said. The vessel had been flying a Comoros flag, according to ship tracking websites marinetraffic and vesselfinder.Announcing the seizure on X, Macron said: \"We are determined to uphold international law and to ensure the effective enforcement of sanctions.\"The activities of the \"shadow fleet\" contribute to financing the war of aggression against Ukraine,\" he said, adding that the vessel had been \"diverted\".Defence Secretary John Healy said the UK navy had provided \"tracking and monitoring\" support, with HMS Dagger monitoring the tanker through the Straits of Gibraltar.He added: \"Alongside our allies, we are stepping up our response to shadow vessels to choke off the funds that fuel Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine.\"The UK has imposed sanctions on 544 Russian shadow fleet vessels. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the action, saying it was \"exactly the kind of resolve needed to ensure that Russian oil no longer finances Russia's war\".\"Vessels must be apprehended. And wouldn't it be fair to confiscate and sell the oil carried by these tankers?\" he said on X.Speaking at Davos earlier, Zelensky exhorted Europe to do more to ensure its own security, saying: \"Europe loves to discuss the future but avoids taking action\".Many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Earlier in January, British armed forces supported a US operation to seize a Russian-flagged tanker in the Atlantic that US officials said had broken sanctions by carrying oil for Venezuela and Russia. Moscow denounced the move, saying no state had the right to use force against vessels properly registered in other states' jurisdictions.Last October, France seized another sanctioned tanker, the Boracay, off its west coast before releasing it a few days later.Shadow fleets are becoming increasingly common, with Venezuela, Iran and Russia all accused of using them to avoid sanctions on oil.Financial intelligence firm S&P Global estimates that one in five oil tankers worldwide are used to smuggle oil from sanctioned countries.

I just figured out how to, how to call someone. Uh, uh it's really an emergency.\"When asked by the operator how he knows the woman, he said: \"I don't think these details matter, she's getting beat up but OK fine, also I met her on social media, I don't think that matters.\" The operator responded: \"Can you stop being rude and actually answer my questions?\"Trump was later asked by police to provide a witness statement and said in an email on 2 May that what he saw had been \"very brief indeed but indeed prevalent\".He said he had not expected that his call to the woman would be answered because of the time difference, but it was picked up by \"a shirtless man with darkish hair\".\"This view lasted maybe one second\", he said, adding the view then flipped to the victim getting hit while crying.\"This whole interaction had lasted five to seven seconds.\"He continued: \"I made two of my friends call the Met Police in the UK, even though they are in the US.\"As per evidence I do not have any, I was told by the victim who I am very close with that this individual was giving her difficulty for a long time.\"Rumiantsev denies the charges, which date between November 2024 and January 2025. Prosecutors allege Rumiantsev strangled the woman the evening of 17 January last year.She later called the police, and the Russian national was arrested on the morning of 18 January and taken into custody.The defendant told jurors that the two had been drinking together that night and into the early morning, and had consensual sex during that time.Giving evidence on Thursday, Rumiantsev said an argument broke out and that the woman was \"completely hysterical, crying, screaming, shouting at me\".He said he had held her arms in self-defence to prevent her from hitting him.\"I noticed her phone next to me on the sofa and it was ringing with a Barron Trump face call,\" the defendant told the court.He said he was not sure why he answered the call, but that maybe he hoped \"that she wouldn't behave like this in front of someone else.\" Earlier, the Russian national told the court that he learned about the woman's friendship with Trump in October 2024 - when she asked him to take a photograph of a chat between them on her phone. The court also heard he and the alleged victim had had a disagreement in November 2024.Rumiantsev said that he had felt \"upset\" about her talking to Trump.But he said: \"I was in no way controlling but I was trying to make her know that if she feels unwell seeing messages I had with girls 10 years ago, she could maybe understand how I felt when she was sat there this moment texting someone else.\"The trial continues.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "Mandela's prison key, sunglasses and shirt can be sold after daughter wins court battleA South African court has dismissed an appeal by the country's heritage body to stop the sale and export of various artefacts connected to anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela.The 70 personal items include a cell key from Robben Island, where Mandela was imprisoned for 18 of the 27 years he was locked up, a pair of Aviator sunglasses and one of his signature floral shirts. They were due to be exported to the US for auction.The objects belong to his eldest daughter, Makaziwe Mandela and Christo Brand, a Robben Island warden during Mandela's incarceration. In trying to stop their sale, the authorities said they were part of the country's heritage and were therefore legally protected from export.The South African Heritage Resources Agency (Sahra) first found out about the potential sale in a British newspaper article from late 2021, claiming that the key would go for more than £1m ($1.35m).The agency then wrote to the US auction house, Guernsey, that was planning the sale to ask it to suspend the auction and return the assets to South Africa.Other items in the lot were a copy of the 1996 South African Constitution personally signed by Mandela, one of his charcoal drawings, an ID card, a tennis racquet he used on Robben Island and gifts from world leaders, including one from former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle.Mandela's daughter wanted to use the proceeds from the sale to build a memorial garden at the late former resident's grave in Qunu, in Mthatha, Eastern Cape province.In its ruling, the Supreme Court of Appeal argues that Sahra's interpretation of what items fell under the National Heritage Resources Act was overly broad.The ruling also states that whereas Makaziwe and Brand explained in detail why their respective assets were not heritage objects, Sahra made no attempt to explain on what grounds it believed they were.It is not yet clear whether the authorities will seek other legal avenues to block the sale. The BBC has contacted the sport, arts and culture department for comment.Makaziwe, Mandela's only daughter with his first wife, welcomed the Supreme Court's judgment, blasting the heritage agency for presuming \"to know my father's last wishes better than those who were beside him at the end - his family\".\"Nobody is more invested in ensuring Tata's [Mandela's] legacy endures in the way he would want to be remembered than those who carry his name,\" she said.She added that no decision had yet been made on what would happen to the items meant to go on auction.Some supporters of the government's position argued that items connected to Mandela should not be sold or exported but instead kept in South Africa for future generations.Others believe that Mandela's family should decide what happens to the objects.Mandela died in 2013 at the age of 95. He led the African National Congress in its struggle against apartheid - a system of legally enforced racism - and was released from prison in 1990.He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 along with then-President FW de Klerk.Mandela became South Africa's first democratically elected president in 1994.",

    "body": "1 day agoVanessa BuschschlüterLatin America editor, BBC News OnlineRafael Tudares, the son-in-law of Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo González, has been released from prison, his wife has said, more than a year after he was detained as part of a crackdown on Maduro government critics and their relatives.Mariana González said her husband had returned home after \"380 days of unjust and arbitrary detention\".Tudares is one of more than 150 detainees who have been released since the US military seized Venezuelan leader, Nicolás Maduro, in a nighttime raid and took him to New York to stand trial on drug-trafficking charges.An NGO lobbying for the release of Venezuelan political prisoners warns that 777 still remain behind bars.Tension within the country remains high with Maduro's former vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, now in power having been sworn in as the acting president.Her interim government has received the backing of US President Donald Trump, who has praised Rodríguez for agreeing to \"turn over\" up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil to the US.The release of political prisoners had been among the first things the Trump administration had pushed Venezuela's interim government to do.Just five days after the US raid, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly announced that \"an important number of people\" would be freed as \"a gesture of peace\".However, rights groups have denounced the slow pace of the releases and the fact that the number given by officials - 400 - falls far short of what they have been able to confirm. The NGO Foro Penal says it has so far only been able to verify the release of 151 political prisoners since 8 January, when the head of Venezuela's National Assembly announced that \"an important number of people\" would be freed as \"a gesture of peace\" following the US operation.Foro Penal has also said that many those released have not had the charges against them dropped, leaving them in legal limbo, and have been barred from speaking in public. Tudares's imprisonment was one of the emblematic cases of the repression which followed in the wake of Venezuela's 2024 presidential election.His father-in-law, González, became the main challenger of the incumbent Maduro after the well-known opposition leader María Corina Machado was barred from running.Fearing the Maduro government would resort to fraud to rig the result, González and Machado mobilised hundreds of people to act as observers at the polling stations and collect the tallies from the electronic voting machines. The electoral council, dominated by government loyalists, declared Maduro the winner but never provided the detailed voting tallies to back up its claim.The voting tallies collected by the observers deployed by the opposition and independently verified by the Carter Center, however, suggested that González had won by a landslide. Nevertheless, Maduro - who was firmly in control of the state institutions, including the armed forces and the police - was sworn in for another term in January 2025.In the run-up to his inauguration, many opposition leaders and activists were seized by the security forces in an attempt to stifle any dissent.Fearing arrest, González had sought refuge in the Dutch embassy as early as September 2024 and gone in to exile in Spain shortly afterwards.Three days before Maduro's inauguration, González's 46-year-old son-in-law - a lawyer who was not involved in politics - was seized by hooded men as he was taking his young children to see their ailing grandmother. For months, his family did not know where he was being held or on what grounds he had been seized.Last month, his wife said she had learned that he had been sentenced to 30 years in prison for \"terrorism and conspiracy\". She said her access was not allowed to choose a lawyer and had only been allowed to read the charges levelled against him on the day of his \"only hearing\".Mariana González told El Pais newspaper that she had been approached on at least three occasions by middlemen who told her that her husband would only be allowed to return to his family if her father renounced his cause. \"This has nothing to do with justice,\" she said at the time. \"Being the son-in-law of Edmundo González is not a crime,\" she added.Mariana González took to X to thank all of the people who had supported her in her fight for her husband's release. But she also reminded readers that there were still many families waiting for the release of their loved ones who, she said, had been \"forcibly disappeared, arbitrarily detained and unjustly locked up.Many of them have been holding vigils outside the main prisons in Venezuela in the hope that their relatives will be among those released in the wake of the US military raid.",

    "body": "2 hours agoBalla Satish,HyderabadandAbhishek Dey,GuwahatiAuthorities in the southern Indian state of Telangana have launched an investigation after hundreds of stray dogs were killed across at least six villages in the past month.Police say they have confirmed at least 354 killings so far and arrested nine people in connection with some of the cases.Animal welfare activists have told the BBC that the dogs were either poisoned or given lethal injections, but police say they are waiting for forensic reports to establish the method used.Villagers have said that the killings were linked to promises made by candidates during recent local election campaigns to get rid of stray dogs and monkeys.The killings have come at a time when India is witnessing a larger debate about stray animals and the country's top court is hearing petitions about how to rid the city streets, including in the capital Delhi, of stray dogs. But killings on such a large scale are rare and have elicited outrage. Stray animals - mostly dogs but also cattle and monkeys - are considered a persistent problem in many parts of India, where they are often blamed for attacks on people, crop damage and traffic accidents.The problem is attributed to a combination of factors, including gaps in sterilisation and vaccination programmes, rubbish piling up, abandonment of animals, shrinking forest habitats and uneven enforcement of laws. While stray dogs, in particular, are often enmeshed in the fabric of daily life, forming strong bonds with local communities, animal rights activists have frequently flagged cruelty towards them, warning that the country does not have strong enough penalties. Telangana state minister Danasari Anasuya Seethakka told the Hindu newspaper that the killings were \"illegal\" and \"inhumane\", warning that those responsible would face strict action.The issue of how to handle stray dogs is also being debated at present in the Supreme Court.In August last year, the court ordered authorities in Delhi and its suburbs to move all stray dogs from streets to animal shelters in just two months. After widespread protests, the court modified the order, asking for the animals to be immunised and vaccinated before being released back to their neighbourhoods.Animal welfare groups argue that putting dogs into already-overburdened shelters is unscientific, while those seeking removal of stray dogs from public places say unchecked populations is endangering people's lives and livelihoods.The killings in Telangana were spread across three districts and occurred between late December and mid-January. Police say they may have taken place over several days in each location.In Kamareddy district, \"244 dogs died and were buried in four locations\", S Anil, a police sub-inspector, told BBC Telugu. \"Government veterinary doctors have conducted post-mortems and sent samples to the lab,\" said Anil, adding that council heads of three villages were found to be involved.In Shayampet and Arepally villages near Telangana's Warangal city, police say 110 dogs were killed. Police sub-inspector J Parameshwar told BBC Telugu that nine people, including village council heads, have been arrested.In Jagtial city, police are investigating a complaint that around 40 dogs were killed on 28 and 30 December but no bodies had been recovered so far.Minister Seethakka told the Hindu newspaper that killing stray dogs under the pretext of population control could not be justified under any circumstances.The government has issued clear instructions to all village councils to prevent a recurrence of such incidents, she added.Animal welfare activists allege that the number of dogs that have been culled is much higher than what the police have confirmed so far.Some residents, however, have defended the killings.Raju (who goes by just his first name), the son of the Arepally village head, told the BBC that only rabid dogs were killed, saying they were diseased, aggressive and had caused road accidents and serious injuries. Another resident, Vijay (goes by first name), said most villagers supported the decision, citing fears of dog bites and disease.Telangana recorded nearly 122,000 dog bite cases in 2024, according to federal government records, but no dog bite-related rabies deaths were recorded in the same period.The dog killings have coincided with other alleged incidents involving stray animals in Telangana, including a case reported by The Times of India in which several monkeys were found dead or critically injured after being allegedly tranquillised and dumped along a highway in Kamareddy district.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",

    "body": "1 day agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterUbisoft has cancelled six video games - including its long-awaited Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake - as part of a \"major reset\" of its operations.The French developer and publisher, known for popular games such as Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Just Dance, has closed two studios and delayed seven titles as part of its changes.Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot said the move would \"create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth\".The firm's shares plunged by 33% on Thursday morning following the announcement.The move comes at a time when studios are increasingly turning to video game remakes and remasters, with new versions of Super Mario Galaxy, Oblivion and Metal Gear Solid 3 proving popular in 2025.So the decision to bin the remake of Sands of Time - which sold millions of copies in 2003 - has left many fans scratching their heads.Ubisoft has not specified which titles it has discontinued alongside the Prince of Persia remake.But it says among them are four unannounced titles, including three based on new intellectual property, and a mobile game.Ubisoft has closed its studios in Stockholm, Sweden and Halifax, Canada as part of the move, which will include restructuring three others.The developers were working on a new intellectual property (IP) and mobile titles for Assassin's Creed, respectively.The closure of Ubisoft Halifax was previously announced in January - the same week the studio formed a union.  \"While these decisions are difficult, they are necessary for us to build a more focused, efficient and sustainable organisation over the long term,\" Guillemot said.\"Taken together, these measures mark a decisive turning point for Ubisoft and reflect our determination to confront challenges head-on to reshape the Group for the long term\".Gaming industry analyst Piers Harding-Rolls told the BBC the move indicated the firm was trying to mitigate risk.\"It's less risky to maintain scale by investing in existing big franchises such as Assassin's Creed and Rainbow Six than launch entirely new IPs and that's reflected in the cancellation of a number of games based on new IPs,\" he said.It is the second restructure from Ubisoft in subsequent years, after the firm cut 185 jobs across Europe in 2025.In the UK, it closed its office in Leamington and restructured another in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.Guillemot said the new move was in part due to a competitive market for triple-A games - blockbuster titles which cost millions to develop and dominate large studios' offerings.\"On the one hand, the triple-A industry has become persistently more selective and competitive with rising development costs and greater challenges in creating brands,\" he said in a statement on Wednesday.Such big offerings are increasingly facing delays - with Grand Theft Auto VI pushed back for a second time to November 2026.But Guillemot said despite these hurdles, successful blockbuster games could bring \"more financial potential than ever\".\"In this context, today we are announcing a major reset built to create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth over time,\" he said.Ubisoft will now focus on developing open world adventure games - which let players freely navigate vast environments - and live service games which seek regular payments from players.The firm said its subsidiary Vantage Studios, created after a €1.25bn ($1.25bn; £1bn) investment from Chinese tech giant Tencent, would aim to turn Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six \"into annual billionaire brands\".",

    "body": "Outrage after Indian man drowns in open pit after begging for help for hours1 day agoCherylann MollanMumbaiBBCYuvraj Mehta's body was recovered hours after he fell into a waterlogged pit in NoidaThe death of a 27-year-old Indian IT professional after his car fell into an unmarked construction pit has raised questions around urban planning and road safety in India.Last Friday, at around midnight, Yuvraj Mehta was driving home in Noida, a suburb of the capital Delhi, through dense winter fog when his car reportedly hit a low boundary wall and plunged into the deep pit full of water. The site had reportedly been dug up a few years ago before work was stalled.Mehta, who didn't know how to swim, climbed on to the roof of his car as it began to sink and rang his father who rushed to the scene and alerted the emergency services. His father told reporters that Mehta remained there for close to two hours, flashing the torch on his phone and shouting for help.Then, his cries stopped. By the time authorities recovered his body, almost five hours had passed since the accident, local media reported.Mehta's tragic death has made national headlines, and the fact that it happened so close to the capital city has shocked and angered residents. Protests have been held at the accident site, with demonstrators accusing authorities of negligence and demanding accountability.His death has also fuelled larger questions about the state of Indian roads and urban planning.\"Noida techie's [Mehta's] death is essentially a murder. Dreams shattered. Hard work gone in vain. Father's hopes buried. All because of a failed system,\" one user wrote on X.\"This tragedy raises deeper questions about the quality of infrastructure in even big cities like Noida,\" said another.Some users shared their own experiences of accidents because of bad roads, lack of adequate signage and poor lighting after dark. Some also complained about open drains and construction sites on roads close to their homes becoming death traps, especially for children and the elderly.ANIAfter the accident, police have erected barricades near the construction pitSince the accident, police in Noida have registered two cases against the real estate developers of the construction site where the pit was located following a complaint from Mehta's family.On Sunday, the government of Uttar Pradesh state, where Noida is located, removed a senior official from the township's governing authority and ordered an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the rescue operation and site safety.Since then, police have arrested Abhay Kumar, one of the owners of the construction site, for alleged culpable homicide due to negligence under India's criminal code. Kumar is in custody and has not commented on the allegations.Police have said that further investigations are under way and that more arrests are likely in the coming days.In media interviews, Mehta's father Rajkumar has said that he received a call from his son soon after the accident happened. He rushed to the spot but said that the site was pitch dark and shrouded in fog, and that his son was barely visible in the murky waters.He alerted the police and the fire brigade and said that rescue teams arrived at the site shortly after. But he alleged that his son remained stranded for hours because they did not have the resources to pull him out. He added that his son's life could have been saved if trained divers were sent to retrieve him, but that did not happen. \"He was constantly saying, 'Papa mujhe bacha lo' [Papa save me] during his last hours,\" Rajkumar Mehta told NDTV news channel.Getty ImagesMany roads in India are in a bad shapeMoninder, who goes by one name and is a delivery worker for an e-commerce platform, was passing by and reportedly made a brave attempt to save Mehta. He tied a rope around his waist and jumped into the freezing water to pull him out, he told Hindustan Times newspaper..He added that he searched for Mehta for 30-40 minutes but couldn't locate him. He also alleged that emergency responders weren't willing to step inside the water, saying that it was too cold and that there were iron rods inside the pit.Noida's additional commissioner of police Rajeev Narain Mishra told the media that the incident was \"unfortunate\" but denied negligence.\"Police and fire department teams made efforts to save the youth. A fire department crane, ladder, makeshift boat and searchlights were used, but there was zero visibility at the time,\" he told Times of India newspaper and added that further investigation was under way.Hemant Upadhyay, assistant commissioner of police for Noida, told British newspaper The Independent that no-one was sent into the pit because officers were concerned about further casualties if untrained personnel were sent in.\"The water was very deep, visibility was poor and there were concerns about submerged debris,\" he said.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "1 day agoKelly NgWatch: Footage captures moment landslide starts in Mount Maunganui in New ZealandTwo people have died and several are feared buried after landslides in New Zealand's North Island.The deaths were reported at Welcome Bay, while rescue workers are still searching through rubble at a different site in a popular campground on Mount Maunganui. There are no \"signs of life\", authorities said, adding that they have a \"rough idea\" of how many people are missing but are waiting for an exact figure. They provided no other details except that the group includes \"at least one young girl\".The landslides were triggered by heavy rains over the last few days, which led to flooding and power outages across the North Island. One minister said the east coast resembled \"a war zone\".New Zealand is \"heavy with grief\" after the \"profound tragedy\" caused by recent weather, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said on X.Footage from the campsite on Mount Maunganui, an extinct volcano, shows a huge slip near the base of the volcanic dome, as rescuers and sniffer dogs comb through crushed caravans and flattened tents.Authorities said that the search would continue through the night. \"This is a complex and high-risk environment, and our teams are working to achieve the best possible outcome while keeping everyone safe,\" said Megan Stiffler, the deputy national commander for the Urban Search and Rescue team,The extinct volcano is a sacred Māori site and one of the most popular campgrounds in New Zealand, with a local holiday website describing it as a \"slice of paradise\". But it has been repeatedly hit by landslides in recent years.\"I heard this huge tree crack and all this dirt come off, and then I looked behind me and there's this huge landslide coming down,\" Australian tourist Sonny Worrall told local broadcaster TVNZ.\"I'm still shaking from it now... I turned around and had to jump out of my seat and just run,\"he added. He saw it happen while swimming in a hot pool.Hiker Mark Tangney told the New Zealand Herald he heard people screaming from under the rubble. \"So I just parked up and ran to help... We could hear people screaming: 'Help us, help us, get us out of here',\" he said.Those calls persisted for about half an hour and then went silent, Tangney said.TVNZRescue work will continue through the night, officials say A surf club in another part of Mount Maunganui has been evacuated following fears of more landslides.A state of emergency has been declared in the Bay of Plenty where Mount Maunganui sits, and various parts of the North Island, including Northland, Coromandel, Tairāwhiti and Hauraki.Several areas reported their wettest days on record on Thursday. Tauranga in the Bay of Plenty, for example, received three months worth of rain within a day, according to local media.Some 8,000 people were without power as of Thursday morning, Radio New Zealand (RNZ) reported.The wife of a man who was swept away in the Mahurangi River is holding out hope that he will survive. \"I know his personality is strong, wise,\" she told RNZ, adding that he was a fisherman back home in Kiribati and knew how to swim and dive.The man, 47, was driving to work with their nephew when the car they were in fell into the river. He had pushed the nephew towards a branch so the nephew could hoist himself onto land; but the older man did not manage get back up himself, according to the report.\"It's been a very big event for us as a country, really hitting almost our entire eastern seaboard of the North Island,\" said Minister for Emergency Management Mark Mitchell. \"The good news is that everyone responded really quickly, and there was time to get prepared. That helps to mitigate and create a very strong response,\" he told RNZ.December to February are typically the sunnier months in New Zealand but in recent years heavy rains and storms have become more frequent.In February 2023, parts of the island were devastated by Cyclone Gabrielle, which is to date the costliest cyclone to hit the Southern Hemisphere, with damage amounting to NZ$13.5bn ($7.9bn; £5.9bn). This week's flooding has added to the toll for the local communities that are still rebuilding.Additional reporting by Vandhna Bhan and Koh Ewe",

    "body": "4 hours agoSuranjana TewariAsia Business Correspondent, SingaporeGetty ImagesOne in seven people in the world use TikTok. Yet for the company behind such a cultural phenomenon, the last few years have been a rollercoaster.Concerns over the app first surfaced more than five years ago, prompting President Trump, in his first term, to sign an executive order aimed at removing TikTok from US stores.Lawmakers were worried that the Chinese government could access user data of the 200 million Americans who use the app and possibly manipulate their feeds.To address these concerns, TikTok's parent company ByteDance launched Project Texas – storing US user data on domestic servers run by American-owned Oracle. The company also moved its headquarters to Singapore and Los Angeles – in part to distance itself from its Chinese roots.These were seen as significant concessions at the time. But still, in 2024 Congress passed a law threatening to ban the app outright, unless ByteDance transferred majority ownership and changed how TikTok operates in the US.That deal has now closed with ByteDance signing an agreement to split the US app from the rest of its global business under a new consortium of companies that includes Oracle.TikTok remains alive in a critical market, but the terms underline the compromises and limits that ByteDance - and perhaps other Chinese tech firms - may face as they try to expand globally.How did we get here?The US-China rivalry has seen Washington and Beijing crack down on each other's firms over national security concerns.Yet in the the most recent trade war TikTok became \"low hanging fruit\" that China could offer in exchange for other important concessions, like American agricultural products.The deal allows China to frame the outcome as a win - exporting tech on its own terms while gaining leverage in broader trade negotiations.ByteDance will retain access to America's 200 million users and 7.5 million businesses, but it loses control over TikTok's algorithm and data.Instead, the company will licence the algorithm to the new US entity, in a deal the Trump administration has valued at $14bn (£10bn).\"TikTok's power lies in its content graph - an algorithm that learns from thousands of user signals to deliver hyper‑relevant, highly addictive videos,\" said Kelsey Chickering, principal analyst at Forrester.\"With a US joint venture retraining that algorithm on domestic data, the experience will change... One thing's certain: TikTok in America won't be the same.\"This shift could have knock on effects for advertisers and creators because of the changes. Creators may see their engagement shrink especially because global virality will take a hit – previously content that took off in one region could become popular in the US organically. A US-only algorithm could weaken that, forcing brands to re-structure deals and perhaps having to pay more for US exposure.TikTok's global revenue was estimated to be $20-26bn in 2024, roughly $10 billion of which came from the US with advertising accounting for a large share.The changes will likely hurt TikTok's bottom line in the US, but ByteDance retains a 19.9% stake and therefore a share of the profits.The retraining of the algorithm might also have consequences for ByteDance's technology development.Running separate US and global algorithms, split workforces, and parallel governance adds engineering costs, slows innovation, and adds to the operational complexity, says Charlie Dai Principal Analyst in Technology Architecture & Delivery at Forrester.The India experienceByteDance has faced political and regulatory hurdles before.The loss of India in 2020 - then TikTok's largest market, with 200 million users - was a far bigger setback than any potential disruption in the US, says Chris Stokel-Walker, author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World's Favourite App.But, he says, even the India \"setback\" wasn't much of a setback. \"They've continued to show growth despite these challenges.\"The struggles in both the US and India share a common thread: they were triggered by geopolitical tensions.The India ban, however, was not aimed at TikTok alone - it targeted China more broadly, with roughly 200 apps blocked across the country. And while that ban opened the door for homegrown platforms to emerge, none have come close to matching TikTok's success.Getty ImagesTikTok CEO Shou Chew will be a director in the new US ventureFor some, the TikTok deal inevitably invites comparisons with Huawei – another Chinese tech champion whose global ambitions have been reshaped by geopolitics.But there are stark differences, Huawei has been effectively locked out of Western markets after US sanctions cut off access to critical 5G infrastructure.TikTok by contrast has been allowed to remain, albeit on restrictive terms for ByteDance.Chris Stokel-Walker says this reflects a shift in how governments are responding to Chinese technology companies.Some are excluded altogether; others are permitted to operate, but only within tightly defined political and regulatory limits.A homegrown championWhile TikTok is being reshaped abroad, it has full control over Douyin – its Chinese sister app – which is hugely successful in its own right within China.Douyin forms a core pillar of ByteDance's business – it is profitable, politically aligned and able to innovate because it is in charge of training the algorithm on data it has full access to.But ByteDance is also hedging its bets for the future, investing in data centres, the cloud and Artificial Intelligence, underscoring the company's efforts to diversify beyond advertising-led consumer apps.Chris Stokel-Walker argues that TikTok's predicament is no longer really about data security, but about who controls speech, culture and influence in the US.Trump has never liked that China might be shaping American culture, he says.The reality is that ByteDance will continue to operate TikTok in the US, but with distinct limitations. And this could spill over into other markets it plans to expand in with regulators looking for more control over Chinese technology.Other experts have said the licensing aspect of the deal could form a template for how other Chinese tech companies expand globally in an environment of increasing mistrust of Beijing.",

    "body": "US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers detained a five-year-old boy on Tuesday during an immigration enforcement operation, Minnesota school officials and the family's lawyer have said.Pre-schooler Liam Ramos was with his father - named by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias - when Conejo Arias was approached by agents on his driveway. In a statement posted on X, the DHS said \"ICE did NOT target a child\", but was conducting an operation against his father, an \"illegal alien\" who \"abandoned\" his son when approached.Zena Stenvik, the Columbia Heights Public Schools superintendent, asked: \"Why detain a five-year-old? \"You can't tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal.\"In a post on X, ICE denied the child had been detained.\"A criminal illegal alien ABANDONED his child as he fled from ICE officers, and our officers ensured the child was kept SAFE in the bitter cold,\" the agency said. \"ICE made multiple attempts to get the family inside the house to take custody of the child. \"They refused to accept custody of the child. The father told officers he wanted the child to remain with him.\"DHS did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.Photos provided to the BBC by the school district show a boy, identified as Liam Ramos, wearing a bunny-shaped winter hat, standing outside as an officer holds on to his backpack.The Columbia Heights Public Schools authority described these as bystander photos. The district did not identify the individuals who took the pictures, referring to them as \"known and confirmed community members\".Marc Prokosch, a lawyer representing the family, told a press conference on Thursday that Liam and his father were being held at a detention centre in San Antonio, Texas, and attorneys were trying to contact them. Prokosch said the boy and his father had come to the US in 2024 from Ecuador to seek asylum. \"This family was not eluding ICE in any way,\" he said. \"They were following all the established protocols.\"School officials said an agent asked the child to knock on the door of the home to see if anyone else was there.The boy had just arrived home from pre-school at the time, Stenvik told the press conference.She said another adult living in the home asked to take the young boy inside, but was refused. School board member Mary Granlund said she was on the scene and told immigration officials she could take Liam Ramos, but they still detained him. US Vice-President JD Vance, who visited Minnesota on Thursday amid ongoing protests against immigration enforcement, told reporters ICE had no choice because \"the father ran\". \"What are they supposed to do?\" he said of ICE agents. \"Are they supposed to let a five-year-old child freeze to death? \"Are they not supposed to arrest an illegal alien in the United States of America?\"He added: \"If the argument is that you can't arrest people who have violated laws because they have children. . . that doesn't make any sense.\"Watch: Father and 5-year-old \"did everything right\" in asylum process, says family attorneyStenvik said that ICE had recently detained a total of four students in her school district, including a 10-year-old, and two 17-year-olds.\"The onslaught of ICE activity in our community is inducing trauma,\" Stenvik told reporters. The DHS maintains it is arresting the \"worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens\" in an effort to restore public safety in Minnesota.At a DHS press conference on Tuesday, Gregory Bovino of the US Border Patrol said: \"Our operations are lawful, are targeted, and are focused on individuals who pose a serious threat to this community.\"The immigration enforcement initiative, dubbed Operation Metro Surge, has sparked outcry from residents in Minneapolis, St Paul and other cities in the state.On 7 January, a federal officer fatally shot a woman named Renee Good in Minneapolis, sparking protests and condemnation from local and state officials.The Trump administration alleged the 37-year-old was using her vehicle as a weapon and the officer acted in self-defence.Also on Thursday, seven Democrats in the US House of Representatives voted with Republicans to narrowly pass $1.2tn (£900bn) in funding for government agencies, including ICE. The measure - which would allocate $64.4bn to DHS, including $10bn for ICE - was approved 220-207. It must still pass the Senate.Democrats who voted in favour said they did so to fund the Transportation Security Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agency, both under DHS. ",

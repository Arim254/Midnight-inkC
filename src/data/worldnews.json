    "body": "Thirteen people were injured, two critically, after a car crashed into a crowd during a demolition derby in southeastern Australia, police said.The car had been taking part in a race in the town of Walcha on Saturday night when it drove through a fence and hit the grandstand, New South Wales police said in a statement.The race, part of the annual Walcha Motorcycle Rally, had been a demolition derby - a type of motorsport where drivers ram their vehicles into one another.Brendan Moylan, a member of parliament for Northern Tablelands, the region where Walcha is located, said on social media on Sunday that nine people remained in hospital and \"all are now recovering\".Earlier, police put the number of injured at nine. They said the ages of the injured bystanders ranged from 20 to 75, while a critically injured person was a 54-year-old man. An investigation was under way, they said.Police said they were told that the 27-year-old driver of the car had been involved in a collision on the track right before it drove into the fence.In a statement published on the Walcha Motorcycle Rally's Facebook page, the Walcha Council said that it was \"shocked and stunned at the unfortunate accident\".The Council said it would work with authorities to \"examine the circumstances which led to the accident\". Giving any comments before concluding the inquiries would be \"inappropriate\", it said.In a post on Facebook, Moylan thanked emergency responders and other bystanders for their \"swift and incredibly professional work at the scene\". \"My thoughts are with everyone affected,\" he wrote.Barnaby Joyce, former deputy prime minister and incumbent New England lawmaker, wrote on Facebook that his \"thoughts, prayer and hopes\" were with those injured in the crash.\"Such a sad end to such a great event,\" he wrote.The Walcha Motorcycle Rally describes itself as a \"grassroots event for motorcycle enthusiasts\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondentChile's presidential election will go to a run-off vote in December between a Communist Party and a far-right candidate, after the first round on Sunday produced no outright winner.The election campaign was dominated by crime and immigration, as migration to the country has grown in recent years and candidates pledged to fight foreign gangs like Venezuela's Tren de Aragua.The Communist Party's Jeannette Jara, from the governing coalition, narrowly won the first round followed closely by far-right candidate José Antonio Kast.The result is expected to give a boost to Kast, as Jara was the only left-wing candidate running against several right-wing candidates, which split the right-wing vote.In the 14 December run-off, voters will have to coalesce around one of these two candidates.Kast is expected to pick up votes from other candidates who did not make the final two, including the centre-right senator Evelyn Matthei and the radical libertarian congressman Johannes Kaiser. If this happens, it would make Chile the latest country in Latin America to shift to the right.Kast is a conservative lawyer and former congressman who lost the 2021 election's run-off to President Gabriel Boric. This is his third time running for president.The father of nine has promoted a tough crackdown on immigration including a Trump-style \"border wall\", opposes abortion even in cases of rape, has criticised environmental and indigenous activism, and wants to shrink the state. His brother was a minister during Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship and his father was a member of the Nazi party.Speaking on election night, he said Chile needed to avoid \"continuity of a very bad government. Perhaps the worst government in the democratic history of Chile.\"Jara is a member of the Communist Party but many see her as centre-left in practice. She was a minister in President Boric's government and her platform has included pledging to increase lithium production, raising the minimum wage, building new prisons and deploying the army to protect Chile's borders.As results were coming through, she said: \"Democracy in our country must be taken care of and valued. And it costs us a lot to recover it, today it is at risk.\"Both candidates talked up their pledges to tackle crime and immigration, as organised crime and kidnappings having risen in the country.Chile's foreign population has grown since 2017. The National Migration Service said in December 2023 it reached more than 1.9 million people. Official estimates suggest at least 330,000 are undocumented migrants living illegally in the country, many from Venezuela.Kast has blamed rising crime on immigration, although several studies suggest that those born abroad commit fewer crimes on average than Chileans.Chile, perceived as more prosperous and safe compared to some other Latin American nations, is a desirable destination for migrants in the region, and for those returning from the US after President Trump's migration crackdown.Kast has pledged to build ditches along Chile's northern border with Peru and Bolivia, as well as mass deportations of undocumented migrants and people who entered the country illegally. He has also promised new maximum-security prisons, like those that have been built in El Salvador.Jara has promised to build new prisons and expel foreigners convicted of drug trafficking.This election was the first time that all eligible voters were automatically registered to vote, and voting was compulsory in Chile.",

    "body": "10 hours agoDanai Nesta KupembaBBC NewsFederal agents have descended on the city of Charlotte in North Carolina as part of US President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has said.Federal immigration authorities carried out nearly 100 arrests in the Charlotte area on Saturday, according to CBS, the BBC's American news partner.Local officials, including Mayor of Charlotte Vi Lyles, released a joint statement criticising the operation, saying it was causing \"unnecessary fear and uncertainty\" in the community.Since Trump's return to office he has deployed troops to Washington DC, Los Angeles and Chicago to deliver on his promise of \"the largest deportation programme\" in US history.The DHS announced \"Operation Charlotte's Web\" on Saturday, saying \"criminal illegal aliens\" would be targeted in the Democratic-run city.\"We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,\" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said.Armoured vehicles and special operations teams could be involved in the North Charlotte crackdown, according to internal government documents seen by the BBC's US partner, CBS News. Several church members doing yard work at a church in east Charlotte fled into woods when agents arrived and detained one man, The Charlotte Observer reported, quoting the church's pastor. \"We thought church was safe and nothing [was] gonna happen,\" a 15-year-old witness told the newspaper.Officials said there are \"a number of organisations standing ready to assist individuals seeking legal guidance on immigration matters\".The DHS said they are carrying out the operation because North Carolina has not honoured the nearly 1,400 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees - meaning they had been released due to \"sanctuary policies\".Charlotte is not a sanctuary city - cities that have policies in place to limit the assistance given to federal immigration authorities - but it is a \"certified welcoming city\". This is a formal designation for cities that are committed to immigration inclusion.  \"President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem will step up to protect Americans when sanctuary politicians won't,\" the DHS said.Charlotte is an ethnically diverse city, with about 17% of residents being born outside of the country, according to Data US. DHS has not said how long the raids will last. Chicago's crackdown, which began in September is still ongoing. Earlier in the week, US Representative and Democrat, Alma Adams, said she was informed of the operation and was \"extremely concerned\" about Border Patrol and ICE agents coming to North Carolina. The next city on Trump's list is set to be New Orleans, according to CBS, and that as many as 200 agents could be deployed to the city. Operations in previous cities like Chicago and Los Angeles have come under fire over concerns of excessive use of force.",

Police protecting the compound used tear gas on the crowds.Authorities have arrested 20 people for crimes including robbery and assault, Mexico City security chief Pablo Vazquez told reporters.Protesters waved banners displaying messages including \"We are all Carlos Manzo\", while others wore cowboy hats in tribute to him.EPAManzo was shot on 1 November while he attended a Day of the Dead festival.He was known for speaking openly about drug-trafficking gangs in his town and cartel violence. He had been demanding tough action against armed cartel members who terrorise the country. Sheinbaum has been acting against cartels but resisting calls for another all-out war on drugs. Previous attempts by her predecessors have ended with bloody results.Days before the march took place, the president said the demonstration was being promoted by bots online.\"We agree with freedom of expression and freedom of demonstration if there are young people who have demands, but the issue here is who is promoting the demonstration,\" she said in a briefing. \"People should know how this demonstration was organised so that no one is used.\"ReutersSome protesters paid tribute to Uruapan mayor Carlos ManzoSheinbaum retains approval ratings above 70% in her first year in office, and has made in-roads in clamping down on fentanyl-trafficking – a key issue for her US counterpart, Donald Trump.But she has been criticised for failing to halt the violence gripping the country and is facing increased hostility from nearby countries.Earlier this month, Peru's Congress voted to declare Sheinbaum a persona non grata - or unwelcome in the country.The decision came days after Peru severed diplomatic ties with Mexico, after the Mexican government granted asylum to a former Peruvian prime minister facing charges for a 2022 coup attempt.",

    "body": "2 days agoDanielle Kaye,Business reporter and Nardine SaadUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order allowing a range of food products, including coffee, bananas and beef, to escape his sweeping tariffs.The move comes as his administration faces mounting pressure over rising prices. While Trump previously downplayed concerns about the cost of living, he has focused on the issue since his Republican Party's poor performance in last week's elections.The dozens of products included on the White House's list of exemptions range from avocados and tomatoes to coconuts and mangoes.These goods, the Trump administration said on Friday, cannot be produced in sufficient quantities domestically.Trump has long said that his tariffs - currently a baseline 10% on imports from all countries, with additional levies on many trading partners - would not lead to increased prices for US consumers. He also said affordability was a \"new word\" and a \"con job\" by Democrats.He has argued the taxes are necessary to reduce the US trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods it buys from other countries and those it sells to them. Trump has said the US has been exploited by \"cheaters\" and \"pillaged\" by foreigners, adding that higher levies would encourage those in the US to buy American goods instead. But grocery costs and the soaring price of beef has become a political issue for Trump. Last week, he called for an investigation into the meat-packing industry, accusing companies of \"Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation\".He has aimed to rally support for the taxes, offering $2,000 tariff rebate cheques to Americans - even as the US Supreme Court is currently weighing whether Trump had the legal authority to implement them.  But the latest exemptions signal a reversal by the Trump administration, as the White House seeks to lower prices by walking back levies on some food staples.Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said the decision will affect products that are not produced in the US, \"so there's no protection of our industries, or our food products\".He added that he doesn't think more policy rollbacks will be required in the future, saying \"I don't think it'll be necessary.\" \"We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods, like coffee as an example, where the prices of coffee were a little bit high. Now they'll be on the low side in a very short period of time,\" Trump said.Economists have warned that companies would pass the cost of tariffs onto their customers in the form of higher prices.While inflation remained milder than many analysts had expected in September, most items tracked in the Department of Labor inflation report showed price increases, with groceries up 2.7% from last year.The Trump administration's new tariff exemptions for food products take effect retroactively at midnight on Thursday 13 November, the White House said.In another move to address concerns among consumers about grocery prices, the Trump administration said import taxes on coffee and bananas will be lowered as part of trade deals with four Latin American countries.This week, Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both vowed to decrease coffee prices by 20% in the US this year.The White House released a list that includes more than 100 products no longer subject to the levies. Some of them include: CoffeeCocoaBlack teaGreen teaVanilla beansBeef products, including high-quality cuts, bone-in and boneless cuts, corned beef, some frozen items, as well as salted, brined, dried or smoked meatFruits, including acai, avocadoes, bananas, coconuts, guavas, limes, oranges, mangoes, plantains, pineapples, various peppers and tomatoesSpices, including allspice, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, curry, dill fennel seeds, ginger, mace, nutmeg, oregano, paprika, saffron and turmericNuts, grains, roots and seeds, such as barley, Brazil nuts, capers, cashews, chestnuts, macadamia nuts, miso, palm hearts, pine nuts, poppy seeds, tapioca, taro and water chestnuts",

    "body": "4 hours agoCherylann Mollan,BBC News and Gopal Kateshiya and Roxy Gagdekar Chhara,BBC GujaratiGetty ImagesPolice say that they uncovered a massive cybercrime racket Hacked CCTV videos from a maternity hospital in India have been sold on Telegram, police say, raising serious questions about privacy and security in a country where such cameras have become commonplace.Earlier this year, police in Gujarat state were alerted by the media to videos on YouTube - some showed pregnant women undergoing medical exams and receiving injections in their buttocks - in a maternity hospital in a city. The videos had a link directing viewers to Telegram channels to buy longer videos. The director of the hospital told the BBC that the cameras had been installed for the safety of doctors. The BBC is not naming the city or hospital to protect the identity of the women in the videos. None of them have filed a police complaint.Police say their investigation uncovered a massive cybercrime racket where sensitive footage from at least 50,000 CCTVs from across the country was stolen by hackers and sold on the internet.CCTVs have become ubiquitous in India, especially in urban areas. They are installed in malls, offices, hospitals, schools, private apartment complexes and even inside people's homes.Experts warn that while CCTV boosts security, poorly installed or managed systems can threaten privacy. In India, cameras are often handled by staff without cybersecurity training, and some domestically manufactured models are reportedly easily exploitable.In 2018, a tech worker in Bengaluru city said that his webcam was hacked, and that the hacker demanded payment in exchange for not sharing his private videos. In 2023, a YouTuber reportedly found out that his home CCTV had been hacked after private videos went viral.Last year, the federal government asked states to not procure CCTVs from suppliers with a history of security and data breaches and also introduced new rules to improve cyber security of CCTV cameras. But hacking incidents like these are still reported.Getty ImagesCCTV cameras are ubiquitous in IndiaIn Gujarat, police say they ended up discovering a \"network of individuals spread across the country\".\"[They] were hacking into the video surveillance systems - or CCTV systems - of hospitals, schools, colleges, corporate offices and even the bedrooms of private individuals in multiple states,\" Lavina Sinha, who heads the Ahmedabad cyber crime department investigating the case, told reporters.Hardik Makadiya, Gujarat's top cybercrime official, says videos were sold for 800–2,000 rupees  ($9-22; £7-17, with Telegram channels offering live CCTV feeds via subscription.Police have registered a case under various sections of the law, including violating a female patient's privacy, publishing obscene material, voyeurism and cyber terrorism - which is a non-bailable offence. They say that they reached out to Telegram and YouTube, and the videos have been taken down.Since February, police have arrested eight people in the case - four from Maharashtra and others from Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Delhi, and Uttarakhand. They remain in judicial custody as the case proceeds in court.CCTV: Why do so many Indians love surveillance?Yash Koshti, lawyer for three of the accused, denied the allegations, saying they were not hackers or cyber criminals and that someone else carried out the breach.Cybercrime investigator Ritesh Bhatia warns that weakly protected CCTV and home networks are easy targets and must be properly secured.\"Wireless CCTV systems help you access the footage remotely, like on your smartphone or laptop. But once a system is connected to the web, it's easy for hackers to decode its IP address and default password. And once they get into the system, they can see or record live footage, download it or even shut down the system,\" Mr Bhatia says.He says that one way to secure surveillance systems is to change IP addresses and the default password.Mr Bhatia advises using a robust password that mixes letters, numbers, and symbols and cannot be found in a dictionary, and recommends periodic audits by a cybersecurity professional.He adds that CCTV manufacturers also bear responsibility, and their packaging should clearly warn users to replace default passwords with strong ones - similar to cigarette packet health warnings.Getty ImagesA CCTV surveillance sign in Tamil Nadu; such signs are common across IndiaMr Makadiya told the BBC that many of the hacked CCTVs used default passwords - like Admin123 - or weak ones.\"The hackers used brute force (the use of certain programmes to generate thousands of letter-number password combinations) to break into these systems and access videos,\" he said.Audrey Dmello of Majlis, a legal centre for women's and children's rights, highlights the ubiquity of CCTVs in India, often installed without consent. She urges organisations, especially in sensitive spaces, to ensure their systems are properly secured.\"Organisations and institutions that set up surveillance systems, especially in sensitive spaces, must see to it that their systems are adequately secured. It's an absolute must,\" she says.The director of one of the affected hospitals told the BBC the CCTVs in exam and injection rooms were meant to protect doctors from false allegations. He added that the cameras have since been removed from sensitive areas.Police in Gujarat told the BBC that neither the hospital nor any patient had come forward to file a formal complaint. The complaint was finally lodged by a police officer.\"Female patients fear that their identity will be revealed. Therefore, they are not willing to lodge a complaint,\" said an officer.Ms Dmello says that the shame women face around such incidents only adds to its horrific nature.\"When there is a sexual angle involved, the victim is re-victimised because of the patriarchal nature of Indian society. If we want women to assert their rights and we want criminals to be brought to justice, we, as a society, should first stop shaming and blaming women for the crime,\" she says.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "Feud erupts between Trump and ally Marjorie Taylor Greene ahead of Epstein files voteDisagreements between Donald Trump and Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene have ballooned into a public feud, signalling a breakdown in relations between the US president and one of his fiercest defenders.On Friday, Trump called Greene \"wacky\" in social media posts and said she should be unseated in next year's elections. On Saturday, he called her a \"traitor\". Greene has in recent days questioned whether Trump was still putting \"America First\" and criticised his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.The feud comes as the House is set to consider whether to release the files to the public, with speaker Mike Johnson saying he would put the bill to a vote this coming week.Known as the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the aim of the bill is to make the justice department release all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials linked to Jeffrey Epstein.US outlet Politico reported a vote could come as soon as Tuesday. \"All I see \"Wacky\" Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!\" Trump posted on Friday night, claiming that she turned on him after he suggested that she shouldn't run for governor or senator in her home state of Georgia. \"She has told many people that she is upset that I don't return her phone calls anymore,\" Trump said, adding: \"I can't take a ranting Lunatic's call every day.\"He pledged to back any Republican opponent that takes her on in next year's midterm elections, when she is up for reelection, before intensifying his attacks in social media posts on Saturday from his home in Florida.\"Marjorie 'Traitor' Green [sic] is a disgrace to our GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY!\" he wrote.The comments follow days of criticism from Greene, who has said that Trump is not doing enough to bring down costs for voters. She also denounced his recent decisions in foreign conflicts and on tariff policies.But she has been most critical of his approach to handling the Epstein files. The turnaround is remarkable for a lawmaker who stood by Trump during multiple scandals, most notably the Capitol riot in 2021 when Trump supporters stormed the US legislature in an attempt to block Trump's election defeat. The US president also vigorously defended Greene when she was accused of promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories.Greene is one of only four House Republicans who joined Democrats in signing a discharge petition calling for the release of the Epstein files last week.On Friday, Greene posted on X that Trump was trying to stop other Republicans from voting in favour of the Epstein petition.\"He's coming after me hard to make an example to scare all the other Republicans before next weeks vote to release the Epstein files,\" she posted, adding: \"It's astonishing really how hard he's fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level.\"She returned to X on Saturday to say Trump had made her a target for threats \"fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world\".\"As a Republican, who overwhelmingly votes for President Trump's bills and agenda, his aggression against me... is completely shocking to everyone,\" she wrote.\"I don't worship or serve Donald Trump,\" she wrote in one post. \"I worship God, Jesus is my savior, and I serve my district GA14 and the American people.\"Former Republican pollster and strategist Robert Moran said it was clear the US president did not want the Epstein files to be released and \"is trying to pressure\" Greene. Mr Moran doubted the row would affect Trump's popularity as the electorate was so divided, but said it was inevitable the files would eventually come out. \"Many of his voters are sceptical of power and so they want power to be held to account, and they support the release of these files,\" he added.Trump has long faced criticism from both parties over his handling of the US Department of Justice files related to Epstein, the late financier and convicted paedophile. Trump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the US president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.",

    "body": "2 days agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent, RomeReutersPope Leo has held an audience with Hollywood stars, urging actors and directors including Cate Blanchett, Viggo Mortensen and Monica Bellucci to continue their work as \"pilgrims of the imagination\", helping to \"bring hope\".The celebrity meeting was a sprinkling of star dust for a still relatively new pope and a way for the Catholic Church to engage more with the world beyond.It was also a strong show of support from Leo XIV for the global film industry, as he spoke out against the \"troubling decline\" in cinema-going.Hailed by director Spike Lee as a \"great day\", the gathering was the first of its kind in the Vatican.Beneath the magnificent frescoes of the Clementine Hall, Pope Leo spoke in Italian to praise the power of cinema to entertain and to educate – and for its \"capacity to amaze\".But he urged filmmakers not to shy away from what he called \"the world's wounds\".\"Violence, poverty, exile, loneliness, addiction and forgotten wars are issues that need to be acknowledged and narrated,\" the Pope said. \"Good cinema does not exploit pain; it recognizes and explores it. This is what all the great directors have done.\"Six months since a conclave of cardinals elected the first North American to the Papacy, some Catholics feel that Leo has been slow to stamp his own mark on the role.His predecessor, Francis, was a charismatic Argentinian known for his off-the-cuff comments and dramatic gestures. Leo's style is far quieter, so this star-studded engagement is a new look.Watch: Among the stars to meet the Pope was Spike Lee who had a unique gift for Leo XIV.It's not clear how the cast list was drawn up, although none of the directors in the hall – who came from all over the world – made it onto the Pope's own top film list.This week, the Vatican revealed that his favourite four watches of all time included the 1960s nun-themed classic The Sound of Music, It's a Wonderful Life and Italian Roberto Benigni's multi award-winning Life is Beautiful.Among those who did join today's A-list audience were Mortensen, Chris Pine and filmmaker Gus Van Sant – of Milk and Good Will Hunting fame. The large Italian contingent included Gianni Amelio and Cinema Paradiso creator, Giuseppe Tornatore.At a time of immense pressure on film, not long after a major Hollywood strike and with funding strains here in Italy, the Pope spoke in defence of the industry.He was applauded loudly when he talked of the \"quiet dedication\" of all those behind the scenes with vital roles.ReutersThe audience for the international filmmakers was held beneath the magnificent frescoes of the Clementine Hall He also warned against the closure of cinemas which he characterised as the \"beating heart of communities\".\"More than a few people are saying that the art of cinema and the cinematic experience are in danger. I urge institutions not to give up, but to cooperate in affirming the social and cultural value of this activity,\" the Pope said.After a fifteen-minute speech and a blessing he then received each audience member in turn, led by Blanchett.\"He really urged us to go back into our day jobs and inspire people,\" the Australian-born star told reporters.One of many who came bearing gifts, the actress – who works with the UN refugee agency, UNHCR – placed a woven bracelet in the Pope's hand. \"It was a bracelet I wear in solidarity with people who are displaced,\" she explained later.Lee handed the Chicago-born Pope a New York Knicks shirt printed with the number 14 and the words Pope Leo.",

    "body": "The US will help South Korea build nuclear 'attack' submarines - here's what that means15 hours agoJake Kwon,Seoul and Gavin Butler,SingaporeGetty ImagesA file photo of the USS Kentucky nuclear submarine during a visit to South KoreaSouth Korea's government has announced that it has finalised an agreement to build nuclear-powered submarines in partnership with the United States.The US has approved the \"attack submarines\" and agreed to cooperate in sourcing fuel, according to a fact sheet released by the White House on Thursday.The agreement marks a significant step in South Korea's relations with the US and comes amid a period of growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula: with the nuclear-armed North Korea, and an expansionist China to the west.Here's what you need to know about the agreement. What's in the agreement? The agreement between the US and South Korea comes as leaders from both countries reached a broad trade deal earlier last month that would see reciprocal tariffs cut to 15% from 25%. US President Donald Trump had slapped a tariff rate on Seoul of 25% earlier this year - which his counterpart Lee Jae Myung managed to negotiate down to 15%, after Seoul said it would invest $350bn (£265bn) in the US, including $200bn in cash investment and $150bn in shipbuilding.In a White House readout released on Thursday, the US said it had \"given approval for the Republic of Korea to build nuclear-powered attack submarines... [and would] work closely to advance requirements for this project, including avenues to source fuel\".In an earlier post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump had said the vessels would be constructed at a shipyard in Philadelphia run by South Korean conglomerate Hanwha.Only six countries currently possess nuclear-powered strategic submarines: the US, China, Russia, the UK, France and India.South Korea already possesses about 20 submarines, but they are all diesel propelled and therefore need to surface far more frequently. Nuclear submarines are also able to operate further and faster.\"I have given them approval to build a nuclear-powered submarine, rather than the old-fashioned, and far less nimble, diesel-powered submarines that they have now,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.South Korea is a powerhouse when it comes to civilian nuclear energy. It had a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s but gave it up following US pressure. And so its ability to enrich or reprocess uranium is limited by the US as it is entirely dependent on imports. Why does South Korea want nuclear submarines? The latest vessel programme is aimed at countering North Korea, which recently revealed that it was pursuing its own nuclear submarine programme.President Lee had told Trump at the APEC summit last month that South Korea needed them for that express purpose.In a TV interview last week, Ahn Gyu-back, South Korea's Minister of Defence, said that nuclear submarines would be a \"proud achievement\" for South Korea, and a major leap in strengthening the country's defence against the North.The stealth of nuclear submarines would keep North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"awake at night\", he added. Getty ImagesUS President Donald Trump met his Korean counterpart in South Korea last monthDoes North Korea have nuclear submarines?North Korea has also been pursuing a nuclear submarine programme – possibly with Russia's help, according to South Korean officials.In March 2025, North Korea unveiled pictures of what it claimed was a nuclear-powered submarine that was under construction, showing Kim visiting the shipyard. Pyongyang is expected to have the submarines within the next few years.North Korea is also estimated to have an arsenal of approximately 50 nuclear weapons, as part of its broader nuclear weapons programme.Jo Bee-yun, a research fellow at the Sejong Institute, suggested that Seoul's acquisition of nuclear submarines will help it stay apace in East Asia's escalating arms race.\"North Korea's nuclear weapon is an established fact,\" she told the BBC. \"[South Korea acquiring] nuclear submarines is only a step in the larger trend of rising tension.\"Will this inflame tensions on the Korean Peninsula?It is unclear how much the nuclear-propelled submarines will contribute to South Korea's defence capabilities – and though they are very expensive, they don't quite change the balance of power on the Korean Peninsula, according to some experts.Yang Uk, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, told the BBC that the nuclear subs' primary purpose is to assure South Korean voters that their government is responding to North Korea's nuclear threat.\"South Korea cannot develop its own nuclear weapons to counter North Korea's,\" Dr Yang said. \"What's something that they can do? Fielding nuclear submarines.\"Dr Yang believes North Korea might revel in the change, however, because it reinforces their justification to hold on to nuclear weapons – meaning it will become more difficult to demand that Pyongyang give up its nuclear arsenal.Jo nonetheless emphasised the strategic advantage that South Korea stands to gain from the new submarine deal, describing it as a \"major change\" which \"means South Korea is now a regional player\". \"The best feature of a nuclear submarine is its speed,\" she said. \"It can now go fast and far and South Korea can operate together with more countries.\"What's in it for the United States?For Washington, support for South Korea's nuclear-powered submarine programme likely aims to put pressure on both North Korea and China.\"Trump has put the burden of defence spending on the back of South Korea,\" Dr Yang explained. \"South Korea will greatly expand its defence budget. They will act as America's proxy in putting pressure on China and North Korea.\"Getty ImagesDonald Trump is attempting to counter the influence of other nations in South Korea, according to expertsUS and China have long competed for strategic influence in South Korea, leaving Seoul to walk a geopolitical tightrope. More recently, China has been increasing its naval activity near South Korea's maritime border – a move akin to those seen in the South China Sea.Beijing must be \"furious\" about South Korea's nuclear submarine agreement with the US, Dr Yang said.Following the deal's announcement, the Chinese Ambassador to South Korea, Dai Bing, said he hoped South Korea would \"deal with this issue prudently, taking into consideration the concerns of all sides\".Dai also added that Beijing was engaging with Seoul on the matter through diplomatic channels, and emphasised that \"the (security) situation on the Korean Peninsula and in the region is still complex and sensitive\".What next?Although President Trump said the submarines would be built in Philadelphia and bring jobs to the US, South Korean officials have maintained they must be built locally, where existing facilities can deliver them in a much shorter timeline.South Korea's Prime Minister Kim Min-seok had himself said during a parliamentary hearing that the South Korean owned shipyard in Philadelphia did \"not have the capability\" to build such vessels, according to reports. Hanwha, who owns the shipyard, has yet to comment on the matter. But now that an agreement has been reached, the next step is to adjust the nuclear agreement between the two countries, allowing for the US to provide nuclear fuel and to set the fence for its military use.",

    "body": "2 days agoIone WellsSouth America CorrespondentAFP via Getty ImagesTens of millions of cubic metres of toxic waste and mud were unleashed through communities surrounding the damMining company BHP has been found liable for a 2015 dam collapse in Brazil, known as the country's worst-ever environmental disaster, by London's High Court.The dam collapse killed 19 people, polluted the river and destroyed hundreds of homes.The civil lawsuit, representing more than 600,000 people including civilians, local governments and businesses, had been valued at up to £36bn ($48bn).BHP said it would appeal against the ruling and continue to fight the lawsuit and has said many claimants in the London lawsuit had already been paid compensation in Brazil.The dam in Mariana, southeastern Brazil, was owned by Samarco, a joint venture between the mining giants Vale and BHP.The claimants' lawyers argued successfully that the trial should be held in London because BHP headquarters \"were in the UK at the time of the dam collapse\".A separate claim against Samarco's second parent company, Brazilian mining company Vale, was filed in the Netherlands, with more than 70,000 plaintiffs.The dam was used to store waste from iron ore mining. When it burst, it unleashed tens of millions of cubic metres of toxic waste and mud. The sludge swept through communities, destroying hundreds of people's homes and poisoning the river.Judge Finola O'Farrell said in her High Court ruling that continuing to raise the height of the dam when it was not safe to do so was the \"direct and immediate cause\" of the dam's collapse, meaning BHP was liable under Brazilian law.BHP is expected to appeal the ruling. President of BHP's Minerals Americas, Brandon Craig, said in a statement that 240,000 claimants in the London lawsuit \"have already been paid compensation in Brazil\".\"We believe this will significantly reduce the size and value of claims in the UK group action,\" he added.The lawsuit has been littered with different clashes between the UK firm representing the claimants, Pogust Goodhead, and BHP. BHP always denied liability and said the London lawsuit duplicated legal proceedings and reparation and repair programmes in Brazil.BHP and Vale have set up an organisation called the Renova Foundation tasked with compensating victims. It has offered them either cash compensation, or a house in a new city that the foundation has built to replace the town of Novo Bento and has disbursed billions of dollars in repair and compensation actions to hundreds of thousands of people.In June, a presentation by BHP and Vale's Samarco venture said around 130,000 people in Brazil had reached settlements with them. In response, Pogust Goodhead alleged the companies had pressured claimants to \"settle their claims at far below their true value\" and that it would seek £1.3bn in unpaid fees lost as a result.It alleged that a $30.3bn compensation agreement which Brazil signed with BHP, Vale and Samarco in October 2024 prevented claimants from discussing the deal with the firm or paying its legal fees.The firm said it had incurred $1bn in borrowing costs to finance the English case.BHP said it rejected Pogust Goodhead's allegations in their entirety and dispute \"their factual and legal basis.\"It said the claims were \"without merit\" and BHP would \"vigorously contest them.\" A spokesperson also said that the firm continued to believe Brazil was the most appropriate, effective, and efficient place for compensation for the dam collapse.AFP via Getty ImagesSome of those affected by the disaster travelled to the High Court last yearBut there were also parallel claims that Pogust Goodhead – which promotes itself as a firm representing human rights and environmental law – had tried to profit off \"vulnerable\" Brazilians.During proceedings the firm was accused of \"misleading\" vulnerable Brazilians for its own gain by a Brazilian judge in the state of Minas Gerais.Pogust Goodhead rejected the accusation at the time as \"without merit\". In a claim brought by the Public Prosecutors and Public Defenders in Brazil against Pogust Goodhead, the judge criticised several \"allegedly abusive clauses\" in Pogust Goodhead's contracts with Brazilians who suffered damage.Among these, it alleges the law firm engaged in \"misleading advertising\" considering the \"hypervulnerability of those affected\".It also alleges \"undue charging of fees on compensation amounts obtained extrajudicially in Brazil\" which it said represents \"illicit enrichment that diverts essential resources from those affected\" and \"excessive\" penalties for claimants who terminated their contracts which it said \"discouraged\" them from joining national compensation programmes.The former Brazilian ambassador in London and Washington, Rubens Barbosa, told the BBC earlier this year that he believed this amounted to spreading misleading information in Brazil.Mr Barbosa said bringing the case to London \"hinders efforts to resolve the matter locally\" and the \"extremely vulnerable Brazilians were misled\" by contracts.",

Police said there was no reason to think the incident was intentional. Officials are still trying to establish the identities of the victims. The bus was not in service at the time and no passengers were on board, local media report. The crash happened near the Royal Institute of Technology university at about 15:23 (14:23 GMT).Images from the scene show rescue crews appearing to help people trapped underneath the double-decker bus.A witness who owns a shop on the street told SVT the bus hit a pole in front of the bus shelter. They said several people ran into the shop crying.A woman told the local Expressen newspaper that the bus \"mowed down an entire bus stop queue\". She said people were screaming and trying to help the injured, while dead people lay on the ground.\"There must have been more people under the bus,\" she said.Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said his thoughts were with the victims and their families.\"People who might have been on their way home to family, friends, or a quiet evening at home.

    "body": "'We're just going to go through this again': Americans fear second government shutdownBeth Johnson is accustomed to the uncertainty that comes with being a military wife - picking up and moving her family every three years. The crippling anxiety that comes with a US government shutdown, however, is not something she is used to.She is one of the millions of Americans who sighed a deep breath of relief when politicians in Washington agreed to reopen the government earlier this week.At 43 days, it was the longest shutdown in US history. But that relief could be short-lived, as the funding agreement expires at the end of January, when Congress will face the same spending challenge once again. \"It really affects every part of your life when your family’s sole source of income comes from the federal government,” Ms Johnson said. \"The uncertainty is crippling.\" \"Government, just do your job\" - Frustration at airports as shutdown delays continueThe Tennessee mother of two has lived in seven states since her husband joined the military nearly 20 years ago. Picking up and moving her family every three years means it is tough for her - and other service members' spouses - to get work, so the Johnson family lives on one paycheque. Not knowing whether or not military service members would receive their paycheques from the shuttered government left her family with difficult decisions. Some 1.3 million active-duty personnel are required to serve during government shutdowns potentially without pay, but the Trump administration stepped in twice during the autumn shutdown to reallocate funds for those servicemembers.But without certainty, many families had to tighten their belts. One of Ms Johnson’s sons even offered to get fewer Christmas Gifts - “it’s ok we don’t need them,” he said to his mother. Ms Johnson is frustrated by what she described as unnecessary sacrifice from millions of Americans.“What was it all for? Why were we suffering for over 40 days in uncertainty, not knowing what was going to happen,\" she questioned. \"What was the point? We’re just going to go through this again probably in January.”The agreement Congress made this week funds the government for the next two months, guarantees that all federal workers will be paid for time during the shutdown, and funds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) - which provides food aid to one in eight Americans - until next September.Sierra Bird is one of the more than 42 million Americans who depend on funds from Snap to feed her family.The Florida mother of four gets about $900 a month, but those funds were delayed because they were caught up in the spending bill.Ms Bird said she \"survived\" the shutdown and her Snap card will be reloaded over the weekend. She'll return to some sense of normal, but she's also weary another shutdown could be on the horizon and she said she would start stockpiling food, just in case.\"People are going to take what they need if they don't have what they need,\" Ms Bird said. \"Don't mess with people's food.\"While Snap benefits have resumed, one thing that hasn't come back is health-insurance subsidies. It was those subsidies that Democrats had said they were willing to fight for, which helped fuel the shutdown in the first place. Democrats had said they would not approve the budget unless the subsidies continued. But on Tuesday, eight Democrats sided with Republicans to approve a spending plan without them.\"I swapped one stress for another,\" Ms Bird said. \"I would rather have the affordable healthcare than Snap, because I can feed them rice and beans and survive, but I need my medications.\"In addition to those struggling to put food on the table during the shutdown, more than 1.4 million federal employees went without pay for 43 days.Sarah, a Utah Interior Department employee who asked her last name not be used, was among them. She was furloughed from the start of the shutdown on 1 October and as the days and weeks went by she worried she would have to find another way to make money.\"I was trying to decide if I wanted to give up the federal sector altogether to find another career,\" Sarah said. As an archaeologist, she works in a unique, specialised role, making it hard to transfer her expertise to another job or industry.Her worries were quelled on Thursday when she returned to work for the first time in weeks, following the government's reopening, but she is already preparing for the prospect of another one come January. \"With the holidays coming up, I'm not going to spending a whole lot of money,\" she said, noting she is putting off certain remodelling projects too. \"I would not be the least bit surprised if another shutdown happened.\"In the less than 80 days until the next potential government shutdown, Ms Johnson, the military wife, said she would be preparing, just in case. \"We're making a huge effort to watch unnecessary spending and save money where we can so we have a bigger nest egg built up because if the government shuts down again in January there's no guarantee that active duty military is going to get paid.\"",

    "body": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has vowed to \"overhaul\" state-owned energy companies, after a major corruption scandal engulfed the country's energy sector.Around $100 million (£76m) has been embezzled, anti-graft investigators said, causing outrage in a country where Russian attacks have resulted in crippling power outages.\"Alongside a full audit of their financial activities, the management of these companies is to be renewed,\" Zelensky wrote in a post on X on Saturday. Energoatom, the state nuclear company at the heart of the scandal, will have a new supervisory board \"within a week,\" he added. Several of those implicated in the scandal have close links to the Ukrainian president.The scandal is unfolding against the backdrop of escalating Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities, including substations that supply electricity to nuclear power plants.\"I have also instructed government officials to maintain constant and meaningful communication with law enforcement and anti-corruption bodies,\" Zelensky wrote. He also called for the quick appointment of a new head of Ukrhydroenergo, a hydropower generating company, and reforms for oil and gas giant Naftogaz and the nation's Gas Transmission System Operator. Two ministers were forced to resign over the corruption scheme and a former business partner of Zelensky was sanctioned earlier this week when the scandal broke.On Monday, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (Nabu) and Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap) said the 15 month-long investigation had revealed several members of the Ukrainian government were involved.Some of those implicated in the scandal are or have been, close associates of Zelensky's. Among those alleged to be involved are Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko, former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov and Timur Mindich - a businessman and a co-owner of Zelensky's former TV studio Kvartal95.Zelensky has previously said he is committed to cooperate fully with the anti-corruption investigation.\"I have also instructed government officials to maintain constant and meaningful communication with law enforcement and anti-corruption bodies,\" he said on Saturday.\"The full transparency and integrity in the energy sector remain an absolute priority.\"But the scandal has brought Zelensky's commitment to fighting corruption under scrutiny once again. In July, he faced backlash after he signed a law limiting the independence of Nabu and Sap. The outrage was only quelled by Zelensky's decision to reinstate their freedom, but the debacle prompted criticism from European allies including France and Germany, while ambassadors from the G7 group of nations expressed the desire to discuss the issue with the Ukrainian leadership.",

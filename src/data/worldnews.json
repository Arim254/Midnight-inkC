    "body": "15 hours agoDearbail JordanDeadly fire at Turkey ski resort hotelThe owner of a Turkish hotel and 10 others have been sentenced to life in prison following the deadliest fire in the country's history.The blaze at the Grand Kartal Hotel in Bolu broke out during school holidays in January, killed 78 people including 34 children.Owner Halit Ergül, his wife and two daughters were handed the maximum penalty after being found guilty of severe negligence, along with Bolu's deputy mayor and the local fire chief.In total, there were 32 people facing charges over the fire which tore through the building in the early hours of the morning, resulting in some residents jumping from the 12-storey building to escape the flames. What lead to the hotel fire disaster?Dozens killed as fire engulfs Turkish ski hotelIn addition, 137 people were injured in the blaze at the northern mountain resort of Kartalkaya. Hilmi Altin, who lost his wife and nine-year-old daughter, told AFP news agency: \"I go to the cemetery each day. No psychologist can ease such a pain.\"An inquiry found that some safety equipment had not worked at the time of the fire, which started in the hotel's restaurant. Also, some of the building's gas equipment did not meet safety standards.Ergul denied responsibility. He said the hotel had regular inspections and blamed the gas supplier. He also said the tourism ministry was responsible for oversight.\"If I had foreseen the risk, I would have closed the hotel myself,\" he told the hearing which took place inside a specially constructed court room at a local school. A further 18 defendants received sentences ranging from 12 to 22 years. Most were hotel employees. Others were acquitted, including two cooks.The Bolu mountains are popular with skiers from Istanbul and Turkey's capital Ankara, which is about 170km (105 miles) away. At the time of the disaster, the hotel was operating at high occupancy as it was the start of school holidays.",

    "body": "16 hours agoJessica MurphyUniversal Images Group via Getty ImagesThe Trump administration cannot suspend food aid used by more than 40 million low-income Americans amid the ongoing US government shutdown, two federal judges have ruled. The decisions, issued within moments of each other on Friday by judges in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, said the government must pay for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or Snap, benefits using emergency funds.The Snap programme works by giving people reloadable debit cards that they can use to buy essential grocery items.The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced this week it would not distribute food assistance funds in November due to the shutdown, saying \"the well has run dry\". A family of four on average receives $715 (£540) per month, which breaks down to a little less than $6 (£4.50) per day, per person.The states administer the benefits, using money from the federal government, which has been unfunded and shut down since 1 October. Several states have pledged to use their own funds to cover any shortfall, however the federal government has warned that they will not be reimbursed.Half of US states had sued the Trump administration over its plans to halt funding, hoping to force it to use a roughly $6bn (£4.5bn) emergency contingency fund for  Snap, also known as food stamps.The Massachusetts judge said the administration must access the contingency funding to pay the benefits and had until Monday to report back to the court on whether they will authorise at least partial benefits for November.Massachusetts US District Judge Indira Talwani wrote in her decision that the  states who sued are likely to win in court on their claim that \"Congress intended the funding of SNAP benefits, at a reduced rate if necessary, when appropriated funds prove insufficient\".Judge Talwani also wrote that the Trump administration \"erred in concluding\" that the USDA is blocked by law from tapping the emergency reserves in the contingency fund when there is a lapse in federal funding.The USDA had said those reserves were insufficient to pay full benefits, which cost $8.5bn to $9bn each month. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins had said she would only use the fund for an emergency such as a natural disaster.Even if the government turns to the contingency fund, it would only be able to cover about 60% of beneficiaries in a single month, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a think-tank focused on policies that help low-income families.Judge Talwani has asked the administration to report on Monday whether it will use the fund to pay reduced benefits or if it will pay full benefits for the month by moving money from other programmes, similar to the administration transferring military research funds earlier this month to pay members of the armed forces.Separately in Rhode Island, a lawsuit was brought by a number of US cities and NGOs who sued over what they called the \"unlawful suspension\" of the programme.\"There is no doubt and it is beyond argument that irreparable harm will begin to occur if it hasn't already occurred in the terror it has caused some people about the availability of funding for food, for their family,\" US  District Judge John  McConnell said.The White House and the USDA did not comment on the decisions. The BBC has also contacted the Office of Management and Budget for comment.At a news conference before the rulings were issued, Rollins said \"we're looking at all the options\" when asked whether the administration would comply if courts required it to release funds. On Friday, the group behind the lawsuit filed in Rhode Island said in a statement that the ruling \"is a lifeline for millions of families, seniors, and veterans who depend on SNAP to put food on the table\".\"It reaffirms a fundamental principle: no administration can use hunger as a political weapon.\"Republicans and Democrats have traded blame for the federal shutdown, which will soon enter its second month, and there has not been any meaningful progress toward a deal.",

    "body": "20 hours agoDanielle KayeBusiness reporterSubscribers to YouTube TV have lost access to ESPN, ABC and other Disney channels, as the two companies struggle to negotiate a licensing deal.Disney said the online pay-TV platform, which is owned by the tech giant Google and available only in the US, had refused to pay fair rates for the content, which also include National Geographic and the Disney channel. In its own statement, YouTube TV said that Disney's proposed terms \"disadvantage our members while benefiting Disney's own live TV products\".After tense negotiations, the channels vanished from YouTube TV just before midnight on Thursday - the deadline to reach a new deal. The blackout affects roughly 10 million subscribers.If Disney channels remain suspended for an \"extend period of time\", YouTube TV said it would offer subscribers a $20 credit.YouTube and Disney-owned Hulu are among the biggest online TV platforms in the US.Their stand-off follows similarly contentious talks this year between YouTube and other media companies, which had also threatened to limit the shows available to YouTube TV subscribers. Google struck a deal at the last minute with Comcast-owned NBCUniversal earlier this month to keep shows like \"Sunday Night Football\" on YouTube TV. It has also reached agreements with Paramount and Fox in recent months.In separate statements, both Google and Disney said they were working toward a resolution to restore Disney content to YouTube TV.Still, the companies remain divided on fees.\"With a $3 trillion market cap, Google is using its market dominance to eliminate competition and undercut the industry-standard terms we've successfully negotiated with every other distributor,\" a Disney spokesperson said in a statement.But YouTube said in a statement that Disney was proposing \"costly economic terms\" that would lead to higher prices for YouTube TV customers and limit their options for content, benefiting Disney's own live TV offerings like Hulu+ Live TV.",

    "body": "Shares worth €1.3bn (£1.1bn; $1.5bn) have been seized from the company that controls the manufacturer of Campari over alleged tax evasion, Italian police have said.Officials ordered the confiscation of the Campari Group shares from Luxembourg-based Lagfin as part of a year-long investigation into how it absorbed its Italian arm.It is accused of failing to pay a similar figure to that of the shares seized in taxes during that merger. The company said it had always acted according to tax laws.Campari - which also produces alcohol brands including Aperol, Grand Marnier and Courvoisier - said neither it nor its subsidiaries were involved in the case. However, chair Luca Garavoglia is among those under investigation, local media reports.Lagfin - which owns more than 50% of Campari shares and has 80% of voting rights - told the BBC in a statement that it had \"always acted in the most scrupulous respect of any applicable laws and regulations, including any Italian tax laws\".Prosecutors in Milan launched a probe into the company last year. Financial police said on Friday that they allegedly found €5.3bn of undeclared capital gains between 2018 and 2020 on which it had not paid a so-called \"exit tax\", levied on firms that transfer their headquarters abroad.It is also accused of transferring its Italian assets into foreign ownership solely for tax purposes, according to Italian financial newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore.Mr Garavoglia, the billionaire who inherited ownership of Campari from his late mother, is implicated alongside Giovanni Berto, the head of Campari's Italian branch, local media reports.Lagfin said it will \"defend itself vigorously\" in the matter, which it characterised as a \"tax dispute\".The company stressed that Campari had never been involved \"in any manner whatsoever\" in the matter, adding that, as it held 80% of Campari's voting rights, the seizure was \"absolutely unable to affect the position of Lagfin as controlling shareholder of Campari\".One of the largest global producers of spirits, Campari is valued at around €7bn on the Milan Stock Exchange.The company has its roots in 1860, when Gaspare Campari's homemade bitter liqueur became a popular tipple among patrons of his Milan bar. It became so successful that, in 1904, his family began manufacturing it commercially, and from the 1990s onwards the firm began acquiring other alcohol brands.",

    "body": "Six suspects have been arrested near the French city of Lyon in connection with the country's latest brazen heist.Thieves used explosives to break into a precious metals refinery on Thursday before making off with the loot, which was mostly gold and worth €12m (£10.5m, $13.8m).Following a chase, police caught the suspects and recovered the haul, officials said. The heist came after five more people were arrested over a theft at the Louvre Museum in Paris earlier this month.In the Lyon incident, footage posted on social media by people living near the facility showed two men near a white van. One could be seen placing a ladder over the company's fence before scaling it.Another video showed a robber carrying a weapon and opening the rear door of the van, while another loaded briefcases into the vehicle.An unnamed neighbour told AFP news agency she heard a big explosion. \"It was really impressive,\" she said.Five employees of the firm Pourquery Laboratories suffered minor injuries in the explosion, officials told AFP.A woman was among those detained after the chase. Assault rifles and explosives were also seized, police said. Meanwhile, the latest arrests over the Louvre heist in Paris bring the number of those detained to seven.On 19 October, four suspects used a mechanical lift to gain access to the museum's Gallery of Apollo in broad daylight. They cracked open display cases housing crown jewels with a disc cutter and made off with items worth €88m (£76m; $102m).Police say those arrested include three of the thieves. Officers are still hunting the fourth.",

    "body": "Beijing has said it will loosen a chip export ban it imposed after Dutch authorities took over Nexperia - a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands.In September, the Netherlands used a Cold War-era law to take over the company and prevent the chips from becoming unavailable in an emergency, citing \"serious governance shortcomings\".China said in response that it would not re-export completed Nexperia chips to Europe, raising concern among carmakers. One association had described the move as \"alarming\". Around 70% of chips made in the Netherlands are sent to China to be completed and re-exported to other countries. China said in a statement on Saturday that it would \"comprehensively consider the actual situation of enterprises and grant exemptions to exports that meet the criteria\". However, it has not specified what that could entail. It also went on to criticise the Hague for what it called \"improper interference in the internal affairs of enterprises\" and blamed it for \"the current disruption of global production and supply chains\".The Dutch-controlled firm told customers it would stop sending chips back to China to be processed, according to a letter this week seen by the Reuters news agency.Last month, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) had warned Nexperia chip supplies would only last a few weeks unless the Chinese ban was lifted.\"Without these chips, European automotive suppliers cannot build the parts and components needed to supply vehicle manufacturers and this therefore threatens production stoppages,\" the group said.The latest plans by Beijing to relax its export controls have emerged after US President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping met in South Korea earlier this week.Trump later said the leaders discussed chips, while Beijing's post-meeting readout did not explicitly mention any area of trade.The White House is expected to release a fact sheet later on Saturday detailing its new trade agreement with China. Reuters reports that it will also announce the resumption of Nexperia exports.In December 2024, the US government placed Chinese chip manufacturer Wingtech on its so-called \"entity list\", identifying the company as a national security concern.In the UK, Nexperia was forced to sell its silicon chip plant in Newport after MPs and ministers expressed national security concerns. It currently owns a UK facility in Stockport.",

    "body": "French actor Tchéky Karyo, who had a starring role in the film Nikita and the TV series The Missing, has died aged 72.Karyo, who was born in Turkey but grew up in Paris, died of a cancer on Friday, AFP news agency reported. Known largely for supporting roles, Karyo acted in films for nearly four decades, finding a second career in TV series in his final years.Karyo's wife, actress Valérie Keruzoré, and their children announced his death in a statement to the news agency. Karyo first made his mark in crime thriller La Balance (1982) and he played the handler Bob in Luc Besson's assassin film Nikita (1990).BBC audiences might best remember him for his role in The Missing (2014).The first eight-part series, about the search for a missing boy in France, starred Karyo as French detective Julien Baptiste. James Nesbitt and Frances O'Connor played the boy's parents.The second eight-part series, about a missing girl in Germany, was brodcast in 2016. Karyo returned as Baptiste, with David Morrissey and Keeley Hawes as the girl's parents.Both series received positive reviews, with critics praising the cast, especially Karyo's performance. In February 2019, a spin-off series titled Baptiste was broadcast on BBC One. Lindsay Salt, Director of BBC Drama, said: \"We are so sad to learn of the passing of Tchéky Karyo. He was a truly brilliant and much loved actor and he will be fondly remembered by BBC viewers for his roles in The Missing, Baptiste and most recently Boat Story. Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones at this time.\"Karyo was born on 4 October 1953 in Istanbul, the son of a Turkish lorry driver of Spanish-Jewish origin and a Greek mother, Le Monde newspaper writes.After several years as a theatrical actor, he saw his role in La Balance earn him a nomination for the César Award for Best Male Revelation.With his strong jaw and penetrating stare, he went on to star in dozens of films of all kinds. Other French films included Besson's Joan of Arc (1993) and the anti-war epic A Very Long Engagement (2004). He was also cast in Ridley Scott's 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992) and in the James Bond film GoldenEye (1995).One of his starring roles was as the medieval prophet Nostradamus in the 1994 film of the same name, while his tiniest role was undoubtedly in Amélie (2001) where he only appeared as a face on an ID photograph in an album.",

    "body": "1 day agoCherylann MollanBBC News, MumbaiIndia and the US have signed a framework agreement to expand defence cooperation over the next 10-years. The pact was announced after a meeting between US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh in Kuala Lumpur. The agreement will enhance \"coordination, information sharing and tech cooperation\" and advance \"regional stability and deterrence\", Hegseth said on X. It comes as the two countries are trying to close a trade deal and tide over tense ties after US President Donald Trump slapped 50% tariffs on India, including a 25% penalty for buying Russian oil and arms. The agreement is expected to provide policy direction to the entire spectrum of the India-US defence relationship. \"It is a signal of our growing strategic convergence and will herald a new decade of partnership. Defence will remain as a major pillar of our bilateral relations. Our partnership is critical for ensuring a free, open and rules-based Indo-Pacific region,\" Singh said, in a post on X. According to Pramit Pal Chaudhuri of the Eurasia Group think tank, the agreement was supposed to have been concluded in July-August this year, but India's irritation at Trump's statements about his role in ending the conflict with Pakistan led to it getting delayed. The pact is the latest in a series of agreements between the two countries that have made it \"easier for the two militaries to achieve interoperability, India to access technology and the two defence sectors to work together\", Mr Chaudhuri said. \"This provides for further potential in all three areas,\" he added. India and the US have been steadily ramping up their defence ties recently. Defence was a major talking point between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump on the former's visit to the US in February this year, withTrump saying the US would increase military equipment sales to India by many billions of dollars,  ultimately paving the way to providing Delhi with F-35 stealth warplanes.But since then, Delhi's dependence on discounted Russian oil as well as its long-standing defence relationship with Moscow have been a major point of irritation for the Trump administration. While Russia continues to be a major supplier of arms to India, its share of Indian defence imports has been steadily falling as Delhi seeks to diversify its portfolio and boost domestic capacity.In recent months India has hinted that it would be open to increasing energy and defence purchases from the US. The two countries are locked in high-stakes trade talks, aimed at reaching a long-awaited deal by November. With inputs from Soutik Biswas, India correspondent with the BBC.",

    "body": "19 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporterCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney accepted an invitation to visit China extended by President Xi Jinping, signalling a \"turning point\" in the countries' relationship.The invite came after the two leaders met for 40 minutes on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit on Friday. It was the first meeting between a Canadian prime minister and the Chinese president since 2017. The countries have had a strained relationship since a diplomatic row in 2018 and been locked in a trade dispute since 2024.But as trade tensions between Canada and the US continue to rise, Carney has said the country will turn to strengthening its ties with other major economies.He has signalled his desire to double Canada's non-US exports in the next decade, in response to President Donald Trump placing punishing tariffs on Canadian goods and some of its critical sectors. That includes closer trade ties with \"the economic giants of Asia\", Carney said last week. Speaking briefly to reporters after his meeting with Xi on Friday, Carney said he believed Canada and China had hit a \"turning point\" in relations that will yield positive developments for the Canadian economy. \"Distance is not the way to solve problems, not the way to serve our people,\" the prime minister said.In his own remarks, Xi said \"China is willing to work with Canada to push China-Canada relations back onto a healthy, stable, and sustainable correct track\" that benefited both countries. The two leaders directed officials \"to move quickly to resolve outstanding trade issues and irritants\", according to a readout released by Carney's office after the meeting. A trade dispute has been escalating since Canada placed a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) in October 2024, mirroring similar action by the US. Later that same month, Canada placed a 25% tariff on Chinese steel and aluminium. China retaliated in March by imposing tariffs on several Canadian agricultural products, including a 76% levy on canola seed imports and a 100% levy on canola oil, meal and peas.These measures have hurt farmers in the western part of the Canada, as China is by far the largest importer of the country's canola seeds. Some western provincial premiers, including Wab Kinew of Manitoba and Scott Moe of Saskatchewan, have since called on the federal government to drop tariffs on Chinese EVs. Kinew said earlier this month that Canada has now found itself in a \"two-front trade war\" with its two largest trading partners - the US and China.Separately, the US has imposed a 35% tariff on all Canadian goods not covered by an existing free trade agreement, as well as a 50% levy on steel and aluminium and a 25% levy on automobiles. Ontario premier demands apology from US ambassador over tariff 'tirade'What tariffs has Trump announced and why?Last week, US-Canada relations hit a new low after Trump suspended all trade talks over an anti-tariff advertisement run by Ontario Premier Doug Ford that featured an address on free trade by former US President Ronald Reagan. On Friday, Trump said the two countries will not restart trade talks. Trump has also threatened to raise tariffs on Canada another 10%, though it is unclear if and when that would come into effect. Prior to the tariffs, Canada-China relations were already reeling from a diplomatic row that resulted in Beijing detaining two Canadian citizens, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovring. The two were accused by China of espionage and were taken into custody in 2018. Their arrest came days after Canada detained Meng Wanzhou, a Chinese technology executive and chief financial officer of Huawei, at the request of the US. All three were subsequently released in 2021 after the US Department of Justice dropped an extradition request for Ms Wanzhou on charges of fraud.China was also one of the countries called out for possibly meddling in Canada's 2019 and 2021 elections, prompting a Canadian public inquiry into foreign interference. That inquiry concluded that attempts by foreign states to meddle in recent elections were \"troubling\" but had \"minimal impact\".China has denied any allegations of meddling. Carney's Apec meeting with Xi in South Korea comes one day after the Chinese president met Trump - the first between the two in six years.In that meeting on Thursday, Xi and Trump agreed to dial back their countries' trade war. No formal agreement has been signed, but the two signalled they are closer to a deal that would lower tariffs.",

    "body": "20 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorLatvian MPs have voted to withdraw from an international accord aimed at protecting women from violence, including domestic abuse, after a long and intense debate in parliament.Several thousand people protested against the vote this week in Riga. It is now up to President Edgars Rinkevics to decide whether to approve the law or not.Known as the Istanbul Convention, the 2011 treaty only came into force in Latvia last year, requiring governments to develop laws and support services to end all violence.Latvia is the first EU country to move towards pulling out of the treaty. Turkey withdrew in 2021, a move described as a huge setback by top human rights body  the Council of Europe.It is a setback for centre-right Prime Minister Evika Silina, who joined protesters outside parliament earlier this week. \"We will not give up, we will fight so that violence does not win,\" she told them.The treaty was ratified by the EU in 2023, however ultra-conservative groups have argued that the accord's focus on gender equality undermines family values and promotes \"gender ideology\".After a 13-hour debate in the Saeima, Latvian MPs voted by 56 to 32 to withdraw from the treaty, in a move sponsored by opposition parties but backed by politicians from one of the three coalition parties, the Union of Greens and Farmers.One of the main political groups behind the withdrawal is Latvia First, whose leader Ainars Slesers has called on Latvians to choose between a \"natural family\" and a \"gender ideology with multiple sexes\".Latvia's ombudswoman Karina Palkova called for the treaty not to be politicised, and the group Equality Now said it was \"not a threat to Latvian values, it was a tool to realise them\".Thursday's vote has prompted an outcry both within Latvia and beyond. Twenty-two thousand people have signed a Latvian petition not to drop the treaty. Women's rights group Centrs Marta has called a protest next Thursday, accusing MPs of not listening to the Latvian people.The head of the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly, Theodoros Rousopoulos, said Latvia had made a hasty decision fuelled by disinformation. It was, he said, an \"unprecedented and deeply worrying step backwards for women's rights and human rights in Europe\".Since Turkey abandoned the treaty four years ago, femicide and violence against women had risen sharply, he added.As the vote did not win a two-thirds majority, it means the president could return the bill for another reading, if he has objections. President Rinkevics said on X that he would assess the decision under the constitution, \"taking into account state and legal, rather than ideological or political, considerations\".Last week another member of the ruling coalition, the Progressives, said it would not rule out appealing to the Constitutional Court.Women are more likely to be victims of partner violence than men, according to the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE), an EU agency.In its latest figures, EIGE said 142 incidents of intimate partner violence against women were reported across Latvia in 2022. This was above the 109 offences recorded in 2021 but below the totals in the previous three years and during the Covid pandemic.",

    "body": "20 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorPierre Crom/Getty ImagesRob Jetten, 38, is now tipped to become the youngest prime minister in modern Dutch historyCentrist liberal leader Rob Jetten has claimed victory in Wednesday's nail-biting Dutch election, after vote analysis indicated his party could not be beaten by anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders.Jetten's D66 party currently has a narrow lead of 15,000 votes over Wilders' Freedom Party, and Dutch news agency ANP says even though the vote count is not complete, Wilders can no longer win.\"We are the biggest party in the Netherlands! Now we'll get to work for all Dutch people,\" Jetten posted on X. Wilders said it was the electoral council not a news agency that decided the result: \"What arrogance not to wait for that.\"Projections from about 99% of the vote put both parties on 26 seats in the 150-seat parliament - but ANP says Jetten's centrists could win a 27th seat.Jetten, 38, told reporters he was \"very proud of this historic result\" and now felt a great responsibility to form a stable and ambitious government.Wilders had led opinion polls going into Wednesday's election, but Rob Jetten succeeded in winning in some of the main Dutch cities including Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht with a positive campaign using a catchphrase of \"Yes, we can\". No Dutch election race has ever been so close, and if Jetten does become prime minister he will be the youngest in Dutch history.Until now Jetten was careful not to declare victory until all votes were in, but ANP said based on figures from postal voters abroad he could now be declared the winner.Wilders said even if D66 did go on to become the biggest party, his Freedom Party (PVV) would \"not let the Netherlands be broken up by Jetten and his people\".Jetten told reporters that his party had \"shown to the rest of Europe and the world that it is possible to beat the populist movements if you campaign with a positive message\".The Dutch electoral system is based on proportional representation in one nationwide constituency, so whichever party secures most votes wins most seats. Jetten's liberals have so far won 16.9% of the vote, while Wilders' Freedom Party is on 16.7%. As results came in on Thursday, the race was so close that the lead flipped between the two parties.In a sign that he was not ready to concede victory, Wilders dubbed the Dutch news agency \"ANP66\" and shared unfounded claims from social media of vote-rigging. One local authority, in Zaanstad outside Amsterdam, rejected the allegation as \"fabricated\".Although the D66 leader's path to forming a coalition is not straightforward, Jetten has said he wants to make a quick start.Jetten said after the vote that never before had a party won a Dutch election with fewer than 30 seats. He will need the support of at least three other parties to gather the 76 seats needed to form a coalition. The most obvious candidates would be the conservative-liberal VVD, the left-wing Labour (PvdA)-GreenLeft alliance and the Christian Democrats, but it could take months if that is to happen.VVD leader Dilan Yesilgöz has so far ruled out working with the left, but Jetten said he favoured a broad-based government from the centre of Dutch politics.The weekend would be a good chance for all the parties to reflect, before a \"scout\" is given the task next Tuesday of sounding them out. Jetten said he wanted to construct a coalition that represented best the millions of voters who had backed other parties to tackle the main issues, including the housing shortage and asylum and migration.His path to victory has stunned observers. Less than two years ago he led D66 - a party formed by democratic reformers in 1966 - to fifth place and just nine seats. Only a few weeks ago they were still languishing in the opinion polls, but gradually improved as Jetten put in several polished performances in TV debates and even  competed in the final of a TV quiz show 11 days before the election.Outgoing Prime Minister Dick Schoof predicted on Friday that Jetten's task of forming a coalition would prove complicated. \"I reckon I'll still be prime minister at Christmas - I'd be surprised if it happened [by then]\".Schoof, a former chief of Dutch intelligence, was picked for the top job by Geert Wilders, who abandoned his bid to lead the country last year because his prospective coalition partners would not support having a far-right prime minister.Wilders won the last election in November 2023, and a government was only formed in July 2024. Eleven months later, he brought his own government down, in a row with his coalition partners over asylum and migration policy.",

    "body": "1 day agoTabby WilsonWatch: Moment Spain's Sagrada Familia crowned world's tallest churchThe Sagrada Família has become the tallest church in the world, after workers placed the first part of a cross at the top of its central tower. Now measuring 162.91 metres tall, the Spanish basilica has officially pipped the record from the Ulm Minster in Germany, which has held the crown since 1890.Designed by acclaimed architect Antoni Gaudí, the place of worship has been under construction in the centre of Barcelona for more than a century, with the main building due to be completed next year. The central Tower of Jesus Christ will grow with the addition of the rest of the cross over the next few months, eventually standing at 172 metres tall. The first stone of the Sagrada Família was placed in 1882, with up-and-coming architect Gaudí taking over the project the following year. He transformed the original designs for the basilica into a far more ambitious proposal, which was initially funded by donations from repentant worshippers. At the time of his unexpected death in 1926, just one of the planned 18 towers had been built.In the years following, the construction of the architectural marvel was managed by the Sagrada Família foundation, and funded by contributions from tourists, visitors and private donors.Getty ImagesIn addition to the death of its primary architect, the basilica has hit a number of roadblocks throughout its almost 150-year construction. During the Spanish Civil War, Catalan anarchists set fire to the crypt, destroying plans and plaster models created by Gaudí that would guide future construction.Most recently, the Covid-19 pandemic saw construction on the building halted, with members of the foundation attributing the pause to a lack of tourism, and the subsequent drop in funding for the project.Behind the scenes of stunning La Sagrada FamiliaGaudí’s La Sagrada Família: Genius or folly?In September this year, Sagrada Família General Director Xavier Martínez told the Associated Press that the Tower of Jesus Christ would be completed in 2026, to coincide with the centenary of Gaudí's death.The foundation will hold a series of events to commemorate the architect, who is buried in the church's crypt.Work on decorative details, sculptures and a stairway leading to the building's main entrance is expected to continue over the next decade.",

    "body": "President Samia Suluhu Hassan has been declared the winner of Tanzania's presidential election, securing another term in office amid days of unrest across the country.According to the electoral commission, Samia won 98% of the votes, nearly sweeping the 32 million ballots cast in Wednesday's election.International observers have expressed concern over the lack of transparency and widespread turmoil that has reportedly left hundreds people dead and hundreds injured.The nationwide internet shutdown is making it difficult to verify the death toll. The government has sought to play down the scale of the violence - and authorities have extended a curfew in a bid to quell the unrest.\"I hereby announce Samia Suluhu Hassan as the winner of the presidential election under the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party,\" Jacobs Mwambegele, the electoral chief, said while announcing the results on Saturday morning.Samia secured about 31.9 million votes, or 97.66% of the total, with turnout nearing 87% of the country's 37.6 million registered voters, the electoral chief said. In Tanzania's semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar - which elects its own government and leader - CCM's Hussein Mwinyi, who is the incumbent president, won with nearly 80% of the vote.The opposition in Zanzibar said there had been \"massive fraud\", the AP news agency reported.Mwinyi's swearing-in ceremony is under way at Amaan Complex stadium in Zanzibar. Tanzania's first female president faces little oppositionWhy elections are a time of fear for albino TanzaniansHow Samia's hesitant reforms are fuelling Tanzanian political angerProtests continued on Friday, as demonstrators in the port city of Dar es Salaam and other cities took to the streets, tearing down Samia's posters and attacking police and polling stations despite warnings from the army chief to end the unrest.No protests were reported on Saturday morning, but tension remained high in Dar es Salaam, where security forces manned roadblocks across the city.The demonstrations are mostly led by young protesters, who have denounced the election as unfair.They accuse the government of undermining democracy by suppressing the main opposition leaders - one is in jail and another was excluded on technical grounds.A spokesperson from the opposition Chadema party on Friday told AFP news agency that \"around 700\" people had been killed in clashes with security forces, while a diplomatic source in Tanzania told the BBC there was credible evidence that at least 500 people had died.Foreign Minister Mahmoud Kombo Thabit has described the violence as a \"few isolated pockets of incidents here and there\" and said \"security forces acted very swiftly and decisively to address the situation\".In a statement, the UN chief Antonio Guterres said he was  \"deeply concerned\" about the situation in Tanzania, \"including reports of deaths and injuries during the demonstrations\". He urged all parties involved to \"prevent further escalation\".The UK, Canada and Norway have expressed similar concerns, citing \"credible reports of a large number of fatalities and significant injuries, as a result of the security response to protests\".There were two main opposition contenders - Tundu Lissu, who is being held on treason charges, which he denies, and Luhaga Mpina of the ACT-Wazalendo party - but he was excluded on legal technicalities.Sixteen fringe parties, none of whom have historically had significant public support, were allowed to run.Samia's ruling party, CCM, and its predecessor Tanu, have dominated the country's politics and have never lost an election since independence.Ahead of the election, rights groups condemned government repression, with Amnesty International citing a \"wave of terror\" involving enforced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings of opposition figures.The government rejected the claims, and officials said the election would be free and fair.Samia came into office in 2021 as Tanzania's first female president following the death of President John Magufuli.",

    "body": "20 hours agoMayeni Jones,Africa correspondent, Bernd Debusmann Jr,at the White House and Natasha BootyThe South African government has criticised the US's decision to prioritise refugee applications from white Afrikaners, saying claims of a white genocide have been widely discredited and lack reliable evidence.It highlighted an open letter published by prominent members of the Afrikaner community earlier this week rejecting the narrative, with some signatories calling the relocation scheme racist.The limited number of white South African Afrikaners signing up to relocate to the US was indication that they were not being persecuted, it added.On Thursday, the administration of US President Donald Trump announced its lowest refugee annual cap on record - to just 7,500.The exact figures of the number of white South Africans who have been admitted through the US scheme are not available. South Africa's latest crime statistics do not indicate that more white people have fallen victim to violent crime than other racial groups. Earlier this year President Trump offered refugee status to Afrikaners - who are mostly descendants of Dutch and French settlers - after South African President Cyril Ramaphosa signed a law allowing the government to seize land without compensation in rare instances. Is there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?Unpacking the South African land law that so inflames TrumpOn the road incorrectly identified as a 'burial site' by TrumpMost private farmland is owned by white South Africans who make up just over 7% of the population.Several months ago, South Africa's ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool, was expelled after accusing Trump of \"mobilising a supremacism\" and trying to \"project white victimhood as a dog whistle\".In the Oval Office in May, Trump confronted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa and claimed white farmers in his nation were being killed and \"persecuted\".President Trump held up a photo purporting to show body bags containing the remains of white people in South Africa, but the Reuters news agency later identified the photo as one of their own - taken thousands of miles away in the war-struck Democratic Republic of Congo.Washington did not comment on the claim that they had misidentified the image.The White House also played a video which they said showed burial sites for murdered white farmers. It later emerged that the videos were scenes from a 2020 protest in which the crosses represented farmers killed over multiple years.",

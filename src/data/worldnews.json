    "body": "The number of Indigenous people who have died in custody in Australia has hit the highest level since records began in 1980.New data from the Australian Institute of Criminology showed 33 of the 113 people who died in custody in the 12 months to June this year were Indigenous, up from 24 compared to the previous corresponding period.Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system, making up more than one-third of all prisoners, despite being less than four per cent of the country's population.The figures come more than three decades after a landmark inquiry into Indigenous deaths in custody which made hundreds of recommendations.Of the 33 Indigenous deaths in custody between last July and this June, 26 died while in prison custody, an increase from 18 in the previous 12-month period.One died in youth detention and all except one were male. The remaining six Indigenous deaths in custody happened in police custody, where someone has died while police were detaining or attempting to detain them.The main cause of Indigenous deaths was categorised as \"self-inflicted\" followed by \"natural causes,\" the report found. Hanging was found to be the cause in eight of the deaths.The Australian state of New South Wales recorded the highest number of Indigenous deaths in prison custody with nine, followed by Western Australia with six. Queensland, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory each had three deaths.The NSW state coroner recently described the rising number of Indigenous deaths in custody in her state as a \"profoundly distressing milestone\".In October, Magistrate Teresa O'Sullivan said the upward trend was not \"mere statistics\" and the deaths needed \"independent and careful scrutiny, respect and accountability\".The average age of Indigenous deaths in custody was 45 years, and 11 of those who died were awaiting a sentence.University of Melbourne associate professor of criminal law Amanda Porter told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that the figures reflected a \"national crisis\" that required \"leadership and political action\".Ms Porter, who has attended several coronial inquests with families of those that have died, said little had changed since the royal commission in 1991 that aimed to address the crisis.\"It's maddening to see the number of inquests that I attend, the number of funerals that families have to attend, and the fact that we are 30 years after the royal commission, and the situation is getting increasingly worse,\" she told the ABC.Since the royal commission, 600 Indigenous people have died in custody which includes six in youth detention, the report said.",

    "body": "7 hours agoAdam EastonBBC News Warsaw correspondentPolish authorities have arrested a prominent Russian academic from St Petersburg's world-famous Hermitage Museum who is sought by Ukraine for allegedly conducting illegal excavations and partially destroying the ancient city of Myrmekion in Crimea.The suspect, identified under Polish law as Aleksandr B, is the head of the Ancient Archaeology of the Northern Black Sea region at the museum, according to Ukrainian prosecutors.Ukrainian prosecutors accuse him of conducting illegal excavations at the site in Kerch between February 2014 and November 2025.\"As a result of these excavations, from 2014-2019, he illegally partially destroyed the 'Ancient City of Myrmekion' archaeological complex,\" Prosecutor Piotr Skiba, a spokesman for the Warsaw District Prosecutor's Office told the BBC, citing information from Ukrainian prosecutors.Ukraine estimates the damage at UAH 201.6 million ($4.77 million).Russia invaded Crimea in February 2014 and annexed it. Russia's foreign ministry identified the man as Alexander Butyagin, an employee of the State Hermitage Museum and condemned his detention.\"This is absolute legal tyranny. We will of course demand through diplomatic channels the right to protect the interests of our citizen,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.Myrmekion was an Ancient Greek colony founded by the Ionians in the first half of the Sixth Century BCE located in contemporary Crimea.Prosecutor Skiba said the man was detained in Poland on 4 December and was later questioned by prosecutors in Warsaw, \"where he refused to provide explanations\".The Ukrainian Prosecutor's Office issued an extradition request for Aleksandr B in November, Skiba said.According to the request: \"He searched for movable objects on cultural heritage sites without the appropriate permit to conduct excavations at the 'Ancient City of Myrmekion' archaeological complex in Kerch….and conducted illegal excavations at this cultural heritage site from the beginning of the temporary occupation of the territory of Crimea\".Russia's foreign ministry said Butyagin had been invited to deliver lectures on Pompeii in Warsaw and several other European cities.Warsaw District Court has agreed to remand Aleksandr B in custody at the Warsaw-Białołęka detention centre for 40 days until 13 January whilst the extradition process goes ahead.The Russian embassy in Warsaw has been informed of his arrest and pre-trial detention and are providing him with consular assistance, Prosecutor Skiba said.",

    "body": "6 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorThe government of Bulgarian Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov has resigned after protesters took to the streets in cities across the country and filled the centre of the capital Sofia on Wednesday night.Zhelyazkov's dramatic move came ahead of a vote of no confidence in parliament, and 20 days before Bulgaria joins the euro.Protesters had accused his minority centre-right government, in power since January, of widespread corruption. The government had already scrapped a controversial budget plan for next year in response to the demonstrations last week.\"We hear the voice of citizens protesting against the government,\" Zhelyazkov said in a TV address.\"Both young and old have raised their voices for [our resignation],\" he added. \"This civic energy must be supported and encouraged.\" A statement on the government website said ministers would continue in their roles until a new cabinet was elected.Between 50,000 and 100,000 people turned out in Sofia's central Triangle of Power and Independence Square on Wednesday evening calling for the government to go. The words \"Resignation\" and \"Mafia Out\" were projected onto the parliament building.They were backed last week by President Rumen Radev who had also called on the government to stand down.Zhelyazkov's government had already survived five votes of no confidence and was expected to get through a sixth on Thursday.Many of the protesters have been angered by the roles of two figures, oligarch Delyan Peevski and ex-prime minister Boyko Borissov, and Wednesday's rally was organised under the slogan \"Resignation! Peevski and Borissov Out of Power\",  Bulgaria's BTA news agency reported.Peevski has been sanctioned by the US and UK for alleged corruption and his party has helped prop up the government.Borissov is part of Zhelyazkov's Gerb party, which came first in October 2024 elections, and he was reported to have said on Wednesday that the coalition parties had agreed to remain in power until Bulgaria joined the eurozone on 1 January.Borissov was prime minister when anti-corruption protests brought down his government in 2020 and there have been seven elections since.Despite the political drama in Sofia, Bulgaria's move to join the euro is not seen as under threat.In his resignation statement, the outgoing prime minister said Bulgaria faced a major challenge and its citizens would need to produce \"authentic proposals\" on what the next government should look like.Bulgaria ranks among the highest in Europe in terms of the public's perception of official corruption, according to Transparency International.",

    "body": "7 hours agoBethany BellVienna correspondent Austria has passed a law banning headscarves in schools for girls under the age of 14.The conservative-led coalition of three centrist parties, the ÖVP, the SPÖ and the Neos, says the law is a \"clear commitment to gender equality\", but critics say it will fuel anti-Muslim feeling in the country and could be unconstitutional.The measure will apply to girls in both public and private schools.In 2020, a similar headscarf ban for girls under 10 was struck down by the Constitutional Court, because it specifically targeted Muslims.The terms of the new law mean girls under 14 will be forbidden from wearing \"traditional Muslim\" head coverings such as hijabs or burkas.If a student violates the ban, they must have a series of discussions with school authorities and their legal guardians. If there are repeated violations, the child and youth welfare agency must be notified.As a last resort, families or guardians could be fined up to €800 (£700).Members of the government say this is about empowering young girls, arguing it is to protect them \"from oppression\".Speaking ahead of the vote, the parliamentary leader of the liberal Neos party, Yannick Shetty said it was \"not a measure against a religion. It is a measure to protect the freedom of girls in this country,\" and added that the ban would affect about 12,000 children.The opposition far-right Freedom Party of Austria, the FPÖ, which voted in favour of the ban, said it did not go far enough.It described the ban as \"a first step\", which should be widened to include all pupils and school staff.\"There needs to be a general ban on headscarves in schools; political Islam has no place here\", the FPÖ's spokesperson on families Ricarda Berger said.Sigrid Maurer from the opposition Greens called the new law \"clearly unconstitutional\".The official Islamic Community in Austria, the IGGÖ, said the ban violated fundamental rights and would split society.In a statement  on its website, it said  \"instead of empowering children, they will be stigmatised and marginalised.\"The IGGÖ said it would review \"the constitutionality of the law and take all necessary steps.\"\"The Constitutional Court already ruled unequivocally in 2020 that such a ban is unconstitutional, as it specifically targets a religious minority and violates the principle of equality,\" the IGGÖ said.The government says it has tried to avoid that.\"Will it pass muster with the Constitutional Court? I don't know. We have done our best,\" Shetty said.An awareness-raising trial period will start in February 2026, with the ban fully going into force next September - the beginning of the new school year.",

    "body": "A judge has ordered the immediate release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported and brought back to the US to face criminal charges, from immigration custody.US District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland said since returning to the US, Mr Abrego Garcia was re-detained \"without lawful authority\". The order means he can at least temporarily return to his home in Maryland.The Department of Homeland Security said the decision was \"naked judicial activism\" and \"lacks any valid legal basis\".The case became a focal point in the administration's crackdown on immigration after he was deported to El Salvador in March, despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation. Judge Xinis wrote in her ruling that the government did not have a removal order, which blocks it from deporting Mr Abrego Garcia \"at this juncture\".Mr Abrego Garcia, who is married to a US citizen and has been living in Maryland for years, illegally came to the US from El Salvador when he was a teenager. The Trump administration has alleged Mr Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 criminal organisation, which he has denied. In 2019, he was arrested with three other men in Maryland and detained by federal immigration authorities. At the time, the judge granted him protection from deportation on the grounds that he could face persecution by a gang in his home country.He was returned to the US in June, where he was arrested and taken to Tennessee to face human smuggling charges. He has pleaded not guilty.Mr Abrego Garcia was then released from jail in Tennessee and into the custody of his brother in Maryland. He was told to check in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), where he was taken into custody. Judge Xinis on Thursday said he must now follow the conditions of his release from jail in Tennessee, and cannot be removed from the country.The judge had initially temporarily barred the government from removing him to a third country while she heard his challenge to the detention. In her order, Judge Xinis said the government had said it was considering removing him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and later Liberia. Costa Rica offered to take Mr Abrego Garcia, the judge said, but the government did not accept its offer.In her 31-page order on Thursday, the judge wrote that immigration detention cannot be used for punishment or go on indefinitely. She said the first three African countries had never been \"viable options\", while Costa Rica \"had never wavered in its commitment to receive Abrego Garcia, just as Abrego Garcia never wavered in his commitment to resettle there\".\"Whatever purpose was behind his detention, it was not for the 'basic purpose' of timely third-country removal,\" she wrote.",

    "body": "Residents in the Pacific Northwest of the US and Canada are bracing for what could be record-setting floods as an atmospheric river dumps heavy rain on already swollen rivers.On Thursday, the National Water Center reported major, in some cases record, flooding along the Skagit and Snohomish rivers in the state of Washington that is expected to continue through Friday. In Canada, major highways to Vancouver have been closed because of flooding, debris and the risk of avalanches.There are evacuation orders in place for thousands of people in the US and Canada, and authorities have warned more rain is on the way.In the US, the governor of Washington state, Bob Ferguson, declared a statewide emergency on Wednesday and estimated 100,000 residents could soon face evacuation orders.The emergency declaration warned that continued rain and snow at mountain elevations would exacerbate flooding conditions. Supply chains and transportation could be severely impacted, the declaration added.Skagit County, a major agricultural area north of Seattle, has issued an immediate evacuation order to residents who live on the floodplain.Some 75,000 people would be evacuated from low-lying areas on Skagit River, the director of the Washington Military Department's Emergency Management Division, Robert Ezelle, told reporters on Wednesday.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, said on Thursday that the Skagit River will cause \"severe near-record flooding from Rockport downstream through Sedro Woolley\".It warned of \"deep and swift flood waters\" especially in the Cape Horn, Hamilton and Thunderbird regions. The Snohomish County Sheriff's Office said in an overnight social media post that they had rescued \"multiple\" people by helicopter after they became trapped in their homes in Sultan, Washington, a community roughly 40 miles (65km) northeast of Seattle. The sheriff's office warned residents on Thursday morning that the eastern region of the county is most affected after the Skykomish River crested above 24ft (7m) overnight - just shy of a record. They said the Snohomish River is also experiencing major flooding and \"dancing with records\" as  water laps against a local flood wall.King county and Snohomish county officials have said there are multiple closures on state and local roads, with more likely on Thursday. The Pierce County Sheriff's office said in an video post on Wednesday that a swiftwater team had to rescue three people from an RV park on Orting, a community about 42 miles south of Seattle. Multiple roads are also closed in that county. In a post on X on Thursday, Pierce County Sheriff Keith Swank said \"this flooding is the worst I have seen here\" in the county.Across the border in Canada's British Columbia, there are evacuation orders in place for the communities of Tulameen and Eastgate, and several other areas.The City of Abbotsford ordered urgent evacuations for 371 properties at 23:00 local time on Wednesday (07:00 GMT on Thursday).City officials said the Nooksack River was expected to overflow its banks early on Thursday, and they anticipate flooding, though not as severe as in 2021, when it caused  significant damage and five deaths in the province. Most major highways to the Lower Mainland are now closed, according to the travel-information website Drive BC.  The US-Canada Sumas Border Crossing is also closed to commercial traffic. The entire region, spanning parts of both the US and Canada, has received torrential rain from an atmospheric river, which is a phenomenon where water evaporates into the air and is carried by the wind and forms long currents that surge through the sky like rivers flow on land.The heaviest rainfall is expected to subside by Thursday afternoon, but the water will continue to work its way into rivers.Another storm is expected on Sunday.

    "body": "52 minutes agoLaura GozziReutersThe US has proposed Ukraine withdraw from the eastern Donetsk region and create a \"special economic zone\" in the areas it currently controls, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.Zelensky said territory and control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remained the two main unresolved issues in the peace plan proposal for Ukraine.In a sobering briefing to reporters, Zelensky addressed the US desire for a quick end to the conflict, the complex nature of the ongoing negotiations, and his belief that Russia had no desire to stop the war.Ukraine has sent the US an updated 20-point plan plus separate documents on security guarantees and provisions for Ukraine's reconstruction, Zelensky said.It follows weeks of high-level diplomatic activity which has seen several peace plans drawn up, adjusted and revised by the US, Ukraine, Russia and European leaders.\"The final mile is the hardest. Everything could fall apart for many reasons,\" Zelensky said on Thursday. Russia demands that Ukraine relinquishes control of roughly 30% of the eastern Donetsk region it still holds - something Ukraine has refused to do, both on principle and because it fears it would allow Moscow a foothold for future invasions.According to Zelensky, the US is now envisaging a solution that would see Ukrainian forces withdraw from parts of Donetsk, and Russian forces committing to not advancing into the territory. This area would become a \"special economic zone\" or a \"demilitarised zone\", Zelensky said.However, he noted that it would not be fair for the Ukrainians to withdraw unilaterally, and that Russia should also pull back by the same distance. \"What will restrain [Russia] from advancing? Or from infiltrating disguised as civilians?\" he asked.Zelensky said these were \"very serious concerns\" and that Ukraine might not accept the proposal at all – although he opened the door to elections or a referendum to give the Ukrainian people a choice.But he acknowledged that the fighting would continue and may yet shape the future of the negotiations: \"Much depends on our military – what they can hold, where they can stop the enemy, what they can destroy. This affects the entire configuration.\"The management of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was another highly contentious point, Zelensky said.The power plant – Europe's largest – sits on the front line and has been under Russian control since March 2022. Zelensky said a possible solution would be for the Russians to withdraw and Kyiv to share control of the plant with the Americans – although he acknowledged that the details of such an arrangement were still unclear, and it is doubtful that Moscow would agree.US President Donald Trump appears to have grown frustrated with the intricacies of the conflict, and Kyiv and its allies fear the Americans might eventually seek to impose a Russian-led solution on Ukraine.Zelensky told reporters that although the Americans wanted a \"quicker conclusion\" to the war, there were no deadlines for an agreement. Ukraine - which is targeted by widespread aerial attacks on a near-nightly basis - has been pushing for respite and would want an immediate ceasefire to be implemented ahead of a more laborious agreement being fleshed out.But Russia stands to gain more from a ceasefire being delayed, as its troops continue to make small but incremental gains on the frontline and its attacks exhaust the Ukrainian population.\"After multiple rounds of talks with Russia\" the Americans were now aligned on Moscow on this position, Zelensky said. Kremlin officials have been more tight-lipped than their European, US and Ukrainian counterparts. However, whenever possible, Russia has sought to cement the impression that Moscow and Washington are aligned on their hopes for the terms of a peace deal.On Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov praised Trump for trying to broker a deal and said a recent meeting between President Vladimir Putin and US envoy Steve Witkoff at the Kremlin had \"eliminated\" the \"misunderstandings\" between the two sides.The foreign minister also batted off suggestions that Kyiv could be given security guarantees in the form of foreign troops stationed in Ukraine.\"This is yet another return to the sad logic of Zelensky's so-called peace formula,\" Lavrov said, adding that Moscow had handed the US \"additional\" proposals on collective security and that Russia was ready to give legal guarantees not to attack Nato or EU countries.But neither Ukraine nor Europe will be likely to take any promise by Moscow at face value, given Russia has previously violated ceasefires and truce deals.European and Ukrainian officials want the US to be involved in giving security guarantees so that Kyiv doesn't become the target of renewed attacks.Zelensky said he had received a draft proposal on American security guarantees but that the draft was a work in progress, suggesting that what has been offered by the US falls short of provisions that could assuage Kyiv's fears.\"The US does not want Ukraine in Nato. They say this openly... So I do not think they have difficulties discussing Nato with the Russians,\" Zelensky said.Zelensky also said Ukraine had to be \"cautious\", adding: \"We do not know what other agreements the US may have with Russia. We will learn in time.\" Ukraine's president also acknowledged that US support for Kyiv may one day end, both in terms of the flow of weapons that the US is selling through other countries and in terms of intelligence sharing. Reflecting the fraught nature of the talks and his scepticism that Russia was negotiating in good faith, Zelensky told reporters: \"No one knows what may happen the day after tomorrow... We do not know how these negotiations will end.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoJoshua Cheetham, Paul Brown, Richard Irvine-Brown & Matt MurphyBBC Verify    BBCThe oil tanker seized by US forces on Wednesday had a track record of faking or concealing its location information, apparently to hide its activities, ship tracking data shows.On Wednesday evening, the US confirmed that its forces seized a vessel during a helicopter-launched raid near the coast of Venezuela. BBC Verify confirmed the ship was the Skipper by matching a sign seen in footage released by the US to a reference photo supplied by TankerTrackers.com, a site which monitors oil shipments.Data held by publicly accessible tracking sites paints an incomplete picture of the vessel's movements, and before its seizure it hadn't declared its position since 7 November. Maritime analytics firm Kpler also suggested that the vessel had engaged in a ship-to-ship transfer. US Attorney General Pam Bondi described the vessel as a \"crude oil tanker used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran\".The US Treasury department first sanctioned the ship in 2022, when it was sailing under the name Adisa, and was accused of being part of an \"international oil smuggling network\".The Skipper has sailed under the flag of Guyana, but the government was quick to release a statement saying that the 20-year-old tanker was \"falsely flying the Guyana Flag as it is not registered in Guyana\".Experts told BBC Verify that the Skipper was likely a part of the so-called \"dark fleet\" - a global network of oil tankers that seek to evade oil sanctions by obscuring their ownership, identities and travel histories.Hiding its positionUnder a UN treaty, all ships above a certain tonnage must have an onboard tracker called an Automatic Identification System (AIS). These trackers broadcast information about the ships, including their location, and can be followed on websites like MarineTraffic.But there is an incomplete and misleading public record of the Skipper's movements. According to MarineTraffic, the Skipper's last known port call was at Soroosh in Iran on 9 July, where it arrived after stopping in Iraq and the UAE.But Kpler suggests that this is part of a pattern of misleading entries by the Skipper. Analysts at the firm said the ship had previously loaded crude oil from Venezuela and Iran, while falsifying its position via its onboard tracker, a process known as spoofing.Venezuela has some of the world's largest reserves of oil, but exports were placed under sanctions in 2019 by the US in a bid to force the transition of power from President Nicholas Maduro's administration, which has been widely accused of election rigging.The firm noted that while its AIS showed the ship at Iraq's Basrah Oil Terminal on 7 and 8 July, terminal reports showed no record of the vessel there. Instead, the Skipper loaded crude oil at Kharg Island in Iran, Kpler said.The Skipper then sailed east, tracking data shows, where Kpler suggested it conducted a ship-to-ship transfer between 11 and 13 August. The cargo was later unloaded in China, where Kpler said it was \"falsely declared\".It returned via Iran and sailed towards the Caribbean. The Skipper last declared its position on 7 November, several miles off the coast of Guyana. Its location only reappeared on 10 December, after the US raid.In the interim period, satellite images identified by TankerTrackers.com and confirmed by BBC Verify show that the Skipper was present in the Port of Jose in Venezuela on 18 November and not appearing on tracking sites at the time.Since the imposition of sanctions, analysts say it has become common for ships to spoof or conceal their positions while loading oil in Venezuela.Kpler analysts said the ship loaded \"at least 1.1 million barrels of Merey crude\" by 16 November at the terminal and listed Cuba as the destination.There is also evidence that the Skipper was involved in a ship-to-ship transfer with another vessel on 7 December, just days before it was boarded by US troops. Satellite images seen by Kpler appeared to show the exchange, with one of the vessels identified by Kpler as the Skipper.The transfer took place just off the coast of Venezuela, near the city of Barcelona. According to MarineTraffic, the Skipper had last appeared off the coast of Guyana weeks earlier.Kpler told BBC Verify that between 28 October and 4 December, the Skipper broadcasted \"manipulated\" AIS signals which did not reflect its actual location.Such sanction evading activity is not unusual for Venezuelan oil exports, Kpler said. The company said that tankers often transfer their cargo off the coast of Malaysia, before the oil is imported into China.Former Belgian naval lieutenant and analyst Frederik Van Lokeren told BBC Verify that while such ship-to-ship transfers are not illegal or wrong, they are \"extremely uncommon\". He said such activities were normally a sign of vessels trying to evade sanctions, transferring oil to ships not publicly associated with smuggling.Mr Van Lokeren said that Venezuela's refining capacity has been significantly degraded in recent years and is \"dependent\" on its allies in Iran and Russia to convert its crude oil into more commercially lucrative products.Who owns the Skipper?MarineTraffic lists the beneficial owner and operator as Nigeria-based Thomarose Global Ventures Ltd and it lists the registered owner as Marshall Islands-based Triton Navigation Corp.In 2022, the US Treasury said that Triton was being used by a sanctioned Russian oil magnate - Viktor Artemov - to facilitate a global \"oil smuggling network\".At the time, US officials said Mr Artemov used an expansive network of ships often registered obscurely to transport Iranian oil.In its statement, the US Treasury said that Triton had \"materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, Artemov\".BBC Verify is attempting to contact both companies for comment.

    "body": "At least 34 people have died and dozens more are injured after air strikes from Myanmar's military hit a hospital in the country's west on Wednesday night, according to ground sources.The hospital is located in Mrauk-U town in Rakhine state, an area controlled by the Arakan Army - one of the strongest ethnic armies fighting the country's military regime.Thousands have died and millions have been displaced since the military seized power in a coup in 2021 and triggered a civil war.In recent months, the military has intensified air strikes to take back territory from ethnic armies. It has also deployed paragliders to drop bombs on its enemies.The Myanmar military has not commented on the strikes, which come as the country prepares to vote later this month in its first election since the coup.However, pro-military accounts on Telegram claim the strikes this week were not aimed at civilians.Khaing Thukha, a spokesperson for the Arakan Army, told the BBC that most of the casualties were patients at the hospital.\"This is the latest vicious attack by the terrorist military targeting civilian places,\" he said, adding that the military \"must take responsibility\" for bombing civilians.The Arakan Army health department said the strike, which occurred at around 21:00 (14:30 GMT), killed 10 patients on the spot and injured many others.Photos believed to be from the scene have been circulating on social media showing missing roofs across parts of the building complex, broken hospital beds and debris strewn across the ground.The junta has been locked in a years-long bloody conflict with ethnic militias, at one point losing control of more than half the country.But recent influx of technology and equipment from China and Russia seems to have helped it turn the tide. The junta has made significant gains through a campaign of airstrikes and heavy bombardment. Earlier this year, more than 20 people were killed after an army motorised paraglider dropped two bombs on a crowd protesting at a religious festival.Civil liberties have also shrunk dramatically under the junta. Tens of thousands of political dissidents have been arrested, rights groups estimate.Myanmar's junta has called for a general election on 28 December, touting it as a pathway to political stability. But critics say the election will be neither free nor fair, but will instead offer the junta a guise of legitimacy. Tom Andrews, the United Nations' human rights expert on Myanmar, has called it a \"sham election\".In recent weeks the junta has arrested civilians accused of disrupting the vote, including one man who authorities said had sent out anti-election messages on Facebook.The junta also said on Monday that it was looking for 10 activists involved in an anti-election protest.Ethnic armies and other opposition groups have pledged to boycott the polls.At least one election candidate in in central Myanmar's Magway Region was detained by an anti-junta group, the Associated Press reported.",

    "body": "6 hours agoCaroline Davies,Pakistan correspondentandTom BennettPakistan's former spy chief has been sentenced to 14 years in prison by a military court, on charges including violation of state secrets and interfering in politics.Faiz Hameed led Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency from 2019 to 2021, during the tenure of now-jailed former prime minister Imran Khan.He was known to be a staunch supporter of Khan, and took early retirement shortly after Khan was ousted in a no-confidence vote in 2022.It is the first time that an ISI chief in Pakistan has been court martialled. His lawyer said he plans to appeal against the verdict.The ISI chief is seen as the second most powerful position in Pakistan's military.According to a press release issued by the public relations arm of Pakistani military (ISPR), the 15-month-long court martial proceeding began on August 12, 2024, under the Pakistan Army Act.Hameed was tried on four charges, including \"involvement in political activities, violation of the Official Secrets Act which harmed the interest of the state, misuse of his powers and government resources, and causing harm to citizens\".The ISPR statement added that Hameed had been given \"the right to have a defence team of his choice\" and that he has the right to appeal the decision in the \"appropriate forum\", which would be the Supreme Court of Pakistan.The exact details of the case are not public as the hearing was held behind closed doors in a military court.The statement says that Hameed's alleged involvement in fomenting political agitation and instability is being dealt with separately.This is assumed to be regarding allegations that Hameed was tied to protests against Imran Khan's arrest on 9 May 2023.Hameed's lawyer, Mian Ali Ashfaq, said his client was \"1,000% innocent, but this is the court's decision\".\"We were unaware of the judgement and only found out through the ISPR's press release. We are now applying to the relevant forum for a copy of the decision,\" he told the BBC. \"As soon as we receive it, we will review it and immediately file a petition to appeal. Right now, the first forum for appeal is the army chief, so that is what we will do. We are hopeful that at the next forum we will present our case and obtain justice.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoKayla EpsteinandIone Wells,São PauloWatch: Video shows US military seizing oil tanker off Venezuela coastUS forces have seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, marking a sharp escalation in Washington's pressure campaign against Nicolás Maduro's government.Speaking at the White House on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said the tanker was \"the largest one ever seized\".Footage released by the US government showed armed soldiers boarding the vessel, which Attorney General Pam Bondi said was used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran.Caracas swiftly denounced the action, calling it an act of \"international piracy\". Earlier, President Nicolás Maduro declared that Venezuela would never become an \"oil colony\".The Trump administration accuses Venezuela of funnelling narcotics into the US and has intensified its efforts to isolate President Maduro in recent months. Venezuela - home to some of the world's largest proven oil reserves - has, in turn, accused Washington of seeking to steal its resources.Brent crude prices inched higher on Wednesday as news of the seizure stoked short-term supply concerns. Analysts warn the move could threaten shippers and further disrupt Venezuela's oil exports.On Thursday, the Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin had spoken with Maduro and reassured him of Moscow's support \"in the face of growing external pressure\".Bondi, who leads the US Department of Justice, said the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and the US Coast Guard co-ordinated the seizure.\"For multiple years, the oil tanker has been sanctioned by the United States due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations,\" the nation's top prosecutor wrote on X.Footage shared by Bondi showed a military helicopter hovering over a large ship, and troops descending on to the deck using ropes. Uniformed men were seen in the clip moving about the ship with guns drawn.A senior military official told the BBC's US partner CBS that the helicopters used in the operation launched from the USS Gerald Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, which was sent to the Caribbean last month.It involved two helicopters, 10 Coast Guard members and 10 Marines, as well as special forces.Watch: Venezuela’s Maduro sings \"Don't worry, be happy\" as he calls for peace with the USDefence Secretary Pete Hegseth was aware of the operation, and the Trump administration was considering more actions like this, a source told CBS.When asked by reporters what the US would do with the oil on the tanker, Trump said: \"We keep it, I guess... I assume we're going to keep the oil.\" Maritime risk company Vanguard Tech identified the vessel as the Skipper and said it believed the ship had been \"spoofing\" its position - or broadcasting a false location - for a long time.BBC Verify has since confirmed that the vessel in the footage released by the Department of Homeland Security is the Skipper.The US treasury department sanctioned the Skipper in 2022, CBS reported, for alleged involvement in oil smuggling that generated revenue for Hezbollah and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force.BBC Verify also located this tanker on MarineTraffic, which shows it was sailing under the flag of Guyana when its position was last updated two days ago. A statement from Guyana's Maritime Administration Department on Wednesday evening, however, said that the Skipper was \"falsely flying the Guyana Flag as it is not registered in Guyana.\"The Skipper's port of call log shows it called in Iran, Iraq, and the UAE from 30 June to 9 July this year. Its most recent stop, according to MarineTraffic, was at Soroosh port in Iran on 9 July.That does not mean that it has not called at multiple other ports since then.MarineTraffic shows it was last near Iran in mid-September before arriving off the coast of Guyana at the end of October and making minimal further movement since then. This data may be partial or incorrect because of spoofing.MarineTraffic lists the beneficial owner and operator as Nigeria-based Thomarose Global Ventures Ltd and it lists the registered owner as Marshall Islands-based Triton Navigation Corp.Watch: Trump says US has seized \"large tanker\" off Venezuela coastThe Venezuelan government issued a statement denouncing the seizure as a \"grave international crime\".Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello called the US \"murderers, thieves, pirates\".He referred to Pirates of the Caribbean, but said that while that film's lead character Jack Sparrow was a \"hero\", he believed \"these guys are high seas criminals, buccaneers\".Cabello said this was how the US had \"started wars all over the world\".Speaking at a rally earlier on Wednesday, Maduro had a message for Americans opposed to war with Venezuela. It came in the form of a 1988 hit song.\"To American citizens who are against the war, I respond with a very famous song: Don't worry, be happy,\" Maduro said in Spanish before singing along to the lyrics of the 1988 hit.\"Not war, be happy. Not, not crazy war, not, be happy.\"It's unclear if Maduro knew about the seizure of the tanker before this rally.In recent days, the US has ramped up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea, which borders Venezuela to the north.The build-up involves thousands of troops and the USS Gerald Ford being positioned within striking distance of Venezuela, BBC Verify reported. The move has sparked speculation about the potential for some kind of military action.Since September, the US has conducted at least 22 strikes on boats in the region that the Trump administration says are smuggling drugs. At least 80 people have died in these attacks.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

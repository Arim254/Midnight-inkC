Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has accused the Trump administration of an \"authoritarian march\" and said the state would \"use every lever at our disposal to stop this power grab\".</p><p>Sources told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that some troops could begin their assignments as early as Wednesday. </p></div><div><p>CBS also reported that trailers have been set up as temporary living quarters on the Army Reserve Training Center about 50 miles (80km) south-west of Chicago. </p><p>Fencing was also put up around the training facility late on Tuesday.</p><p>Local officials have said they have received few details on the troop assignments. </p><p>Trump argues the use of the troops is necessary to quell violence in Democratic-controlled cities, crack down on crime and support his deportation initiatives.</p><p>National Guard troops have limited power. They do not enforce the law, or make arrests, seizures, or searches - their role is instead about protecting federal officers and property.</p><p>Trump has already sent guard members into Los Angeles and Washington, DC, and has ordered them to enter Memphis and Portland. </p><p>A federal judge temporarily barred troops from deploying to Portland, however.

It also called for the release of political prisoners including Aung San Suu Kyi, the democratically-elected leader who was deposed in the coup and jailed. </p><p>The Sagaing region has been a key battleground in the war, with large parts of it under the control of volunteer militias.</p><p>These groups, known as the People's Defence Force (PDF), also run the local administration. An official in the local PDF told BBC Burmese that they had received information about a potential airborne attack during Monday's gathering.</p><p>They tried to end the protest quickly, but the paramotors - as paragliders are known locally - reached the scene earlier than expected, he said.</p><p>It all happened in seven minutes, he said. He says the explosion injured his leg, but some people near him were killed. </p><p>Locals said it was hard to identify the bodies in the aftermath.</p><p>\"Children were completely torn apart,\" another woman who had helped to organise the event told AFP news agency. She was not at the scene but attended funerals on Tuesday, and added that they were still \"collecting body parts\".</p></div><div><p>In a statement on Tuesday, Amnesty International said that the junta's use of motorised paragliders to attack communities was part of a \"disturbing trend\". </p><p>BBC Burmese recently reported that the junta were increasingly opting for paramotors amid a lack of aircraft and helicopters, as well as jet fuel. </p><p>International sanctions over the past few years have made it harder for Myanmar's rulers to procure military equipment - though the recent influx of technology from countries like China and Russia seems to have helped turned the tide. </p><p>Joe Freeman, Amnesty International's Myanmar researcher, said the attack \"should serve as a gruesome wake-up call that civilians in Myanmar need urgent protection\".</p><p>He also called on Asean, the South East Asian regional bloc due to convene later this month, to \"increase pressure on the junta and revise an approach that has failed the Myanmar people for almost five years\".</p><p>Myanmar is scheduled to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg3pp4n952o\">hold general elections in December</a>, the first vote since the 2021 coup. Critics, however, say the vote will not be free and fair and is aimed at trying to legitimise military rule. Many opposition parties have been banned, and voting is likely to take place in only about half the country, in the areas the military controls.</p></div>",

Legal cases have recently been filed in Illinois and Oregon.</p><p>As the legal battles continue, here's what to know.</p></div><p></p><h2>What is the National Guard and who oversees it?</h2><p></p><div><p>The National Guard consists of primarily state-based troops that typically respond to major issues like natural disasters or large protests.</p><p>All 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands have their own contingent of National Guard troops. Those troops also can be deployed abroad, and some units specialise in fighting wildfires or securing the US border.</p><p>Guard members ultimately report to the Department of Defence, and can be federalised - or brought under the control of the president - under certain circumstances. However, requests for its support normally start at a state level. </p><p>In those circumstances, the governor of a state activates guard troops during an emergency, and can request additional help from the president or other states.</p><p>National Guard troops have limited power. They do not enforce the law, or make arrests, seizures, or searches. A law called the Posse Comitatus Act limits the power of the federal government to use military force for domestic matters.</p></div><p></p><h2>How is Trump trying to use the National Guard in US cities?</h2><p></p><div><p>Trump has tried to circumvent the normal process for deploying the National Guard several times now - including with his efforts to order guard members from one state into a different state.</p><p>In June, he took control of the California National Guard to respond to protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles, even though Governor Gavin Newsom objected. </p><p>California filed two cases against the Trump administration. One of these challenged Trump's seizure of the National Guard, but an appeals court ultimately ruled in favour of the president. In a second case, a federal judge found that Trump's use of the guard troops in Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act.</p><p>Over the summer, hundreds of National Guard troops were sent into Washington DC, to respond to what Trump called a \"situation of complete and total lawlessness\". The president cited homelessness and crime rates as justification.</p><p>Trump has now authorised the deployment of 300 guard members to Chicago following immigration protests, particularly outside detention facilities. Officers who were sent from Texas have now arrived at a training centre near Chicago.</p><p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, has alleged Trump is trying to \"manufacture a crisis\", and has filed a legal case of his own.</p><p>Trump also attempted to deploy National Guard members from other states to Portland, in Oregon, before a federal judge temporarily blocked him.</p></div><div><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2dnk0ee6pyo\">Trump authorises deployment of 300 National Guard to Chicago</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yenwklgdyo\">'I sleep with a gas mask on': Life next to Portland protest angering Trump</a></li></ul></div><p></p><h2>What legal basis does Trump use to deploy the National Guard?</h2><p></p><div><p>A little-known provision of US military law governs the president's authority to deploy the National Guard on his own. Until now, presidents have rarely used it.</p><p>American law allows the president to call National Guard troops from any state into service if the US is \"invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation\", or \"there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion\" against the US government.</p><p>Trump invoked this law to bring 2,000 National Guard troops under his control in June in order to support raids led by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p><p>Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth also cited the law in a memo deploying 200 members of the Oregon National Guard into federal service on 28 September.</p><p>\"We're very confident in the president's legal authority to do this,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on 6 October. \"And we're very confident we will win on the merits of the law.\"</p></div><p></p><h2>Why does Trump want to use the National Guard in Portland?</h2><p></p><div><p>Trump is again seeking to use the National Guard to respond to demonstrations, after protests near an ICE building in Portland in early October. </p><p>Federal officers, including with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Customs and Border Patrol agency (CBP), clashed with demonstrators who opposed Trump's mass deportation initiative.</p><p>Trump has claimed the city is \"burning down,\" but Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, a Democrat, said \"there is no insurrection in Portland, no threat to national security.\"</p><p>The Trump administration has moved to send 200 California National Guard troops to neighbouring Oregon to respond to the protests. But US District Judge Karin Immergut, who Trump appointed during his first term, has temporarily blocked this.</p><p>On Saturday, Judge Immergut blocked Trump from federalising the Oregon National Guard. \"This is a nation of constitutional law, not martial law,\" she wrote in her ruling. The next day, she issued a temporary restraining order against Trump deploying California's National Guard in Portland instead. </p><p>The Trump administration is expected to appeal.</p></div></article>",

Hundreds of local villagers and rescue workers have been deployed to clear out snow blocking access to the area, which sits at an altitude of more than 4,900m (16,000ft). </p><p>Rescuers have guided 350 people to safety in the small township of Qudang. Authorities are in contact with all the hikers who are still trapped.</p></div><div><p>Nature photographer Dong Shuchang was among hundreds of tourists who flocked to the area during China's Golden Week holiday. </p><p>He was looking forward to capturing the Himalayan marvel from the Tibetan slopes, when the snowstorm hit just hours after his trek started on Saturday.</p><p>\"The lightning and thunderstorms would not stop. The snowfall was so heavy I could hardly sleep,\" Mr Dong explained.</p><p>His group had reached an altitude of 4,600m before they decided to turn back.  </p><p>\"Our windbreakers and raincoats were no match for the snow. We were all drenched,\" he said, adding that several people in his group of 20 showed signs of hypothermia.</p><p>The 27-year-old had been to the Himalayas more than a dozen times, but said he has \"never experienced weather like this\". </p><p>Mr Dong's escape from the trail was lined with wet snow and falling sleet.</p><p>\"Everyone was moving slowly. The route was very slippery. I kept falling because of the ice.\"</p><p>His group spent last night in a hotel room in Qudang, where they relied on a generator for electricity. </p><p>When they left the hotel this morning, the snowstorm had finally subsided.</p><p>\"We're just so relieved to get help and support,\" he said.</p><p>Chen Geshuang, who was part of Mr Dong's hiking group, said the snow was about a metre deep when the group started their retreat on Sunday.</p><p>\"All of us are experienced hikers,\" Ms Chen said. \"But this blizzard was still extremely difficult to deal with. I was so lucky to get out.\"</p><p>\"This year's snow was exceptional,\" the 29-year-old outdoor enthusiast said.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251007-082128-301112d266-web-2.31.2-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images The peaks of Mount Everest covered in snow with a cloudy sky in the background\" /><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>The showstorm hit during Golden Week, a peak season for local tourism in China</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Another woman told the BBC that her husband who had been stuck in the snowstorm was slowly descending from the mountains, but thick snow cover has made his retreat extremely difficult. </p><p>\"Even for rescuers, it's not easy, they need to clear snow to make a path,\" said the woman, who declined to be named.</p><p>\"I hope my husband's team reaches [the rescue team] safely.\"</p><p>Her husband had told her that he barely slept in his tent because he was afraid of being buried in the snow, the woman said.</p><p>Another hiker, Eric Wen, told Reuters that three people in his group suffered from hypothermia even though they were adequately dressed.</p><p>They hardly slept because it was snowing too hard and his group had to clear the snow every 10 minutes. </p><p>\"Otherwise our tents would have collapsed.\"</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251007-082128-301112d266-web-2.31.2-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp\" alt=\"Dong Shuchang A hiker dressed in a winter coat and carrying a navy backpack trudges through thick snow cover\" /><span>Dong Shuchang</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Mr Dong's escape from the trail was lined with wet snow and falling sleet</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>China is in the middle of its week-long National Day holiday known as Golden Week, a peak season for local tourism.</p><p>October usually provides clear skies and friendly temperatures, making it one of the favoured months to hike in the Mount Everest area. </p><p>Many hikers have made their way to the Karma Valley hiking trail, a lesser-known but scenic route to the base of Everest - which also offers a view of the world's highest peak.</p><p>Although many people attempt to climb the summit every year, it is considered an incredibly dangerous hike. </p><p>In recent years it has been plagued with concerns of overcrowding, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cq5539lj1pqo\">environmental concerns</a> and a series of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-65680598\">fatal climbing attempts.</a></p><p>The region is facing extreme weather at the moment. </p><p>Neighbouring Nepal has been battered by torrential rains and floods that has killed at least 47 people, blocked roads, and washed away bridges.</p><p>On the other side of China, Typhoon Matmo has made landfall on the country's eastern coast, forcing about 150,000 people to evacuate from their homes. </p></div></article>",

For the third time in a year his choice of prime minister has resigned, and opinion polls suggest almost three-quarters of voters think the president should step down too.</p><p>Macron has repeatedly said he will not leave office early, and France is now waiting to find out if a new government can be formed, or if he has to dissolve parliament.</p></div><p></p><h2>How did we get here?</h2><p></p><div><p>Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu announced his resignation at the start of a day of political drama on Monday, after only 26 days in the job.</p><p>Hours later he said he had accepted Macron's request to stay on for another 48 hours - until the end of Wednesday - to hold last-ditch talks with political parties \"for the stability of the country\".</p><p>The unexpected twists were the latest in a long series of upheavals that began with Emmanuel Macron's decision to call a snap parliamentary election in June 2024. The result was a hung parliament in which Macron's centrist partners lost their majority and had to seek alliances with other parties.</p><p>The leader of one of those parties, Bruno Retailleau of the conservative Republicans, pulled out of Lecornu's government 14 hours after it was announced.</p></div><p></p><h2>It's all about France's debt</h2><p></p><div><p>The big challenge facing Lecornu and his two predecessors has been how to tackle France's crippling national debt and get over the ideological divisions between the centre-ground parties who could be part of a government.</p><p>Early this year public debt stood at €3.4tn (£2.9tn), or almost 114% of economic output (GDP), the third highest in the eurozone after Greece and Italy. France's budget deficit this year is projected to hit 5.4% of GDP.</p><p>Michel Barnier and François Bayrou lasted only three and nine months respectively before being ousted in confidence votes as they tried to tackle the deficit with austerity budgets.</p><p>Lecornu did not even make it as far as presenting a budget plan. Criticism poured in from all sides as soon as he presented his cabinet on Sunday afternoon and by Monday morning he had decided his position was untenable.</p><p>He blamed his departure on the unmovable stance of parties who, he said, \"all behave as if they had a majority\".</p><p>All the parties have an eye on the next presidential votes in 2027, and they are also gearing up for the possibility of snap parliamentary elections in case Macron dissolves parliament again.</p></div><p></p><h2>What happens now?</h2><p></p><div><p>Lecornu has been deep in discussions with party representatives and has until Wednesday evening to present a \"platform of action and stability\" to Macron.</p><p>There are four options - and none of them look good.</p></div><div><ul><li>If Lecornu manages to persuade the centre-ground parties to form some kind of government, then Macron will be able to name a new prime minister, whoever that is. Lecornu has indicated he does not wish to take on the job.  He said on Wednesday that there was a \"willingness\" among the parties to have a budget in place by 31 December and that this will clearly helped \"distance\" the threat of dissolving parliament. One option he has is to offer the job to the Socialists, if Macron is prepared to suspend hard-fought reforms that raised the pension age in France from 62 to 64. But that would cost France billions and the next government needs to pass some kind of 2026 budget to tackle its national debt, and bring down the budget deficit.</li><li>If Lecornu fails, the Elysee has indicated that Macron would \"take responsibility\". That would probably mean fresh parliamentary elections, which would spell bad news for his centrist allies and the Socialists but would benefit Marine Le Pen's hard-right National Rally in particular. Elections would need to take place a maximum of 40 days after parliament is dissolved - which would mean voting in November.</li><li>Macron's presidency ends in 18 months but he is facing increasing calls to step down. He has repeatedly rejected early presidential elections, but it is not out of the question. Former Macron minister Benjamin Haddad argues that his resignation would make no sense  as the next president would just face the same problem: \"The political divide is here to stay.\"</li><li>Even without a government agreement, the parties could put aside their differences in parliament and come to a compromise on a limited budget. But French politics is not known for its culture of compromise.</li></ul></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251007-082128-301112d266-web-2.31.2-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters A smiling Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella walk down the street\" /><span>Reuters</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>A snap election would benefit Marine Le Pen's hard-right National Rally in particular</figcaption><p></p></figure><p></p><h2>Who are the key figures in this crisis?</h2><p></p><div><p>The leaders who have been calling on Macron to resign for months are on the hard right and radical left.</p><p>Marine Le Pen and her young lieutenant in the far-right National Rally, Jordan Bardella, are ready for elections and have refused Lecornu's invitation to talk.</p><p>Jean-Luc Mélenchon of the radical left France Unbowed (LFI) has been agitating for Macron's impeachment, although that seems unlikely.

Gregersen, the founder of precious metals dealer and storage provider Silver Bullion, said he has seen customers numbers more than double in the last year.</p><p>Retail investors, banks and wealthy families have increasingly turned to gold, viewing it as a safeguard against global economic uncertainty, he said.</p><p>\"Gold will fall at some point, but I believe given the economic environment, it's on an upward trend for at least five years,\" Mr Gregersen said.</p><p>Gold may fall in value if there is a hike in interest rates or geopolitical tensions and political uncertainties ease, said OCBC's Mr Wong.</p><p>In April, for instance, the price of gold fell by around 6% after Trump backed off from firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he said.</p><p>\"Gold is often seen as a hedge against uncertainty, but the hedge can be unwound.\"</p><p>And in 2022, gold's<b> </b>value plunged from $2,000 to $1,600 an ounce, after the US central bank raised interest rates to curb the inflation triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, said UOB's Mr<b> </b>Heng.</p><p>A key risk to gold's current rally is a sudden resurgence in inflation, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise rates, he added.</p><p>The recent climb in gold prices reflects expectations that the Fed will lower interest rates, making gold more attractive, said Mr Wong.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump has ramped up pressure on the Fed, publicly criticising Mr Powell for not cutting rates quick enough and attempting to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook.</p><p>The president's targeting of the Fed can \"undermine confidence in the [its] ability to act as a credible, inflation-targeting central bank,\" said Mr Wong.</p><p>In such an environment, gold's role as a hedge against uncertainty \"gains renewed importance,\" he said.</p><p>The UK's central bank also raised concerns about the global tariff war and over the credibility of the Fed.</p></div><p></p><h2>AI warning</h2><p></p><div><p>While giving UK banks a broadly clean bill of health for resilience against potential shocks, the BoE's financial policy committee said the record concentration of stock markets on a handful of big tech companies was also a risk. </p><p>\"A sudden or significant change in perceptions of Federal Reserve credibility could result in a sharp re-pricing of US dollar assets, including in US sovereign debt markets, with the potential for increased volatility, risk premia, and global spillovers,\" the committee said.</p><p>The committee assesses all financial risks to the economy, and recommends whether banks should take steps to protect financial stability.</p><p>In its regular financial stability assessment, the committee identified the still soaring valuations of the world's biggest tech companies, especially those focused on AI in the US as a concern.</p><p>The committee said that on some profit measures, it was \"comparable to the peak of the dotcom bubble\", which ended in a huge crash at the turn of the millennium.</p><p>In its report, the committee said: \"On a number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on Artificial Intelligence

Each new tragedy exposes the rot in India's drug oversight system - a maze of weak enforcement and regulation. The Indian cough syrup market is set to soar from $262.5m in 2024 to $743m by 2035, growing at a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/india-cough-syrup-market-49731?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">compound annual rate of 9.9%</a>, according to Market Research Future.</p><p>But none of this would happen if India, and Indians, could wean themselves off their obsession with cough syrups. For decades, doctors have prescribed them, and patients have taken them, even though most do little good and can potentially do serious harm.</p><p>Marketed as quick relief for sore throats and stubborn coughs, these sweet syrups mix sugar, colour and flavouring with a cocktail of antihistamines, decongestants, expectorants.</p><p>In theory, each ingredient plays a role: one dries secretions, another loosens phlegm, a third dulls the cough reflex. In practice, evidence of them doing much good is small - most coughs get better on their own in a few days.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-63226055\">Cough syrup deaths: Why drugs made in India are sparking safety concerns</a></li></ul><p>A cough can result from either infection or an allergic reaction. Cough syrups broadly fall into two types - sedatives that help the child rest, and bronchodilators that ease breathing - and doctors usually prescribe one or the other, not a mix.</p><p>Most persistent coughs in children in increasingly polluted Indian cities are not caused by infection but by allergies and irritation of the lower airways, according to Dr Rajaram D Khare, a Mumbai-based pediatrician. Allergies occur when the immune system overreacts to triggers such as dust and pollution.</p><p>These children often have a cold or runny nose and a cough that worsens at night or early morning, recurring every few weeks. In big cities, he says, such recurrent, wet coughs are commonly triggered by dust and smog, sometimes accompanied by mild bronchospasm.</p><p>Dr Khare said such coughs respond best to bronchodilators - medicines that open up the airways  - preferably through inhalers or nebulisers, though many doctors still rely on syrups that offer only limited relief.</p><p>Most childhood coughs are viral, self-limiting, and resolve on their own within a week. Physicians say no syrup shortens their course; at best, they offer fleeting comfort. At worst, they carry risks of addiction, toxicity and overdose.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251007-082128-301112d266-web-2.31.2-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4e0e/live/486927c0-a344-11f0-b7cd-65ba7d624d13.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4e0e/live/486927c0-a344-11f0-b7cd-65ba7d624d13.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4e0e/live/486927c0-a344-11f0-b7cd-65ba7d624d13.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4e0e/live/486927c0-a344-11f0-b7cd-65ba7d624d13.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4e0e/live/486927c0-a344-11f0-b7cd-65ba7d624d13.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4e0e/live/486927c0-a344-11f0-b7cd-65ba7d624d13.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4e0e/live/486927c0-a344-11f0-b7cd-65ba7d624d13.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4e0e/live/486927c0-a344-11f0-b7cd-65ba7d624d13.jpg.webp\" alt=\"NurPhoto via Getty Images Cough syrups seized from different places being destroyed using road roller by Assam police to mark the Drug Destruction Day, in the outskirt of Guwahati in Assam, India on July 17, 2023.

If a child is coughing badly and can't sleep, I may give a dose of a mild syrup just to ease the discomfort. The main goal is relief, not treatment, especially when the cough is dry and part of a viral infection,\" says Dr Khare.</p><p>So why are cough syrups so widely prescribed in India?</p><p>One reason is the weakness of India's primary healthcare system, particularly in smaller towns and rural areas. As rising air pollution fuels persistent coughs, they are increasingly misused for routine respiratory infections.</p><p>The problem runs deeper in the countryside. In rural India, up to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Das%20et%20al.%202016.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">75% of primary care visits are handled by informal providers</a> - often self-taught \"RMPs\" or rural medical practitioners without formal medical training. </p><p>In places where the local public health clinic is far away, under-staffed, or shut, they are the de facto doctors - and syrups are their most trusted tools. When posted in Gorakhapur, a town in Uttar Pradesh, Dr Kafeel Khan, a pediatrician, remembers \"syrups being handed out everywhere - even by those with no degree\". </p><p>In many of these towns, patients rely on anyone who seems medically knowledgeable - from informal practitioners to shopkeepers - to manage even routine coughs. </p><p>\"Many poor patients turn to local chemists for advice, assuming the person behind the counter is a pharmacist; in 10 out of 10 times in rural India, that is a wrong assumption,\" says Dinesh Thakur, a former Indian drug executive-turned-public health expert.</p><p>\"While anecdotally, it appears that this problem is largely confined to small towns and rural India, there is some data that it is not. We see similar behaviour among people in big cities too. The only difference is the quality of drug supply in small towns and rural India is an order of magnitude worse compared to larger cities.\"</p><p>Another factor driving the trend is the combined pressure from anxious parents and gaps in medical knowledge.</p><p>\"Parents aren't always well-informed, and they can become impatient. If a child's cough or cold doesn't improve in a couple of days, they often consult another doctor who will give a cough syrup,\" says Dr Khan.</p><p>Low knowledge among doctors adds to the problem. Dr Khan says he has \"seen even MD pediatricians prescribe ambroxol cough syrup for children\". </p><p>\"It's meant to break up sputum, but kids under two can't spit it out, so the mucus can be aspirated into the lungs, causing pneumonia - yet it is still prescribed.\"</p><p>India needs a clear policy on cough syrups and nationwide awareness among doctors and parents to curb reckless use. The stakes are real: the Madhya Pradesh doctor who prescribed the syrup linked to recent child deaths <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/been-prescribing-this-cough-syrup-for-15-years-doctor-arrested-for-madhya-pradesh-childrens-deaths-10289896/lite/\">defended his practice,</a> saying, \"I've been prescribing this cough syrup for 15 years.\"</p></div></article>",

    "body": "Parts of Australia will face catastrophic fire conditions on Friday, when heatwaves are expected to hit most of the country.Severe to extreme heatwaves have been declared in every state and territory in Australia, except for Queensland, with high temperatures forecast for days.The state of Victoria has declared a total fire ban for Friday, as the fire danger rating will be set at \"catastrophic\" - the highest level. Some 450 schools and childcare centres will be closed.One meteorologist told the BBC that the combination of heatwaves and an elevated fire danger in parts of the country could create the most \"significant\" conditions since the devastating Black Summer bushfires.On Thursday, firefighters battled several blazes in Victoria and New South Wales (NSW), with a dozen planes carrying water called in to tackle a large fire near the city of Wodonga, the ABC reported.Melbourne experienced its hottest day in six years on Wednesday with a high of 40.9C (105.6F), while some coastal towns in Western Australia hit 49C.In NSW, the heatwave is expected to peak on Saturday with Sydney facing a high of 42C while areas of South Australia and Western Australia will see temperatures over 40C in the coming days. Friday will be the \"real peak of the current burst of heat,\" Angus Hines from the Bureau of Meteorology told the BBC.\"It will be a very hot day for almost all of South Australia, Victoria, most of New South Wales, parts of Tasmania\".Wednesday was the first significant heatwave for Melbourne and Adelaide, where millions of people live, with fire conditions set to worsen on Friday, he said.\"Firstly, the winds are strengthening across Victoria tomorrow,\" Hines said, adding that coupled with possible thunderstorms with little rain and dry lightning strikes, the fire danger will hit catastrophic levels for the northern parts of Victoria.\"This looks like the most significant event at a multi-day level for inland south-east Australia since 2019-2020,\" Hines said.That period six years ago saw Australia's most severe fire season on record, the so-called Black Summer where dozens of people died and tens of millions of hectares of land was burnt. In Victoria, authorities on Thursday warned that a catastrophic fire danger rating means potential blazes can be \"unpredictable and uncontrollable\".\"We need the community to play their role alongside our emergency services to protect lives and property,\" said Victoria's Emergency Management Commissioner Tim Wiebusch.\"Prepare now and enact your bushfire survival plan. If you are in an area of forecast catastrophic fire danger, leave early to an area with a lower fire risk.\"Australia's fire danger ratings scale has four levels, with catastrophic being the highest level, followed by extreme, high and moderate.A heatwave is declared when the minimum and maximum temperatures are expected to be unusually high for three days of more.",

    "body": "10 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent  , BeirutThe Lebanese army says it has taken over security in the south of the country, which for decades had been dominated by the Iranian-backed movement Hezbollah, amid fears that Israel could escalate its military offensive against the group.Lebanon has been under intense international pressure, particularly from the US, to disarm Hezbollah, a powerful militia and political party, since a ceasefire deal in November 2024 ended a devastating year-long war between Israel and Hezbollah.The army had set a year-end deadline to clear the area south of the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) from the border with Israel, of non-state weapons in the first phase of a government-backed plan.The army said its objective had been achieved in an \"effective and tangible way\" but that there was more work to be done to clear unexploded ordnance and tunnels.Responding to the Lebanese army's statement, the office of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said efforts toward fully disarming Hezbollah were \"an encouraging beginning, but they are far from sufficient, as evidenced by Hezbollah's efforts to rearm and rebuild its terror infrastructure with Iranian support\".In recent months, Lebanese soldiers have dismantled infrastructure in areas once controlled by Hezbollah in the south without facing resistance from the group, which says it has complied with the ceasefire deal and removed its fighters from those areas, where Palestinian factions including Hamas had also operated.But US and Israeli officials have expressed frustration with the pace of the army's efforts. Israel has accused Hezbollah - which is considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the US and the UK - of trying to recover its military capabilities, including in the south. In recent days, Israeli media reported that Netanyahu had been given a green light by US President Donald Trump to intensify its military campaign against Hezbollah.Despite the ceasefire, Israel has carried out near-daily attacks on targets it says are linked to Hezbollah and continues to occupy at least five positions in southern Lebanon. The Lebanese government rejects the Israeli claims, and says Israel's actions are a violation of the ceasefire deal and an obstacle to the army's efforts.Israel has not made the evidence it says it has about Hezbollah's activities public, and the UN peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, known as Unifil, says it has seen no indication that the group is rebuilding its infrastructure in the areas where it operates.Lebanese officials say the next stage of the army's plan will focus on the area between the Litani and the Awali rivers, which includes the port city of Sidon. There is no timeline for that, and the cash-strapped Lebanese army has also complained of insufficient funding and equipment.Meanwhile, it is unclear if Hezbollah will resist the measures in other areas as it says it will not disarm north of the Litani. The group also has a strong presence in the eastern Bekaa valley and in Beirut's southern suburbs, known as the Dahieh. Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun has rejected the use of force against the group, saying this could exacerbate sectarian divisions and lead to violence.Hezbollah - which is also a political party with representation in parliament and in the government, and a social movement that runs hospitals and schools - still enjoys significant support among Lebanon's Shia community. Opponents, however, see this as a unique opportunity to disarm the group, after its losses in the war. Hezbollah, so far, has rejected calls from the authorities to discuss the future of its weapons.In Lebanon's south, tens of thousands of residents remain displaced and communities lie in ruins, as Lebanon's international partners have conditioned funds for reconstruction on measures that include action against Hezbollah.",

    "body": "7 hours agoChris GrahamandRachel HaganMore than one million people in south-eastern Ukraine spent hours without heating and water supplies as a result of Russian air strikes, officials have said. The attacks damaged infrastructure across the south-eastern Dnipropetrovsk region - as well as in neighbouring Zaporizhzhia. Russia has recently intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, aimed at paralysing power supplies during a harsh winter. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky accused it of \"mockery\" and pleaded for Western support. He later said there were fears of \"a new massive Russian strike\" as Moscow was trying to take advantage of the weather, with heavy snow and frost expected across Ukraine. Hospitals, water facilities and other critical services in Dnipropetrovsk had to operate on backup systems, the energy ministry said, while residents were urged to limit electricity use to avoid further strain on the grid.DTEK, Ukraine's biggest private energy provider, is living in permanent crisis mode because of Russian attacks on the grid, its chief executive told the BBC last month, with most of Ukraine suffering from lengthy power cuts during winter.Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, which provides power for 5.6 million Ukrainians, said the intensity of strikes had been so frequent \"we just don't have time to recover\".As the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion approaches, Timchenko said Russia had repeatedly targeted DTEK's energy grid with \"waves of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles\" and his company had found it difficult to cope.\"There is no military sense in such strikes on the energy sector, on infrastructure,\" Zelensky said on Thursday. He urged Ukrainians to remain \"resilient\" against Russia's attempts \"to break Ukraine\" and added that peace talks aimed at ending the war should not be a reason to slow down Western supplies for Ukraine's air defences.Zelensky has been on a diplomatic tour this week - meeting allies in the \"Coalition of the Willing\" and US President Donald Trump's peace envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. Following those talks in Paris on Tuesday, the UK and France signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops in Ukraine if a peace deal is reached - a move Moscow warned would make foreign forces a \"legitimate target\".But a day later, Zelensky said European allies had not given him sound guarantees that they would protect his country in the event of new Russian aggression.However, he also said he believed Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine could be brought to an end in the first half of 2026. Speaking at the opening of Cyprus's presidency of the EU for the next six months, he said negotiations with European partners and the US had entered a new stage and stressed that the EU should play a central role in any settlement.President Donald Trump has been leading efforts to bring the war to an end. His proposals - amended by Ukraine and its European allies - envisage Ukrainian territorial concessions to Russia in areas it does not already control in the country's east.Negotiations centre on those points - the last 10% of the deal, according to Zelensky. So far, Ukraine has refused to agree to cede territory to Russia.Once agreed, those proposals would need Russia's approval.Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no sign of backing down for his demands to annex the entire territory of the industrial eastern region of Donbas.His troops have been making slow progress in the past few months.",

    "body": "Tournament chiefs admit errors over viral wildcard Image source, ITFImage caption, Hajar Abdelkader's biography on the ITF website says she started playing tennis at the age of 14ByStewart MacleanBBC News, in NairobiThe organisers of a professional women's tournament which has gone viral on social media because of a wildcard player's dire performance have acknowledged she should not have been allowed to play.Egyptian Hajar Abdelkader, 21, lost 6-0 6-0 and served 20 double faults during the first-round match in Nairobi on Wednesday, with the footage leaving many viewers wondering if she had ever played tennis before.The amateur player won only three points during her 37-minute debut - two double faults by opponent Lorena Schaedel and an unforced error from the bemused German, ranked 1,026th in the world.The match was part of an International Tennis Federation (ITF) W35 tournament, hosted by Tennis Kenya, the governing body for the sport in Kenya.Tennis Kenya said it had reached out to both Abdelkader and Schaedel to offer its support \"given the extent and nature of coverage of this match\". Tennis Kenya said Abdelkader had applied to enter the tournament as a wildcard and had been given a space at the last minute following the withdrawal of another player.The organisation said she was permitted to enter to maintain a balance of players and nations represented in the tournament, but said that in hindsight she should not have been allowed to play.\"The federation has taken note of this experience and will ensure that such an extremely rare occurrence never happens again,\" the organisation added. \"Tennis Kenya remains committed to fairness, transparency and the integrity of competition, as well as to the continued development of tennis in Kenya, East Africa, and across Africa.\" The Egyptian Tennis Federation confirmed to the BBC Abdelkader has never been registered as an Egyptian player and had not been entered into the tournament on Egypt's behalf.Egyptian Tennis Federation technical director Dia Nabil Loutfy said: \"We would like to clarify that she is not registered with the Egyptian Tennis Federation, nor is she included in any of our official player lists.\"Based on the information available to us, the player was previously residing in Kenya and participated in the ITF tournament in Nairobi through a wildcard granted by the Kenyan Tennis Federation.\"The Egyptian Tennis Federation had no role whatsoever, whether directly or indirectly, in the nomination, approval, or issuance of this wildcard, and we were not involved in the player's entry into the tournament in any capacity.\"The organisation said it had no records relating to Abdelkader, and said she had never been affiliated with the Egyptian Tennis Federation.",

    "body": "8 hours agoDavid GrittenReutersPolice patrol Aden, from where the Saudi-led coalition said Aidarous al-Zubaidi had fled by boatThe Saudi-led coalition in Yemen has alleged the United Arab Emirates helped smuggle a separatist leader out of the country after he was expelled from Yemen's presidential council and accused of treason.A coalition spokesman said Aidarous al-Zubaidi, head of the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC), fled Aden on Tuesday night in a boat to Somaliland. He was then flown by a cargo aircraft to Abu Dhabi via Mogadishu under the supervision of UAE officers, he added.There was no immediate comment from the UAE or STC.The STC insisted Zubaidi was still working from Aden on Wednesday, after the coalition said he had failed to fly to Riyadh for talks and had fled to an unknown location.The coalition also accused Zubaidi of moving STC forces from bases in Aden to his home province of al-Dahle and said it had carried out air strikes on them in response.The STC said the strikes, which reportedly killed four people, were \"unjustified\" and \"inconsistent\" with calls for dialogue with Yemen's internationally recognised government, which is overseen by the presidential council and backed by Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been allies in the war against Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi movement over the past decade, but the infighting between the rival factions they support has deepened a rift between them and pushed southern Yemen to the brink of a new conflict.On Thursday, coalition spokesman Maj Gen Turki al-Malki said it had \"reliable intelligence\" showing Zubaidi and his associates fled from Aden's port in the early hours of Wednesday on board a St Kitts and Nevis-flagged passenger ship.The vessel sailed across the Gulf of Aden to Berbera in the breakaway region of Somaliland, where a Ilyushin Il-76 cargo aircraft was waiting, he added.Malki said Zubaidi and his associates \"boarded the aircraft under the supervision of UAE officers\" and flew first to Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, before heading towards the Arabian Sea \"without a declared destination\".\"The aircraft disabled its identification systems over the Gulf of Oman, reactivating them only 10 minutes prior to landing at Al-Reef Military Air Base in Abu Dhabi,\" he added, without saying directly whether Zubaidi was still aboard.Somalia's immigration agency said it was investigating an \"alleged unauthorised use\" of its airspace and airports.ReutersThe Southern Transitional Council had said on Wednesday that Zubaidi was still in Aden (file photo)STC-aligned forces have in recent years taken control of much of southern Yemen, which they want once again to be an independent state, by pushing out forces loyal to the government.However, Saudi Arabia warned last week that the advances near the kingdom's borders constituted threats to its national security as well as the security and stability of Yemen.It also accused the UAE of \"pressuring\" its separatist allies to push into eastern Yemen and expressed support for a demand from the presidential council for all Emirati forces to leave.At the same time, the Saudi-led coalition - which was formed in 2015 by Arab states, including the UAE, after Houthi rebels seized control of north-western Yemen - struck what it said was a shipment of weapons and military vehicles for the STC that had arrived from the UAE.The UAE expressed \"deep regret\" at the Saudi accusations and denied there were any weapons, but agreed to pull its remaining forces out of the country.Since then, forces loyal to the government have retaken control of Hadramawt and al-Mahra with the help of coalition air strikes.Witnesses and government officials told Reuters news agency on Thursday that Aden was also now coming under the control of Saudi-backed forces.",

    "body": "18 minutes agoDavid GrittenWatch: Protests break out in Iran's capital city TehranHuge crowds of protesters have been marching through Iran's capital and other cities, videos show, in what is said to be the largest show of force by opponents of the clerical establishment in years.The peaceful demonstrations in Tehran and the second city of Mashhad on Thursday evening, which were not dispersed by security forces, can be seen in footage verified by BBC Persian.Later, a monitoring group reported a nationwide internet blackout.Protesters can be heard in the footage calling for the overthrow of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the return of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late former shah, who had urged his supporters to take to the streets.It was the 12th consecutive day of unrest that has been sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency and has spread to more than 100 cities and towns across all 31 of Iran's provinces, according to human rights groups.The US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA) has said at least 34 protesters - five of them children - and eight security personnel have been killed, and that 2,270 other protesters have been arrested.Norway-based monitor Iran Human Rights (IHR) has said at least 45 protesters, including eight children, have been killed by security forces.BBC Persian has confirmed the deaths and identities of 22 people, while Iranian authorities have reported the deaths of six security personnel.On Thursday evening, videos posted on social media and verified by BBC Persian showed a large crowd of protesters moving along a major road in Mashhad, in the country's north-east.Chants of \"Long live the shah\" and \"This is the final battle! Pahlavi will return\" can be heard. And at one point, several men are seen climbing on an overpass and removing what appears to be surveillance cameras attached to it.Another video posted online showed a large crowd of protesters walking along a major road in eastern Tehran. In footage sent to BBC Persian from the north of the capital, another large crowd is heard chanting \"This is the final battle! Pahlavi will return\". Elsewhere in the north, protesters were filmed shouting \"Dishonourable\" and \"Don't be afraid, we are all together\" following a clash with security forces. Other videos showed protesters chanting \"Death to the dictator\" - a reference to Khamenei - in the central city of Isfahan; \"Long live the shah\" in the northern city of Babol, and \"Don't be afraid, we are all together\" in the north-western city of Tabriz.In the western city of Dezful, footage sent to BBC Persian showed a large crowd of protesters and also security personnel appearing to open fire from a central square. The evening protests came not long after Reza Pahlavi, whose father was overthrown by the 1979 Islamic revolution and lives in Washington DC, had called on Iranians to \"take to the streets and, as a united front, shout your demands\".In a post on X, Pahlavi said \"millions of Iranians demanded their freedom tonight\", describing the protesters as his \"courageous compatriots\".He thanked US President Donald Trump for holding the \"regime to account\", and called on European leaders to do the same.Pahlavi has also called for protests to continue from 20:00 local time (16:30 GMT) on Friday night.Iranian state media downplayed the scale of Thursday's unrest. In some cases, they denied protests had taken place altogether, posting videos of empty streets.Meanwhile, internet watchdog NetBlocks said its metrics showed that Iran was \"in the midst of a nationwide internet blackout\".\"The incident follows a series of escalating digital censorship measures targeting protests across the country and hinders the public's right to communicate at a critical moment,\" it warned, referring to previous losses of connectivity in several cities.Earlier in the day, footage from Lomar, a small town in the western province of Ilam, showed a crowd chanting \"Cannons, tanks, fireworks, mullahs must go\" - a reference to the clerical establishment. Another showed people throwing papers into the air outside a bank that appeared to have been broken into.Other videos showed many shuttered shops in a number of predominantly Kurdish cities and towns in Ilam, as well as Kermanshah and Lorestan provinces.It followed a call for a general strike by exiled Kurdish opposition groups in response to the deadly crackdown on protests in the region.At least 17 protesters have been killed by security forces in Ilam, Kermanshah and Lorestan during the unrest, and many of them have been members of the Kurdish or Lor ethnic minorities, according to Kurdish human rights group Hengaw.On Wednesday, there were violent clashes between protesters and security forces in several cities and towns in western Iran, as well as other regions.IHR said it had been the deadliest day of the unrest, with 13 protesters confirmed to have been killed across the country.\"The evidence shows that the scope of crackdown is becoming more violent and more extensive every day,\" said the group's director, Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam.Hengaw said two protesters were shot dead by security forces in Khoshk-e Bijar, in the northern province of Gilan, on Wednesday night.Iran's semi-official news agency Fars, which is close to the Revolutionary Guards, reported that three police officers were also killed on Wednesday. It said two were shot dead by armed individuals among a group of \"rioters\" in the south-western town of Lordegan, and the third was stabbed to death \"during efforts to control unrest\" in Malard country, west of Tehran.XIn videos from Mashhad, protesters can be heard chanting \"Long live the shah\"On Thursday, US President Donald Trump reiterated his threat to intervene militarily if Iranian authorities killed protesters.\"I have let them know that if they start killing people, which they tend to do during their riots - they have lots of riots - if they do it, we are going to hit them very hard,\" he said in an interview with the Hugh Hewitt Show.Separately, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said the Iranian economy was \"on the ropes\".While speaking at the Economic Club of Minnesota on Thursday, he added: \"[President Trump] does not want them to harm more of the protesters. This is a tense moment.\" Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian earlier called on security forces to exercise \"utmost restraint\" when handling peaceful protests. \"Any violent or coercive behaviour should be avoided,\" a statement said.Khamenei - who has ultimate power in Iran - said on Saturday that authorities should \"speak with the protesters\" but that \"rioters should be put in their place\".The protests began on 28 December, when shopkeepers took to the streets of Tehran to express their anger at another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market.The rial has sunk to a record low over the past year and inflation has soared to 40% as sanctions over Iran's nuclear programme squeeze an economy also weakened by government mismanagement and corruption.University students soon joined the protests and they began spreading to other cities, with crowds frequently heard chanting slogans critical of the clerical establishment.In messages sent to the BBC, via a UK-based activist, a woman in Tehran said despair was driving the protests.\"We're living in limbo,\" she said. \"I feel like I'm hanging in the air with neither wings to migrate nor hope to pursue my goals here. Life here has become unbearable.\"Another said she was protesting because her dreams had been \"stolen\" by the clerical establishment and she wanted it to know that \"we still have a voice to shout, a fist to punch them in the face.\"A woman in the western city of Ilam said she knew of young people from families affiliated with the establishment who were taking part in protests. \"My friend and her three sisters, whose father is a well-known figure in the intelligence services, are joining without their father knowing,\" she said.The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. More than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained by security forces over several months, according to human rights groups.The biggest protests since the Islamic revolution took place in 2009, when millions of Iranians took to the streets of major cities after a disputed presidential election. Dozens of opposition supporters killed and thousands were detained in the ensuing crackdown.",

    "body": "9 hours agoTiffany WertheimerRenee Nicole GoodRenee Nicole Good was an award-winning poetThe woman shot dead by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis has been identified as Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three who had just moved to the city.She was a prize-winning poet and a hobby guitarist, who city leaders have said was there as a legal observer of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities.But the Trump administration has called her a \"domestic terrorist\".Good's death has sparked protests across the country, with many people holding signs that read \"Justice for Renee\".Her mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was \"probably terrified\" during the confrontation with officers that saw her fatally shot and that she was \"one of the kindest people I've ever known\".\"She was extremely compassionate,\" Ganger told the daily newspaper. \"She's taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.\"Her father, Tim Ganger, told the Washington Post that \"she had a good life, but a hard life\".A fundraiser for Good's family, which was set up with a target of $50,000 (£37,000), raised more than $500,000 in 15 hours.In what appears to be Good's Instagram account, which has now been made private, Good described herself as a \"poet and writer and wife and mom\", who was \"experiencing Minneapolis\".A US citizen, Good was originally from Colorado Springs and had moved to Minneapolis just last year from Kansas City.The Minnesota Star Tribune reports that she used to host a podcast with her second husband, Tim Macklin, who died in 2023. They had a son together, who is now six years old, Macklin's father told the newspaper. She had two other children with her first husband, who spoke to US media on condition that his name was not used. He said that Good was not an activist and that she was a devoted Christian who went to Northern Ireland on youth missions when she was younger.She had previously worked as a dental assistant and at a credit union, but had mainly been a stay-at-home mum in recent years, according to the Associated Press.Getty ImagesPeople have left flowers, candles and messages at a make-shift memorial for Good in MinneapolisGood studied creative writing at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, and in 2020 she won an undergraduate prize from the Academy of American Poets for her piece entitled On Learning to Dissect Fetal Pigs.\"When she is not writing, reading, or talking about writing, she has movie marathons and makes messy art with her daughter and two sons,\" her biography from the prize reads, as quoted in US media. It seems to have now been removed.Good graduated the same year from the university's College of Arts and Letters with a degree in English.Its president said in a statement that her sudden death was \"yet another clear example that fear and violence have sadly become commonplace in our nation\".\"May Renee's life be a reminder of what unites us: freedom, love, and peace,\" Old Dominion University president Brian Hemphill wrote.Several state leaders have said that Good was at the scene of an ICE raid in the south of Minneapolis as a legal observer - a volunteer who monitors police and security forces at protests and operations. Good's mother told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was \"not part of anything\" that involved challenging ICE agents.But White House officials, including the president, have said Good was not simply observing, but also interfering in the officers' work.US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Good had been \"stalking and impeding their work\" all day by \"blocking them in\" with her car and \"shouting at them\".Good \"weaponised her vehicle\", Noem told reporters, and then tried to run over one of the officers \"in an attempt to kill or cause bodily harm to agents, an act of domestic terrorism\".The ICE agent feared for his life, Noem said, and \"fired defensive shots\".This account was backed up by Trump, who wrote on Truth Social that \"the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting\".He called her a \"professional agitator\" who \"violently, willfully, and viciously\" ran over an ICE officer.But the city's mayor said the agent who shot Good had acted recklessly.\"Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: that is bullshit,\" Jacob Frey said. \"This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.\"Good reportedly lived just a few blocks from where she was killed, and the scene is about one mile from where George Floyd was murdered in 2020 by a city police officer, sparking worldwide anti-racism protests.",

    "description": "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced a royal commission, the country's most powerful form of independent inquiry, into last month'",
    "body": "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced a royal commission, the country's most powerful form of independent inquiry, into last month's shooting at Bondi Beach. The attack targeting a Jewish festival left 15 people dead, making it one of the deadliest in the country's history.Albanese had previously argued that reforms on gun ownership and hate speech, steps to tackle antisemitism and a review into intelligence and law enforcement agencies offered the quickest response.But following weeks of public pressure, he said on Thursday that a royal commission was the best way forward after he had taken \"the time to reflect\" and meet with the Jewish community.\"I've repeatedly said that our government's priority is to promote unity and social cohesion, and this is what Australia needs to heal, to learn, to come together in a spirit of national unity,\" he told reporters in Canberra. \"It's clear to me that a royal commission is essential to achieving this.\"Since the 14 December attack, the families of the victims, as well as a chorus of public figures, including lawyers, business people and athletes had led an almost daily campaign calling for him to reverse course and launch a royal commission.A royal commission has broad powers to investigate, the ability to summon witnesses and compel agencies to produce documents. It can also offer legal protections to whistleblowers.The commission will examine four key areas, Albanese said. They comprise:investigating the \"nature and prevalence of antisemitism\" and its \"key drivers\" in Australiamaking recommendations to enforcement, border immigration and security agencies to tackle antisemitism examining the circumstances surrounding the Bondi attackmaking any other recommendations for strengthening social cohesion and countering the spread of ideological and religiously motivated extremismThe prime minister said the work of Dennis Richardson, the former spy chief leading a review into intelligence and law enforcement agencies, would be wrapped into the royal commission, with an interim report expected in April.Former High Court justice Virginia Bell has been appointed to lead the commission, Albanese said, adding that he had asked her to report by December 2026 and that \"this won't be a drawn-out process.\" Previous royal commissions have taken years.\"This royal commission is the right format, the right duration and the right terms of reference to deliver the right outcome for our national unity and our national security,\" Albanese said.Rumours that Bell was to be appointed had earlier drawn criticism from the Jewish community. Former treasurer Josh Frydenberg said prior to Albanese's announcement the prime minister had been told by Jewish leaders there were \"serious concerns\" about her appointment, without specifying what they were.Speaking alongside Albanese, Attorney General Michelle Rowland said Bell was \"an eminent and highly capable former Justice of the High Court of Australia, and I have no doubt that she will examine the complex issues ahead with impartiality and precision\".Addressing concerns that a royal commission could interfere with the criminal legal proceedings against the alleged gunman who survived, Albanese added: \"It's one of the reasons why we chose someone who has a criminal law background, has been in senior positions in the Supreme Court and the High Court of Australia. That is, she's the most qualified person we could possibly consider.\"He also added that the inquiry was not meant to \"provide a solution on Gaza or on the Middle East\".\"The truth is that some people have held Jewish Australians to account for views or actions that that they're opposed to, that have nothing to do with them,\" Albanese said.In the days after the attack, state and federal leaders agreed to tighten gun controls, including limits on the number of firearms held by any one individual and on the types of firearms that can be held, as well as a buyback scheme.Albanese also promised hate speech reform including penalties for preachers and leaders who promote violence and a new federal offence of \"aggravated hate speech\".He previously said his government would adopt the recommendations put forward by antisemitism commissioner Jillian Segal in a July report.Her report was criticised by some upon its release due to its implications for free speech, such as plans to monitor universities and arts organisations and withhold funding if they were deemed to have failed to act against antisemitism.Speaking alongside the prime minister on Thursday, Segal said the government's decision was \"the right one and an important one\". \"It does reflect the seriousness of the growth in antisemitism and its impact on our country and our democracy,\" she said.",

    "body": "The US has suspended all assistance to the government of Somalia, alleging that officials destroyed a UN World Food Programme (WFP) warehouse and seized \"donor-funded food aid\".\"The Trump administration has a zero-tolerance policy for waste, theft, and diversion of life-saving assistance,\" said a US state department statement on X.The message, posted on the account of the under secretary for foreign assistance, said reports had been received about officials illegally seizing 76 tonnes of food intended for \"vulnerable Somalis\".Somali has denied the allegations, saying that the expansion work under way in the Mogadishu port, where the warehouse is located, had not affected any aid storage.It stressed that all the humanitarian aid in question was still \"under the custody and control of the World Food Programme including assistance provided by the United States\".A WFP staff member in Mogadishu, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed to the AFP news agency that the food aid had not been stolen.\"The warehouse was partially demolished during the weekend without the knowledge of the WFP team, but there was no looting involved,\" they said.The US said it would only resume assistance if the Somali government took \"accountability for its unacceptable actions and... appropriate remedial steps\".Although the US has withdrawn from several UN organisations under President Donald Trump, it remains by far the largest contributor to the WFP, paying $2bn (£1.5bn) in 2025 - almost a third of its total funding.Somalia's government is battling al-Qaeda-linked Islamist militants as it tries to rebuild the country after a devastating civil war and years of drought.This is the latest example of the deteriorating relations between Washington and Mogadishu.Last month, Trump lashed out at Somali migrants living in the US, telling reporters they should \"go back to where they came from\" and \"their country is no good for a reason\".Communities have been targeted in immigration raids as the government alleges large-scale benefit fraud in Minnesota, the US state with the largest Somali community in the US.The recent recognition by US ally Israel of the breakaway republic of Somaliland, which Somalia considers to be part of its territory, has further angered Mogadishu.The aid that was allegedly seized by Somali officials was meant to help people cope with the effects of \"drought, floods, conflict, high food prices and dwindling harvests\", according to the WFP.It quotes figures saying that 4.6 million people in Somalia are facing crisis levels of hunger.",

    "body": "9 hours agoDanny Aeberhard,Rachel HaganandMatt McGrath,environment correspondentUS President Donald Trump has withdrawn the US from dozens of international organisations, including many that work to combat climate change.Nearly half of the 66 affected bodies are UN-related, including the Framework Convention on Climate Change - a treaty that underpins all international efforts to combat global warming.Groups working on development, gender equality and conflict - areas the Trump administration had repeatedly dismissed as advancing \"globalist\" or \"woke\" agendas  - are also included. The White House said the decision was taken because those entities \"no longer serve American interests\" and promote \"ineffective or hostile agendas\".The memorandum was signed on Wednesday following a review, with the White House describing the organisations as \"a waste of taxpayer dollars\".\"These withdrawals will end American taxpayer funding and involvement in entities that advance globalist agendas over US priorities,\" it said in a statement.It added that many of the organisations promoted \"radical climate policies, global governance and ideological programs that conflict with US sovereignty and economic strength\".As well as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the US has also withdrawn from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the world's leading authority on climate science that pulls together the most respected reports on the science of rising global temperatures.Sources within the organisation told the BBC that they were concerned about the potential impact of the Trump administration's withdrawal on US scientists involved in producing the body's next set of studies.The White House has already blocked US scientists attending a meeting in China.Any restrictions on travel or the participation of US researchers could significantly delay the release of the next set of IPCC reports, including potentially its mitigation report - a key document guiding governments on how to tackle climate change.Non-UN organisations affected by the US withdrawal include those focused on clean energy co-operation, democratic governance and international security, such as the International Solar Alliance, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance and the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum. Trump has already stripped many multilateral organisations he dislikes of funds and previously rejected the scientific consensus of man-made climate change as a \"hoax\".It will take a year for the US to be able to fully withdraw from the UNFCCC - but in reality the US ceased effective participation in the UN's climate change body long ago.It remains unclear whether the move will be challenged in the US courts, as many campaigners are now urging.While the US constitution allows presidents to join treaties \"provided two thirds of Senators present concur\", it does not specify what happens if they were to withdraw. As such, it is uncertain a future president could reverse Trump's decision and opt back in simply by applying.These latest withdrawals come after the president  took the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement for a second time last year, and declined to send a delegation to the COP30 climate summit in Brazil. The US has also already withdrawn from the World Health Organization, the UN Human Rights Council and the UN's cultural agency, Unesco.European leaders have criticised this latest decision, warning it would weaken global co-operation. EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said the UNFCCC \"underpins global climate action\" and called the US retreat \"regrettable and unfortunate\", while the EU's clean transition vice-president Teresa Ribera said the administration showed little concern for the environment, health or human suffering.A member of a US-based non-profit advocacy group, the Union of Concerned Scientists, described the step as a \"new low\".Senior policy director Rachel Cleetus told news agency AFP that it was another sign the administration, which she described as \"authoritarian\" and \"anti- science\", was determined to sacrifice people's wellbeing and destabilise global co-operation.",

    "body": "US Vice-President JD Vance says Greenland is \"critical\" for the defence of the US and the world against possible Russian or Chinese missile attacks - and that Europe and Denmark have \"not done a good job\" in securing the area.Vance told Fox News that they had not only under-invested in Greenland's defences, but also failed to engage with President Donald Trump's argument over the issue.US officials are \"actively\" discussing a potential offer to buy Greenland - a semi-autonomous Danish territory - the White House said on Wednesday, a day after suggesting military action to annex it to the US was also an option.Denmark, a fellow Nato member, has warned this would spell the end of the alliance.Both Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly stressed the island is not for sale.Despite being the most sparsely populated territory, Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks, and for monitoring vessels in the region.The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland's north-western tip - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two.Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.In recent years, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources - including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron - which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. Scientists think it could also have significant oil and gas reserves.\"People do not realise that the entire missile defence infrastructure is partially dependent on Greenland,\" Vance said in his interview on Wednesday.\"If God forbid the Russians and the Chinese - not saying they're going to - but if, God forbid, somebody launched a nuclear missile into our continent, they launched a nuclear missile at Europe, Greenland is a critical part of that missile defence. \"So you ask yourself, 'have the Europeans, have the Danes done a proper job of securing Greenland and of making sure it can continue to serve as an anchor for world security and missile defence?' And the answer is obviously they haven't,\" he said. Concerns over the future of the territory resurfaced after Trump's use of military force against Venezuela on Saturday to seize its President Nicolás Maduro. Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, during his first presidential term, only to be told it was not for sale.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that he would hold talks with Denmark next week.A day earlier, European leaders issued a joint statement rallying behind Denmark.\"Greenland belongs to its people, and only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations,\" the leaders of France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark said in a joint statement.Stressing they were as keen as the US on Arctic security, the European signatories said this must be achieved by Nato allies, including the US, \"collectively\".They also called for \"upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders\".Aaja Chemnitz, one of two MPs in the Danish parliament representing Greenland, told the BBC that the comments from the Trump administration were \"a clear threat\".\"It's completely disrespectful from the US side to not rule out annexing our country and to annex another Nato ally,\" she said.But Chemnitz said she saw this as unlikely and that instead, \"what we are going to see is that they will put pressure on us in order to make sure that they will take over Greenland over time\".Aleqatsiaq Peary, a 42-year-old Inuit hunter living in Greenland's remote northerly town of Qaanaaq, appeared indifferent to the potential of US ownership.\"It would be switching from one master to another, from one occupier to another,\" he told the BBC. \"We are a colony under Denmark. We are already losing a lot from being under the Danish government.\"Saying that he did not have \"time for Trump\", he added that people were \"in need\". Hunters like him, he explained, hunted with dogs on the sea ice and fish \"but the sea ice is melting and hunters cannot make a living anymore\".Additional reporting by Adrienne Murray in Copenhagen",

    "body": "10 hours agoGuy HedgecoeMadridEPAThe deal is expected to expand the number of victims who can seek compensationSpain's Roman Catholic Church has reached an agreement with the government to compensate victims of sexual abuse by members of the clergy.The accord follows complaints that religious leaders had failed to tackle the issue adequately.It means the government will manage possible compensation in co-ordination with the Church, handling cases where other legal avenues are no longer available because the alleged crime took place too long ago or the individual accused has passed away.Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards are estimated by the government to have suffered sexual abuse at the hands of Church figures. The move follows similar redress schemes in other nations where abuse has been uncovered.\"A democracy should not allow the existence of victims who have never been compensated [and] whose situation, on the contrary, had been covered up,\" said Justice Minister Félix Bolaños after signing the agreement.He added that the agreement sought to \"pay off an historic, moral debt that we had with victims of abuse within the Church\".The other signatories were Luis Argüello, president of the Episcopal Conference and leader of the Spanish Catholic Church, and Jesús Díaz Sariego, president of Confer, which represents Catholic congregations and religious orders.Mr Sariego said the initiative was unprecedented as it tackled crimes that had gone past the statute of limitations.Argüello, who is archbishop of Valladolid, described the accord as \"another step forward along the path that for years we have been travelling\".A 2023 study by the Spanish ombudsman's office, which investigates public complaints, estimated that 1.1% of the population had suffered sexual abuse at the hands of members of the clergy or individuals linked to the Church - the equivalent of 440,000 people.The Church has contested these findings. It set up a reparation scheme that year to manage abuse claims. However, both the Socialist-led government and victims' organisations have been dissatisfied with the scheme's model, which did not allow input or oversight from outside the Church.In November, the Church said that 58 cases had been \"resolved\" under its framework. However, critics accused the institution of a lack of transparency and slowness. Newspaper El País, which has created a database of clerical abuse allegations, has documented cases affecting 2,948 victims dating back as far as the 1940s.Last June, several victims' groups broke off ties with the Spanish Church, alleging that it had excluded them from seeking reparations. The Vatican subsequently appeared to take a more prominent role, with the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors meeting Spanish victims and urging the country's Catholic leaders to bolster and facilitate reparations. Meetings between Justice Minister Bolaños and the Vatican's Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, appear to have raised the pressure further on the Church authorities in Madrid.EPAPope Francis apologised many times about the scandal that shook the Catholic ChurchUnder the new system, victims will be able to file their cases before a new agency created by the justice ministry, which will then take them before the ombusdman's office, which will draw up a reparation proposal. The Church must then agree to the proposed compensation – if not, the case will be referred back to the ombudsman.Reparation can be symbolic, psychological, or economic, according to the agreement. In each case, the Church is responsible for its execution.The amount of financial compensation that could be paid out is not specified.However, the ombudsman has suggested following the lead of other European countries.In Belgium, an average of €6,000 ($7,000; £5,210) has been paid to victims in such cases, although the late Pope Francis described that amount as \"too small\".Ireland's redress board paid out an average of around €63,000 to victims.Sexual abuse by members of the clergy first received significant attention in the US and Canada in the 1980s.In the 1990s, the issue began to grow, with stories emerging in Argentina, Australia and revelations of widespread historical abuse in Ireland. By the early 2000s, sexual abuse within the Church was a major global story.Spain, a Catholic country, was affected by relatively few scandals in that time. However, investigations by the media have brought the issue to light more recently. In the most recent high-profile case, the bishop of Cádiz, Rafael Zornoza, resigned in November, following an accusation of abuse dating back to the 1990s.Victims' organisations have welcomed the new agreement in Spain.\"This is an endemic, structural evil which has been within the Church and which it should have tackled a long time ago instead of covering up paedophiles,\" said Juan Cuatrecasas, of the Association for Stolen Childhood (Anir), who said he was \"fully satisfied\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoMadeline HalpertMinneapolisEloise Alanna/BBCFlowers have been left at the scene of the shooting in tribute to Renee GoodMinnesota officials say the FBI has blocked their access to an investigation into the fatal shooting of a woman by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent.People have taken to the streets of Minneapolis to protest the killing of 37-year-old Renee Good, who died on Wednesday after being shot in her car.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has accused the Trump administration of blocking state officials from involvement in the case, but the US vice-president said the investigation is a federal issue.Officials have offered differing accounts of the incident, with the Trump administration claiming the ICE agent was acting in self defence, while local officials say the woman posed no danger.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has claimed the ICE agent shot Good multiple times because she was trying to run over the officer in her car. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation said it would investigate the incident. Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) said the FBI had initially agreed to a joint investigation with state officials but then reversed course and denied the state access to materials and evidence. Without the ability to access all the necessary case materials and evidence, the BCA has \"reluctantly withdrawn\" from the investigation, the BCA's superintendent Drew Evans said in a statement.Watch: Politicians divided on Minneapolis shootingSpeaking at a news conference on Thursday, Walz said he was worried the federal government would not be able to carry out an unbiased investigation. \"It feels now that Minnesota has been taken out of the investigation,\" Walz said. \"It feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome.\"Vice President JD Vance told reporters on Thursday that the investigation into the shooting was a federal issue, arguing it would go against precedent for a local official to be involved in prosecuting the case. Videos of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car which is in the middle of the street, and tell the woman behind the wheel to get out of the SUV. One of the agents tugs at the driver's side door handle.As the vehicle attempts to drive off, one of the agents points their gun at the driver and several shots are heard.The car then continues to drive away from the officer and crashes into the side of the street. At the scene of the crash on Thursday, blood from the shooting could still be seen in the snow. People set up a vigil at the site to honour Good, lining the bank with candles and roses. Hundreds of demonstrators showed up throughout the day, shouting insults at ICE and offering their neighbours coffee on the cold winter day. Susie Hawyard, a minister, said she went to the scene of the shooting as soon as she heard the news to verify \"with my own eyes\" what happened. Eloise Alanna/BBCMembers of the community have been gathering to pay their respects to Good\"I was horrified,\" she said. \"I saw the car, I saw Renee's car, I saw Renee's blood.\" Protesters also gathered at a federal building in Minneapolis early Thursday morning, where they were met with armed officers. The protests remained largely peaceful there, as residents expressed their anger over the killing of Good. \"They cannot get away with killing someone. There has to be consequences for actions,\" said Gavin, one of dozens of people outside the federal building. Those who knew Good said she was a poet and guitarist who had just moved to the city of Minneapolis. Her mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was \"probably terrified\" during the confrontation with officers that saw her fatally shot. \"She was extremely compassionate,\" Ganger told the daily newspaper. \"She's taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.\"Even those who did not know Good said they were touched by her death. \"Renee was everything that was good about our community,\" said Nimco Ahmad, a Somali immigrant who grew up just blocks from the incident. Ahmad said she and others were gathered to help ensure justice would be secured for Good.Eloise Alanna/BBCNimco Ahmad said the shooting has shaken up the welcoming community of MinneapolisThe exclusion of state authorities from the probe into Good's killing is likely to undermine public trust, said Edward Maguire, a criminology professor at Arizona State University. \"From a criminological perspective, jurisdictional claims in cases like this are often less about legal requirements and more about political efforts to control the investigation and shape its outcome,\" he said. But the state could still file criminal charges later against the federal officer who killed Good, said Bryna Godar, a staff attorney with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School.With additional reporting from Grace Goodwin",

    "body": "8 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterLatin America online editorEPA/ShutterstockUS President Donald Trump has said that his country's involvement in Venezuela could last for years.He told the New York Times that \"only time will tell\" how long his administration would \"oversee\" the running of the South American nation following the seizure by US forces of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in a raid on Saturday. Trump also did not say if or when elections would be held in Venezuela to replace the interim government headed by Maduro loyalist Delcy Rodríguez.Meanwhile, Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado said the ouster of Maduro had set off an \"irreversible process\" that would lead Venezuela to be \"free\".New York Times (NYT) journalists quizzed Trump on his plans for the future of Venezuela days after he had said his administration would run the oil-rich nation.Earlier on Wednesday, the White House had said that the US would control sales of sanctioned oil \"indefinitely\".US Energy Secretary Chris Wright argued that the US needed control over Venezuela's oil sales for leverage over the interim government in Caracas. Trump said his administration would be \"taking oil\" from Venezuela, which has the world's largest proven reserves, but acknowledged it would \"take a while\" to get the country's oil industry up and running.Venezuela's oil production has plummeted as a result of mismanagement on the part of the Maduro government and that of his predecessor, as well as years of US sanctions.Watch: BBC Verify examines claims Venezuela \"stole\" US oilTrump told the NYT that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was \"in constant communication\" with Rodríguez, who was designated as Venezuela's interim leader by the country's Supreme Court, which is dominated by Maduro loyalists. He added that Rodríguez is \"giving us everything that we feel is necessary.\"The US president had earlier said that the interim government had agreed to use the proceeds from the sale of its oil to buy only US-made goods.According to the NYT reporters, Trump did not answer their questions about why he recognised Rodríguez as Venezuela's new leader.Many Venezuela analysts had expected that the ouster of Maduro would be followed swiftly by the return to the country of opposition leaders Edmundo González and María Corina Machado.But in his first news conference following the US raid, Trump was dismissive about  Machado, alleging that she lacked the \"respect\" and support to lead Venezuela. \"I think it would be very tough for her to be the leader,\" he said. Machado managed to unite opposition groups behind her ahead of the 2024 presidential election but was barred from running for the presidency by officials loyal to the Maduro government.She then threw her weight behind former diplomat González, who acted as her proxy.The electoral council, which is also dominated by government loyalists, declared Maduro re-elected. However, voting tallies collected by the opposition, which have been independently verified, suggest González won by a landslide. González went into exile to escape the government repression that followed the election, and Machado went into hiding within Venezuela.She embarked on a perilous journey by land, sea and air to reach Oslo in December to collect the Nobel Peace Prize she was awarded for her \"tireless work promoting democratic rights\" in Venezuela.Her current whereabouts are unknown but she has said that she plans to return to Venezuela soon.In an interview with Venezuelan opposition news site La Patilla, she insisted that the ousting of Maduro had set her country on an irreversible path towards freedom. She said that she hoped this new phase of the transition process would be \"as short and swift as possible\".She added that the interim government, which she said was \"the same regime it was under Maduro\" was \"being given instructions to dismantle itself\".Machado insisted that González was the legitimate president-elect and urged that his mandate be respected. She stressed that \"the first thing\" that needed to happen was for the political prisoners to be released. Machado is not the only one who has been demanding that the more than 800 political prisoners held in Venezuela's notorious jails be freed.On Wednesday, Republican lawmaker María Elvira Salazar published several posts on social media insisting they be released \"immediately\".However, in his interview with the NYT, Trump instead \"appeared far more focused on the rescue mission than the details of how to navigate Venezuela's future\", according to the journalists who spoke to him. Pressed on what the US plans for Venezuela are, he said that \"we will rebuild it in a very profitable way\".He added: \"We're going to be using oil, and we're going to be taking oil. We're getting oil prices down, and we're going to be giving money to Venezuela, which they desperately need.\"The US president is expected to meet representatives of three of the largest US oil companies at the White House on Friday to discuss those plans further.Meanwhile, the US Senate on Thursday voted 52-47 to take up a resolution intended to block the Trump administration from conducting further military action in Venezuela. The vote clears the way for debate on the resolution invoking the War Powers Act, but another vote would be needed for the final passage.It marks the first time during the second Trump administration that the Senate has voted to curb the president's use of military power.But it remains largely symbolic as it is not clear whether it will also clear the House, and if it does the president can still use his veto power to block it.",

The alert reached people nearly 200 miles away in the San Francisco Bay Area, triggering automatic warnings advising residents to drop for cover.However, the agency then cancelled the alert minutes later and removed the corresponding entry from its website.\"There was no M5.9 earthquake near Carson City, NV,\" the USGS said on X.The USGS said the alert originated from its automatic earthquake detection system, which had erroneously generated the report. It said it was believed to be the first time the agency has issued a completely false earthquake notification.An investigation is under way to determine what caused the malfunction.Multiple law enforcement agencies in cities and counties near the reported epicentre confirmed the absence of any ground movement.A magnitude 5.9 earthquake is typically strong enough to cause noticeable shaking and slight property damage, according to the Michigan Tech Earthquake Magnitude Scale.",

Officer Martin said the animal had fallen through one of the ceiling tiles before going \"on a full-blown rampage, drinking everything\". Only one blurry CCTV image of the boozy break-in exists, so it's unknown just how much alcohol the thirsty creature consumed before passing out in the bathroom.In a social media post, the store thanked Hanover County Animal Protection and Shelter for its professionalism and providing its visitor with a \"sober ride home\".Officer Martin said it was \"just another day in the life of an animal control officer\".

Witnesses said the initial strike had targeted a tent inside the al-Mawasi displacement area, followed by blasts near the Kuwait hospital, prompting panic among families sheltering nearby.Hamas called Israel's action barbaric, indiscriminate and a violation of the ceasefire which began on 10 October.The Israeli military launched its offensive in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 70,100 Palestinians have since been killed as a result of Israel's campaign, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "South Korean authorities are developing a mobile app for stalking victims to track in real-time the location of their stalkers, if they're nearby.The app, announced by South Korea's justice ministry on Wednesday, is part of an approved amendment to the country's electronic monitoring law.Stalkers have become a subject of public concern in South Korea, especially as high-profile crimes involving stalking have made headlines in recent years.Under the current law, stalking victims can receive text message alerts when their stalkers are nearby - though these do not reveal stalkers' exact locations.This makes it difficult for victims to determine the direction of the perpetrator, the justice ministry said in a statement.Under the revised law, victims will be allowed to see their stalker's location on a map with their smartphones, allowing them to evacuate to safety.Authorities track stalkers' whereabouts using wearable electronic devices.The justice ministry said it was also working on integrating the tracking system into the national emergency hotline, so police could be deployed to protect victims as needed.This integration is expected to be completed next year, local media reported.Critics have voiced concern over the pervasiveness of stalking in South Korea, which they see as part of a wider problem of violence against women - many of whom have been secretly filmed by spy cameras and faced hostile threats for being feminists.In 2022, public anger erupted over the murder of a young woman by her male ex-colleague, who had been stalking her for years. Although she had reported him to the police, he was not detained or given a restraining order as authorities viewed him as \"low risk\".In 2021, South Korea introduced an anti-stalking law that carries up to three years of jail for offenders and a maximum fine of 30 million Korean won ($20,400; £15,300).In 2023, South Korea's parliament revised the law to lower the barrier to prosecuting stalkers.The number of reports against stalkers have surged since then, from 7,600 in 2022 to more than 13,000 last year, according to data from the justice ministry.",

    "body": "Singapore's opposition leader Pritam Singh has lost his appeal against a guilty verdict of lying to a parliamentary committee.In February, Singh was fined S$14,000 ($10,800; £8,100) for two charges related to his handling of Raeesah Khan, a former lawmaker from his party who confessed to lying to parliament.In a short hearing to a packed court public gallery on Friday, the judge said Singh's conviction was supported by the evidence provided.Singh, who leads the main opposition Workers' Party, said that he was \"disappointed\" with the decision but accepted it \"fully and without reservation\". He paid his fines at the courthouse after the hearing on Friday. \"Might as well get it done,\" he told reporters.Singh retains his seat in parliament despite the conviction, and said on Friday that he would keep serving Singaporeans along with his colleagues.The Workers' Party is the the only opposition party in Singapore's current parliament, where it holds 12 out of 99 seats.The saga began in 2021, when Khan claimed in parliament that she had witnessed the police misbehave towards a sexual assault victim.She later admitted that her anecdote was not true, but said during a parliamentary committee investigation that the party's leaders, including Singh, had told her to \"continue with the narrative\" despite knowing about the lie.Khan has since resigned from the party and parliament. She was fined S$35,000 for lying and abusing her parliamentary privilege.In February, the court ruled that Singh's actions were \"strongly indicative\" that he had not wanted Khan to clarify her lie.But Singh, who maintained his innocence throughout the trial, argued that he had wanted to give Khan time to deal with what was a sensitive issue.During Singh's appeal hearing in November, his lawyer argued that the court had \"ignored crucial pieces of evidence\" in its ruling.Singh's lawyer also sought to cast doubt on the credibility of Khan and her aides, who served as witnesses.When the judge asked why Singh seemed to be \"doing nothing\" to get Khan to own up in the weeks after learning about her lie in parliament, Singh's lawyer said that he had other urgent professional and personal matters to deal with.However, the prosecution argued that Singh's inaction, along with other pieces of evidence, proved that he had never intended for Khan to come clean.Singh's case stands out as one of the only criminal convictions against a sitting opposition lawmaker.Critics have previously accused Singapore's government of using the judiciary to go after its political opponents - charges the authorities have always denied.",

    "body": "A prominent Palestinian militia leader in Gaza who opposed Hamas has been killed.Yasser Abu Shabab headed the so-called Popular Forces group, which has dozens of fighters and operates in Israeli-controlled territory near the southern city of Rafah.The Popular Forces said in a statement that Abu Shabab was shot while \"attempting to resolve a dispute\" between members of the Abu Seneima family. It dismissed as \"misleading\" reports that he was killed by Hamas, which had accused him of collaborating with Israel.An earlier statement from Abu Shabab's Bedouin tribe, the Tarabin, said he had been killed \"at the hands of the resistance\", and accused him of betraying the Palestinian people.Other sources said his death was the result of an internal power struggle.A Hamas statement said the \"fate that befell\" Abu Shabab was \"the inevitable fate of all who betray their people and homeland and are content to be tools in the hands of the occupation [Israel]\", without claiming involvement in his killing.Israel's Army Radio cited a security source as saying that Abu Shabab had died of his wounds after being evacuated to Soroka hospital in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba. But the hospital denied that he died under their care.The statement from the Popular Forces pledged to continue on Abu Shabab's \"path until the last terrorist is eliminated from the soil of Gaza and a bright and secure future is built for our people, who believe in peace\".In June, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that Israel was arming Palestinian clans in Gaza that he said were opposed to Hamas.It came after Israeli media reported that he had authorised the supply of weapons to the Popular Forces. However, the militia denied that it was being armed by Israel.The Popular Forces have been accused of looting humanitarian aid trucks sent into Gaza during the war, which the militia has also denied. Reports in Israel have also suggested that two of its members have previous links to the Islamic State group (IS).Since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began almost eight weeks ago, Abu Shabab had reportedly been one of several anti-Hamas militia leaders jostling for position in the second phase of US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan.It would involve setting up an interim government, deploying an international stabilisation force, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, and the disarmament of Hamas.Under the first phase, Hamas agreed to return all 48 living and dead hostages it was still holding in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails, as well as a partial Israeli withdrawal and a surge in humanitarian aid.The body of one dead Israeli hostage is yet to be returned.Israel's government has previously said it would not join talks on the second phase until Hamas has returned all the hostages. However, Trump said on Wednesday that the second phase was \"going to happen pretty soon\".The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 70,120 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "The Israeli military has carried out a new round of air strikes in southern Lebanon, less than a day after Israel and Lebanon held their first direct talks in decades.Residents of the towns of Mjadel, Baraachit, Jbaa and Mahrouna were told to evacuate areas around locations that the Israeli military alleged were weapons warehouses belonging to the Iranian-backed group. No casualties have been reported.An Israeli military spokesman said the sites constituted a ceasefire violation and warned that it would continue to operate \"to remove any threat\" to Israel. Israel has carried out near-daily strikes on Lebanon since a ceasefire took effect in November 2024, following 13 months of conflict.There was no immediate comment from Lebanon's leaders in response to Thursday's strikes. Lebanese politicians have previously condemned similar strikes as ceasefire violations.Under the first phase of a deal brokered by the US and France, Israeli troops were to withdraw from southern Lebanon, while Hezbollah was to remove its fighters and weapons from south of the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) from the border with Israel - a plan the group and its allies oppose.Israel has maintained positions at several strategic border sites and stepped up its air strikes in recent weeks. It is an escalation officials say is driven by Hezbollah's attempts to rebuild its military infrastructure and what they see as limited Lebanese government efforts to disarm the group.Thursday's strikes came less than 24 hours after Israel and Lebanon sent civilian envoys to the Lebanese border town of Naqoura for their first direct talks in decades.The talks, hosted at the headquarters of the UN peacekeeping mission, Unifil, took place during a meeting of the ceasefire monitoring committee, which until now had only included military officers from the US, France, Lebanon, Israel and Unifil.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying the meeting \"took place in a good atmosphere\" and that it \"was agreed that ideas would be formulated to advance possible economic cooperation between Israel and Lebanon\".It also said that Israeli envoys \"clarified that the disarmament of Hezbollah is obligatory, regardless of the advancement of economic co-operation\".Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam was more cautious, saying Lebanon remained \"far\" from diplomatic normalisation with Israel and that the talks were focused on \"defusing tension\".\"We are not yet at peace talks,\" he told reporters, saying Lebanon's priorities were the cessation of hostilities, the release of Lebanese detainees held by Israel, and Israel's full withdrawal from its territory.He added that Beirut was open to the deployment of French and US troops to help verify efforts to disarm Hezbollah.The latest strikes and diplomatic moves coincide with a visit by a UN Security Council delegation to Lebanon to review the stalled implementation of the ceasefire.",

On social media, Trump said he would issue a \"full and unconditional\" pardon of the Texas representative and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, who was also charged in the case.\"Henry, I don't know you, but you can sleep well tonight - Your nightmare is finally over!\" the president, a Republican, wrote.

Cuellar and his wife, who posted bail after they were charged, maintain their innocence. On Wednesday morning Cuellar filed for re-election as a Democrat, scotching speculation that he might be poised to switch parties and pad the Republicans' narrow majority in the House.Biden's Department of Justice had alleged that Cuellar, who has been representing Texas' 28th congressional district since 2005, illicitly received money from an Azerbaijani government-owned oil company and a Mexican bank.The indictment alleged that, in exchange for the money, Cuellar agreed to influence US foreign policy in favour of Azerbaijan - and to advocate for measures that would benefit the Mexico City bank.Companies owned by Imelda Cuellar allegedly laundered the money, which the family used to pay off debts and make purchases.Among them was $58,000 (£46,000) in credit card payments, $18,000 at wholesale stores and $12,000 for a custom gown, the indictment said.The couple faced charges of conspiracy, bribery, wire fraud, money laundering and violating a ban on acting as agents of a foreign organisation.Though he's a Democrat, Cuellar's politics sit to the right of many members of his party. He's been called the \"last pro-life Democrat\" for his moderate stance on abortion. \"My faith is clear: abortion must be rare and safe,\" he has said in the past. In a letter to Trump, Cuellar's daughters also said they believe their father's stance on immigration may have led to his arrest. They wrote that their father believed in \"securing the border\" and that his \"independence and honesty\" may have been the reason behind his indictment. Trump seemed to agree, saying on Truth Social that Biden \"went after the Congressman, and even the Congressman's wonderful wife, Imelda, simply for speaking the TRUTH\".This is Trump's third act of clemency this week. He pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras, who was found guilty in March 2024 of conspiring to import cocaine to the US, and of possessing machine guns.On Monday, Trump also commuted the sentence of former investment manager David Gentile, who was just days into a seven-year prison sentence for fraud.So far in his second term, the president has pardoned or commuted the sentences of multiple people convicted of various types of fraud or financial crimes.

    "body": "Three French teens drown after car crashes upside down in swimming pool1 day agoLaura GozziAFPFirefighters were called several hours after the accident to remove the car from the pool (file pic)Three teenagers were killed when their car skidded off the road in southern France, went through a wall and crashed upside down in a private pool, trapping them inside. The vehicle was a similar size to the pool and the teenagers - aged 14, 15 and 19 - were unable to open the doors and drowned.The freak accident occurred in the town of Alès in the early hours of Wednesday. \"It's truly the height of horror,\" said public prosecutor Abdelkrim Grini. \"It wasn't the impact of the accident that killed them. They found themselves upside down in icy water, unable to get out. They had no chance.\" Unconfirmed reports suggest the youngest of the three victims was at the wheel of the car at the time.The accident, which happened during a night of heavy rain, was the result of an \"unbelievable series of circumstances,\" the prosecutor told AFP news agency.The prosecutor described how the car had smashed through a low-level garden wall, flipped over and landed \"with all four wheels in the air\".It was not for several hours that the alarm was raised and firefighters were called to drain the pool and remove the vehicle. BFMTV reported that the pool was about 1.5m (5ft) deep.A mangled car was pulled on to a firefighters' truck during the morning and video from the scene showed the private swimming pool next to the collapsed wall. Canisters of nitrous oxide were found in the car, according to French reports. The substance is used by recreational users as it can make people feel relaxed, light-headed or dizzy.An investigation has been opened into the cause of death. The three victims' bodies  have been taken to the forensic institute in Nîmes for post mortem examinations, AFP said.",

    "body": "President Vladimir Putin has warned again that Ukrainian troops must withdraw from Ukraine's eastern Donbas region or Russia will seize it, rejecting any compromise over how to end the war in Ukraine.\"Either we liberate these territories by force, or Ukrainian troops will leave these territories,\" he told India Today. Moscow controls around 85% of Donbas.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out ceding territory.Putin's comments come after President Donald Trump said his negotiators discussing a US peace plan believed Russia's leader \"would like to end the war\" after Tuesday's talks in Moscow.Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff, who was in Moscow, is due to meet Ukraine's team in Florida.Trump said Tuesday's talks in the Kremlin were \"reasonably good\", adding it was too soon to say what would happen as \"it does take two to tango\".The original iteration of the US peace plan proposed to hand over areas of the Donbas still under Ukrainian control to the de facto control of Putin - but the Witkoff team presented a modified version in Moscow.In his India Today interview ahead of a state visit to Delhi, Putin said he had not seen the new version before his talks with Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law.\"That's why we had to go over every point, that's why it took so long,\" the Kremlin leader said.He also said Moscow disagreed with parts of the US plan.\"At times we said that yes, we can discuss this, but to that we can't agree,\" Putin said.He did not name the sticking points. At least two significant points of contention remain - the fate of Ukrainian territory seized by Russian forces and security guarantees for Ukraine.Putin's senior foreign policy adviser and key negotiator Yuri Ushakov earlier said straight after the talks that they produced \"no compromise\" on ending the war.Ushakov also implied that the Russian negotiating position had been strengthened thanks to what Moscow said were its recent successes on the battlefield.Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of stalling any ceasefire agreements, saying Moscow is seeking to seize more Ukrainian territory.Commenting on the Kremlin talks, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybhia said  Putin was \"wasting the world's time\".Ukraine has long insisted on firm security guarantees for Ukraine in any deal.On Wednesday, Zelensky said \"the world clearly feels that there is a real opportunity to end the war\" - but negotiations must be \"backed by pressure on Russia\", which Kyiv and its European allies accuse of deliberately stalling any ceasefire agreements.The Ukrainian president said last week his top negotiators had managed to make some key changes in the original US peace plan - seen as strongly favouring Moscow - during talks with an American delegation in Geneva on 23 November.In a joint statement, US and Ukrainian negotiators said at the time that they had drawn up an \"updated and refined peace framework\" - but provided no further details.Top negotiators from Europe - who had voiced concern over the original US plan - were also in the Swiss city last week, meeting separately with the Ukrainian and the US teams.In a separate development on Thursday, Germany's Der Spiegel news website said it had obtained a confidential transcript of a conference call in which European leaders expressed concern over the US negotiations.\"There is a possibility that the US will betray Ukraine on the issue of territory without clarity on security guarantees,\" French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly said, according to an English transcript of Monday's conference call.Meanwhile, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz was quoted as warning that Zelensky had to be \"extremely careful in the coming days\".\"They are playing games, both with you and with us,\" Merz reportedly said.Finnish President Alexander Stubb was also quoted as saying: \"We mustn't leave Ukraine and Volodymyr alone with these guys.\"The BBC has not seen the reported transcript. In response to a Der Spiegel inquiry, France's Élysée Palace stated that \"the president did not express himself in those terms\". The presidential office declined to provide details on how Macron expressed himself, citing confidentiality.Stubb declined to comment to Der Spiegel, and Merz has not commented on the issue.In a statement to the BBC, the White House said: \"Secretary [Marco] Rubio, Special Envoy Witkoff, Mr Kushner, and the President's entire national security team are working tirelessly to stop the killing between Russia and Ukraine.\"\"They have held productive meetings to gather feedback from both sides on a plan that can foster a durable, enforceable peace,\" the statement read.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.In recent weeks, Russian troops have been slowly advancing in south-east Ukraine, despite reported heavy combat casualties.",

His body was then taken to Gaza and held hostage by Palestinian Islamic Jihad.His mother, On, told Israeli Army Radio that it was \"hard for us to digest the news\" after being informed that his body had been recovered by PIJ fighters in northern Gaza.\"Two years have passed,\" she said. \"We felt great sadness when we knew he was no longer among the living.\"Israeli President Isaac Herzog wrote on X: \"For 789 painful days, Suthisak was held hostage in Gaza. His family back in Thailand have waited in agony for his return. Now, Suthisak can finally be laid to rest with dignity.\"\"Hamas's cruelty continues. Ran Gvili, a police officer who fought and fell heroically on October 7th, is still being held hostage in Gaza. When we say we won't stop until every last hostage is home, we mean it.\"A spokesperson for Thailand's foreign ministry thanked the Israeli government for the assistance that led to the return of all 31 Thai nationals who were among the 251 people taken hostage during the 7 October attack. Another 39 Thai nationals were among the 1,200 people killed that day.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 70,100 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.ReutersPalestinian Islamic Jihad said it had found the body of a hostage in northern GazaUnder the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.So far, the remains of 23 dead Israeli hostages have been handed over, along with those of four foreign hostages - two of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.In exchange, Israel has handed over the bodies of 345 Palestinians killed during the war.The seven-week-old ceasefire has continued to look shaky, with Israel and Hamas accusing each other of repeated violations.On Wednesday night, an Israeli air strike killed five Palestinians, including two children, at a camp for displaced families in the al-Mawasi area of southern Gaza, a hospital said.Israel's military said it targeted a \"Hamas terrorist\" in retaliation for an earlier attack by Hamas fighters in the Rafah area that wounded five Israeli soldiers.Hamas said the Israeli strike constituted a \"clear war crime\".Speaking to journalists at the White House, US President Donald Trump said the next stage of his Gaza peace plan - which includes plans for the post-war governance, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction - was \"going to happen pretty soon\".\"They had a problem today, I understand, with a bomb that went off,\" Trump said. \"Hurt some people pretty badly… But it's going very well. We have peace in the Middle East. People don't realise it.\"",

    "body": "1 day agoSteve RosenbergBBC Russia editorWhat does the latest round of diplomacy on Ukraine tell us about Russian President Vladimir Putin's mood and intentions?For starters, that he's not ready to sign a peace deal. At least, not right now.And certainly not the deal (or deals) on the table.\"No compromise version has yet been found,\" commented Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov after five hours of talks in Moscow involving Putin, US envoy Steve Witkoff, and Donald Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner.No compromise is no real surprise, considering the Kremlin leader's uncompromising comments in recent days. In various statements he has condemned the Ukrainian leadership as a \"thieving junta\", accused European leaders of trying to sabotage peace efforts, and insisted that Russia holds the initiative on the battlefield.On a couple of recent occasions Russian TV showed Putin in military fatigues, studying maps of the front line and trumpeting military gains, many of which Ukraine and international observers have denied.After nearly four years of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, despite the heavy losses Russia has suffered on the battlefield and the damage to the Russian economy, President Putin seems convinced that he is winning this war and that now is not the moment to stop.At least, that is what he would like the West to believe: that nothing can stop him now from achieving his goals.I've said before that, in many ways, Vladimir Putin reminds me of a car with no brakes, no steering wheel and no reverse gear; a vehicle careering full speed down the motorway.Nearly four years after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine there is still no sign of the \"Putinmobile\" turning off, turning back, or coming to a halt.He certainly wants his opponents to think that nothing or no one can force him to change direction: neither European leaders, nor the Trump administration, nor President Zelensky.But cars need fuel (a constant supply).And, to fight a war, countries need money (a constant supply).For now, despite international sanctions, Russia's government is still able to finance the \"special military operation\" - its war on Ukraine. But economic pressures are building: revenues from oil and gas have been falling, the budget deficit growing.Even Putin admits there are problems, referring to \"imbalances\" in the economy.\"In several sectors, production output not only failed to increase this year but actually decreased,\" Putin said this week. \"Are we satisfied with such trends? No.\"The big unknown: at what point, if at all, will economic concerns start to influence the Kremlin's calculations on the battlefield?",

    "body": "4 hours agoAlice CuddySenior international reporterThe parents of the last dead hostage in Gaza have spoken to the BBC about their desperate wait for his body to be returned.Itzik and Talik Gvili insisted the Gaza peace deal could not progress until Hamas handed over the remains of their son Ran, a 24-year-old Israeli police officer also known as Rani.\"We really hope that all people in the world... want to end this situation and go to the second phase, so Hamas must bring Rani home,\" his mother Talik said, after Israel confirmed the body of Thai national Suthisak Rintalak had been returned on Wednesday.He and Ran were among 251 people taken hostage in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, when another 1,200 people were killed.Ran was killed while fighting Hamas gunmen in Kibbutz Alumim, and his body was subsequently taken to Gaza as a hostage, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).His parents said he was on medical leave with a broken shoulder at the time of the attacks but went to fight after seeing on television what was happening.\"He couldn't stay at home even though he was injured. He took my car and his uniform... and went to help in the fight against the terrorists,\" said his father Itzik.\"He saved Kibbutz Alumim... and he saved Israel, so Israel has to save him now and bring him back home,\" he added.While the couple have been told by Israeli officials that Ran was killed, they say they are still holding onto \"a little percent\" of hope \"that maybe he's alive, maybe he's survived\".\"We want closure,\" said Talik.Speaking during a visit to London, Ran's parents described their pain over the past 26 months, much of which they have spent campaigning for the return of all the living and dead hostages.Under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the final 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza, but it has taken weeks for the bodies of the dead hostages to be returned, often only one at a time.\"When Hamas bring one of the hostages home we don't know who it is, maybe it's Rani, maybe it's someone else… It's like roulette. You cannot imagine the fright and the hope and everything. Sometimes it's not a hostage\" at all, said Talik, referring to  several sets of remains handed over that have turned out to belong to dead Palestinians.\"My wish is that no mother will feel what I feel in the whole world. We are strong people, but what is inside, you cannot imagine… They stole my child and I can do nothing - just pray and come to visit people and beg for help.\"Talik said she had not slept for a full night since 7 October 2023.\"You feel that you have 5,000 kilos on your chest. We don't have night. We don't have day. We have nothing,\" she said.While they are now the only people in Israel waiting for a loved one to be returned from Gaza, they said the support around them has grown.\"All the families are together with us and all Israeli people are with us. It [the support] is bigger than before because all Israeli people are now focused on one thing - bring Ran home and then do the second phase [of the peace deal],\" said Talik.The couple said that after Ran's return, they hoped for lasting peace and for Hamas to be dismantled.\"We are very proud of Ran. He's a hero in Israel. Hamas made Ran a hero... We want him back and to try to sleep well and breathe well again.\"Earlier on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also described Ran as a \"hero of Israel\", saying he had \"eliminated 14 terrorists and did so with the utmost bravery\" before being killed in battle.\"We are determined to bring Ran back for a proper Jewish burial and we will spare no effort to do so,\" he vowed.Israel responded to the 7 October 2023 attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 70,120 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "Suspect arrested in pipe bomb incident on eve of 2021 Capitol riot1 hour agoNadine YousifBBC NewsWatch: FBI releases new video in hunt for 6 January pipe bomb suspectA Virginia man has been arrested in connection with two pipe bombs placed outside the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic national committees on the eve of the 2021 Capitol riot.US Attorney General Pam Bondi said Brian Cole Jr, 30, was arrested without incident early on Thursday morning. He is charged with use of an explosive device and attempted malicious destruction by means of explosive materials. Officials did not specify a possible motive for the planting of the pipe bombs, which were safely deactivated without exploding.It caps an exhaustive investigation in a case where an arrest had eluded law enforcement despite a $500,000 (£375,000) reward. The FBI did not receive new information or a tip that cracked the case, officials said. Both bombs were placed on the night of 5 January 2021 and were only discovered the following afternoon as supporters of Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol in the last days of his first presidency. Kamala Harris, who was the US vice president-elect at the time, was evacuated from the Democratic National Committee headquarters shortly after the devices were found.According to court documents, the suspect lives with his parents in Woodbridge, a suburb about 20 miles (32km) outside Washington.He works for a bail bond company - such firms help people get out of jail by posting bail on their behalf in exchange for a non-refundable fee.Watch: Aerial video shows FBI at pipe bomb suspect's homeInvestigators sifted through a mountain of evidence gathered over the years, including some three million lines of data.Mr Cole allegedly bought multiple bomb-making components in 2019 and 2020, according to the court filing.He purchased metal end caps, wires and steel wool at Home Depot and Lowes hardware stores, batteries at another retailer and timers at a Walmart in northern Virginia, an FBI affidavit states.Investigators found mobile phone data that showed Mr Cole was near the locations of the pipe bombs when they were planted between 19:39 and 20:24 local time on 5 January 2021.His car - a 2017 Nissan Sentra with a Virginia licence plate - was also seen by a licence plate reader less than half a mile (0.8km) from the location where the individual who placed the devices was first observed in the area.US Attorney Jeanine Pirro told a news conference on Thursday that the Trump administration had made solving the case a priority.\"It was like finding a needle in a haystack,\" she said.Investigators said both pipe bombs were manufactured using end caps, with Pirro adding there were 233,000 black-end caps of the type used in the plot. \"I want you to think about the act that the FBI had to go through the sale of every one of them,\" she added.The suspect's shoes were believed to be Nike Air Max Speed Turfs.The FBI discovered thousands of pairs of the shoes had been distributed through more than two dozen retailers.Watch: Attorney General Pam Bondi announces charges against pipe bomb suspectFBI officials praised the perseverance of agents and said they never gave up on finding a suspect. \"We continued to churn through massive amounts of data\", said Darren Cox, deputy assistant director of the FBI Criminal Investigative Division.Earlier this year, the FBI released CCTV footage of an individual with a backpack and light grey hooded sweater placing something near a bench outside the DNC building in Washington. The person was shown later walking to place the second bomb.FBI Director Kash Patel told the news conference that \"when you attack American citizens, when you attack our nation's capital, you attack the very being of our way of life\".\"We will provide the safest country the nation has ever seen,\" he added.FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said the case showed people are not able to \"walk into our capital city\", plant devices and \"walk off into the sunset\", adding that US law enforcement will \"track you down to the end of the earth\".The pipe bomb plot spawned countless conspiracy theories, including that US law enforcement might have been involved.Before he took the job of FBI deputy director, Bongino floated the possibility last year that it was an \"inside job\" and a \"massive cover-up.\"",

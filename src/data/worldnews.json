    "body": "An Australian senator has provoked anger for wearing a burka in parliament, after pushing for a ban on the Muslim garment.Pauline Hanson was condemned by fellow senators, with one accusing her of \"blatant racism\". Proceedings in the senate were halted as she refused to remove the item. The Queensland senator, of the anti-immigration One Nation party, was seeking to introduce a bill that would ban full face coverings in public – a policy she has long campaigned for.It is the second time she has worn the garment – which covers the face and body – in parliament, and said her actions were in protest at the senate rejecting her bill.Shortly after other lawmakers blocked her from introducing the bill on Monday, she returned wearing a black burka.\"This is a racist senator, displaying blatant racism,\" said Mehreen Faruqi, a Muslim  Greens senator from New South Wales.Fatima Payman, an independent senator from the state of Western Australia, called the stunt \"disgraceful\".Foreign Minister Penny Wong, who serves as leader of the government in the senate, condemned it as \"disrespectful\". \"We represent in our states, people of every faith, of every faith of all backgrounds. And we should do so decently,\" she said.She added Hanson was \"not worthy of a member of the Australian Senate\" and moved a motion to suspend Hanson for failing to remove the garment. In a post on Facebook, Hanson wrote \"If they don't want me wearing it - ban the burka.\"She previously wore a burka to parliament in 2017, also calling for a national ban at the time.In 2016, Hanson was criticised for her maiden speech to the Australian senate, in which she said the country was in danger of being \"swamped by Muslims\".It echoed her controversial 1996 speech in which she warned that the country was in danger of being \"swamped by Asians\".",

    "body": "13 hours agoCaroline Davies,Pakistan correspondent, Islamabad,Azizullah Khan,BBC Urdu, PeshawarandKelly NgTwo suicide bombers have attacked the headquarters of a Pakistani paramilitary force on Monday, killing three security officials and wounding at least 12 people.Police told BBC Urdu that the attackers were armed as they charged at the Federal Constabulary's headquarters in Peshawar in north-western Pakistan.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.The constabulary's complex is located in a highly secured area in Peshawar, and the attackers would have had to breach multiple levels of security to break in.Witnesses told local media they heard two loud explosions at around 08:10 local time (03:10 GMT) on Monday. The area has been cordoned off and rescue teams are currently on site. One official said five security officials and seven civilians were injured.Pakistan authorities have described the attack as a \"foiled terrorist plot\", noting that the attackers were gunned down at the gate, before they managed to enter the building.\"The perpetrators of this incident should be identified as soon as possible and brought to justice,\" said Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Pakistan's Federal Constabulary, previously known as the Frontier Constabulary, is responsible for handling situations beyond the capabilities of the police force, including tribal incursions and criminal gang violence.Peshawar is part of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which sits along the border Afghanistan and has long been a flashpoint for militant violence.The Pakistani Taliban, also known as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), is active in the province and had claimed responsibility for similar attacks across the country.Two weeks ago, a suicide attack outside a court in Pakistan's capital Islamabad killed 12 people and injured at least 27 others. Pakistan blamed India and Afghanistan, without proof. Both countries rejected these accusations.The TTP eventually claimed responsibility for the attack.In February this year, six people were killed in a suicide attack at an Islamic seminary in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The attack came ahead of the start of the holy month of Ramadan.No group has yet claimed responsibility for that attack.",

    "body": "12 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentGetty ImagesJimmy Cliff's hits included Many Rivers To Cross, Wonderful World, Beautiful People and You Can Get It If You Really WantJimmy Cliff, one of the most prominent and beloved proponents of reggae music, has died at the age of 81.A star since the 1960s, he helped to bring the sound of Jamaica to a global audience through hits such as Wonderful World, Beautiful People and You Can Get It If You Really Want.His lead role as a gun-toting rebel in the 1972 crime drama The Harder They Come is a cornerstone of Jamaican cinema, and was attributed as the movie that brought reggae to America.Cliff's wife, Latifa Chambers, announced his death via a statement on Instagram.\"It's with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia,\" she wrote.\"I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists and coworkers who have shared his journey with him. \"To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career.\"Jimmy, my darling, may you rest in peace. I will follow your wishes.\" Her message was also signed by their children, Lilty and Aken.Getty ImagesBorn James Chambers in 1944, Cliff grew up as the eighth of nine children in abject poverty in the parish of St. James, Jamaica.Blessed with a sweet, mellifluous voice, he began singing at his local church at the age of six.He was inspired to write his own material when he heard ska pioneer Derrick Morgan on the radio - and asked his woodwork teacher how one might go about composing their own song. “He told me, ‘You just write it!’“ he told Mojo magazine. ”So I went ahead and… wrote a song called I Need A Fiancée, another called Sob Sob and I made a guitar out of bamboo to accompany myself.”By the time he was 14, he'd moved to Kingston and adopted the surname Cliff to express the heights he intended on reaching.He recorded a handful of singles before topping the Jamaican charts with his own composition, Hurricane Hattie. In 1965, he relocated to London to work with Island Records - later the home of Bob Marley - but the label's attempts to make his sound palatable to rock audiences were initially unsuccessful.He eventually struck gold with the 1969 single Wonderful World, Beautiful People - an upbeat, feelgood anthem; and the more politically-charged Vietnam, which Bob Dylan called \"the best protest song ever written\".Its lyric tells the story of a young soldier who writes from the war, promising his mother he'll be home soon; only for her to receive a telegram the next day, informing her of his death.Cliff reflected on the song in 1986, telling reggae archivist Roger Steffens: \"The essence of my music is struggle. What gives it the icing is the hope of love.\"Getty ImagesThe Harder They Come had to be subtitled in the US because of the character's thick Jamaican patoisThe musician became an international star with The Harder They Come, expressly written for the movie of the same name, in which he played Ivan Martin, a young man trying to break into Jamaica's corrupt music industry.\"The film opened the door for Jamaica,\" Cliff recalled. \"It said, 'This is where this music comes from.'\"BBC Sounds: Witness - Jimmy Cliff on The Harder They ComeBBC 6 Music: The First Time with Jimmy CliffCliff contributed four songs to the soundtrack, including the gospel hymn Many Rivers To Cross, which reflected his early days as a struggling artist in the UK.\"I was still in my teens,\" he later recalled. \"I came full of vigour: I'm going to make it, I'm going to be up there with the Beatles and the Stones.\"\"And it wasn't really going like that, I was touring clubs, not breaking through. I was struggling, with work, life, my identity. I couldn't find my place. Frustration fuelled the song.\"Instead, the film and its soundtrack won him international acclaim. Rolling Stone magazine even named it one of their top 500 albums of all time.During the 1980s, he collaborated with the Rolling Stones on their Dirty Work album, and he returned to the US charts in 1993 with his cover of I Can See Clearly Now, from the soundtrack for Cool Runnings, which followed the escapades of Jamaica's bobsled team.His other recordings included the Grammy Award-winning albums Cliff Hanger (1985) and Rebirth (2012), a nostalgic return to form.Cliff entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010, calling it \"a great thrill and an honour\".Inducting him, Fugees star Wyclef Jean said he'd been inspired by Cliff's success as a young boy growing up in Haiti.\"When we saw Jimmy Cliff, we saw ourselves,\" he said.Cliff continued to tour late into his life, playing Glastonbury's legends slot in 2003; and winning over a new generation of fans at the 2010 Coachella Festival.His contributions to Jamaican music and culture were recognised in October 2003 when he was awarded the country's prestigious Order of Merit.But the singer said his connection to fans was more important than any of the other honours bestowed upon him.Speaking to US radio station NPR in 2012, he reflected: \"When someone comes up to me and says, 'I was a dropout in school and I heard your song You Can Get It If You Really Want, and that song made me go back to school, and now I am a teacher and I use your song with my students' - that, for me, is a big success.\"",

    "body": "17 hours agoGavin ButlerNews1 / Seoul Metropolitan PolicePolice released a mugshot of Kim Nok-wan to Korean mediaThe leader of a Telegram sex crime ring which facilitated the exchange of thousands of sexual abuse materials has been sentenced to life imprisonment in South Korea.Kim Nok-wan, 33, was the head of the so-called Vigilantes: a large-scale, pyramid-style group that blackmailed victims into producing explicit content and sharing it in online chatrooms.Between May 2020 and January 2025, the Vigilantes exploited at least 261 individuals – the largest number of cybersex exploitation victims in South Korea's history.Under the self-designated title of \"pastor\", Kim was found to have carried out systematic crimes including the sexual assault of minors and the distribution of images that show child sex abuse.He was sentenced on Monday after being convicted for organising and operating a criminal organisation, producing and distributing sexually exploitative and illegally filmed material, forcing the use of illegally filmed material, and \"quasi-rape\" or sexual assault where the victim was unable to resist.\"[Kim Nok-wan] says in court that he is remorseful, but he committed countless crimes over the past four to five years,\" the court said.\"Considering the brutality of the crimes and the lack of restitution for victims, it is necessary to permanently isolate him from society.\"Kim sought out both male and female targets through social networking platforms, luring them to the instant-messaging service Telegram before blackmailing them, according to police.He approached men who expressed interest in creating or distributing deepfake images, and women who expressed sexual curiosity, then threatened to disclose their personal information or report them to authorities.Some of these victims would subsequently be recruited into the Vigilantes pyramid scheme – allocated titles such as \"evangelist\" and \"deacon\" - so that they could bring in further victims.Kim ordered both adult and child victims to submit \"hourly daily reports\" and write letters of remorse, punishing those who failed to do so by forcing them to take nude photographs or harm themselves.The quantity of sexually exploitative materials produced by the Vigilantes exceeded 2,000 pieces of media.As its ringleader, Kim also raped ten under-aged women, forced women to have sexual intercourse with other men and filmed himself committing brutal acts that caused injury, police added.He was found to have participated in at least 453 Telegram channels and chat rooms for the purpose of committing his crimes - 60 of which he operated personally.The case marks the first time Telegram has cooperated with South Korean police, providing crime-related data that facilitated further investigations and led to Kim's arrest.The Korean National Police Agency established a formal system of investigative cooperation with Telegram in October 2024, enabling the platform to officially provide authorities with relevant information.",

    "body": "Illinois police captured Morgan Geyser, who was convicted in the 2014 stabbing of a classmate to appease Slender Man, an online character, after she fled a group home in neighbouring Wisconsin where she was being held.Police said Geyser, 23, removed her bracelet monitoring device and fled the home in Madison on Saturday night and was on the run until her capture on Sunday.Officers found her at a truck stop in Posen, Illinois, where they said Geyser told them to \"just Google\" her name and that she had \"done something really bad\".Geyser was 12 years old when she stabbed her classmate 19 times. She was sentenced to 40 years in a mental hospital in 2018 and granted conditional release in July.Geyser was found with a man at the truck stop just outside of Chicago - and about 170 miles south of Madison - after police received reports of a man and woman loitering.\"When officers arrived, they located both subjects sleeping on the sidewalk,\" Posen police said in a statement. \"The female repeatedly refused to provide her real name and initially gave a false one. \"After continued attempts to identify her, she finally stated that she didn't want to tell officers who she was because she had 'done something really bad,' and suggested that officers could 'just Google' her name.\"She and her companion were detained after police determined she was wanted in Wisconsin. CBS News, the BBC's US partner, reported the 42-year-old companion was charged with trespassing and obstructing identification and later released. The so-called \"Slender Man stabbing\" shocked Wisconsin and garnered national attention. Geyser and her friend Anissa Weier, also 12 at the time of the attack, lured a classmate to a park after a sleepover and Geyser stabbed the classmate repeatedly while Weier encouraged her to continue. The victim, 12-year-old Payton Leutner, survived the brutal attack and was found by a cyclist. Geyser and Weier were tried as adults. Geyser pleaded guilty to first-degree intentional homicide and was sentenced to 40 years. A judge allowed her release under supervision at the group home in July.Weier was charged with attempted murder and sentenced to 25 years in a psychiatric hospital but released in 2021.Geyser and Weier said they were inspired to attack their classmate after reading about Slender Man in a creepypasta, a short, online story designed to shock or scare the reader. Slender Man is a skinny, shadowy figure who has appeared in photos, drawings and articles across the internet. Some claim he has tentacles emerging from his back, and most say he wears dark clothes and has a pale face.The girls said they believed Slender Man would kill their relatives if they did not kill their friend to please him, an attorney for Geyser said in court. Authorities said the girls had hoped to live with Slender Man after the attack.Slender Man first appeared on the internet in 2009.The character was created by a Florida resident in response to a call for submissions from comedy website SomethingAwful. The character was pictured behind a crowd of people.After the stabbing, the website released an article urging people not to kill anyone because of Slender Man.",

    "body": "11 hours agoNomsa MasekoBBC Africa, JohannesburgOne of the daughters of Jacob Zuma, South Africa's former president, has filed a criminal complaint against her sister, accusing her of recruiting men from South Africa to fight in the Russia-Ukraine war.Nkosazana Zuma-Mncube alleged that Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, who serves as an MP, and two others tricked 17 men into fighting for Russian mercenaries.The men were told they were travelling to Russia to train as bodyguards for Jacob Zuma's political party Mkhonto Wesizwe (MK), Zuma-Mncube's statement says.The police say they are investigating the matter, while Zuma-Sambudla, aged 43, has not responded to the BBC's request for comment.South Africa's government previously said it had received distress calls from 17 citizens who had joined mercenary forces in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.The men, aged from 20 to 39, were lured to join the mercenary forces under the pretext of lucrative contracts, the government said.South Africa has an unemployment rate of more than 30%. Joblessness among young people is even higher, making them especially vulnerable for recruitment, analysts say.Zuma-Mncube said she had a \"moral obligation\" to file a police complaint against her younger sister.Earlier this week, international financial outlet Bloomberg reported similar allegations against Zuma-Sambudla and said some men had also been recruited from neighbouring Botswana.The allegations add to Zuma-Sambudla's legal woes - she is currently on trial over terrorism-related charges.The MP is being prosecuted over comments she made on social media four years ago during deadly protests in South Africa, following the arrest of her father.A week of anarchy in several parts of the country in July 2021, including looting and arson, left at least 300 people dead.Zuma-Sambudla has been accused of fuelling this unrest but she says the charges against her are politically motivated.Jacob Zuma was jailed for contempt of court for refusing to take part in an inquiry into allegations of corruption during his presidency that led to his sacking.He subsequently formed the MK party and led it to third place in last year's elections.The BBC has contacted MK and the Jacob Zuma Foundation for comment.",

    "body": "7 hours agoCachella SmithandPatrick JacksonBelgium is bracing for widespread disruption across sectors including public transport and schools this week as unions hold a three-day national strike. The action was called in response to Prime Minister Bart De Wever's attempts to shrink Belgium's debt by changing labour laws and reforming unemployment benefits and pensions. Teachers, medical staff and rubbish collectors will all be joining the rolling industrial action which is set to end in a general strike on Wednesday.  Eurostar is among organisations warning of potential disruption, while the two main airports have advised customers that all departure flights will be cancelled on Wednesday.The country had already been hit by several strikes since de Wever, a Flemish nationalist, came to office in February at the head of a centre-right coalition government aiming to cut the budget deficit.  Early on Monday, his government reached a budget agreement which he said was the only way to \"guarantee the sustainability\" of Belgium's welfare state. The country's budget deficit stood at 4.5% of GDP at the end of last year with debt at 104.7% of GDP.EU budget rules stipulate that member states should keep their budget deficit below 3% and debt beneath 60% to maintain sound public finances.This week's industrial action is meant to unfold in three stages, AFP news agency notes: Trains and other public transport went on strike on Monday, with national railroad company SNCB expecting to run one or two out of three trains, and several Eurostar services linking Brussels to Paris cancelledOn Tuesday, public services such as schools, creches and hospitals join inOn Wednesday a full general strike covers all categories including the two main airports, Bruxelles-Zaventem and Charleroi.Warning of the effect of the strike action in Belgium, Eurostar reported that some of its other international services had suffered delays as a result.  Defending the action, general workers union FGTB said a demonstration in Brussels two weeks ago had been met with \"total silence\" from the government. Fair pensions is a core issue cited by the unions while other demands include a fair wealth tax, a tax on digital activities for tech giants and the transparent screening of subsidies to companies.A day of action against violence against women separately took place on Sunday which the FGTB said formed part of the current action.Bruxelles-Zaventem airport has said it expects \"major disruptions\" to operations on Wednesday with all departure flights cancelled and some cancellations also possible for incoming flights.The airport said that staff from their security and handling service provider were expected to be participating in the national industrial action.Charleroi airport has similarly said it will not be able to operate either scheduled departures or arrivals on the day of the general strike - as it also warned passengers of potential disruption on public service networks throughout the strike period.The City of Brussels has warned of \"disrupted services\" on its public transport links throughout the three days of action while transport company, De Lijn, which operates in Flanders has advised there will be \"fewer bus and tram services\".",

    "body": "13 hours agoPaul NjieBBC Africa, YaoundéAFP via Getty ImagesTchiroma Bakary has vowed to resist President Paul Biya's governmentCameroonian opposition leader Issa Tchiroma Bakary, who is contesting the outcome of the presidential election, has fled to The Gambia for his safety, The Gambian government has said.Tchiroma Bakary has insisted he is the legitimate winner of the 12 October election, alleging that the result was rigged to give President Paul Biya, 92, an eighth term. The Gambian information ministry said on Sunday that Tchiroma Bakary arrived on 7 November and was allowed to stay on humanitarian grounds.Cameroon's government had threatened to put him on trial for allegedly inciting violent post-election demonstrations. He denied the allegation, and blamed the security forces for a crackdown on protesters.The government put the number of people killed in post-election violence at 16, but other organisations have given a higher death toll.Tchiroma Bakary has repeatedly promised to resist Biya's government until his \"victory\" in the election is recognised.Biya, the world's oldest president, has been in power for 43 years, and was declared the winner with 53.7% of the vote amid allegations of fraud. Tchiroma Bakary, who served in Biya's government for many years, came second with 35.2%.His resistance tactics have included calling for street protests and \"ghost town\" operations aimed at bringing cities and towns to a standstill.Until The Gambian government confirmed his presence, his whereabouts had remained a mystery although there was speculation that he had fled to another country in the region.\"He is being hosted temporarily in The Gambia purely on humanitarian grounds in the spirit of African solidarity and for the purpose of ensuring his safety while discussions continue to pursue a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to the post-electoral tensions in Cameroon,\" The Gambian government said in a statement.The Gambian authorities said the country would not be used as a \"base for subversive activity against any state\".The BBC has reached out to the Cameroonian government for comment.Reacting to the announcement, The Gambia's main opposition United Democratic Party (UDP) criticised the government for withholding the announcement of Tchiroma Bakary's arrival until Sunday.It said it raised \"serious questions about transparency, accountability, and respect for The Gambian people's right to know what actions are taken in their name\".However, the party said it was proud that Tchiroma Bakary could find \"safe sanctuary\" in The Gambia, adding that it was fully aware of how \"despotism operates and how dissenters are treated\".You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Zelensky welcomes amendments to proposed peace plan3 hours agoLaura GozziandPatrick JacksonRubio hails 'most productive day' of negotiations with UkraineUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has welcomed proposed changes to the controversial 28-point peace plan for ending the war with Russia.  It appears Ukraine's European allies produced an amended version of the plan after rejecting parts which favoured Russia's war aims.\"Now the list of necessary steps to end the war can become doable...\" Zelensky said on Telegram. \"Many correct elements have been incorporated into this framework.\" US and Ukrainian officials met in Geneva on Sunday to discuss the plan, drafted by American and Russian officials in October, which had caused consternation in Kyiv and among its European allies. Russian representatives did not take part in the meeting in Switzerland. A Kremlin official rejected the amendments on Monday as \"completely unconstructive\". In another development, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that the Trump administration was not favouring Russia in its efforts to end the war.\"The idea that the United States of America is not engaging with both sides equally in this war to bring it to an end is a complete and total fallacy,\" she told reporters.President Donald Trump was \"hopeful and optimistic\" that a plan could be worked out for ending the war, Leavitt added.Following the end of the talks in Geneva, Trump suggested on social media that \"something good just may be happening\" but added: \"Don't believe it until you see it.\"In Geneva, the talks began with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio having to deny the 28-point plan advocated by Trump had been written by the Kremlin, as several of its elements seemed heavily geared towards Moscow's longstanding demands.Zelensky said on Monday evening that the revised plan was \"truly the right approach\". \"The sensitive issues, the most delicate points, I will discuss with President Trump,\" he added, without saying when.According to an official in Zelensky's office, the 28-point plan leaked on Friday no longer existed. Speaking to the Financial Times, Ukraine's First Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergiy Kyslytsa, who attended the weekend talks in Geneva, said the latest plan consisted of just 19 points, with some of the most politically sensitive elements, including territorial concessions, now due to be decided by the leaders themselves.A virtual \"coalition of the willing\" meeting of Ukraine's European allies will take place on Tuesday to discuss developments, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced.There was, he said, still work to do for a \"just and lasting peace\" in Ukraine.In Moscow, Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters: \"The European plan, at first glance... is completely unconstructive and does not work for us.\"Zelensky said earlier on Monday that the \"main problem\" remained Putin's demand for legal recognition of territory Russia had taken.Comments by Trump which suggested Ukraine had until 27 November to accept the deal or risk losing US support created a sense of urgency across Europe on Friday, and talks between Ukraine and US officials were hastily convened.The counter-proposals - reportedly drafted by the UK, France and Germany - excluded any recognition of Russian-held regions, raised Ukraine's permitted army size, and left the door open to Ukraine joining Nato. Russia has consistently demanded full Ukrainian withdrawal from the whole of the eastern Donbas, made up of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. It also controls Crimea and large parts of two other regions, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.  Tens of thousands of soldiers and thousands of civilians have been killed or injured, and millions of people have fled their homes, since Russia's full-scale invasion began nearly four years ago.",

    "body": "Pioneering Australian chef Skye Gyngell has died aged 62.Gyngell rose to fame in the UK after her cafe at Petersham Nurseries in south-west London was awarded a coveted Michelin star, one of the highest culinary honours. She went on to helm Spring restaurant at Somerset House and Marle and Hearth at Heckfield Place in Hampshire.Gyngell's family said she died on Saturday in London, describing her as a \"culinary visionary who influenced generations of chefs and growers globally to think about food and its connection to the land\". Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver paid tribute to Gyngell - who was diagnosed with skin cancer last year - and thanked her for \"all you did to inspire young cooks\".During the 1980s, Gyngell pioneered the \"slow food movement\" before becoming a private chef for clients including Nigella Lawson, Madonna and Guy Ritchie.Lawson mourned her death, writing on Instagram, \"However ill you know someone to be, their death is always a shock. It's just awful that Skye is no longer in the world.\"Gyngell died just days after her mother, Ann Barr, who was a well-known interior designer.Her father, Bruce Gyngell, was the first person to appear on Australian television in 1956 with the line: \"Good evening, and welcome to television\". He died in 2000.Born in Sydney, Skye Gyngell was studying at Sydney University when she realised the culinary world was where she wanted to be. She moved to Paris at 19, where she trained and worked under acclaimed chefs including at the two Michelin-starred restaurant Dodin-Bouffant.Gyngell later moved to London and worked at the French House in Soho with Fergus and Margot Henderson.In 2004, Gyngell became head chef at Petersham Nurseries cafe in Richmond, where she  turned the dilapidated site into a thriving cafe, and in 2011, it was awarded a Michelin star.But the kudos was a double-edged sword for Gyngell, who left the cafe a year after the award, saying she was frustrated by customers who expected a traditional Michelin experience at her rustic cafe.Her later ventures included Spring at Somerset House, which was the first single-use plastic-free restaurant in London. Gyngell, who overcame drug and alcohol addiction in her younger years, was also known for her award-winning cookbooks and wrote columns for Vogue as its food editor.Last year, she found a lump in her neck and was diagnosed with Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare and aggressive skin cancer.She underwent an operation which included the removal of her salivary glands, causing her to temporarily lose her sense of smell and taste.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "Music eases surgery and speeds recovery, Indian study finds60 minutes agoSoutik BiswasIndia correspondentBBCA patient with headphones playing music during surgery in a hospital in DelhiUnder the harsh lights of an operating theatre in the Indian capital, Delhi, a woman lies motionless as surgeons prepare to remove her gallbladder.She is under general anaesthesia: unconscious, insensate and rendered completely still by a blend of drugs that induce deep sleep, block memory, blunt pain and temporarily paralyse her muscles.Yet, amid the hum of monitors and the steady rhythm of the surgical team, a gentle stream of flute music plays through the headphones placed over her ears.Even as the drugs silence much of her brain, its auditory pathway remains partly active. When she wakes up, she will regain consciousness more quickly and clearly because she required lower doses of anaesthetic drugs such as propofol and opioid painkillers than patients who heard no music.That, at least, is what a new peer-reviewed study from Delhi's Maulana Azad Medical College suggests. The research, published in the journal Music and Medicine, offers some of the strongest evidence yet that music played during general anaesthesia can modestly but meaningfully reduce drug requirements and improve recovery.The study focuses on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the standard keyhole operation to remove the gallbladder. The procedure is short - usually under an hour - and demands a particularly swift, \"clear-headed\" recovery.To understand why the researchers turned to music, it helps to decode the modern practice of anaesthesia.\"Our aim is early discharge after surgery,\" says Dr Farah Husain, senior specialist in anaesthesia and certified music therapist for the study. \"Patients need to wake up clear-headed, alert and oriented, and ideally pain-free. With better pain management, the stress response is curtailed.\" Achieving that requires a carefully balanced mix of five or six drugs that together keep the patient asleep, block pain, prevent memory of the surgery and relax the muscles.Getty ImagesPatients need to wake up clear-headed and ideally pain-free after surgeryIn procedures like laparoscopic gallbladder removal, anaesthesiologists now often supplement this drug regimen with regional \"blocks\" - ultrasound-guided injections that numb nerves in the abdominal wall. \"General anaesthesia plus blocks is the norm,\" says Dr Tanvi Goel, primary investigator and a former senior resident of Maulana Azad Medical College. \"We've been doing this for decades.\"But the body does not take to surgery easily. Even under anaesthesia, it reacts: heart rate rises, hormones surge, blood pressure spikes. Reducing and managing this cascade is one of the central goals of modern surgical care. Dr Husain explains that the stress response can slow recovery and worsen inflammation, highlighting why careful management is so important.The stress starts even before the first cut, with intubation - the insertion of a breathing tube into the windpipe.To do this, the anaesthesiologist uses a laryngoscope to lift the tongue and soft tissues at the base of the throat, obtain a clear view of the vocal cords, and guide the tube into the trachea. It's a routine step in general anaesthesia that keeps the airway open and allows precise control of the patient's breathing while they are unconscious.\"The laryngoscopy and intubation are considered the most stressful response during general anaesthesia,\" says Dr Sonia Wadhawan, director-professor of anaesthesia and intensive care at Maulana Azad Medical College and supervisor of the study.\"Although the patient is unconscious and will remember nothing, their body still reacts to the stress with changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones.\"To be sure, the drugs have evolved. The old ether masks have vanished. In their place are intravenous agents - most notably propofol, the hypnotic made infamous by Michael Jackson's death but prized in operating theatres for its rapid onset and clean recovery. \"Propofol acts within about 12 seconds,\" notes Dr Goel. \"We prefer it for short surgeries like laparoscopic cholecystectomy because it avoids the 'hangover' caused by inhalational gases.\"The team of researchers wanted to know whether music could reduce how much propofol and fentanyl (an opioid painkiller) patients required. Less drugs means faster awakening, steadier vital signs and reduced side effects.So they designed a study. A pilot involving eight patients led to a full 11-month trial of 56 adults, aged roughly 20 to 45, randomly assigned to two groups. All received the same five-drug regimen: a drug that prevents nausea and vomiting, a sedative, fentanyl, propofol and a muscle relaxant. Both groups wore noise-cancelling headphones - but only one heard music.\"We asked patients to select from two calming instrumental pieces - soft flute or piano,\" says Dr Husain. \"The unconscious mind still has areas that remain active. Even if the music isn't explicitly recalled, implicit awareness can lead to beneficial effects.\"A pilot involving eight patients led to a full trial of 56 adults randomly assigned to two groups The results were striking.Patients exposed to music required lower doses of propofol and fentanyl. They experienced smoother recoveries, lower cortisol or stress-hormone levels and a much better control of blood pressure during the surgery. \"Since the ability to hear remains intact under anaesthesia,\" the researchers write, \"music can still shape the brain's internal state.\"Clearly, music seemed to quieten the internal storm. \"The auditory pathway remains active even when you're unconscious,\" says Dr Wadhawan. \"You may not remember the music, but the brain registers it.\"The idea that the mind behind the anaesthetic veil is not entirely silent has long intrigued scientists. Rare cases of \"intraoperative awareness\" show patients recalling fragments of operating-room conversation. If the brain is capable of picking up and remembering stressful experiences during surgery - even when a patient is unconscious - then it might also be able to register positive or comforting experiences, like music, even without conscious memory.\"We're only beginning to explore how the unconscious mind responds to non-pharmacological interventions like music,\" says Dr Husain. \"It's a way of humanising the operating room.\"Music therapy is not new to medicine; it has long been used in psychiatry, stroke rehabilitation and palliative care. But its entry into the intensely technical, machine-governed world of anaesthesia marks a quiet shift.If such a simple intervention can reduce drug use and speed recovery - even modestly - it could reshape how hospitals think about surgical wellbeing.As the research team prepares its next study exploring music-aided sedation, building on earlier findings, one truth is already humming through the data: even when the body is still and the mind asleep, it appears a few gentle notes can help the healing begin.",

    "body": "1 day agoJane ChambersBusiness reporter, Aguas Calientes, PeruAFP via Getty ImagesMachu Picchu attracts more than 1.6 million tourists per year, but getting there is not easyMachu Picchu, the remains of a 15th Century Inca city, is Peru's most popular tourist destination, and a Unesco world heritage site. Yet a continuing dispute over the buses that take visitors up to the mountain-top site recently saw some 1,400 stranded tourists needing to be evacuated.Cristian Alberto Caballero Chacón is head of operations for bus company Consettur, which for the past 30 years has transported some 4,500 people every day to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas Calientes.It is a 20-minute journey, and the only alternative is an arduous, steep, two-hour walk.He admits that in the past few months \"there have been some conflicts between people from different communities here\".This conflict revolves around Consettur losing its licence to a rival bus firm in this remote part of Peru, where, unless you want to hike over Andes mountains, the only access is by public transport.To get to Machu Picchu without walking, tourists must first take a train to Aguas Calientes, which takes from two to three and a half hours. And then transfer to a bus for the final leg.Wilson ChiloA fleet of buses ferry tourists to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas CalientesBack in September, local protestors angry that Consettur was being replaced following what they saw as an insufficiently open bidding process, blocked the railway line to Aguas Calientes with rocks.This resulted in Peruvian authorities having to clear the tracks and evacuate tourists on special train services.A number of local people, who didn't want to go on the record, say the protestors were unhappy that Consettur had a monopoly on the lucrative bus service, and that its position as sole provider was simply due to be transferred to new company San Antonio de Torontoy. A round-trip bus ticket costs $24 (£18) for a foreigner and $15 for a Peruvian.Although Consettur's licence ran out in September, it is continuing to run its buses. And due to legal challenges, San Antonio de Torontoy has yet to start.It's a complex situation, involving people from different local communities wanting a slice of the bus income, but Mr Caballero is adamant that Consettur is not a monopoly.\"The owners of the business have been running the company for the past 30 years, and they are people who come from around here,\" he says. \"This is not a monopoly. Consettur is made up of 12 different companies with various partners.\"These partners include the local district council, which owns 38% of Consettur.Meanwhile, San Antonio de Torontoy is based slightly further away in the wider Urubamba Province.AFP via Getty ImagesUnless you fancy a long hike, the only way to get to the town of Aguas Calientes is by trainAs the row and legal dispute over the buses rumbles on, Australian tourist Annalise Jaksic complains about the cost of the trains to Aguas Calientes. The cheapest round-trip ticket is $140, rising to $2,000 for luxury first class.Speaking in Aguas Calientes, she says: \"We thought it was one train [all the way to Machu Picchu]. And we thought if there was any more transport to get up there it would all be included, because you pay so much money for the train.\"Her friend and travelling companion Todd Carland adds that buying the entry tickets for the site \"was a nightmare for us\". He says it was difficult to arrange because they weren't doing it through an expensive guided tour. A standard adult price for Machu Picchu is $57.The mayor of Aguas Calientes, Elvis La Torre, is also unhappy about the entry tickets, because he says that most of the revenues do not stay locally.\"Only 10% of the ticket sales stay in the region. The rest of the money goes to the Ministry of Culture to look after other archaeological sites around Peru and pay for wages.\"He wants more money to go to his community and the surrounding region to help improve tourism and fund more projects to help the locals. The Ministry of Culture was asked for a comment.Wilson ChiloCristian Alberto Caballero Chacón says Consettur would welcome the competitionOutside on one of the side streets that are full of stalls offering tourism souvenirs, like fluffy alpacas and scarves, Dina Huillca is sitting on the pavement selling roses, tomatoes and mint. She travels from her village to get here, and says that \"more needs to be done for the local communities\".She adds: \"We don't have basic services like running water, or a hospital, and the schools need to be in better condition.\"Carlos González is president of the chamber of tourism for this region of Peru, the Department of Cusco. He wants to see more state oversight of public transport in Peru.\"We are pushing for an update in the law so that the vice ministry of tourism can take care of all the travel resources in our country,\" he says. \"If we don't have a unified approach to Peru as a destination we can't be competitive in the long term.\"He also wants to change tourists' experiences in Machu Picchu, with more entrances, and separate areas where different types of visitors can gather.\"[Such as] spiritual travellers going and having meditative rituals in one area,\" says Mr Gonzalez. \"And let's not forget the younger crowd who are more inclined to do their Tik Toks and their stories for Instagram.

    "body": "In Ukraine's 'kill-zone', robots are a lifeline to troops trapped on perilous eastern front2 days agoAbdujalil AbdurasulovIn eastern UkraineA robot being sent on a mission by Ukraine's fifth brigade to deliver supplies to troops on the frontline\"The toy is delivered,\" a Ukrainian soldier whispers into the radio.In the dead of night, he and his partner move quickly to roll out their cargo from a van. Speed is crucial as they are within the range of deadly Russian drones.The fifth brigade's new \"toy\" is an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), a robot that provides a lifeline for Ukrainian troops at the front in Pokrovsk and Myrnograd, a strategic hub in eastern Ukraine.Russian forces are relentlessly trying to cut off Ukraine's supply routes in the area.Without fresh food and ammunition, Ukraine's frontline soldiers would face a choice of either surrender or a costly retreat.Kyiv has sent special forces, elite assault units and drone groups to reinforce its troops in and around Pokrovsk, but Russia's grip on routes into the city means going in with armoured vehicles would bring almost certain death.Transporting heavy supplies on foot would be just as dangerous.This is where the robot, also known as a land drone, comes in place of traditional troop deployments.The battle of Pokrovsk will probably go down in history as the first in which unmanned ground vehicles were used on a mass scale, largely to deliver supplies and evacuate wounded.The robot is small enough to squeeze into a bicycle lane and looks like a mini tank without a turret.UGVs are difficult to spot, they are harder to jam than an aerial drone and, most importantly, soldiers can operate them remotely from a safer location.They save soldiers' lives and are the future of the army, according to Ihor, the head of unmanned systems for the 7th Corps of the Ukrainian army.About 90% of all supplies for Pokrovsk frontline are now delivered by UGVs, he says.Meanwhile, Russian forces are trying to capture the city by choking the supply chains and relentlessly launching remote-controlled drones to target anything that moves in what is widely called \"the kill-zone\".This 30km-wide stretch of territory along the frontline is within reach of drones from both sides.Constant aerial reconnaissance means any movement in the kill-zone is quickly detected and attacked, by drones as well as conventional weapons such as artillery, mortar rounds and aerial bombs.It's a situation that military doctor Vitsik and his land drone operator Auditor know only too well. These are their call signs, not their real names.When they tried to evacuate wounded Ukrainian soldiers from Pokrovsk last month they were quickly spotted and had only seconds to rush to a nearby house to escape the buzz of Russian drones.\"One drone after another attacked us,\" Vitsik recalls. \"As soon as the drone hit the ground and exploded, immediately the next one appeared. They also fired from artillery and mortars trying to kill us.\"The walls Vitsik and Auditor hid behind shook with each explosion. The barrage lasted for 59 minutes and they eventually slipped into a neighbouring building and escaped.Inside Pokrovsk the drone threat from above is ever present.\"We run from one bush to another, from one house to another, from one street to another,\" says Vitsik.Vitsik via BBCCombat medic 'Vitsik' was caught up in an almost hour long drone attack in the \"kill-zone\" when attempting to evacuate the woundedThanks to those \"first-person view\" drones, Russian troops are close to cutting off all routes leading to Pokrovsk.They claim to have surrounded the entire area, but Kyiv has repeatedly denied that.The head of Ukraine's HUR intelligence agency, Kyrylo Budanov, has told local media the situation in Pokrovsk is \"extremely difficult\" but Ukraine is \"still holding on there\".And yet moving troops into and around the city is extremely dangerous and Ukrainian forces have tried to limit rotating people in and out due to the high risks.As a result, soldiers remain in frontline positions for weeks, sometimes even months.It has made delivering supplies an even more pressing task, and that means the demand for unmanned ground vehicles is growing.A single unit of the 5th brigade can carry out several logistical missions with UGVs in one day.Each assignment starts in an old, shabby garage and the mission I watch is delivering water, ammunition and fuel to drone pilots.Vitsikkk via BBCPokrovsk is largely deserted but as a key road and rail junction, it is essential for Ukraine to keep the city from Russian controlSupplies are loaded on a land drone called Termit, capable of carrying about 200kg. The operator drives it by remote control into the back of a van which takes it closer to the frontline to preserve its battery.When it is dark, two soldiers jump out of the van and roll out the UGV.One of them informs the control room via radio that the land drone has been offloaded. Within seconds the operator several kilometres away confirms he is connected to the machine and Termit heads off to its destination.Machines like Termit have been used by some Ukrainian brigades since last year but they have become increasingly popular in recent months.At a workshop for the 79th brigade, engineers who previously made only aerial remote-controlled drones are now tasked with upgrading unmanned ground vehicles for use in combat zones.They apply camouflage, weld new platforms and add hardware for extra communication. But even with these improvements, UGVs are still vulnerable to drone attacks.Engineers are increasingly tasked to make the land drones combat zone ready adding camouflage and extra communication links \"No matter how well it is concealed, no matter what connection you use and how quickly it moves\", the machine can still be detected and destroyed, says a UGV operator with the call sign \"Lawyer\".During one mission to evacuate a wounded soldier from Pokrovsk, his unmanned vehicle hit a landmine damaging its tracks.Another land drone was sent on a rescue mission from a different unit, but it was destroyed too. Lawyer still does not know if the wounded soldier made it out alive.On average just one out of three UGVs manages to reach the city, says Ihor, from the unmanned systems department of the 7th Corps. While the majority of the small robots won't make it, the troops on the frontline are reliant on those that do.",

    "body": "15 hours agoGeeta PandeyDelhiDinodiaDharmendra often said he was 'embarrassed' by talk about his looksBollywood star Dharmendra has died in the Indian city of Mumbai at the age of 89.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to the actor, saying his passing \"marks the end of an era in Indian cinema\".Dharmendra, who often described himself as \"a simple man\", commanded extraordinary affection and loyalty from his tens of millions of fans.Best known as Veeru, the lovable petty criminal in the 1975 blockbuster Sholay, he appeared in over 300 films, many hits, captivating audiences for decades.Songs featuring him topped the charts, and his romance and marriage with Hema Malini made headlines.Dubbed the \"original He-Man of Bollywood\" and \"Garam (hot) Dharam\", the actor often made it to global lists of \"most handsome men\" in his heyday and female fans were known to sleep with his photographs under their pillows.Bollywood stars weren't immune to his charms either - over the years actress Madhuri Dixit described him as \"one of the most handsome people I have seen on screen\", superstar Salman Khan said Dharmendra was the \"most beautiful looking man\" and actress Jaya Bachchan called him \"a Greek God\".Dharmendra always said he was \"embarrassed\" by talk of his good looks and attributed it to \"nature, my parents and my genes\".Watch: Popular Indian actor Dharmendra receives lifetime achievement awardsBorn on 8 December 1935 in Nasrali village in Punjab's Ludhiana district in a middle-class Jatt-Sikh family, he was named Dharam Singh Deol by his schoolteacher father.In a 2018 interview with BBC Hindi, he said his father wanted him to study, but he fell in love with films early on and wanted to be a hero.\"I watched my first film when I was in the ninth standard and I was hooked. I was wondering, where is this heaven where all these beautiful people live? I thought I must find my way there. I felt like they were mine and I belonged to them.\"But when he told his family, they were appalled.DinodiaDharmendra (right) with Amjad Khan in Sholay\"My mother said, 'you are our eldest child, you have family responsibilities'. I was very sad. So when we heard about the All India Talent Contest by Filmfare magazine, to humour me, she said, 'ok, send in your application'. We didn't think I would be selected.\"But then he won the contest and moved to Bombay (now Mumbai) and the rest, as they say, is history.For three decades - after debuting with Dil Bhi Tera, Hum Bhi Tere (The heart is yours and so am I) in 1960 - he ruled Bollywood, delivering several hits a year.Dharmendra first rose to fame with Bimal Roy's 1963 film Bandini, earning praise for his elegant portrayal of a prison doctor who falls for a convict.He soon became a romantic hero, pairing successfully with top actresses like Nutan, Meena Kumari, Mala Sinha, and Saira Banu.In 1966, he did his first action role in Phool Aur Patthar (Flower and rock), but it was the 1971 hit Mera Gaon Mera Desh (My village, my country) which cemented his reputation as an action hero.Tall and well-built, Dharmendra often did his own action scenes, involving daring stunts, even taking risks.Besides romance and action, the actor also delivered thrillers and comedies that were hits. Critics praised him \"for his impeccable comic timing\" in the hilarious 1975 film Chupke Chupke.DinodiaDharmendra with wife Bollywood actor Hema MaliniOver the years, Dharmendra said he was cast against 70 heroines, but his most successful screen pairing was with Hema Malini, who later became his second wife.The couple first met at a film premiere in 1965 and Hema Malini made an immediate impression on Dharmendra. In her 2017 biography, she wrote that she heard Dharmendra telling fellow actor Shashi Kapoor in Punjabi, \"Kudi badi changi hai (The girl is quite pretty)\".Their romance bloomed in the 1970s through superhit films like Seeta Aur Geeta, Raja Jani, and Sholay, making headlines as Dharmendra was already married with grown-up children with his first wife, Prakash Kaur.The media wrote about the resistance from Hema Malini's family to their wedding, but the couple finally tied the knot in 1980. Some reports said they had converted to Islam, which allows polygamy, to marry - a claim Dharmendra later denied.The actor-producer also dabbled in politics. He was the BJP MP from Bikaner in Rajasthan for one term from 2005 to 2009. But he was criticised for not taking politics seriously as he rarely attended parliament, preferring to spend time shooting for films or working on his farm.Speaking to a television programme, Aap Ki Adalat, years later, he agreed that he was a misfit in politics. \"Politics is not for emotional people, it's for the thick-skinned,\" he said. \"These five years were very tough for me, they were difficult.\"He worked almost to the end of his life, acting alongside his sons Sunny and Bobby Deol, judging reality shows, and connecting with fans via social media.AFP via Getty ImagesDharmendra with sons Sunny (right) and Bobby Deol (left) at his Mumbai residenceIn his lifetime, the actor gave many fine performances, but if there's one role that he'll always be remembered for, it'll be that of Veeru in Sholay - the 1975 blockbuster that has become a cultural phenomenon.The multi-starrer that also had Amitabh Bachchan, Hema Malini and Jaya Bachchan in the lead roles saw Dharmendra and Bachchan play loveable rogues-turned-saviours who are recruited to fight a dreaded bandit.The film became a cult classic and many fans credited Dharmendra for its success, describing him as the \"soul of Sholay\". The actor also described it as his finest role. \"I don't think I have ever done a better role than Veeru's,\" he said.The young girl who became Bollywood's pen-palBut despite delivering dozens of hits, Dharmendra never made it to the \"number one\" slot in Bollywood - losing to contemporaries such as Dilip Kumar, Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan - and was passed for the prestigious Filmfare awards several times.It was finally in 1997 that Filmfare honoured him with the Lifetime Achievement Award for his contribution to Hindi cinema and in 2012, he was conferred the Padma Bhushan - an Indian government honour given to civilians for distinguished service.But Dharmendra wore his stardom lightly, staying away from the rat race and said he never wanted to be number one in the industry.\"I never asked for too much money, and fame is transient. All I ever wanted was people's love,\" he told an interviewer.\"I came here just for this love. Everyone loves Dharmendra and I am grateful for that,\" he added.On Wednesday, news of his death prompted tributes from the film fraternity on social media.\"Growing up, Dharmendra was the hero every boy wanted to be,\" said actor Akshay Kumar. \"Thank you for inspiring generations. You'll live on through your films and the love you spread.\"Describing his passing as the \"end of an era\", director Karan Johar said it had left \"a gaping hole in the industry... a space that can never be filled by anyone... there will always be one and only Dharmendra\".",

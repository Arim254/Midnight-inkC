    "body": "Five people have been charged in connection with the 2023 overdose death of Robert De Niro's grandson and two other 19 year olds. New York authorities accuse the suspects, Bruce Epperson, Eddie Barreto, Grant McIver, John Nicolas, and Roy Nicolas, of running a fentanyl distribution network that sold counterfeit prescription opioid pills through social media to teenagers and young adults in the city. Authorities link the network to the overdose deaths of Leandro De Niro-Rodriguez,  Akira Stein - daughter of Blondie co-founder Chris Stein - and a third unnamed victim.The five are each charged with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute.\"Through their alleged actions, these defendants left behind a trail of irreversible loss that cut short the lives of three teenagers who held boundless potential and who had already made profound, immeasurable impacts on those who knew them,\" said Homeland Security Investigations New York special agent in charge Ricky Patel in a statement on Thursday. Prosecutors allege the five used social media and encrypted messaging apps to sell thousands fentanyl-laced pills in New York between January and July 2023.They allege that over that summer, the drugs they sold led to at least three deaths. Stein was found dead 30 May after taking fentanyl-laced pills she allegedly  purchased from John and Roy Nicolas. The unnamed victim, who died 13 June, allegedly purchased pills through an intermediary from Mr McIver.Authorities say De Niro-Rodriguez, who died 2 July, got pills from a dealer who allegedly obtained them from Mr McIver, Mr Epperson, and Mr Barreto.Separatedly in 2023, a woman was arrested for allegedly selling De Niro-Rodriguez three counterfeit oxycodone pills containing fentanyl - the drugs believed to have led to his death - and tablets of Xanax.In a statement after the death of his grandson, Academy-Award winner De Niro said he was \"deeply distressed\" by the passing of his \"beloved grandson\", who was the only child of his daughter Drena.In a statement on Instagram on Thursday, Chris Stein noted the arrests in his daughter's case and thanked officials \"for this hope of some justice for her\".If found guilty, the charges carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life in prison, officials said.

    "body": "14 hours agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondentThe commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces has warned Russian activity is increasing around the key frontline town of Pokrovsk, saying \"the situation is difficult\".General Oleksandr Syrskyi admitted Russian infantry was massing in the area and said he had visited the frontline himself for talks with key commanders.But he said reports that Ukrainian troops had been \"blockaded\" there by Russian forces was \"untrue\" propaganda.There have been growing reports of Russian advances around the strategic town in the Donetsk region in the east of Ukraine. It forms a key transport and supply hub and its capture could unlock Russian efforts to seize the rest of the region.In a statement on Telegram, General Syrskyi said: \"In Pokrovsk, enemy infantry, avoiding combat, is amassing in the urban area and changing locations, so the primary objective is to identify and destroy them.\"He added: \"The situation is difficult, but Russian propaganda claims about the alleged 'blockade' of the Ukrainian Defence Forces in Pokrovsk, as well as in Kupiansk, are untrue.\"He said commanders were having to maintain \"a reasonable balance between goals and capabilities.\"\"The main priority is preserving the lives of our soldiers,\" he added.Russian forces have been trying to seize Pokrovsk for more than a year. Taking it would give them a path towards taking the two biggest cities still controlled by Ukraine in the region - Kramatorsk and Sloviansk.Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Russia's chief of general staff, Gen Valery Gerasimov, claimed earlier this week Ukrainian troops in Pokrovsk had been surrounded.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Pokrovsk was \"the main target\" for Russia whose forces there, he said, outnumbered Ukrainians by eight to one.He told reporters Russia wanted to take the town to convince the United States that Ukraine was on the run.\"They do not have a result they can 'sell' to the Americans. We understand why they need Pokrovsk. They need it only to claim that Ukraine withdraws from the east and gives everything else they want,\" Zelensky said.In its latest assessment, the defence intelligence firm, Sybelline, said the battle for Pokrovsk \"has entered a highly dynamic and intense phase, as the Russian forces intensify their efforts to infiltrate the city and encircle Ukrainian defenders\".Deepstate, a Ukrainian monitoring group, said Russian forces were \"gradually engulfing\" Pokrovsk \"with [their] sheer number of personnel\". It said Russian troops were infiltrating deeper into the town and disrupting Ukrainian supply routes. \"The situation in Pokrovsk is on the brink of crisis and continues to deteriorate, to the point where it may be too late to fix everything,\" the group concluded.",

    "body": "The Sagrada Família has become the tallest church in the world, after workers placed the first part of a cross at the top of its central tower. Now measuring 162.91 metres tall, the Spanish basilica has officially pipped the record from the Ulm Minster in Germany, which has held the crown since 1890.Designed by acclaimed architect Antoni Gaudí, the place of worship has been under construction in the centre of Barcelona for more than a century, with the main building due to be completed next year. The central Tower of Jesus Christ will grow with the addition of the rest of the cross over the next few months, eventually standing at 172 metres tall. The first stone of the Sagrada Família was placed in 1882, with up-and-coming architect Gaudí taking over the project the following year. He transformed the original designs for the basilica into a far more ambitious proposal, which was initially funded by donations from repentant worshippers. At the time of his unexpected death in 1926, just one of the planned 18 towers had been built.In the years following, the construction of the architectural marvel was managed by the Sagrada Família foundation, and funded by contributions from tourists, visitors and private donors.In addition to the death of its primary architect, the basilica has hit a number of roadblocks throughout its almost 150-year construction. During the Spanish Civil War, Catalan anarchists set fire to the crypt, destroying plans and plaster models created by Gaudí that would guide future construction.Most recently, the Covid-19 pandemic saw construction on the building halted, with members of the foundation attributing the pause to a lack of tourism, and the subsequent drop in funding for the project.In September this year, Sagrada Família General Director Xavier Martínez told the Associated Press that the Tower of Jesus Christ would be completed in 2026, to coincide with the centenary of Gaudí's death.The foundation will hold a series of events to commemorate the architect, who is buried in the church's crypt.Work on decorative details, sculptures and a stairway leading to the building's main entrance is expected to continue over the next decade.",

    "body": "US space agency Nasa has rejected reality star Kim Kardashian's claim that the 1969 space mission to land the first man on the Moon was faked.\"Yes, we've been to the Moon before... 6 times!\" Nasa acting administrator Sean Duffy wrote on social media.Kardashian made the comments on the latest episode of her long-running TV series The Kardashians, telling co-star Sarah Paulson she thought the Moon landing \"didn't happen\".Despite being consistently debunked, conspiracy theories as to whether humans actually reached the Moon have persisted for more than 50 years, particularly with the rise of social media. In the episode, Kardashian can be seen showing Paulson an interview with astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who along with Neil Armstrong took the first steps on the lunar surface during the Apollo 11 mission.\"I'm sending you a million articles with both Buzz Aldrin and the other one,\" Kardashian says, before reading a quote allegedly from Aldrin responding to a question about the scariest moment of the expedition.\"There was no scary moment because it didn't happen. It could've been scary, but it wasn't because it didn't happen,\" she reads.It is unclear which article Kardashian was reading from, or if the quotes were actually from Aldrin.Moments later, the reality star is seen telling a producer \"I centre conspiracies all the time\", adding that she believes the Moon landing was fake.\"I think it was fake. I've seen a few videos on Buzz Aldrin talking about how it didn't happen. He says it all the time now, in interviews. Maybe we should find Buzz Aldrin,\" she says.Following the broadcast, Duffy tagged Kardashian in a post on X, rebuffing her comments, and promoted Nasa's current moon exploration program Artemis, which is \"going back under the leadership\" of Donald Trump.\"We won the last space race and we will win this one too,\" he added.In response, Kardashian wrote back asking about the interstellar object named 3I/Atlas, which astronomers said could be the oldest comet ever seen.\"Wait…. what's the tea on 3I Atlas?!?!!!!!!!?????\" she replied.Duffy later invited Kardashian to the Kennedy Space Center for the launch of the Artemis mission to the moon.For  decades, scientists and experts have rebutted conspiracy theories claiming the Apollo 11 mission was a hoax.\"Every single argument claiming that Nasa faked the Moon landings has been discredited,\" according to the Institute of Physics.",

    "description": "On Wednesday, over tea and cakes with veterans of the Ukraine war, President Vladimir Putin announced Russia had tested a new weapon.\"There is nothing",
    "body": "On Wednesday, over tea and cakes with veterans of the Ukraine war, President Vladimir Putin announced Russia had tested a new weapon.\"There is nothing like this,\" the Russian leader said of the Poseidon - a nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable underwater drone that can be fired like a torpedo and which a senior Russian MP said could \"put entire states out of operation\". When it was first unveiled in 2018, Russian media said the Poseidon would be able to achieve a speed of 200km/h (120mph) and travel in a \"constantly changing route\" that would make it impossible to intercept.Putin's claim came only days after the announcement that Moscow had conducted a test of its \"unlimited-range\" Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile. It's \"a unique product, unmatched in the world\", Putin said of the Burevestnik, noting the missile was so new \"we are yet to identify what it is, what class of weapons [it] belongs to\".It is not unusual for Russia to test and flaunt weapons.And, despite the boisterous nature of Russian announcements, their military value is ambiguous.\"They are basically Armageddon weapons - too powerful to be used unless you're happy to destroy the world,\" Mark Galeotti, a Russia scholar and long-time observer of Russian politics, told the BBC.Both the Poseidon and the Burevestnik are second-strike, retaliatory weapons, Mr Galeotti added - and not even the most rabid Kremlin propagandists are suggesting anyone is preparing to launch strikes on Russia. It is also unclear whether the weapons are actually viable. In 2019, five Russian nuclear engineers died in a rocket engine explosion which some Russian and Western experts said was linked to the Burevestnik.Two years later, the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) - a London-based think tank specialising in global conflict and security - noted that Russia faced \"considerable technical challenges\" in ensuring \"the reliable performance of the nuclear-propulsion unit\" of the missile.Neither the Poseidon nor the Burevestnik were entirely novel - both had first been presented to the world in 2018 as part of a new array of weapons that Putin called \"invincible\".So it is the timing of the announcements - rather than their contents - which could be noteworthy. After a whirlwind few months of tentative diplomacy by US President Donald Trump to try and bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table, Trump appears to have cooled off on the endeavour to end the war. Last week, the White House cancelled a summit between Trump and Putin, apparently after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio realised the gulf between Moscow and Washington's positions was too great for a high-level meeting to achieve meaningful results.Not only is there no suggestion of any further talks, but soon after the meeting was cancelled, Trump imposed sanctions on two of Russia's biggest oil producers as punishment for Moscow's failure to agree on a peace deal in Ukraine.And while his relationship with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky seems to still be fraught, it appears Trump is growing irritated with Moscow's intractability.So Putin may be vying for Trump's attention. \"In the face of Trump blowing hot and cold with his support for Ukraine or sympathy to Russia, here is an element in which Moscow has bigger cards than Kyiv,\" Mr Galeotti argued. \"So in that context [successful weapons tests] are more about keeping him thinking Russia is indeed powerful.\"Another clue could come from the battlefield in Ukraine. Three-and-a-half years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour, its troops continue to merely grind on - at great cost in human life and resources - with no obvious breakthrough likely any time soon.\"We are getting towards the end of summer fighting season in Ukraine and it has not gone very well for the Russians,\" said David Heathcote, head of intelligence at McKenzie Intelligence Services.The announcements about the Burevestnik and the Poseidon should be seen as a reflection of the weakness of their conventional forces, Mr Heathcote told the BBC. Russia is not formally part of any military alliances that would serve as a deterrent if it is on the back foot, and its army is tied up and under pressure in Ukraine. In these cases, Mr Heathcote says, \"the Russians always react with unnecessary and overexaggerated sabre rattling\".While Moscow's decision to publicly announce the Burevestnik and Poseidon tests may have been influenced by this, it seems the claim has already had the tangible effect of provoking Trump into instructing its military to resume nuclear weapons testing.Trump justified the move as a way of keeping pace with other countries such as Russia and China. \"With others doing testing, I think it's appropriate that we do also,\" Trump said - although it will likely take several months for the US to restart nuclear tests after a 33-year pause.The Kremlin's reaction to Trump's statement was quickPutin spokesman Dmitry Peskov questioned whether the US president had been correctly informed. The Russian tests \"cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test\", Peskov said. Trump did not elaborate on the kind of tests he wanted the US to resume.It was likely, said Christopher Egerton of the Institute for Strategic Studies (IIS), that Trump's decision was a direct response to the Russian test of the Burevestnik and that the US could be planning to conduct similar flight tests of US Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles.

    "body": "10 hours agoDanielle KayeBusiness reporterReutersApple boss Tim Cook holds an iPhone 17 pro and an iPhone Air, as Apple holds an event at the Steve Jobs Theater on its campus in Cupertino, California, US September 9, 2025.The latest iPhones have seen \"a tremendous response\" across the globe, said Apple boss Tim Cook as the tech giant released its latest financial results.The firm unveiled its thinnest iPhone, the Air, in September, along with upgraded iPhone 17 models, proving a bumper crop for the firm.It said it expects the upcoming Christmas and New Year's period to be a blockbuster, forecasting overall revenue to be up to 12% higher than the same period last year.But Apple narrowly missed estimates for iPhone sales in its fourth quarter that ended in September, which boss Tim Cook blamed on supply constraints for several iPhone models along with a lag in shipments to China.Despite that, during a call with analysts Mr Cook said Apple is heading into the holiday season \"with our most powerful lineup ever\".The iPhone Air helped entice customers and boost sales.If the company meets its sales forecast for the holiday season, it would be Apple's \"best quarter ever\", chief financial officer Kevan Parekh told analysts on Thursday.Apple reported overall fourth quarter revenue of $102.5bn (£77bn), topping analysts' estimates and representing an 8% increase from the previous year. But iPhone revenue, specifically, came in slightly below expectations at $49bn (£37bn).Mr Cook stressed that global demand for iPhone 16 and 17 models has been robust, despite constraints that led to the sales miss in the recent quarter. \"We're not predicting when the supply and demand will balance,\" Mr Cook said. \"We're obviously working very hard to achieve that, because we want to get as many of these products out to customers as possible.\"In the Chinese market, he said he \"couldn't be more pleased with how things are going\", citing strong reception to the new iPhone 17.Data from Counterpoint, a technology market research firm, showed that the first 10 days of iPhone 17 sales in the US and China were up 14% compared with sales of the iPhone 16.The effects of US President Donald Trump's tariffs also remain top of mind for Apple's investors. It manufactures many iPhones in China and its global supply chain leaves it vulnerable to trade wars - though a recent meeting between Trump and President Xi raised hopes for a de-escalation of tensions.Mr Cook on Thursday told analysts that the company took at $1.1bn (£836m) hit from tariffs in the recently ended quarter. He said the hit will likely amount to another $1.4bn in the holiday quarter as Trump imposes taxes on those whom he sees as \"unfavourable\" to the US economy.Amazon, which also reported quarterly results on Thursday, projected sales to land between $206bn (£156bn) and $213bn (£161bn) for the current quarter through December, largely in line with analysts' expectations.\"We're encouraged by the start of the peak season,\" Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, told analysts.Amazon also said that revenue from Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing business, rose 20% in the third quarter from the previous year - its fastest pace since 2022.For investors, that AI-driven growth could come as a reassurance, as Apple faces fierce competition in the race to dominate the AI boom.Apple's stock has lagged behind that of rivals Microsoft and Alphabet, both of whom on Wednesday reaffirmed their commitment to spending big on the technology. Those firms have reported even faster growth than Amazon in their cloud computing businesses.\"We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure, and we've been focused on accelerating capacity,\" Andy Jassy, Amazon's chief executive, said in a statement.",

    "body": "53 minutes agoPumza Fihlani,BBC Africa, Johannesburg and Wycliffe MuiaA South African court has ruled that Nobel laureate Albert Luthuli's 1967 death was the result of an \"assault\" by apartheid police, overturning decades of claims that it was an accident.An inquest held under the apartheid government concluded that Luthuli, the first African to win the Nobel Peace Prize, died after being struck by a freight train while walking along a railway line.But activists and his family had long cast doubt on the findings, and South Africa's government reopened the case this year. A judge on Thursday ruled that the anti-apartheid hero died as a result of a fractured skull and a cerebral haemorrhage associated with an assault. His family has welcomed the judgement.Luthuli, who at the time of his death was the leader of the then-banned African National Congress (ANC), won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1960 for spearheading the fight against apartheid.Ghosts of apartheid haunt South Africa as compensation anger brewsSouth Africa's long wait for justice over apartheid crimesThe ANC went on to lead the struggle against white-minority rule and came to power in 1994, following the first democratic elections.South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority in April reopened fresh investigations into Luthuli's death as family and activists suspected the apartheid authorities had killed him and covered it up. Delivering the judgment on Thursday, Judge Nompumelelo Radebe said evidence presented at the reopened inquest did not support the 1967 inquest findings. \"It is found that the deceased died as a result of a fractured skull, cerebral haemorrhage and concussion of the brain associated with an assault,\" Judge Nompumelelo ruled.The judge said Luthuli's death was attributable to \"assault by members of the security special branch of the South African police, acting in concert and in common purpose with employees of the South African Railway Company\".She named seven men, whose whereabouts could \"not be ascertained\", as having committed or being complicit in the murder. If found, they could face criminal charges. After the judgment was read out, the Luthuli family's spokesperson called it \"the first part of finally getting justice\".ANC national spokesperson Mahlengi Bhengu also welcomed the court's decision, which she said \"corrected a long-standing distortion of history\".\"This ruling brings justice, truth and dignity to the memory of one of South Africa's greatest sons and to all those who suffered under apartheid brutality,\" Bhengu added. The case at the Pietermaritzburg High Court is the latest in renewed efforts by South African authorities to deliver justice for victims of apartheid-era crimes and closure for their families.Last month, South Africa prosecutors reopened the inquest into the death of anti-apartheid leader Steve Biko, who died in police custody in 1977 after being tortured.In May, President Cyril Ramaphosa established a judicial commission of inquiry to look into allegations of improper influence in delaying or hindering the investigation and prosecution of apartheid-era crimes.",

    "body": "9 minutes agoDavid GrittenJerusalemIsraeli prime minister's officeIsraeli soldiers salute the coffins, which were handed over by Hamas via the Red Cross in GazaIsrael has confirmed the identities of two deceased hostages whose bodies it received from Hamas via the Red Cross in Gaza on Thursday.Forensic tests showed the remains were those of Amiram Cooper, 84, and Sahar Baruch, 25, the Israeli prime minister's office said.\"The government of Israel shares in the deep sorrow of the Cooper and [Baruch] families and all the families of the fallen hostages,\" it said in a statement.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel demanded that all 11 Israeli and foreign deceased hostages still in Gaza be returned immediately by Hamas in line with the US-brokered ceasefire agreement.Amiram Cooper was abducted along with his wife, Nurit, from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, which sparked the war. Hamas released Nurit after 17 days, but it continued to hold Amiram.The Israeli military said it estimated Amiram was murdered in captivity in February 2024, but that final conclusions will be made upon completion of a post-mortem.It had previously said he was killed along with three other hostages - Nadav Popplewell, Chaim Peri and Yoram Metzger - in Khan Younis while troops were operating in the area. Hamas had claimed they were killed by an Israeli strike.Sahar Baruch was kidnapped during the attack on Kibbutz Be'eri by Hamas gunmen, who also killed his brother, Edan, and grandmother, Geula Bachar.The Israeli military said it estimated that he was murdered in captivity on 8 December 2023, and that it was awaiting the results of a post-mortem.It had previously announced that he was killed during a rescue attempt by Israeli forces.The military expressed its deep condolences to the two men's families and stressed that Hamas was \"required to fulfil its part of the agreement and make the necessary efforts to return all the hostages to their families and to a dignified burial\".The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents many hostages' families, said: \"There are no words to express the depth of this pain.\"\"The hostages have no time. We must bring them all home, now!\"EPAOn Tuesday, Hamas fighters removed a body bag from a tunnel in the southern Gaza city of Khan YounisOn Tuesday, the Israeli government accused Hamas of violating the Gaza ceasefire deal after the group handed over a coffin containing human remains that did not belong to one of the 13 deceased Israeli and foreign hostages then still in Gaza.It said forensic tests showed they belonged to Ofir Tzarfati, a hostage whose body had been recovered by Israeli forces in Gaza in late 2023.The Israeli military also released footage filmed by a drone that showed Hamas members removing a body bag containing the remains from a building in Gaza City, reburying it, and then staging the discovery in front of Red Cross staff.The Red Cross said its staff were unaware that the body bag had been moved before their arrival and that the staged recovery was \"unacceptable\".Hamas rejected what it called the \"baseless allegations\" and accused Israel of \"seeking to fabricate false pretexts in preparation for taking new aggressive steps\".Hours later, the Israeli government accused Hamas of another ceasefire violation, saying the group's fighters had killed an Israeli soldier in an attack in an area of southern Gaza.Hamas claimed it was not involved in the incident in the Rafah area, but Israel's prime minister ordered a wave of air strikes across Gaza on Tuesday night in response. The Israeli military said it attacked \"dozens of terror targets and terrorists\".Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said 104 Palestinians were killed, including 46 children and 20 women, making it the deadliest day since the ceasefire took effect on 10 October.US President Donald Trump maintained \"nothing\" would jeopardise the ceasefire agreement, which his administration brokered along with Qatar, Egypt and Turkey, but he added that Israel should \"hit back\" when its soldiers were targeted.Under the deal, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was holding within 72 hours.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has so far handed over the bodies of 195 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 15 Israeli hostages so far returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Nine of the 11 dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, in which more than 68,600 people have been killed, including more than 200 since the ceasefire took effect, according to the territory's health ministry.",

    "body": "21 minutes agoWill Grant,BBC's Mexico, Central America and Cuba correspondent, Kingston and Brandon DrenonAt least 19 people have died in Jamaica as a result of Hurricane Melissa, Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon has said, as search and rescue efforts continue and authorities try to get aid to hard-hit areas.The hurricane, one of the most powerful to strike the Caribbean, has also killed at least 30 people in Haiti, officials said.In Jamaica, \"there are entire communities that seem to be marooned and areas that seem to be flattened,\" Dixon said, adding there are \"devastating\" scenes in western regions.Electricity remains out to most of the island and as people try to salvage damaged homes and belongings from floodwaters and mud, many thousands are growing increasingly desperate for aid.There are parts of the country that have been without water for several days and food is growing increasingly scarce.Aid supplies are starting to arrive more rapidly with the main airport in the Jamaican capital, Kingston, largely back to normal. But smaller regional airports, some of which are located near to where humanitarian assistance is most needed, remain only partly operational.As such, aid agencies and the military are bringing in the urgently needed supplies from Kingston via road, many of which remain unpassable in places.Satellite imagery shows nearly all buildings in some Jamaican villages have been destroyed by the hurricane. Residents of towns in western Jamaica told the BBC on Thursday that \"words can't explain how devastating\" the storm has been on the country.\"No one is able to get through to their loved ones,\" Trevor 'Zyanigh' Whyte told the BBC from the town of White House in Westmoreland parish. \"Everyone is just, you know, completely disconnected... Every tree is on the road, right, so you can't get too far with the cars, not even a bicycle,\" he said.In Haiti, many of the victims in the storm died when a river overflowed in Petit-Goave. A full assessment is ongoing, as there are still areas that authorities have not been able to access.Around 15,000 people were staying in more than 120 shelters in Haiti, interim UN co-ordinator for the country Gregoire Goodstein said.In Cuba, more than 3 million people were \"exposed to life-threatening conditions\" during the hurricane, with 735,000 people \"safely evacuated\", according to the UN's resident co-ordinator for Cuba Francisco Pichon.No fatalities have been reported so far in Cuba, but almost 240 communities have been cut off due to flooding and landslides, Cuban authorities said.Hurricane Melissa made landfall on Tuesday in Jamaica as a category five storm, packing winds of up to 185 mph (295 km/h), before impacting other countries in the Caribbean.Governments, humanitarian organisations and individuals around the world are pledging support for the nations hardest hit by the storm.The World Food Programme said it is collaborating with partners to coordinate logistics, cash and emergency supplies across Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.The US State Department said it is deploying a disaster response team to the region to help with search and rescue operations, and assisting in efforts to provide food, water, medical supplies, hygiene kits and temporary shelters.The UK government on Friday said it is mobilising an additional £5m ($6m) to send humanitarian supplies, including shelter kits and solar powered lanterns, to help people without power and whose homes have been damaged.That is on top of £2.5m ($3.36m) already announced in emergency humanitarian funding to support recovery in the Caribbean.The Foreign Office is also preparing flights to evacuate British nationals unable to come home on commercial flights.While Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti assessed the damage left in Melissa's wake, Bermuda braced for impact.The Bermuda Weather Service expected Melissa to be a category two hurricane when it passed the British overseas territory on Thursday night.Government offices in Bermuda will close until Friday afternoon and all schools will shut on Friday.\"Until the official 'All Clear' is issued, residents are urged to stay off the roads so Government work crews can safely assess and clear debris,\" a public alert from the government said.",

    "body": "Trump caps refugee admissions at record low - with most to be white South Africans6 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseThe Trump administration will limit the number of refugees admitted to the US to 7,500 over the next year, and give priority to white South Africans.The move, announced in a notice published on Thursday, marks a dramatic cut from the previous limit of 125,000 set by former President Joe Biden and will bring the cap to a record low.No reason was given for the cut, but the notice said it was \"justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest\".In January, Trump signed an executive order suspending the US Refugee Admissions Programme, or USRAP, which he said would allow US authorities to prioritise national security and public safety. The previous lowest refugee admissions cap was set by the first Trump administration in 2020, when it allocated 15,000 spots for fiscal year 2021.The notice posted to the website of the Federal Register said the 7,500 admissions would \"primarily\" be allocated to Afrikaner South Africans and \"other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands\".In February, the US president announced the suspension of critical aid to South Africa and offered to allow members of the Afrikaner community - who are mostly white descendants of early Dutch and French settlers - to settle in the US as refugees.South Africa's ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool, was later expelled after accusing Trump of \"mobilising a supremacism\" and trying to \"project white victimhood as a dog whistle\".In the Oval Office in May, Trump confronted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa and claimed white farmers in his nation were being killed and \"persecuted\".The White House also played a video which they said showed burial sites for murdered white farmers. It later emerged that the videos were scenes from a 2020 protest in which the crosses represented farmers killed over multiple years. The tense meeting came just days after the US granted asylum to 60 Afrikaners.The South African government has vehemently denied that Afrikaners and other White South Africans are being persecuted.Watch: 'Turn the lights down' - how the Trump-Ramaphosa meeting took an unexpected turnOn his first day in office on 20 January, Trump said the US would suspend USRAP to reflect the US's lack of \"ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans\" and \"protects their safety and security\".The US policy of accepting white South Africans has already prompted accusations of unfair treatment from refugee advocacy groups. Do Afrikaners want to take Trump up on his South African refugee offer?'I didn't come here for fun' - Afrikaner defends refugee status in USIs there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?Some have argued the US is now effectively shut to other persecuted groups or people facing potential harm in their home country, and even former allies that helped US forces in Afghanistan or the Middle East. \"This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling,\" Global Refuge CEO and president Krish O'Mara Vignarajah said on Thursday. \"It lowers our moral standing.\" \"At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the programme's purpose as well as its credibility,\" she added. Refugees International also slammed the move, saying it \"makes a mockery of refugee protection and of American values\".\"Let us be frank: whatever hardships some Afrikaners may face, this population has no plausible claim on refugee status – they are not fleeing systematic persecution,\" Refugees International said in its statement.The South African government has yet to respond to the latest announcement. During the Oval Office meeting, President Ramaphosa said only that he hoped that Trump officials would listen to South Africans about the issue, and later said he believed there is \"doubt and disbelief about all this in [Trump's] head\".Earlier this year, Ramaphosa signed a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately-owned land without compensation in some circumstances. While the country does not release race-based crime figured, figures published earlier this year showed that 7,000 people were murdered in South African between October and December 2024. Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks and only one of the 12 was a farmer. Five others were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black. ",

    "body": "17 hours agoAna FaguyGetty ImagesThe US government shutdown has entered its fifth week and there is no clear end in sight.With Democrats and Republicans deadlocked over passing a spending plan that would reopen federal agencies, millions of Americans are feeling economic pain that could soon grow worse.The fiscal fight means millions of Americans may not receive food aid, thousands of troops could have to work without pay, and millions may go without heat.Here’s how the shutdown has affected everyday people.Food assistanceMore than 40 million Americans use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) to feed themselves and their families.While that programme had enough funding to survive the first four weeks of the shutdown, the Trump administration has said the money will run out on 1 November. By Saturday, Snap benefits, also called food stamps, could lapse for the first time in the programme's history.Snap is a critical lifeline that keeps families out of poverty, Hannah Garth, a Princeton University professor who studies food insecurity, told the BBC. Groups that provide food for people in need are already under strain and the loss of Snap will make the situation worse, she added.On Thursday, New York Governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency so the state could “help the three million New Yorkers losing food assistance” because of the shutdown. People enrolled in Snap have been stockpiling food and visiting aid organisations, as they wait for the impasse to lift on Capitol Hill.Half the states and the District of Columbia have sued President Donald Trump's administration over the food aid freeze.  The administration, in turn, has blamed Democrats for the funding running dry and said it will only draw from a Snap contingency fund in an emergency such as a natural disaster.The federal government distributes Snap benefits through programmes run by the states. Some states, such as Virginia, have said they will be able to make up for any lack of funds in November, but others like Massachusetts have said they can't cover the shortfall.Military payIf the Trump administration does not intervene, more than a million members of the US military will miss their paycheques on Friday. About a quarter of military families are considered food insecure, and 15% rely on Snap or food pantries, according to the research firm Rand. Meanwhile, the Military Family Advisory Network estimates that 27% of families have $500 (£380) or less in emergency savings.The Pentagon says it has accepted a $130m gift from a wealthy donor to help pay  salaries during the shutdown, but that only works out to $100 for each of the 1.3 million active-duty service members expecting to be paid.The White House plans to pay the troops on 31 October by using money from a military housing fund, a research-and-development account, and a defence procurement fund, according to Axios, a political news outlet.Earlier this month, the administration made payroll by moving $6.5bn from military research.More than 160 families told the National Military Family Association, an advocacy group, that they have been underpaid during the shutdown, some by hundreds of dollars and others by thousands.Heat amid the winter chillAround six million Americans use a federal assistance initiative called the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (Liheap) for help paying utility bills.The government usually sends Liheap funds directly to utility companies in mid-November.The temperature is already dropping in northern areas, where Americans heat their homes with propane, electric and natural gas. Many states bar natural gas and electric companies from cutting off service to people who do not pay their bills, but those rules do not apply to propane or heating oil. Experts say thousands could face deadly conditions unless the government reopens or the government finds another resolution, such as a nationwide moratorium on cutting off heat in the shutdown.Watch: \"It’s been difficult\" - Government workers resort to food banksFederal civilian workersThousands of Americans work for the federal government as civilian employees and many of those folks will miss a paycheque this week. It has been a slow burn for many, with the side effects of the shutdown getting worse. Some civilian employees were able to get a week or two of compensation, while others have not seen a dollar since 1 October. Among those going without pay beginning this week are congressional aides on Capitol Hill. Food banks and food pantries across the US have already said they have seen an increase in the number of federal workers asking for help - particularly in Washington, DC.If the shutdown continues until 1 December, some 4.5 million paycheques will be withheld from federal civilian employees, making for about $21bn in missing wages, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Furloughed employees are typically paid after shutdowns end, although Trump has threatened to withhold pay and is currently trying to fire thousands of workers, which is being challenged in court.Air traffic controllersThousands of air traffic controllers missed their first paycheques this week. Because they are considered essential workers, they must continue to do their jobs without pay during the shutdown.  Since 1 October, numerous controllers have called in sick and now many report they are getting second jobs.In turn, thousands of US flyers have faced widespread delays. “The problems are mounting daily,” Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said at a press conference this week.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has said many of the flight delays in recent days and weeks have been the result of absence by air traffic controllers. Duffy has warned controllers could be fired if they fail to show up for work.",

    "body": "'Can't go back' - families in violence-hit Indian state fear resettlement deadline8 hours agoJugal PurohitBBC HindiMidhat Ullah HasaniChingakham Radha has moved to a temporary shelter but longs to return home Thousands of people displaced by ethnic clashes in India's north-eastern state of Manipur two years ago now face an uncertain future, as the government plans to shut down all temporary relief camps by December.The violence, which erupted in May 2023 between the majority Meitei and the indigenous Kuki communities, was the worst the region had witnessed in decades.It started after protests by the largely Christian Kuki community against the Meiteis, mostly Hindus, who were demanding official tribal status that would grant them access to the same government benefits and job quotas as other tribes, including Kukis.At least 260 people were killed in the clashes and around 60,000 displaced people have since been living in temporary shelters.Over the past two years, the government has made repeated promises to rehabilitate the displaced, but little has changed on the ground. Many say their lives remain in a limbo - effectively homeless and without a steady source of income.Anxieties grew further in July when the state's then Chief Secretary Prashant Singh announced that all relief camps would be shut down by December and its residents would be resettled.He added that those unable to return to their homes would be relocated to pre-fabricated housing units. The government, however, did not clarify where these units would be - whether near the relief camps or near displaced people's original homes  - worsening their concerns about future. Uncertainty grew in September when Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his first visit to Manipur since the violence began, announced that 7,000 new homes would be built to resettle the displaced in \"appropriate locations\" without giving any other details. Midhat Ullah HasaniThousands are still living in relief camps in the hilly Churachandpur regionOn the ground, Manipur remains sharply divided: the Meiteis inhabit the Imphal Valley, while the Kukis live in the surrounding hill districts; and security forces continue to patrol the buffer zones that separate the two communities.A security official deployed in the area told BBC Hindi that his mandate was to \"ensure that Meiteis and Kukis remain in their respective areas and do not mix\".Experts say resettling people in their original neighbourhoods is crucial to prevent the violence from redrawing Manipur's social map.\"This is not good for a secular, democratic India. Resettling them in their original homes is most critical,\" said RK Nimai Singh, former secretary to the Manipur governor.He added that many displaced people feared that if they left the relief camps and moved into temporary housing, they might never be able to return to their homes. It's a thought that haunts Hatnu Haokip. For her, home means only one place - Imphal valley - and she yearns to go back. \"But that can't happen because our village is now surrounded by Meitei people,\" said the 22-year-old who is now living in a relief camp in the hilly Churachandpur regionMs Haokip added that she would feel safer if Kuki leaders were given autonomy to set up a separate federally-administered territory for the community. This sentiment was echoed by several other Kukis, who also feel apprehensive of returning to their homes. On the other hand, most Meiteis BBC Hindi spoke to said they wanted to go back home. Irom Abung, who once ran a water supply business in Churachandpur, now lives in a relief camp near a buffer zone.His house was damaged during the violence, but Mr Abung says he will never give up on the place he once called home.\"My land remains. I will never sell it because I know I will return one day,\" he said. \"Efforts must be made to bridge the gap between our two communities so people can go back to their lives.\"The unease, coupled with uncertainty over where the new homes will be built, has raised doubts over whether the government would be able to close all relief camps by December.Government officials, however, insist that the resettlement plan is on track.\"From about 290 camps initially, we've brought the number down to around 260,\" a senior Manipur government official said.\"Eventually, we want to resettle people in the areas from where they fled, once they feel safe to return.\"The official added that while they understood people's concerns, it was also in the state's interest for them to return home - otherwise, the divisions would only grow deeper.Midhat Ullah HasaniMany women in the relief camps are crocheting and selling dolls to earn a little extra income to support their familiesAs tens of thousands of people continue to live in relief camps, many complain about not getting the facilities the government promised them.Nemhoichong Lhungdim, a single mother, said her 11-year-old son had suffered a debilitating eye injury a few months back and has lost sight in one eye.After government doctors failed to help, she borrowed money to take him to a private hospital, but was unable to afford the treatment.\"I was told it would cost about 300,000 rupees ($3,400; £2,600). I don't have that kind of money,\" she said.Ms Lhungdim says the government sometimes organises health camps, but they have never treated her son. BBC Hindi has reached out to officials for a response.Inside the camps, residents say prolonged displacement and uncertainty are also taking a toll on people's mental health.Salam Monika, 25, says her uncle took his own life last year after being driven to despair by a lack of livelihood opportunities. She says the family could not access medical help.\"Some mental health workers visited our camp a few times since 2023, but this year, they haven't come at all,\" she said.BBC Hindi has reached out to the government for comment.Meanwhile, those moved from camps into temporary housing say that while they now have a roof over their heads, they still struggle to make ends meet as livelihood remains a concern.Chingakham Radha, one of the newly resettled residents, said she learned to make crochet dolls while living in the camp and now earns a small income from selling them. \"The money is very little, just enough to get by,\" she said.Before the conflict, Ms Radha was a homemaker and her husband worked as a labourer. They were not wealthy, but had a happy life.Thinking about those days, Ms Radha says life has become uncertain now. \"Some days my husband finds work, but other times weeks go by without any work,\" she said. \"I want to return home to Churachandpur, but those hopes are fading with time.\"Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "15 hours agoVanessa Buschschlüter and Rute Pina,BBC Brasil, reporting from São PauloBruno ItanDozens of bodies were laid out in a square in Penha, in northern Rio, after the deadliest police raid in the city's historyA photographer who witnessed the aftermath of a massive Brazilian police operation in Rio de Janeiro has told the BBC of how residents came back with mutilated bodies of those who had died.The bodies \"kept coming: 25, 30, 35, 40, 45...\", Bruno Itan told BBC Brasil. They included those of police officers.One of the bodies had been decapitated - others were \"totally disfigured\", he said. Many also had what he says were stab wounds. More than 120 people were killed during Tuesday's raid on a criminal gang - the deadliest such raid in the city.EPA/ShutterstockMore than 100 people were arrested as part of the operationBruno Itan told BBC Brasil that he was first alerted to the raid early on Tuesday by residents of the Alemão neighbourhood, who sent him messages telling him there was a shoot-out. The photographer made his way to the Getúlio Vargas hospital, where the bodies were arriving.Itan says that the police stopped members of the press from entering the Penha neighbourhood, where the operation was under way. \"Police officers formed a line and said: 'The press doesn't get past here.'\"But Itan, who grew up in the area, says he was able to make his way into the cordoned-off area, where he remained until the next morning. He says that Tuesday night, local residents began to search the hillside which divides Penha from the nearby Alemão neighbourhood for relatives who had been missing since the police raid.Bruno ItanResidents of the Penha neighbourhood proceeded to place the recovered bodies in a  square - and Itan's photos show the reaction of the people there. \"The brutality of it all impacted me a lot: the sorrow of the families, mothers fainting, pregnant wives, crying, outraged parents,\" the photographer recalled.Bruno ItanThere was shock in Penha as locals retrieved more and more bodies from the nearby  hillsideThe governor of Rio state said that the massive police operation involving around 2,500 security personnel was aimed at stopping a criminal group known as Comando Vermelho (Red Command) from expanding its territory.Initially, the Rio state government maintained that \"60 suspects and four police officers\" had been killed in the operation.They have since said that their \"preliminary\" count shows that 117 \"suspects\" have been killed.Rio's public defender's office, which provides legal assistance to the poor, has put the total number of people killed at 132.According to researchers, Red Command is the only criminal group which in recent years has managed to make territorial gains in the state of Rio de Janeiro.It is widely considered one of the two largest gangs in the country, alongside First Capital Command (PCC), and has a history dating back more than 50 years. According to Brazilian journalist Rafael Soares, who has been covering crime in Rio for years, Red Command \"operates like a franchise\" with local criminal leaders forming part of the gang and becoming \"business partners\".The gang engages primarily in drug trafficking, but also smuggles guns, gold, fuel, alcohol and tobacco.According to the authorities, gang members are well armed and police said that during the raid, they came under attack from explosive-laden drones. The governor of Rio state, Cláudio Castro, described Red Command members as \"narcoterrorists\" and called the four police officers killed in the raid \"heroes\".But the number of people killed in the operation has come in for criticism with the  Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights saying it was \"horrified\".At a news conference on Wednesday, Governor Castro defended the police force.\"It wasn't our intention to kill anyone. We wanted to arrest them all alive,\" he said.He added that the situation had escalated because the suspects had retaliated: \"It was a consequence of the retaliation they carried out and the disproportionate use of force by those criminals.\"The governor also said that the bodies displayed by locals in Penha had been \"manipulated\". In a post on X, he said that some of them had been stripped of the camouflage clothing he said they had been wearing \"in order to shift blame onto the police\".Felipe Curi of Rio's civil police force also said that \"camouflage clothing, vests, and weapons\" had been removed from the bodies and showed footage appearing to show a man cutting camouflage clothing off a corpse. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes has summoned Governor Castro to a hearing on Monday to explain the police actions \"in detail\".With additional reporting by BBC Brasil's Carol Castro in Rio de Janeiro.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump has announced the US will start testing nuclear weapons in what could be a radical shift in his nation's policy.\"Because of oth",
    "body": "President Donald Trump has announced the US will start testing nuclear weapons in what could be a radical shift in his nation's policy.\"Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, as he was about to meet the Chinese president  on Thursday. \"That process will begin immediately.\"The world's nuclear-armed states - those acknowledged as belonging to the so-called nuclear club and those whose status is more ambiguous - regularly test their nuclear weapons' delivery systems, such as a missile that would carry a nuclear warhead.Only North Korea has actually tested a nuclear weapon since the 1990s - and it has not done so since 2017.The White House has not issued any clarifications to the commander-in-chief's announcement. So it remains unclear whether Trump means testing nuclear delivery systems or the destructive weapons themselves. In comments after his post, he said nuclear test sites would be determined later.Many of the six policy experts who spoke to the BBC said that testing nuclear weapons could raise the stakes in an already dangerous moment where all signs showed the world was heading in the direction of a nuclear arms race - even though it has not yet begun. One of the six did not agree that Trump's comments would have a major impact - and another did not think the US was provoking a race - but all said the world faced a rising nuclear threat.\"The concern here is that, because nuclear armed states have not conducted these nuclear tests in decades - setting North Korea aside - this could create a domino effect,\" said Jamie Kwong, fellow in the nuclear policy programme at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"We're at a very concerning moment where the US, Russia and China are potentially entering this moment that could very well become an arms race.\"Darya Dolzikova, Senior Research Fellow for Proliferation and Nuclear Policy at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) - a London-based defence and security think tank - said she did not believe Trump's comments would change the situation massively.But, she added, \"there are other dynamics globally that have raised the risks of nuclear exchange and further proliferation of nuclear weapons to levels higher than they have been in decades\".Trump's message,  she said, \"is a drop in a much larger bucket, and there are some legitimate concerns of that bucket overfilling\".The experts pointed to escalating conflicts where one or more of the warring parties is a nuclear power - the war in Ukraine, for instance, in which Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened at times that he could use nuclear weapons. And then there were flare-ups - if not full-fledged conflicts - such as the one between Pakistan and India this year, or Israel - which has a policy of neither confirming nor denying it has nuclear weapons - attacking Iran - a country the West accuses of trying to build nuclear weapons (a charge Tehran denies). Tensions on the Korean peninsula and China's ambitions in Taiwan add to the overall picture.The last existing nuclear treaty between the US and Russia that limits their amounts of deployed nuclear arsenals - warheads ready to go - is set to expire in February next year.In his announcement, Trump said the US had more nuclear weapons than any other country - a statement that does not match figures updated regularly by another think tank that specialises in the field, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri).According to Sipri, Russia has 5,459 nuclear warheads followed by the US with 5,177, and China coming a distant third with 600.Other think tanks reported similar numbers.Russia announced recently it had tested new nuclear weapons delivery systems - including a missile the Kremlin said could penetrate US defences and another that could go underwater to strike the US coast.The latter claim may have led to Trump's announcement, some of the experts suspected, even though Russia said its tests \"were not nuclear\".Meanwhile, the US has been watching China closely - with increasing concern that it will reach near-peer status, too, and posing a \"two-peer nuclear risk\", experts said.So a resumption of US nuclear testing could prompt China and Russia to do the same. A Kremlin spokesman said that \"if someone departs from the moratorium, Russia will act accordingly\".In its response, China said it hoped the US would fulfil its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty - which both countries have signed but not ratified - and honour its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association, said a US resumption of nuclear weapons testing would be \"a mistake of historic international security proportions\".He said the risk of nuclear conflict \"has been steadily rising\" over several years and, unless the US and Russia \"negotiate some form of new constraints on their arsenals, we're likely going to see an unconstained, dangerous, three-way arms race between the US, Russia and then China in the coming years\".Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, said the average person should be \"very concerned\" because there has been an increase over the past five years in nuclear warheads for the first time since the Cold War.The last US nuclear weapons test - underground in Nevada - was in 1992. Kimball said it would take at least 36 months to get the Nevada site ready for use again.The US currently uses computer simulations and other non-explosive means to test its nuclear weapons, and therefore does not have a practical justification to detonate them, multiple experts said.Kwong said there were inherent risks even with underground testing, because you must ensure there is not a radioactive leak above ground and it does not affect groundwater.While blaming Russia and China for ratcheting up the rhetoric, Robert Peters, senior research fellow of strategic deterrence at the conservative Heritage Foundation,  said that, while there may not be a scientific or technical reason for testing a warhead, \"the primary reason is to send a political message for your opponents\".\"It may be necessary for some president, whether it's Donald Trump or whomever, to test nuclear weapons as a demonstration of credibility\", he said, arguing it was \"not an unreasonable position to hold\" to be prepared to test.While many others the BBC spoke to disagreed, all offered a fairly dire assessment of the current situation.\"My sense is that, if the new nuclear arms race hasn't already begun, then we're currently heading towards the starting line,\" said Rhys Crilley, who writes on the subject at the University of Glasgow. \"I worry every day about the risks of a nuclear arms race and the increasing risk of nuclear war.\"The US tested the first atomic bomb in July 1945 in the desert at Alamogordo, New Mexico.It later became the only country in the world to use nuclear weapons in warfare after dropping two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August of the same year during World War Two.",

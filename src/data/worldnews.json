    "body": "The bodies of a 34-year-old woman and her daughter, 10, have been found inside freezers in an apartment in western Austria.The remains of the Syrian woman and child, who had been missing for several months, were discovered on Friday. The freezers were hidden behind a drywall partition in the flat, located in the city of Innsbruck.Two men, a 55-year-old Austrian and his 53-year-old brother, were arrested in June. The older man, a colleague of the Syrian woman, told police last week there had been an accident - but denied murder.Speaking to reporters earlier, Hansjörg Mayr, a spokesman for the public prosecutor's office, said the pair were being held on \"strong suspicion of murder\".The names of those involved have not been released by police, in accordance with Austrian law. The family's disappearance was first reported by the woman's cousin, who lives in Germany, on 25 July 2024. Police said the woman's colleague - the 55-year-old man - told them at the time she had gone on an extended trip with her child to visit her parents in Turkey.Her bank card was then found to have been used abroad several times. But when police searched the woman's home, her mobile phone was found.A witness also reported hearing a loud noise in the apartment, and cries of \"mama\", on the day the two were thought to have disappeared. A wider police investigation was launched, with officers discovering various messages sent from the woman's phone - including a resignation letter to her employer and messages to the male colleague. Authorities said a four-figure sum was also transferred to the man.Katja Tersch, head of the State Criminal Police Office in Tyrol, told reporters on Tuesday that a storage unit had been rented out before the victims' disappearance and a freezer had been placed there. The brothers removed the freezer from the unit on the day the woman and her child disappeared, Tersch said. And a week later, they acquired another freezer. Authorities say they believe this suggests the deaths were premeditated. \"The cause of death could not be determined due to the state of decomposition of the bodies,\" Tersch said.Mayr - of the public prosecutor's office - said the exact sequence of events is not yet known, but the bodies were professionally hidden and not discovered during a previous house search.While the brothers were arrested in June, it was not until 12 November that the 55-year-old admitted to an incident and to hiding the bodies. He denies any intent to kill, authorities said. Meanwhile, his younger brother admitted to a cover-up but denied knowledge of a homicide.The pair are currently in pre-trial detention in prisons in Innsbruck and Salzburg, around 117 miles (189km) apart.In a joint statement, Austria's Minister for Women Eva-Maria Holzleitner and Justice Minister Anna Sporrer said the \"alleged double murder... represents the sudden and brutal end of two human lives and exposes a cruel system\".\"Women and girls are being murdered due to the mere fact that they are women and girls,\" they continued.\"Femicides are a deeply rooted and society-wide problem that we must fight resolutely.\"",

    "body": "A Lebanese man has gone on trial in Celle, northern Germany, accused of being a member of Hezbollah - a Shia Muslim group whose military wing is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the EU.The 35 year-old man, named only as Fadel Z, in line with German privacy laws, is charged with having played a key role in procuring products for Hezbollah's drone programme.The German Federal Prosecutor's Office said Fadel Z joined Hezbollah more than 10 years ago, first working in public relations.In a statement, prosecutors said Fadel Z became a \"foreign operator\" for the group's drone programme in 2022, first from Barcelona in Spain. In the summer of 2023, he started working from Germany.According to the statement by prosecutors, Hezbollah has been running \"an extensive drone programme for some time\".Following Hamas's 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, prosecutors said Hezbollah had \"systematically fired rockets and explosive-laden drones at both military and civilian targets in Israel\".\"By June 2024, it had built up an arsenal of over 10,000 [drone] units.\"To procure such drones \"the organisation employs foreign operatives who covertly purchase components in Europe and export them to Lebanon\", prosecutors said.Fadel Z is accused of purchasing materials and products for drone construction worth around €1.4m (£1.2m), until he was arrested in July 2024.The products came from companies in Europe, China and the US.According to prosecutors, these included more than 2,000 petrol and electric motors, and over 600 propellers.Fadel Z is said to have often used front companies registered in his own name or that of his contacts to place orders. Suppliers were also paid via these companies.Prosecutors say he also arranged for the goods to be transported to Lebanon - where the group is based - either by container ship from ports in Hamburg or Spain or by air freight.Two of the engines purchased by Fadel Z were used in explosive drones that Hezbollah fired at Israel, they added.One of the drones was flown into a retirement home in the town of Herzliya, near Tel Aviv, on the night of 11 October 2024, the Jewish Holy Day of Yom Kippur.Although the explosive device detonated inside the building, none of the 200 or so residents was injured.The Federal Prosecutor's Office said it considered this to be aiding and abetting attempted murder.The trial at the regional court in Celle is expected to last until August next year.Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated after Hezbollah fired rockets at Israeli positions the day after Hamas's attacks on Israel in October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah fought an escalating conflict for 13 months. It culminated in an intense Israeli bombing campaign and ground incursion into southern Lebanon in October.Lebanese authorities said Israel's attacks killed about 4,000 people there - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israeli authorities said more than 80 of its soldiers and 47 of its civilians were killed in the hostilities.",

    "body": "4 hours agoAdam Easton,Warsaw correspondent and Jaroslav LukivTwo Ukrainian citizens who long worked for Russian intelligence have been identified as the suspects behind two acts of sabotage on Poland's rail network, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said.One suspect had already been convicted in absentia of acts of sabotage in Ukraine, Tusk told parliament.On Monday, he visited the scene of an explosion near Mika, south-east of Warsaw, which damaged the railway line leading to the Ukrainian border at the weekend, and called it an \"unprecedented act of sabotage\".Another incident down the line near Pulawy on Monday forced a packed train to stop suddenly and damage was found to overhead cables.The Kremlin brushed off suggestions of Russian involvement.Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said: \"It would have been really strange, if Russia hadn't been blamed first.\"\"Russia is accused of all acts of hybrid and direct war... in Poland,\" he told Russia's state-run media, adding: \"Russophobia is certainly rampant there.\"Polish authorities had initially said there was a very high chance that the two acts of sabotage on the Warsaw-Lublin railway line had been ordered by a \"foreign service\". Then a spokesman for Poland's special services minister said on Tuesday that \"everything points to them being Russian special services\".\"The goal was to cause a rail catastrophe,\" Tusk told MPs.The Polish prime minister said he would not disclose the names of the two suspects as this could complicate the operation, though he told parliament that one was living in Belarus and the other was a resident of eastern Ukraine.Both suspects had crossed into Poland from Belarus during the autumn and had now returned there via the border crossing at Terespol in the far south-west of Belarus, close to the Ukrainian border, he added.Tusk said that a military-grade C4 explosive device had been detonated on 15 November at about 21:00 (20:00 GMT) near the village of Mika.The explosion, which happened as a freight train was passing, caused minor damage to a wagon floor. It was captured on CCTV.Tusk said the train driver had not even noticed the incident.A previous attempt to derail a train by placing a steel clamp on the rail had failed, he added.The second act of sabotage, on 17 November, involved a train carrying 475 passengers having to suddenly brake because of damaged railway infrastructure, said Tusk.The prime minister also said he would issue an order later on Tuesday to raise the alert level on certain railway lines.He said since the start of last year 55 people had been detained on suspicion of assisting, preparing, or committing acts of sabotage and that 23 of them had been remanded in custody.Russia's motivation, Tusk went on, was to sow panic and stir up anti-Ukrainian sentiment in Polish society, which is home to more than one million Ukrainian war refugees.\"I want to emphasise that what the Russian authorities care about is not only the direct effect of this type of action, but also the social and political consequences of the fact that this action is taking place,\" he said.\"This of course means disorganisation, chaos, panic, speculation and uncertainty.\"Poland is both a Nato and EU member state, and its railway network has become vital for moving supplies of aid into Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.In September, Tusk said three Russian drones had been shot down by Polish and other Nato aircraft in Poland's airspace during overnight attacks on Ukraine.He said at the time that authorities had recorded 19 drone incursions, with some flying deep enough to temporarily close four airports, including Warsaw's main hub Chopin.Russia's defence ministry responded by saying there had been \"no plans\" to target facilities on Polish soil.",

    "body": "10 hours agoAndrew HardingParis correspondentA French energy company is facing war crimes allegations, which it denies, over a massacre near its multi-billon dollar international gas project in northern Mozambique in 2021.In a complaint filed with French prosecutors, a human rights group accused TotalEnergies of complicity in war crimes, including the torture and execution of dozens of civilians held by local security forces in a cluster of shipping containers at its facility.Total has always denied responsibility for the actions of government troops and related security forces who were involved in guarding the Afungi peninsula gas refinery development.It was the biggest foreign investment project in Africa at the time.The complaint was filed by the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), a human rights group.\"Companies and their executives are not neutral actors when they operate in conflict zones. If they enable or fuel crimes, they might be complicit and should be held accountable,\" said Clara Gonzales, the ECCHR's co-programme director for business and human rights.The massacre by Mozambican forces took place in resource-rich Cabo Delgado province, where government troops were battling violent Islamist militants, linked to the Islamic State group, with a gruesome reputation for beheading victims.In March 2021, Islamists attacked the besieged town of Palma, where they killed or  kidnapped 1,563 civilians living next to TotalEnergies gas plant on Mozambique's remote northern Afungi peninsula, according to Alex Perry.The investigative journalist first documented the Palma death toll, and the subsequent reprisal massacre at the entrance to Total's compound, for Politico in 2024.Perry called it the \"bloodiest disaster in oil and gas history\".Locals who sought help from the forces at the Total facility were accused of aiding the insurgents. Men were separated from the group by force and held in shipping containers. The exact number of civilians subsequently killed by Mozambican  forces providing security for Total is not clear. Perry identified 97 victims but estimates the true figure could be double that.\"Most people have never heard about any of this, in part because Total has acknowledged none of it. Today is a victory for truth, and accountability,\" Perry told the BBC.The BBC has contacted TotalEnergies for comment. The British government initially offered financial guarantees for UK companies seeking to take part in what was heralded as an unprecedented opportunity for economic development in Mozambique. But after suspending support following the bloodshed in Palma, Britain is now being urged to walk away by environmental campaigners, who say the gravity of the allegations against Total must be a \"red line\" for the financial backers of its liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique.Total continued to \"demonstrate that it has learned nothing from the past: it just announced the lifting of the force majeure on its gas project, despite the dramatic security and humanitarian situation\", Lorette Philippot from Friends of the Earth France said.The UK and Dutch governments must \"refuse to renew their financial support and withdraw from Mozambique LNG\", she added, like French banks Société Générale and Crédit Agricole.Supporters of TotalEnergies' determination to proceed with the vast project in Cabo Delgado say it is a bold investment that could bring huge rewards to a neglected region of Africa.But critics say it is an environmental, ethical and financial disaster. They draw links between Total's actions and struggles and those of another giant French company, Lafarge, which went on trial in France this month, along with eight former employees, over allegations that it paid jihadist groups in Syria to keep a cement plant there in operation.",

It shows me also our shared humanity, how alike we are in so, so many ways. \"And no matter where we come from, in that theatre, we laugh together, we feel together, we hope together, we dream together. And that is the power of this art form. \"And that is why it matters, that is why it matters to me. So making films is not what I do, it is who I am.\"Cruise made his film debut in 1981 and was previously nominated for best actor for Born on the Fourth of July and Jerry Maguire. He was also nominated as best supporting actor in the film Magnolia and for producing Top Gun: Maverick.The Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences selected Cruise for his \"incredible commitment to our film-making community, to the theatrical experience, and to the stunts community\", the organisation said.The Risky Business actor told the ceremony that cinema made the world much larger than the one that he knew as a child. \"It opened my eyes. It opened my imagination to the possibility that life could expand far beyond the boundaries that I then perceived in my own life. And that beam of light opened a desire to open the world, and I have been following it ever since.\"The actor, who famously performs his own stunts, has also been a fervent advocate for cinema as the streaming industry and social media compete for viewers' time and attention.\"I want you to know that I will always do everything I can to help this art form, to support and champion new voices, to protect what makes cinema powerful - hopefully without too many more broken bones.\"Notably, earlier this year Cruise was reportedly set to be recognised by US President Donald Trump when he announced his picks for this year's Kennedy Center honours but the actor declined due to scheduling conflicts.",

    "body": "Ex-Harvard president Larry Summers steps back from public role after Epstein email release9 hours agoMax MatzaReutersFormer Harvard University president Larry Summers has said he will step back from public commitments after his emails with disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein were made public.\"I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognise the pain they have caused,\" he said in a statement to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. Emails released by a House committee last week show Summers, a former US treasury secretary, communicated with Epstein until the day before the Epstein's 2019 arrest for the alleged sex trafficking of minors.On Tuesday, House members are expected to vote on a measure calling for the release of all Epstein-related files that have yet to be made public.The measure would then head to the Senate, and require the approval of US President Donald Trump.Summers served as treasury secretary under former President Bill Clinton and director of the National Economic Council under former President Barack Obama. He was president of Harvard from 2001 to 2006 and is currently a professor there.He wrote in his statement on Monday: \"I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein.\"He added that he wanted \"to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me\".\"While continuing to fulfil my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort,\" Summers wrote.The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington where Summers was a senior fellow, also announced on Monday that he was no longer affiliated with the organisation.Summers is still listed as a member of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI's board, which he joined in 2023 following a failed attempt to oust its chief executive Sam Altman. The BBC has contacted OpenAI and a representative for Summers about whether he will remain a director at the company.Summers' move comes after the US Department of Justice announced that it would investigate Epstein's \"involvement and relationship\" with former President Bill Clinton, who was also a friend of Epstein, and several other prominent Democrats.Clinton has strongly denied he had any knowledge of Epstein's crimes. The department's decision came at the urging of Trump, who also asked for Summers, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and banks JP Morgan and Chase, to be investigated.Hoffman is yet to comment. A spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase said the firm regretted \"any association\" it had with Epstein, and added that it \"did not help him commit his heinous acts\".Trump was also mentioned in the emails, which do not imply any wrongdoing.\"Epstein was a Democrat, and he is the Democrat's problem, not the Republican's problem!\" he wrote on social media.\"They all know about him, don't waste your time with Trump. I have a Country to run!\"The emails released by the House Oversight Committee last week indicate that Summers and Epstein met for dinner frequently, with Epstein often trying to connect Summers to prominent global figures. At one point, in July 2018, Epstein proposed a meeting with the \"president [sic] of united nations, interesting person for you\".In a separate email just after Trump's first election in 2016, Summers told Epstein to \"spend zero effort on anything about me with Trump\".Due to Trump's \"approach to conflict of interest\", Putin \"proximity\" and \"mindless response\" to Cuban leader Fidel Castro's death, Summers said he was \"best off a million miles away\".A representative for Summers previously told US media that he \"deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein\" after Epstein's conviction in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor.The emails mention many high-profile figures. A review by the Wall Street Journal found Trump was mentioned in more than 1,600 of the 2,324 email threads.Trump has repeatedly said he severed contact with the financier years before Epstein was convicted in 2008, and was unaware of his criminal activity. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.While Trump was discussed in some of the messages released last week, he did not send or receive them.",

It said fewer than 30 Palestinians died in Israeli custody in the 10 years prior.The Israel Prison Service (IPS) told the BBC it \"operates in accordance with the law and under the supervision of official oversight bodies\".It said it did not comment on figures or allegations from outside bodies.\"All inmates are held according to legal procedures, and their rights including access to medical care, hygiene, and adequate living conditions are upheld by professionally trained staff,\" the IPS added.Since 7 October 2023, thousands of Palestinians have been detained across Gaza and the West Bank, many without charge.PHRI said it had exposed a deeply concerning pattern of systematic human rights violations committed against Palestinians detained by Israel and classified as \"security prisoners\".It said this was carried out as part of an official policy implemented by Israeli authorities since the war began.Israeli authorities have stopped providing information about Palestinians in custody to the Red Cross and barred access to detention facilities.PHRI said its report is based on official records and data cross-referenced with forensic reports, information from other human rights groups and efforts to locate specific people, as well as testimony from detainees, their families and lawyers.Its authors say 52 of those who died were being held in military prisons while 42 died in civilian jails run by the IPS.PHRI says the deaths were caused by physical violence, medical neglect, or both.It singles out the policies of Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel's right-wing national security minister and a key member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government.PHRI said that, under Ben-Gvir's control, Israel's incarceration facilities holding Palestinians had \"effectively been transformed into sites of torture and abuse\".It added daily physical violence was widespread, and that the deprivation of human rights and systematic torture had resulted in the deaths of dozens of Palestinians.The highest number of deaths, 29, occurred at the Sde Teiman military prison in Southern Israel, near Gaza.Five Israeli reservist soldiers have been charged with aggravated abuse and causing serious bodily harm, after a Palestinian prisoner was allegedly beaten and stabbed in the rectum with a sharp object at Sde Teiman in July 2024.Footage emerged showing reserve soldiers taking a detainee aside and surrounding him with riot shields before he was allegedly attacked. The five reservists deny the charges and have not been named.The alleged assault has divided the nation, with some right-wing politicians criticising a military police investigation and even some \"right to rape\" protests outside the jail.The PHRI report accuses the Israeli authorities of trying to \"cover up\" and suppress investigations into Palestinian deaths and alleged abuses in custody.In said that, in many cases, detainees' family members were not notified that their relatives had died and access to post-mortems was denied.The report also said there had been a failure to prosecute Israeli prison staff and soldiers.It examined a policy of what it called \"forced disappearance\", through which thousands of Palestinians have been detained without their families being notified or told where their relatives are being held.PHRI said these \"grave violations of international law\" had made determining the full scope of Israel's prisoner policy and the fate of the many Palestinians taken into custody extremely difficult, if not impossible.The group estimates the actual number of Palestinians killed could be higher than the number it has been able to document.The IPS said \"the claims described do not reflect the conduct or procedures of the Israel Prison Service, and we are not aware of the incidents as presented\".It continued: \"Every death in IPS custody is examined in accordance with established procedures and referred to the competent authorities as required.\"For reasons of privacy, security, and legal limitations, the IPS does not provide personal or statistical details regarding inmates, nor does it comment on individual cases.\"The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it operates \"in accordance with Israeli and international law\", and \"detains individuals in Gaza when there is reasonable suspicion of their involvement in terrorist activities\".It said that, in some cases, criminal proceedings were then initiated, while in others \"preventive detention is enforced to remove individuals from the fighting, in full alignment with the Israeli law and the Geneva Conventions\". \"Detention orders and their duration are subject to judicial review as required by law,\" it added.The IDF said it was aware of incidents of detainees dying in custody, but that these included people detained with existing illness or injury, adding each death was investigated by military police.",

    "description": "US special envoy Steve Witkoff is set to join talks with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara on Wednesda",
    "body": "US special envoy Steve Witkoff is set to join talks with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara on Wednesday, as the Ukrainian president said he wanted to \"intensify\" peace negotiations.\"Bringing the end of the war closer with all our might is Ukraine's top priority,\" Zelensky said, adding that efforts would also focus on resuming prisoner exchanges.Turkey has maintained ties with both Kyiv and Moscow and has previously hosted talks between the two factions.But no Russian representative is set to join the meeting in Ankara, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. He added that while there were \"no concrete plans\" for Vladimir Putin to speak to either the Turkish side or to Witkoff, the Russian president was \"of course open to a conversation\".Ankara will be the fourth capital Zelensky visits in only a few days. In Athens he secured a gas deal, in Paris he signed an agreement to obtain up to 100 fighter jets and in Madrid he held talks on co-operation with Spanish arms manufacturers.The visits are part of Zelensky's mission to try to shore up European support for Ukraine while Russian attacks on the country intensify and Moscow's troops close in on the key city eastern city of Pokrovsk.Domestically, Zelensky is facing the most serious crisis in years. Several members of his closest circle are under investigation for co-organising a large-scale criminal scheme, and two ministers have resigned. The scandal threatens to widen still and some EU leaders – who in December will decide whether to unblock a €140bn (£121bn) loan for Kyiv based on frozen Russian state assets – have warned Zelensky needs to do more to tackle corruption. As the fourth anniversary of the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 inches closer, Moscow and Kyiv remain fundamentally opposed in their views of how to end the war.Earlier in November Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russia's conditions for a peace deal had not changed since Putin laid them out in 2024.At the time, the Russian president demanded that Kyiv renounce any ambition to join Nato, as well as full Ukrainian withdrawal from the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.Zelensky has repeatedly argued that withdrawing from Donetsk and Luhansk – together known as the Donbas – would leave the rest of the country vulnerable to future attacks.Following a long meeting with Putin in April, Witkoff appeared to suggest that a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv hinged on the status of the contested Ukrainian regions as well as Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014. This stance led to tensions with Zelensky, who accused him of \"disseminating Russian narratives\". Zelensky and Witkoff have not met since early September. Although the summer saw a flurry of high-level talks and meetings - including between Trump and Putin - American efforts to bring a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine closer have stalled.At one point, it appeared Trump and Putin were about to meet again in Budapest –but that summit was scrapped, apparently after the US side became aware that Moscow had no intention of budging from several demands that were unacceptable to Kyiv.But contact between US and Russian officials has continued, albeit under the radar. Putin's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev was reportedly in Washington for meetings with Witkoff in late October, only days after Trump imposed sanctions on Russia's two biggest oil companies.",

    "body": "The US will sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, President Donald Trump told reporters ahead of a White House meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\"We will be doing that. We will be selling F-35 jets,\" Trump said. \"They've been a great ally.\"The leaders are expected to discuss deals on defence and civilian nuclear power during Tuesday's White House visit, the first by the de facto Saudi leader since journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed and dismembered at the hands of Saudi agents seven years ago.A US intelligence assessment said Prince Mohammed approved the operation that led to the killing. The crown prince denied any role in the murder.Prince Mohammed's last visit was during Trump's first term in 2018, the same year as Khashoggi's murder in Istanbul.While former President Joe Biden did not host the crown prince and promised to make the country a \"pariah\" over its human rights record, Biden did visit Saudi Arabia in 2022 to reach agreements on other issues. Biden said he raised Khashoggi's murder in that meeting.Trump and the crown prince already met in Riyadh in May. There, the US agreed to sell nearly $142bn (£107bn) worth of arms to Saudi Arabia  in what the White House described as the \"largest defence sales agreement in history\", as part of a $600bn investment deal. Saudia Arabia is the largest buyer of US arms.Some American defence officials have raised concerns about a potential sale of F-35s, considered the most advanced fighter jet in the world, to Saudi Arabia. They told US media that they feared it would give Saudi Arabia access to sensitive stealth technology, which the country could then share with China under a security partnership between the two powers.Officials in Israel are also worried, telling US and local media that a deal has the potential to hurt the country's military standing. Israel is the closest US ally in the Middle East and the only country in the region with F-35s.One F-35A jet costs on average $82.5m, according to lead manufacturer Lockheed Martin.During Tuesday's meeting, Trump is also expected to push for Saudi Arabia to sign the Abraham Accords he created and normalise relations with Israel. The Saudis have said that is conditional on a path to a Palestinian state - which the current Israeli government rejects.",

    "body": "Tanzania's image for stability has been \"stained\" by the unrest that hit the East African nation during last month's heavily disputed elections, President Samia Suluhu Hassan has acknowledged.Speaking as she swore in her new cabinet, Samia warned that the violence could \"set the country back\".\"We mostly depend on loans from international creditors, but what happened eroded our global credibility,\" the 65-year-old president said.She was declared the winner of October's presidential poll with 98% of the vote, but the opposition - which was barred from contesting - denounced the election as a \"mockery of democracy\".Lazarus Chakwera, Malawi's former president and the Commonwealth envoy, is due to arrive in Tanzania to lead reconciliation efforts between the two sides.Hundreds may have died as security forces crushed the protests under cover of a five-day internet blackout after the 29 October elections, according to the opposition. The authorities are yet to release an official death toll.Gruesome images and videos of dead Tanzanians have circulated online following the disputed elections, in which key opposition leaders were jailed or disqualified. The violence was shocking for a nation that had cultivated an image of calm and order for nearly six decades.At least 240 people were charged with treason after the protests.Last week, President Samia announced an official investigation into the unrest and urged prosecutors to consider reducing or dropping charges for detained individuals who were not directly involved in the protests.Samia came into office in 2021 following the death of President John Magufuli - and was initially praised for easing political repression, but the political space has since narrowed.On Tuesday, she cautioned that her next term could bring economic challenges, noting that securing financial support from international banks may not be easy.\"In the first term, we used to get loans from outside due to our stability and the progress we made. But the stain we brought upon ourselves could now hinder that,\" she said.\"For this reason, we must focus on mobilising domestic resources and harnessing our God-given resources,\" Samia told her ministers. One new appointment to the 27-member cabinet is her daughter, Wanu Hafidh Ameir, who was named deputy education minister.Wanu's husband, Mohamed Mchengerwa, remains in cabinet taking up the post of health minister. Seven members of the previous cabinet have lost their positions.On Monday, Commonwealth Secretary-General Shirley Botchwey said Chakwera was to lead \"constructive dialogue\" during his four-day mission to Tanzania.He is set to hold consultations with government officials, political party leaders, civil society groups, religious and traditional leaders and diplomatic representatives.",

    "body": "Georgina RannardClimate and science reporter, Belém, BrazilCOP30 host Brazil has created 10 new Indigenous territories, with the climate summit hit by protests in recent days.The designation means the areas, including one in part of the Amazon, will have their culture and environment protected under Brazilian law - though this is not always enforced.The move follows similar actions from President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, whose government recognised Indigenous possession of 11 territories last year. \"Each and every indigenous territory in Brazil is a reason to celebrate and is a reason for us to feel happy,\" Dinamam Tuxu from the group Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB) told the BBC at COP30.The latest measure will be formalised through a presidential decree. Mr Tuxu said APIB wants more lands to be recognised legally, giving groups the right to control what happens to the land within the borders.\"Indigenous peoples today protect 82% of the world's biodiversity. If you demarcate indigenous lands, you guarantee this area will be protected,\" he said.\"The traditional way of life of indigenous peoples protects the lands and automatically guarantees global warming will be tackled. Consequently the entire humanity benefits from it,\" he added.Some indigenous groups are attacked when they try to defend their land from cattle ranchers or groups trying to cut down trees for agriculture.On Sunday an indigenous leader from the Guarani Kaiowá community in the south of Brazil was killed during an attack, according to Survival International.Vicente Fernandes Vilhalva, 36, was shot in the head when gunmen surrounded the village, according to eyewitnesses who spoke to Survival International.Thousands protested on Saturday outside the UN's annual climate conference, with some carrying signs reading \"demarcation now\".And last week, demonstrators - some of whom were from Indigenous groups - carrying signs that read \"our forests are not for sale\" broke into the summit and tussled with security.Security around the conference has since increased noticeably, with more armed soldiers and police at the entrance. Lots of Indigenous groups do not have accreditation to go inside.But this remains the COP with the highest number of representatives from indigenous groups.\"This makes me very happy. We worked for two years and now we have at least 900 people inside the COP where they can negotiate and represent their communities,\" Kleber Karipuna, from APIB, told BBC News.More than 200 human rights groups wrote to UN officials on Monday criticising the enhanced security, saying it \"contributes to an increasing global trend towards the silencing of dissent, militarised response to protest, and marginalisation of those defending land and the environment\".Past recognition of Indigenous reserves banned mining and logging, as well as restricting commercial farming, in the areas they covered to prevent deforestation. Expanding the total area considered Indigenous territory could prevent up to 20% of additional deforestation and reduce carbon emissions by 26% by 2030, according to a study by the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil, the Amazon Environmental Research Institute and the Indigenous Climate Change Committee.The new protected areas span hundreds of thousands of hectares and are inhabited by thousands of people from the Mura, Tupinambá de Olivença, Pataxó, Guarani-Kaiowá, Munduruku, Pankará, and Guarani-Mbya indigenous peoples.One area overlaps more than 78% with the Amazon National Park, part of the bio-diverse rainforest which plays a crucial role in regulating the global climate and storing carbon.The Brazilian government's announcement came on Indigenous Peoples' Day at COP30 on Monday.Until the left-wing Lula re-entered office, no new Indigenous lands had been declared since 2018, it said.Under his far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, who promoted mining on Indigenous lands, the protections afforded to them were frequently not enforced.Lula's government has previously taken action to drive out illegal miners from indigenous lands.Currently, Indigenous lands encompass 117.4 million hectares - roughly equivalent to the size of Colombia, or around 13.8% of Brazil's territory. Hundreds of Indigenous groups live in Brazil, according to the country's census.The Amazon rainforest is already at risk of a renewed surge in deforestation as efforts grow to overturn a key ban to protect it. Thick and healthy forestry helps pull carbon out of the atmosphere.Carbon released through the burning of fossil fuels has contributed to climate change.Countries are gathering at COP30 in an effort to reach agreements on how to try to limit global average temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and keep them \"well below\" 2C.The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says a large body of scientific evidence shows that warming of 2C or more would bring serious consequences, including extreme heat, higher sea levels and threats to food security.",

    "body": "'I hated that I looked Asian': KPop Demon Hunters star on her struggle for acceptance20 hours agoChi Chi Izundu & Rebecca ThornBBC Global WomenBBCArden Cho stars as the voice of Rumi in KPop Demon Hunters, which topped Netflix charts in 93 countries\"I hated that I looked Asian, that I didn't have blue eyes and blonde hair, because that's what was beautiful at the time,\" says Arden Cho, the actress who voiced Rumi, star of Netflix's chart-topping animated film, KPop Demon Hunters.Speaking to the BBC World Service for the Global Women series, Cho, 40, is describing her childhood in Texas, as the eldest daughter of Korean immigrant parents and her struggle for acceptance in American society.In the film, which tells the story of a female K-Pop trio who must save the world from evil forces, Rumi has to come to terms with her identity as part human, part demon - and when Cho first read the script this resonated powerfully.\"Being born in America, feeling American but having people treat me like I'm not, trying to figure out my identity as an Asian-American, as a Korean-American, as a woman,\" she says.These were all elements of her early life that mirrored Rumi's journey.\"I can honestly say that at different points in my life, I hated a lot of myself and I wanted to be someone else.\"As kids, what you see shapes who you become and I feel like I just didn't see enough people that look like me.\"NetflixCho says the film has led to \"Korea being loved\" more than ever beforeWhen it launched on Netflix in June, KPop Demon Hunters registered 33 million views in just two weeks, and reached the top 10 of the Netflix charts in 93 countries. To star in the first Hollywood animated film set in Korea, with Korean leads, was for Cho \"a dream come true\" – but it has also made her a powerful role model for Asian-American children, of the kind that she lacked when she was young.Cho says many Korean-Americans have told her it's \"such a refreshing moment\", making them proud for the first time of their dual heritage and culture.\"I feel like K-Pop really, truly, has paved the way. K-beauty has had such a big impact on Korea being loved. But I feel like this movie is the one that tipped it over the edge of, everybody wants to go to Korea, now,\" Cho says.But the film's success was not guaranteed and Cho says she felt the team making it were \"sometimes facing an uphill battle\".\"I feel like it kind of sucks to say this, but any time there's an Asian-led project, people feel like it's a risk,\" she says.So, when she took on the role, she made an effort to meet everyone working on the film in person, she says.Getty ImagesJi-Young Yoo (left) and May Hong (right) are also voice actors in the filmThe film was released against the backdrop of increased immigration raids in the US as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation effort, targeting those who are in the country illegally, which sparked protests in many states.As an Asian-American living in the US \"it's heartbreaking and disappointing,\" says Cho. \"Immigrants have made America what it is.\"Korean news sources have estimated that up to 150,000 Korean immigrants without proper documentation, including adopted children, are among those who could be deported.Cho says that when she was younger, people didn't know what it meant to be Korean in the USAs an adult, Cho came to realise that the racism she had experienced when she was younger stemmed mainly from a lack of education, as people didn't know what it meant to be Korean or Asian.\"But now in this day and age, when I feel like the world and people should know better, it is beyond disappointing and sometimes I feel like we feel so hopeless,\" she says.Because of this, it feels very special, she says, that KPop Demon Hunters could bring \"hope and joy and love to all these different communities\".\"Maybe that's why it's sort of like this movie of the summer, because we just needed some hope and something to unite us all together.\"The growth of AI is a major concern for the film industry, raising the possibility that in future it could be used to make a film like KPop Demon Hunters.Cho says she is aware that AI is already being used to replicate actors' voices, but wants to \"have hope in humanity\" that people will still seek out art created by humans.\"Sure, I'm sure they're going to have AI actors and singers. I know they already exist. I know our voices are already being manipulated, but I hope people have some respect and want and love for something real.\"KPop Demon Hunters has also been dominating the global music charts, with seven tracks from its soundtrack featured on the Billboard Hot 100. It has its own fan art, and audiences around the world are demanding a sequel.Cho tells us she wishes she could answer the question of whether that will happen - but both she and fans will have to wait for Netflix or Sony Pictures Entertainment, which made the film, to give it the green light.\"I know there's lots of murmurs, I've heard wonderful things,\" she says. \"So we shall see, and I think everyone in the world would riot if there wasn't.\"Starting conversations, building connections and challenging misinformation through features, investigations, interviews and extraordinary stories",

    "body": "From bicycles to cash: The rising cost of India's poll promises19 hours agoNikhil InamdarBBC News, MumbaiHindustan Times via Getty ImagesCash transfer announcements, especially directed towards women, have become popular ahead of electionsFreebies are powering election victories in India, but can its states afford them? Over the years, handouts have taken different forms in the hotly contested political landscape of the world's largest democracy. Voters have been lured with everything from television sets to bicycles and sometimes even gold ornaments - blurring the fine line between welfare economics and pre-poll populism.In recent years, cash transfers, especially directed towards women, have become a popular election-winning strategy for political parties of all stripes.A sweeping victory last week in the eastern state of Bihar - India's poorest state - for an alliance led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is being credited in part to a 10,000 rupee ($112; £85.18) cash handout to the state's women. A record number of women turned out to vote in the election.Similar women-oriented financial support schemes were launched by Modi's party in other states like Maharashtra ahead of polls last year. Opposition parties have also promised similar schemes in some states ahead of elections.Economists like Jean Drèze have argued in favour of such giveaways. He says that while distinguishing between \"useful\" and \"wasteful\" handouts is important, it is only by extracting promises during elections that the poor in India get anything at all from their political representatives.On the other hand, despite his party's own track record on the issue, Modi has in the past warned of the dangers of \"revdi culture\" - likening election giveaways to the frivolous distribution of sweets. India's top court had also sought to curb the distribution of such \"irrational freebies\" during elections back in 2023.While there is broad agreement on the need for targeted subsidies to challenge the use of handouts as electoral bait, Indian elections are increasingly dominated by unaffordable, poll-driven freebie economics that states can ill afford.Hindustan Times via Getty ImagesModi (right) with incumbent Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar ahead of the electionAccording to research from brokerage Emkay Global, Bihar is facing considerable fiscal pressure, with the deficit or gap between what the state earns and spends at 6% of its gross domestic product (GDP).Despite this, the state announced pre-election schemes amounting to 4% of GDP, more than its capital outlay - money that could have been spent in job-creating, long-term assets that would have aided the state's development. It is just one example in a litany of states practising indiscriminate election populism, according to Emkay Global.\"Even good [fiscally prudent] states are now in the grip of freebie economics,\" the brokerage said, as a result of which the 3% fiscal deficit to GDP ceiling that has been mandated for states, to curb non-budgeted spending, is now actually the floor.Some estimates suggest that 21 of India's 29 states have crossed this 3% deficit target, with disproportionate costs imposed by election-driven spending being one of the reasons.The fact that such populism is unsustainable is illustrated by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led alliance's Ladki Bahin (Beloved Sister) financial assistance scheme, which led to a 0.4% jump in Maharashtra state's deficit, according to Emkay Global. It forced the government to roll back some of the promises once the polls were over.India's central bank has also flagged the rising burden of such subsidies on state-level debt as a key emerging concern.According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), while overall debt of Indian states declined to about 28.5% of GDP by March 2024 compared with the levels seen over the past decade, it remains well above the 20% recommended threshold, with new pressures emerging in the form of an increasing subsidy burden.\"An area of incipient stress is the sharp rise in expenditure on subsidies, driven by farm loan waivers, free/subsidised services (like electricity to agriculture and households, transport, gas cylinder) and cash transfers to farmers, youth and women,\" the RBI said in its 2024-25 report on state finances.\"States need to contain and rationalise their subsidy outgoes, so that such spending does not crowd out more productive expenditure.\"Hindustan Times via Getty ImagesState governments have distributed free cycles to female students in the pastThis warning comes as the private sector continues to hold back on investment in new job-creating factories, and the government, forced to slow its own capital spending on infrastructure, turns instead to tax cuts and giveaways to spur middle-class consumption.But with freebies seeing such success in Bihar - and more state elections looming - that warning is unlikely to be heeded.\"This [Bihar] election outcome reinforces the freebie wave that has swept states in the last two years, and with Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and crucially, West Bengal going to polls next year, one can expect this race to the bottom to continue,\" Emkay Global economists Medhavi Arora and Harshal Patel said in their note.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "Venezuela's Maduro 'ready to talk' as US ramps up pressure7 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterLatin America editor, BBC News Online'Face to face': Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro open to US talksVenezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro has said that he is willing to hold face-to-face talks with representatives of the Trump administration as US pressure on him grows.Maduro made the comment hours after US President Donald Trump said he had not ruled out deploying ground forces to the South American country.The Trump administration has accused Maduro - whose re-election last year was dismissed as rigged by many countries - of being the leader of a drugs cartel.Maduro has denied the allegation and accuses the US of trying to incite a war to gain control of Venezuela's oil reserves. Since Trump was sworn in to a second term in office in January, the US government has been increasing its pressure on Maduro.It has doubled the reward it offers for information leading to his capture to $50m (38m) and in August launched a counternarcotics operation targeting boats it accuses of transporting drugs from Venezuela to the US.More than 80 people have been killed in the US strikes on suspected vessels since, most of them in the Caribbean as well as some in the Pacific.According to US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, the aim of \"Operation Southern Spear\" is to remove \"narcoterrorists\" from the Western Hemisphere.But legal experts have questioned the legality of the strikes, pointing out that the US has provided no evidence that the boats were carrying drugs. It is also unclear how much of an impact the strikes are having on the wider flow of drugs, a significant portion of which cross the land border between Mexico and the US.The size of the US military deployment - which includes the US Navy's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford - has also led to speculation both in Venezuela and in the US that its real aim is to remove Maduro from power.Trump has been repeatedly asked by journalists about his government's plan and has given seemingly contradictory answers. Asked by US broadcaster CBS on 3 November whether the US was going to war with Venezuela, Trump said, \"I don't think so\".But on Sunday, when asked whether he would rule out US troops on the ground in Venezuela, he answered: \"No, I don't rule out that, I don't rule out anything.\"However, when pressed on whether he would speak to his Venezuelan counterpart directly, he said: \"I would probably talk to him, yeah.\"  \"I talk to everybody,\" Trump added. Also on Sunday, the US state department said it \"intended to designate Cartel de los Soles\", the Venezuelan drug trafficking gang it alleges is led by Maduro, as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO).But rather than doing so immediately, the state department said the move would become effective on 24 November. This delay - combined with Trump leaving the door open to direct talks - has been interpreted by some as a US ultimatum for Maduro: enter into negotiations or face even more draconian US measures.Being labelled as an FTO means it becomes illegal for US citizens to knowingly provide material support or resources to the group in question. According to the White House, it also then becomes the policy of the US to \"ensure the total elimination of these organisations' presence in the United States and their ability to threaten the territory, safety, and security of the United States\".Some analysts think that just as the Trump administration has argued that it is legal to target alleged drug boats in the Caribbean because of the danger they say they pose to US citizens, it could use the FTO designation to bolster support for strikes against the Cartel de los Soles on Venezuelan soil.In several of his recent public appearances, Maduro has addressed the US people directly, even speaking - and once even singing - in English. On Monday, he said \"dialogue, call, yes, peace, yes, war, no, never, never war\" and stressed that he was ready to talk \"face to face\" with anyone in the US \"who wants to talk to Venezuela\".Past attempts by various parties at negotiating with representatives of the Maduro government have failed. Talks between the Venezuelan opposition and the Maduro government mediated by Norway and held in Barbados broke down as did an earlier Vatican-backed effort at finding a way out of Venezuela's political crisis. While the US has been ratcheting up the pressure on Maduro, Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize Winner María Corina Machado has been trying to encourage the Venezuelan military to switch sides and turn on Maduro.Speaking and posting from an undisclosed location in Venezuela, where she has been hiding to escape arrest, Machado has long denounced the Maduro government as \"a criminal structure\" and called on Venezuelans to unite to depose it. On Tuesday, she uploaded what she called a \"freedom manifesto\" to social media in which she outlined her vision for a post-Maduro Venezuela. In it she states that \"we stand at the edge of a new era - one where our natural rights will prevail\" and argues that Maduro and his close allies need to be held accountable for \"crimes against humanity\", citing the mistreatment of political prisoners and detainees under his rule.

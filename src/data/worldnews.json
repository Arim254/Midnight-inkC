    "body": "2 days agoKatya Adler Europe EditorBBCSomething in Europe has snapped. Donald Trump doubled down again on Monday night in his insistence that the US \"has to have\" Greenland for national security reasons. He predicted that Europe's leaders aren't \"gonna push back too much\". But that's not the plan they have in mind when their paths cross with the US president at the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Wednesday.Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark - a member of the EU and of Nato.President Trump is now leaning heavily on Denmark's allies in both those organisations to abandon Copenhagen and let the US take control of Greenland, or face punitive taxes on all their exports to the United States.It's a horror scenario for European economies, which are already in the doldrums, especially those reliant on exporting to the US like Germany's car industry and Italy's luxury goods market.AFP via Getty ImagesPolls suggest that 55% of Americans don't want to buy GreenlandOn Monday Germany's finance minister said “we will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed,” after an emergency meeting ahead of the WEF with his French counterpart.The Trump threats landed like a slap in the face of European governments, who (separately, in the case of the EU and the UK) had only just settled tariff deals with the US president last year.\"We're living through uncharted territories. We've never seen this before. An ally, a friend of 250 years, is considering using tariffs… as a geopolitical weapon,\" said France's Finance Minister Roland Lescure.His German counterpart Lars Klingbeil added: \"A line has been crossed... You'll understand that today I'm not saying exactly what will happen. But one thing must be clear: Europe must be prepared.\"All of a sudden, the softly-softly approach to Trump, that Europe's leaders had clearly favoured since he returned for a second term to the White House, seems to have passed its sell-by date.Europe's good cop, bad cop approachIt's too early to read the last rites on transatlantic relations altogether but the EU, at least, is hoping to approach the US president in Switzerland this Wednesday at the Global Economic Forum \"speaking softly, while carrying a big stick\" to paraphrase a former US president.Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt believed that, to achieve your goals, you need diplomacy backed by credible power. And Europe now seems to be adopting a good cop, bad cop approach.European leaders are telling President Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over Greenland.At the same time, EU diplomats have let it be known they're considering imposing €93 billion (£80 billion) worth of tariffs on US goods or even restricting the access of American businesses, possibly including banks and high tech companies - to the bloc's massive single market, if Trump goes ahead with his \"Greenland tariffs\" as they've become known.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesEuropean leaders are telling Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over GreenlandThese retaliatory measures would most likely have a knock-on effect on US consumers too.European Union investors have a massive presence in nearly all 50 US states and are said to be responsible for employing 3.4 million Americans.The EU has a weak voice on the world stage of international diplomacy. The bloc is made up of 27 often bickering countries. But it has huge clout when it comes to the global economy and trade, where decisions are largely taken by the European Commission on behalf of EU single market members. The European Union is the world's biggest trader of goods and services, accounting for nearly 16% of world trade in 2024.So, Brussels is crossing its fingers that President Trump will climb down from from his maximalist position and negotiate a compromise solution, if he realises, that he may end up gaining an island (Greenland) but he'll probably lose close allies (Europe), and be seen as responsible for US consumer costs going up (because of EU retaliatory tariffs).\"Our priority is to engage, not escalate,\" EU Commission deputy spokesperson Olof Gill said on Monday.WPA Pool/Getty ImagesEurope needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security\"Trump is forcing the Europeans to grow a spine,\" says Niclas Poitiers, an economist and expert in international trade at the Brussels-based Bruegel think-tank.\"[While] the damage of [Trump's] tariffs is very manageable for Europe… the much bigger question here is not economic but security and foreign policy.\"The EU cannot afford not to react.\"Trust in US security guaranteesBut on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared less than impressed.Speaking in Davos, he painted a picture of a US president with his mind set: \"The president is looking at Greenland as a strategic asset for the United States. We are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to anyone else.\"European tariff retaliation would be \"unwise\", he warned. And here Europe feels stuck. Damned if it takes action. Damned if it doesn't.Some in Europe worry that if they are now more confrontational with Trump, they risk alienating the US even further.And the brutal truth is: Europe needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security. Despite pledging more defence-spending, Europe is still heavily reliant on the US.Getty ImagesThe Danish Navy patrols near Nuuk, Greenland earlier this monthWhile also reiterating his support for Danish and Greenlandic sovereignty, Sir Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, was at pains to make that point on Monday, saying it was in the UK's \"national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence.\"Our nuclear deterrence is our foremost weapon. A deterrent when it comes to securing the safety of everybody in the United Kingdom is my primary duty and that requires us to have a good relationship with the United States.\"But, if Europe continues to try to \"manage\" president Trump, rather than stand up to him, when he is threatening the sovereignty of his fellow Nato ally (Denmark), and brandishing economic sanctions over other allies if they support Copenhagen, then the continent risks looking seriously weak.ShutterstockIt's in the UK's 'national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence,' Sir Keir Starmer has saidOn X on Monday the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas wrote, \"We have no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground\".As a former prime minister of Estonia, a country that fears the looming shadow of an expansionist Russia, she is keen to demonstrate to Moscow that Europe can - and will - bare its teeth, if pushed.\"Europeans can't shy away anymore,\" Tara Varma told me. She's an expert in security and geopolitics at think tank, German Marshall Fund.\"They tried personal diplomacy alone [with Donald Trump] over the last year, in order to try and tie him into Europe's collective defence and guaranteeing Ukraine's security after a ceasefire with Russia,\" she said.But if he can suddenly turn around (as he just has), linking economic and security issues and threatening Nato, if he doesn't get his way over a certain issue, then, she says, how much trust can Europe ultimately put in US security guarantees under this administration?\"Putin and the Board of PeaceWatching all this from the sidelines is not only Russia, but China. In their eyes the West - traditionally with the US and Europe tightly-knit at its core, dominant for decades in global politics - is now unravelling.The world is increasingly dominated by a number of big powers, including Russia and China, but also India, Saudi Arabia and, to an extent, Brazil.China hopes Donald Trump's apparent fickleness with his allies may make Beijing appear a more stable, reliable partner and drive more international trade its way.Canada, which President Trump had threatened to make the 51st state of the US, has just agreed to a limited trade deal with Beijing. It's trying to reduce its exposure to Washington.AFP via GettyThe Kremlin has said that Vladimir Putin was invited to join the Board of PeaceThe US president has also shown little regard for multilateral institutions like Nato and the United Nations set up by western powers after the second world war, to manage global order.Some point to the Board of Peace that President Trump is now establishing, and that he reportedly wants to stage a signing ceremony for this Thursday in Davos. Many world leaders and leading business figures are attending the conference.The Board is ostensibly designed to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza after Israel's devastating two year offensive, aimed at destroying Hamas following its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.But the Board's charter calls for \"a more nimble and effective international peace-building body\", suggesting its remit would be far wider, possibly to rival the UN.AFP via Getty ImagesFrance does not plan to accept an invitation that it has received to join the Board of Peace, according to a sourceThat's how France's President sees it. A source close to Emmanuel Macron issued a statement on Monday saying that France did not plan to accept an invitation that, \"along with many countries\", it had received to join the Board of Peace.\"The [Board's] Charter... raises major questions, particularly with regard to respect for the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question under any circumstances,\" the statement reads.The Kremlin said on Monday that Vladimir Putin had also been asked to join the Board, suggesting that Trump is keen to maintain ties with the Russian president, despite Moscow's four-year long assault on Ukraine and its failure so far to accept a US-backed peace plan.Questions have been raised too about Trump's overarching role on the Board, and his demand that world leaders pay $1 billion for permanent membership.More from InDepthBut Tara Varma insists that the Peace Board isn't about peace. \"How can it be, if you invite leaders like Putin to be part of it?\"Trump wants to be seen as a peacemaker. He wants the headlines, but without doing the hard graft to lay the groundwork needed for peace to be durable. His is more of a hit and run strategy.\"He can't replace multilateral institutions like the UN that have been around for 80 years.\"Relations are strained but not brokenPerhaps, though, President Trump, with his flouting of decades-old international norms, is shaking some of these multilateral institutions up a bit, pushing or even forcing them to modernise and become more relevant.The membership of the UN security council should arguably be less western-centric, and more representative of changes in global power structures.Nato's European members have admitted they ought to be paying more for their own defence. Trump is not the first US president to say that they should, though he's far blunter.It was after he threatened that the US would no longer defend nations that didn't pay their way, that all Nato members except Spain agreed to dramatically increase security spending.Back to Greenland, polls suggest 55% of Americans don't want to buy the island and 86% oppose a military takeover by the US. Denmark and other European powers have been lobbying lawmakers on Capitol Hill to persuade them that Greenlandic and Danish sovereignty must be protected.Getty ImagesAsked if he was prepared to use force to seize Greenland, President Trump said, \"No comment\", sending chills down the spine of many GreenlandersTransatlantic relations aren't broken yet, though they are damaged. Donald Trump is still picking up the phone to his pal, the Italian premier, Giorgia Meloni, to Starmer, and to Nato's Secretary General Mark Rutte. Lines of communication are still open.Ultimately, though, if Europeans want to try to cut through with Donald Trump, they will have to stick together.Not only the EU's disparate member states, not just Nato: all countries together. And the UK, with its closer relationship with the US will be key here.But Europe's leaders are torn between wanting to do what they see as right internationally, and their own domestic concerns. If a full-blown transatlantic trade war were to break out, that would hurt their voters.All singing from the same sheet over Greenland for any length of time, is going to be tough.Top picture credits: Getty Images and Getty/Bloomberg/LightrocketBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "2 days agoLyse DoucetChief international correspondentWatch: BBC asks Trump if breakup of Nato is price he is willing to pay for GreenlandOn day one, he put the world on notice. \"Nothing will stand in our way,\" President Donald Trump declared, to thunderous applause, as he ended his inauguration speech in a cold Washington winter on this day last year, at the start of his second term. Did the world fail to take enough notice?Tucked into his speech was a mention of the 19th Century doctrine of \"manifest destiny\" – the idea that the US was divinely ordained to expand its territory across the continent, spreading American ideals.At that moment, the Panama Canal was in his sights. \"We're taking it back,\" Trump announced.Now that same declaration, expressed with absolute resolve, is directed at Greenland. \"We have to have it,\" is the new mantra. It's a rude awakening in a moment fraught with grave risk.US history is littered with consequential and controversial American invasions, occupations, and covert operations to topple rulers and regimes. But, in the past century, no American president has threatened to seize the land of a longtime ally and rule it against their people's will.No US leader has so brutally broken political norms and threatened long-standing alliances which have underpinned the world order since the end of World War Two.There's little doubt that old rules are being broken, with impunity.Trump is now being described as possibly the US's most \"transformative\" president - cheered by supporters at home and abroad, alarm among others in capitals the world over, and a watchful silence in Moscow and Beijing.\"It's a shift toward a world without rules, where international law is trampled underfoot, and where the only law which seems to matter is the strongest with imperial ambitions resurfacing,\" was French President Emmanuel Macron's stark warning on the stage at the Davos Economic Forum, without directly mentioning Trump by name.EPA/ShutterstockFrench President Emmanuel Macron spoke at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday but avoided any direct mention of TrumpThere is mounting concern over a possible painful trade war, even worry in some circles that the 76-year-old Nato military alliance could now be at risk if, in the worst case scenario, the US commander-in-chief tries to take Greenland by force.Trump's defenders are doubling down in support of his \"America First\" agenda, against the post-war multilateral order.When asked on BBC Newshour whether seizing Greenland would violate the UN charter, Republican congressman Randy Fine said: \"I think the United Nations has abjectly failed in being an entity that supports peace in the world and, frankly, whatever they think, probably doing the opposite's the right thing.\"Fine introduced a bill called \"Greenland Annexation and Statehood Act\" in Congress last week.How do America's anxious allies respond, when it seems nothing will stand in Trump's way?Many phrases have peppered this past year of diplomatic contortions over how best to deal with the US's unpredictable president and commander-in-chief.\"We need to take him seriously but not literally,\" comes from those who insist this can all be sorted out through dialogue.It's worked, but only to a point, on trying to forge a united response with Europe to Russia's blistering war in Ukraine. Trump often veers, from one week to the next, from espousing positions close to Russia's, then tilting towards Ukraine, then bolting back into Russia's orbit again.\"He's a real estate mogul,\" says those who see in Trump's maximalist positions his deal-making tactics from his New York property days. There's an echo of that in his repeated threats of military action against Iran – although it's clear military options are still on his now crowded table.AFP via Getty ImagesTrump (left) was seen chatting to Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte at a Nato summit at the Hague in JuneHe doesn't talk like a traditional politician,\" explains his top diplomat, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio when he is repeatedly questioned about Trump's tactics. \"He says and then he does,\" is his highest praise for his president against what he derides as the dismal record of previous incumbents.Rubio has been one of the principal voices trying to backpedal Trump's threats on Greenland, underlining that he wants to buy this vast strategic ice sheet, not invade it. He pointed out that Trump has been exploring options to purchase the world's largest island, to counter threats from China and Russia, since his first term in office.But there is no denying Trump's bully tactics, his contempt for collective action, his belief that might is right.\"He is a man of transactions and brute power, mafia style power,\" says Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of the Economist magazine.\"He doesn't see the benefit of alliances, he doesn't see the idea of America as an idea, a set of values; he doesn't give two hoots about that.\"And he doesn't hide it.\"Nato is not feared by Russia or China at all. Not even a little bit,\" Trump told the New York Times in a wide-ranging interview earlier this month. \"We're tremendously feared.\"If security was the issue, the US already has forces on the ground in Greenland and under a 1951 agreement could send in more troops and open more bases.\"I need to own it,\" is how Trump flatly puts it.And he often makes it clear, \"I like to win.\" There's a growing body of proof that's what it is about.His policy back flips in the past year have been baffling.ReutersMerchandise opposing a US takeover of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, have appeared in shops in CopenhagenIn the Saudi capital Riyadh in May, we watched how his major speech on his first foreign trip of his second term met a rapturous reception.Trump took aim at the American \"interventionists\" whom he excoriated for having \"wrecked far more nations than they built... in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves.\"In June when Israel attacked Iran, Trump reportedly warned Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to put his diplomacy at risk with his military threats against Tehran. By the end of the week, when he saw Israel's success in assassinating top nuclear scientists and security chiefs, Trump exclaimed: \"I think it's been excellent.\"\"Sane-washing\" was the phrase coined months ago by Edward Luce of the Financial Times to describe the world's polite portrayals of Trump, the succession of leaders landing at his door with glittering gifts and gilded praise to try to win him over to their side.\"Trump's apologists – a more numerous crowd than true believers - work round the clock to sane-wash his policies into something coherent,\" Luce wrote in his latest column.ReutersTrump met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in Riyadh in May 2025It was on full display last October when leaders the world over were summoned to join him at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh to celebrate his ringing declaration that \"at long last we have peace in the Middle East\" for the first time in \"3,000 years.\"The first significant phase of his peace plan had brought about a desperately needed ceasefire in Gaza and the urgent release of Israeli hostages. It was Trump's muscular diplomacy that forced Netanyahu, as well as Hamas, to agree to it. It was a major breakthrough only Trump could achieve. But it wasn't – sadly - the dawn of peace. No-one there said the quiet part out loud.Last year Trump's approach was framed as manifest destiny. This year it's the early 19th Century Monroe Doctrine now updated, since the Venezuela invasion, as the \"Donroe Doctrine.\" President Trump now owns it, bolstered by his fervent backers on his team, with his belief that America can act at will in its backyard, and beyond, to protect American interests.ReutersIn October, Benjamin Netanyahu called Trump the \"greatest friend\" Israel had ever had in the White HouseSometimes he is called an isolationist, sometimes an interventionist. But there's always that slogan which returned him to power - Make America Great Again.And his letter to Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre highlighted his obsessive pique over not winning this year's Nobel Peace Prize. Trump informed Støre: \"I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.\"\"It's a good day to have a Nordic temperament,\" Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide diplomatically remarked to me when I asked about this moment. Norway has been calm, with ice-hard firmness, in its defence of Greenland and Denmark and collective security in the Arctic.European responses still stretch across this slippery political ice.Macron has vowed to launch the EU's \"trade bazooka\" of counter-tariffs and restricting access to the EU's lucrative market.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, one of the American president's closest European allies, has vaguely spoken of a \"problem of understanding and miscommunication.\"UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has strongly and publicly defended Greenland's territorial integrity but wants to protect the strong personal bond he's built over the past year by avoiding retaliatory tariffs.ReutersSir Keir Starmer has maintained a largely cordial relationship with Trump since he started his second term as presidentThe gloves are off for Trump as he posts the private messages he's receiving from leaders using the old tools of statecraft to try to keep him on side.\"Let us have a dinner in Paris together on Thursday before you go back to the US,\" suggested the French president who also queried, in the midst of praise for other foreign policy successes, \"I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland\".\"Can't wait to see you\", wrote Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, who once called Trump \"daddy\" for his forceful handling of the Iran-Israel 12-day war last year.Nato boss commends 'daddy' Trump's handling of Israel-Iran conflictRutte, and others, have credited Trump's blunt threats for forcing Nato members to significantly increase their defence spending in recent years. Trump's warnings, going back to his first term, accelerated a trend called for by previous US presidents and started by Nato members themselves in the shadow of Russian threats.On the other side of the Atlantic, the country which has long lived in America's shadow has been trying to forge a different path forward, albeit with challenges of their own.\"We have to take the world as it is, not the way we want it to be,\" was the candid reflection of Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney on his trip to China last week.It was the first visit by a Canadian leader to Beijing since 2017, after years of sharp tension, and it sent a clear signal of this fast changing world.Watch: Canada-China trade relationship \"more predictable\" than with US, says CarneyTrump's astonishing threat to annex his neighbour to the north surfaced again this week in a post on social media which showed the western hemisphere, including Canada and Greenland, covered in stars and stripes. Canadians know there's still a risk they could be next.Carney, the former central banker, rose to Canada's highest office last year buoyed by Canadians' belief he was the best prepared to take on Trump. He responded \"dollar for dollar\" from the start, imposing retaliatory tariffs – until it became too painful for the much smaller Canadian economy, which sends more than 70% of its trade south of its border.When Carney took to the stage at Davos on Tuesday, he also focused on this jarring juncture.\"American hegemony in particular, helped provide public goods, open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security and support for frameworks for resolving disputes,\" he said, adding bluntly: \"We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.\"On Wednesday Trump will speak from that same podium with the world watching.Asked by the New York Times this month what could stop him, Trump replied: \"My own morality. My own mind. It's the only thing that can stop me.\"That's what lies behind an armada of allies now seeking to persuade, flatter, force him – to change his mind.This time, it's not certain they will succeed.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "1 day agoJames Waterhousein Córdoba, SpainBBC/Moose CampbellYamilei's brother-in-law Victor was among the victims of Sunday night's crashEduardo Morán, a doctor at Córdoba's Reina Sofía Hospital, suspected it was serious.He and his wife, also a medic, had been asked to head to work after reports that two high speed trains had collided nearby.\"We were preparing different parts of the hospital,\" he recalls. \"Not just the emergency room, but the intensive care unit, all the surgery theatres and the regular floor. Everybody was there.\"As the patients arrived, their injuries ranged from scratches to missing limbs. Staff prioritised who to treat. Some were operated on, others monitored.Eduardo had never seen such an influx of casualties in his 20-year career, and yet the hospital was not overwhelmed.\"We were expecting more,\" he says. \"Unfortunately, there were a lot of people who didn't make it and died on the railway.\"Social MediaAmong the victims was María del Carmen Abril, returning from a surprise birthday partyIn dense woodland 36 miles from Córdoba lies the tangled wreckage of the two trains that collided on Sunday evening.A gap in the straight section of track is thought to be what investigators are focusing on.At least 43 people lost their lives here, and as sniffer dogs weave between the empty seats and shattered windows, there is still a hunger to unearth answers as to what caused Spain's worst rail crash in more than a decade.As officials called for patience, news broke of a second derailment in almost as many days.Unlike Sunday night's disaster, the train that crashed near Barcelona was not a high-speed model, and the accident involved a wall that collapsed onto the track in heavy rain.Nevertheless, it has led to the Spanish train drivers' union calling a strike over the \"unacceptable constant deterioration of the railway\".For the families and friends of those missing and killed in southern Spain, these events have only added to their unanswered questions.BBC/Moose CampbellJose Manuel Muñoz lost his friend Abril in Sunday's high-speed rail crashThroughout Saturday afternoon and into the night in Córdoba, Jose Manuel Muñoz and his friends were holding a surprise 50th birthday party for María del Carmen Abril, a teacher.The party was barely over when Abril, as she is known, made her way back north to Madrid. She thanked her hosts on their WhatsApp group, and they later frantically replied to see if she was OK.Abril was sitting on one of the carriages that came off the tracks into an oncoming train. Her death was confirmed the next day.Carlos Alvarez/Getty ImagesAn Iryo train was the first to derail at Adamuz, crashing into an oncoming train\"It's very difficult to explain the contrast of emotions,\" says Muñoz, sitting in the tranquil surroundings of Córdoba's Jardines de la Victoria, a park next to his workshop where he makes picture frames.\"We spent one day celebrating life with our friend, then there were two days of uncertainty, without knowing anything about what happened to her, then we get the confirmation that she's dead.\"He describes Abril as a \"lovely, generous, affectionate person who loved flowers and was always trying to solve other people's problems\".And yet Muñoz does not blame anyone for her death; instead, he puts it down to bad luck.Under the low winter sun and next to the city's bull ring is Córdoba's Civic Centre. Outside are two makeshift tents where the families of the missing give DNA samples in the hope their relatives can at least be identified.BBC/Marianne BaisnéeYamilei shows a picture of her brother-in-law, Victor Luis TeránBecause of a last-minute change in travel plans, Jamilet's brother-in law, Victor Luis Terán, took an earlier train and became caught up in the crash as he travelled south from Madrid to Huelva.It was not until Tuesday night that confirmation came that Victor, a Bolivian national, was among the 43 victims.Yamilei is looking for answers: \"That's all we want. Because we can't do it any more.\"The truth she seeks is likely to take weeks to arrive, and official calls for patience have only been hampered by a devastating three days on Spain's rail network.Additional reporting by Marianne Baisnée and Marta Jimenez",

    "body": "20 hours agoThomas MackintoshandRachel HaganThe US military has begun the transfer up to 7,000 Islamic State (IS) group detainees from prisons in north-eastern Syria to Iraq, as Syria's new government takes control of areas long run autonomously by Kurdish-led forces.US Central Command (Centcom) said it had already moved 150 IS fighters from Hassakeh province to a \"secure location\" in Iraq.It said the move aimed to prevent prisoners breaking out and regrouping.The transfer follows a ceasefire agreement that has brought much of Syria's north east under Damascus control, after the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) withdrew from key areas, including detention sites holding thousands of IS suspects and their relatives.CENTCOM said its commander Admiral Brad Cooper discussed the transfers with Syria's new president Ahmed al-Sharaa, stressing the need for Syrian forces to uphold the ceasefire and avoid any action that could interfere with what he described as an \"orderly and secure transfer\" of detainees.Rights group Reprieve warned that detainees transferred to Iraq could face torture and execution and urged the UK government to establish whether any British nationals were among those being moved.The charity said it believed there were no more than 10 British men held in the prisons, though exact numbers were unclear. Around 55 to 60 British nationals, most of them children, remain detained across camps and prisons in the region, it said.Despite the ceasefire there have been fresh clashes, with Syria's defence ministry saying seven soldiers were killed in a drone attack in Hassakeh on Wednesday, describing the incident a violation of the ceasefire.The SDF denied carrying out the strike and accused Damascus of also launching attacks, including near the town of Kobane on the Turkish border.The government and SDF had earlier blamed each other over the escape of suspected IS fighters from an SDF-run prison in Shaddadi, in southern Hassakeh.Syria's interior ministry said on Monday night that its special forces and army soldiers had entered the town following \"the escape of around 120 [IS] terrorists\" from the prison. It said security forces later recaptured 81 of the fugitives.The SDF said it had lost control of the prison following clashes with \"Damascus-affiliated factions\", warning of a \"serious security catastrophe\".SDF spokesman Farhad Shami said around 1,500 IS members may have escaped during the clashes, according to Reuters news agency. The SDF also accused government forces of attacking al-Aqtan prison, north of the city of Raqqa, which is also holding IS members and leaders.The SDF helped US-led forces defeat IS during Syria's 13-year civil war and, backed by the US, went on to jail around 12,000 IS members, including thousands of foreigners, while detaining tens of thousands of relatives in camps across the north east.However US special envoy Tom Barrack has said the US alliance with the SDF had \"largely expired\" and that his country was currently focused on securing IS detention facilities and facilitating talks between the SDF and al-Sharaa's government.\"This moment offers a pathway to full integration into a unified Syrian state with citizenship rights, cultural protections, and political participation - long denied under Bashar al-Assad's regime,\" he wrote on X.",

    "body": "Photos leaked to BBC show faces of hundreds killed in Iran's brutal protest crackdown1 day agoMerlyn Thomas,correspondent, BBC Verify,Shayan Sardarizadeh,senior journalist, BBC VerifyandGhoncheh Habibiazad,senior journalistBBCWarning: this story contains graphic content which some readers might find distressingHundreds of photos revealing the faces of those killed during Iran's violent crackdown on anti-government protests have been leaked to BBC Verify.The pictures, which are too graphic to show without blurring, reveal the bloodied, swollen and bruised faces of at least 326 victims - including 18 women. The images, displayed in a south Tehran mortuary, are one of the only ways families have been able to identify their dead loved ones.Many of the victims were too disfigured to be identified, and 69 people had been labelled in Persian as John or Jane Doe, suggesting their identity was unknown when the photo was taken. Only 28 of the victims had labels with clearly visible names in the photos.Labels on more than 100 victims, who had their date of death recorded, showed that date as 9 January, one of the deadliest nights for protesters in Tehran so far.The city's streets were set on fire during clashes with security forces, with protesters chanting slogans against the supreme leader and the Islamic Republic. It followed a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late shah. The leaked photos provide a small snapshot of the thousands believed to have been killed at the hands of the Iranian state.Getty ImagesProtesters on a street in Tehran on 9 January BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the government's violence against those who oppose it.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has publicly acknowledged several thousand people have been killed but blamed the US, Israel and those he described as \"seditionists\".Despite the blackout entering its third week, a small number of people have managed to get some information out.Hundreds of close-up images of victims taken from inside the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre were leaked to BBC Verify.We analysed 392 photos of victims and were able to identify 326 people - some had multiple pictures taken of them from different angles. Sources claimed the true number of dead at the mortuary ran into the thousands. One source, who we are not naming for their safety, told us they weren't prepared for the level of devastation they encountered inside the mortuary complex, and said they saw victims ranging from as young as 12 or 13 to 60 and 70-year-olds. \"It was just too much,\" they said.Amid the chaos inside the mortuary, family members and friends were huddled together around a screen, we were told. They were trying to identify their loved ones while hundreds of images of the dead flicked across the screen. Crowds of anti-government protesters in TehranThe slideshow lasted for hours, they said, adding that many of the victims' injuries were so severe they could not be identified. One man's face was so swollen his eyes were barely visible. Another man still had a breathing tube in his mouth, suggesting he died after receiving medical treatment.Some victims were so badly injured that their families asked to see the pictures again and to zoom in on their faces to make sure it was really them, we were told. At other times people recognised their loved ones instantly and were seen collapsing to the floor, screaming.Many photos showed unzipped body bags with papers laid close to their faces, identifying them by name, ID number or date of death. In some cases, we were told, the only identifier was a bank card laid on top of a body bag – the victims' last remaining possession.BBC Verify has separately corroborated videos from the same mortuary that demonstrate the violence perpetrated against protesters. One shows the body of what appears to be a child, while another shows a man with a clear gunshot wound in the middle of his head. Both videos are too distressing to show. Some Iranians have been posting the names of victims killed by security forces when they manage to connect to the internet through Starlink or even using networks from neighbouring countries, though these opportunities are incredibly rare.We checked the names of victims identified in the mortuary against social media posts reporting the names of the dead and found five matches, but are not revealing the names as we cannot contact the victims' families.BBC Verify has tracked the spread of anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran since they first erupted on 28 December through verified video, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely much higher.The few images that people have managed to upload through Starlink show burnt-out cars left in the streets, while verified videos recorded rounds of gunshots fired around Tehran during protests. The internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to document the full extent of the death toll from the protests. However, US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has placed its current estimate at more than 4,000 deaths.",

    "body": "Shock and confusion as Spain struggles for answers after deadly train crash1 day agoGuy Hedgecoein Adamuz, southern SpainReutersSpain's King Felipe (far right) visited the crash site with Queen Letizia on TuesdaySunday's high-speed train crash in southern Spain, the worst in over a decade, has been a devastating tragedy for the country, with the loss of at least 42 lives.And amid the grief, many are asking what could have caused such a failure on one of Europe's most admired rail systems.The CIAF rail investigatory commission has started analysing why a train travelling north from Málaga was derailed on a straight section of the route, causing it to collide with an oncoming train, which was also derailed. The Spanish government has described the accident as \"extremely strange\".Three bodies already located in the wreckage were recovered on Tuesday afternoon, and a 42nd victim was also found at the crash site near Adamuz.The shock felt in this sleepy town has been compounded by confusion at how a rail route that ran efficiently for so long suddenly failed.After its inauguration in 1992, Spain's high-speed rail, or AVE, network was seen as a symbol of the country's modernisation. Built with EU funds, it provided a state-of-the-art transport system that was fast, efficient and safe.A derailment near Santiago de Compostela in 2013 that killed 80 people was not part of the AVE network, although that train was travelling at high speed. Sunday's collision, however, took place on the oldest AVE route, that which connects Madrid with Andalusia.Watch: At the scene of Spain's worst rail disaster in over a decadeSeveral officials, including the president of Renfe, the national rail operator, Álvaro Fernández Heredia, said that human error was almost certainly not the cause of the accident, given that neither train was travelling at an excessive speed. Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska insisted that sabotage was not a possible cause.Inevitably, investigators are looking closely at the train that derailed. Owned by Italian firm Iryo, it was manufactured in 2022. Transport Minister Óscar Puente said that carriage number six of the train was going to be examined closely, because it was the first to derail and it offered \"many pieces of the puzzle\".EPAGrieving Spaniards want answers about what caused the deadly crashHowever, investigators are also examining the section of track where the derailment occurred and intend to analyse parts of it in a laboratory. The revelation that part of the track at the crash site was broken has encouraged speculation that this might be the culprit. The government has been keen to play down such conclusions, pointing out that the track may have been damaged by the force of the collision.Some observers have drawn attention to possible underlying factors on the network. It has emerged that rail infrastructure administrator Adif drew attention to eight technical issues on the line near where the accident happened on social media over the last year. Most of those issues were related to signalling, and last summer one was discussed in the Senate.Adif has reduced the speed limit for the AVE along a 150km (93 mile) stretch between Madrid and Barcelona, due to concerns about the state of the line. The new limit along that section is 160km/h, nearly half the previous limit.Since the collision, many social media users have flagged posts from the past in which they had complained about uncomfortable movement while travelling on AVE trains. One user filmed the interior of a train vigorously vibrating in December, commenting that it had caused them to \"fear for my safety and that of my daughter\".In August 2025, train drivers' union Semaf issued a communiqué warning that the state of a number of AVE lines was causing \"a lack of comfort and reliability\" for those travelling. It called for a reduction in speed limits in order to prevent further degradation of the infrastructure and \"to guarantee the safety of workers and travellers\".As a result of Sunday's crash, and the separate derailment of a Rodalies train which killed a driver near Barcelona on Tuesday, Semaf has called a strike. Such grievances might suggest that Spain's high-speed rail network is badly in need of an overhaul. However, the government counters that last year the section of track where the accident took place was renovated, at a cost of €49m (£42m), as part of a broader €700m investment to update the Madrid-Andalusia network in recent years.\"When we find the answer, with absolute transparency we will make it known to Spaniards,\" Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, said of the investigation, as he declared three day's mourning during his visit to Adamuz.That answer could have enormous significance for the future of Spain's renowned rail system.",

    "body": "Oldest cave painting of red claw hand could rewrite human creativity timeline1 day agoPallab GhoshScience CorrespondentA stencilled outline of a hand found on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi is the world's oldest known cave painting, researchers say.It shows a red outline of a hand whose fingers were reworked, researchers say, to create a claw-like motif which indicates an early leap in symbolic imagination.The painting has been dated to at least 67,800 years ago – around 1,100 years before the previous record, a controversial hand stencil in Spain.The find also strengthens the argument that our species, Homo sapiens, had reached the wider Australia–New Guinea landmass, known as Sahul, by around 15,000 years earlier than some researchers argue.Over the past decade, a series of discoveries on Sulawesi has overturned the old idea that art and abstract thinking in our species burst suddenly into life in Ice Age Europe and spread from there.Cave art is seen as a key marker of when humans began to think in truly abstract, symbolic ways – the kind of imagination that underpins language, religion and science.Early paintings and engravings show people not just reacting to the world, but representing it, sharing stories and identities in a way no other species is known to have done.Professor Adam Brumm of Griffiths University in Australia, who co-led the project, told BBC News, that the latest discovery, published in the journal Nature, adds to the emerging view that there was no awakening for humanity in Europe. Instead, creativity was innate to our species, the evidence for which stretches back to Africa, where we evolved.\"When I went to university in the mid to late 90s, that's what we were taught – the creative explosion in humans occurred in a small part of Europe. But now we're seeing traits of modern human behaviour, including narrative art in Indonesia, which makes that Eurocentric argument very hard to sustain\".The oldest Spanish cave art is a red hand stencil in Maltravieso cave in Western Spain, dated to be at least 66,700 years old - though this is controversial and some experts don't think it to be that old. In 2014, hand stencils and animal figures dating back at least 40,000 years were found in Sulawesi, followed by a hunting scene that is at least 44,000 year old, and then a narrative pig and human painting dated to at least 51,200 years ago. Each step pushed sophisticated image making further back in time, according to Professor Maxime Aubert of Griffiths University.\"We started with minimum ages of at least 40,000 years, the same time as in Europe, but by getting closer to the pigment we've pushed the rock art in Sulawesi back by at least another 28,000 years\".The latest discovery is from a limestone cave called Liang Metanduno on Muna, a small island off south eastern Sulawesi. It has been spray-painted: an ancient graffiti artist pressed their hand flat against the cave wall, then blew or spat a mouthful of pigment around it so that, when they pulled the hand away, a negative outline was left behind on the rock.One fragmentary hand stencil there is overlain by thin mineral crusts that, when analysed, was found to have a minimum age of 67,800 years, making it the oldest reliably dated cave art anywhere in the world.Crucially, the artist did more than simply spray pigment around a hand pressed to the wall, the researchers say.Ahdi Agus OktavianaMore recent elongated hand stencils found elsewhere in Suluwesi shows how prevalent the red claw image was among these ancient artists.After the original stencil was made, the outlines of the fingers were carefully altered – narrowed and elongated to make it look more claw-like; a creative transformation that Brumm argues is \"a very us thing to do\".  He notes that there was no evidence of that experimentation in any of the art produced by our sister species, Neanderthals, in their cave paintings in Spain around 64,000 years ago. Even that is hotly contested because some researchers question the dating method.Until this latest discovery on Muna, all the paintings in Sulawesi had come from the Maros Pangkep karst in the island's south west. The fact that this much older stencil turns up on the opposite side of Sulawesi, on a separate satellite island, suggests that making images on cave walls was not a local experiment but deeply embedded in the cultures that spread across the region.Brumm says years of fieldwork by Indonesian colleagues have revealed \"hundreds of new rock art sites\" across remote areas, with some caves used repeatedly over tens of thousands of years. At Liang Metanduno, other, much younger paintings on the same panel – some produced as late as about 20,000 years ago – show that this single cave was a focus for artistic activity stretching over at least 35,000 years.Because Sulawesi lies on the northern sea route between mainland Asia and ancient Sahul, the dates have direct implications for assessing when the ancestors of Aboriginal Australians first arrived.For years, the mainstream view – based largely on DNA studies and most archaeological sites – was that Homo sapiens first reached the ancient Australia–New Guinea landmass, Sahul, about 50,000 years ago. But with firm evidence that Homo sapiens were settled on Sulawesi and making complex symbolic art at least 67,800 years ago, it makes it much more likely that controversial archaeological evidence for humans in northern Australia by about 65,000 years is correct, according to Adhi Agus Oktaviana, of the Indonesia's national research and innovation Agency (BRIN).\"It is very likely that the people who made these paintings in Sulawesi were part of the broader population that would later spread through the region and ultimately reach Australia.\"Many archaeologists once argued for a European \"big bang\" of the mind because cave paintings, carvings, ornaments and new stone tools all seem to appear together in France and Spain about 40,000 years ago, soon after Homo sapiens arrived there. Spectacular Ice Age cave art in places like Altamira and El Castillo encouraged the idea that symbolism and art switched on almost overnight in Ice Age Europe. Since then, engraved ochre, beads and abstract marks from South African sites such as Blombos Cave, some 70,000–100,000 years old, have shown that symbolic behaviour was already established in Africa long before.Along with very old figurative and narrative paintings from Sulawesi, a new consensus is being shaped; that there was a much deeper and more widespread story of creativity, Aubert told BBC News.\"What it suggests is that humans would have had that capacity for a very long time, at least when they left Africa – but probably before that\".Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "Japan has suspended operations at the world's largest nuclear power plant, hours after its restart, its operator has said.An alarm sounded \"during reactor-start-up procedures\" at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa north-west of Tokyo but the reactor remained \"stable\", Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) spokesperson Takashi Kobayashi said.Reactor number six restarted on Wednesday a day later than planned due to an alarm malfunction - the first at the plant to be turned on since the 2011 Fukushima disaster.Japan shut down all of its 54 reactors after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake triggered a meltdown at its Fukushima plant 15 years ago, causing one of the worst nuclear disasters in history.At the time, radiation leakage from the plant forced more than 150,000 people to evacuate their homes. Many have not returned despite assurances it is now safe.Following the suspension of reactor number six on Thursday, Kobayashi said it was \"stable and there is no radioactive impact outside\".The reactor was initially set to start on Tuesday, but was pushed back due to a technical issue. It is due to begin operating commercially next month.Kobayashi said Tepco was \"currently investigating the cause\" of the incident and did not say when operations would resume. The seventh reactor at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is not expected to be turned back on until 2030, while the other five could be decommissioned.This would leave the plant with far less capacity than it once had when all seven reactors were operational.Reactor number six was given the green light to restart despite safety concerns from local residents.A small crowd of people gathered outside Tepco's headquarters to protest last week, while hundreds gathered outside the Niigata prefectural assembly in December.Japan was an early adopter of nuclear power - before 2011, nuclear accounted for nearly 30% of its electricity and the country planned to get that up to 50% by 2030.After it was forced to shut them all down in the wake of the Fukushima disaster, it has spent the past decade attempting to revive the plants as part of its goal to reach net zero emissions by 2050.Since 2015, Japan has restarted 15 out of its 33 operable reactors.An earlier version of this story said the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant was in Tokyo and has been corrected to say it is north-west of Tokyo.",

    "body": "South Africa's Police Minister Firoz Cachalia has said that the security forces are not yet able to defeat deadly criminal gangs, in a stark admission that underscores the scale of the country's crime crisis. Gang violence, alongside robberies, accounts for many murders in South Africa, which has one of the world's highest homicide rates.Cachalia said gang violence had become increasingly complex, especially in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces, requiring new strategies beyond traditional policing.\"I do not believe that we are currently in a position to defeat these gangs,\" the minister told journalists on Wednesday. South Africa, the continent's most industrialised nation, has long struggled with entrenched organised crime. Many people in South Africa own licensed firearms for personal protection, but there are many more illegal guns in circulation.Police data shows that an average of 63 people were killed each day between April and September last year.Speaking after his visit to crime-infested Nelson Mandela Bay in Eastern Cape, Cachalia said criminal gangs were on a \"killing spree\" in the two provinces. \"We had a discussion about the problem of organised crime in the Eastern Cape, including extortion rackets, gang violence and related issues,\" said the minister.  \"I indicated that this is a grave problem throughout the country, that these cartels wield significant wealth and power, and that this is deeply concerning,\" he added. Despite the creation of an anti-gang unit in 2019, Cachalia said gangsters seemed to be winning the war.\"Establishing gang units from time to time is an ad hoc response to a growing problem. I really don't think that we should be approaching this matter in a point-scoring way.\"He said South African police were doing their best to fight the violence \"but the problem is a growing one. That is my view\". His visit comes months after Nelson Mandela Bay was hit by a wave of killings.A deadly spike in violence hit the area in the latter half of last year, leaving 118 people dead between August and December, a local prevention group said.The violence has continued into the new year, with around 40 people killed across the region in January, local media reported. There are about three million legally held firearms in South Africa, but there are at least the same number of unlicensed weapons in circulation in the country, which has a population of 63 million, according to statistics cited by Gideon Joubert from the South African Gunowners' Association.Last month, 11 people were killed in a mass shooting linked to illegal mining turf wars near Johannesburg. The shooting occurred just two weeks after another attack at the Saulsville Hostel in the capital Pretoria, where 11 people, including a three-year-old child, were killed.In another incident last May, gunmen killed eight customers at a tavern in the south-eastern city of Durban.President Cyril Ramaphosa has promised stronger law enforcement action and increased police deployment to tackle the gang violence in the country.

    "body": "5 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterLatin America editor, BBC News OnlineRafael Tudares, the son-in-law of Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo González, has been released from prison, his wife has said, more than a year after he was detained as part of a crackdown on Maduro government critics and their relatives.Mariana González said her husband had returned home after \"380 days of unjust and arbitrary detention\".Tudares is one of more than 150 detainees who have been released since the US military seized Venezuelan leader, Nicolás Maduro, in a nighttime raid and took him to New York to stand trial on drug-trafficking charges.An NGO lobbying for the release of Venezuelan political prisoners warns that 777 still remain behind bars.Tension within the country remains high with Maduro's former vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, now in power having been sworn in as the acting president.Her interim government has received the backing of US President Donald Trump, who has praised Rodríguez for agreeing to \"turn over\" up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil to the US.The release of political prisoners had been among the first things the Trump administration had pushed Venezuela's interim government to do.Just five days after the US raid, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly announced that \"an important number of people\" would be freed as \"a gesture of peace\".However, rights groups have denounced the slow pace of the releases and the fact that the number given by officials - 400 - falls far short of what they have been able to confirm. The NGO Foro Penal says it has so far only been able to verify the release of 151 political prisoners since 8 January, when the head of Venezuela's National Assembly announced that \"an important number of people\" would be freed as \"a gesture of peace\" following the US operation.Foro Penal has also said that many those released have not had the charges against them dropped, leaving them in legal limbo, and have been barred from speaking in public. Tudares's imprisonment was one of the emblematic cases of the repression which followed in the wake of Venezuela's 2024 presidential election.His father-in-law, González, became the main challenger of the incumbent Maduro after the well-known opposition leader María Corina Machado was barred from running.Fearing the Maduro government would resort to fraud to rig the result, González and Machado mobilised hundreds of people to act as observers at the polling stations and collect the tallies from the electronic voting machines. The electoral council, dominated by government loyalists, declared Maduro the winner but never provided the detailed voting tallies to back up its claim.The voting tallies collected by the observers deployed by the opposition and independently verified by the Carter Center, however, suggested that González had won by a landslide. Nevertheless, Maduro - who was firmly in control of the state institutions, including the armed forces and the police - was sworn in for another term in January 2025.In the run-up to his inauguration, many opposition leaders and activists were seized by the security forces in an attempt to stifle any dissent.Fearing arrest, González had sought refuge in the Dutch embassy as early as September 2024 and gone in to exile in Spain shortly afterwards.Three days before Maduro's inauguration, González's 46-year-old son-in-law - a lawyer who was not involved in politics - was seized by hooded men as he was taking his young children to see their ailing grandmother. For months, his family did not know where he was being held or on what grounds he had been seized.Last month, his wife said she had learned that he had been sentenced to 30 years in prison for \"terrorism and conspiracy\". She said her access was not allowed to choose a lawyer and had only been allowed to read the charges levelled against him on the day of his \"only hearing\".Mariana González told El Pais newspaper that she had been approached on at least three occasions by middlemen who told her that her husband would only be allowed to return to his family if her father renounced his cause. \"This has nothing to do with justice,\" she said at the time. \"Being the son-in-law of Edmundo González is not a crime,\" she added.Mariana González took to X to thank all of the people who had supported her in her fight for her husband's release. But she also reminded readers that there were still many families waiting for the release of their loved ones who, she said, had been \"forcibly disappeared, arbitrarily detained and unjustly locked up.Many of them have been holding vigils outside the main prisons in Venezuela in the hope that their relatives will be among those released in the wake of the US military raid.",

    "body": "Ugandan police have detained a lawmaker, and close ally of opposition leader Bobi Wine, for his alleged role in election-related violence last week.Muwanga Kivumbi, a deputy leader of Wine's National Unity Platform (NUP), is accused of organising attacks on a police station and a vote-tallying centre after their electoral loss, which the party denies.The police have said that seven people were killed in the incident, but the politician has given a different account, saying that 10 people were killed at his home as they waited for parliamentary election results.The Uganda Police Force said in a post on X on Thursday that Kivumbi would be \"arraigned before court in due course\".\"His arrest is in connection with recent incidents of political violence,\" it added.Kivumbi's arrest follows tensions after last week's elections in which President Yoweri Museveni was re-elected for a seventh term.During his victory speech over the weekend, Museveni warned opposition figures including Kivumbi of coordinated plans to attack polling stations.He said seven people were shot dead by police after groups of alleged opposition supporters, armed with machetes, attempted to carry out violent attacks in Butambala district outside the capital, Kampala.Wine, Museveni's closest challenger and who is in hiding after fleeing a raid on his house after the elections, has denounced the results as \"fake\", citing electoral fraud.He has also alleged that there was \"silent massacre\" under way and a crackdown targeting political activists.On Tuesday, he posted on social media that more than 100 people had been killed in election violence, without stating evidence.This came after Uganda's army chief Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, who is also Museveni's son and his potential successor, said the security forces had killed 22 opposition supporters during poll-related violence.Since the election, Ugandan authorities have reportedly arrested dozens of youths on various charges linked to election-related incidents in Kampala.Museveni first came to power as a rebel leader in 1986. He will have served for 45 years when the next term ends in 2031.Uganda has not witnessed a peaceful transfer of presidential power since independence.",

    "body": "Ghislaine Maxwell, the jailed associate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has agreed to testify under oath before the congressional committee investigating the federal government's handling of the Epstein files.Committee chairman James Comer, who is leading the investigation, says Maxwell will depose virtually on 9 February. Maxwell's legal team has previously said she would decline to answer questions under her constitutional right to remain silent unless she is granted legal immunity. Comer, previewing the deposition, said, \"her lawyers have been saying she is going to plead the Fifth,\" referring to the US Fifth Amendment right to decline to speak to authorities.The announcement from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee comes as the Trump administration continues to face fierce scrutiny for its handling of the Epstein case.Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting and trafficking  teenage girls for sexual abuse by Epstein.  In July, the committee declined to offer Maxwell legal immunity in exchange for her testimony.In August, the committee issued legal summons to Maxwell, requiring her to submit evidence under oath. Maxwell's legal team said that requiring her to both testify from jail, and without any legal immunity, were \"non-starters\".The lawyers said she \"cannot risk further criminal exposure in a politically charged environment without formal immunity\" as speaking from prison \"creates real security risks and undermines the integrity of the process\".House lawmakers cannot force Maxwell to waive her Fifth Amendment protections.On Tuesday, Maxwell's legal team said in a letter to the committee that she would continue to refuse to testify.\"Put plainly, proceeding under these circumstances would serve no other purpose than pure political theater and a complete waste of taxpayer monies,\" the attorneys wrote. \"The Committee would obtain no testimony, no answers, and no new facts.\"Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021, had appealed against the conviction to the  Supreme Court last October but the top court declined to hear the former British socialite's appeal.Her only route to leave prison early would be a presidential pardon, unless she is able to persuade a federal judge in New York to vacate or amend her sentence. The White House has denied that Trump is considering granting her clemency, however, Trump has also said he has not ruled it out.Separately, the Department of Justice faced a deadline of 19 December last year to release all remaining Epstein files in its possession. So far only a fraction of them have been made public.The department has faced criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle over the number of redactions in the files, which the law permits only to protect victims' identities and active criminal investigations.Meanwhile, the Republican-led House Oversight Committee voted to hold former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in contempt of Congress over their refusal to comply with subpoenas in its Epstein investigation.The committee had summoned both Clintons to testify about Epstein, with whom Bill Clinton has appeared in photographs in the 1990s and early 2000s.Bill Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein's abuse, and has denied knowledge of his sex offending.Lawyers for the Clintons had called the Oversight Committee subpoenas \"unenforceable\", and said they had already provided the \"limited information\" they had about Epstein.The committee approved the measure with the support of several Democrats. If it passes the full House of Representatives, the matter will be referred to the justice department.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. Sign up here.",

    "body": "17 hours agoJonathan Josephs,Adam HancockandArchie Mitchell,Business reportersGetty ImagesThe European Parliament has suspended the approval of a key US trade deal agreed in July in protest against Donald Trump's demand to take over Greenland.The suspension was announced in Strasbourg, France, on Wednesday, as the US president addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos.The move followed renewed trade tensions between the US and Europe sparked by Trump's bid to acquire Greenland, which had rattled financial markets, reviving talk of a trade war and the possibility of retaliation against the US. Hours later, Trump said on social media he had reached a \"framework\" deal on Greenland's future and would not carry out threats to put new tariffs on eight Nato members.Trade tensions between the US and Europe had eased since the two sides struck a deal at Trump's Turnberry golf course in Scotland in July.That agreement set US levies on most European goods at 15%, down from the 30% Trump had initially threatened as part of his \"Liberation Day\" wave of tariffs in April. In exchange, Europe had agreed to invest in the US and make changes on the continent expected to boost US exports. The deal would have still required approval from the European Parliament to become official. But on Wednesday, days after Trump threatened fresh US tariffs over Greenland, Bernd Lange, chair of the European Parliament's International Trade Committee, said it was \"left with no alternative but to suspend work on the two Turnberry legislative proposals\". He said work to implement the trade plans would be on hold \"until the US decides to re-engage on a path of cooperation rather than confrontation, and before any further steps are taken\". The move renewed the possibility that the EU might move forward with tariffs on a possible €93bn ($109bn, £81bn) worth of American goods it announced last year in response to Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.It had put those plans on hold while the trade deal was being finalised but those levies would now come into force on 7 February unless the bloc moves to extend the pause or approves the new deal. Lange, speaking before Trump announced the \"framework deal\" and backed off the tariff threat,  said there would be \"no possibility for compromise\" until Trump's threats ended. He also raised the prospect of the use of the \"anti-coercion instrument\" of retaliatory measures, nicknamed a \"trade bazooka\", an idea also backed by French President Emmanuel Macron.In an interview with the BBC after Trump's announcement, Lange declined to say whether it could salvage the trade deal, adding that it would take \"some time\" to understand its implications. \"We have to look what this so-called solution would mean,\" he said.There seems to be a sense in Brussels that Trump's climbdown was inevitable. When BBC News asked one well placed EU source for a response to President Trump saying he wouldn't go ahead with the tariffs, the response was simply an eye-rolling emoji.Over the last year, financial markets have batted away concerns over the impact of the US president's policy announcements, taking comfort in the TACO acronym, Trump Always Chickens Out.It seems the sense of him not following through on threats has also taken hold in some corridors of power.In his Davos speech, Trump repeated his interest in the US acquiring Greenland from Denmark, but said \"I don't have to use force, I don't want to use force, I won't use force\". He called for \"immediate negotiations\" with the country about how he could take over the island, which he has argued is crucial for US and global security, announcing the \"framework\" of a future deal a few hours later.Trump's speech helped to calm financial markets on both sides of the Atlantic, which had sunk in previous days. Shares in the US gained further on the deal announcement, with the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, rising more than 1% in afternoon trading on Wednesday, while the FTSE 100 closed slightly higher.The price of gold continued to make gains as it rose above $4,842 (£3,604) an ounce for the first time. The price of silver remained slightly lower than Monday's record high of $95 an ounce, hovering around $94.Precious metals are seen as safer assets to hold in times of uncertainty, and the prices of both gold and silver have soared over the past year.The US and the 27-nation European Union are each others' single biggest trade partners, with more than €1.6tn ($1.9tn, £1.4tn) in goods and services exchanged in 2024, according to European figures. That represents nearly a third of all global trade.When Trump started announcing tariffs last year, it prompted threats of retaliation from many political leaders, including in Europe. In the end, however, many, opted to negotiate instead. Only China and Canada stuck by their threats to hit American goods with tariffs, with Canada quietly withdrawing most of those measures in September, concerned they were damaging the Canadian economy.In a speech in Davos on Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney urged \"middle powers\" to unite to push back against the might-makes-right world of great power rivalry that he warned was emerging. \"When we only negotiate bilaterally with a hegemon, we negotiate from weakness. We accept what is offered. We compete with each other to be the most accommodating,\" he warned. \"This is not sovereignty. It is the performance of sovereignty while accepting subordination.\"The US has previously expressed impatience with European progress toward approval of the deal amid ongoing disagreements over tech and metals tariffs. But ahead of Trump's arrival in Davos, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said European leaders should not jump to retaliate, urging them to \"have an open mind\".\"I tell everyone, sit back. Take a deep breath. Do not retaliate,\" he said.Looming in the background of the trade tensions is a pending Supreme Court decision over whether many of the tariffs Trump announced last year are legal. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoBethany BellVienna correspondentReutersEgisto Ott is accused of collecting large amounts of data and handing information to Russian intelligenceFormer intelligence official Egisto Ott has gone on trial in Vienna, accused of spying for Russia in what is being dubbed Austria's biggest spy trial in years.Egisto Ott, who told the court on Thursday that he was not guilty, is charged with having handed over information to Russian intelligence officers and to Jan Marsalek, the fugitive executive of collapsed German payments firm Wirecard.The prosecutor told the court that Ott, 63, was \"not romantic about Russia\" but had acted out of financial motives and frustration with his career. \"Simply put, this was betraying the country.\" he said. Ott's lawyer, Anna Mair, rejected the allegations.\"Don't you think that if he had really been spying for Russia, he would have covered his tracks?\" she asked.The prosecutor argued that people like Ott were \"very susceptible\" to working for the Russians, saying: \"They are frustrated in their careers and urgently need money.\"Ott had done \"excellent\" work for the Russian secret service\", the prosecution added. The former intelligence official had been broke since 2013 at the latest, the court heard: \"The Russian secret service pays very well.\"He is alleged to have \"abused his authority\" as an Austrian intelligence official by collecting large amounts of personal data, such as locations, vehicle registration numbers, or travel movements.Prosecutors say he did this between 2015 and 2020 without authorisation, often using national and international police databases.They also accuse him of supporting \"a secret intelligence service of the Russian Federation to the detriment of the Republic of Austria\" by collecting secret facts and a large amount of personal data from police databases between 2017 and 2021.The spy scandal has revived fears that Austria remains a hotbed of Russian espionage activity and observers will also be watching closely for details that could emerge about Jan Marsalek.Marsalek, who is also an Austrian citizen, is wanted by German police for alleged fraud and is currently believed to be in Moscow, having fled via Austria in 2020.The subject of an Interpol Red Notice, he is alleged to be an intelligence asset for the FSB, Russia's secretive security service.Prosecutors allege that Egisto Ott handed information to Marsalek and unknown representatives of the Russian intelligence service, and received payment in return.In 2022, they say, Marsalek commissioned him to obtain a laptop containing secret electronic security hardware used by EU states for secure electronic communication. The laptop, they say, was handed over to the Russian intelligence service.Egisto Ott is also suspected, reports say, of having passed phone data from senior Austrian interior ministry officials to Russia.Austria's Standard newspaper says Egisto Ott apparently obtained the work phones after they accidentally fell into the River Danube on an interior ministry boating trip. He is alleged to have copied their contents and passed them on to Jan Marsalek, and Moscow.Egisto Ott is charged with abuse of authority and corruption and espionage against Austria and faces up to five years in prison, if he is found guilty.When he was arrested in 2024, Austria's then Chancellor, Karl Nehammer, described the case as \"a threat to democracy and our country's national security\".Munich PoliceJan Marsalek, former executive at Wirecard, is believed to have escaped to MoscowIn a separate development, prosecutors in the Austrian town of Wiener Neustadt have told the BBC that a former MP, Thomas Schellenbacher, has been charged with helping Marsalek to escape following the collapse of the Wirecard company in 2020, when it emerged that €1.9bn (£1.7bn) was missing from its accounts.Schellenbacher is alleged to have helped Jan Marsalek fly to Belarus, from Bad Vöslau in Austria, in June 2020.Schellenbacher was an MP for the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ), which has been accused by Austria's Green Party, now in opposition, of enabling Russian espionage, of acting as \"an extension of Russia's arm\" in Austria.The FPÖ and its leader Herbert Kickl have denied the allegations - and have not faced any legal action in connection with any of them.Marsalek, who was the Wirecard's Chief Operating Officer, has since been charged with fraud and embezzlement, suspected of having inflated company's balance sheet total and sales volume.He is also believed to have been the controller of a group of Bulgarians who were convicted in London in 2025, of spying for Russia.Messages from that trial reveal Marsalek has had plastic surgery to alter his appearance as well as details of his life as a fugitive.\"I'm off to bed. Had another cosmetic surgery, trying to look differently, and I am dead tired and my head hurts,\" he wrote to one of the Bulgarians, Roussev, on Telegram in February 2022.In another, dated 11 May 2021, Roussev congratulated Marsalek for learning Russian.\"Well I am trying to improve my skills on a few fronts. Languages is one of them,\" the Austrian responded.\"In my new role as an international fugitive I must outperform James Bond.\"",

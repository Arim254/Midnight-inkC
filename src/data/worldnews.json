    "body": "1 day agoJerome Wirawan,in Indonesia, and Aleks PhillipsReutersMore than 50 people have been injured in explosions during Friday prayers at a mosque in Indonesia, with authorities identifying a 17-year-old student as the suspected perpetrator. The incident happened at around 12:15 local time (05:15 GMT) inside a school complex that housed the mosque in Kelapa Gading - a district in the capital, Jakarta. The victims, mostly pupils, sustained a range of injuries, including severe burns. The suspect was also hurt, according to Indonesia's police chief, Listyo Sigit Prabowo. He added that an investigation into the incident is under way, \"including how the suspect assembled and carried out the attack\". A bomb disposal team was deployed to the state-run high school complex following the explosions to collect evidence and ensure there were no other explosive devices.A pupil at the school alleged to Indonesia's government-owned news agency Antara that a homemade bomb had been brought in by a student who had often been bullied by other students.Other pupils told Indonesian news outlets that the suspect was a \"loner\" who often made drawings depicting violence, and who had been found lying on the ground following the explosion.A cook at the school described seeing white smoke coming from the mosque and broken windows after the \"massive\" blast.\"Our hearts were beating fast, we couldn't breathe,\" she told the Reuters news agency.A high-ranking Jakarta Metropolitan Police officer confirmed the presence of two objects resembling firearms at the scene.Images from Antara suggest one of the objects appeared to be a submachine gun and another looked like a pistol.The submachine gun-type object appears to be inscribed on its barrel with: \"14 words. For Agartha.\"On its body, it says: \"Brenton Tarrant. Welcome to Hell.\"Brenton Tarrant is the perpetrator of a 2019 mass shooting at a mosque and Islamic centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, that killed 51 and injured dozens of others.A minister who visited the scene later on Friday sought to dispel suggestions that weapons were present at the site, telling CNN Indonesia what had been pictured \"turned out to be a toy gun, not a real gun\".Lodewijk Freidrich Paulus also called on the public not to presume the explosion was a \"terrorist act\" as investigators were still combing over the scene.Another object found at the site was a dark green belt for storing gun cartridges.Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population.",

The crew locked themselves inside a fortified citadel while the attackers took control of the ship.A Spanish warship, the ESPS Victoria, operating under the EU's anti-piracy mission Operation Atalanta, reached the tanker on Friday afternoon. Special forces boarded the vessel and found all 24 crew members unharmed.\"The crew is safe and no injuries have been reported. Throughout the incident, they remained in the citadel in direct contact with Atalanta,\" the EU mission said, adding that a \"show of force\" had prompted the pirates to abandon the ship before the warship arrived.It added that the threat risk in the area \"remains critical\" as the pirates are still in the area. The rescue operation involved a helicopter, drone and surveillance aircraft. Just hours earlier, another ship in the same area was approached by a small speedboat but managed to evade it.It is the latest in a spate of attacks that have created concern about a resurgence of piracy in the area. Such activity had declined when international naval patrols and security measures were introduced after peaking more than a decade ago.However, attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels on ships in the Red Sea, which have been carried out for the past two years, have led vessels to be diverted through East Africa's Indian Ocean - creating new opportunities for Somali gangs.There were seven reported incidents of piracy that took place off the coast of Somalia last year, according to the International Maritime Bureau - including three hijackings. It reported only one incident of piracy in 2023. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoKathryn ArmstrongAFP via Getty ImagesDozens of families in Remedios T Romualde, on the island of Mindanao, are among those who have been evacuated ahead of the typhoon's arrivalThe Philippines is bracing for the arrival of another potentially devastating typhoon, less than a week after a different storm killed at least 200 people and left a trail of destruction. Fung-wong, known locally as Uwan, is forecast to intensify to a super typhoon - with sustained winds of at least 185km/h (115mph) - before making landfall on the island of Luzon on Sunday evening local time at the earliest.The Philippine meteorological service (Pagasa) says the storm will also bring heavy rain and the risk of life-threatening storm surges.Several schools have either cancelled classes on Monday or moved them online, while Philippine Airlines has cancelled a number of local flights.Typhoon Fung-wong is expected to weaken rapidly once it makes landfall but will likely remain a typhoon as it travels over Luzon. Eastern parts of the Philippines have already begun experiencing heavy rains and winds, a Pagasa official said in a briefing on Saturday evening local time.While much of the country is expected to be impacted, there are particular concerns about those areas that could take a direct hit - including the small island of Catanduanes, which lies off the coast of southern Luzon.Residents there, as well as in other low-lying and coastal areas, have been urged to move to higher ground ahead of the storm's arrival. A civil defence spokesman said evacuations had to be carried out by Sunday morning at the latest and should not be attempted during heavy rain and strong winds. How do hurricanes or typhoons form and are they getting stronger?Typhoon Fung-wong has also forced the suspension of rescue operations following the passage of Kalmaegi, one of the strongest typhoons this year.Heavy rainfall sent torrents of mud down hillsides and into residential areas. Some poorer neighbourhoods were obliterated by the fast-moving flash floods.At least 204 people are now known to have died in the Philippines as a result of the earlier storm, while more than 100 are still missing. Five people also died in Vietnam, where strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows.Watch: Cars pile up on Philippines streets after major flooding from Typhoon KalmaegiThe Philippines government declared a state of calamity across the country after Typhoon Kalmaegi and in preparation for the coming storm.It has given government agencies more power to access emergency funds and fast-track the procurement and delivery of essential goods and services to those in need.For some Filipinos, the devastation wrought by Typhoon Kalmaegi earlier this week has left them even more anxious about the storm to come. \"We decided to evacuate because the recent typhoon brought floods in our area, and now I just want to keep my family safe,\" Norlito Dugan told the AFP news agency.He is among those who have taken shelter in a church in the city of Sorsogon in Luzon.Another resident, Maxine Dugan said: \"I'm here because the waves near my house are now huge, I live near the shore. The winds there are now very strong, and the waves are huge.\"The Philippines is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to tropical cyclones, due to its location on the Pacific Ocean where such weather systems form.About 20 tropical cyclones form in that region every year, half of which impact the country directly.Climate change is not thought to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones worldwide.However, warmer oceans coupled with a warmer atmosphere - fuelled by climate change - have the potential to make those that do form even more intense. That can potentially lead to higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall, and a greater risk of coastal flooding.",

    "body": "1 hour agoMallory MoenchHostages and Missing Families ForumThe body has been identified as Lior RudaeffThe Israeli military says it has identified a body handed over from Gaza as that of Israeli-Argentinian Lior Rudaeff.The 61-year-old was killed while attempting to defend Nir Yitzhak kibbutz during the Hamas attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023 and his body was taken to Gaza by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) armed group, the military said.PIJ said the body was found on Friday in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. Hamas has now returned all 20 living hostages and 23 out of 28 deceased hostages under the first phase of a ceasefire deal that started on 10 October. Four of the five dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis and one is Thai.Israel has criticised Hamas for not yet returning all the bodies. Hamas says it is hard to find them under rubble.PIJ is an armed group allied with Hamas. It took part in the 7 October attack and previously held some Israeli hostages. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a campaign group, welcomed the return.\"Lior's return provides some measure of comfort to a family that has lived with agonising uncertainty and doubt for over two years,\" it said in a statement. \"We will not rest until the last hostage is brought home.\"During the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza. Israel has also handed over the bodies of 300 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 20 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas, along with those of three foreign hostages - one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.MOHAMMED SABER/EPA/ShutterstockHamas's military wing stood guard as they searched for hostage bodies on 5 November The parties also agreed to an increase of aid to the Gaza Strip, a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a halt to fighting, although violence has flared up as both sides accused one another of breaching the deal.Israel launched air strikes after accusing Hamas fighters of killing two of its soldiers on 19 October and of killing another soldier on 28 October. Hamas said it was unaware of clashes in the area of the first incident and had no connection to the second attack.Israeli military actions have killed at least 241 people since the start of the ceasefire, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage. All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were abducted in the attack.At least 69,169 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, the health ministry reported.",

    "body": "American delivery firms UPS and FedEx have temporarily grounded part of their fleets of cargo planes after a mid-take-off crash in Kentucky on Tuesday left at least 14 people dead.The UPS aircraft burst into flames shortly after take-off when it collided with neighbouring business premises, triggering a huge fire that gutted several buildings and closed Louisville International Airport.UPS said the decision to ground MD-11 models followed instructions from manufacturer Boeing, while rival delivery giant FedEx confirmed it would follow suit.Officials are yet to determine what caused the deadly crash.Hours before the fleet was grounded, officials confirmed the death toll had risen to 14 after another body was found, with buildings caught up in the fire still being searched for more victims.\"We pray for each of the victims' families and pray that no additional victims are lost,\" Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said. In a statement, UPS said the decision to ground 9% of its fleet was out of an \"abundance of caution\".Boeing later said in a statement to Reuters that it recommended UPS and FedEx suspend use of the MD-11 plane.\"This recommendation was made in an abundance of caution and we will continue coordinating with the FAA on this matter,\" a Boeing spokesperson said.It is unclear to what extent delivery services will be impacted by the moves from UPS and FedEx, which are the world's largest cargo carriers.Neither company has so far listed any active service disruptions as a result of the grounding of their MD-11 fleets.FedEx said it operated 28 MD-11s and Reuters quoted a UPS factsheet that said the firm had 27 in its fleet before the Kentucky crash.\"Contingency plans are in place to flex our integrated air and ground network to help protect time-sensitive, critical shipments such as lifesaving pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and other products move through our network without disruption,\" FedEx said in a statement. UPS also said contingency plans were in place to continue its service. A statement continued: \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.\"The BBC has contacted Western Global Airlines - another US cargo airline that also uses MD-11s. The model of aircraft involved in the crash was an MD-11F triple-engine plane, which first entered service 34 years ago with Thai Airways as a passenger jet, but was transferred to UPS in 2006.MD-11s were originally manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, before the company merged with Boeing in 1997. Production of MD-11 planes ended in 2000, while passenger service officially ended in 2014.According to the National Transportation and Safety Board, the left engine caught fire and detached from the wing during take-off.The aircraft was carrying 38,000 gallons (144,000 litres) of fuel as it took off for a flight to Hawaii, which contributed to the size of the fire after the crash.",

    "body": "32 minutes agoJames Landale,Diplomatic correspondent in Kyiv and Alex KleidermanAt least six people have died after Russia launched hundreds of missile and drone attacks on energy infrastructure and residential targets in Ukraine overnight.A strike on an apartment building in the city of Dnipro killed two people and wounded 12, while three died in Zaporizhzhia. In all, 25 locations across Ukraine, including the capital city Kyiv, were hit, leaving many areas without electricity and heating. Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on Telegram that major energy facilities were damaged in the Poltava, Kharkiv and Kyiv regions, and work was under way to restore power. In Russia, the defence ministry said its forces had shot down 79 Ukrainian drones overnight.The Ukrainian air force said Russia had launched more than 450 exploding bomber drones and 45 missiles. Nine missiles and 406 drones were reportedly shot down.The Ukrainian Energy Ministry said there were power cuts in the Dnipropetrovsk, Chernihiv, Zaporizhzhya, Odesa and Kirovohrad regions, but restoration work was ongoing.Svyrydenko said critical infrastructure facilities have already been reconnected, and water supply is being maintained using generators. Russia argues its attacks on energy targets are aimed at the Ukrainian military.Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure ahead of winter are now a familiar part of this war. But ministers in Kyiv are acutely concerned that Moscow is not just trying to damage the morale of Ukraine's people but also bring its economy to a standstill by collapsing its energy network. Analysts say this fourth winter of Russia's full scale invasion will prove a significant test of Ukraine's defensive resilience.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the attacks showed there must be \"no exceptions\" to Western sanctions on Russian energy as a way of putting pressure on Moscow. The missile strikes came only hours after the US gave Hungary a one-year exemption from restrictions on buying oil and gas from Russia. In October, the US effectively blacklisted two of Russia's largest oil companies, threatening sanctions on those who buy from them. But on Friday, during a visit to Washington by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban - a close personal and political ally of Donald Trump - the US president  announced the exemption for Budapest.In a message on Telegram, Zelensky said the overnight attacks showed that \"pressure must be intensified\" on Russia.He said \"for every (one of) Moscow's strike on energy infrastructure - aimed at harming ordinary people before winter - there must be a sanctions response targeting all Russian energy, with no exceptions\".He said Ukraine expected \"relevant decisions from the US, Europe and the G7\".",

    "body": "21 hours agoSteve Mellen and Alys DaviesA former British soldier is facing extradition to Kenya in connection with the alleged murder of a 21-year-old woman there in 2012.The National Crime Agency (NCA) said Robert James Purkiss was arrested in Tidworth, Wiltshire on 6 November and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday.He was arrested by specialist officers from the NCA's National Extradition Unit in connection with the killing of Agnes Wanjiru after a warrant was issued in September, the agency added.Mr Purkiss, 38, told the court he intended to contest the extradition and was remanded into custody ahead of his next appearance at the same court on 14 November.His lawyers told the court that he \"vehemently denies\" murder.Ms Wanjiru's body was discovered in a septic tank near a hotel in the town of Nanyuki, about 124 miles (200km) north of Nairobi, three months after she had gone missing on 31 March 2012. She had a five-month-old baby at the time.Her body was found near a British army training camp. On the night she was killed, she had reportedly been at a bar with friends where British soldiers were also present. Ms Wanjiru's niece, Esther Njoki, met the UK's defence minister last month in order to push for Mr Purkiss's extradition. In a statement issued through Leigh Day, the lawyers acting for Ms Wanjiru's family, on Friday Ms Njoki said: \"My family is incredibly relieved to hear that the suspect in my aunt's case has been arrested.\"We have waited so many years for this moment which marks an important step towards finally obtaining justice for our beloved Agnes.\"Leigh Day partner Tessa Gregory said: \"This is a huge moment for our client and her family who have been fighting for over a decade to obtain justice for Agnes.\"We hope the UK and Kenyan authorities will now work together to ensure that the suspect can face trial in Kenya as quickly as possible.\"Ms Wanjiru's family has long accused the British army of covering up her death and the Kenyan authorities of failing to properly investigate the case at the time.An inquest into her death was opened in 2018 following pressure from Ms Wanjiru's family, as well as Kenyan rights groups and feminists.In 2019, it concluded that Ms Wanjiru had been unlawfully killed by one or two British soldiers and that she had suffered stab wounds to the chest and abdomen.Later in 2021, a Sunday Times investigation reported that a British soldier had confessed to colleagues that he killed Ms Wanjiru. The soldier left the army after the incident and reportedly continued to live in the UK.In 2024, the army announced it was launching an internal review into the conduct of British soldiers in Kenya, including in Nanyuki.It found 35 suspected cases of soldiers having engaged in sexual exploitation and abuse, including transactional sex, with local women - nine of these being after the army officially banned such conduct in 2022.",

    "body": "Serbia's parliament has passed a law which paves the way for a controversial property development led by US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner in the capital Belgrade.His firm Affinity Partners has sought to build a luxury hotel and apartment complex on the site of the former Yugoslav Army headquarters.The ruined building, which was bombed by Nato forces in 1999 during its intervention to stop Serbia's military campaign in Kosovo, has symbolic value to some who view it as a memorial and symbol of ongoing opposition to the military alliance.Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic, who has pursued close ties with Trump, backed the plans despite protests and legal challenges.Last year, the Serbian government stripped the building of its protected status and agreed a 99-year lease with Kushner's firm, which had set out plans for a $500m (£379.9m) development. The decision triggered demonstrations and led to an investigation into whether a Serbian official had forged documentation used during the process to change the building's status.In a conversation with the BBC in June, Vucic defended the proposal, saying \"it's important to overcome the burden from 1999\". He continued: \"We are ready to build better relations with the US – I think that is terribly important for this country.\"The stalled planning process came to a head on Friday when Vucic's party - which has a majority in parliament - pushed ahead with a special vote on clearing the site and won.Opposition politicians have labelled the decision unconstitutional, including Aleksandar Jovanovic, who described it as a crime, and told the AFP news agency that the landmark would be replaced with \"casinos and Jacuzzis\". Meanwhile, centre-left MP Marinika Tepicċ said the government was sacrificing the country's history \"to please Trump\", Politico reported.The passage of the law has also been criticised by architectural experts, and comes after Transparency Serbia, an anti-corruption organisation, raised concerns about state-backed developments. According to Serbian media reports pre-dating his first presidential run, Trump has previously considered building a hotel in Belgrade.Last March, Kushner told the New York Times he was not aware of his father-in-law's reported past interest.The decision to clear the way for the development comes as Vucic's government seeks to maintain good relations with both Washington and Moscow.Serbia has been impacted by both Trump's tariffs and sanctions on Russian interests in the country, including on its sole oil-refinery, the majority Russian-owned Nafna Industrika Srbije (NIS).",

    "body": "3 hours agoAndré Rhoden-PaulEPADonald Trump has said the US will not attend the G20 summit in South Africa over widely discredited claims that white people are being persecuted in the country. The US president said it was a \"total disgrace\" that South Africa is hosting the meeting, where leaders from the world's largest economies will gather in Johannesburg later this month. South Africa's foreign ministry described the decision by the White House as \"regrettable\". None of South Africa's political parties - including those that represent Afrikaners and the white community in general - have claimed that there is a genocide in South Africa.Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social: \"It is a total disgrace that the G20 will be held in South Africa.\"Afrikaners (people who are descended from Dutch settlers, and also French and German immigrants) are being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated,\" he wrote.\"No US government official will attend as long as these human rights abuses continue.\"Trump had earlier said South Africa should not be in the G20 at all, and that he would send vice-president JD Vance, instead of attending himself. But now the White House says no US official will go.ReutersDonald Trump  confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in May Every year, a different member state hosts the G20 and sets the agenda for the summit - with the US due to take its turn after South Africa.The South African foreign ministry said in a statement: \"The South African government wishes to state, for the record, that the characterisation of Afrikaners as an exclusively white group is ahistorical. \"Furthermore, the claim that this community faces persecution, is not substantiated by fact.\"Since returning to office in January, Trump has repeatedly accused South Africa of discriminating against its white minority, including in May when when he confronted his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa in the Oval Office. The Trump administration has given Afrikaners refugee status, stating a \"genocide\" is taking place in South Africa. Last week, the White House announced plans to cap refugee admissions at a record low, and give priority to white South Africans. South Africa's government said the claims of a white genocide is \"widely discredited and unsupported by reliable evidence\" and pointed to the \"limited uptake\" of this offer by South Africans. The claims were dismissed as \"clearly imagined\" by a South African court in February.The G20 was founded in 1999 after the Asian financial crisis. The nations involved have more than 85% of the world's wealth and its aim was to restore economic stability.The first leaders' summit was held in 2008 in response to that year's global financial turmoil, to promote international co-operation.Now the leaders get together each year - along with representatives of the European Union and African Union - to talk about the world's economies and the issues countries are facing.",

    "body": "1 day agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorWatch: The moment spectators confront a protester holding a flare during the Paris concertFour people have been detained by French police after protesters set off flares during a concert by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra in Paris on Thursday night.Clashes broke out in the auditorium during one of three disruptions to the performance by conductor Lahav Shani and pianist Sir Andras Schiff.The concert, which featured a programme of Beethoven and Tchaikovsky, had already been criticised by a French union for the performing arts, and pro-Palestinian activists had called for a boycott.However, Culture Minister Rachida Dati strongly defended freedom of creativity as a French value and Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said nothing could excuse the \"serious disturbances in the hall\".Ticket-holders tried to disrupt the concert three times including twice with a flare, the Philharmonie de Paris said in a statement. At one point concertgoers said the hall became filled with smoke.Video filmed inside the Pierre Boulez auditorium showed one man brandishing a flare as he walked down steps in a seating area. He was confronted by spectators and clashes broke out.\"The troublemakers were removed and the concert, which had to be interrupted, resumed and came to a peaceful conclusion,\" the venue said, adding that it was taking legal action.The disruption prompted an angry response from government figures on Friday, with Laurent Nuñez firmly condemning the incidents and praising police for their rapid response. But Manon Aubry, a European Parliament member for the radical left France Unbowed, refused to condemn the disruption on French TV, arguing that the orchestra's artists \"represent the Israeli state [which] commits war crimes\". Ahead of the concert, pro-Palestinian activists had pushed for its cancellation. Although the CGT-Spectacle union, which represents workers in the performing arts, did not go that far. It had called on the Philharmonie de Paris to \"remind its audience of the extremely serious accusations levelled against [Israel's] leaders\" and saw the concert as \"an attempt at normalisation by the State of Israel\".Hannes Magerstaedt/Getty ImagesThe Israel Philharmonic's performance was led by conductor Lahav Shani (file photo)Rachida Dati said nothing justified a call for a cultural boycott and said there was \"no excuse for antisemitism\".The Israel Philharmonic's star conductor, 36-year-old Lahav Shani, was at the centre of another controversy in September when the organisers of the Flanders Festival in the Belgian city of Ghent cancelled his performance with the Munich Philharmonic, citing \"insufficient clarity\" on his attitude towards the Israeli government.Its decision was criticised by both the Belgian and German governments and days later Belgian Prime Minister Bart de Wever attended a Munich Philharmonic concert with Lahav Shani conducting in the German city of Essen.Condemning Thursday night's disruption, the Philharmonie de Paris said that \"regardless of people's opinions, it is utterly unacceptable to threaten the safety of the public, staff and artists... bringing [violence] into a concert hall is extremely serious\".",

    "body": "7 hours agoTiffany WertheimerBobi Wine/XBob Njagi and Nicholas Oyoo were helping Bobi Wine campaign Human rights groups in Kenya say two activists who disappeared in neighbouring Uganda five weeks ago have turned up alive and well. Eyewitnesses reported seeing Bob Njagi and Nicholas Oyoo being forced into a car by masked uniformed men after a political event where they were supporting the Ugandan opposition leader Bobi Wine. On Saturday, activist organisation Vocal Africa confirmed the men were safe, and being transported from Busia in Uganda to Kenya's capital, Nairobi.\"Let this moment signal an important shift towards upholding the human rights of East Africans anywhere in East African Community,\" the organisation wrote on its Instagram page.Ugandan police denied the men were in their custody, but Kenyan rights groups lobbied the Ugandan authorities to free them.In a joint statement, Vocal Africa, the Law Society of Kenya and Amnesty International thanked the Kenyan and Ugandan governments, activists, journalists, diplomats and \"all active citizens who have tirelessly campaigned for this moment\".Former pop star Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, is running for the presidency in next year's elections, challenging President Yoweri Museveni, 80, who has held power since 1986.Wine accused the Ugandan government of targeting the two Kenyans for associating with him.Ugandan security agencies have often been accused of orchestrating the detention of opposition politicians and supporters while not in uniform. Some of those arrested have later resurfaced in court facing criminal charges.The latest disappearances mirror past incidents involving politicians and activists across the East African region.Last year, Njagi was picked up in Kenya by masked men during a wave of abductions believed to have been targeting government critics in the country.He surfaced a month later, after a court ordered police to produce him. He later recounted the harrowing conditions in captivity, where he said he was often isolated and denied food.Earlier this year, Kenyan activist Boniface Mwangi and his Ugandan counterpart Agather Atuhaire were detained in Tanzania and held incommunicado for days before being abandoned at their respective national borders.They later recounted being brutally mistreated, including sexual torture at the hands of the Tanzanian authorities – allegations which police dismissed as \"hearsay\".Last year, another Uganda opposition figure, Kizza Besigye, mysteriously disappeared in Nairobi only to surface four days later in a military court in Uganda, where he faces treason charges.The cases have since sparked widespread condemnation and concerns that East African governments could be collaborating to contain dissent.You may also be interested in:How a Ugandan opposition leader disappeared in Kenya and ended up in military court'We live in fear' - forced expulsions taint Kenya's safe haven imageUganda's Yoweri Museveni: How an ex-rebel has stayed in power for 35 yearsBobi Wine: Uganda's 'ghetto president'Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "11 hours agoGary O'Donoghue,Chief North America Correspondent, Washington and Rachel HaganDonald Trump has exempted Hungary from sanctions over its continued purchases of Russian oil and gas for one year, a White House official has confirmed to BBC News.Earlier, the US president said he would consider an opt-out for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a close Trump ally who has maintained good relations with Russia throughout the Ukraine war.Speaking on Friday during Orban's visit to the White House, Trump said an exemption was under consideration because \"it's very difficult for him [Orban] to get the oil and gas from other areas\". It comes after the US effectively blacklisted two of Russia's largest oil companies last month, threatening sanctions on those who buy from them.Following the meeting, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó wrote on X that the US had given Budapest \"a full and unlimited exemption from sanctions on oil and gas\". An official later told the BBC that that exemption was time-limited to one year.This decision by Trump marks a major victory for Orban, who had said the sanctions would ruin his country's economy. During the public part of the meeting, Trump sounded sympathetic to Hungary's position as a landlocked country, dependent on oil and gas from Russia, but stopped short of giving a specific guarantee. But subsequently it became clear that the US president had granted an exemption for one year - seemingly flying in the face of his determination just two weeks ago to penalise anyone who did business with Russia's energy companies. Hungary has agreed to buy several hundred millions of dollars of US natural gas as part of the arrangement, but it is a deal likely to go down badly in many European capitals, most of whom have long opposed Hungary's friendly stance towards Moscow. Orban has long been a close personal and political ally of the president, echoing much of Donald Trump's populist right wing rhetoric over immigration and social issues. That loyalty seems to have earned the Hungarian prime minister some special treatment at a time when he is facing difficult elections in the spring.Trump added that while Hungary faced unique logistical challenges, including access to a sea that could be used to drill oil, he was \"very disturbed\" by other European countries that, he said, continued to buy Russian commodities despite not being landlocked.Orban, who has long resisted EU efforts to pressure Moscow over Ukraine, has defended his energy ties with Russia, saying on Friday that pipelines are neither \"ideological\" nor \"political\", but a \"physical reality\" due to the lack of ports.He has been using his country's heavy dependence on Russian oil and gas as a means to maintain his good relations with Moscow, as well as a platform upon which he hopes to win re-election next April in Hungary. He has promised \"cheap Russian energy\" to voters.Trump and Orban also discussed the war in Ukraine on Friday - their first formal meeting since Trump returned to power - including the possibility of holding talks with Putin.\"He [Orban] understands Putin and knows him very well... I think that Viktor feels we're going to get that war ended in the not-too-distant future\", Trump said.The Hungarian leader, meanwhile, claimed that only their two nations truly wanted peace in Ukraine. \"All the other governments prefer to continue the war because many of them think that Ukraine can win on the front line, which is a misunderstanding of the situation.\"Trump asked him: \"So you would say that Ukraine cannot win that war?\" To which Orban replied: \"You know, a miracle can happen.\"Aside from the issue of oil and gas sanctions, Hungary's export-driven car industry has been hit by Trump's tariffs on European goods, adding to an already weak economy. Despite frequent clashes with EU leaders over migration, democracy, and the rule of law, Trump urged Europe to \"respect this leader very, very strongly because he's been right on immigration.\"With additional reporting by Nick Thorpe",

    "body": "1 day agoJames WaterhouseEurope correspondentThe Belgian government has told the BBC it is urgently trying to acquire drone defences after a sighting forced its main airport near Brussels to close temporarily.Flights were paused at Zaventem airport on Thursday night, after drones were spotted nearby. They were also seen in other locations, including a military base.\"At first, drones flying over our military bases were seen as our problem,\" Defence Minister Theo Francken said. \"Now it has become a serious threat affecting civilian infrastructure across multiple European countries.\"Francken said several European allies have offered assistance, and he had accepted help from the German military which is providing anti-drone defences.About 3,000 passengers of Brussels Airlines were affected by the disruptions, and the carrier said it faced \"considerable costs\" from cancelling or diverting dozens of flights.\"EU compensation schemes don't apply here,\" Joelle Neeb of Brussels Airlines told the BBC. \"But we do have an obligation to make sure passengers get to their final destination as soon as possible by offering refunds of alternative flights, as well as covering their hotels and transport.\"She added that drones were a \"new threat\" and as such, the airline was adapting its contingency plans.\"When our main airport is closed even for just 30 minutes, that has a big impact and we need to act fast.\"Drone sightings have caused major flight disruptions across Europe in recent months, including in Sweden, Norway and Denmark.Some officials have blamed \"hybrid warfare\" by Russia, but the Kremlin has denied it has anything to do with it.German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius also alleges Moscow's involvement, suggesting these latest sightings could be linked to European Union discussions to use frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine.The controversial plan would see Kyiv receive a €140bn loan, but with the money being held in a Belgium-based bank, Euroclear. Brussels is nervous that it could be legally forced to pay Moscow back once the war in Ukraine ends.Belgian security services also suspect Russia, but Francken admits there is currently no accompanying evidence.In fact, amongst all the European finger pointing, there is no public proof suggesting Russia is responsible for these disruptions.Suspicions are nevertheless being fuelled by more serious airspace incursions that Moscow has recently carried out in Eastern Europe, involving fighter jets and larger attack drones.The Kremlin's likely goals are to both test European defences, as well as try to distract the bloc from supporting Ukraine, which is still on the receiving end of its invasion.Additional reporting by Bruno Boelpaep.",

    "body": "A former Israeli hostage who was released last month has told Israeli TV that he was sexually assaulted during his two years in captivity in Gaza.In an interview with Channel 13's Hazinor programme, Rom Braslavski, 21, described being stripped naked and tied up by members of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ).\"It was sexual violence, and its main purpose was humiliation. Its goal was to humiliate me, to crush my dignity,\" he said.He is the first male hostage to allege publicly that he was sexually assaulted.Warning: This article contains details some readers may find disturbing.Rom Braslavski was on leave from his service as a soldier in the Israeli military and was working as a security guard at the Nova music festival when Hamas and allied Palestinian armed groups attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages.Israel responded to the attacks by launching a military campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 68,800 people, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Four weeks ago, Mr Braslavski was among the last 20 living Israeli hostages who were released under a US-brokered ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.In the interview with Channel 13, broadcast late on Thursday, Mr Braslavski said his treatment by PIJ deteriorated rapidly after he had refused to convert from Judaism to Islam in March this year, which was also when the previous ceasefire collapsed.He said he was kept blindfolded for three weeks, had stones pushed into his ears to limit his hearing, and had his rations of food and water reduced.Then, he added, his captors received what they described as an order to torture him.Mr Braslavski said they tied him up, punched him, and whipped him with a metal cable – and that this was repeated several times a day.\"I entered into a loop, which I doubted I would come out of alive,\" he recalled.In August 2025, PIJ posted a video in which Mr Braslavski was seen crying and saying that he had run out of food and water, was unable to stand or walk, and was \"at death's door\".Following the publication of the video, Mr Braslavski told Channel 13, his captors also began to sexually assault him.\"They stripped me of all my clothes, my underwear, everything. They tied me up from the... When I was completely naked I was wiped out, dying without food and I prayed to God: 'Save me, get me out of this already',\" he said.When asked whether his captors did \"more things like that\", Mr Braslavski replied: \"Yes. It's hard for me to talk about this part specifically. I don't like to talk about it. And it's hard. It was a horrific thing.\"He added: \"You just pray to God for it to stop. And while I was there, every day, every beating, every day, I'd say to myself: 'I survived another day in hell. Tomorrow morning, I'll wake up to another hell. And another hell'.\"Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Mr Braslavski had shown \"extraordinary courage in sharing the horrors of his captivity, including a horrific sexual assault he endured\".\"The world must understand the scale of the crimes committed by the terrorists in Gaza, heinous cruelty, sexual violence, and abuse,\" he wrote on X.At least four women held as hostages have spoken publicly about alleged incidents of sexual abuse against themselves or fellow captives, according to Reuters.A PIJ official told Reuters news agency that Mr Braslavski's allegation of sexual assault was \"incorrect\", without elaborating.The UN Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict said in March 2024 that she and a team of experts had found \"convincing information\" of rape and sexualised torture being committed against some hostages in Gaza. They also found reasonable grounds to believe that sexual violence occurred in multiple locations, including rape and gang rape, during the 7 October attacks. Hamas said the report's findings were \"baseless\".A separate report by a UN commission of inquiry in March 2025 concluded that Israel had \"increasingly employed sexual, reproductive and other forms of gender-based violence against Palestinians\", including \"forced public stripping and nudity, sexual harassment including threats of rape, as well as sexual assault\". Israel called the allegations \"unfounded\".Last week, the former top lawyer in the Israeli military resigned after saying she was responsible for the leaking of a video that purportedly shows soldiers abusing a Palestinian detainee at a base in Israel last year. The detainee was treated for severe injuries after allegedly being stabbed in the rectum. Five soldiers have been charged over the incident.",

    "body": "Parts of Australia will face catastrophic fire conditions on Friday, when heatwaves are expected to hit most of the country.Severe to extreme heatwaves have been declared in every state and territory in Australia, except for Queensland, with high temperatures forecast for days.The state of Victoria has declared a total fire ban for Friday, as the fire danger rating will be set at \"catastrophic\" - the highest level. Some 450 schools and childcare centres will be closed.One meteorologist told the BBC that the combination of heatwaves and an elevated fire danger in parts of the country could create the most \"significant\" conditions since the devastating Black Summer bushfires.On Thursday, firefighters battled several blazes in Victoria and New South Wales (NSW), with a dozen planes carrying water called in to tackle a large fire near the city of Wodonga, the ABC reported.Melbourne experienced its hottest day in six years on Wednesday with a high of 40.9C (105.6F), while some coastal towns in Western Australia hit 49C.In NSW, the heatwave is expected to peak on Saturday with Sydney facing a high of 42C while areas of South Australia and Western Australia will see temperatures over 40C in the coming days. Friday will be the \"real peak of the current burst of heat,\" Angus Hines from the Bureau of Meteorology told the BBC.\"It will be a very hot day for almost all of South Australia, Victoria, most of New South Wales, parts of Tasmania\".Wednesday was the first significant heatwave for Melbourne and Adelaide, where millions of people live, with fire conditions set to worsen on Friday, he said.\"Firstly, the winds are strengthening across Victoria tomorrow,\" Hines said, adding that coupled with possible thunderstorms with little rain and dry lightning strikes, the fire danger will hit catastrophic levels for the northern parts of Victoria.\"This looks like the most significant event at a multi-day level for inland south-east Australia since 2019-2020,\" Hines said.That period six years ago saw Australia's most severe fire season on record, the so-called Black Summer where dozens of people died and tens of millions of hectares of land was burnt. In Victoria, authorities on Thursday warned that a catastrophic fire danger rating means potential blazes can be \"unpredictable and uncontrollable\".\"We need the community to play their role alongside our emergency services to protect lives and property,\" said Victoria's Emergency Management Commissioner Tim Wiebusch.\"Prepare now and enact your bushfire survival plan. If you are in an area of forecast catastrophic fire danger, leave early to an area with a lower fire risk.\"Australia's fire danger ratings scale has four levels, with catastrophic being the highest level, followed by extreme, high and moderate.A heatwave is declared when the minimum and maximum temperatures are expected to be unusually high for three days of more.",

    "body": "11 hours agoSamantha GranvilleLos AngelesReality television star Spencer Pratt has launched a campaign for mayor of Los Angeles, vowing to \"expose the system\".His longshot bid for city hall comes on the anniversary of a wildfire that destroyed his home and became one of California's most destructive blazes on record. Pratt, 42, made the announcement while speaking at a \"They Let Us Burn\" rally organised by residents who lost houses in the Palisades Fire. The protest marked a year since the fire ignited in the Pacific Palisades on 7 January 2025, tearing through the wealthy coastal community tucked between the Santa Monica Mountains and the Pacific Ocean.Another blaze, the Eaton Fire, sparked hours later on the other side of the city. In total, 31 people were killed and more than 16,000 homes and businesses were destroyed.Pratt posted photos on his Instagram page showing him signing what appears to be official campaign paperwork, although his filing was not yet official.\"Business as usual is a death sentence for Los Angeles,\" he told Wednesday's demonstration, \"and I'm done waiting for someone to take real action. That's why I am running for mayor.\"But let me be clear, this just isn't a campaign. This is a mission, and we are going to expose the system. \"We are going into every dark corner of LA politics and disinfecting the city with our light.\"He and his wife, former reality TV star Heidi Montag, lost their Pacific Palisades home in the fire.Pratt has since emerged as a vocal critic of Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Governor Gavin Newsom over their handling of the disaster.Pratt rose to fame in the mid-2000s as a cast member on MTV's Laguna Beach spin-off The Hills, where his relationship with Montag became a central storyline. The couple wed in 2008 and have two children. They later appeared on I'm a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here and the UK edition of Celebrity Big Brother.Despite his fame, Pratt is a first-time candidate who faces long odds in a crowded field for June's non-partisan mayoral primary.Bass, who won the mayoralty in 2022 after defeating real estate developer Rick Caruso, is seeking re-election.More than a dozen other candidates have entered the race.",

    "body": "A British man living in Western Australia is set to be deported over claims that he was part of a well-known neo-Nazi group.Ryan Turner's visa was cancelled on character grounds and he was taken into immigration detention on Tuesday. He can appeal the decision to cancel his visa or voluntarily return to the UK.Turner is understood to be a member of the National Socialist Network, the same group that organised an anti-Jewish rally outside the New South Wales parliament last year. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said: \"Our government has zero tolerance for bigotry and hate. If you don't like Australia, you can leave.\"The BBC has contacted the UK Foreign Office for comment.Last year, Australia tightened its hate crime laws, introducing mandatory jail terms for displaying hate symbols or performing a Nazi salute.In recent months, police have been cracking down on the use of these symbols amid fears of rising antisemitism and right wing extremism. Several foreign nationals with links to Nazi ideology have had their visas revoked including South African man Matthew Gruter who was detained last November.Gruter was also a part of the National Socialist Network and took part in the neo-Nazi rally outside the New South Wales parliament. It is unclear if Turner attended.Gruter was pictured in the front row of the rally along with about 60 other men, all clad in black, with a banner saying \"abolish the Jewish lobby\".Attendees also reportedly chanted \"blood and honour\", a slogan associated with the Hitler Youth, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Gruter, who had lived in Australia since 2022 and worked as a civil engineer, returned to South Africa with his wife and young child, the ABC reported in early December. In another case, a British man living in Queensland was arrested and charged for allegedly using a social media account to post the Nazi swastika, promote pro-Nazi ideology and call for violence towards the Jewish community.Just before Christmas, the man who was identified in court documents as Kayn Adam Charles Wells, was placed in immigration detention in Brisbane after his visa was cancelled. He faced court earlier this week - where he is understood to have requested voluntary removal from Australia - with the case adjourned until February. Last month, days after two gunmen killed 15 people at a Jewish event at Bondi Beach, Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced a crackdown on hate speech with new laws to target \"those who spread hate, division and radicalisation\".The reforms also aim to give the home affairs minister new powers to cancel or refuse visas for those who spread hate.",

    "body": "2 hours agoChris GrahamandRachel HaganRussian drone strikes on Ukraine have left more than one million people in the region of Dnipropetrovsk without heating and water supplies, Ukraine's deputy prime minister says. Oleksiy Kuleba added that work was continuing to restore services following the large-scale attack, which damaged infrastructure across the south-east. Electricity supplies were also disrupted for thousands more people in neighbouring Zaporizhzhia, but power has since been restored. Russia has recently intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, aimed at paralysing power supplies during a harsh winter. President Volodymyr Zelensky accused it of \"mockery\" and pleaded for Western support. Hospitals, water facilities and other critical services in Dnipropetrovsk were operating on backup systems, the energy ministry said, while residents were urged to limit electricity use to avoid further strain on the grid.DTEK, Ukraine's biggest private energy provider, is living in permanent crisis mode because of Russian attacks on the grid, its chief executive told the BBC last month, with most of Ukraine suffering from lengthy power cuts during winter.Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, which provides power for 5.6 million Ukrainians, said the intensity of strikes had been so frequent \"we just don't have time to recover\".As the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion approaches, Timchenko said Russia had repeatedly targeted DTEK's energy grid with \"waves of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles\" and his company had found it difficult to cope.\"There is no military sense in such strikes on the energy sector, on infrastructure, which leave people without electricity and heating in winter conditions,\" Zelensky said. He urged Ukrainians to remain \"resilient\" against Russia's attempts \"to break Ukraine\" and added that peace talks aimed at ending the war should not be a reason to slow down Western supplies for Ukraine's air defences.Zelensky has been on a diplomatic tour this week - meeting allies in the \"Coalition of the Willing\" and US President Donald Trump's peace envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. Following those talks in Paris on Tuesday, the UK and France signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops in Ukraine if a peace deal is reached - a move Moscow warned would make foreign forces a \"legitimate target\".But a day later, Zelensky said European allies had not given him sound guarantees that they would protect his country in the event of new Russian aggression.However, he also said he believed Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine could be brought to an end in the first half of 2026. Speaking at the opening of Cyprus's presidency of the EU for the next six months, he said negotiations with European partners and the US had entered a new stage and stressed that the EU should play a central role in any settlement.President Donald Trump has been leading efforts to bring the war to an end. His proposals - amended by Ukraine and its European allies - envisage Ukrainian territorial concessions to Russia in areas it does not already control in the country's east.Negotiations centre on those points - the last 10% of the deal, according to Zelensky. So far, Ukraine has refused to agree to cede territory to Russia.Once agreed, those proposals would need Russia's approval.Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no sign of backing down for his demands to annex the entire territory of the industrial eastern region of Donbas.His troops have been making slow progress in the past few months.",

    "body": "1 hour agoDanny AeberhardandRachel HaganUS President Donald Trump has withdrawn the US from dozens of international organisations, including many that work to combat climate change.Nearly half of the 66 affected bodies are UN-related, including the Framework Convention on Climate Change - a treaty that underpins all international efforts to combat global warming.Groups working on development, gender equality and conflict - areas the Trump administration had repeatedly dismissed as advancing \"globalist\" or \"woke\" agendas  - are also included. The White House said the decision was taken because those entities \"no longer serve American interests\" and promote \"ineffective or hostile agendas\".The memorandum was signed on Wednesday after a review into causes that the White House said were \"a waste of taxpayer dollars\".\"These withdrawals will end American taxpayer funding and involvement in entities that advance globalist agendas over US priorities,\" it said in a statement.It added that many of the organisations promoted \"radical climate policies, global governance and ideological programs that conflict with US sovereignty and economic strength\".As well as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the US has also withdrawn from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the world's leading authority on climate science.Non-UN organisations affected include those focused on clean energy cooperation, democratic governance and international security, such as the International Solar Alliance, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance and the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum. Trump has already stripped many multilateral organisations he dislikes of funds and previously rejected the scientific consensus of man-made climate change as a \"hoax\".While the US Constitution allows presidents to join treaties \"provided two thirds of Senators present concur\", it does not specify what happens if they were to withdraw, which means Trump's move could face legal challenges.These latest withdrawals come after the president last year withdrew the US from the Paris Climate Agreement for a second time, and declined to send a delegation to the COP30 climate summit in Brazil. The US has also already withdrawn from the World Health Organization, the UN Human Rights Council and the UN's cultural agency, UNESCO.European leaders have criticised this latest decision, warning it would weaken global cooperation. EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said the UNFCCC \"underpins global climate action\" and called the US retreat \"regrettable and unfortunate\", while the EU's clean transition vice-president Teresa Ribera said the administration showed little concern for the environment, health or human suffering.A member of a US-based non-profit advocacy group, the Union of Concerned Scientists, described the step as a \"new low\".Senior policy director Rachel Cleetus told the AFP news agency it was another sign that the administration, which she described as \"authoritarian\" and \"anti- science\", was determined to sacrifice people's wellbeing and destabilise global cooperation.",

    "body": "10 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterPresident Donald Trump has called for US defence spending to be increased to $1.5tn (£1.1tn) in 2027 for what he called \"these very troubled and dangerous times\".That would be more than 50% higher than this year's $901bn budget, which was approved by Congress in December.\"This will allow us to build the 'Dream Military' that we have long been entitled to and, more importantly, that will keep us SAFE and SECURE, regardless of foe,\" Trump said on social media on Wednesday.In separate posts, the president said he would crack down on payouts to bosses and shareholders of major US defence contractors unless the firms speed up deliveries of armaments and build new manufacturing plants.Shares in major US defence equipment makers Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon rose by more than 5% in extended trading in New York trade after Trump made the announcements.Economists have previously warned that the gap between US spending and its income has reached unsustainable levels.But Trump said Washington can \"easily hit\" his proposed $1.5tn defence budget thanks to money being brought in by tariffs.Trump has been pushing for higher defence spending by the US and its allies since his first term in the White House.He said in another post on Wednesday that military equipment is not being made quickly enough and urged companies to build new and modern plants.Defence companies are issuing \"massive\" payouts to shareholders and stock buybacks at the expense of investing into production, Trump said. He also criticised the \"exorbitant\" pay packages of executives at arms manufacturers.\"No Executive should be allowed to make in excess of $5 Million Dollars which, as high as it sounds, is a mere fraction of what they are making now.\"In a separate post, Trump singled out Raytheon, saying it was the \"least responsive\" to America's defence needs and the slowest to increase production.\"Either Raytheon steps up and starts investing in more upfront Investment like Plants and Equipment, or they will no longer be doing business with the Department of War,\" Trump wrote in a separate post.The BBC has contacted Raytheon for comment.Trump's call for much higher defence spending comes as geo-political tensions have increased around the world.On Wednesday, the US military captured a Russian-flagged oil tanker suspected to have violated US sanctions.It came after US forces seized Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro at the weekend and took him to America to face drug trafficking charges.In December, China held military drills around Taiwan simulating the seizure and blockade of the island's key areas, as a warning against \"separatist forces\".Taiwan's push to ramp up its defence this year has also angered Beijing, which claims the self-ruled island as its territory.",

    "body": "A spell of freezing weather bringing heavy snowfall and ice has caused transport disruption across western Europe.Hundreds of flights have been cancelled at several airports, while Eurostar services and haulage have also been affected.More than 700 flights were cancelled at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, a major regional transport hub, on Wednesday. Meanwhile, France's civil aviation authority has asked airlines to cut 40% of flights scheduled for the main international airport in Paris.At least six people have died in weather-related incidents across Europe this week -five in France and one in Bosnia.Dutch national airline KLM warned Schiphol Airport was close to running out of de-icing fluid after days of freezing conditions.Spokesperson Stephan Donker told news agency Reuters that it was an \"exceptional situation\" at the Dutch airport, where more than 1,000 travellers spent the night.A few hundred beds have been set up there before and after security checks with food and drinks also provided, he said.Donker warned of knock-on effects from the disruption, with further delays and cancellations possible in coming days.In Paris, more than 100 flights were cancelled at Charles de Gaulle airport and 40 more at Orly.Dozens of fllights have been delayed or cancelled in and out of Heathrow and Brussels.Some Eurostar rail services between London and Paris were delayed or cancelled on Wednesday. Almost half of mainland France was on alert for heavy snow and black ice, with lorries banned from the roads in some areas.\"It's better to be here than stuck on the road,\" driver Carle Bruno told news agency AFP at a roadside service station in the northern port of Le Havre.Five people died in two separate regions of France earlier this week as a result of treacherous driving conditions, authorities said, while a woman was also killed in Bosnia's capital, Sarajevo, after 40cm (16in) of snow fell on the city.In Paris, Guinean teenager Boubacar Camara, sleeping in a tent on the outskirts of the city, told AFP he had \"no choice but to keep on going\".\"You just have to stay strong [and] make sure you don't die,\" the 19-year-old said. \"We can't do anything about the cold. I'm not used to this at all.\"The rare sight of the French capital covered in snow drew residents and tourists out to ski down the slopes of Montmartre and along the Champs de Mars gardens below the Eiffel Tower.\"It's exceptional, it's incredible,\" said Pierre, a Parisian. \"It's magnificent and we're enjoying it. We also came across a lot of tourists and they look so happy.\" ",

    "body": "The US has suspended all assistance to the government of Somalia, alleging that officials destroyed a UN World Food Programme (WFP) warehouse and seized \"donor-funded food aid\".\"The Trump administration has a zero-tolerance policy for waste, theft, and diversion of life-saving assistance,\" said a US state department statement on X.The message, posted on the account of the under secretary for foreign assistance, said reports had been received about officials illegally seizing 76 tonnes of food intended for \"vulnerable Somalis\".Any resumption of assistance would depend on the Somali government \"taking accountability for its unacceptable actions and taking appropriate remedial steps\", it said.Although the US has withdrawn from several UN organisations under President Donald Trump, it remains by far the largest contributor to the WFP, paying $2bn (£1.5bn) in 2025 - almost a third of its total funding.The Somali government, which has long been battling al-Qaeda-linked Islamist militants as it tries to rebuild the country after a devastating civil war and years of drought, has yet to comment.This is the latest example of the deteriorating relations between Washington and Mogadishu.Last month, Trump lashed out at Somali migrants living in the US, telling reporters they should \"go back to where they came from\" and \"their country is no good for a reason\".Communities have been targeted in immigration raids as the government alleges large-scale benefit fraud in Minnesota, the US state with the largest Somali community in the US.The recent recognition by US ally Israel of the breakaway republic of Somaliland, which Somalia considers to be part of its territory, has further angered Mogadishu.The aid that was allegedly seized by Somali officials was meant to help people cope with the effects of \"drought, floods, conflict, high food prices and dwindling harvests\", according to the WFP.It quotes figures saying that 4.6 million people in Somalia are facing crisis levels of hunger.",

The accused has a brother and sister.When asked by the judge if he understood that he was waiving his right to enter a plea on Wednesday, Reiner said: \"Yeah, I agree with it.\"The defendant smiled a few times during the hearing as he spoke to sheriffs' deputies.His new lawyer, public defender Kimberly Greene, met Reiner and asked for time to prepare for the case before her new client entered a plea.The next hearing is set for 23 February.Rob Reiner, 78, directed a handful of iconic films in a variety of genres, including This is Spinal Tap, Misery and A Few Good Men.Michele Singer Reiner, 70, was an actress, photographer and producer.Watch: \"I'm learning about being a parent\" - Rob Reiner talks to the BBC's Tim Sebastian in 1998",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has said he will meet his Colombian counterpart Gustavo Petro at the White House in the \"near future\", just days after saying an operation targeting Colombia \"sounds good\". The US seized the president of neighbouring Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, in a raid on Caracas on Saturday night.Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said on Wednesday the death toll in the raid was substantially higher than initially reported, with more than 100 people killed.Local media had previously reported that 23 Venezuelan and 32 Cuban soldiers died when US forces stormed Maduro's compound. During a call with Trump, Petro explained \"the situation of drugs and other disagreements\", the US president said, adding he appreciated the Colombian president's \"tone\". Earlier this week, Trump had issued a warning to Petro, telling him to \"watch his ass\".Colombia is a key hub for the region's drug trade - most notably cocaine - as well as having substantial oil reserves. It is also a major producer of gold, silver, emeralds, platinum and coal. The US has said it will control sales of Venezuelan oil \"indefinitely\" as it prepares to roll back restrictions on the country's crude in global markets, according to the White House.Speaking aboard Air Force One following the operation in Venezuela, Trump described Petro as a \"sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States\". Trump added: \"He's not going to be doing it for very long.\"In response, Petro warned that Colombia would \"take up arms\" if the US launched any military action against his country.\"If you detain a president whom much of my people want and respect, you will unleash the people's jaguar,\" Petro wrote on X.But writing on his Truth Social platform late on Wednesday, Trump described his conversation with Petro as a \"Great Honor\", and said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Colombian counterpart would make arrangements for Petro to travel to Washington.The US imposed sanctions on Petro in October, saying he was failing to curb drug trafficking and was allowing cartels to \"flourish\".At the time, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that since Petro came to power in 2022, cocaine production in Colombia had \"exploded to the highest rate in decades, flooding the United States and poisoning Americans\".Petro responded he had been fighting drug trafficking \"for decades\" and that his administration had stemmed the growth of coca crops.Like Venezuela, Colombia is home to substantial oil reserves.Meanwhile, Venezuela's interim president Delcy Rodríguez said the US action to depose Maduro was a \"stain on our relations such as had never occurred in our history\". But she added: \"Venezuela is open to energy relations where all parties benefit.\"",

    "body": "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced a royal commission, the country's most powerful form of independent inquiry, into last month's shooting at Bondi Beach. The attack targeting a Jewish festival left 15 people dead, making it one of the deadliest in the country's history.Albanese had previously argued that reforms on gun ownership and hate speech, steps to tackle antisemitism and a review into intelligence and law enforcement agencies offered the quickest response.But following weeks of public pressure, he said on Thursday that a royal commission was the best way forward after he had taken \"the time to reflect\" and meet with the Jewish community.\"I've repeatedly said that our government's priority is to promote unity and social cohesion, and this is what Australia needs to heal, to learn, to come together in a spirit of national unity,\" he told reporters in Canberra. \"It's clear to me that a royal commission is essential to achieving this.\"Since the 14 December attack, the families of the victims, as well as a chorus of public figures, including lawyers, business people and athletes had led an almost daily campaign calling for him to reverse course and launch a royal commission.A royal commission has broad powers to investigate, the ability to summon witnesses and compel agencies to produce documents. It can also offer legal protections to whistleblowers.The commission will examine four key areas, Albanese said. They comprise:investigating the \"nature and prevalence of antisemitism\" and its \"key drivers\" in Australiamaking recommendations to enforcement, border immigration and security agencies to tackle antisemitism examining the circumstances surrounding the Bondi attackmaking any other recommendations for strengthening social cohesion and countering the spread of ideological and religiously motivated extremismThe prime minister said the work of Dennis Richardson, the former spy chief leading a review into intelligence and law enforcement agencies, would be wrapped into the royal commission, with an interim report expected in April.Former High Court justice Virginia Bell has been appointed to lead the commission, Albanese said, adding that he had asked her to report by December 2026 and that \"this won't be a drawn-out process.\" Previous royal commissions have taken years.\"This royal commission is the right format, the right duration and the right terms of reference to deliver the right outcome for our national unity and our national security,\" Albanese said.Rumours that Bell was to be appointed had earlier drawn criticism from the Jewish community. Former treasurer Josh Frydenberg said prior to Albanese's announcement the prime minister had been told by Jewish leaders there were \"serious concerns\" about her appointment, without specifying what they were.Speaking alongside Albanese, Attorney General Michelle Rowland said Bell was \"an eminent and highly capable former Justice of the High Court of Australia, and I have no doubt that she will examine the complex issues ahead with impartiality and precision\".Addressing concerns that a royal commission could interfere with the criminal legal proceedings against the alleged gunman who survived, Albanese added: \"It's one of the reasons why we chose someone who has a criminal law background, has been in senior positions in the Supreme Court and the High Court of Australia. That is, she's the most qualified person we could possibly consider.\"He also added that the inquiry was not meant to \"provide a solution on Gaza or on the Middle East\".\"The truth is that some people have held Jewish Australians to account for views or actions that that they're opposed to, that have nothing to do with them,\" Albanese said.In the days after the attack, state and federal leaders agreed to tighten gun controls, including limits on the number of firearms held by any one individual and on the types of firearms that can be held, as well as a buyback scheme.Albanese also promised hate speech reform including penalties for preachers and leaders who promote violence and a new federal offence of \"aggravated hate speech\".He previously said his government would adopt the recommendations put forward by antisemitism commissioner Jillian Segal in a July report.Her report was criticised by some upon its release due to its implications for free speech, such as plans to monitor universities and arts organisations and withhold funding if they were deemed to have failed to act against antisemitism.Speaking alongside the prime minister on Thursday, Segal said the government's decision was \"the right one and an important one\". \"It does reflect the seriousness of the growth in antisemitism and its impact on our country and our democracy,\" she said.",

    "body": "A pair of twin mountain gorillas has been born in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo - a rare occurrence for the endangered primates, conservationists at Virunga National Park say.The community trackers, who discovered 22-year-old Mafuko hugging her newborns on Saturday, said the mother and her two baby sons all appeared to be well and healthy. Twin births are thought to account for about 1% of all mountain gorilla births, though exact data is not widely available.Virunga, situated in a conflict-prone part of DR Congo, is Africa's oldest and largest national park and was set up 100 years ago to protect mountain gorillas of which there are fewer than 1,100 left in the wild.They are only found in the Virunga and in national parks over the border in Rwanda and Uganda, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which compiles a Red List of threatened species.The last birth of mountain gorilla twins in Virunga National Park was in September 2020.Mafuko herself gave birth to twins in 2016, but they both died within a week.Young gorillas rely entirely on their mothers for care and transport - and are extremely vulnerable in what can be a dangerous environment where poachers and many armed groups operate.The authorities at the park say additional monitoring and protection measures have been put in place to ensure the twins' survival during this critical period. Rangers would closely observe the young family and provide support if needed, they said.A gorilla's pregnancy lasts for about eight-and-a-half months, and females usually give birth to one infant every four years. According to Virunga conservationists, Mafuko has had a remarkable history of survival herself.Born in 2003 into the Kabirizi family, she lost her mother to armed attackers when she was four years old. She joined the Bageni family when she was 10 - and to date has been pregnant and given birth five times.Conservationists at Virunga, which is a Unesco World Heritage Site, say her latest offspring represent a significant boost for efforts to protect the endangered species.Thanks to anti-poaching patrols and community programmes - supported by the European Union and Unesco - mountain gorilla numbers in Virunga have slowly increased over the past decade.This success, which is documented by the IUCN and other partners, led to their status being upgraded from \"critically endangered\" to \"endangered\" in 2018.Virunga spans 7,800 sq km (3,000 sq miles) and is home to an astonishingly diverse landscape - from active volcanoes and vast lakes to rainforest and mountains.",

    "body": "Influential China church reports arrests as crackdown on Christians intensifies1 hour agoKelly NgWatch: Video appears to show part of Yayang Church being taken downAn influential Protestant church in China says prominent leaders were arrested in what appears to be a growing crackdown on the underground church movement.Nine people were detained on Tuesday after police raided their homes and the church office in Chengdu, the Early Rain Covenant Church said. Five of them had been released by Wednesday.More than 1,000 miles away in Wenzhou, authorities began demolishing the Yayang Church building, as seen in video obtained by the non-profit ChinaAid, which monitors religious persecution.This latest wave of arrests, after others last year, shows the Communist Party's resolve to snuff out churches that do not align with its ideology, Christian groups say.The BBC has contacted China's embassy in the UK for comment. Authorities have not made any statements about the arrests, or the demolition in Wenzhou.China promotes atheism and controls religion. The government said in 2018 there are 44 million Christians in the country, but it's unclear if that number includes those who attend the many underground churches.The Party has long pressured Christians to join only state-sanctioned churches led by government-approved pastors. But Christian groups say the grip has tightened noticeably, with arrests becoming more common and prompt. At least two church leaders in China have told the BBC that authorities are swiftly arresting unauthorised church leaders, while in the past, these individuals would first be warned, then fined and finally detained if they still refuse to comply with orders.Getty ImagesUnder Xi Jinping, China has tightened its grip on religious freedomJust weeks ago, Li Yingqiang, the current leader of Early Rain Covenant Church, had said he \"sensed a storm gathering\" and referred to \"the imminent prospect of... another large-scale crackdown\".\"I dearly hope that none of our families shall ever again endure such a storm. Yet as an elder appointed by the Lord to stand among you... it is my duty to remind you all to prepare yourselves before the storm returns,\" he wrote in a letter to church members in November.Li and his wife Zhang Xinyue are among the four who remain in detention. Their church described the arrests as a \"concerted operation\" but said the grounds for arrest, and whether those detained have been charged, remain unclear. It added that it had lost contact with two other members but did not say they had been detained.\"The situation is ongoing, with specific details yet to be fully confirmed,\" Early Rain Covenant Church (ERCC) said in a statement to members and supporters. It also also sought prayers for its members' safety and their perseverance in the Christian faith.In Wenzhou, local authorities brought in bulldozers, cranes and heavy machinery earlier this week, and started taking down part of the Yayang Church building, as seen in the video. ChinaAid said it was told by multiple sources that hundreds of armed and special police officers have been deployed to stand guard outside the building.Sometimes known as \"the Jerusalem of China\", Wenzhou has more Christians than any other city in the country. Residents living near Yayang Church have been \"driven away\", while those working in the area has been instructed not to take photographs or record video, ChinaAid said.\"The massive mobilisation against the two major independent church networks shows the central government is determined to stamp out Christian churches entirely, unless the church is totally indoctrinated into the party's ideology,\" said Bob Fu, who founded ChinaAid.ChinaAidLocal authorities have started taking down part of Yayang Church's buildingIn December, authorities arrested about 100 members of Yayang Church in Wenzhou over five days. At least 24 members remain in custody, according to Human Rights Watch. And in October last year 30 leaders of Zion Church, one of China's biggest underground churches, were rounded up across seven cities. Founder Ezra Jin is still in custody.The Chinese government has also targeted the Early Rain Covenant Church, founded in 2008, for years. In 2018, authorities raided the church and arrested founding pastor Wang Yi and his wife Jiang Rong. At least 100 church members were taken into custody in the following days in one of China's largest crackdowns on churches in the past decade.Wang, an outspoken critic of the Communist Party's policies on religion, was jailed for \"inciting subversion of state power\" and \"illegal business operations\". He is due to be released in 2027.The church has continued to gather online and sometimes replays Wang's recorded sermons to its members.\"Xi Jinping's government has tightened ideological control and intensified its intolerance of loyalties beyond the Chinese Communist Party,\" said Yalkun Uluyol, China researcher at Human Rights Watch.\"Concerned governments and religious leaders around the world should press the Chinese government to free detained religious adherents and respect religious freedom in China,\" Uluyol added.Under Xi, China has increased its control on religious freedom. Since 2015, he has called for the \"Sinicisation of religions\" which requires religious doctrines and practices to conform with Chinese culture and values. Last year, authorities banned clergy of all religions from preaching live on social media, organising online activities for children, and raising funds online, unless these are carried out on government-approved platforms.",

    "description": "US President Donald Trump and his officials are \"actively\" discussing a potential offer to buy the Danish territory of Greenland, the White House has ",
    "body": "US President Donald Trump and his officials are \"actively\" discussing a potential offer to buy the Danish territory of Greenland, the White House has confirmed.It is \"something that's currently being actively discussed by the president and his national security team\", White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Wednesday.Both Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly stressed the island was not for sale.Asked why the Trump administration had previously said it was not ruling out using military force to acquire Greenland, Leavitt replied that all options were always on the table but Trump's \"first option always has been diplomacy\".Concerns over the future of the territory resurfaced after Trump's unilateral use of military force against Venezuela on Saturday to seize its President Nicolás Maduro. Denmark, a fellow Nato ally, says an attack on its territory would end the military alliance. The Trump administration says Greenland is vital to US security. Despite being the most sparsely populated territory, its location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks, and for monitoring vessels in the region.Pituffik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base, has been operated by the US since World War 2.In recent years, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources, including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron that are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. Scientists think it could also have significant oil and gas reserves.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that he will hold talks with Denmark next week.Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, during his first presidential term, only to be told it was not for sale.\"The acquisition of Greenland by the United States is not a new idea,\" Leavitt said.\"The president has been very open and clear with all of you and with the world, that he views it in the best interest of the United States to deter Russian and Chinese aggression in the Arctic region, and so that's why his team is currently talking about what a potential purchase would look like.\"The White House said earlier this week that Trump had been discussing a range of options to acquire Greenland, including using military force.\"All options are always on the table for President Trump as he examines what's in the best interests of the United States,\" Leavitt said.Earlier in the day, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said Rubio had \"ruled out the possibility of an invasion\" of Greenland in a phone call with him.Barrot is due to discuss the Arctic island with his German and Polish counterparts later on Wednesday.On Tuesday, European leaders issued a joint statement rallying behind Denmark.\"Greenland belongs to its people, and only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations,\" the leaders of France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark said in a joint statement.Stressing they were as keen as the US on Arctic security, the European signatories said this must be achieved by Nato allies, including the US, \"collectively\".They also called for \"upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders\".A day after the US military action in Venezuela, Katie Miller, the wife of one of Trump's senior aides, posted a map on social media of Greenland in the colours of the US flag, alongside the word \"SOON\".On Monday, her husband, Stephen Miller, said it was \"the formal position of the US government that Greenland should be part of the US\".Aaja Chemnitz, one of two MPs in the Danish parliament representing Greenland, told the BBC that the comments from the Trump administration were \"a clear threat\".\"It's completely disrespectful from the US side to not rule out annexing our country and to annex another Nato ally,\" she said.But Chemnitz said she saw this as unlikely - instead, \"what we are going to see is that they will put pressure on us in order to make sure that they will take over Greenland over time\".Aleqatsiaq Peary, a 42-year-old Inuit hunter living in Greenland's remote northerly town of Qaanaaq, appeared indifferent to the potential of US ownership.\"It would be switching from one master to another, from one occupier to another,\" he told the BBC. \"We are a colony under Denmark. We are already losing a lot from being under the Danish government.\"Saying that he did not have \"time for Trump\", he added that people were \"in need\". Hunters like him, he explained, hunted with dogs on the sea ice and fish \"but the sea ice is melting and hunters cannot make a living anymore\".Additional reporting by Adrienne Murray in Copenhagen",

    "body": "5 hours agoStephen McDonellChina correspondent andNick Edserbusiness reporterDonald Trump's latest threat to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods is \"a typical example of US double standards\", China's government has said.A commerce ministry spokesperson also said China could introduce its own unspecified \"countermeasures\" if the US president carries out his threat, adding it was \"not afraid\" of a possible trade war.On Friday, Trump hit back at Beijing's move to tighten its rules for rare earths exports, accusing it  of \"becoming very hostile\" and trying to hold the world \"captive\". He also threatened to pull out of a meeting with China's President Xi Jinping later this month.But on Sunday, Trump wrote: \"Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!\" \"Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn't want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!\" Trump said in a post on social media, without elaborating further. Trump's comments on Friday rattled financial markets, with the S&P 500 share index closing down 2.7%, its steepest fall since April.On Monday, the Shenzhen Composite Index in mainland China closed 0.74% lower, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 1.5%.The president's words renewed fears of a trade war between the US and China.In May, the two sides had agreed to drop triple-digit tariffs on each others' goods. which had raised the prospect of trade halting between the two countries.This left US tariffs on Chinese goods facing an added 30% levy compared with the start of the year, while US goods entering China face a 10% tariff.China's response - released by the commerce ministry in the form of written responses to journalist's questions - echoed language from the height of the recent trade conflict.They criticised US export restrictions on chips and semi-conductors as well as defending China's own export controls on rare earths as \"normal actions\" to safeguard national security and that of all nations.The spokesperson said that for \"a long time\", the US had \"overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures\" and \"adopted discriminatory practices against China\".\"Resorting to tariff threats is not the right way to engage with China,\" the spokesperson said.\"China's position on a tariff war has always been consistent: we do not want one, but we are not afraid of one.\"Last week, China announced it was tightening export controls on rare earths and other materials critical for advanced tech manufacturing.This was seen as key move, as the country processes about 90% of the world's rare earths, which are used in goods such as solar panels and smartphones.The recent comments from Washington and Beijing are being seen by some as a means of strengthening positions ahead of future trade talks.It is unclear whether a meeting between Trump and Xi, expected at a summit in South Korea later this month, will still proceed.",

Both countries suspended visa services and expelled each other's top diplomats.Canada is home to nearly 1.7 million people of Indian origin and the developments were being watched anxiously in both countries.After the meeting of their foreign ministers in Delhi, the two sides announced a series of measures, including starting ministerial-level discussions on bilateral trade and investment.\"Reviving this partnership will not only create opportunities for enhanced economic cooperation but also help mitigate vulnerabilities arising from shifting global alliances,\" a joint statement said.Signs of a thaw have appeared this year since Mark Carney took over as Canadian prime minister.In June, Carney and Modi held a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Canada. Two months later, the countries appointed new high commissioners to each other's countries.Anand and Jaishankar also met each other on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly session in New York in September.X/MEAJaishankar said India-Canada ties had been making steady progressOn Monday, Jaishankar said that India-Canada bilateral relations have been steadily progressing in the last few months.\"When we look at Canada, we see a complementary economy. We see another open society. We see diversity and pluralism,\" he said, adding that this was \"the basis for a close sustainable and long-term co-operative framework\".\"We are collectively committed to advancing this relationship now and in the long term, particularly when it comes to our mutual priorities in the Indo-Pacific,\" Anand said.The two countries will resume the Canadaâ€“India CEO Forum, which brings together executives from both countries to increase bilateral trade and investment. The announcement comes as Delhi deals with a punitive 50% tariff imposed by US President Donald Trump on Indian goods.Anand is also set to meet India's Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal to discuss boosting trade ties, before visiting Mumbai to speak to business leaders about investments and economic opportunities.She will then travel to China and Singapore as part of Canada's Indo-Pacific strategy that focuses on deepening the country's engagement in the region.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",

The two are due to appear in court on Monday.Police said they were alerted to the shooting and on arrival at the scene discovered the body of a man believed to be in his 30s lying on his side with a gunshot wound. He was declared dead at the scene.Saturday's shooting in Thabazimbi, Limpopo province, has renewed concern over firearm safety and parental responsibility in the country. The firearm was seized as evidence.\"This heart-breaking incident serves as a reminder that firearms must be handled with the utmost care and stored securely at all times,\" Limpopo police chief Thembi Hadebe said.She added that parents and guardians have a responsibility to ensure that \"children do not have access to firearms under any circumstances\".Local media report that the incident has deeply shocked the local farming community and raised public concern about the risks of children accessing weapons in rural households.Earlier this month, police said they had opened a murder charge against an eight-year-old boy after he fatally shot his seven-year-old cousin with his father's firearm in Eastern Cape province.His 48-year-old father was charged with failure to safeguard the firearm.More about South Africa from the BBC:South Africa's deadly love affair with gunsShamans openly using psychedelic drugs for treatment in South AfricaSouth African firebrand MP Malema convicted of firing a gun in publicTop policeman shakes South Africa with explosive allegationsSouth Africa gun crime: 'Every night there are bullets'Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "24 hours agoMartin MwangiBBC MonitoringMali has announced that US nationals visiting the West African country will be required to post a bond of up to $10,000 (Â£7,500) for business and tourist visas, in response to a similar requirement the Trump administration has imposed on its citizens.The US embassy in Mali said on Friday the fee had been introduced to reinforce Washington's \"commitment to protecting America's borders and safeguarding US national security\".Mali's foreign ministry said on Sunday the bond had been imposed unilaterally, and it had decided to \"establish an identical visa programme\" for US citizens.The visa policy shift comes despite moves to improve diplomatic relations between the two countries.In July, US officials visited Mali to discuss counterterrorism cooperation and economic partnerships, including potential access to Mali's gold and lithium reserves.Relations deteriorated after a coup in Mali in 2021 led to Gen Assimi GoÃ¯ta sweeping to power. He pivoted the West African state towards Russia in a bid to stem a growing insurgency by jihadists. He expelled French troops, and brought in mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group, which is under Moscow's defence ministry. They have since been replaced by Africa Corps. Last week, Burkina Faso's military government refused to take in deportees from the US, as Washington suspended issuing visas in the West African nation.Foreign affairs minister Karamoko Jean-Marie TraorÃ© questioned if the embassy's decision was \"blackmail\" after he said he had rejected a US proposal to take in migrants from third countries.The Trump administration has turned to African countries as a destination to deport migrants to as part of its crackdown on immigration.",

The election went to a run-off after neither candidate won an outright majority in the first round two weeks ago.A former parliamentary speaker, Herminie was charged with witchcraft in 2023 in what he said was a politically motivated attempt to thwart his presidential ambitions. The charges were dropped in 2024, paving the way for him to run for office. \"I will be the president of all Seychellois, and I will end divisions by ceasing preferences and giving everyone the opportunity to thrive,\" Herminie said in his victory speech. Ramkalawan is the latest incumbent to lose elections in Africa, with Malawi's President Lazarus Chakwera voted out of power last month amid growing discontent with the rising cost of living.Herminie's party, United Seychelles (US), won parliamentary elections with a solid majority last month, regaining control after previously losing it to Rakalawan's Linyon Demokratik Seselwa (LDS).",

    "body": "For over two months, Paramjit Singh, 48, a US green card holder battling a brain tumour and a heart condition, has been held in a detention centre by US immigration authorities.Mr Singh, an Indian passport holder, has lived in the US on a green card since 1994. He lives in Indiana with his family, who own a chain of gas stations. His wife and two children are US citizens.But Mr Singh now faces the threat of deportation. On 30 July, he was detained by immigration authorities at Chicago O'Hare International Airport while returning from a trip to India and has since been in their custody.US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) authorities have cited two decades-old cases as reasons for his detention, but Mr Singh's family and lawyer say there are no active cases against him. They accuse immigration authorities of using old cases to delay his release and allege he lacks proper medical care despite a brain tumour and heart condition.\"Paramjit Singh is not getting the medical help he needs. He is only getting medical check-ups,\" his lawyer, Louis Angeles, told the BBC.The BBC has asked ICE for a response to these allegations.Mr Singh has regularly visited India without immigration issues, his niece Kiran Virk told the BBC. This time, his family waited seven hours at Chicago airport for his arrival.Ms Virk says immigration officials told them Mr Singh was detained over a 1999 case. He was held at the airport for five days despite family appeals, before being moved to a Clay County detention centre in Indiana.The case involves Mr Singh using a public phone without paying. Court records show he served 10 days in prison and paid a $4,137.50 fine. The conviction has blocked his US citizenship.Ms Virk alleges immigration authorities said at a court hearing that Mr Singh still faced a one-and-a-half-year sentence, with only 10 days dismissed.Immigration authorities also say that Mr Singh was convicted of a forgery offence in Illinois in 2008, but his family contends that there are no such charges against him.Ms Virk said that the authorities cited the forgery case to stay Mr Singh's release on a $10,000 bond granted by an immigration judge.She said a private detective hired by the family found no criminal records for a person named Paramjit Singh in the state, suggesting authorities may have mistaken him for someone else.The BBC has asked ICE for a response to the family's claim that there is no forgery case against Mr Singh in Illinois.Sikh granny's arrest by US immigration sparks community angerWoman, 73, deported by ICE to India after three decades in USMr Singh's lawyer told the BBC he plans to challenge the detention, calling it \"unethical\".\"We are also taking legal steps to block him from being deported from the US,\" Mr Angeles told the BBC.Meanwhile, Mr Singh's family is increasingly worried about his health, as his second brain tumour surgery has been delayed due to detention, Ms Virk says.She says the family struggles to contact Mr Singh at the detention centre, where limited phones and his poor health make communication difficult.Mr Singh's case is set to be heard on 14 October. His detention comes amid a wider crackdown by US President Donald Trump's administration on immigration, and especially illegal immigrants in the US.Trump has said he wants to deport the \"worst of the worst\", but critics say immigrants without criminal records who follow due process have also been targeted.In September, Harjit Kaur, a 73-year-old grandmother who spent more than three decades living in the US was deported to India, sparking anger among the Sikh community.

    "body": "7 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterThe Dutch government has taken control of Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands, in a bid to safeguard the European supply of semiconductors for cars and other electronic goods and protect Europe's economic security.The Hague said it took the decision due to \"serious governance shortcomings\" and to prevent the chips from becoming unavailable in an emergency.Nexperia's owner Wingtech said on Monday that it would take actions to protect its rights and would seek government support.The development threatens to raise tensions between the European Union and China, which have increased in recent months over trade and Beijing's relationship with Russia.In December 2024, the US government placed Wingtech on its so-called \"entity list\", identifying the company as a national security concern. Under the regulations, US companies are barred from exporting American-made goods to businesses on the list unless they have special approval.In the UK, Nexperia was forced to sell its silicon chip plant in Newport, after MPs and ministers expressed national security concerns. It currently owns a UK facility in Stockport.The Dutch Economic Ministry said it made the \"highly exceptional\" decision to invoke the Goods Availability Act over \"acute signals of serious governance shortcomings\" within Nexperia.\"These signals posed a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities,\" the ministry said in a statement.\"Losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security.\"The statement did not detail why it thought the firm's operations were risky. A spokesperson for the minister of economic affairs told the BBC there was no further information to share.The Goods Availability Act is designed to allow the Hague to intervene in companies under exceptional circumstances. These include threats to the country's economic security and to ensure the supply of critical goods.Under the order, the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs, Vincent Karremans, could reverse or block Nexperia's decisions if they were potentially harmful to the company's interests, to its future as a business in the Netherlands or Europe, or to ensure supply remains available in an emergency.The Dutch government added the company's production can continue as normal.\"This measure is intended to mitigate that risk,\" the ministry said.Shanghai-listed shares in Nexperia's parent company Wingtech fell by 10% on Monday morning.A Nexperia spokesperson said the company \"complies with all existing laws and regulations, export controls and sanctions regimes,\" and had no further comment.In a statement in Mandarin, Wingtech said its operations were continuing uninterrupted and it remained in close communication with its suppliers and customers.Wingtech said in a stock filing that the company's chairman, Zhang Xuezheng, was suspended from Nexperia's boards by an Amsterdam court order earlier this month.The company was also in talks with lawyers about potential legal remedies, it added.The BBC has also contacted the Chinese embassies in the Netherlands and Brussels.",

    "body": "24 minutes agoJames FitzGeraldWatch: 'It will be a golden age for the Middle East' - TrumpUS President Donald Trump has told cheering Israeli lawmakers that \"the long and painful nightmare is finally over\", after helping to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.During the first such address by a US president since 2008, Trump said the day would mark \"the moment that everything began to change, and change very much for the better\" in the Middle East.Trump's address to the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, comes on the day that the last 20 living hostages held in the Palestinian enclave were released by Hamas. Israel is releasing 250 Palestinian prisoners and more than 1,700 other Palestinians detained during the two-year military operations in Gaza.During a whirlwind trip to the region, Trump is also attending a peace summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, alongside Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and other world leaders.After arriving in Egypt, he said the second phase of negotiations on a peace agreement were under way.During his address to the Knesset earlier in the day, the American president suggested the region was experiencing \"the historic dawn of a new Middle East\". His words echoed the phrasing he used when Israel signed landmark deals with several Arab states during his first presidency.\"At last, not only for Israelis but also Palestinians, the long and painful nightmare is finally over,\" Trump said.Adding to the jubilant atmosphere in the room were politicians' chants of \"Trump, Trump, Trump\". The ceasefire that he helped to broker was \"the most challenging breakthrough of them all, the most challenging breakthrough maybe ever\", the US leader reflected. He indicated that ending the Russia-Ukraine war would be his next focus.Trump gave an insight into some of his recent conversations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying he felt the Israeli military campaign in Gaza was becoming \"bad\" and \"heated\".\"I said, 'Bibi you're going to be remembered for this far more than if you kept this thing going, going, going, kill, kill, kill',\" Trump recalled.His speech was briefly interrupted as an opposition parliament member held up a piece of paper that said \"Recognise Palestine\". At least one person was escorted out of the room.Follow live updatesWho are the released Israeli hostages?Palestinians celebrate return of prisoners freed by IsraelWhat we know about Gaza ceasefire agreementTrump was introduced to parliament by Netanyahu, who saluted his counterpart's various acts of solidarity with Israel. Trump was the \"greatest friend\" Israel had ever had in the White House, Netanyahu said. \"Everything changed\" in the American attitude to Israel's military campaign in Gaza when Trump was re-elected as US president last year, Netanyahu added.The Israeli prime minister thanked Trump for his \"unremitting help\" in securing the return of the remaining hostages - part of a group of 251 people seized during the 7 October 2023 attacks in southern Israel by Hamas.Trump went on to offer a tribute of his own to his counterpart, saying: \"He's not the easiest guy to deal with, but that's what makes him great.\"ReutersTrump was the 'greatest friend' Israel had ever had in the White House, Netanyahu saidThe ceasefire in Gaza took effect on Friday morning after Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of Trump's 20-point peace plan. The next phases are still to be negotiated.Trump has said the ceasefire will hold, and that a \"board of peace\" he is due to head would quickly be set up to administer the territory.In his remarks to parliament, Netanyahu said he was \"committed to this peace\".Also welcomed to the Knesset alongside Trump were other key US officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. The names of Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner received particularly loud cheers from Israeli MPs, for their own roles in brokering the ceasefire. Kushner was accompanied by his wife Ivanka Trump.Members of Trump's audience wore red caps. Instead of Trump's signature slogan \"Make America Great Again\", they read \"Trump the Peace President\".Trump was told by the parliamentary speaker that there was \"no-one\" more deserving of next year's Nobel Peace Prize.But some Israeli lawmakers who want the war in Gaza to continue did not attend.Freed hostage Eitan Mor's emotional reunion with family",

    "body": "1 day agoCarrie DaviesPakistan correspondent,Stuart Lau andEthirajan AnbarasanThe Taliban government has confirmed that it attacked Pakistani troops in multiple mountainous locations on the northern border.A Taliban spokesman said 58 Pakistani military personnel had been killed in what it called \"an act of retaliation\". It claimed Pakistan had violated Afghan airspace and bombed a market inside its border on Thursday.Pakistan has disputed that figure, saying 23 of its armed forces' members had died and claiming that \"200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralized\". Pakistan's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said the Afghan attacks were \"unprovoked\" and civilians were fired at, warning that his country's forces would respond \"with a stone for every brick\".Islamabad has accused Kabul of harbouring terrorists who target Pakistan on its soil, a claim the Taliban government rejected.Both the Afghan and Pakistani sides are said to have used small arms and artillery in the Kunar-Kurram region, the BBC understands.At a press conference on Sunday, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in addition to the 58 Pakistani military deaths, around 30 others had been wounded.He added that nine Taliban fighters had died and between 16 and 18 people had been injured.Pakistan Armed Forces said 29 of its soldiers had been injured, and the number of wounded Taliban and \"affiliated\" fighters was in the hundreds.Afghanistanâ€™s foreign minister said in a press conference in New Delhi that \"we have no problems\" with Pakistan's people and its leadership but added \"there are some groups in Pakistan that are trying to spoil the situation. Afghanistan has a right to keep its territory and its borders safe, and so it has retaliated to the violation.\"Pakistan's interior minister said he \"strongly condemns\" the Taliban's attacks: \"The firing by Afghan forces on civilian populations is a blatant violation of international laws.\"Afghanistan is playing a game of fire and blood,\" he said in a post on X.The two main crossings between Pakistan and Afghanistan - Torkham in the north and Chaman in the south - have been closed, leaving hundreds of trucks carrying goods stranded on both sides. A Pakistani military spokesman said they would take necessary measures to safeguard Pakistani lives and properties.Pakistan's military has not officially commented, but a security source speaking to the BBC claimed that firing took place at several locations along the Pakistani-Afghan border, including Angoor Adda, Bajaur, Kurram, Dir, Chitral and Baramcha.A police official stationed near the Zero Point in Kurram district told the BBC that heavy weapons fire began from the Afghan side around 22:00 local time (17:00 GMT).He said they had received reports of intense gunfire from multiple locations along the border.Last week, Afghanistan's Taliban government accused Pakistan of violating Kabul's \"sovereign territory\", as two loud blasts were heard in the city late on Thursday.Pakistan bombed a civilian market in the border province of Paktika, in Afghanistan's south-east, the Taliban Defence Ministry said on Friday. Locals there told the BBC's Afghan service that a number of shops had been destroyed.A top Pakistani general alleged Afghanistan was being used as a \"base of operation for terrorism against Pakistan\". Pakistan has long accused the Afghan Taliban of permitting the Pakistan Taliban,  known as the TTP, to operate from their land and fight against the Islamabad government in a bid to enforce a strict Islamic-led system of governance. The Afghan Taliban government has always denied this.The latest escalation coincided with an historic week-long trip to India made by Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, his first since the Taliban's return to power. In a diplomatic thaw, New Delhi said that it would reopen the embassy in Kabul, which was shut four years ago.\"Afghanistan will also be given a befitting reply like India, so that it will not dare to look at Pakistan with a malicious eye,\" Naqvi warned.In a statement, Saudi Arabia, which signed a mutual defence pact with Pakistan last month, called for self-restraint and avoidance of escalation between Islamabad and Kabul.Qatar also expressed concern over the Pakistan-Afghanistan border tensions, calling on both sides to \"prioritise dialogue, diplomacy, and restraint\".",

    "body": "The US has called for the release of 30 leaders of one of China's largest underground church network who were reportedly detained over the weekend in overnight raids in various cities. The list includes several pastors and Zion Church founder Jin Mingri who was arrested in the early hours of Saturday after 10 officers searched his home, US-based non-profit ChinaAid said.The Chinese Communist Party promotes atheism and tightly controls religion - still, some Christian groups are calling this the most extensive crackdown against the faith in decades.Christians have long been pressured to join only state-sanctioned churches that are led by government-approved pastors and toe the party line. It is unclear if the detainees have been formally charged.\"Such systematic persecution is not only an affront to the Church of God but also a public challenge to the international community,\" Zion Church said in a statement.Urging China to release the church leaders, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement on Sunday that \"this crackdown further demonstrates how the CCP exercises hostility towards Christians who reject Party interference in their faith and choose to worship at unregistered house churches\". Former US vice-president Mike Pence and former secretary of state Mike Pompeo have also released statements on X condemning the arrests.When asked about the arrests at a press conference, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said he was not aware of the case.He added: \"The Chinese government governs religious affairs in accordance with the law, and protects the religious freedom of citizens and normal religious activities. We firmly oppose the US interfering in China's internal affairs with so-called religious issues.\"This could be yet another source of friction in the US-China relationship with trade tensions once again ramping up between the world's two biggest economies over tariffs and export controls. Already, there is doubt over whether a summit between US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, which was expected to happen in South Korea later this month, will proceed.Under Xi, Beijing has cracked down even more on religious freedom, especially against Christians and Muslims. At a national conference on religion in 2016, he called on the party to \"guide those [who are] religious to love their country, protect the unification of their motherland and serve the overall interests of the Chinese nation\".Despite this, there has been a growing movement of unregistered house churches in China.Among them is Zion Church, which Mr Jin started in 2007 with just 20 people. Its network now includes some 10,000 people in 40 cities across the country, making it one of the largest underground churches in China.In September 2018, the Party officially banned the church after it resisted government pressure to install security cameras at its property in Beijing. Mr Jin and several church leaders were detained briefly.Many of its branch congregations across the country have since been investigated and shut down. Mr Jin's family relocated to the US for safety, while he remained in China to pastor his flock. Authorities have barred him from leaving the country.Still the church continued to gather in small groups and shared its sermons online.ChinaAid has called this roundup of Christian leaders - which involved police across several cities - unprecedented, and the \"most extensive and coordinated wave of persecution\" against Christians in over four decades.\"This new nationwide campaign echoes the darkest days of the 1980s, when urban churches first re-emerged from the Cultural Revolution,\" said ChinaAid's founder Bob Fu, referring to a period of mass purges in the 1960s and 1970s which triggered  violence and huge upheaval across China. In a letter seeking prayers, Mr Jin's wife Liu Chunli wrote that her heart is \"filled with a mix of shock, grief, sorrow, worry, and righteous anger\". Mr Jin \"simply [did] what any faithful pastor would do... He is innocent!\" she wrote, adding that her family's hopes for a reunion after being separated for more than seven years have been dashed yet again.Several house churches in China have also issued statements calling for the release of those detained.Sean Long, a Zion Church pastor based in the US, said Mr Jin had been prepared for a crackdown of this scale.In a Zoom call weeks ago between the two pastors, Mr Long had asked what would happen if Mr Jin was put in prison and all the church's leaders detained. Mr Jin had replied: \"Hallelujah! For a new wave of revival will follow then!\"",

    "body": "Indian student captured by Ukraine joined Russian army to avoid drug charges, says mother 2 days agoGopal KateshiyaBBC Gujarati, MorbiHasina MajotiSahil Majothi had gone to Russia to study computer engineeringUkraine has captured an Indian national allegedly fighting for Russian forces, the first known Indian detained in the ongoing war.Sahil Majothi, 22, from the Indian state of Gujarat, went to Russia to study computer engineering two years ago. His mother claims he was falsely accused in a drug case last April.Mr Majothi joined the Russian army to avoid imprisonment over drug charges,  according to a video released by Ukraine's army on Tuesday.The Indian foreign ministry says it is investigating the case and has not received formal communication from Ukraine. The BBC has asked the Russian government for a response. In an interview with BBC Gujarati, Mr Majothi's mother Hasina Majothi said her son went to Russia in January 2024. He completed a three-month language course in St Petersburg before moving to Moscow for college, supporting himself part-time as a kitchenware courier.She alleges that in April 2024, someone slipped drugs into a parcel handed to Mr Majothi during his deliveries.\"The police caught him with it and charged him,\" Ms Hasina said. According to Ms Hasina, her son was detained, held for six months and later sentenced to seven years in prison. The family hired a private lawyer in Russia to defend him, but they had no idea when or how he was drafted into the military.\"I don't know how he ended up in Ukraine. I only found out through the viral video,\" Ms Hasina said.In the video released by the 63rd Mechanized Brigade of the Ukrainian army, Mr Majothi can be heard saying he was given a choice between joining the Russian army, with pay for his service, or serving jail time. He said he was told he would serve in the military for a year before being released. Mr Majothi claims that different people promised him varying amounts of money - from a hundred thousand to over a million roubles - but he never received any payment.He says he underwent 15 days of training in September 2024 and was sent to the battlefield a year later, on 30 September.The next day, on 1 October, Mr Majothi said he had an altercation with his commander, after which he separated from Russian soldiers. That was when he came across a Ukrainian dugout and asked them for help, he added.The BBC cannot independently verify the date or location of the video in which he makes these claims. Ukrainian army/FacebookMr Majothi says he underwent 15 days of training before being sent to the battlefield a year laterOn Wednesday, after the video went viral, Gujarat's Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS)  questioned Ms Hasina and her brother in Ahmedabad. Her relatives said she separated from her husband around her son's birth and supports her family as a seamstress while living with her maternal relatives.ATS officials confirmed Mr Majothi's arrest and subsequent detention in Russia. They said the family claimed to have had no contact with him since his arrest. At his former school in Morbi, teachers called Mr Majothi an \"average student\" but deeply motivated to fulfil his mother's dreams through education. They spoke on condition of anonymity.Local community leaders have also appealed to the government to intervene and secure his return. \"Many young men like him have been trapped and dragged into the war,\" said  Kasam Sumra. \"We appeal to the government to bring back Sahil and other young Indians who went abroad seeking work.\" Mr Majothi's arrest comes amid rising concerns over Indians being recruited into the Russian military. Reports say over 150 Indians, some on student or visitor visas, have enlisted. At least 12 have died in the conflict and 16 remain missing.In September, Indian officials urged Moscow to release and repatriate 27 Indian nationals who had been recruited into the army.The Indian government has consistently advised its citizens against participating in the ongoing war in Ukraine.\"We once again strongly urge all Indian nationals to stay away from offers to serve in the Russian army, as they are fraught with danger and risk to life,\" a spokesperson from India's foreign ministry said last month.Additional reporting by Roxy Gagdekar Chhara from Ahmedabad and Nikita Yadav from DelhiFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "6 hours agoHarry Sekulich andLaura GozziUS President Donald Trump is considering sending long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine.Asked by reporters on Air Force One on Sunday whether he would provide Kyiv with Tomahawks, Trump replied: \"We'll see... I may\". The missiles would be \"a new step of aggression\" in Ukraine's war with Russia, he said.The comments follow a phone call at the weekend between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who pushed for stronger military capabilities to launch counter-attacks against Russia.Moscow has previously warned Washington against providing long-range missiles to Kyiv, saying it would cause a major escalation in the conflict and strain US-Russian relations.Tomahawk missiles have a range of 2,500 km (1,500 miles), which would put Moscow within reach of Ukraine.Trump's attitude to Russia has hardened in recent months as he has become impatient with Vladimir Putin's lack of cooperation in reaching a ceasefire deal with Kyiv.  \"I might tell them [Russia] that if the war is not settled, that we may very well, [send Tomahawks to Kyiv] we may not, but we may do it,\" he said.\"Do they [Russia] want Tomahawks going in their direction? I don't think so,\" the US president added.On Sunday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the topic of Tomahawks was of \"extreme concern\" to Russia. \"Now is really a very dramatic moment in terms of the fact that tensions are escalating from all sides,\" he said.In September Peskov had dismissed the threat of Tomahawks, saying they would not be able to \"change the dynamic\" of the war.But in his comments on Sunday he noted that if Tomahawks were launched at Russia Moscow would not be able to tell whether they were carrying nuclear warheads. \"What should the Russian Federation think? Just how should Russia react?\", he said.On Monday morning former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev doubled down on Peskov's comments. \"How should Russia respond? Exactly!\" Medvedev said on social media.\"The delivery of these missiles could end badly for everyone. And first of all â€“ for Trump himself,\" he wrote.Medvedev, who over the last few years has grown into an increasingly hawkish figure, frequently posts on social media espousing more extreme positions than the Kremlin's. He and Trump have sparred online before. Comments by Medvedev in August led Trump to say he had ordered two nuclear submarines to move closer to Russia.Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, Kyiv has made multiple requests for long-range missiles, as it weighs up striking Russian cities far from the front lines of the grinding conflict.In their recent phone calls, Zelensky and Trump discussed Ukraine's bid to strengthen its military capabilities, including boosting its air defences and long-range arms. Ukrainian cities including Kyiv have repeatedly come under heavy Russian bombardment with drones and missiles. Russia has particularly targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure as winter approaches, causing widespread power cuts. Last month, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg suggested the US president had authorised strikes deep into Russian territory, telling Fox News \"there are no such things as sanctuaries\" from attacks in the Russia-Ukraine war.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "Palestinians celebrate return of prisoners freed by Israel3 hours agoTom BennettRamallah, occupied West BankEPAFamilies embraced loved ones who were returned from Israeli prisonHundreds of freed Palestinian prisoners and detainees have been welcomed with tears and screams of joy as they were released by Israel to be reunited with their families in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.The release involved about 250 prisoners who had been convicted of crimes including murder and deadly attacks against Israelis - and about 1,700 detainees from Gaza who had been held by Israel without charge. As prisoners exited a Red Cross bus in Ramallah, many draped in traditional Keffiyeh scarves, they looked pale and gaunt, with some struggling to walk.They were freed as part of an exchange in which 20 Israeli hostages were released by Hamas, with the remains of some deceased hostages also expected to be released. \"He is ready to embrace freedom,\" said Amro Abdullah, 24, who was waiting for his cousin Rashid Omar, 48, who was arrested in July 2005 and sentenced to life in prison by an Israeli court after being found guilty of murder and other crimes.\"I want peace,\" Mr Abudullah said. \"I want to live a happy life, safe and peaceful, without occupation and without restrictions.\"It is thought about 100 prisoners were released into the West Bank, with many others set to be deported and a small number freed into East Jerusalem.ReutersIsrael made clear before the release process that it wanted to avoid the jubilant scenes that surrounded prisoners arriving in Ramallah during previous hostage deals, when large crowds waved Hamas flags.Many families were reluctant to speak to the media, saying they had been warned against doing so by the Israeli military.In Gaza, families gathered at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in the hope of being reunited with their loved ones. A field hospital adjacent to the main hospital building was set up to receive them.\"This is a very beautiful feeling - happy, a day of joy,\" said Muhammad Hasan Saeed Dawood, 50, who told the BBC he was there to collect his son who he says was arrested by Israeli forces at a checkpoint.\"We call it a national holiday, that our detainees are being released despite the cost of the war, the martyrs, the injured, and the destruction in Gaza.\"Khalil Muhammad Abdulrahman Al-Qatrous, who was also there to collect his son who he said had been detained for about three months, said: \"There is joy, and there is pain, and there is happiness, and there is sorrow.\"\"We came here waiting for their release. We came here expecting them to arrive at 10:00, and now it is past 12:00, and we are still waiting, on edge.\"AFP via Getty ImagesBuses of freed Palestinian detainees arrived in Khan Younis, southern Gaza to cheers from gathered crowdsAhead of the release in Ramallah, ambulances from the Palestine Red Crescent Society set up in preparation to treat any injured prisoners.\"The crying and the silence, this shows you how the families are feeling,\" said Ibrahim Ifani, 23, a volunteer nurse for the organisation.\"For all the people in Palestine, it's a deep, deep emotion,\" he said.Multiple medics and family members said the prisoners who were released in Ramallah had faced beatings in recent days prior to their release.The BBC cannot verify claims of mistreatment in Israeli prisons. But Israel's top court said last month that Palestinian prisoners were not being given adequate food.The BBC has also previously reported on Palestinians being tortured in Israeli detention.\"Their rights were violated in the most serious ways,\" said Aya Shreiteh, 26, from the Palestinian Prisoners Club. \"Most of the prisoners in the past year were subjected to deliberate starvation and exposure to illness,\" she told the BBC.\"Their bodies are frail from starvation, and they've suffered from beatings.\"\"But today gives us hope that there will always be an inevitable freedom, no matter the circumstances,\" she added. The hostage and prisoner exchange formed part of phase one of Donald Trump's peace plan aimed at ending the war in Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.Israel launched a retaliatory military offensive which saw more than 67,682 Palestinians killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A ceasefire took hold on Friday - and negotiations are now expected to follow over the latter phases of Trump's peace plan. More on this story",

    "body": "2 days agoNorberto ParedesBBC Mundo andAlex BoydWatch: 'A great honour for Venezuelan society' - Machado speaks to the BBCNobel Peace Prize winner MarÃ­a Corina Machado has told the BBC she is grateful for what US President Donald Trump is doing \"around the world for peace\".Machado, Venezuela's opposition leader, was awarded the 2025 prize having long campaigned against the country's President NicolÃ¡s Maduro Moros, whose 12-year rule is viewed by many as illegitimate.She told BBC Mundo that during a congratulatory phone call with Trump she told him \"how grateful the Venezuelan people are for what he's doing, not only in the Americas, but around the world for peace, for freedom, for democracy\".Trump has made no secret about wanting to win the award himself, regularly speaking about the seven wars he claims to have ended.Nominations for the award closed in January, just as Trump's second term as president began. A White House official said on Friday the \"Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace\".Machado said she was \"very glad\" to speak to the US president and was \"able to convey to him our appreciation\".The 58-year-old, forced to live in hiding for much of the past year, was hailed by the Nobel Committee as \"one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times\".Nobel chairman JÃ¸rgen Watne Frydnes said she was recognised for \"her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy\".He added: \"Despite serious threats against her life, she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions.\"Machado was barred from running in last year's presidential elections, in which Maduro won a third six-year term in office.The elections were widely dismissed on the international stage as neither free nor fair, and sparked protests across the country.Even after she was barred from the polls, she managed to unite the notoriously divided opposition faction and succeeded in getting millions of Venezuelans behind the little-known candidate which replaced her on the ballot, Edmundo GonzÃ¡lez.When the government-controlled National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner - even though tallies from polling stations showed that GonzÃ¡lez had won by a landslide - Machado continued to campaign from hiding as the Maduro government has repeatedly threatened her with arrest.Machado told BBC Mundo her award was \"like an injection\" for her political movement.\"It infuses energy, hope, strength on the Venezuelan people because we realise that we are not alone,\" she added. \"The democrats around the world share our struggle.\"She said she thought Trump and the international community were already helping with the political situation in Venezuela.\"The regime in Venezuela is a criminal structure,\" Machado told the BBC. \"And as such, it sustains themselves on the criminal flows from their illicit activities.\"We need the international community to cut those flows that are not only used for corruption, but also for repression, violence and terror.\"So when you cut the inflows that come from drug trafficking, gold smuggling, arms smuggling, human trafficking, or the black market of oil, then the regime falls.\"And that's exactly what we're seeing, cracks that are getting deeper and deeper as we talk right now.\"Earlier this month, US forces killed four people in an attack on a boat off the coast of Venezuela that was allegedly trafficking drugs.It was the latest in a number of recent strikes by the US on boats in international waters it said were involved in \"narco-trafficking\".They have attracted condemnation in countries including Venezuela and Colombia, with some international lawyers describing the strikes as a breach of international law.On Thursday Colombian President Gustavo Petro said one of the boats was \"Colombian with Colombian citizens inside\", an allegation the White House called \"baseless\".",

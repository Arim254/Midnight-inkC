    "body": "9 hours agoJaroslav LukivNurPhoto via Getty ImagesThorbjørn Jagland's lawyer promised his client's full co-operation with the investigationPolice in Norway have opened a corruption investigation into the country's former Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland over his alleged links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. A special Norwegian police unit which is analysing newly released Epstein files in the US said the 75-year-old was suspected of \"aggravated corruption\". Police said they had already asked the country's foreign ministry to lift his immunity, which he enjoys because of his past role as a senior foreign diplomat. Jagland is also a former head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee and spent 10 years as secretary general of the Council of Europe. His lawyer said they would fully co-operate with the investigation.Pål K. Lønseth, head of Økokrim - the economic crime unit investigating Jagland - said: \"We consider there are reasonable grounds for investigation, given that he held the positions of chair of the Nobel Committee and Secretary General of the Council of Europe during the period covered by the released documents.\"Among other things, Økokrim will investigate whether gifts, travel and loans were received in connection with his position.\"The police added that further details would be given \"at a later stage\".Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said it was \"important that the facts of this case are brought to light\".He added that Oslo would ask the Council of Europe for Jagland's immunity to be revoked.Jagland's lawyer Anders Brosveet welcomed the opening of the investigation.\"Based on what we have found so far, we are confident of the outcome,\" he told Reuters news agency. Separately, Brosveet told Norway's VG news site that he and his client would submit \"the key findings and documentation we have to Økokrim as soon as practically possible\".Jagland was Norway's prime minister in 1996-97, and the secretary general of the Council of Europe in 2009-19.He also chaired the Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2009-15.",

    "body": "5 hours agoScott DuffieldGetty ImagesThree African countries have agreed to take back foreign offenders and illegal migrants after the UK Home Secretary threatened them with visa penalties.A month after the threat from Shabana Mahmood, Namibia and Angola agreed to cooperate on returns. The Home Secretary has now also secured cooperation from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\"My message is clear, if foreign governments refuse to accept the return of their citizens, then they will face consequences,\" she said following the agreement.The UK government had previously warned it would stop granting visas to people from Angola, Namibia and the DRC if their governments did not improve co-operation on removals.The Home Office had said that returns from the DRC, Angola and Namibia were being frustrated - with paperwork not being processed or people being required to sign their own documents - giving them an effective veto. It had warned that the three countries faced penalties for their \"unacceptably poor and obstructive returns processes\".While setting out changes to the UK's asylum system in November, Mahmood warned visa penalties would be applied to countries that failed to co-operate with returns policies. Penalties included an \"emergency brake\" on visas for countries with high asylum claims until they take back citizens in the UK illegally.Following the agreement with the three countries, Mahmood said: \"Illegal migrants and dangerous criminals will now be removed and deported back to Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\"\"I will do what it takes to secure our order and control to our borders,\" she added.The government says over 3,000 people from these three countries could be eligible to be removed or deported due to the cooperation.The Home Secretary has indicated that ​countries which refuse to work with the UK on returns cannot expect a normal visa relationship, with further threats expected for lack of cooperation.It is understood that India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Somalia and Gabon are all resistant to returns deals and it is possible that the government could look at sanctions for those countries.",

    "body": "15 hours agoJoel GunterJerusalemNurPhoto via Getty ImagesA Palestinian man sells cigarettes in central Gaza (file photo)Israeli prosecutors have charged the brother of the head of the country's intelligence agency, Shin Bet, with \"aiding the enemy in wartime\" by allegedly smuggling cigarettes into Gaza.An indictment against Bezalel Zini published on Thursday argues he was aware that Hamas might profit from the resale of cigarettes and tobacco at inflated prices.Zini, 50, a reservist on active duty in the Israeli military, is said to have smuggled 14 cartons of cigarettes - 7,000 individual packets - in exchange for a total of 365,000 shekels ($117,000; £86,000).His brother, the recently appointed Shin Bet chief David Zini, is not suspected of any wrongdoing.Israel has tightly controlled the flow of humanitarian aid and other goods into Gaza during the conflict with Hamas.The charges are part of a wider set of indictments against more than a dozen individuals, alleging that an organised crime ring smuggled brand new, top-end iPhones, car parts, and other electronics into Gaza.The sale of smuggled tobacco and cigarettes alone put \"hundreds of millions of shekels into Hamas's coffers since the start of the war\", the indictment alleges.Prosecutors say the smuggling operation began in the summer of 2025, before the ceasefire in October, when the fighting was still raging in the strip.They say the smugglers pretended they were entering Gaza as part of their military duties, misleading Israeli soldiers on the border crossing points.The indictment against Bezalel Zini also accuses him of fraud, receiving a bribe, and tax offences. He was arrested two weeks ago along with two alleged accomplices, who were also charged with smuggling.Zini's defence lawyers said their client denied the charges, according to Israel's Haaretz newspaper, arguing that the application of a terrorism law was not appropriate for the alleged smuggling of cigarettes.\"Regarding the offence of aiding the enemy during wartime, it is a complete inversion of reality. This is someone who has given everything and risked his life for the state,\" the paper quoted one of his lawyers as saying.",

    "body": "The World Anti-Doping Agency could investigate if evidence emerges that male ski jumpers are injecting their penises in a bid to improve sporting performance.In January, German newspaper Bild, external reported that jumpers were injecting their penises with hyaluronic acid before being measured for their suits.Hyaluronic acid, which is not banned in sport, can be used to increase penis circumference by one or two centimetres.This would increase the surface area of their suits during competition, which, according to FIS, the international ski and snowboard federation, could increase their flight in the air.\"Every extra centimetre on a suit counts. If your suit has a 5% bigger surface area, you fly further,\" said FIS ski jumping men's race director Sandro Pertile.Asked about the claims in Bild at a press conference at the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics, Wada director general Olivier Niggli said: \"I am not aware of the details of ski jumping, and how that could improve performance. \"If anything was to come to the surface, we would look at it and see if it is doping related. We don't address other [non-doping] means of enhancing performance.\"Clearly entertained by the question, Wada's Polish president Witold Banka joked: \"Ski jumping is very popular in Poland so I promise you I'm going to look at it.\"FIS communications director Bruno Sassi told BBC Sport: \"There has never been any indication, let alone evidence, that any competitor has ever made use of a hyaluronic acid injection to attempt to gain a competitive advantage.\"Before the start of each season, ski jumpers are measured using 3D body scanners, in which they must wear only \"elastic, body-tight underwear\". Rules state their suits must have a tolerance of only 2-4cm, and as part of the measuring process, their crotch height is also measured.The crotch height of their suit must conform to the athlete's crotch height, with the addition of 3cm for men.Hyularonic acid injected into the penis can last up to 18 months.There have been previous attempts to improve performance through manipulations of the suits.In August, Norwegian Olympic medallists Marius Lindvik and Johann Andre Forfang accepted three-month suspensions for their part in the tampering of suits during the men's large hill event at the World Ski Championships in Trondheim, Norway, in March.While it later transpired the athletes themselves were not aware of the tampering, FIS said their team had \"tried to cheat the system\" by putting reinforced thread in their jumpsuits.Both athletes are set to compete at these Winter Olympics, which officially start on Friday.The men's ski jumping competition begins on Monday.",

    "body": "16 hours agoSamantha GranvilleBeirutReutersThe Israeli military declined to comment on the allegationsLebanon has accused Israeli aircraft of spraying an agricultural herbicide over southern villages at concentrations authorities described as dangerously high, raising concerns for food and environmental security.The agriculture and environment ministries said laboratory tests confirmed the substance was glyphosate, a chemical used to destroy vegetation, with concentrations in some samples \"between 20 and 30 times the levels usually accepted\".President Joseph Aoun condemned the spraying of what he described as \"toxic substances\", calling it a violation of Lebanese sovereignty and an environmental and health crime.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC they had no comment on the matter.The purpose behind the release of herbicide on the villages remains unclear.Residents in several border villages reported the spraying, which comes more than a year after a ceasefire ended a war between Israel and the Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah.Earlier in the week, United Nations peacekeepers in Lebanon said they had been notified by Israel of planned spraying near the border and were advised to take shelter.The communication forced them to cancel some of their planned operations. They said this was not the first time Israeli forces had dropped unknown chemical substances from aircraft over Lebanese territory.With tens of thousands still displaced after hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah in 2023-24, the challenges for returning home are compounded, according to Ramzi Kaiss, a researcher with Human Rights Watch in Lebanon.\"These areas are heavily dependent on agriculture - olive groves, tobacco, and other crops - and this incident complicates people's ability to return to their homes, maintain their livelihoods, and rebuild after extensive destruction,\" Kaiss said.Experts warn that incidents like this do not only harm local ecosystems but also have broader economic consequences for Lebanon's farming sector.In April 2025, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization reported that the 2024 conflict had caused more than $700m (£515m; 600m euros ) in damage and losses to Lebanon's agricultural sector, particularly in the south and the Bekaa Valley.Environmental groups like Green Southerners in Lebanon also expressed concern about the impact on agricultural production and soil fertility.\"These actions threaten ecosystems already damaged by white phosphorus, with serious risks to insect communities and natural pollinators, undermining biodiversity, food security, and local livelihoods,\" the group said in an Instagram post.But there's no universal consensus on the risks of glyphosate.The World Health Organization's (WHO) International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies it as \"probably carcinogenic to humans,\" citing a link to non-Hodgkin lymphoma, while other regulatory bodies, including the US Environmental Protection Agency and European Food Safety Authority, have concluded it is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans.The Lebanese foreign ministry said it intended to submit a formal complaint against Israel to the UN Security Council.",

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the talks had not been easy and he wanted \"faster results\".EPA/ShutterstockThe exchanged Russian soldiers were currently staying in Belarus, the Russian defence ministry saidRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.In a post on social media, Zelensky wrote that Thursday's prisoner exchange \"took place after a long pause\" - referring to the previous such swap last October.\"We are returning our people home - 157 Ukrainians. Soldiers of the Armed Forces, National Guard, State Border Service. And civilians are also returning with the defenders,\" the Ukrainian president said, pledging to bring back every single Ukrainian still in Russian captivity.  Ukrainians officials said 139 had been in Russian captivity since 2022.Meanwhile, the Russian defence ministry said 157 of its POWs were returned by Kyiv.The ministry added that three Russian civilians \"illegally held\" were also handed back. They were residents of the western Kursk region, parts of which were occupied by Ukraine during its incursion in 2024-25.The talks in Abu Dhabi - the second round in recent weeks - are part of US President Donald Trump's efforts to end the war. Special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner have been leading the negotiations. The talks had been \"detailed and productive\", Witkoff wrote on X, but added that \"significant work remains\".The most difficult issue is territory, with Russia demanding that Ukraine cedes the rest of the eastern industrial region of Donbas that Moscow does not currently control.Another key sticking point is believed to be Kyiv's demand to get robust security guarantees from its European allies and the US. No details have been released.  The trilateral talks began as Russia renewed its deadly attacks on Ukraine after a week-long pause that Trump had asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to observe as a fierce cold swept Ukraine.",

    "body": "5 hours agoKelly NgandShaimaa Khalil,Tokyo correspondentReutersTakaichi has \"already proven to be a strong, powerful, and wise leader,\" Trump says in throwing his weight behind herDonald Trump has endorsed Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi ahead of a snap election in her country on Sunday. Takaichi has \"already proven to be a strong, powerful, and wise leader... one that truly loves her country,\" the US president wrote in a Truth Social post on Thursday, adding: \"She will not let the people of Japan down!\"While it is rare for US presidents to publicly back candidates in foreign elections, Trump has done so before, endorsing Argentina's Javier Milei and Hungary's Viktor Orban most recently.  Takaichi has courted the US president as Tokyo seeks more stability in its relationship with Washington, its closest ally, in the wake of Trump's tariffs. Trump had threatened a 25% tariff initially, but Japan then struck a deal in July  to invest $550bn (£407bn) in the US. In exchange, Washington lowered import levies to 15%. Takaichi, 64, became PM in October after she won the leadership race in her party and secured enough support in parliament. But she called for an last month election to seek a public mandate. Just one week after she took office, Tokyo rolled out the red carpet for Trump, deploying a full military guard of honour and band to welcome him at the Akasaka Palace, the government's state guesthouse.It was her diplomatic debut, and the optics were striking: Takaichi aboard the aircraft carrier USS George Washington, fists pumping as the US president praised her in front of thousands of US soldiers, the images then broadcast around the world.She sought to portray herself as a leader Trump can and wants to do business with and, perhaps more importantly for the president, someone he gets along with personally.The two leaders also see eye-to-eye on defence. Trump wants Tokyo to spend more on its own security and so does Takaichi, as sentiment grows in Japan that it must invest more in defence. They heaped compliments on each other during the visit and signed a deal on rare earths, as well as a document heralding a new \"golden age\" of US-Japan relations. Takaichi described Trump as a \"partner in a new golden era\", and praised his role in bringing peace to the Middle East. \"In my visit to Japan, I and all of my representatives, were extremely impressed with her,\" Trump wrote in his Truth Social post on Thursday, noting that the two countries have made progress in national security cooperation and on the economic front.Trump also said he will welcome Takaichi to the White House on 19 March. Getty Images'My goal is to become the Iron Lady,' Takaichi saysHis post, which signals that Takaichi is a leader his administration would work with, is a message aimed not only at Japanese voters but also the region, and especially China. Beijing and Tokyo are in the middle of  a diplomatic rift, and the historically tense relationship has hit its lowest point in more than a decade.Takaichi found herself the target of China's ire in November, when she made comments suggesting that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan, the self-governed island it has long claimed. She has since refused to retract the statement.Trump's endorsement of her comes as tensions between them continue, and a day after he had a phone call with China's leader Xi Jinping. Xi called Taiwan \"the most important issue\" in their relationship, emphasising that Taiwan was \"China's territory\", Chinese state media reported. He also told Trump that Washington should be \"prudent\" when supplying weapons to the self-governed island which China has long claimed.Polls so far are predicting a landslide for Takaichi but winning Sunday's election will just be the first of several hurdles. Her leadership will be defined by how she manages Japan's stagnant economy and the delicate relationship with the US, its most critical security ally, as well as China, its largest trading partner.",

    "body": "19 hours agoMalu CursinoGetty ImagesJapanese authorities in a town near Mount Fuji have cancelled this year's cherry blossom festival, saying a surge in tourist numbers is unmanageable for locals.The influx of tourists to the town of Fujiyoshida has led to chronic traffic congestion and litter, while some residents say they've experienced tourists trespassing or defecating in private gardens.The area is a popular destination during spring because Japan's world-renowned cherry trees are in full bloom, and can be admired with Mount Fuji in the background.But Fujiyoshida's picturesque scenery threatens \"the quiet lives of citizens,\" the city's mayor explained, adding: \"We have a strong sense of crisis.\"\"To protect the dignity and living environment of our citizens, we have decided to bring the curtain down on the 10-year-old festival,\" Fujiyoshida mayor Shigeru Horiuchi said when making the announcement on Tuesday.In April 2016, authorities announced they would be opening the gates of Arakurayama Sengen Park to host tourists during the sakura (cherry blossom) season. The park offers a panoramic view of the city from its pagoda, with several picture-worthy and \"Instagrammable\" spots. Fujiyoshida authorities began hosting the annual event at Arakurayama Sengen Park with the hope to enhance the area's appeal and increase the numbers of visitors by creating \"a lively atmosphere in the area\".However, authorities say the number of visitors in recent years has \"increased dramatically, exceeding the city's capacity and resulting in overtourism, which is having a serious impact on the living environment of local residents\".Now, as many as 10,000 visitors flock to the town daily during the peak blossom season, Fujiyoshida authorities add in a statement.This increase is \"due to factors such as the weak yen and explosive popularity fueled by social media\". The town's authorities report that tourists were \"opening private home doors without permission to use the restroom,\" trespassing, littering and \"defecating in private yards and raising a fuss when residents pointed this out\".Although the festival will not go ahead, the city is preparing for an increased number of visitors during April and May.Getty ImagesIt is not the first time Japanese authorities have had to take measures to address photo-keen tourists.In 2024, officials blocked one of Japan's most iconic photo spots in Fujikawaguchiko with a big black barrier in a bid to deter badly behaved tourists.Residents of Fujikawaguchiko had accused foreign tourists of littering and parking illegally as they searched for the perfect picture.Getty ImagesThe famous shot in Fujikawaguchiko features a convenience store in the foreground, with Japan's most famous landmark rising behind itJapan is not alone in its efforts to deter overcrowding caused by tourists.On Monday, Italian authorities introduced a €2 fee to access the viewing area of Rome's iconic Trevi Fountain, which had previously been free to visit. Authorities say the fee will go towards helping to manage the number of tourists, and raise funds for the monument's upkeep.In Venice, day trippers hoping to visit the Italian city on certain days between April and July will have to pay €5 if they book in advance, or €10 if they book last-minute.",

    "body": "42 minutes agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporterGetty ImagesPrior to the opening of the Canadian consulate, only Iceland and the United States had a full diplomatic presence in Greenland. Canada is set to open its first diplomatic outpost in Greenland in a significant show of solidarity following US President Donald Trump's threats to take control of the territory. A delegation of senior Canadian officials, including Governor General Mary Simon, and foreign minister Anita Anand, are travelling to Nuuk on Friday to formally open Canada's consulate, accompanied by a Canadian Coast Guard ship.Ahead of the trip, Simon said in a speech that Canada \"stands firmly in support of the people of Greenland who will determine their own future\".Their visit comes amid a similar trip made by French officials, who are due to open their own consulate in the territory the same day.The Canadian and French missions are a historic expansion of foreign engagement in Greenland. Until this week, only Iceland and the US had formal diplomatic consulates in Nuuk.It is also a signal of the continued support offered by Nato allies to Greenland, after Trump repeatedly stated that the US needs to \"own\" it for national security reasons. The president has since walked his comments back, saying he is now exploring a potential deal after talks with Denmark, European allies and Canada.Greenland has been on Canada's radar for some time. The consulate was first announced in early 2024, when Ottawa reviewed its Arctic foreign policy. The opening had been slated for late 2025, but that was delayed due to bad weather.Getty ImagesGovernor General Mary Simon (right) is part of the delegation travelling to Nuuk. She is Canada's Crown representative and head of state.Now, the consulate carries even more weight, said Michael Myers, a professor at the University of British Columbia who has authored several books on the Arctic.\"I'm only surprised it hasn't occurred sooner, given the important connections between Greenland and Arctic Canada,\" he added.He noted that Iqaluit, the capital of Canada's northern territory of Nunavut, is only an hour flight away from Nuuk. Inuit in Canada also share a strong bond with Greenlandic Inuit – a bond underscored by Governor General Simon's own Inuk roots.\"Her visit is an affirmation at the highest level of the cultural and ethnic connections between Arctic Canada and Greenland,\" Myers said. \"It's a very powerful statement.\"Simon, who grew up in Nunavik in northern Quebec, is the first Canadian governor general to visit Greenland since 1982. But her exposure to the Arctic territory began decades ago, she said, when she would hear Greenlandic Inuit songs as a child through her grandmother's shortwave radio.\"She would say: 'These are our relatives who live in faraway lands. We are all one people,'\" Simon recalled at the annual Arctic Frontiers conference this week in Norway, shortly before her trip to Nuuk.Natan Obed, president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, which represents Canadian Inuit, told the BBC that the consulate is the result of years of advocacy by his community to forge closer ties.Obed said that around 50 Canadian Inuit will be arriving on a chartered plane from Montreal to Nuuk to attend Friday's ceremony.Inuit in Canada, he said, feel the US threats against Greenland intimately due to their shared history of colonisation, as well as Trump's own comments about Canada.\"We do worry that the United States may return to its more serious overtures around annexing Canada and Canada being the 51st state, and we do worry that Inuit Nunangat, our homeland, is one of the pivotal reasons for the US to consider that sentiment,\" Obed said.Getty ImagesGreenlanders have strongly opposed Donald Trump's proposal of seizing the semi-autonomous Arctic island, as have other Nato allies like France and Canada.Trump has justified a US takeover of Greenland by blaming Denmark for failing to adequately protect the island from Russian or Chinese threats. The Arctic has been flagged as a vulnerability by successive Canadian governments, and Obed acknowledged that infrastructure there, like highways and electricity connections, remains limited, to the detriment of both national security and those who call the northern regions home.Prime Minister Mark Carney's government has promised a year-round military presence in the Arctic and pledged more than C$1bn ($730m; £540m) for northern infrastructure projects that would be used by both civilians and the military.Foreign minister Anand has called Arctic defence \"an unquestionable national security priority of this government\".\"It is not a secondary concern, it is not a regional issue, but central to how we protect Canada in our front yard and how we contribute to global security,\" she said at a Nordic-Canadian Arctic Symposium last week.Along with the opening of the Canadian consulate, Governor General Simon will also be meeting with Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, while Anand will meet with her counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt.",

    "body": "Growing calls in India to restrict children's social media use1 day agoAbhishek DeyGuwahatiGetty ImagesExperts say that a social media ban would not be easy in India and could face legal challengesA debate around banning social media for children under 16 is gathering momentum in India, with ministers in several states saying they are studying a law that recently came into effect in Australia.Ministers in at least two southern states have said recently that they are checking if a ban would be effective in keeping children away from social media. And last week, the Economic Survey - an annual document written by a team led by India's chief economic adviser - recommended that the federal government consider age-based limits for social media use by children. The survey's recommendations are not binding on the government but can inform policy decisions.Experts, however, warn that such a ban would not be easy in India and could face legal challenges.Australia recently became the first country in the world to ban most social media platforms for children under 16, making it mandatory for platforms to verify users' ages and disable accounts by underage users.The move sparked criticism from social media platforms which, Australia's internet regulator told the BBC last month, came to the regime \"kicking and screaming - very very reluctantly\". Last week, lawmakers in France's lower house approved a bill that would ban social media access for under-15s. It still needs to be passed by the Senate.The UK is also considering a ban.In India, LSK Devarayalu, a lawmaker from the regional Telugu Desam Party - which governs Andhra Pradesh state and is a key part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's federal coalition - proposed a bill last week seeking to bar children under 16 from using social media.As a private member's bill, the proposal does not reflect government policy and is unlikely to become law - but it could shape parliamentary debates.Separately, the Andhra Pradesh government has set up a group of ministers to study global regulatory frameworks and invited major platforms, including Meta, X, Google and ShareChat, for consultations. The companies haven't commented on the invitation yet.The state's Information Technology Minister Nara Lokesh last week said on X that children were \"slipping into relentless usage\" of social media, affecting their attention spans and education.\"We will ensure social media becomes a safer space and reduce its damaging impact - especially for women and children,\" he added.Other states have expressed interest in similar measures.Goa's Tourism and IT Minister Rohan Khaunte said the state was examining whether a ban could be implemented, adding that more details would follow.Priyank Kharge, the IT minister of Karnataka - home to Bengaluru city which is known as India's Silicon Valley - told the state assembly that the government was discussing responsible use of artificial intelligence and social media, and referred to a \"digital detox\" programme involving around 300,000 students and 100,000 teachers that the government launched in partnership with Meta.Kharge, however, did not specify whether legislation was being considered or which age groups might be affected.AFP via Getty ImagesAustralia is the first country in the world to ban most social media platforms for children under 16But enforcing state-level bans would be complicated, says digital rights activist Nikhil Pahwa. \"While companies can infer users' locations through IP addresses, such systems are often inaccurate. Where state boundaries are very close, you can end up creating conflicts if one state bans social media use and another does not.\"He also points to difficulties around age verification, saying the issue was not unique to India. \"Age verification is not simple. To adhere to such bans, companies would effectively have to verify every individual using every service on the internet,\" Pahwa told the BBC.Even in Australia, some children have told the BBC that they get around the ban by using fake birthdays to create new accounts.According to Prateek Waghre, a public policy expert and head of programmes at the Tech Global Institute, enforcement would also depend on the cooperation of platforms and intermediaries. \"In theory, location can be inferred through IP addresses by internet service providers or technology companies, but whether the companies operating such apps would comply, or challenge such directions in court, is not yet clear,\" he says.While lawmakers have identified a genuine problem, a ban seems to be an overly narrow response, experts think. A recent study by a non-profit organisation that surveyed 1,277 Indian teenagers suggests that age-based restrictions and verification systems may face additional hurdles in India's digital landscape. Many accounts, it says, are created with help from family members or friends and are not linked to personal email addresses, complicating assumptions of individual ownership that underpin age-verification systems.While some parents in India have welcomed the idea of a ban online, others point out a deeper issue.\"Parents themselves fail to give enough time to children and hand them phones to keep them engaged - the problem starts there,\" says Delhi resident Jitender Yadav, who has two daughters aged eight and four. \"I am not sure if a social media ban will help. Because unless parents give enough time to their children or learn to keep them creatively engaged, they will always find ways to bypass such bans,\" he says.",

    "body": "A global craze for Korean culture is making its humblest snacks unaffordable1 day agoYuna Ku,SeoulandSuhnwook Lee,SeoulGetty ImagesSouth Korea is known to be the world's largest producer and exporter of dried gimBlack, crispy, often flat and square - dried seaweed, known locally as gim - is a humble staple on everyday dining tables across South Korea. But as its global popularity grows, its rising prices are worrying gim-lovers nationwide.Lee Hyang-ran has been selling gim for the past 47 years. \"In the past, people from Western countries thought Koreans were eating something weird that looks like a piece of black paper,\" the vendor, who is in her 60s, says from a small market stall in central Seoul.\"I never thought I'd be selling gim to them. But now, they all come here and buy it.\"South Korea is known to be the world's largest producer and exporter of gim, supplying markets across Asia, North America and Europe. Some even refer to the product as Korea's \"black semiconductor\", a reference to South Korea's large share of the global semiconductor industry. Exports have risen steadily in recent years - and in 2025, South Korea's dried seaweed exports hit a record $1.13bn, according to the Korea Maritime Institute (KMI).And as demand rises, so do prices.Known locally as an affordable snack or ingredient, gim typically cost around 100 won ($0.06; £0.05) per sheet in 2024 - with the snack usually sold in bundles of 10 sheets or more, or around $0.60 per pack.  But last month, the price of one sheet of gim rose to above 150 won - a record high in the country. \"Premium products now cost as much as 350 won per sheet,\" said Lee. BBC/Suhnwook LeeLee Hyang-ran has been selling gim for 47 years Kim Jaela, who's in her 30s, typically buys gim in bulk - about 500 small sheets at a time, enough to last her several months. But she says this may need to change, considering how expensive gim has become. She does most of her grocery shopping online, and was checking prices on her phone during the interview.\"Oh my, it really did get more expensive by a few dollars! Luckily, I can survive a few more weeks with two packs of gim, but if I see the same or higher price later, I probably won't restock,\" she said.A humble Korean staple The worldwide appetite for gim reflects a growing global demand in Korean goods, driven by cultural influences like K-pop and K-dramas. As global audiences engage more deeply with such entertainment, they're also increasing looking to Korean cuisine, something businesses worldwide have picked up on. In 2023, US supermarket chain Trader Joe's Gimbap - a Korean rice roll wrapped in seaweed - went viral and was cleared off the shelves nationwide shortly after its launch.\"I first learned about gim because it's a typical Korean food often seen in K-dramas,\" Miki, a 22-year-old visitor from Japan told the BBC. \"We do have similar thing called nori in Japan, but the taste is totally different. Gim is lighter and crispier, and is mostly grilled with sesame oil and salt, whereas nori is typically seasoned with soy sauce.\"Viola, a 60-year-old visitor from Brooklyn, New York, says she enjoys gim as a snack. \"I just pop it in my mouth like a potato chip,\" she said, adding that it feels like a \"healthier alternative\". \"From Asian to Western countries, more people are becoming familiar with gim, increasing global demand,\" said Lee Eunhee, a professor of consumer studies at Inha University. \"To meet overseas demand, domestic prices are being pushed up.\"Kim Namin, 29, runs a seasoned gim processing factory with a 30-year family history in Wando, an island in South Korea's southern waters known for abalone and seaweed production. His factory purchases raw seaweed, grills it with oil and salt, and cuts it into the familiar rectangular sheets sold in stores.Over the past five years, most of their products have been exported globally. \"There aren't enough gim factories compared to the rising demand,\" he said, saying that his family is now considering expanding operations.He adds that gim is a highly price-sensitive staple in South Korea, long associated with affordability. Even marginal increases in its cost are keenly felt by consumers and tend to provoke strong public resistance - another reason why he's  focusing more on overseas markets.Government officials and experts say the price increase is being driven by multiple factors, including overall inflation, rising labour costs, and a decline in overseas production. However, many agree that increased growing global demand remains a major driver.In an effort to appease domestic consumers, companies - alongside the government - are taking steps to curb rising costs.South Korea's Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries has pledged to closely monitor the situation to stabilise its price. and Korean food companies like Pulmone have plans to establish a land-based seaweed R&D centre, so they can be harvested throughout the year. Back in Seoul, the market buzzes with tourists, and business is booming for Lee. \"Gim has been selling like hot cakes... the ones for making gimbap are especially popular,\" she says. \"I'm glad Korean gim is getting popular.\"",

    "body": "8 hours agoAshay YedgeBBC MarathiDevesh Chopra/BBCThese women work with the local forest department to track and protect the snow leopard species In one of India's coldest and most remote regions, a group of women have taken on an unlikely role: protecting one of Asia's most elusive predators, the snow leopard.Snow leopards are found in just 12 countries across Central and South Asia. India is home to one of the world's largest populations, with a nationwide survey in 2023 - the first comprehensive count ever carried out in the country - estimating more than 700 animals, .One of the places they roam is around Kibber village in Himachal Pradesh state's Spiti Valley, a stark, high-altitude cold desert along the Himalayan belt. Here, snow leopards are often called the \"ghosts of the mountains\", slipping silently across rocky slopes and rarely revealing themselves.For generations, the animals were seen largely as a threat, for attacking livestock. But attitudes in Kibber and neighbouring villages are beginning to shift, as people increasingly recognise the snow leopard's role as a top predator in the food chain and its importance in maintaining the region's fragile mountain ecosystem.Nearly a dozen local women are now working alongside the Himachal Pradesh forest department and conservationists to track and protect the species, playing a growing role in conservation efforts.Locally, the snow leopard is known as Shen and the women call their group \"Shenmo\". Trained to install and monitor camera traps, they handle devices fitted with unique IDs and memory cards that automatically photograph snow leopards as they pass.\"Earlier, men used to go and install the cameras and we kept wondering why couldn't we do it too,\" says Lobzang Yangchen, a local coordinator working with a small group supported by the non-profit Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF) in collaboration with the forest department.Yangchen was among the women who helped collect data for Himachal Pradesh's snow leopard survey in 2024, which found that the state was home to 83 snow leopards - up from 51 in 2021.Spiti Wildlife DivisionSnow leopards are often called the \"ghosts of the mountains\" because they are so hard to spotThe survey documented snow leopards and 43 other species using camera traps spread across an area of nearly 26,000sq km (10,000sq miles). Individual leopards were identified by the unique rosette patterns on their fur, a standard technique used for spotted big cats. The findings are now feeding into wider conservation and habitat-management plans.\"Their contribution was critical to identifying individual animals,\" says Goldy Chhabra, deputy conservator of forests with the Spiti Wildlife Division.Collecting the data is demanding work. Most of it takes place in winter, when heavy snowfall pushes snow leopards and their prey to lower altitudes, making their routes easier to track.On survey days, the women wake up early, finish household chores and gather at a base camp before travelling by vehicle as far as the terrain allows. From there, they trek several kilometres to reach camera sites, often at altitudes above 14,000ft (4,300m), where the thin air makes even simple movement exhausting.The BBC accompanied the group on one such trek in December. After hours of walking in biting cold, the women suddenly stopped on a narrow trail.Yangchen points to pugmarks in the dust: \"This shows the snow leopard has been here recently. These pugmarks are fresh.\"Devesh Chopra/BBCThe women set up cameras with unique IDs and memory cards, which capture an image of a snow leopard as soon as it passes throughAlong with pugmarks, the team looks for other signs, including scrapes and scent‑marking spots, before carefully fixing a camera to a rock along the trail.One woman then carries out a \"walk test\", crawling along the path to check whether the camera's height and angle will capture a clear image.The group then moves on to older sites, retrieving memory cards and replacing batteries installed weeks earlier.By mid-afternoon, they return to camp to log and analyse the images using specialised software - tools many had never encountered before.\"I studied only until grade five,\" says Chhering Lanzom. \"At first, I was scared to use the computer. But slowly, we learned how to use the keyboard and mouse.\"The women joined the camera-trapping programme in 2023. Initially, conservation was not their motivation. But winters in the Spiti Valley are long and quiet, with little agricultural work to fall back on. \"At first, this work on snow leopards didn't interest us,\" Lobzang says. \"We joined because we were curious and we could earn a small income.\"The women earn between 500 ($5.46; £4) and 700 rupees a day. But beyond the money, the work has helped transform how the community views the animal.Spiti Wildlife DivisionImages captured by the camera traps are analysed using a special software\"Earlier, we thought the snow leopard was our enemy,\" says Dolma Zangmo, a local resident. \"Now we think their conservation is important.\"Alongside survey work, the women help villagers access government insurance schemes for their livestock and promote the use of predator‑proof corrals - stone or mesh enclosures that protect animals at night.Their efforts come at a time of growing recognition for the region. Spiti Valley has recently been included in the Cold Desert Biosphere Reserve, a Unesco-recognised network aimed at conserving fragile ecosystems while supporting local livelihoods.As climate change reshapes the fragile trans-Himalayan landscape, conservationists say such community participation will be crucial to safeguarding species like the snow leopard.\"Once communities are involved, conservation becomes more sustainable,\" says Deepshikha Sharma, programme manager with NCF's High Altitudes initiative.\"These women are not just assisting, they are becoming practitioners of wildlife conservation and monitoring,\" she adds.As for the women, their work makes them feel closer to their home, the village and the mountains that raised them, they say. \"We were born here, this is all we know,\" Lobzang says. \"Sometimes we feel afraid because these snow leopards are after all predatory animals, but this is where we belong.\"",

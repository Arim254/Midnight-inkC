    "body": "6 hours agoAleks PhillipsandNikos PapanikolaouGetty ImagesThessaloniki Airport closed entirely after air traffic communication was knock outThousands of passengers are stranded across Europe after a communications failure forced Greece to close its airspace, causing widespread cancellations and delays.Officials are working to understand why radio communications were disrupted on Sunday morning, prompting the temporary suspension of arrivals and departures.Some departures have since been allowed to resume - though inbound flights are still being told to divert or return to their point of origin. Athens' main airport is among the worst affected, while Thessaloniki airport has closed entirely.The timing of the disruption has raised fears that travellers will not be able to get home before the start of the working week.\"I was supposed to fly to London, via Stockholm, with SAS,\" one passenger at Athens International Airport told Greek broadcaster Mega TV. \"I'm working on Newport Hospital tomorrow morning. I'm not going to be there on time, I don't know what else to say. \"Who is going to pay for the additional cost this travel will cost me? We still don't know if and when we're going to leave, no one is telling us anything.\"More than 90 flights have been affected in and out of Athens airport alone - though some flights have since been able to resume.A member of staff in the airport told the BBC that 35 aircraft an hour were now being allowed to take off, but it was still unable to take inbound flights.Flights departing from Dublin, Barcelona and Paris were earlier ordered to return to their airports of origin, while services from Copenhagen and Malta were cancelled altogether. Other arrivals into Athens were placed on standby, while flights in and out of other Greek airports have also been affected. Three flights out of Heraklion airport on the island of Crete, including one to Munich, have been delayed, according to public broadcaster ERT.Most inbound flights are being diverted to Turkey if not cancelled outright, it reports.Reuters / Flightradar24Greek airspace was nearly empty earlier on Sunday due to the technical faultThe disruption comes at a busy time for air travel in and out of Athens, which typically sees more than 600 scheduled flights per day, as people return from winter holidays.In the chaos, some passengers have complained of a lack of information. One told news site Flash: \"We have no updates. They told us that we will be able to leave but I don't think this is true. On the departures board I can't see my flight, and I'm supposed to leave shortly.\"Another, who had been on a flight to Rhodes when it turned around and headed back to Athens, told news agency Reuters: \"From that moment until now we have no information whatsoever.\"Domestic travellers may have the option of getting home on Greece's rail network, but this would take significantly longer.The issue that caused the disruption is thought to concern the radio system used by air traffic controllers to communicate with planes in their airspace.Panagiotis Psarros, chair of the Association of Greek Air Traffic Controllers, told ERT that all frequencies were \"suddenly lost\", adding: \"We could not communicate with aircraft in the sky.\"The broadcaster later reported than an initial investigation by the Greek security services suggested the problem may be due to the failure of an antenna in the Gerania Mountains near Athens. Italy, Turkey and Cyprus are assisting Greece in managing the situation.",

It is illegal to pay ransom money to the criminal groups, which the government has classified as terrorists, but there are claims this is often ignored.Zakari KontagoraThe attack on Kasuwan-Daji is the latest is a spike of violent attacks against villages in Niger stateA witness to the attack told BBC Hausa that there were no security forces in the village. \"We want the government to help us. In the past, we used to hear about this problem in other places, but now it is happening in our villages,\" he said.The fear is driving people from their homes where they were born and raised.\"We are dying like chickens, and does the government care about us? \"The government hears and sees what is happening, but it is not doing anything about it. What can we do as ordinary people?\"Zakari KontagoraVillagers say the attacks are driving people away from the villages they grew up in",

    "body": "13 minutes agoTom McArthurGetty ImagesA national day of mourning has been announced in Switzerland for 9 JanuaryThe bodies of the 40 victims of a bar fire in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana have been identified by police.The victims range in age from 14 to 39 years old, with 15 aged under 18. The youngest were a Swiss girl and a French boy, both 14.The group includes people of Swiss, Italian, Romanian, Turkish, Portuguese, French, and Belgian nationalities, as well as a citizen of the UK, France and Israel.Among them is 16-year-old Swiss national Arthur Brodard, his mother said.A criminal investigation into the people who ran Le Constellation bar is under way, while victim's families are enduring an agonising wait for information about loved ones who are still considered missing.Police said no further details will be released about the victims they had identified out of respect for their relatives.However, Arthur Brodard's mother took to Facebook on Saturday night to announce that he \"has left to party in paradise\".\"We can start our mourning, knowing that he is in peace and in the light,\" she said as she appeared visibly upset in a video message.While Arthur was still presumed missing and information on his whereabouts was scarce, Ms Brodard-Sitre told local newspaper Le Temps that she had been \"living a nightmare\".Some of his friends had been found with burns covering nearly half their bodies, she told the newspaper. \"There are no words - they went through hell.\"Laetitia Brodard-Sitre/FacebookArthur Brodard's mother posted a moving tribute to her sonSparklers on bottles being carried too close to the ceiling are the likely cause of the fire during New Year's celebrations at the bar, a preliminary investigation has found. The devastating fire killed at least 40 people and injured 119 others. Many of the dead and missing are teenagers. Le Constellation was a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16.SUPPLIEDVideo from inside the bar appears to show the moment the ceiling covering caught fireOn Saturday, the Italian ambassador to to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado, said the identification process was slow because of the severity of the burns many victims had suffered.The French couple who own the bar - named by the media as Jacques and Jessica Moretti - are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office for the Valais region said.Beatrice Pilloud, Valais canton lead prosecutor, said in a statement that investigators were looking into whether the acoustic foam on the venue's ceiling was \"the cause of the problem\", as well as \"whether it complies with regulations\".Italian media named junior golfer Emanuele Galeppini, 16, as the first identified victim of the fire following a statement from the Italian Golf Federation paying tribute to the \"young athlete who carried with him passion and authentic values\".His father is quoted as saying his son was at Le Constellation. A spokesperson for the Italian foreign ministry previously told the BBC it would not confirm the death.",

    "body": "2 hours agoReutersDenmark has urged the US to respect its \"territorial integrity\", after the wife of one of Donald Trump's top aides tweeted a map of Greenland in the colours of the American flag.Katie Miller, who is married to the US president's deputy chief of staff, posted the altered image of the Danish autonomous territory on her X feed late on Saturday, alongside the word \"SOON\".Danish ambassador to the US, Jesper Moeller Soerensen, reposted her message, with a \"friendly reminder\" of the close defence ties between the countries. Trump has repeatedly raised the possibility of Greenland becoming an annexed part of the US, citing its strategic location and mineral wealth.His government's move to appoint a special envoy to Greenland recently prompted anger in Denmark - a Nato ally that has traditionally enjoyed close relations with Washington.Responding to the post by Ms Miller - a right-wing podcaster and former aide to Trump during his first term - Mr Soerensen said: \"Just a friendly reminder about the US and the Kingdom of Denmark: We are close allies and should continue to work together as such.\"US security is also Greenland's and Denmark's security. Greenland is already part of NATO. The Kingdom of Denmark and the United States work together to ensure security in the Arctic.\"Mr Soerensen pointed out that Denmark had significantly increased its defence spending in 2025, committing $13.7bn (£10.2bn) \"that can be used in the Arctic and North Atlantic. Because we take our joint security seriously\".He added: \"And yes, we expect full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark.\"The exchange comes after the US carried out a major military operation against Venezuela on Saturday, capturing its president Nicolas Maduro and his wife and removing them to New York.Trump later said the US would \"run\" Venezuela and US oil companies would \"start making money for the country\".The US president has previously refused to rule out using force to secure control of Greenland, a vast island in the Arctic. Trump has claimed that making it part of the United States would serve US security interests due to its strategic location and its abundance of minerals critical to high-tech sectors. Greenland, which has a population of 57,000 people, has had extensive self-government since 1979, though defence and foreign policy remain in Danish hands. While most Greenlanders favour eventual independence from Denmark, opinion polls show overwhelming opposition to becoming part of the US.More on this story",

    "body": "Donald Trump's warning that the US will intervene if peaceful protesters are killed was \"reckless and dangerous\", Iran's foreign minister has said.Abbas Araghchi's comments came after the US president said Washington \"will come to their rescue\" in reference to demonstrators taking part in protests over Iran's economy, writing in a brief social media post: \"We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"Araghchi indicated Iran's armed forces were on standby and \"know exactly where to aim\" in the event of an attack.At least eight people are reported to have died during the week-long protests, as of Saturday morning.Trump wrote on Friday: \"If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"The US president did not specify what action Washington might take. Previously, it has carried out strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, which elicited a retaliatory strike on a US base in Qatar.\"Given President Trump's deployment of the National Guard within US borders, he of all people should know that criminal attacks on public property cannot be tolerated,\" Araghchi wrote on X.Iran would \"forcefully reject any interference in their internal affairs\", he added.On Saturday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei addressed the wave of protests, saying that \"rioters must be put in their place\". He said shopkeepers' original protest about the collapse in foreign exchange rates was \"legitimate\", but he claimed people \"provoked by the enemy\" were taking advantage to shout anti-government slogans.Protests have spread to a number of cities and towns with running battles reported between security forces and demonstrators. On Saturday the state-affiliated Mehr and Fars news agencies reported that two protesters and a member of the security forces were killed in the western town of Malekshahi when, they said, protesters tried to enter a police station.The EU said it was \"concerned\" by reports of deaths and called for Tehran to exercise \"maximum restraint\" against the protesters as well as upholding their right to \"freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly\".The protests began in Tehran, with shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and the protests had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.Two people have since died in clashes between protesters and security forces in the south-western city of Lordegan, according to the semi-official Fars news agency and the human rights group Hengaw, which said they were protesters, naming them as Ahmad Jalil and Sajjad Valamanesh.Three people were killed in Azna, while another died in Kouhdasht, all in the west of the country, Fars reported. It did not specify whether they were demonstrators or security forces personnel.One death was reported in Fuladshahr, central Iran, and another casualty in Marvdasht, in the south.BBC has not been able to independently verify the deaths.The demonstrations have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly, but they have not been on the same scale.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has previously said he will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.

    "body": "The charity Brigitte Bardot established has issued a warning about \"scam\" merchandise purporting to fund its work following the French actress's death.The Brigitte Bardot Foundation said it was aware of \"crude fabrications\" being advertised online alongside claims the proceeds will go to the animal welfare charity.It threatened to take legal action against anyone taking part in \"these alleged illegal fundraising efforts\", stating: \"Everyone is asked to respect the memory of the deceased.\"Bardot died aged 91 last Sunday. After revolutionising 1950s French cinema and becoming a symbol of sexual liberation, she quit acting to devote her life to animals.But the actress-turned-activist courted controversy later in life over a string of remarks about Muslims, gay people and the #MeToo movement. She was fined five times for inciting racial hatred.Her death prompted tributes in France, with President Emmanuel Macron saying the nation was mourning \"a legend of the century\".\"Her films, her voice, her dazzling glory, her initials, her sorrows, her generous passion for animals, her face that became Marianne, Brigitte Bardot embodied a life of freedom,\" he said.But now, online scammers were co-opting her iconic image for \"vulgar and despicable attempts to exploit her legacy\", the Brigitte Bardot Foundation said.It warned of \"the spread on the internet and social networks of offers for sale of photographs, AI-assisted montages, and all kinds of media\" reproducing her image, including \"in fabricated situations\".\"These are crude fabrications, illicit offers and sales, and purported fundraising campaigns that have never received any endorsement from the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, which cannot condone these scams,\" it wrote in a statement on Saturday.Bardot starred in nearly 50 films including And God Created Woman and Contempt, setting fashion trends with her tousled blonde hair and bold eyeliner, before becoming the model for Marianne, the personified symbol of France.She retired from acting in 1973, aged 39, declaring: \"I gave my youth and beauty to men, I give my wisdom and experience to animals.\" Bardot would go on to launch her animal rights foundation 13 years later.Her funeral will take place on Wednesday in Saint-Tropez, southern France, where she lived for decades, in a cemetery overlooking her home and the Mediterranean.The Brigitte Bardot Foundation told French news agency AFP that the private burial  will be \"no frills\" and \"without fuss\", in keeping with her spirit.",

IS imposed jihadist rule over parts of Syria and Iraq until 2019.\"This action shows our UK leadership, and determination to stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies, to stamp out any resurgence of Daesh and their dangerous and violent ideologies in the Middle East,\" UK Defence Secretary John Healey said.EPA/ShutterstockThe MoD said no civilians were harmed in the strikesRAF aircraft have carried out patrols over Syria to \"prevent any attempted resurgence\" of IS following its defeat at the battle of Baghuz in 2019, the ministry said.\"I want to thank all the members of our armed forces involved in this operation for their professionalism and their courage,\" Healey said.\"They were among thousands of British personnel deployed over Christmas and New Year. This operation, to eliminate dangerous terrorists who threaten our way of life, shows how our armed forces are ready to step up, all year round, keeping Britain secure at home and strong abroad.\" The RAF has been using aerial drones and manned aircraft to strike IS fighters and targets as part of the international coalition since 2014. The United Nations says IS still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.In November, Syria - under the leadership of new President Ahmed al-Sharaa - became the 90th country to join a US-led coalition to combat the group.The coalition, officials say, is aimed at eliminating remaining elements of the so-called Islamic State and stemming the flow of foreign militants to the Middle East.Last month, the US military carried out what it called a \"massive strike\" against IS targets in Syria, following an ambush that killed two American soldiers and a civilian interpreter in Palmyra.",

    "body": "1 hour agoTom BennettGetty ImagesWhen US forces conducted a night raid on the Venezuelan capital Caracas, they didn't just drag President Nicolás Maduro from his compound and put him on a boat to New York - they took his wife too.Cilia Flores, 69, has long been seen as one of the most powerful figures in Venezuela, a political operator in her own right who for decades has shaped the country's fortunes.After years leading Venezuela's National Assembly, she helped consolidate her husband's grip on power after his 2013 presidential election victory.As First Lady, she was dubbed \"First Warrior\" by Maduro. But in that role she publicly took a backseat - presenting a more family-oriented face to what critics say was a brutal regime.She hosted a TV show, Con Cilia en Familia, and made occasional appearances on state television to dance salsa with her husband. But behind-the-scenes, she is thought to have been one of Maduro's key advisers, and an architect of his political survival.Flores has faced allegations of corruption and nepotism, and in recent years her family members have been found guilty in US courts of cocaine smuggling. She will now face drug trafficking and weapons charges in a New York court, along with her husband.Flores met Maduro in the early 1990s, when - as a young up-and-coming lawyer - she took on the defence of the plotters of the failed 1992 coup attempt.Chief among them: Hugo Chávez, the man who would later become president.It was during those years that she met Maduro, who at the time was working for Chávez as a security guard.AFP via Getty ImagesMonths of unrest followed Venezuela's failed 1992 coup, which saw a number of military commanders, including Hugo Chávez, imprisoned\"I met Cilia in life,\" Maduro recounted. \"She was the lawyer for several imprisoned patriotic military officers. But she was also Commander Chávez's lawyer and, well, being Commander Chávez's lawyer in prison... tough.\"\"I met her during those years of struggle, and then, well, she caught my eye.\"From then, both their fates became linked to Chávez and his political movement, known as Chavismo.After Chávez won the presidency in 1998, Flores quickly rose through the political ranks, joining the National Assembly in 2000 and becoming its leader in 2006.For six years she led a virtually one-party parliament, with the main opposition parties refusing to participate in elections, saying they were not free and fair.When Chávez died in 2013, Flores threw her weight behind Maduro, who narrowly won the subsequent presidential election.AFP via Getty ImagesFlores remained close with Chávez until his death in 2013Months later the pair married, formalising a years-long relationship in which they'd lived together, raising children from previous relationships: three of hers and one of his.\"To her detractors, she is seen as part of a deeply corrupt, human-rights-abusing and brutal government,\" says Christopher Sabatini, Senior Fellow and Chatham House's Latin America programme.\"She was a power behind the throne,\" he adds. \"But like any good power behind the throne, you really didn't see her hand that much, so no one really knew how powerful she was.\"Getty ImagesAs president of the National Assembly, Flores was one of the most powerful figures in VenezuelaAcross her career, she has faced numerous allegations of corruption.In 2012, she was accused by unions of nepotism for influencing the hiring of up to 40 people, including numerous members of her family.\"My family came here and I am very proud that they are my family. I will defend them,\" she responded.In November 2015, she became embroiled in the \"Narco nephews\" case, when two of her nephews -  Francisco Flores de Freitas and Efrain Antonio Campo Flores - were arrested in Haiti in a sting operation by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).They were caught trying to smuggle 800kg of cocaine into the US.Flores accused US authorities of having \"kidnapped\" her nephews - but a judge sentenced the two men to 18 years in prison for drug trafficking. They were returned to Venezuela in 2022 as part of a prisoner swap under the Biden administration.But last month, the Trump administration announced fresh sanctions on the two nephews - as well as a third nephew, Carlos Erik Malpica Flores - with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying: \"Nicolás Maduro and his criminal associates in Venezuela are flooding the United States with drugs that are poisoning the American people.\"\"Treasury is holding the regime and its circle of cronies and companies accountable for its continued crimes,\" he added.The newly unsealed indictment against Flores accuses her - among other things - of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in 2007 to arrange a meeting between \"a large-scale drug trafficker\" and the director of Venezuela's National Anti-Drug Office.She is expected in court on Monday.

    "body": "'Deeply shocked': World leaders react to US attack on Venezuela 14 hours agoClaire KeenanTrump on Venezuela: \"We are going to run the country\"Leaders around the world have responded with a mix of condemnation and support to the US capture of Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro. Following a large-scale strike on Venezuela on Saturday, Maduro and his wife were captured by US forces and removed from the country. The pair have been indicted on drug charges in New York. In an initial response, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his government would \"shed no tears\" for the end of Maduro's regime.Neighbouring Latin American countries condemned the actions, as did Venezuela's long-term allies, Russia and China. China said it was \"deeply shocked and strongly condemns\" the use of force against a sovereign country and its president. Russia accused the US of committing \"an act of armed aggression\".Iran, which is locked in its own dispute with Trump over his promise of intervention in its country, called the strikes a \"flagrant violation of the country's national sovereignty\".Trump said the US will \"run\" Venezuela \"until we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition\". Many Latin American leaders condemned the US actions. Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva wrote on X that the actions \"cross an unacceptable line\", adding that \"attacking countries in flagrant violation of international law is the first step toward a world of violence, chaos, and instability\". Colombian President Gustavo Petro called the strikes an \"assault on the sovereignty\" of Latin America, while Chile's President Gabriel Boric expressed \"concern and condemnation\" and called for \"a peaceful solution to the serious crisis affecting the country\".Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel accused the US of a \"criminal attack\", while Uruguay said in an official statement that it was monitoring developments \"with attention and serious concern\" and \"rejects, as it always has, military intervention\".Trump has indicated that Cuba could become part of a broader US policy in the region, calling it a failing nation. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Cuba was a disaster run by incompetent leaders who supported Maduro's administration and that the government in Havana should be concerned.The Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello urged citizens to remain calm and to trust the country's leadership and military, saying \"the world needs to speak out about this attack\" according to news agency Reuters. But Argentinian President Javier Milei – who Trump has described as his \"favourite president\" – wrote \"freedom moves forward\" and \"long live freedom\" on social media.Getty ImagesGovernment supporters hold posters of the late Hugo Chávez (left) and Venezuela's President Nicolás MaduroMeanwhile, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer refused to be drawn into whether or not the military action may have broken international law.He did not condemn the US strikes in an interview with the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme on Saturday morningHe said he was waiting to establish all the facts but would not \"shy away from this\", adding he was a \"lifelong advocate of international law\".The UK was not involved in the strikes and Sir Keir said he had not spoken to Trump about the operation.Later on Saturday, he posted on X that the UK \"regarded Maduro as an illegitimate president and we shed no tears about the end of his regime\".\"The UK government will discuss the evolving situation with US counterparts in the days ahead as we seek a safe and peaceful transition to a legitimate government that reflects the will of the Venezuelan people,\" he added.The EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas reiterated the bloc's position that Maduro lacks legitimacy, that there should be a peaceful transition of power, and that the principles of international law must be respected.French President Emmanuel Macron said the transition of power \"must be peaceful, democratic, and respectful of the will of the Venezuelan people\" in a post on X.He added he hoped González - the opposition's 2024 presidential candidate - could ensure the transition.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the legality of the US operation was \"complex\" and international law in general must apply. He warned that \"political instability must not be allowed to arise in Venezuela\".UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was \"deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected\", his spokesperson said. He was \"deeply alarmed\" by the strikes, which set a \"dangerous precedent\". In the US, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said: \"Let me be clear, Maduro is an illegitimate dictator, but launching military action without congressional authorisation, without a federal plan for what comes next, is reckless.\"Elsewhere, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, a staunch US ally, congratulated Trump on his \"bold and historic leadership on behalf of freedom and justice\". Canada's Foreign Minister Anita Anand said \"Canada calls on all parties to respect international law and we stand by the people of Venezuela and their desire to live in a peaceful and democratic society\". Canada was engaging with international partners, she said. Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said \"international law is universal and binding for all states. \"The American intervention in Venezuela is not in accordance with international law.\" More on this story",

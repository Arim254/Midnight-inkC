    "body": "As the world inches back to a pre-WW2 order, the 'middle powers' face a grave new challenge51 minutes agoAllan LittleSenior correspondentBBCI had been asked to give a key-note speech at a conference at Columbia University's Journalism School. It was January 2002. Two planes had been flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Centre months earlier and you could still feel how wounded the city felt. You could read it in the faces of New Yorkers you spoke to.In my speech I made a few opening remarks about what the United States had meant to me. \"I was born 15 years after the Second World War,\" I said, \"in a world America made. The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement.\"American military might had won the war in the west, I continued. It had stopped the further westward expansion of Soviet power.I talked briefly about the transformational effect of the Marshall Plan, through which the United States had given Europe the means to rebuild its shattered economies, and to re-establish the institutions of democracy.AFP via Getty Images'I was born 15 years after the Second World War in a world America made,' Allan Little told an audience. 'The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement'I told the audience, composed mostly of students of journalism, that as a young reporter I had myself witnessed the inspiring culmination of all this in 1989 when I'd stood in Wenceslas Square in Prague. Back then I'd watched, awestruck, as Czechs and Slovaks demanded an end to Soviet occupation, and to a hated communist dictatorship, so that they too could be part of the community of nations that we called, simply, \"the West\", bound together by shared values, at the head of which sat the the United States of America.I looked up from my notes at the faces of the audience. Near the front of the lecture hall sat a young man. He looked about 20. Tears were running down his face and he was quietly trying to suppress a sob.At a drinks reception afterwards he approached me. \"I'm sorry I lost it in there,\" he said. \"Your words: right now we are feeling raw and vulnerable. America needs to hear this stuff from its foreign friends.\"In that moment I thought how lucky my generation, and his, had been, to be alive in an era in which the international system was regulated by rules, a world that had turned its back on the unconstrained power of the Great Powers.Getty ImagesDonald Trump believes the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too longBut it was the words of one of his classmates that come back to me now. He had arrived in New York just a few days before 9/11 from his native Pakistan to study at Columbia. He likened the United States to Imperial Rome.\"If you are lucky enough to live within the walls of the Imperial Citadel, which is to say here in the US, you experience American power as something benign. It protects you and your property. It bestows freedom by upholding the rule of law. It is accountable to the people through democratic institutions.\"But if, like me, you live on the Barbarian fringes of Empire, you experience American power as something quite different. It can do anything to you, with impunity… And you can't stop it or hold it to account.\"His words made me consider the much heralded rules-based international order from another angle: from the point of view of much of the Global South. And how its benefits have never been universally distributed, something that the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reminded an audience at Davos last week.ReutersCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech in Davos called for 'the middle powers' to act together\"We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false,\" that young Pakistani student admitted all those years ago. \"That the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient. That trade rules were enforced asymmetrically. And we knew that international law applied with varying rigour depending on the identity of the accused or victim.\"\"Don't you find it interesting,\" he asked, \"that the US, the country that came into existence in a revolt against the arbitrary exercise of [British] power is, in our day, the most powerful exponent of arbitrary power?\"A new world order or back to the future?Donald Trump came to Davos last week clearly determined to bend the Europeans to his will over Greenland. He wanted ownership, he said.He declared that Denmark had only \"added one more dog sled\" to defend the territory. That speaks volumes to the undisguised contempt with which he and many in his inner circle appear to hold certain European allies.\"I fully share your loathing of European freeloading,\" Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told a WhatsApp group that included Vice President JD Vance last year, adding \"PATHETIC\". (He hadn't realised that the Editor of The Atlantic magazine had apparently been added to the group chat.)Then President Trump himself told Fox News recently that, during the war in Afghanistan, Nato had sent \"some troops\" but that they had \"stayed a little back, a little off the front lines\".The comments provoked anger among UK politicians and veterans' families. The UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer branded Trump's remarks \"insulting and frankly appalling\".The UK prime minister spoke to Trump on Saturday, after which the US president used his Truth Social platform to praise UK troops as being \"among the greatest of all warriors\".Carl Court - Pool/Getty ImagesSir Keir Starmer said US President Donald Trump's remarks about Nato troops in Afghanistan were \"insulting and frankly appalling\"We know from the White House's National Security Strategy, published in December, that in his second term, Trump intends to unshackle the United States from the system of transnational bodies created, in part by Washington, to regulate international affairs. That document spells out the means by which the United States will put \"America First\" at the heart of US security strategy by using whatever powers they have, ranging from economic sanctions and trade tariffs to military intervention, to bend smaller and weaker nations into alignment with US interests.It is a strategy which privileges strength: a return to a world in which the Great Powers carve out spheres of influence.The danger in this for what Canada's Prime Minister called \"the middle powers\" is clear. \"If you're not at the table,\" he said, \"you're on the menu\".Re-interpretation of the Monroe DoctrineIn Davos last week, America's allies, especially Canada and Europe, were laying to rest what is now commonly called the rules-based intentional order, and in some cases mourning its demise.But, as the young Pakistani student at Colombia journalism school argued all those years ago, to large parts of the rest of the world it has not seemed, in the last 80 years, that the United States, and on occasions some of its friends, felt restrained by rules.More from InDepth\"After World War Two, we saw, under the so-called rules-based international order multiple interventions by the United States in Latin America,\" says Dr Christopher Sabatini, Senior Research Fellow for Latin America at Chatham House.\"It's not new. There are patterns of intervention that go all the way back to 1823. There's a term I use for American policymakers who advocate for unilateral US intervention. I call them \"backyard-istas\" - those who see Latin America as their backyard.\"In 1953, the CIA, assisted by the British Secret Intelligence Services, orchestrated a coup that overthrew the government of Mohammad Mossadeq in Iran. He had wanted to audit the books of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later part of BP), and when it refused to co-operate, Mossadeq threatened to nationalise it.For posing a threat to British economic interests, he was overthrown and Britain and the US threw their weight behind the increasingly dictatorial Shah.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesThe CIA played a key role in the 1953 coup which ousted Iran's democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammad MossadeqAt the same time, the US was conspiring to overthrow the elected government of Guatemala, which had implemented an ambitious programme of land reform that threatened to harm the profitability of the American United Fruit Company. Again with active CIA collusion, the left-wing president Jacobo Arbenz was toppled and replaced by a series of US-backed authoritarian rulers.In 1983 the US invaded the Caribbean island of Grenada, after a Marxist coup. This was a country of which the late Queen, Elizabeth II, was head of state.And the US invaded Panama in 1989, and arrested the military leader Manuel Noriega. He spent all but the last few months of his life in prison.These interventions were all functions of the Monroe Doctrine, first promulgated by President James Monroe in 1823. It asserted America's right to dominate the Western hemisphere and keep European powers from trying to meddle in the newly independent states of Latin America. The post-war rules based international order did not deter the US from imposing its will on weaker neighbours.Getty Images / CorbisPanama's leader Manuel Noriega was forcibly removed by US troops in 1989 and spent almost all of the rest of his life in jailWhen it was announced by the fifth president of the US, James Monroe, the doctrine that bears his name was widely seen as an expression of US solidarity with its neighbours, a strategy to protect them from attempts by the European great powers to recolonise them: the US, after all, shared with them a set of republican values and a history of anti-colonial struggle.But the Doctrine quickly became an assertion of Washington's right to dominate its neighbours and use any means, up to and including military intervention, to bend their policies into alignment with American interests. President Theodore Roosevelt, in 1904, said it gave the US \"international police power\" to intervene in countries where there was \"wrongdoing\".So could it be that President Trump's re-interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine is simply part of a continuum in US foreign policy?Getty ImagesThe Monroe Doctrine was first promulgated by US President James Monroe (pictured) in 1823\"In the Guatemala coup, in 1954, that was entirely owned by the US. They orchestrated the entire takeover of the country,\" says Dr Christopher Sabatini.\"The coup on Chile in 1971 [against the left-wing Prime Minister Salvador Allende] wasn't orchestrated by the CIA but the United States said it would accept a coup.\"During the Cold War, the main motivation for intervention was the perception that Soviet-backed parties were gaining ground domestically, representing Communist advances into the Western hemisphere. In our own day, the perceived enemy is no longer Communism, but drug-trafficking and migration.That difference aside, President Trump's reassertion of the Monroe Doctrine \"absolutely is 'back to the future',\" says the historian Jay Sexton, author of The Monroe Doctrine: Empire and Nation in Nineteenth Century America.Getty ImagesGuatamalan President Jacobo Arbenz was overthrown by a US-backed coup in 1954\"The other thing that gives Trump's United States a 19th century feel is his unpredictability, his volatility. Observers could never really predict what the United States would do next.\"We don't know what the future holds but we do known from even a cursory look at modern history, from 1815 onwards [the end of the Napoleonic wars], that Great Power rivalries are really destabilising. They lead to conflict.\"Cohesion among the alliesAmerican unilateralism may not be new. What is new is that this time, it is America's friends and allies that find themselves on the receiving end of American power.Suddenly, Europeans and Canadians are getting a taste of something long familiar to other parts of the world - that arbitrary exercise of US power that the young Pakistani journalism student articulated so clearly to me in the weeks after 9/11.For the first year of his second term, European leaders used flattery in their approach to Trump. Starmer, for example, had King Charles invite him to make a second state visit to the UK, an honour no other US president in history has been granted. The Secretary General of Nato Mark Rutte, referred to him, bizarrely, as \"daddy\".Getty ImagesKing Charles invited Donald Trump to make a second state visit to the UK - an honour no other US president had receivedBut Trump's approach to towards Europe brought him clear success. Previous presidents, including Barack Obama and Joe Biden also believed the European allies were not pulling their weight in Nato and wanted them to spend more on their own security. Only Trump succeeded in making them act: in response to his threats, they agreed to raise their defence spending from around two per cent of GDP to five per cent, something unthinkable even a year ago.Greenland, however, seems to have been a game-changer. When Trump threatened Danish sovereignty in Greenland, the allies began to cohere around a new-found defiance, and resolved not, this time, to bend.Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney gave voice to this moment. In his pivotal speech in Davos he said this was a moment of \"rupture\" with the old rules-based international order - in the new world of Great Power politics, \"the middle powers\" needed to act together.Getty ImagesPrevious presidents had also believed the European allies should spend more on their own security - only Trump succeeded in making them actIt is rare, at Davos, for an audience to rise to its feet and award a speaker a standing ovation. But they did it for Carney, and you felt, in that moment, a cohesion forming among the allies.And in an instant, the threat of tariffs lifted. Trump has gained nothing over Greenland that the US hasn't already had for decades - the right, with Denmark's blessing, to build military bases, stage unlimited personnel there, and even to mineral exploitation.The challenge facing 'middle powers' todayThere is no doubt that Trump's America First strategy is popular with his Maga base. They share his view that the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too long. And European leaders, in agreeing to increase their defence spending, have accepted that President Trump was right: that the imbalance was no longer fair or sustainable.ReutersIn June 2004 I reported on the celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy. There were still many living World War Two veterans and thousands of those who had crossed the Chanel 60 years earlier came back to the beaches that day - many of them from the US.They wanted no talk of the heroism or courage of their youth. We watched them go one by one or in little groups to the cemeteries to find the graves of the young men they'd known and whom they'd left behind in the soil of liberated France.We watched the allied heads of government pay tribute to those old men. But I found myself thinking not so much of the battles they'd fought and the bravery and sacrifices of their younger selves, but of the peace that they'd gone home to build when the fighting was over.The world they bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents. For they were born into a world of Great Power rivalries, in which, in Mark Carney's words, \"the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must\".This was the generation that went home to build the rules-based international order, because they had learned the hard way what a system without rules, without laws, can lead to. They wanted no going back to that.ShutterstockThe world the veterans bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents, writes Allan LittleThose born in the decades after the war may have made the mistake of believing that the world could never go back to that.And 24 years ago, as I gave my talk in a New York City still traumatised by 9/11, did I too make the mistake of thinking the post-World War Two order, underpinned, as it was, by American might, was the new permanent normal? I think I did.For we did not foresee then a world in which trust in traditional sources of news and information would be corroded by a rising cynicism, turbo-charged by social media and, increasingly now, AI.In any age of economic stagnation and extremes of inequality, popular trust in democratic institutions corrodes. It has been corroding not just in the US but across the western world for decades now. As such Trump may be a symptom, not a cause, of Carney's \"rupture\" with the post-World War Two order.Watching those old men making their way through the Normandy cemeteries was a graphic and poignant reminder: democracy, the rule of law, accountable government are not naturally occurring phenomena; they are not even, historically speaking, normal. They have to be fought for, built, sustained, defended.And that is the challenge from here facing what Mark Carney called \"the middle powers\".Top picture credit: AFP/ReutersBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "German police have arrested a Lebanese national on suspicion of being a member of Hamas and planning attacks in Europe.The man, named as \"Mohammad S\", was stopped at Berlin's Brandenburg Airport after arriving from Beirut on Friday evening.Federal prosecutors said that in August 2025 he helped procure 300 rounds of ammunition and was involved in an alleged plot to attack Jewish and Israeli institutions.He is due to be brought before a federal judge who will decide on a pretrial detention.Hamas, which controlled Gaza but has been severely weakened by Israeli operations in the territory, is considered a terrorist organisation by the US, UK, Israel and many other countries.The militant Palestinian group carried out the attacks on Israel in October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 people taken hostage.Since then, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli military action.German authorities say \"Mohammad S\" colluded with \"Abed Al G\", one of three alleged Hamas members arrested last October over planned attacks on Jewish and Israeli institutions.The three were reportedly arrested while meeting for a weapons handover in Berlin. Two of them are Germany nationals, another is from Lebanon.Around the time of the arrests, police searches also took place in the German cities of Leipzig and Oberhausen, Der Spiegel reported.Separately, in November, German authorities arrested another suspected member of Hamas - also a Lebanese national - near the border with the Czech Republic.",

    "body": "11 hours agoReutersZhang Youxia was widely seen as President Xi's closest military allyChina's defence ministry says it has opened an investigation into the country's highest-ranking general over \"grave violations of discipline and the law\".The ministry gave no further details about accusations against General Zhang Youxia, who has widely been seen as President Xi Jinping's closest military ally. However in China the accusation of wrongdoing is usually a euphemism for corruption.In its announcement, the ministry said another senior military officer, General Liu Zhenli, was also under investigation.Their removal follows the expulsion of nine top generals in October - one of the largest public crackdowns on the military in decades. Zhang, 75, is a vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) - the Communist Party group headed by President Xi which controls the armed forces.Zhang also sits on the party's top decision-making body, the 24-person Politburo.His father was one of the founding generals of the Chinese Communist Party.Zhang joined the army in 1968 and is one of only a few senior leaders with combat experience. He was kept in office beyond the customary retirement age for China's military, suggesting President Xi's confidence in him until now.The announcement comes days after rumours appeared that Zhang and Liu could be facing an investigation as they were not present at a high-level party event in December.ReutersPresident Xi has been accused of using corruption investigations to purge political rivalsSince coming to power, President Xi has launched waves of anti-corruption drives through various departments and this campaign has recently focused heavily on the military.He has called corruption \"the biggest threat\" to the Communist Party and said the fight against it  \"remains grave and complex\".Advocates say the policy promotes good governance, but others believe it has been used as a tool to purge political rivals.With the probe into Zhang and Liu, the CMC is now down from the original seven members to just two: Xi, who is the chairman, and Zhang Shengmin, who is responsible for the military's disciplinary affairs.More from the BBC",

    "body": "20 hours agoKaty Watson,Australia correspondentandHarry SekulichA young boy who was bitten by a shark in Sydney Harbour last week has died in hospital. Twelve-year-old Nico Antic had been jumping off a rock ledge with friends on 18 January when he was attacked by what authorities suspected was a bull shark.\"We are heartbroken to share that our son, Nico has passed away,\" his parents Lorena and Juan said in a statement. The incident was one of four reported shark attacks along the New South Wales coast over two days.\"Nico was a happy, friendly, and sporty young boy with the most kind and generous spirit. He was always full of life and that's how we'll remember him,\" his family, who were originally from Argentina, added.Nico's friends were praised for their bravery after jumping into the water to help him after he was attacked last Sunday afternoon.However he suffered serious leg injuries and was taken to Sydney Children's Hospital in a critical condition. He was placed in an induced coma after undergoing surgery.An online fundraiser set up for Nico's family has raised $240,000 (£121,308).There has been a spate of reported shark attacks along Australia's east coast in the past week, three of them in Sydney. On Monday, a surfer on Sydney's northern beaches escaped a lurking shark without physical injury, while hours later a 27-year-old man suffered \"life-changing\" injuries in a shark attack at a nearby beach. One day later, a man on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales was pulled from the water after surviving a shark bite.The man, 39, sustained a chest wound and was taken to hospital. The attacks followed several days of heavy rain, which experts say created a \"perfect storm\" of conditions for bull sharks who prefer murky water. They also say rain flushes nutrients into the water, which can draw sharks closer to shore.Beaches across Sydney were closed to protect the public until weather improved, many of which have reopened for the Australia Day public holiday long weekend.",

    "body": "3 hours agoSakshi VenkatramanUS reporterUS President Donald Trump has threatened to slap a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if the country strikes a trade deal with China. \"If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,\" Trump said on Truth Social. It is unclear what deal Trump is referring to in his social media post. Last week, Canada's Prime Minister Carney announced a \"strategic partnership\" with China, and agreed to reduce tariffs. At the time, Trump called the move \"a good thing\". But tensions between the US and Canada have grown in recent days, after Carney said in a speech in Davos that the US-led world order had been ruptured.Carney also urged other \"middle powers\" to band together in the face of economic coercion by \"greater powers\", though he did not mention Trump by name.Trump responded to the remarks in his own speech the next day, saying: \"Canada lives because of the United States.\"The US president also withdrew an invitation for Canada to join his new Board of Peace.On Saturday, Trump said in his social media post that if Carney \"thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken\". The BBC has contacted the White House and Carney's office for comment.Canada's US trade minister Dominic LeBlanc said in a statement: \"There is no pursuit of a free trade deal with China.\"\"What was achieved was resolution on several important tariff issues.\"LeBlanc said the government was focused on building a stronger Canadian economy and strengthening trade partnerships \"throughout the world\".Canada has been seeking to diversify trade away from the US, its largest trade partner, following the uncertainty caused by Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs.Under the agreement reached between Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping last week, China will lower levies on Canadian canola oil from 85% to 15% by March, while Canada will  tax Chinese EVs at the most-favoured-nation rate, 6.1% – down from 100%.The deal was seen as a breakthrough after years of strained ties and tit-for-tat tariffs, and could see more Chinese investments in Canada.Carney said the progress made with China sets Canada up \"well for the new world order\".",

    "body": "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has weighed in on a separatist movement in Alberta, saying the western Canadian province is a \"natural partner for the US\". \"Alberta has a wealth of natural resources, but they won't let them build a pipeline to the Pacific,\" Bessent told an American right-wing commentator in an interview on Thursday. \"I think we should let them come down into the US, and Alberta is a natural partner for the US. They have great resources. The Albertans are very independent people.\" The top US official's comments come amid strained ties between US and Canada, and as signatures are being collected in the province seeking an independence referendum. In comments to conservative host Jack Posobiec, Bessent went on to say there is a \"rumour that they may have a referendum on whether they want to stay in Canada or not\". A group in Alberta has until May to collect at least 178,000 signatures - or 10% of eligible voters - for a referendum campaign. Asked about Bessent's remarks on Friday, federal Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said he'd tell him \"thanks but no thanks, we will do our own things\".He said Canadians are \"able to develop our natural resources at home\" and pointed to a deal recently inked by Prime Minister Mark Carney with Alberta that opens the door for an oil pipeline to the Pacific. It's a project long pushed for by Canada's oil heartland but one which faces significant hurdles.A spokesman for Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said in a statement to the BBC that the province supports new pipelines \"west, east, north, and south, and we will continue to work with our US partners on building more pipeline capacity to US markets\". \"But the premier also believes the overwhelming majority of Albertans are not interested in becoming a US state\".Late last year over 430,000 signatures were gathered for a petition calling for a united Canada to counter the separatist push, and polls indicate a majority of Albertans want to stay in Canada. Many supporters of separatism have also told media they are seeking independence from Canada - not to join the US. Mitch Sylvestre, who is spearheading the referendum petition, told the CBC on Friday he doesn't think anyone in his movement is eyeing the US.He said he thought Bessent's comment on Alberta and the US being \"natural partners\" was obvious given the energy trade between them.Still, some organisers of the movement have said they have travelled to Washington to meet officials from the Trump administration.Meanwhile, trade talks between the US and Canada are on ice, and President Donald Trump has expressed irritation with the prime minister over a blunt speech he delivered at the World Economic Forum in Davos calling out \"great powers\" for weaponising their economic might.Trump responded in his own speech with: \"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\"Other US officials have also criticised Carney's speech, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who this week accused Canada of being \"arrogant\" and Carney of pandering to a domestic audience by adopting an anti-US stance.",

Alex Honnold, who scaled El Capitan in California's Yosemite National Park without a rope in 2017, said on Saturday: \"Sadly it's raining in Taipei right now so I don't get to go climbing.\" The skyscraper in Taiwan's capital measures 508m (1,667ft) and is made of steel, glass and concrete. It contains eight sections, each with a slight overhang designed to resemble joints on a bamboo stick.Netflix - which will stream the event - says there will be a delay on the live feed should the worst happen.\"It's obviously a conversation that everybody has,\" Netflix executive Jeff Gaspin told Variety magazine. \"We'll cut away. We have a 10-second delay. Nobody expects or wants to see anything like that to happen.\"The climb is now due to take place on Sunday.  Announcing the delay, Netflix said: \"Safety remains our top priority, and we appreciate your understanding.\"Taipei 101 has been conquered before. In 2004, France's Alain Robert, who called himself Spiderman, climbed it in four hours using a safety belt and rope.Netflix said there will be three stages to Honnold's rope-free climb. First, there is an initital 113m section of sloping steel and glass followed by the eight \"bamboo\" boxes before reaching the final stage which includes scaling the spire at the very top of the tower. Getty ImagesTaipei 101's surfaces were deemed too wet for a climb on Saturday Honnold, 40, who is married with two children, said it was \"a lifelong dream\" to scale a skyscraper.His historic 2017 ascent of El Capitan without a rope was documented in the film Free Solo, which won an Academy Award.An enormous sheer granite rock face of approximately 3,000 feet (915m), El Capitan is a major landmark in Yosemite and entices big-wall rock climbers from all over the world.More from the BBC",

    "body": "11 hours agoVitaliy ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC MonitoringUkraine is now living through its most difficult winter in recent memory. With January temperatures plummeting below -15C, Russia has been attacking energy infrastructure, leaving about a million Ukrainians without heating.The capital, Kyiv, is the main target of such attacks. Following the latest Russian bombardment overnight into 24 January, almost 6,000 apartment blocks were left without heating, according to mayor Vitaly Klitschko.This is the third such Russian attack targeting Kyiv's heating infrastructure in little more than two weeks, after strikes on 9 and 20 January also left hundreds of thousands freezing in their flats.\"Living in Kyiv is a bit of a gamble these days,\" one resident of the Ukrainian capital, Rita, told the BBC. \"If you have heating and gas, there is no electricity and water. If you have electricity and water, there is no heating. \"Coming home is like playing a guessing game every day - will I be able to shower or have hot tea, or neither? And of course missiles and drones come on top of all that.\" She says she has to go to bed wearing a hat and several layers of clothing.What is making things much worse for Ukraine and easier for Russia is the widespread prevalence of apartment blocks that rely on communal central heating - where water is heated up elsewhere and then pumped into their radiators.Heating plants in Ukraine are huge and many thousands of people are affected when they are targeted by Russian forces. Ukraine says that all such power plants have now been hit.Such attacks also disrupt electricity supplies, but while a generator or battery pack might help in this situation, heating is less straightforward - especially when there is also no electricity to power your heater.Kyivteploenergo, the monopoly supplying heating and hot water in the Ukrainian capital, told the BBC \"the absolute majority\" of houses in Kyiv rely on its services. It said it could not share the exact number for security reasons.In Zaporizhzhia, a frontline city home to 750,000 people, almost three-quarters of residents rely on central heating, according to Maksym Rohalsky, the head of the local association of apartment block dwellers.Before Russia's full-scale invasion of 2022, about 11 million households in Ukraine relied on central heating, compared to seven million autonomously heated households, Ukrainian energy expert Yuriy Korolchuk said. Cities across the Soviet Union, including in Ukraine, were the focus of huge construction programmes launched in the 1950s to mass produce cheap housing.The landscapes of cities in the former USSR are dominated by ubiquitous nine-storey residential buildings made from pre-fabricated concrete panels, known as \"panelki\", or smaller five-storey blocks of flats known as \"khrushchevki\", after Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, who oversaw their construction in the 1950s and 1960s.Heating to such houses is supplied by large plants known as TETs - an acronym that stands for \"heat and electricity centrals\" in Ukrainian as they generate electricity as well as heat.Detached houses occupied by a single family, known as \"private houses\" in Ukraine, are normally found in rural areas and are rare in cities.\"Ukraine inherited the Soviet heating system and it hasn't changed anything, it stays predominantly centralised,\" Korolchuk told the BBC. \"These heating plants were not designed to be attacked with missiles or drones, that's why these vulnerabilities came to the fore during the war.\"According to him, this is a new tactic used by Russia.\"During the previous winters, there were no such strikes against the heating system. They happened only occasionally, and they didn't directly target heating plants,\" he added.Referring to ongoing talks to end the war, he says \"the factor of negotiations is now possibly playing a role, it's a form of pressure\".Large centralised installations bring about efficiencies of scale, but should they be targeted by bombs or drones, the consequences can be devastating for hundreds of thousands of people.The Ukrainian government is acutely aware of this vulnerability, and is planning to reduce it by making individual heating points mandatory at apartment blocks.However, undoing decades of Soviet urban planning will not be quick or easy.",

    "body": "Pentagon to offer 'more limited' support to US allies in defence strategy shift17 hours agoClaire KeenanReutersHomeland security is the top priority in the Pentagon's new National Defense StrategyThe US will offer \"more limited\" support to allies, according to the Pentagon's new National Defense Strategy.In a significant shift to its security priorities, the US Department of Defense now considers security of the US homeland and Western Hemisphere - not China - as its primary concern.Previous versions of the strategy -  published every four years - named the threat posed by China as the top defence priority. Relations with China will now be approached through \"strength, not confrontation\", the report says.The defence strategy reinforces recent calls from President Donald Trump, including for greater \"burden-sharing\" from allies in countering threats posed by Russia and North Korea.The new 34-page report follows last year's publication of the US National Security Strategy, which said Europe faced civilisational collapse and did not cast Russia as a threat to the US. At the time, Moscow said the document was \"largely consistent\" with its vision.By comparison, in 2018, the Pentagon described \"revisionist powers\", such as China and Russia, as the \"central challenge\" to US security.The new strategy calls on American allies to step up, saying partners have been \"content\" to let Washington subsidise their defence, although it denies the shift signals a US move towards \"isolationism\".\"To the contrary, it means a focused and genuinely strategic approach to the threats our nation faces,\" it says.Washington has long neglected the \"concrete interests\" of Americans, the report says, adding the US does not want to conflate American interests \"with those of the rest of the world – that a threat to a person halfway around the world is the same as to an American.\"Instead, it says allies, especially Europe, \"will take the lead against threats that are less severe for us but more so for them\". Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, is described as a \"persistent but manageable threat to NATO's eastern members\".Unlike in previous versions of the strategy, Taiwan, the self-governing island claimed by China, is not mentioned. However, the document does write that the US aims to \"prevent anyone, including China, from being able to dominate us or our allies\".Late last year, the US announced a vast arms sale to Taiwan worth $11bn (£8.2bn), leading China to hold military drills around the island in response.The strategy also outlines a \"more limited\" role for US deterrence of North Korea. South Korea is \"capable of taking primary responsibility\" for the task, it adds. In the 12 months since Trump began his second term as president, the US has seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, carried out strikes against alleged drug boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, and more recently, applied pressure on US allies to acquire Greenland. The strategy reiterates that the Pentagon \"will guarantee US military and commercial access to key terrain, especially the Panama Canal, Gulf of America, and Greenland\".The document says the Trump administration's approach will be \"fundamentally different from the grandiose strategies of the past post–Cold War administrations\". It adds: \"Out with utopian idealism; in with hardnosed realism.\"At the World Economic Forum earlier this week, Trump claimed the US had \"never gotten anything\" from Nato and \"we've never asked for anything\".He further criticised the organisation, incorrectly claiming \"the United States was paying for virtually 100% of Nato\".Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the old world order is \"not coming back\" and urged fellow middle powers - like South Korea, Canada and Australia - to come together. \"Middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu,\" Carney said at the Davos meeting. That came as French President Emmanuel Macron also warned of a \"shift towards a world without rules\". ",

Two teenagers are among those who remain unaccounted for, with the youngest aged 15 years old. Search teams located human remains beneath dirt and debris on Friday evening,  Police Superintendent Tim Anderson said, after a landslide hit a popular campsite in Mount Maunganui. \"This is heartbreaking news for the families and the dozens of people who have been working day and night, hoping for a positive outcome,\" Anderson said. In a separate incident, two people died - a grandmother and her grandchild - in a different landslide at Welcome Bay, nearby Mount Maunganui, public service broadcaster Radio New Zealand (RNZ) reported. Heavy rain has fallen on New Zealand's North Island for days, with more wet weather forecast for the area over the weekend.Police said conditions have added to the difficulty of rescue efforts, and described the scene at Mount Maunganui as \"incredibly challenging... to work through\".

    "body": "22 hours agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology correspondent, San FranciscoTikTok's new US joint venture has made changes to its privacy policy that include expanding the type of location data the company can collect from its 200 million American users.The new policy was published after investors closed a deal with TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance on Thursday to run the popular short-form video app's business in the US.The new joint venture said in its updated privacy terms that it may now \"collect precise location data, depending on your settings\" -  a change from the previous policy which allowed for the collection of \"approximate\" location data.TikTok did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment on the change. The company policy added that the sensitive personal information would be processed \"in accordance with applicable law\" and that users can turn off location services in their device settings at any time.Even before the new venture was established, TikTok collected location information based on a user's SIM card or IP address, or both.But it stopped short of collecting even approximate GPS information from American users operating the most updated version of the app, according to a 2024 version of its privacy policy.Precise location sharing hasn't yet been enabled in the US, where it is expected to be optional and turned off by default so users will be asked to opt in with a pop-up message. TikTok has not said when the update is due to reach American users.TikTok already collects similar data from users in the UK and Europe as part of a new \"Nearby Feed\" feature that lets users find events and businesses near them.The new American TikTok joint venture is also extending its permissions for gathering information about users interactions with TikTok's artificial intelligence (AI) tools.This includes prompts and questions submitted by users, as well as information about how, when, and where AI content was prompted or created.TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC is comprised of three managing investors including cloud computing giant Oracle, which is investing heavily in AI infrastructure and has taken on significant debt to finance its ambitions in the burgeoning space.Oracle is chaired by Larry Ellison, a Republican megadonor and longtime ally of US President Donald Trump, whose administration helped broker the US TikTok deal.The agreement follows years of tussling between Washington and Beijing that began in Trump's first presidential term, when he tried unsuccessfully to ban the app over national security concerns.In 2024, the US passed a law that required the platform to be banned in the US by January 2025 if ByteDance failed to sell its US operations to American investors.Trump repeatedly postponed the enforcement of legislation until the joint venture was finalised this week.The 2024 law was prompted in part by concerns about the possibility that Beijing might access the data of TikTok's American users.In a statement onThursday, the new joint venture said its mandate was \"to secure U.S. user data, apps and the algorithm through comprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity measures\".Oracle will oversee the retraining of TikTok's powerful content recommendation algorithm on existing American user data, the joint venture said in its statement, adding that the algorithm \"will be secured in Oracle's U.S. cloud environment.\"ByteDance retains a minority stake just shy of 20% in the joint venture.Other managing investors include the US tech investment firm Silver Lake and Abu-Dhabi state-owned investment fund MGX, which has done business with the Trump family's crypto venture World Liberty Financial.On Friday, Republican Representative John Moolenaar, who chairs the House Select Committee on China, expressed concern about ByteDance's ongoing involvement in TikTok's US operations.\"Does this deal ensure China does not have influence over the algorithm? Can the parties involved assure Americans their data is secure?\" he said in a statement. \"Those are questions that need to be answered as the Select Committee does oversight of this deal.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoDearbail JordanandPatrick JacksonWatch: Firefighters battle blazes in Kyiv and Kharkiv after Russian strikesThe first three-way peace talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US have ended in Abu Dhabi with no apparent breakthrough, as fighting rages.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky raised the possibility of a second meeting as early as next week, while an American official said a new round would begin on 1 February.The two-day talks ended after waves of Russian air strikes targeted Ukraine's badly damaged energy infrastructure, killing one person and injuring 35 others, Ukrainian officials said. Russia accused Ukraine of attacking an ambulance in Ukrainian territory under its control, killing three medics. Later, it reported a Ukrainian missile attack on energy infrastructure in Belgorod.The BBC could not independently verify the reports.The talks in Abu Dhabi were the first trilateral meeting since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour in 2022.\"The central focus of the discussions was the possible parameters for ending the war,\" Zelensky posted on X.\"I highly value the understanding of the need for American monitoring and oversight of the process of ending the war and ensuring genuine security.\"All sides had agreed to \"report back to their capitals\" and co-ordinate further steps with their leaders, he added.\"We've agreed that the next round begins next Sunday in Abu Dhabi again,\" an unnamed US official told reporters.The decision to hold further talks was a \"good sign\" and and \"a lot of work\" had been done over the two days of negotiations, the official added.The Russian state news agency Ria-Novosti reported that Moscow remained open to a continuation of dialogue with Ukraine and the US.Vitali Klitschko, mayor of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, said one person had died and four had been wounded by Russian air strikes on Friday night, while the mayor of the city of Kharkiv reported that 31 people had been hurt there.Kyiv's critical infrastructure was damaged, Klitschko said, leaving 6,000 buildings without heating.Temperatures have fallen to around -12C in parts of Ukraine. Zelensky said for his part that \"the main target of the Russians\" had been the energy infrastructure.In Kharkiv, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said a maternity hospital and a hostel for displaced people had been damaged.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said the \"brutal\" Russian attack - \"cynically\" ordered by President Vladimir Putin - had \"hit not only our people, but also the negotiation table\".He said the \"barbaric\" overnight assault proved \"that Putin's place is not at the board of peace, but at the dock of the special tribunal\".Meanwhile, Russia accused Ukraine of a \"barbaric crime against the civilian population\" of Kherson region, which is partially under Russian control.  Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said a clearly marked ambulance carrying a medical team from the Oleshky central district hospital had been attacked by a Ukrainian drone at the entrance to the village of Hola Prystan.All three medics inside were killed, she said. \"We emphasise that attacks on civilian medical transport are prohibited by international humanitarian law,\" she added.On Saturday evening, the governor of Belgorod, Vyacheslav Gladkov, reported that Ukraine had launched its biggest bombardment yet on the city, which lies across the border from Kharkiv. Energy infrastructure was damaged, Gladkov said, but no casualties were caused.ReutersTalks between Ukraine, Russia and the US are being hosted by the United Arab EmiratesUS President Donald Trump said last week that Putin had accepted an invitation to join his Board of Peace - an organisation focused on ending global conflicts. Putin has not confirmed this. Russia occupies roughly 20% of Ukraine, including parts of the eastern Donbas region. The Kremlin wants Ukraine to hand over large areas of the territory, but Ukraine has ruled this out.In Davos, Zelensky said: \"It's all about the land. This is the issue which is not solved yet.\"He said that he had reached an agreement with Trump on future US security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a deal.He gave no detail but said it would need to go before US Congress and the Ukrainian parliament before signing.Global News Podcast: Can Ukraine get peace without losing land?The day before the talks in Abu Dhabi began, US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner met Putin in Moscow. After the four-hour meeting, Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov said: \"Vladimir Putin has emphasised Russia's sincere commitment to settling the Ukraine crisis by political and diplomatic means.\"But he said \"bringing about a lasting settlement would be unlikely without addressing the territorial issue based on the formula as agreed in Anchorage\".Last August, Trump and Putin met in Anchorage, Alaska to discuss ending the war, resulting in an agreement to allow Russia to take the Donbas region and keep control of the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014.Zelensky ruled out giving up the Donbas which is made up of Luhansk and Donetsk and is mostly occupied by Russia.",

    "body": "Four attacks in 48 hours: How east Australia's beaches became a 'perfect storm' for sharks20 hours agoGavin ButlerGetty ImagesThere are manifold reasons why recorded shark encounters are rising in Australia's oceans - but fatalities are relatively rareIt's \"extraordinary\", says shark researcher Chris Pepin-Neff: four shark bites within 48 hours, and three of them within a 15km (9-mile) stretch of Australia's east coast.On 18 January, a 12-year-old boy was taken to hospital with critical injuries and later died after being attacked while swimming in Sydney Harbour. The next day, an 11-year-old's surfboard was bitten at Dee Why beach, hours before a man was attacked at nearby Manly and taken to hospital in critical condition.Then, on 20 January, a fourth surfer \"sustained a wound to his chest\" after a shark bit his board some 300km up the coast.\"This is the closest - in both proximity and in time - series of shark bites that I've ever seen in my 20 years of research,\" says Pepin-Neff, who is an associate professor of public policy at the University of Sydney.The succession of incidents caused alarm and dozens of beaches have been closed because of fears of more attacks. Calls for shark culls have gathered momentum.Experts, however, have cautioned against such measures, advocating instead for a greater awareness of shark behaviour and urging a rethink of humans' relationship to these fish.Many factors may have contributed to the recent series of incidents, they say – and the sharks are not the problem.Why suddenly so many shark attacks in Australia?Non-provoked shark attacks are usually precipitated by environmental conditions, attractants in the water, or both.The three recent incidents in Sydney - all of which are thought to have involved bull sharks – followed several days' worth of heavy rain, during which the city's official weather station recorded 127mm of downpour within 24 hours – its wettest January day in 38 years.That rainfall would have created \"perfect conditions\" for bull sharks, according to Rebecca Olive, senior research fellow at RMIT University.\"Bull sharks thrive in warm, brackish water, which most other sharks flee,\" she told the BBC. \"They love river mouths and estuaries, so the freshwater that flooded off the land following the recent rain events was perfect for them.\"Olive and other experts further note that this freshwater would have likely flushed sewage and nutrients into the sea, thus drawing in bait fish and, in turn, sharks.\"There's clearly an attractant in the water,\" Pepin-Neff says, suggesting that a \"perfect storm\" of low salinity freshwater could have created a \"biodiversity explosion\".\"The bait fish come to the surface, the bull sharks come to the surface, everybody's in the near shore area – and now we have a problem.\"Are shark attacks increasing overall?Official statistics show that shark bite incidents in Australia have gradually increased over the past 30 years – rising from around eight to 10 per year in the 1990s, to yearly averages in the mid-20s from the 2010s onwards.That doesn't mean sharks are becoming more aggressive, though. More likely is that the higher numbers reflect better data collection, as well as a number of compounding human factors.These include a growing coastal population, an increased uptake of water sports and thicker wetsuits that allow swimmers to stay in the ocean for longer.\"The number of total encounters is definitely much higher than it was, just because the population of people who go in the water and do all these things is really high,\" Pepin-Neff explains.They also point out, however, that the rate of shark bites \"doesn't tick up at the amount it should for the proportion of people who are going in the water and doing more things\".Getty ImagesDozens of beaches were closed amid the recent spate of attacks on Australia's east coastOlive echoes this point, noting that \"given how many people use the ocean each day, incidents and attacks are relatively uncommon, and fatalities are even less common\".If it seems as though sharks are becoming more prolific or dangerous, Olive suggests this may just be a result of them being more visible to members of the community – whether because of better reporting systems, the proliferation of drone footage or the outsized attention that shark encounters receive from the media.Pepin-Neff adds that broad, imprecise language around encounters is likely fuelling fears and distorting people's understanding of the risk.When shark sightings, encounters and bites all get conflated under the catchall umbrella of an \"attack\", the danger seems greater than it is.\"There is a problem in being able to meaningfully describe what happened without using the words 'shark attack',\" they explain. \"And that creates a more emotional community experience that is slightly different to what actually happened.\"Do shark culls work?In the wake of Sydney's recent flurry of shark attacks, heightened fears have reinvigorated calls for a cull. Typically, this would involve using nets or baited drumlines to catch and kill sharks near popular beaches.Experts reject the suggestion.\"I can understand when there are calls for culls in response [to an attack]... but I'm strongly opposed to culling sharks in order that we can maintain an illusion of safety while surfing or swimming in the ocean,\" says Olive.Pepin-Neff, meanwhile, stresses that scientific research does not support shark culls as an effective method of reducing the danger of an attack.\"It just doesn't work,\" they say. \"It makes politicians feel better, and it makes activists feel better, and it makes nobody in the water any safer.\"In cases of shark encounters, they add, the variable is not the sharks themselves, but rather the attractant that's drawing them to the area.\"It doesn't matter if you kill all the sharks in Sydney Harbor – if there's a shark up the coast and the attractant is still in the water, then the shark's going to come in.\"How can people avoid shark attacks?Both Olive and Pepin-Neff suggest that the best way to minimise risk is to be more conscious and wary of the factors that exacerbate the likelihood of a shark encounter. On an individual level, this might mean avoiding swimming and surfing after heavy rain. For councils it might mean creating more shark enclosures where people can swim safely.More broadly, however, they emphasise the need for beach-goers to adopt a less idyllic and more pragmatic attitude towards the ocean.\"In Australia we've got to treat the beach like the bush,\" says Pepin-Neff. \"Australians know how to navigate the wild. We just need to reinforce that the ocean is still the wild.\"This will require a rethink not only of our relationship with the water, they add, but also our relationship with sharks.\"This idea that the ocean is always safe but the sharks are always dangerous – it's the opposite,\" they say. \"The ocean is never safe, and the sharks are not always dangerous.\"We're in the way, not on the menu.\"",

    "body": "Blackouts and emergency aid: Why the Cuban Revolution faces its biggest threat yet3 hours agoWill GrantMexico, Central America and Cuba CorrespondentBBCA sizeable exhibit in the Museum of the Revolution in Havana is dedicated to conditions in Cuba before the revolution took power in 1959. Inside the ornate former presidential palace, photographs and oral testimony detail the grinding poverty and ingrained corruption of the dictatorship of Cuba's then-military strongman, Fulgencio Batista.The enduring image is of a woman in a dirt-floored palm-leaf hut cooking with firewood. Similar pictures appear in state museums across the island from the Bay of Pigs to Birán, the birthplace of the father of the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro. The inference is clear: the revolutionaries saved Cubans from the ignorance and hardship of life under a Washington-backed de facto leader and led them to dignity, education and true independence.Yet today, Lisandra Botey identifies more with the impoverished woman in the photograph than with the revolutionaries who liberated her country from Batista.\"We're living like that now, we're exactly like that\", says housewife Lisandra outside her home in Havana, which is cobbled together with pieces of sheet metal and wood.\"Every morning, we have to go down to the beach [in Havana] and look for firewood. Then we bring it home to cook breakfast with – because if we get power, it comes on during school hours.\"Lisandra says she identifies with the impoverished woman in the photograph from pre-revolution CubaLisandra's nine-year-old daughter set off for school that morning with nothing in her stomach, she explains, tears pricking her eyes. Her husband, Brenei Hernández – a construction worker with next to no work – says they often have no idea where the next meal is coming from.\"Every day is the same hunger, the same misery\", he says, stirring a pot of white rice – so at the very least his daughter will come home from school to something hot to eat.With the Cuban economy in freefall since the coronavirus pandemic, no gas has been delivered to Brenei's flimsy home in a Havana suburb for months. He and his neighbours were already cooking with firewood and charcoal before US troops forcibly removed Cuba's closest ally, the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, from power on 3 January. Since then, though, Washington has seemingly taken full control of Venezuela's oil industry and the supply of crude to the communist-run island has dried up.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesBy 1958, the revolution had spread throughout Cuba, culminating in the fall of Havana in early 1959The decades-long US economic embargo on Cuba has been ramped up like never before: US President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs on any nation which sends oil to the stricken island.None of Cuba's traditional allies – whether Mexico, Russia, China, Vietnam or Iran – have stepped up to fill the void left by Venezuela, although the US Treasury this week said it would relax restrictions on a limited number of oil sales, to \"support the Cuban people for commercial and humanitarian use.\"The move comes amid rising tensions between Washington and Havana. Cuba's government has reported that its border guards fatally shot four people travelling in a US‑registered speedboat. It said the individuals were Cuban nationals living in the United States.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US was investigating the \"highly unusual\" incident.\"Washington's old playbook on Cuba doesn't apply anymore and whoever hasn't appreciated that yet is in for a shock,\" says Cuban economist, Ricardo Torres. \"Trump is changing the rules of the game.\"Trump has declared that \"Cuba is ready to fall\", intensifying pressure on the island at its most vulnerable moment since the Cold War. Some commentators have said one of the aims of Washington's removal of Maduro in Venezuela was to deepen Cuba's economic crisis. It appears the Trump administration hopes to weaken the revolution – possibly terminally – and push for the collapse of state-run socialism on the island.The underlying calculation is straightforward: that a worsening internal crisis could create the conditions for the Cuban Revolution to unravel from within. What remains far less certain is whether such a strategy will force regime change, or whether the communist-run Cuban government will, as it has in past crises, find new ways to endure.Blackouts and 'extreme rationing'The effects of the fuel crisis are being felt the length and breadth of Cuba.Blackouts in Havana can last for 15 hours a day or more. Hospitals are in darkness with only emergency cases being admitted. Schools are often shuttered. Rubbish is piled high on street corners with no fuel for the state's garbage trucks to collect it. Scrawny and elderly residents can often be found sifting through the discarded waste.Watch: BBC examines life in Cuba without electricity and gasolineFor an island proud of the social safety net it built for its people since 1959 – universal healthcare, the eradication of illiteracy, tackling infant mortality rates and preventable diseases – the picture is bleak, and getting worse.One constant question since Maduro's arrest is: how long can Cuba hold on without new fuel supplies reaching the island?\"Perhaps the oil inventories could last for six to eight weeks,\" suggests Ricardo Torres – but he admits it's hard to know with any degree of precision. \"Cuba doesn't publish figures on fuel inventories.\"\"Extreme rationing\" could be introduced, he says, but draconian restrictions are already in place. People are limited to 20 litres of fuel at the petrol pumps, which must be paid for in US dollars.They're obliged to use a government-run app called Ticket. But the wait can last for days, even weeks. Drivers are finding more than 10,000 people ahead of them when they join the virtual queue for half a tank of petrol. Unsurprisingly in such circumstances, the price of black-market fuel has skyrocketed.AFP via Getty ImagesThere is a limit of 20 litres of fuel at the petrol pumps, which must be paid for in US dollarsDespite it all, Brenei Hernández doesn't direct his ire at Washington. Quite the opposite, in fact: he blames the Cuban state.\"I'd like Trump to take this place over. Then let's see if things get better,\" he says with unerring honesty. \"What can I tell you? I'm not going to lie,\" he adds.Regime changeHaving spent years listening to Cubans repeat anodyne revolutionary slogans when asked for their opinions on camera, it's disarming to hear such frank views expressed with no outward fear of the repercussions. Such is the level of disgust and exhaustion, the public's fear of reprisals for speaking out is beginning to evaporate.\"It's too much,\" Brenei says. \"We're only eating white rice. Hopefully I can get enough money together in the next couple of days for a packet of hot dogs, or three or four eggs.\"Lisandra already worries that her daughter will want a birthday cake this year, which is well beyond their means.\"Every day is the same hunger, the same misery,\" says Brenei HernándezSuch suffering may be part of the Trump administration's strategy of \"maximum pressure\" on Cuba. But while the methodology may be new, says Ricardo Torres, Washington's ultimate goal in Cuba remains the same as always: regime change.\"Whether the change in Cuba is something very sudden or a negotiated solution, in the end, it's regime change that Trump wants.\"The issue for Cubans is how Washington intends to make that change happen, Torres adds, with more acute pain from the oil shutout on the horizon.The Cuban government has repeatedly described the policy as inhumane, cruel and illegal under international law: \"What right does a world power have to deny fuel and the ability to function to a smaller nation?\" said Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel.It's all a far cry from the optimism of Washington's Cuba policy of a decade ago. After decades of enmity, in 2014 President Barack Obama opted to re-establish ties with the island in a historic but short-lived thaw. Hardliners in the Cuban government warned that Obama's overtures amounted to the same aim of regime change dressed up in nicer clothing. For the ordinary Cubans who lived through it, though, the diplomatic reset felt like the polar opposite of the current Trump approach.AFP via Getty ImagesIn 2014 President Barack Obama opted to re-establish ties with CubaNext month marks the tenth anniversary of Obama's visit to Havana as the first sitting US president to step foot on the island in almost a century.In front of the Cuban leader, Raúl Castro, he delivered an extraordinary address – broadcast live on state television – in which he said he had come to \"bury the last remnant of the Cold War in the Americas\" and \"extend the hand of friendship to the Cuban people\".The man who oversaw the diplomatic thaw was the then-US ambassador to Cuba, Jeffrey DeLaurentis. I asked him whether the Cuban Revolution was now facing an existential threat.\"That will depend upon what some other countries might do\", DeLaurentis replied.Venezuela's oil support was worth some 35,000 barrels of crude a day to Cuba. There have been some broad indications that Russia might send oil to the island and the Cuban foreign minister, Bruno Rodríguez, was recently in Moscow for talks with his Russian counterpart and with Russian President Vladimir Putin. So far, though, no Russian fuel tankers have docked in Cuban ports.Rodríguez also travelled to China, Vietnam and Spain trying to drum up support.Getty ImagesUS troops forcibly removed Cuba's closest ally, the Venezuelan president, Maduro, from power on 3 January\"The rush to defend and help has certainly not been as enthusiastic and as significant as we've seen in the past. But there's still a chance that other countries might take some action,\" says DeLaurentis.As to what Trump specifically wants in Cuba, the former lead US diplomat on the island says the administration is \"trying to take coercive steps to bring the government to the table or capitulate but not necessarily collapse\".\"That's a pretty risky strategy it seems to me, with a lot of potential for unintended consequences,\" he adds.Those consequences are already visible in the rapidly worsening humanitarian crisis which prompted Mexico to send tonnes of emergency aid to Cuba, including powdered milk and personal hygiene items. They're already being felt every day by the families forced to cook with firewood and the drivers in urgent need of petrol.Esteban Bello Rodríguez runs several \"almendrones\", 1950s classic American automobiles, in which he ferries tourists around the iconic spots of Havana. His trade has been heavily impacted by the fuel scarcity and the fall in tourism.Esteban Bello Rodríguez's trade has been heavily impacted by the fuel scarcity\"There's a problem here – the fuel problem – so surely the people at the top on both sides have to sit down, figure it out,\" he says bluntly. \"All I know is that a solution must be found because this is affecting the entire country – the people, nationwide. All of us.\"The real powerOn the US side, Cuba policy is largely being led by the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio – a Cuban-American son of exiles and former Florida senator.Trump says Rubio is talking to the top tier of the Cuban government and for days there's been widespread speculation over who might lead that negotiation on the Cuban side. Cuban economist Ricardo Torres says that the only dealmaker on the island is Raúl Castro, even at the revolutionary leader's advanced age of 94.AFP via Getty ImagesTrump says Marco Rubio is talking to the top tier of the Cuban government \"The only people with capacity to engage in a meaningful negotiation are people close to Raúl. The civilian government doesn't have any real power – including President Miguel Díaz-Canel\", he argues.\"The real power in Cuba is Raúl and the closed circle around him.\"Last week, the Axios news outlet reported that his grandson, Raúl Rodríguez Castro – commonly known in Cuba as \"El Cangrejo\", meaning The Crab – is the Trump administration's point of contact inside Castro's inner circle. If so, he's considered one of his grandfather's most trusted confidantes, having been his personal bodyguard, and more business-orientated than ideological, with no high-level diplomatic experience. Neither side, especially not the Cubans, have confirmed he's in talks with Rubio.\"In the case of Venezuela, the Trump administration has been very pragmatic,\" adds Torres.Rubio has seemingly been happy to deal with an interim government in Caracas under Delcy Rodríguez and Washington appears to be looking to persuade the conservative Cuban-American lobby in Florida of the benefits of negotiating with a similarly defenestrated regime in Havana.However, despite the public adherence to the \"maximum pressure\" strategy, Washington does seem to fear that total political change overnight in Venezuela or Cuba would be profoundly destabilising and could prompt a migration crisis as well as humanitarian one.AFP via Getty ImagesRubbish is often left uncollected on street cornersSeveral Cuba watchers have noted that Rubio's tone towards the island was markedly softer in recent comments he made at the Munich Security Conference, with an emphasis on economic reforms rather than a root-and-branch political transformation.\"In a way it almost sounded like a strange variant of Obama 2.0 in terms of economic reforms and so forth,\" said former ambassador DeLaurentis. \"That signalled to me that they are looking for a Delcy-like figure to negotiate with.\"\"Ten to 20 years ago, the diaspora in south Florida would have been completely opposed to that kind of approach. But I guess that now they'd give the president and the secretary the benefit of the doubt, and allow this sort of scenario to play out,\" adds DeLaurentis.Meanwhile, any visitor wanting to see the photograph of the pre-revolutionary woman cooking with firewood will have to wait. The museum has been closed for over a year for refurbishments and now there's no fuel to continue the work.In what is now the most challenging time in the island's modern history, it's not yet clear if only the Museum of the Revolution will be undergoing a renovation this year – or the Cuban Revolution itself.Top picture credit: AFP via Getty ImagesMore from InDepthBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "First writing may be 40,000 years earlier than thought20 hours agoGeorgina RannardScience reporterUniversity of Tübingen / Hildegard JensenA 40,000-year-old mammoth figurine with engraved rows of crosses and dotsThe history of writing down thoughts and feelings could be tens of thousands of years older than previously believed, surprising archaeologists who made the discovery.The researchers discerned patterns of meaning in lines, notches, dots, and crosses on objects like mammoth tusks as old as 45,000 years in caves in Germany.Traditionally historians date the first written words to proto-cuneiform scripts made around 5,000 years ago in ancient Iraq, or Mesopotamia.The precise meaning of the symbols in Germany remains a mystery.The objects are from just before Homo sapiens moved to Europe from Africa where they interacted with Neanderthals.Until now it was thought that writing developed in Mesopotamia around 3,000 BCE, followed by hieroglyphics in Egypt and later in China and Mesoamerica.\"The Stone Age sign sequences are an early alternative to writing,\" says Prof Christian Bentz from Saarland University, an author of the new research.The work suggests that Stone Age people were as clever as modern-day humans, according to researcher Ewa Dutkiewicz from Berlin's Museum of Prehistory and Early History.\"So far, we've only scratched the surface of what can be found in terms of symbol sequences on a wide variety of artifacts,\" she says.The team analysed more than 3,000 characters on 260 objects to uncover what they call the DNA of writing.Some of the objects are from a 37-km long cave system called the Lonetal in Baden-Württemberg, southern Germany.Landesmuseum Württemberg / Hendrik ZwietaschThe so-called \"adorant\" has a human-like figure and several rows of notches and dots. On a small mammoth carved from tusk, the researchers analysed carefully engraved rows of crosses and dots.And on an artefact called \"adorant\" from the Geißenklösterle cave in the Achtal valley, they identified rows of dots and notches on an ivory plaque showing a lion-human creature.They believe the arrangement of the marks, in particular the dots on the back, show the patterns acted as communication.The researchers believe that Stone Age people deliberately carved these symbols to communicate messages, meaning, and convey thoughts.Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Vorderasiatisches Museum / Olaf M. TesmerA proto-cuneiform tablet from around 3350 years ago \"Our results also show that the hunter-gatherers of the Paleolithic era developed a symbol system with a statistically comparable information density to the earliest proto-cuneiform tablets from ancient Mesopotamia – a full 40,000 years later,\" says Bentz.The clue to finding meaning is in the density of the symbols. They found high repetition of the signs and predictability in the subsequent symbols that is \"comparable to much later proto-cuneiform,\" according to Bentz.They found denser patterns on figurines than on tools.The team say that it shows that communicating information was very important for Paleolithic people.\"They were skilled craftspeople. You can tell they carried the objects with them. Many of them fit very well in the hand, just the right size to fit in the palm,\" says Dutkiewicz.The research is published in the journal PNAS.",

    "body": "4 hours agoYvette TanGetty ImagesSince coming to power, Xi has launched waves of anti-corruption drivesChina has removed 19 officials, including nine from the military, from its list of lawmakers ahead of its biggest annual political meeting next week.The removals were announced by the country's top legislative body, the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee. No official reason for the removal has been given, but it comes just weeks after President Xi Jinping removed Zhang Youxia, his highest-ranking general and also one of his closest military allies, from his role. Since coming to power, Xi has launched waves of anti-corruption drives, calling corruption \"the biggest threat\" to the Communist Party. However, some critics say it has been used as a tool to purge political rivals.According to a report by state media outlets, those removed include Li Qiaoming, commander of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Ground Force and Shen Jinlong, a former PLA Navy commander. Also on the list were several other military officers and a number of provincial officials including Sun Shaochong, the former party chief of the Inner Mongolia region. It comes just weeks after Zhang was removed from his post, after he was accused of \"serious violations of discipline and law\" - typically a euphemism for corruption.But it is also the latest in a series of purges of high-profile figures in the military over the last few years, including a October 2025 crackdown which saw nine top generals removed from their posts. Authorities at the time said the purges were part of an anti-corruption drive. Xi has made the fight against corruption a central pillar of his rule beginning with his \"tigers and flies\" anti-corruption drive targeting both high-level and low-level officials, launched shortly after he took power in 2013. He has said recently that the battle \"remains grave and complex\".Thousands of delegates are due to descend on the capital Beijing next week for the Two Sessions. These are- the annual meetings of the NPC, which is China's legislature, and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference which is the country's top political advisory body.The Two Sessions will run from March 4 to 11 and will see the government announce its five year plan, where it outlines its key policy objectives, and its annual economic targets.

    "body": "18 hours agoPaulin KolaEPATrump's plans to seize control of Greenland have dominated Danish politicsDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has announced early elections - hailing the next four years as \"decisive\" for her country.\"We as Danes and as Europeans will really have to stand on our own feet,\" Frederiksen told parliament. \"We need to define our relationship with the United States,\" she added. The past few months of Danish politics have been dominated by US President Donald Trump's threats to annex Greenland - a semi-autonomous Danish territory. Last month, Trump dropped threats to use force against the fellow Nato ally to seize the Arctic island he argues is necessary to defend against possible attacks from Russia and China.Announcing the decision to call early elections on 24 March, Prime Minister Frederiksen told parliament that security \"is and will remain the very foundation of Danish politics for many, many years to come\". \"We must rearm to ensure peace on our continent,\" she said. \"We must stick together in Europe, and we must secure the future of the Danish Commonwealth\" - Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands.\"Whether I will continue to be your prime minister depends on how strong a mandate you give the Social Democrats,\" Frederiksen said mentioning her party, the lead partner in the current Danish coalition. Trump has claimed without evidence that it is \"covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place\". More than 100 US military personnel are permanently stationed at a US base in Greenland's north-western tip - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two.Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.But Trump has not abandoned his plans - he has said previously that the US needs to own Greenland to properly defend it - and talks continue over ways of establishing US control over the entire island. Both Denmark and Greenland have said they will not agree to cede sovereignty to the US. Their European allies have rallied to their support.The latest confrontation may come in the next few days if Trump follows through with an announcement that the US plans to send a boat filled with medical supplies to Greenland, alleging \"many people\" on the island are sick and \"not being taken care of\". Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen rejected the proposal, telling Trump that Greenland provides free healthcare for all citizens, unlike the US.",

    "body": "8 hours agoLucy HookerandKali Hays,Technology reporterBloomberg via Getty ImagesJack Dorsey co-founded TwitterTwitter co-founder Jack Dorsey says his technology firm Block is laying off almost half its workforce because artificial intelligence (AI) \"fundamentally changes what it means to build and run a company.\"\"Within the next year, I believe the majority of companies will reach the same conclusion and make similar structural changes,\" he wrote in a letter to shareholders.The layoffs will mean headcount at the company - which owns Square, CashApp and Tidal - will fall to less than 6,000 from 10,000.Block has seen several rounds of layoffs since 2024 but this is the first time it has cited AI as the reason for redundancies and marks the latest in a series of major job cuts in the tech industry.In a subsequent call discussing financial results, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, said the company was looking at cost reductions elsewhere as it ramps up AI spending. Meta, Microsoft and Google have also laid off workers as their focus has shifted to huge investments in AI.Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's co-founder and chief executive, said he is expecting \"2026 to be the year that AI dramatically changes the way we work.\"\"We're starting to see projects that used to take big teams now be accomplished by a single, very talented person,\" Zuckerberg said.Most tech companies today are using AI tools that automatically write the computer code required to operate software or websites, like Claude Code from Anthropic or Codex from OpenAI. But some analysts have suggested the immediate threat to jobs has been exaggerated by executives who want to appear ahead of the curve.According to Dorsey, only more change related to AI capabilities is on the way.\"I don't think we're early to this realisation,\" he said Thursday. \"I think most companies are late\". Block's financial report showed strong demand for its products and services, pushing up profits at the end of last year.The firm also said it will incur up to $500m (£370m) in restructuring costs as it pivots to the new strategy.Its shares rose by more than 20% in extended trading after the announcement.Dorsey is a co-founder and former chief executive of Twitter, the online micro-messaging platform that was later bought by Elon Musk and renamed X.",

    "body": "16 hours agoPaulin KolaReutersParty co-leader Alice Weidel described the interim ruling as a 'major victory'A German court has issued a temporary injunction stopping the country's domestic intelligence service from referring to the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party as a \"right-wing extremist\" group.The far-right party had challenged the classification announced by German intelligence last May, and the court in Cologne issued an injunction on the use of the term until it has issued a ruling over it. The party's co-leader Alice Weidel said the verdict was \"a major victory not only for the AfD but also for democracy and the rule of law\".The AfD came second in federal elections in Germany last year, winning a record 152 seats in the 630-seat parliament with 20.8% of the vote.A designation as an extremist group gives authorities greater surveillance powers and, in fact, the AfD had already been placed under observation for suspected extremism in Germany. The intelligence agency had also classed it as right-wing extremist in three states in the east, where its popularity is highest.The AfD challenged the label in Cologne - where the BfV is based - which is why Thursday's decision was issued by the city's administrative court.It did not say when its final ruling would be issued.As part of its role in ensuring Germany's \"free democratic basic order\", the domestic intelligence agency is responsible for both counter-intelligence and investigating terror threats. Germany's Constitutional Court has banned only two parties since the end of World War Two, both in the 1950s.",

    "body": "18 hours agoBen HattonReutersThe president and CEO of the World Economic Forum (WEF), Borge Brende, has resigned after a review into his links to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The forum ordered an independent review into Brende over his ties to the disgraced financier following the release of Epstein files by the US Department of Justice.Brende has acknowledged he dined with Epstein three times between 2018 and 2019 and communicated with him by email and text, but said he was \"completely unaware\" of his past criminal activity.The WEF said a review into his links to Epstein found \"there were no additional concerns beyond what has been previously disclosed\".Brende, a former Norwegian foreign minister, has also said he regretted not having investigated Epstein more thoroughly.The WEF holds an annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, which attracts political and business leaders from across the world.In a statement on Thursday, Brende said he had decided to step down after more than eight years in the role following \"careful consideration\". \"I believe now is the right moment for the Forum to continue its important work without distractions,\" he said.Epstein was convicted for soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008, for which he was registered as a sex offender.Being named in the Epstein files does not indicate criminality and Brende has not been accused of wrongdoing.WEF co-chairs Andre Hoffmann and Larry Fink thanked Brende for his \"significant contributions\" and said they respected his decision.Alois Zwinggi will serve as interim president and CEO while the organisation's board of trustees oversees a process to identify a permanent successor, the WEF said. Zwinggi had been a managing director on the WEF's executive body. A number of politicians, celebrities, business leaders and royals from across the world have faced scrutiny over their links to Epstein following the release of the latest tranche of files linked to US investigations into Epstein. The files contain millions of private emails, images and FBI reports into Epstein, who died in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking.Former Norwegian Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland was charged with \"gross corruption\" earlier this month over his ties with Epstein, police said.",

    "body": "13 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorAnadolu via Getty ImagesEuropean Commissioner for Equality Hadja Lahbib said almost half a million unsafe abortions took place in Europe every yearThe European Commission has told member states they can use existing EU funding to pay for safe abortions, after a citizens' initiative attracted 1.1 million signatures to help women without access to safe and legal terminations.The My Voice, My Choice group behind the initiative has hailed the decision as a victory for women in Europe and a political commitment to women's rights.But the Commission stopped short of creating any new funding facility to enable women in areas of Europe that do not provide abortions to travel to parts that do.Health policy in the EU is a national competence, but by proposing the existing \"European Social Fund Plus\" the Commission says each member state can decide how they use it.European Commissioner for Equality Hadja Lahbib said on Thursday that almost 500,000 unsafe abortions took place in Europe every year and \"safety and freedom must never depend on your postcode and income\".Abortion is legal in most EU countries, but some states such as Malta and Poland have almost complete bans and in Italy, where abortion has been legal since 1978, access to safe termination varies from one region to another.That means that women often travel within their own country or to another EU member state to secure safe abortions.Although campaigners acknowledged that no new legal instrument had been created to fund safe abortions, My Voice, My Choice co-ordinator Nika Kovač said the Commission had outlined a \"concrete pathway\" for future care.Anti-abortion groups were critical of the move, arguing it went against Christian values.The Dutch Reformed party SGP said it was disappointed, and MEP Bert-Jan Ruissen adding that it was sad the Commission had been swayed by the \"massive campaign and lobbying\" of My Voice, My Choice.Polish legal advocacy group Ordo Iuris cast doubt on the organisations behind My Voice My Choice, and said many had received EU funding.The Commission said that the fund had not been used for safe abortions but it was already in place and did not need to wait for future budget negotiations.In theory a woman who travels to one member state for a termination could have her transport, accommodation, costs and scans paid for by the country involved with money from the existing fund. The same could also apply for a woman in a rural area needing to travel to another region in her own country.Nika Kovač called on the Commission to provide member states with clear instructions on how they could use the EU funds.European Citizens' Initiatives were brought in by the EU 14 years ago to urge the EU's executive body, the Commission, to come up with legal action if campaigners can summon a million signatures in at least seven countries.",

    "body": "4 hours agoBrandon DrenonGettyThe FBI has fired roughly 10 members, all of whom participated in a probe into Donald Trump's handling of classified documents after his first term.Their termination on Wednesday, confirmed by the BBC's US partner CBS, was announced shortly after FBI director Kash Patel told Reuters that federal agents subpoenaed his phone records when he was a private citizen during the documents investigation. Susie Wiles, now White House chief of staff, also had her phone records subpoenaed  when she was a private citizen as part of the investigation.Patel did not offer any evidence of wrongdoing by the FBI employees who were fired.After Trump left the White House in 2021, Special Counsel Jack Smith led two federal investigations into now-President Trump. One case was focused on whether Trump tried to overturn the 2020 election results. The other involved classified documents Trump brought back to his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida and his alleged efforts to obstruct the US Department of Justice from later retrieving them. The FBI staffers who were terminated on Wednesday all participated in the classified documents case.The BBC has reached out to the FBI for comment. An advocacy group representing current and former FBI employees condemned the firings. \"These actions weaken the Bureau by stripping away critical expertise and destabilizing the workforce, undermining trust in leadership and jeopardizing the Bureau's ability to meet its recruitment goals - ultimately putting the nation at greater risk,\" the FBI Agents Association said in a statement. Trump and two of his associates were indicted in 2023, following Smith's investigation into the classified documents.In 2024, a federal judge in Florida dropped the case against Trump, however, having found that Smith was unlawfully appointed. This year, a federal appeals court in Georgia dropped the case against the last two defendants at the request of Trump's justice department.Since Trump returned to the White House in January, the justice department and FBI have fired employees who participated in the federal investigations against him.The justice department also attempted to pursue charges against former FBI director James Comey, whom Trump fired during his first term in 2017, and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led a civil fraud lawsuit against Trump.",

    "body": "4 hours agoDanielle Kaye,Business reporterandNardine Saad,Los Angeles, California Getty ImagesNetflix has backed away from its proposal to buy Warner Bros Discovery, clearing the way for Paramount Skydance to win a months-long battle for one of Hollywood's most storied studios in a deal worth around $111bn (£82.2bn).Warner Bros, which put itself up for sale last year, on Thursday said Paramount's latest bid was \"superior\" to the one from Netflix, which in turn refused to raise its offer.Netflix executives say they have declined to match Paramount's bid as \"the deal is no longer financially attractive\" at that price.The buyer would gain control of the iconic studio along with its films and media networks - a takeover that could significantly reshape the media landscape.Last December, Warner Bros agreed to a takeover offer from Netflix for some of its assets, in a deal worth roughly $82bn (£61bn) including debt.Paramount then made a rival proposal, which was rebuffed by Warner Bros, but an increased offer was made earlier this week, boosted by $1 per share.\"The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,\" Netflix co-chief executives Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a statement. \"However, we've always been disciplined.\"\"This transaction was always a 'nice to have' at the right price, not a 'must have' at any price,\" the Netflix executives added.The announcement came just hours after Sarandos had visited the White House on Thursday.It caps off a dramatic months-long saga that - if approved by regulators - is likely to reshape Hollywood.But California Attorney General Rob Bonta said later on Thursday that the potential merger \"is not a done deal\".\"These two Hollywood titans have not cleared regulatory scrutiny - the California Department of Justice has an open investigation, and we intend to be vigorous in our review,\" he wrote in a social media post.Bonta had said earlier this month that his office would review any deal involving Warner Bros as the entertainment industry represents a \"critical sector\" for California's economy.Paramount would also need approval from the US Department of Justice as well as European regulators.A deal between Paramount and Warner Bros could hold serious ramifications for the future of one of the US's biggest news brands - CNN. Warner Bros is the network's parent company.Paramount, which is looking to transform itself into a Hollywood heavyweight, is backed by tech billionaire Larry Ellison and led by his son David.The funding of Paramount's offer has drawn scrutiny, in part over the close ties between US President Donald Trump and Larry Ellison, a major Republican donor.Trump has frequently attacked the news network over its reporting of his policies. He said in December that he believed CNN should be sold as part of any Warner Bros deal. He called the people running CNN \"corrupt or incompetent\" and said they should not be entrusted to run the network.CNN head Mark Thompson sent an email to employees as news spread of the all-but-assured Paramount deal, telling workers to not \"jump to conclusions about the future until we know more\", US media reported. The BBC has contacted CNN for comment.Paramount's initial hostile bid was also supported by Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner through his investment firm, raising concerns about the president's influence over the deal.Kushner's firm, Affinity Partners, backed away in December amid scrutiny over the deal.Paramount's 2025 merger with Skydance also led to scrutiny amid negotiations with the Trump administration's Federal Communications Commission, which had to sign off on the deal.Among the concessions made was Paramount's $16m settlement on behalf of CBS News. Trump had sued the network over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with former vice president Kamala Harris, claiming that the network had engaged in election interference in the way the program was edited.The two studio's merger later resulted in leadership shakeups and layoffs at CBS News.On Thursday, chief executive David Ellison welcomed the Warner Bros board's decision in favour of Paramount's sweetened offer. The proposal, he said in a statement, offers Warner Bros shareholders \"superior value, certainty and speed to closing\".If Paramount's deal is approved by regulators, the company would fold Warner Bros' HBO Max streaming customers into its portfolio. It would also take ownership of CNN, the Food Network and a range of sports offerings.Paramount's traditional networks already include brands such as Nickelodeon, CBS and Comedy Central.Getty ImagesParamount Skydance boss David EllisonMany in Hollywood have viewed the bidding war between Netflix and Paramount as a battle with no good winner.Critics of a deal with Netflix voiced concern that the storied movie studio would be lost to the Silicon Valley streaming titan, paving the way for the depletion of cinema. But a merger with Paramount, which has touted itself among the last standing movie studios in Hollywood, also left critics unnerved over the company's perceived political connections to the Trump administration - a concern that has also riled the media landscape over the future of CNN. Across the board, the selling of Warner Bros will have massive ramification across Tinsel town, with all but assured cuts to staff in a city that has been marred by continued production cuts.In December, Warner Bros said it had agreed to sell its film and streaming divisions, including HBO, to Netflix in a deal worth $27.75 per share or roughly $82bn (£61bn), including debt.Warner Bros said it would spin-off the remainder of its business, including traditional television networks and the news channel CNN, as an independent company.But in a last-ditch push, Paramount this week agreed to pay more for a Warner Bros takeover. The company offered $31 per share in cash, up from $30 per share to take over the entire company.It also agreed to pay $7bn should the deal fall through and cover the $2.8bn fee Warner Bros had agreed to pay Netflix in the event of a break-up of the merger plan.Additional reporting by Osmond Chia",

Omwamba, aged 33, pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.A total of 1,000 Kenyans have been recruited to fight for Russia in its four-year war against Ukraine, a report from Kenya's National Intelligence Service (NIS), released last week, said.Presenting the report to MPs, parliament majority leader Kimani Ichung'wah, described a \"deeply disturbing\" network of rogue state officials allegedly colluding with human trafficking syndicates to recruit and transport Kenyans.Omwamba was arrested earlier this month in a town near the Ethiopian border after surrendering to police.Victims rescued from the Athi Rivers complex last September revealed they had signed contracts with an unnamed overseas employment agency, committing to pay up to $18,000 (£13,000) for visas, travel, accommodation, and other logistics, the police said.The National Intelligence Service said that upon arrival in Russia, many Kenyans reportedly find themselves deployed to front-line combat roles after minimal military training.Earlier this month, the government of the East African country said it would urge Russia to ban the recruitment of Kenyans to fight in Ukraine.The Russian embassy in Nairobi has denied encouraging Kenyans to fight in Ukraine, or issuing visas \"to Kenyan citizens who sought to travel to Russia with the stated pose of participating in the Special Military Operation (SMO) in Ukraine\".The embassy added that while it does not recruit foreigners, Russian law allows foreign nationals who are legally in Russia to voluntarily enlist in their armed forces.Ukraine's foreign minister said on Wednesday that more than 1,700 people from 36 countries in Africa had been recruited to fight for Russia.South Africa on Thursday said that two of its citizens had been killed in Ukraine, while another 15 had been repatriated over the past week. Two more remain in Russia getting treatment for \"very severe\" injuries, said Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola.Ukrainian officials have repeatedly warned that anyone fighting for Russia will be treated as an enemy combatant, and that the only safe route out is to surrender and be treated as a prisoner of war.However, Ukraine itself has previously come in for criticism for trying to recruit foreign nationals, including Africans, to fight on its side.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "19 hours agoNardine SaadLos AngelesGetty ImagesD4vd has not been charged or officially named as a suspect in the caseNewly unsealed court filings have revealed that US singer D4vd - real name David Anthony Burke - is the target of a grand jury investigation into the apparent murder of a 14-year-old girl, whose remains were found in his car in September.The filings were released after D4vd's family were summoned by a California court to testify before the grand jury.Dawud Burke, D4vd's father, fought against the summons in a Texas court, and in doing so included portions of material from the California case that had not been previously available to the public.The filings confirm that D4vd has been identified as a \"target\" of a grand jury investigation in Los Angeles and that he may be subject to proceedings for one count of murder.He has not been charged or officially named as a suspect in the case and an indictment has not been announced. Grand jury proceedings remain ongoing, according to US media. D4vd has not commented on the case, but his representatives previously said he was cooperating with police.A lawyer for the singer did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.Warning - this story contains content that some may find distressingThe unsealed court filings mark the latest chapter in a case which has been dissected by internet sleuths for months.On 8 September 2025, investigators found the decomposed head and torso of 14-year-old Celeste Rivas Hernandez in a cadaver bag in the front boot of a Tesla car registered to D4vd's address in Texas, the court documents said.When they removed the bag, they discovered severed arms and legs in a black bag, the documents said.D4vd - who released his debut album in April - was on tour when the remains were discovered.Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesCeleste Rivas Hernandez, of Lake Elsinore, California, was reported missing before she was found dead and dismemberedPolice had previously said that they discovered Rivas Hernandez's remains inside the boot of the impounded car after responding to reports of a foul odour at the Hollywood tow yard.Rivas Hernandez, from Lake Elsinore in California, had been missing and was last seen in April 2024, according to a missing person flyer cited by CBS, the BBC's US news partner. The decomposition of her body indicated that she had already been \"deceased for several weeks\", investigators have said.A police spokesperson previously said that the case was being investigated by its robbery-homicide division.As the grand jury proceedings got under way last year, the court filings said that prosecutors believed the testimony of D4vd's family was \"material and necessary\" to the investigation. But Dawud Burke, along with his wife Colleen and son Caleb, have argued that the summons violates their right to due process because the notice they received from the California court contained redacted information, according to Texas court transcripts included in the filings.\"The Court ordered Mr. Burke to travel across the country to appear before a California grand jury without ever allowing him to see the full documents that justified the extraordinary compulsion,\" Dawud Burke's attorney said in the filing.He challenged the California court's out-of-state subpoena, which he believed was compelling him to travel against his will.Los Angeles Police Department detectives travelled to Texas to bring the singer's family to California to appear before the grand jury, whose proceedings are secret, court records said.The related documents have provided the biggest tranche of information about the case thus far, delineating key details in the ongoing investigation, which has been shrouded in secrecy.In November, the Los Angeles County medical examiner's office said it received a court order imposing a security hold on the case, and that no details about Rivas Hernandez's death could be released or posted on its website.The police department said it requested the order to ensure officers \"receive information from the Medical Examiner before the public\".Chief Medical Examiner Dr Odey Ukpo said the practice of security holds is \"virtually unheard of in other counties\" and \"has not been proven to improve outcomes in the legal system\".The Los Angeles District Attorney's Office declined to comment when contacted by the BBC.",

    "body": "Girl, 14, shot dead as South Africa's 'taxi wars' hit school18 hours agoWycliffe MuiaGeach/Gallo Images via Getty Images)South Africa's competitive and lucrative taxi industry has been plagued by violence for years Police in South Africa are investigating a fatal shooting at a secondary school in the coastal city of Cape Town that killed a 14-year-old pupil and a taxi operator.An unidentified man opened fire on a taxi as the driver waited to pick up pupils on Wednesday, shooting the driver, another man and two children, police said. Two pupils, aged 14 and 16, were also injured in the attack, which has been linked to long-running deadly turf wars between rival taxi associations. \"It is unacceptable that our children continue to be exposed to danger as a result of ongoing conflict within the taxi industry,\" said Isaac Sileku, a senior Western Cape official. Violence has plagued South Africa's highly competitive and lucrative taxi industry for decades.While minibus taxis continue to dominate the market, the rise of e-hailing services is increasing tensions, leading to violent and sometimes deadly clashes between operators.On Thursday, Cape Town Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis said the local authority was offering a reward of up to 100,000 rand (£4,600; $6,400) for information that leads to the arrest and prosecution of those responsible for the shooting.Wednesday's attack took place as students at Atlantis Senior Secondary were leaving school, when gunshots rang out and sparked panic.Police arrived at the scene and found a minibus taxi parked outside the school, with the body of a 42-year-old a taxi operator inside. He had multiple gunshot wounds.In the school grounds, officers discovered the body of a 14-year-old girl who had been shot multiple times in the chest. Police said she had been shot while attempting to run from the gunfire.\"A 14-year-old learner [female] sustained a gunshot wound to her back. Another 16-year-old female was grazed by a bullet,\" said police spokesperson FC van Wyk.He said it was not yet clear how many gunmen were involved, adding that detectives and officers from the Taxi Violence Investigations Unit were investigating the attack.This was the second attempt on the taxi operator's life this month, local media reported.In a statement, the Western Cape regional authorities condemned the \"senseless act\", saying \"no learner should ever face danger while travelling to or from school\". \"Violence of this nature undermines community safety, disrupts education, and instils fear among residents,\" it added. Sileku said the safety of commuters and learners \"is non-negotiable and must never be compromised by [taxi] industry conflict\". \"We also urge law enforcement agencies to act decisively to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice swiftly.\"More about South Africa from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Russia and Ukraine exchange more than 1,000 soldiers' bodies18 hours agoPaulin KolaMedinski Instagram postThe peace talks have not produced any results, but prisoners and bodies have been exchangedRussia says it has handed over the remains of 1,000 soldiers to Ukraine and has received the bodies of 35 Russian soldiers in return.It comes as Ukraine's chief negotiator met US President Donald Trump's envoys in Geneva to discuss economic plans for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war.Negotiators were also preparing a third round of US-led talks aimed at ending the conflict which has entered its fifth year - a trilateral meeting involving the Russian side, too. Hours before the Geneva talks, Russia launched 420 drones and 39 missiles in six different regions of Ukraine, injuring dozens of people, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said.Vladimir Medinsky, a top aide of Russian President Vladimir Putin, announced the exchange of bodies in a short announcement on Telegram. He gave no details, but included an image showing bodies being unloaded from a truck. Hours later, Ukraine said it had received 1,000 bodies which, \"according to prior information from the Russian side, may belong to Ukrainian defenders\".The two sides have exchanged thousands of soldiers' bodies over the course of the conflict that began with Putin's decision to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. The exchange is based on an agreement reached by the two sides during negotiations in Istanbul in June 2025. Moscow and Kyiv agreed to return the bodies of up to 6,000 soldiers each, as well as all sick and heavily wounded prisoners of war and those aged under 25.Kyiv and Moscow regularly publish estimates of the other side's losses, but do not detail their own.And from public sources, the BBC has confirmed the names of almost 186,000 people killed fighting on Russia's side in Ukraine. The true death toll is generally accepted to be much higher, as many deaths on the battlefield are not recorded.So even though estimates suggest more Russians are dying every day, Moscow has returned more bodies to Ukraine overall than it has received. No-one has explained the discrepancy, even though Russia has previously accused Ukraine of not abiding by the Istanbul agreement, and Ukraine has alleged Russian body returns were irregular and sometimes included Russians' remains - a charge Moscow has rejected.One possible explanation is that Russia captures more Ukrainian bodies given its troops have been on the attack most of the time and, therefore, more able to retrieve them from the battlefield.On the eve of the Geneva talks, President Zelensky had a telephone conversation with Trump and said he expected the Geneva meeting would lead to trilateral negotiations at the beginning of March - thus creating \"an opportunity to move talks to the leaders' level\". \"President Trump supports this sequence of steps,\" Zelensky said, adding: \"This is the only way to resolve all the complex and sensitive issues and finally end the war.\" Putin, for his part, has refused to meet Zelensky, describing him as illegitimate - an argument centring on the fact that no presidential election has been held in Ukraine, despite the expiry of Zelensky's term in March 2024.However, Ukraine's constitution bars holding elections under martial law - imposed in the wake of Putin's invasion of his neighbour.",

    "body": "Korean coast guard arrests helmsman who was on his phone when ferry ran aground21 minutes agoGeorge Wright and Leehyun Choi'I thought I might die': Passenger on South Korea ferry that ran aground speaks outTwo people have been arrested and a boat captain is under investigation after a ferry ran aground on rocks off South Korea's south-east coast. All 267 passengers and crew on board the Queen Jenuvia 2 were rescued after it became stuck near the uninhabited island of Jogdo, off the coast of Jangsan Island in Sinan County, on Wednesday. Twenty-seven people sustained minor injuries from the impact of grounding.The coast guard told the BBC they had arrested the helmsman and the first mate for gross negligence resulting in injuries.The helmsman initially blamed a steering wheel malfunction, but later admitted he had been on his phone and missed the point at which he was supposed to change course.The vessel has now docked at a nearby port.Authorities say they are still investigating the exact cause of the accident.Some passengers described it in real time on social media. \"There was a loud bang, and then the ship tilted,\" one was quoted as saying by South Korea's Yonhap news agency. \"An announcement told everyone to put on life jackets, so we're wearing them and waiting on the top deck.\"The 26,000-tonne ferry was travelling to the port city of Mokpo after departing from the resort island of Jeju, officials said.The area is near the site where the Sewol ferry sunk in 2014. More than 300 people were killed in that incident, mostly children heading for a school trip.The salvaged wreck of the Sewol ferry was brought to Mokpo nearly three years later.Describing Wednesday's incident, Kim Namhyun, a diving instructor on Jeju Island, told Reuters: \"I thought I might die. The sound was too loud.\"But having seen the Sewol ferry, I knew that in situations like this, you have to stay calm, move outside, wear a life jacket, and wait.\"",

    "body": "One of the world's first calculating machines will not go to auction as scheduled in France, after a Paris court provisionally blocked the historic item from being exported.Auction house Christie's has confirmed it will not proceed with bidding for the machine La Pascaline, developed by the French mathematician Blaise Pascal in 1642.Valuations suggested the machine could fetch €2m to 3m (£1.7m to £2.6m), and Christie's called it the \"most important scientific instrument ever offered at auction\".Scientists and researchers made a legal appeal to grant heritage protections to the historic instrument, arguing it should be classified as a \"national treasure\".Pascal was just 19 years old when he developed the earliest version of a calculator, Christie's said. There are only nine of these machines still in existence.\"It is the first attempt in history to substitute the human mind with a machine,\" the official collection description reads.\"Its invention marks a breakthrough, a 'quantum leap' whose importance and significance take on a very special meaning today.\"La Pascaline was exhibited at Christie's venues in New York and Hong Kong throughout the year. The machine was included in Christie's auction of the library of the late Catalonia collector Léon Parcé, which also featured Pascal's philosophical piece Pensées and the first printed version of \"Pascal's wager\".On Wednesday, a Paris administrative court temporarily blocked an earlier export authorisation provided by France's culture minister in May. Two experts had signed off on the minister's certificate, including one from the Louvre Museum.The judge concluded there were \"serious doubts\" over the legality of the certificate, a statement from the Paris court said, adding the decision was provisional until a final judgment is delivered.In a statement to the AFP news agency, a Christie's spokesperson said: \"Given the provisional nature of this decision and in accordance with the instructions of its client, Christie's is suspending the sale of La Pascaline.\" The court noted La Pascaline's historic and scientific value could qualify it as a \"national treasure\", guaranteeing protections under the France's heritage code.The French heritage group Association Sites & Monuments, which was listed as an applicant in the court filing, welcomed the decision.Additional reporting by Sebastian Usher, Global Affairs reporter",

    "body": "13 hours agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor and Guy Delauney,Balkans correspondentAFPThe club's owner, nearest the camera, is among those on trialThirty-five people and three institutions have gone on trial in North Macedonia over a devastating fire at a nightclub that killed 63, mainly young, people in March.\"I know about the pain of loved ones, we are all parents,\" Judge Diana Gruevska-Ilievska told the crowded courtroom, filled with defendants and dozens of victims' relatives. She promised the case would be conducted in a transparent and disciplined manner.Club Pulse, in the eastern town of Kocani, was packed with young Macedonians attending a concert by a popular hip-hop duo when sparks from pyrotechnic devices set fire to the ceiling.Prosecutors told the trial that years of failings had turned the club into a death trap.Three former mayors of Kocani, the nightclub's owner and public licensing officials are among those charged. They are accused of endangering public safety by allowing an unsafe venue to operate. The judge warned the court that the trial could last for \"five months or five years\".Defence lawyers attempted to delay the start of proceedings due to the charges being merged into a single case. The judge rebuffed them, ruling this did \"not violate any rights of the parties\".At the time of the tragedy, authorities said only one proper exit was functioning at the club as the back door had been locked.Sparks from the pyrotechnics spread quickly on the club's ceiling, which had been made of flammable material.About 500 people were inside the club at the time, leaving 59 dead and some 200 others injured. Four of the injured died later. Many were unable to escape because of blocked exits.Outrage after the fire prompted protests in the Macedonian capital Skopje and elsewhere, with victims' families organising local marches in Kocani itself. AFP via Getty ImagesLast Saturday, victims' families marched through the centre of Skopje holding pictures of those who diedAnother protest entitled \"March of the Angels\" took place in Skopje days before the trial began, organised under a Macedonian social media campaign called \"Who's Next?\". Prosecutors told the trial that the Kocani disaster was not the result of one person's actions or mistakes - rather it arose out of a series of institutional failures and a lack of responsibility.None of the defendants had wanted to face up to the danger that had been there for years, according to prosecutor Borche Janev.Prosecutors allege that licences for the club were issued unlawfully, inspections were not carried out and overcrowding was allowed at the venue. Another allegation is that there was no permit for the band to set off the pyrotechnic devices that started the fire.\"If we remain silent and lose the truth... we will never have the strength as a society to embark on a path to healing,\" Janev was quoted by local media as telling the court.",

    "body": "9 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterEPAAlbania's prime minister accused Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood of \"ethnic stereotyping\" after she singled out Albanian families in a speech about abuses of the asylum system.Edi Rama criticised Mahmood for telling MPs around 700 Albanian families were \"living in taxpayer-funded accommodation having failed their asylum claims\" as she announced major reforms on Monday.Rama called the number a \"statistical drop in the ocean of post-Brexit Britain's challenges\".Official data show the UK has deported more than 13,000 people to Albania since a returns deal was signed in 2022. Rama called the deal one of \"Europe's most successful partnerships on illegal migration.\"Mahmood's comments came as she announced major changes to the UK's \"out of control and unfair\" asylum system.Speaking in the House of Commons, Mahmood said: \"If we fail to deal with this crisis, we will draw more people down a path that starts with anger and ends in hatred.\"The reforms will make refugee status temporary, extend the wait for permanent settlement from five years to 20, and allow the removal of families with children who have no right to remain. Alongside tightening access to refugee status, the UK would create new legal routes to the UK, with an annual cap on numbers.As part of her speech, Mahmood told MPs \"we must remove those who have failed asylum claims, regardless of who they are\".\"There are, for instance, around 700 Albanian families living in taxpayer-funded accommodation having failed their asylum claims - despite an existing returns agreement, and Albania being a signatory to the European convention on human rights,\" she added.Posting on social media, Rama said: \"How can a Labour Home Secretary so poorly echo the rhetoric of the populist far-right – and single out 700 Albanian families, a statistical drop in the ocean of post-Brexit Britain's challenges – precisely at a moment when the UK and Albania have built one of Europe's most successful partnerships on illegal migration?\"\"Let us also be clear: Albanians are net contributors to the British economy, and the number of Albanians receiving UK benefits is very low relative to other communities. \"To single them out again and again is not policy - it is a troubling and indecent exercise in demagoguery.\"Official policy should never be driven by ethnic stereotyping. That is the very least humanity expects from the great Great Britain.\"Rama has repeatedly clashed with British politicians over their descriptions of Albanian nationals. In May, Sir Keir Starmer travelled to the Albanian capital Tirana only to be told by Rama he would not host UK \"return hubs\" for failed asylum seekers from other countries.During the same press conference, Rama accused the previous Conservative government of \"stigmatising\" Albanians and warning that \"cursing the Albanians was not a good idea, because the curse went back and they are now out of the parliament\".A combative figure on social media, Rama has also previously invited Reform UK leader Nigel Farage to come to Albania to debate his claim one in 50 Albanians in Britain were in prison. Rama dismissed the figure as \"bonkers\" and accused Farage of peddling \"post-truth Brexit playbook\" politics. ",

    "body": "15 hours agoDearbail Jordan and Simon AtkinsonYounger Australian teenagers on Instagram, Facebook and Threads are being told their accounts will be shut down ahead of the country's social media ban for under-16s.Meta, which owns the three brands, said it had begun notifying users it believes to be between 13 and 15 years old by text, email and in-app messages that their accounts would start being deactivated from 4 December.The ban in Australia comes into force on 10 December. It affects a number of platforms which also include TikTok, YouTube, X and Reddit.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the \"world-leading\" ban was aimed at \"letting kids be kids\". Meta and other firms oppose the measure but said they would comply. Australia's internet regulator has estimated there are 150,000 Facebook users and 350,000 teens on Instagram in the 13-15 age bracket.From 4 December, children aged below 16 will not be able to create accounts on Meta's social media platforms. The company said it was asking young users to update their contact details so they could be notified when they became eligible to open an account. They can download and save their posts, videos and messages before their accounts are shut down.Meta said that teens who said they were old enough to use Instagram, Facebook and Threads could challenge the restriction by taking a \"video selfie\" to be used in facial age scans.They could also provide a driver's licence or other government issued-ID.All these verification methods were tested by the UK-based Age Check Certification Scheme (ACCS) earlier this year, in a report commissioned by the Australian state.While the ACCS said that all methods had their merits, it added: \"We did not find a single ubiquitous solution that would suit all use cases, nor did we find solutions that were guaranteed to be effective in all deployments.\"Social media platforms which fail to take \"reasonable steps\" to block under-16s face fines of up to A$50m (£25m). \"While we are working hard to remove all users who we understand to be under the age of 16 by 10 December, compliance with the law will be an ongoing and multi-layered process,\" Antigone Davis, vice-president and global head of safety at Meta, told Reuters Financial.Meta wants to see a law where under-16s have to get parental approval before they download a social media app. The firm told Australia's Seven News: \"Teens are resourceful, and may attempt to circumvent age assurance measures to access restricted services.\"But it said: \"We're committed to meeting our compliance obligations and are taking the necessary steps to comply with the law.\"Australia's e-Safety Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said the ban was aimed at protecting teens \"from pressures and risks they can be exposed to while logged in to social media accounts\".In a move seemingly to avoid being included in the ban, gaming platform Roblox this week announced that children under 16 would be unable to chat to adult strangers.Mandatory age checks will be introduced for accounts using chat features, starting in December for Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, then the rest of the globe from January.The e-safety commissioner has published a list of which social media platforms will be impacted by the age ban.They are: FacebookInstagramKickRedditSnapchatThreadsTikTokX (formerly Twitter)YouTubePlatforms not included are:DiscordGitHubGoogle ClassroomLEGO PlayMessengerRobloxSteam and Steam ChatWhatsAppYouTube Kids",

    "body": "47 minutes agoRushdi Abualouf,Gaza correspondent, in Istanbul and David GrittenAt least 25 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, the Hamas-run health ministry has said, in what was one of the deadliest days since the ceasefire came into effect five weeks ago.Ten people were killed when a ministry of religious endowments building in the eastern Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City was hit, according to rescuers.Israel's military said it struck \"Hamas terrorist targets\" after gunmen opened fire towards an area where its soldiers were operating in the southern city of Khan Younis in violation of the ceasefire deal.Hamas questioned the claim and denounced what it said was a \"dangerous escalation\" that could jeopardise the ceasefire.The flare-up of violence comes after the UN Security Council passed a resolution that endorsed US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan to end two years of devastating war.Mahmoud Bassal, a spokesman for Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency, told the BBC that Israeli air, drone and artillery strikes hit several locations in Gaza City and Khan Younis shortly after sunset on Wednesday.The attacks marked a sharp escalation after several days of relative calm, he said.The Civil Defence reported that the strike in Zeitoun caused severe damage to the religious endowments ministry's building and surrounding structures, and posted a video showing its rescue workers appearing to find two people buried under rubble.Photos published by the Anadolu news agency meanwhile showed the bodies of three young children reportedly recovered from the scene.In a separate incident in Gaza City, one person was killed and several others were wounded when a drone struck a group of people at Shejaiya junction on Salah al-Din Street, Gaza's main north-south road, according to Mr Bassal.He said another person was killed when a tank shell struck a house belonging to the Balboul family in Shejaiya's Mushtaha Street, which is also in eastern Gaza City.The Civil Defence reported that another 13 people were killed in the Khan Younis area.Mr Bassal said three of them were killed in a strike on a group inside a sports club run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa).In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that \"several terrorists opened fire toward the area where IDF soldiers are operating in Khan Younis\" earlier on Wednesday.\"This action constitutes a violation of the ceasefire agreement. No IDF injuries were reported,\" it added. \"In response, the IDF began striking Hamas terrorist targets across the Gaza Strip.\"Israeli public broadcaster Kan cited a security source as saying the targets of the strikes were the commander of the Zeitoun Battalion of Hamas's military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, and the commander of its naval force.Hamas denounced the Israeli strikes, saying in a statement that it considered them a \"dangerous escalation through which the war criminal [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu seeks to resume the genocide against our people\".It also urged the US to \"honour its stated commitments and exert immediate pressure on Israel to enforce the ceasefire and halt its attacks\".But a US official told Reuters news agency that Hamas was aiming to break the ceasefire and not fulfil its commitment to disarm.On Monday, the UN Security Council passed a resolution that sought to shore up the fragile ceasefire, which took effect on 10 October.Member states authorised the creation of a transitional governance body called the Board of Peace, which will be chaired by President Trump, and a temporary International Stabilisation Force (ISF), which will be tasked with ensuring \"the process of demilitarizing the Gaza Strip\".Trump hailed the resolution as \"a moment of true historic proportion\".Hamas reiterated that it would not give up its weapons without a Palestinian state, arguing its fight against Israel was legitimate \"resistance\".Israel's ambassador to the UN stressed the importance of disarmament, saying that his country would \"not stop or let up\" until Hamas no longer presented \"a threat\".The Israeli military launched an offensive in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 69,500 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, including 280 during the ceasefire, according to the territory's health ministry.The Israeli military has said three of its soldiers have been killed in attacks in Gaza since the ceasefire began and that its has targeted scores of fighters.On Wednesday afternoon, Israel's military also carried out several strikes in southern Lebanon saying it targeted weapons storage facilities belonging to Hezbollah.Israel accuses the Iran-backed armed group of trying to rebuild its capabilities following a war that ended last November.",

    "body": "Senior Pentagon officials have arrived in Ukraine to \"discuss efforts to end the war\" with Russia, the US military has said.The team, led by US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, is expected to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Thursday when he returns from a trip to Turkey.Reports began surfacing on Wednesday that the US and Russia had prepared a new peace plan, containing major concessions from Ukraine. Neither Washington nor Moscow has officially confirmed the plan.Earlier in the day, at least 26 people were killed in a Russian missile and drone attack on Ukraine's western city of Ternopil, officials there said. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. \"Secretary Driscoll and team arrived this morning in Kyiv on behalf of the administration on a factfinding mission to meet Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war,\" Army spokesman Col David Butler said in a statement.Driscoll is joined by the US Army's chief of staff Gen Randy George, top US army commander in Europe Gen Chris Donahue, and Srg Maj of the Army Michael Weimer.Driscoll and Gen George are the most senior US military officials to hold talks in the Ukrainian capital since President Donald Trump took office in January.An image on Wednesday showed Driscoll meeting and shaking hands with Ukrainian Defence Minister Denys Shmyhal.In a post on X afterwards, Shmyhal said: \"We focused on the next steps for implementing the historic defence agreements reached by President Zelensky and President Trump\".He also thanked Washington for \"approving the sale of a support package for the PATRIOT air-defence system worth approximately $105m (£80m)\".Earlier, a Ukrainian official told CBS, the BBC's US media partner, that talks on the trip would focus on the military situation on the ground - as well as plans for a possible ceasefire. The official - who was not named - said: \"Presidents Zelensky and Trump have already agreed to stop the conflict along the existing lines of engagement, and there are agreements on granting security guarantees\".It comes as a number of outlets are reporting that the US and Russia have privately drawn up proposals on how to end the war.Citing people familiar with the matter, Axios, the Financial Times and Reuters reported that the plans call for Kyiv to give up some territories and weapons, as well as to significantly cut Ukraine's Armed Forces.Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian leader Vladimir Putin's envoy Kirill Dmitriev are believed to have been involved in working on the 28-point peace plan.The BBC has asked the White House and a representative for Witkoff to comment.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov appeared to downplay the reports.\"In this case, we have no additional innovations to what we call 'the spirit of Anchorage',\" he told Russia's state-run media on Wednesday - referring to the August summit between Putin and Trump in the US state of Alaska.Any agreements reached during the one-day meeting have not been made public.President Zelensky has repeatedly ruled out any territorial concessions to Russia.Kyiv and its Western allies, including the US, have been calling for an immediate ceasefire along the vast front line, but Moscow has ruled that out, repeating demands that Ukraine says amount to its de facto capitulation.Earlier this month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow's pre-conditions for a peace deal - including ceding territory, tough curbs on the size of Ukraine's military and the country's neutrality - had not changed since Putin laid them out two months before the full-scale invasion.Meanwhile, a White House official confirmed to the BBC that special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg will leave his post in January.He reportedly decided that this would be a natural end to his time in the post, which requires Senate approval beyond 360 days.Kellogg has been seen as an important advocate for Ukraine in the White House during a time when Trump has often appeared to side with Russia in the conflict.

    "body": "10 hours agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent, RomeDanish Defence HandoutThe Nord Stream pipeline, which runs between Russia and Germany under the Baltic Sea, was attacked in 2022 Italy's top appeals court has ruled that a Ukrainian man suspected of involvement in blowing up the Nord Stream gas pipelines between Russia and Germany should be extradited to Berlin.There, former Ukrainian military officer Serhiy Kuznetsov will face a charge of anti-constitutional sabotage. He is due to be removed from Italy under German police escort in the next few days.Prosecutors believe Mr Kuznetsov coordinated and led a group that planted explosives on the pipes deep beneath the Baltic Sea in 2022, though they have not disclosed any evidence.The case has serious implications for relations between Ukraine and Germany, which is the biggest source of military aid for Kyiv in Europe.Mr Kuznetsov's lawyer said his client \"feels like a scapegoat\" and is \"very sad\" that his government has not spoken out in his defence, or even confirmed that he was a serving soldier at the time of the blasts.\"If he carried out the attack, then he did so because he was ordered to do so because he was for sure a captain of the Ukrainian army,\" Nicola Canestrini said after Wednesday's hearing.The BBC has seen a copy of Mr Kuznetsov's military ID among the court papers. He has not commented publicly on whether he was involved in the explosions.\"The Ukrainian government knows exactly where he was every day of September 2022,\" his lawyer said. \"So, if he's innocent, why don't they say it? If he did it, why don't they say it? That's his question.\"The BBC has approached government and security sources in Kyiv, but they have not commented.Mr Kuznetsov was arrested in northern Italy in late August, at a glamping site near the city of Rimini where he had booked in for a few nights with his wife and two of their children.His passport details were entered online at check-in, and in Italy that information is automatically transferred to the carabinieri, the local police.Later that night, officers came knocking at the family's door.Serhiy Kuznetsov's lawyer Nicola Canestrini says his client feels like a \"scapegoat\"A month later, a second Ukrainian suspect was detained at his home close to Poland's capital Warsaw on another arrest warrant issued by Germany.Volodymyr Zhuravlyov, an amateur deep-sea diver, has lived in Poland with his family since just before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.He was held in custody for 17 days, but a court then refused to extradite him.The judge delivered a passionate speech, arguing that no Ukrainian could be prosecuted for what he characterised as a legitimate act of self-defence against Russia's \"bloody and genocidal\" invasion of Ukraine.In Italy, further from Ukraine, the mood and the politics are very different.Mr Canestrini described the Italian appeal court's ruling as a \"great disappointment\", but said the fight for his client would now move to Germany - with the aim of having Mr Kuznetsov acquitted on the same grounds.Many Ukrainians consider whoever did destroy Nord Stream to be heroes for taking out an important revenue source for Russia, and struggle to understand why Germany - a key ally of Ukraine - is pursuing this prosecution.On Wednesday, one man stood outside the palatial courthouse in Rome wrapped in a Ukrainian flag and holding a poster that read: \"Serhiy Kuznetsov is a defender, not a criminal.\"",

    "body": "Nearly every Republican in the US House of Representatives voted on a bill  to compel the release of documents tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The lone \"nay\" came from the Republican lawmaker from Louisiana, Clay Higgins, who defied his party saying his vote was a principled \"NO\".\"What was wrong with the bill three months ago is still wrong today,\" Higgins wrote on X. \"It abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure in America.\"The resounding vote in favour of the Epstein bill, 427-1, marks a rare moment of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill. Hours later, the US senate too approved the legislation, clearing the way for the final act - President Donald Trump's signature. For Higgins, safeguarding the personal information of Epstein's many victims was the primary issue with the legislation.\"As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people – witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc,\" he wrote on X. \"If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt.\"  Higgins said he would support the bill if it were to be amended by the Senate, which Republican majority leader John Thune had already suggested was unlikely. \"When a bill comes out of the House 427 to 1 and the president said he's going to sign it, I'm not sure that amending it is in the cards,\" Thune said before the Senate's unanimous approval for the bill on Tuesday.Prior to the House passing the legislation, only four Republicans had joined all Democrats in signing a petition to force a vote - Thomas Massie, Lauren Boebert, Nancy Mace and Marjorie Taylor Greene.But it achieved overwhelming Republican support after President Trump dropped his opposition to a vote.Higgins has represented Louisiana's third district since 2017 and is widely regarded as one of the most conservative members of Congress, according to his website.His holdout vote in the wake of 200-plus members of his party voting otherwise is not the first time he has taken an unorthodox stance.In 2024, House Republicans voted to censure Higgins for offensive remarks he made on social media after he called Haiti \"the nastiest country in the western hemisphere\" and referred to Haitians as \"eating pets\" and \"slapstick gangsters\". \"All these thugs better get their mind right and their ass out of our country before January 20th,\" Higgins wrote.Facebook removed two posts from Higgins in 2020, after he wrote he would \"drop any 10 of you where you stand\", referring to any armed protesters that might attend a Louisiana demonstration against police brutality.Facebook told Business Insider at the time the posts \"were removed for violating our policies against inciting violence\". Before Congress, Higgins was a member of Louisiana's St Landry's Parish Sheriff's Office. He resigned in 2016 amid backlash about a controversial anti-crime video where he was seen holding a rifle and making threats against gang members. The BBC has contacted Higgins's office for comment.

    "body": "Trump signs bill ordering justice department to release Epstein files2 hours agoSakshi Venkatraman and David Willis,North America correspondentWatch: \"I'm all for it\", Trump says on calls to release Epstein filesUS President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he signed a bill ordering the release of government files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The bill requires the justice department to release all information from its Epstein investigation within 30 days, although some could be withheld if they relate to an active investigation or are deemed to invade personal privacy.With Trump's support, the legislation overwhelmingly cleared both chambers of Congress, the House of Representatives and Senate, on Tuesday. After facing pushback from Epstein's victims and members of his own Republican Party, he changed his opposition to releasing the files last week.Until recently, Trump had dismissed the need to release the documents, recently calling it a Democrat-led \"hoax\" to \"deflect\" attention away from his party's work.\"Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" he wrote.What do we know about the Epstein files?Epstein files: Who else was mentioned?The only 'no' vote on releasing Epstein filesAlthough a congressional vote was not required to release the files - Trump could have ordered the release on his own - lawmakers in the House passed the legislation with a 427-1 vote. The Senate gave unanimous consent to pass it upon its arrival, sending the bill to Trump for his signature. The Epstein files subject to release under the legislation are documents from criminal investigations into the financier, including transcripts of interviews with victims and witnesses, and items seized in raids of his properties. Those materials include internal justice department communications, flight logs, and people and entities connected to Epstein.The files are different from the more than 20,000 pages of documents from Epstein's estate released by Congress last week, including some that directly mention Trump.Those include 2018 messages from Epstein in which he said of Trump: \"I am the one able to take him down\" and \"I know how dirty donald is\".Trump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.Speaking to reporters on Monday night, Trump said Republicans had \"nothing to do with Epstein\".\"It's really a Democrat problem,\" he said. \"The Democrats were Epstein's friends, all of them.\"The family of Virginia Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year, said in a statement Trump signing the bill was \"nothing short of monumental\", for Giuffre and other survivors. \"As we look towards the next chapter, we remain vigilant. This work is not finished. Every name must be revealed, regardless of power, wealth, or party affiliation,\" her brother and sister-in-law, Sky and Amanda Roberts, said.Getty ImagesEpstein was found dead in 2019 in his New York prison cell in what a coroner ruled was a suicide. He was being held on charges of sex trafficking. He had been convicted previously of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008.The once high-flying financier had ties with a number of high-profile figures, including Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, the brother of King Charles and former prince; Trump; Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon; and a cast of other characters from the world of media, politics and entertainment.On Wednesday, former Harvard president Larry Summers took a leave from teaching at the university while the school investigated his links to Epstein, revealed in a series of chummy email exchanges.  White House: Epstein story 'a manufactured hoax'Attorney General Pam Bondi is required to release \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" related to Epstein and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell no later than 30 days after the law is enacted. Maxwell currently is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking.But based on the law's text, portions could still be withheld if they are deemed to invade personal privacy or relate to an active investigation. The bill gives Bondi the power to withhold information that would jeopardise any active federal investigation or identify any victims. One of the bill's architects, Republican Congressman Thomas Massie, said he had concerns about some files being withheld.\"I'm concerned that [Trump is] opening a flurry of investigations, and I believe they may be trying to use those investigations as a predicate for not releasing the files. That's my concern,\" he said.Watch: Moment House passes bill to release Epstein files",

    "body": "'I hated that I looked Asian': KPop Demon Hunters star on her struggle for acceptance2 days agoChi Chi Izundu & Rebecca ThornBBC Global WomenBBCArden Cho stars as the voice of Rumi in KPop Demon Hunters, which topped Netflix charts in 93 countries\"I hated that I looked Asian, that I didn't have blue eyes and blonde hair, because that's what was beautiful at the time,\" says Arden Cho, the actress who voiced Rumi, star of Netflix's chart-topping animated film, KPop Demon Hunters.Speaking to the BBC World Service for the Global Women series, Cho, 40, is describing her childhood in Texas, as the eldest daughter of Korean immigrant parents and her struggle for acceptance in American society.In the film, which tells the story of a female K-Pop trio who must save the world from evil forces, Rumi has to come to terms with her identity as part human, part demon - and when Cho first read the script this resonated powerfully.\"Being born in America, feeling American but having people treat me like I'm not, trying to figure out my identity as an Asian-American, as a Korean-American, as a woman,\" she says.These were all elements of her early life that mirrored Rumi's journey.\"I can honestly say that at different points in my life, I hated a lot of myself and I wanted to be someone else.\"As kids, what you see shapes who you become and I feel like I just didn't see enough people that look like me.\"NetflixCho says the film has led to \"Korea being loved\" more than ever beforeWhen it launched on Netflix in June, KPop Demon Hunters registered 33 million views in just two weeks, and reached the top 10 of the Netflix charts in 93 countries. To star in the first Hollywood animated film set in Korea, with Korean leads, was for Cho \"a dream come true\" – but it has also made her a powerful role model for Asian-American children, of the kind that she lacked when she was young.Cho says many Korean-Americans have told her it's \"such a refreshing moment\", making them proud for the first time of their dual heritage and culture.\"I feel like K-Pop really, truly, has paved the way. K-beauty has had such a big impact on Korea being loved. But I feel like this movie is the one that tipped it over the edge of, everybody wants to go to Korea, now,\" Cho says.But the film's success was not guaranteed and Cho says she felt the team making it were \"sometimes facing an uphill battle\".\"I feel like it kind of sucks to say this, but any time there's an Asian-led project, people feel like it's a risk,\" she says.So, when she took on the role, she made an effort to meet everyone working on the film in person, she says.Getty ImagesJi-Young Yoo (left) and May Hong (right) are also voice actors in the filmThe film was released against the backdrop of increased immigration raids in the US as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation effort, targeting those who are in the country illegally, which sparked protests in many states.As an Asian-American living in the US \"it's heartbreaking and disappointing,\" says Cho. \"Immigrants have made America what it is.\"Korean news sources have estimated that up to 150,000 Korean immigrants without proper documentation, including adopted children, are among those who could be deported.Cho says that when she was younger, people didn't know what it meant to be Korean in the USAs an adult, Cho came to realise that the racism she had experienced when she was younger stemmed mainly from a lack of education, as people didn't know what it meant to be Korean or Asian.\"But now in this day and age, when I feel like the world and people should know better, it is beyond disappointing and sometimes I feel like we feel so hopeless,\" she says.Because of this, it feels very special, she says, that KPop Demon Hunters could bring \"hope and joy and love to all these different communities\".\"Maybe that's why it's sort of like this movie of the summer, because we just needed some hope and something to unite us all together.\"The growth of AI is a major concern for the film industry, raising the possibility that in future it could be used to make a film like KPop Demon Hunters.Cho says she is aware that AI is already being used to replicate actors' voices, but wants to \"have hope in humanity\" that people will still seek out art created by humans.\"Sure, I'm sure they're going to have AI actors and singers. I know they already exist. I know our voices are already being manipulated, but I hope people have some respect and want and love for something real.\"KPop Demon Hunters has also been dominating the global music charts, with seven tracks from its soundtrack featured on the Billboard Hot 100. It has its own fan art, and audiences around the world are demanding a sequel.Cho tells us she wishes she could answer the question of whether that will happen - but both she and fans will have to wait for Netflix or Sony Pictures Entertainment, which made the film, to give it the green light.\"I know there's lots of murmurs, I've heard wonderful things,\" she says. \"So we shall see, and I think everyone in the world would riot if there wasn't.\"Starting conversations, building connections and challenging misinformation through features, investigations, interviews and extraordinary stories",

    "body": "The family of a Muslim man, who was lynched by a Hindu mob in India's Uttar Pradesh state in 2015, say they will continue fighting for justice after authorities recently moved to drop all charges against the accused. Mohammad Akhlaq, then 50, was beaten to death after rumours spread that he had stored and consumed beef, a claim his family continues to deny. Slaughter of cows is a sensitive issue in India as the animal is considered sacred by Hindus, who comprise 80% of the country's 1.4 billion people. Uttar Pradesh is among the 20 states with strict laws banning cow slaughter and the sale and consumption of beef.The attack, which took place in Dadri - 49km (31 miles) from the capital Delhi - was the first major and widely reported case of cow-related violence in India and sparked widespread protests. Akhlaq's family's lawyer told BBC Hindi that 18 people were charged for various offences, including murder and rioting. All of them are out on bail.Now the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led state government of Uttar Pradesh has asked a local court to drop the charges against the men. In an application filed last month, the public prosecutor argued there were \"inconsistencies\" in the witness testimonies in identifying the accused and asked the court to close the case. The court is expected to decide on whether it would accept the application on 12 December. The news has shocked Akhlaq's family, who say they are prepared to challenge the government's plea. \"We never thought that our fight of 10 years would be attempted to be closed off like this,\" his younger brother Jaan Mohammad told BBC Hindi. The family left the village shortly after the killing and has not returned.\"Now, we are scared for our safety even more,\" Mr Mohammad said. \"Will this [move to withdraw the case] not embolden the criminals?\" Mr Mohammad says he will never forget the night his brother was murdered. Akhlaq had been sleeping with his 22-year-old son Danish on 28 September 2015, when a mob wielding sticks, swords and cheap pistols barged into their home, accusing the family of having slaughtered a cow and eating it. The family said it later found out that the mob attacked him after an announcement was made from a Hindu temple that someone had slaughtered and eaten a cow. The accused men found some meat in the fridge that the family insists was mutton, and held it as proof. While Akhlaq died on the spot, his son was seriously injured in the attack.The case sparked widespread outrage. Although initial arrests came within a week, the chargesheet took three months to file.Many also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for speaking about the incident days after Akhlaq's death, while some BJP members, then in power at the federal level, were accused of defending the attackers.One party leader had described the lynching as an \"accident\", while another said consuming beef was unacceptable. The police, in its first chargesheet, named 15 main accused, including a juvenile and a local BJP leader's son, along with 25 witnesses. Four more accused were later added, bringing the total to 19; one died in 2016.Last month, the Uttar Pradesh government argued that witnesses, including Akhlaq's family, had given conflicting statements during the investigation.It noted that Akhlaq's wife initially named 10 people in her complaint, while his daughter Shaista cited 16, and his son Danish 19.\"Despite both the parties living in the same village, the witnesses have changed the number of accused,\" the application says.Mohammad Yusuf Saifi, Akhlaq's family lawyer, said the \"chaos and confusion\" at the time of the incident made it understandable that not every witness saw all involved.\"The only thing to see is whether there is any evidence against the people who have been named,\" he said. The application also noted that police seized five sticks, iron rods and bricks from the accused, but found no firearms or swords, contrary to what Akhlaq's wife had stated in her complaint.It further stated that officials had recovered beef from the scene. In 2016, a  case was filed against Akhlaq's family under the cow slaughter law - and is still pending before a court in Uttar Pradesh. The family has however has repeatedly denied the allegation.Mr Saifi, alleged the case was meant to \"pressurise\" the family, noting that a local veterinary report identified the meat as goat, not cow. As the family anxiously waits for the court's verdict, they are holding out hope. \"I still have faith in the court,\" Akhlaq's brother, Mr Mohammad, said. \"I believe justice would be done one day.\"",

    "body": "Baby Shark: How a 90-second clip created a $400m business1 day agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesWhen Kim Min-seok gave the go-ahead in June 2016 to publish a 90-second clip of a children's song, he had no idea what he was unleashing.It became a global phenomenon, clocking up more than 16 billion views - YouTube's most watched video ever.That song was the incredibly catchy Baby Shark.Not only has it captivated toddlers and terrorised adults around the world, it laid the foundations for its creator Pinkfong to become a media business worth hundreds of millions of dollars.“We didn’t expect it to stand out from our other content,\" Mr Kim, Pinkfong's chief executive, told the BBC from the firm's headquarters in Seoul.\"But looking back, it became a major turning point that set the stage for our global journey.”Getty ImagesPinkfong chief executive Kim Min-seok at the firm's stock market listing ceremonyOn Tuesday, that journey took Pinkfong to the South Korean stock market, where its shares rose by more than 9% on their debut, giving it a valuation of more than $400m (£304m).'We didn't expect a salary' Founded in 2010 as SmartStudy, the firm made digital content for children up to 12 years of age. It had just three employees, including Mr Kim and the firm's chief technology officer, Dongwoo Son.\"The office was tiny - even smaller than this,\" recalled Mr Kim, gesturing to the conference room he was calling from.It was so small \"we didn't even expect a salary at the time\", he said through a translator.Getty ImagesThe firm was renamed Pinkfong after its cheerful and curious fox character in 2022Pinkfong went through several major overhauls, including shifting its focus to toddlers.The firm grew to around 100 employees and prioritised simpler, learning-based games and content. \"And that's when Baby Shark emerged,\" Mr Kim said.The firm has been known as The Pinkfong Company since 2022, a name inspired by a cheerful and curious fox that featured in one of its early cartoons.It now has around 340 employees, with offices in Tokyo, Shanghai and Los Angeles.The Baby Shark momentBaby Shark is believed to have originated in the US in the 1970s and was often sung at children's summer camps.The song, which repeats the phrase \"Baby shark, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo\" is \"attractive for children, though possibly annoying for adults,\" said media analyst Kevin Chew from the Nanyang Technological University. Mr Kim is also very aware of just how catchy it is.\"It's like a K-pop song. It's very fast-paced, rhythmical and it's addictive,\" he said, adding that the tune has a \"chanting\" effect, which makes it easy for children to remember.But it was not an instant hit and only gained traction when its dance routine was featured at children's events in South East Asia.Videos of children and adults dancing to the song started to spread online and the clip went viral.There was a \"festival-like feeling\" in the Pinkfong office, as the team watched its viewing numbers soar, Mr Kim said.In November 2020, the Baby Shark clip claimed the title of YouTube's most viewed.It generated around half of the firm's revenue in the years immediately after the video's release and became a springboard for new content and merchandise, he said.Baby Shark: It's got a catchy tune and plans for world domination - but the toddler hit is older than you thinkBut Pinkfong faced a legal challenge in 2019 when it was accused of plagiarising the work of an American composer.South Korea's Supreme Court rejected the case, after the company argued that its version was derived from a folk song in the public domain.The victory, Mr Kim said, gave the firm a lift as its shares went public. He added that the stock market application had been filed before the verdict was announced.One-hit wonder?Pinkfong's other franchises like Bebefinn and Sealook are growing fast but the firm must prove its success is not just reliant on Baby Shark, said Korea University business lecturer Min Jung Kim.The company's target audience is a major plus as toddlers tend to watch the same material repeatedly, she said. Kim Min-seok insists his business can grow beyond Baby Shark, which currently accounts for about a quarter of Pinkfong's revenue. Meanwhile, Bebefinn has leapt ahead, generating roughly 40% of the firm's earnings.One parent told the BBC that his family has mixed feelings about Pinkfong's videos.Father of two Saleem Nashef said he appreciates the educational qualities of the firm's content but his wife thinks Baby Shark is \"too over-stimulating for kids\". Still, the viral video is apparently inescapable, as his daughter, who is about to turn three, will have a Baby Shark-themed birthday party.Whether Pinkfong can create other characters to match Baby Shark's commercial appeal remains unclear, said Prof Kim.It raised almost $52m in its stock market debut and plans to use the money to expand its line-up of films and characters, said Mr Kim.The company also aims to become a \"tech-driven\" content creator, using viewing patterns and other data to shape its new projects.Pinkfong has already achieved \"what many creators have always dreamed of,\" Mr Kim said.But now it must show investors that it is not just a one-hit wonder.",

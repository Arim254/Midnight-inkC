    "body": "2 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporter, Calgary, AlbertaReutersPierre Poilievre spoke to a full room of Conservative supporters in Calgary on Friday, where he pitched himself to stay on as leaderPierre Poilievre has cemented his position as Canada's Conservative Party leader, having received a strong endorsement from members despite presiding over recent electoral defeats.He secured 87.4% of votes in the leadership review, held on Friday in Calgary among delegates instead of the wider membership, after delivering a speech calling for Canadians to stay united in the face of an \"uncertain world\" and amid growing separatist sentiments in Alberta and Quebec. \"A house divided cannot stand,\" Poilievre said.A leadership review is automatically triggered after an election loss - in this case Poilievre's defeat to Mark Carney's Liberals last April, in which he also lost his own seat. Despite the political setbacks, delegates who spoke to the BBC said that they still had confidence in Poilievre to lead them into the next election.\"As far as the party is concerned, I think we're in the right direction,\" said Thomas Bambrick, a delegate from Winnipeg, adding that the vote result equals to a \"resounding yes\" for trust in the Conservative leader. Ahead of the vote, Poilievre delivered a nearly hour-long speech that doubled as a pitch to Conservative voters at the party's convention in Calgary, Alberta, where he outlined his vision for Canada's future should his party form the next government. Canada's conservative leader faces leadership testWho is Pierre Poilievre?He focused much of his messaging on affordability and crime - issues that have long resonated with his base - and promised a small government that would represent \"people who have felt unseen for too long\". Poilievre also touched on geopolitical tensions facing Canada, including its strained relationship with the US, arguing that the same domestic policies he was pitching will also help Canada \"stand on its own two feet\". His speech was made on a backdrop of a growing grassroots separatist movement in the Conservative stronghold of Alberta, where a process of collecting signatures to trigger an independence referendum is under way. In Quebec, the sovereignist Parti Québécois is also polling ahead, promising its own independence referendum in the province should it be elected to the provincial government later this year. Poilievre addressed these threats to Canadian unity in his speech, blaming the Liberal Party for people losing \"hope in the confederation\". Party members who spoke to the BBC said the speech was well received, praising it for sticking to traditional Conservative messaging while also confronting separatism - what one member called \"the elephant in the room\".Ballots in Friday's vote were cast in person by delegates who were selected to represent Conservative voters in each constituency across Canada.Poilievre has remained popular with his party despite the Conservative's unexpected loss last year, as well as the loss of the seat he had held for more than 20 years.In recent months, two elected Conservative MPs have left the party to join the Liberals, who under Carney have adopted more centrist policies, raising questions about the party's unity and Poilievre's leadership. But supporters of Poilievre credit him with delivering historic gains for the party, which received a record 41% of the popular vote last year. In particular, the Conservative leader has been successful in courting young voters through his messaging on affordability issues like the cost of living and housing. He has struggled, however, with defining his party's stance on US President Donald Trump, whom many Canadians have come to view as an existential threat due to his tariffs on Canadian goods and his rhetoric around it becoming the 51st US state.Poilievre has also struggled with his likeability, with surveys showing that more than half of Canadians hold a negative view of him. Many cite his tone, which they view as overly combative. Polls indicate his party is still trailing, with a Léger poll released this week showing the Conservatives nine points behind the Liberals.Poilievre addressed some of the shortcomings in his speech on Friday, telling party members that a lesson he learned is to not waver on his messaging. \"You told us to ignore the voices who keep telling us to abandon our conservative principles,\" he said as the audience applauded. \"We will stay true to our principles.\"",

    "body": "17 hours agoBrandon DrenonReutersLuigi Mangione, the man accused of gunning down UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson, will not face the death penalty if convicted, a court has ruled.US District Judge Margaret Garnett dismissed the federal firearms charges against the 27-year-old that carried the possibility of capital punishment.He will still face stalking charges, which can bring a maximum sentence of life in prison.Mangione was arrested days after he allegedly shot Thompson as the health insurance firm CEO walked into a New York City hotel on 4 December 2024. He has pleaded not guilty to all federal and state charges.After the ruling, Mangione's attorney Karen Agnifilo thanked the court for \"this incredible decision\", according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. \"We're all very relieved,\" she said. \"We're prepared, and have been prepared, to fight this case, and we look forward to fighting this case.\"In her ruling, Garnett, an appointee of former US President Joe Biden, said two of the four federal charges did not meet \"the federal statutory definition of a 'crime of violence' as matter of law\". She noted that her decision was \"solely to foreclose the death penalty as an available punishment to be considered by the jury\".Garnett's ruling was a setback for the justice department, which had called Thompson's murder a \"premeditated, cold-blooded assassination\".The judge has given the government 30 days to challenge her decision to rule out the death penalty in the case.In a win for prosecutors, Garnett said they could present evidence to the jury from Mangione's backpack that he had at the time of his arrest at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania.Among the items in the bag were a gun, fake IDs and a notebook with writings that allegedly detailed Mangione's grievances against the US healthcare system. Defence attorneys had sought to dismiss that evidence from trial, arguing that authorities obtained it illegally without a warrant. Mangione, an Ivy League graduate from a wealthy Maryland family, is also facing nine charges in a separate case brought by New York state prosecutors, including second-degree murder.Thompson, a 50-year-old father of two, was shot from behind by a masked gunman as he walked into a Manhattan hotel for an annual investor conference. Investigators say the words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were written on shell casings found at the scene of Thompson's murder.Law enforcement sources say this may have been a reference to the \"three Ds of insurance\" - tactics used by companies to reject payment claims by patients.Jury selection in the federal trial is due to begin on 8 September, with opening statements due to start on 13 October. But state prosecutors are seeking to try Mangione as soon as July.In a separate incident, a Minnesota man was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly impersonating an FBI agent in an attempt to free Mangione from the Brooklyn jail he is being held in. The suspect - Mark Anderson - was carrying a barbecue fork and pizza cutter, prosecutors say. He is now being held at the same facility as Mangione.",

    "body": "21 hours agoMaia DaviesAPAlex Pretti worked as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs hospitalThe Department of Justice (DOJ) has opened a civil rights investigation into the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents, the US deputy attorney general has said.Todd Blanche said he did not want to \"overstate\" the move, calling it \"a standard investigation by the FBI when there are circumstances like what we saw\".The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the FBI would lead the investigation into Pretti's shooting in Minneapolis, with support from the DOJ's Civil Rights Division. His death came just weeks after Renee Good was shot dead by federal officers in the same city.\"We're looking at everything that would shed light on that day,\" Blanche told a news conference.He added the investigation would \"to the extent it needs to\" involve lawyers at the civil rights division.The investigation was previously being led by the Homeland Security Investigations branch of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the BBC's US partner CBS News reported.According to a preliminary DHS report sent to Congress, two officers fired their weapons at Pretti during a scuffle. Initial official accounts had alleged Pretti brandished his gun.The 37-year-old intensive care nurse, who was a US citizen, is understood to have joined protests in the city after Renee Good was shot dead by an ICE agent in Minneapolis on 7 January.Their deaths sparked fresh demonstrations in the state, and prompted public outcry across the US and criticism from lawmakers in both parties.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey have called for federal agents to be withdrawn entirely from the state's capital region.The state has also asked a federal judge to stop Operation Metro Surge, the DHS's immigration enforcement initiative which began on 1 December and involves some 3,000 officers.President Donald Trump has said his administration is \"going to de-escalate a little bit\" in Minnesota, while his border tsar Tom Homan said on Thursday that the administration planned to \"draw down\" federal forces if local officials co-operated.\"We are not surrendering our mission at all. We're just doing it smarter,\" Homan told a news conference in Minneapolis, without specifying what form a de-escalation might take.",

    "body": "11 hours agoKwasi Gyamfi AsieduWashingtonBloomberg via Getty ImagesThe US federal government has partially shutdown despite a last-ditch funding deal approved by the Senate.The funding lapse began at midnight US eastern time (05:00 GMT) on Saturday, hours after senators agreed to fund most agencies until September. The bill includes just two weeks' funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration enforcement, instead of shutting it down entirely.The bill has yet to be approved by the House of Representatives, which is out of session.US President Donald Trump struck the deal with Democrats after they refused to give more funding for immigration enforcement following the fatal shooting of two US citizens in Minneapolis by federal agents.It is the second such government shutdown in the past year and comes just 11 weeks after the end of the previous funding impasse that lasted 43 days, the longest in US history. That shutdown in 2025, which spanned 1 October to 14 November, had widespread impacts on essential government services including air travel and left hundreds of thousands of federal workers without pay for weeks.This shutdown, however, is unlikely to be that long or widespread as the House of Representatives is set to be back in session on Monday. The White House, though, has directed several agencies, including the departments of transportation, education and defence to execute shutdown plans.\"Employees should report to work for their next regularly scheduled tour of duty to undertake orderly shutdown activities,\" a White House memo to agencies said. \"It is our hope that this lapse will be short.\"Trump has urged Republicans, who hold the majority of seats in the US House, to vote for the deal.Lawmakers plan to use the fortnight in which the DHS will continue to be funded to negotiate a deal. Democrats want that deal to include new policies for immigration enforcement agents.\"We need to rein in ICE and end the violence,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\"That means ending roving patrols. It means requiring rules, oversight, and judicial warrants... Masks need to come off, cameras need to stay on, and officers need visible identification. No secret police.\"Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have sharply criticised tactics used by immigration agents in the wake of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis last weekend.Pretti, an intensive care nurse, was shot by a US Border Patrol agent after an altercation in which several agents tried to restrain him. On Friday, the Justice Department launched a civil rights investigation into the shooting.",

    "body": "14 minutes agoSofia Ferreira SantosAnadolu via Getty ImagesSeveral strikes have been reported across the Strip, including in Khan YounisAt least 28 people have been killed in a wave of Israeli air strikes across the Gaza Strip on Saturday, according to local authorities.The civil defence agency, which is operated by Hamas, says children and women were among those killed. It added that in one attack, helicopter gunships hit a tent sheltering displaced people in the southern city of Khan Younis.Palestinians have described these strikes as the heaviest since the second phase of the ceasefire, brokered by President Trump in October, came into effect earlier this month.The Israeli military confirmed that a number of strikes were carried out in response to what it said was a Hamas violation of the agreement on Friday.Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating the truce since it came into effect last year.In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said \"eight terrorists were identified exiting the underground terror infrastructure in eastern Rafah\", an area in Gaza where Israeli forces are deployed under the October agreement.The IDF said it had, together with the Israel Security Agency (ISA), struck targets in various locations including \"four commanders and additional terrorists\" as well as a weapons storage facility, a weapons manufacturing site and \"two launch sites belonging to Hamas in the central Gaza Strip\".Hamas has condemned the strikes and urged the US to take immediate action, adding that \"these ongoing violations\" confirm that the Israeli government \"continues its brutal war of genocide against the strip\".It said that seven of the victims were from one displaced family in Khan Younis, with a civil defence spokesman adding that the strikes hit residential apartments, tents, shelters and a police station.Officials at Gaza City's Shifa hospital said an air strike on the city hit a residential apartment, killing three children and two women.\"We found my three little nieces in the street. They say 'ceasefire' and all. What did those children do? What did we do?\" said Samer al-Atbash, an uncle of the three dead children, according to Reuters news agency.Video footage and images from across Gaza showed several bodies being lifted out of rubble and a number of buildings destroyed.Egypt's foreign ministry condemned the strikes in a statement seen by AFP news agency, and urged all parties to \"exercise the utmost restraint\".The war between Israel and Hamas began after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,660 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.It says at least 509 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire began on 10 October 2025. Four Israeli soldiers have also been killed.The health ministry's figures have been deemed reliable by the UN and other human rights groups and widely cited by international media. Israel does not allow news organisations, including the BBC, into Gaza to report independently.",

    "body": "3 hours agoPaul NjieHassan Lali / BBCSources say the mine, currently under rebel control, has been poorly maintainedMore than 200 people have been killed in a mine collapse in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, rebel authorities have said.The mine, in the town of Rubaya, gave way on Wednesday due to heavy rains, Lumumba Kambere Muyisa, spokesman for the North Kivu region's rebel governor, told reporters. At the time, the death toll remained unclear.Women and children were among those mining coltan - a mineral used to manufacture electronics such as smartphones and computers - at the time.A former supervisor of the mine told the BBC the site was not properly maintained, making accidents more likely and hampering rescue efforts when they occur.He added that the fragile nature of the soil made the situation worse.Women, children and artisanal miners - those not officially employed by a mining firm - are among those killed in the collapse. Around 20 survivors are said to be receiving treatment in hospital.A source whose cousin died in the landslide expressed shock, saying it was \"a big loss\" for the family and community.\"I didn't believe he could pass away in such circumstances,\" the source, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC, describing his cousin as a \"courageous\" and \"ambitious\" man whose main goal was to provide for his wife and two children.\"I didn't believe [he was dead] because investigations were still ongoing. His body wasn't found after the accident, so I did have hope that he could be found alive. Unfortunately, some hours later, his body was discovered.\"Governor Erasto Bahati Musanga, who was appointed by M23 rebels after seizing swathes of territory in North Kivu, visited survivors of the incident on Friday.Rubaya is one of a number of towns across North Kivu under the control of the M23, who international observers say are backed by neighbouring Rwanda.The mines in Rubaya hold about 15% of the world's coltan supply and half of the DR Congo's total deposits. The metallic ore contains tantalum, which is used to produce high-performance capacitors in a range of electronic devices, making it in high demand worldwide.When a BBC team visited the site in July 2025, they observed miners digging manually to source the precious mineral. Conditions at the site are very bad, with dangerous pits dotted around its vast expanse.Since 2024, the M23 rebels have been in control of the mines. The UN has accused the group of imposing taxes on the mining sector for their own benefit.The BBC has contacted the Congolese government in Kinshasa for comment.",

    "body": "19 hours agoMaia DaviesEPATrump declined to say whether there was a timeline for withdrawing a large US naval fleet from waters near IranDonald Trump has said Iran wants to make a deal rather than face US military action, despite Tehran's insistence that its missile and defence systems will \"never\" be up for negotiation.\"I can say this, they do want to make a deal,\" the US president told reporters at the White House on Friday when asked about a build-up of forces in the Gulf, without providing details.He had warned Tehran on Wednesday that time was \"running out\" to negotiate a deal on its nuclear programme after a large US naval fleet had gathered near the country.Iran's foreign minister said there were no talks planned with the US at present but that Tehran was open to negotiations based on \"mutual respect\" and trust.Also on Friday, the Kremlin said the head of the Iran's Supreme National Security Council Ali Larijani had met Russian President Vladimir Putin.They discussed \"Middle Eastern and international issues\" among other matters, state news agency Ria-Novosoti reported.Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and has repeatedly denied accusations by the US and its allies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.Asked on Friday whether he had given Tehran a deadline by which to strike a deal, Trump said that \"only they know for sure\".He told reporters: \"Hopefully we'll make a deal. If we do make a deal, that's good. If we don't make a deal, we'll see what happens.\"He said a large \"Armada\" was on its way to the region and declined to give a timeline for its withdrawal: \"We'll see how it all works out. They have to float someplace, so they might as well float near Iran.\"Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had said earlier that the country's missile defence systems would \"never\" be on the negotiating table, and repeated the government's position that its nuclear programme was peaceful.At a press conference with his Turkish counterpart after talks in Istanbul to avert US action, he said preparations were needed for \"fair and just negotiations\".He had said help was \"on the way\", before saying he had been told the execution of demonstrators had stopped.On Thursday, he said he had told Iran that it had to do two things to avoid military action: \"Number one, no nuclear. And number two, stop killing protesters.\"The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it had confirmed the killing of more than 6,300 people, including more than 5,900 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December.It said it was also investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks.Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned the final toll could exceed 25,000.",

    "body": "22 hours agoNicolas NégoceBBC Africa, AbidjanAFP/Getty ImagesMamadou Hawa Gassama, seen here on a demonstration in 2018, is known for his outspokennessA Malian lawmaker has been jailed in neighbouring Ivory Coast for three years for insulting the 84-year-old Ivorian leader, who recently won a fourth term in office.Mamadou Hawa Gassama, who serves in the transitional parliament set up by Mali's junta, was arrested last July while on a trip to Ivory Coast.Prosecutors said he described President Alassane Ouattara as a \"tyrant\", \"an enemy of Mali\" and strongly criticised his leadership in interviews and on social media.Since Mali's military took power in 2020, relations with Ivory Coast have been strained. Ouattara, an ally of France - the former colonial power in both nations - has been critical of the takeover and other coups in West Africa.Since the Malian politician's arrest in Abidjan last July, the authorities in Bamako have not commented on the case.\"We believe that this decision is... excessive... it is very severe,\" the AFP news agency quotes Gassama's lawyer Mamadou Ismaila Konate as saying.Prosecutors argued that Gassama's remarks went beyond political critique, accusing him of deliberately seeking to undermine Ivorian institutions and sow discord between the two neighbours.It is a reminder of the diplomatic row that blew up two years after the coup, when 49 Ivorian soldiers were sentenced in Mali to 20 years in prison for undermining state security.Since then, Mali's military leaders have overseen the exit of the UN peacekeeping mission and French forces, which had deployed to Mali in 2013 to help deal with an escalating jihadist insurgency.Instead it has sought closer ties with Russia - and Russian mercenaries have been brought in to deal with the insecurity affecting several countries in the vast Sahel region.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "24 hours agoDanielle KayeandNick Edser,Business reportersReutersUS President Donald Trump has picked Kevin Warsh to lead the US Federal Reserve when current chairman Jerome Powell's four-year term ends in May.Warsh is a former Fed governor and was considered for chair during Trump's first term. He has been an outspoken Fed critic and is expected to support lower interest rates in the near term.The appointment comes amid mounting worries about the Fed's independence, following Trump's increasing attacks on Powell in recent months.Powell has angered Trump by not cutting interest rates quickly enough, and federal prosecutors recently opened a criminal investigation over testimony he gave to the Senate about renovations to Fed buildings.The Department of Justice (DoJ) probe prompted a forceful condemnation from Powell and messages of support from former Fed chairs and central bank heads.Warsh, who served as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011, had re-emerged in recent weeks as a potential choice for the top job as speculation grew over who would replace the under-fire incumbent.Announcing the nomination on Truth Social, Trump said Warsh \"will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best\".Warsh's appointment still needs to be approved by the Senate, meaning it could face lengthy delays.If confirmed for the role, he will take the helm of the Fed at an unusually tense time, as economists and Wall Street investors monitor threats to the central bank's autonomy.Who is Kevin Warsh? Warsh, a 55-year-old economist, is a fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution and serves on the board of courier UPS. He has been an outspoken Fed critic, lambasting everything from the central bank's heavy reliance on data to its use of assets on its balance sheet.Warsh has escalated his rhetoric since emerging as a contender for the top Fed job, going as far as calling for \"regime change\".He had a relatively \"hawkish\" reputation as a Fed governor, meaning he tended to favour higher interest rates and took more seriously concerns about inflation.But he is now seen as a voice that would support lower rates in the near term. He has argued the Fed should shrink its balance sheet in order to bring down short-term interest rates, though some have questioned his logic.The Fed this week voted to hold interest rates steady, despite the White House pushing for a cut. Policymakers are continuing to monitor the effect on the economy of last year's trio of interest rate cuts.There are signs the US employment market is stabilising - job creation is sluggish but the unemployment rate has ticked lower. Inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target.\"Warsh will have to convince his colleagues that rate cuts are appropriate this year, an argument that is unlikely to win unless the labour market shows renewed signs of weakening or inflationary pressures ease materially later this year,\" economists at Deutsche Bank wrote in a research note on Friday.Warsh also has close family connections to Trump's orbit. He is married to Jane Lauder, whose family is known for the Estee Lauder cosmetics group. His father-in-law, billionaire businessman Ronald Lauder, is a long-time Trump donor and ally.Republican Senator Thom Tillis, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, has said he will oppose Trump's nominees until the potential legal case against Powell is resolved.Trump has also taken aim at Fed governor Lisa Cook, whom he wants to remove. He has accused her of engaging in mortgage fraud, which she has denied. The Supreme Court is now assessing the case.Warsh had been seen of one of four leading candidates for the Fed job. The other frontrunners were White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, Fed governor Christopher Waller and Wall Street bond guru Rick Rieder.When Warsh takes up his role, financial markets will keep a close eye on how independently he acts of President Trump.Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said Warsh \"seems like a relatively safe choice\".\"Warsh's long-running hawkish views should help to counteract concerns that he might morph into a full-blown Trump stooge,\" he added.As news of Warsh's impending nomination started to leak out, the dollar strengthened slightly while the price of gold sank by 6%.Stuart Clark, portfolio manager at wealth management business Quilter, said investors would be \"breathing somewhat of a sigh of relief\" at Warsh's nomination.\"Warsh was in contention for the job back in 2017 and as such comes to the role with a level of authority that is respected across the market,\" he added.\"Concerns around Fed independence and an erosion on this should now be tempered, although Warsh's words and actions will be scrutinised by market participants intensely.\"",

    "body": "Why China moved so quickly to execute 11 members of a notorious mafia family2 days agoJonathan HeadSouth East Asia correspondentCCTVDozens of members of the Ming family were sentenced in SeptemberNo-one should be surprised that China has swiftly executed the 11 members of an organised crime family from north-eastern Myanmar who were sentenced to death in  September.China executes more people than anywhere else in the world, according to  human rights groups – the exact figure is a state secret. Officials are often executed for corruption. The accusations made against the Ming family were far more serious.The Ming, Bau, Wei and Liu clans have dominated the remote border town of Laukkaing in Myanmar's impoverished Shan state, since 2009.They rose to power after General Min Aung Hlaing, the current coup leader in Myanmar, led a military operation to drive out the MNDAA, the ethnic insurgent army which had dominated Laukkaing and the area around it since the 1980s.The four families, as they became known, took over and began shifting from the old dependence on opium and methamphetamine production to a new economy based on casinos and, eventually, online fraud.Chinese Ministry of Public SecurityMing Zhenzhen and Ming Guoping in the custody of Chinese policeThey remained close to the Myanmar military; in December 2021, after seizing power in his coup, Min Aung Hlaing feted Liu Zhengxiang, patriarch of the Liu clan, in the capital Nay Pyi Taw and awarded him an honorary title for \"extraordinary contributions to state development\".His Fully Light conglomerate had lucrative businesses all over Myanmar. Other members of the four families were candidates for the military-backed party the USDP.The scam compounds they ran in Laukkaing, though, were brutal, much more so than scam complexes in other parts of Asia. Torture was routine.Tens of thousands of mainly Chinese workers were lured there with promises of well-paid jobs, only to find themselves imprisoned in the compounds. They were forced to run elaborate \"pig-butchering\" scams, where most of the victims were also Chinese. Complaints from the victims, and by the families of those trapped in the compounds multiplied on social media.The most notorious compound in Laukkaing was called Crouching Tiger Villa, run by the Ming family. In October 2023, during what is believed to have been an escape attempt, the guards killed several Chinese nationals. The Chinese authorities felt compelled to take action.With China's apparent blessing the MNDAA and its allies attacked and recaptured Laukkaing, as part of their offensive against the Myanmar army in the ongoing civil war. The MNDAA vowed to stamp out the scam business completely.They detained the heads of the four families and handed more than 60 of their relatives and associates to the Chinese police. Ming Xuechang, the family patriarch, or warlord, killed himself after being captured, authorities said.Getty ImagesShe Zhijiang, who is accused of building an illicit gambling empire in South East Asia, was extradited to China last yearDuring interrogations by the Chinese police one of the family members is reported to have admitted killing someone chosen at random just to demonstrate his strength.These details have been publicised by China to justify its tough treatment of the families. Five of the Bau family are also awaiting execution, while the trials of the Wei and Liu families have not yet concluded.The four families are ethnic Chinese, and had close ties to the authorities on the Chinese side of the border in Yunnan. Their abuses were too close to home for China, and the action against the scam business in Laukkaing has been the most decisive yet.China has also prevailed on Thailand and Cambodia to extradite two Chinese business figures accused of running scam empires, She Zhijiang, who built an entire city in Myanmar's war-torn Karen State, and Chen Zhi, who amassed wealth and power with his Prince Group conglomerate in Cambodia. The Chinese government has also brought tens of thousands of its citizens who were working in scam compounds back to China to face trial.The scam business, though, has simply adapted and evolved. It is still thought to be by far the biggest business in Cambodia, despite pressure from China and the US on the government there to shut it down.And it has kept moving to new areas in Myanmar, even as the more prominent scam complexes like KK Park and Shwe Kokko, on the Thai-Myanmar border, have been forced to close down.",

    "body": "Healthcare, visas and whisky: What did UK and China get from Starmer's visit?1 day agoSuranjana TewariAsia Business CorrespondentGetty ImagesChina and the UK have called for a reset in economic relationsSir Keir Starmer's visit to China this week is the clearest sign yet the two countries are seeking to end the diplomatic \"ice age\" that has defined their relationship.Both leaders face economic pressures at home and are seeking new opportunities for trade and investment.For Sir Keir, the first UK prime minister to visit China since Theresa May in 2018, the trip was a chance to highlight the strength of British firms in finance, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, clean energy and car making.President Xi Jinping, meanwhile, aimed to show that China can be a reliable partner for Western economies, as US President Donald Trump continues to rattle the global trading system.Although no sweeping free trade deal was reached, the visit marked a cautious but tangible reset of UK–China economic ties.Agreements on visas, services, healthcare, green technology and finance, combined with revived dialogue, might lead to better access for British firms to Chinese markets and greater Chinese investment in the UK.What deals were agreed?The biggest commercial announcement came from AstraZeneca, which promised to invest $15bn (£11bn) in China over the next four years, to expand research and the manufacturing of medicines – the company's biggest investment in China to date.In the energy sector, British firm Octopus Energy is entering the Chinese market for the first time through a partnership with local company PCG Power to develop a digital platform for trading electricity.The project aims to improve efficiency in the power system and support China's efforts to increase the use of renewable energy.For Octopus, which has grown quickly in the UK, the deal allows entry into China's large and growing energy market, where demand for clean energy and digital trading is rising.Greg Jackson, CEO of Octopus Energy who was part of the UK's business delegation to China flagged that the country's scale and innovation have made solar, wind energy and batteries cheaper. \"Now there's a huge opportunity for Britain to succeed as we build the solutions that use these products to cut the cost of electricity,\" he added.China also agreed to halve tariffs on Scotch whisky, a deal the UK government said could generate £250m for the British economy over the next five years.\"Our whisky distilleries are the jewel in Scotland's crown,\" Sir Keir said. This is \"proof that our pragmatic, hard-headed international engagement brings benefits at home\", he added.Scotch whisky is a key export for Britain's drinks sector, with more than £5bn in annual exports. In recent years, China has been one of its fastest-growing markets.Industry groups welcomed the move, saying it would help Scottish distillers compete in a crowded market where US, European and Japanese firms are also vying for customers.Another outcome of the trip was visa-free travel for British citizens visiting China for up to 30 days for holidays and business, putting the UK on par with around 50 other countries, including France, Germany, Australia and Japan.Both sides also agreed to cooperate on disrupting migrant-smuggling networks, a top priority for Sir Keir's government. For Beijing, renewed ties with the UK - a major European economy and close US ally - signal that China remains a dependable partner for the West despite Trump's trade tensions.Economically, the reset secures access for Chinese exporters of high-value goods such as electric vehicles, solar panels and clean energy, while creating opportunities for Chinese investment in British services, finance and green tech.Chinese state media framed the visit as a step toward turning the \"potential of China–UK cooperation into real achievements that benefit both peoples and the world\".British firms were also quick to emphasise the benefits for both countries through the expanded partnerships.\"The prime minister's visit, the first in eight years, is a significant moment, signalling the importance of the economic relationship between the UK and China,\" Chris Fitzgerald, group director for international affairs at Octopus Energy told the BBC from China.\"Such partnerships mean we can bring affordable, secure, clean energy to British customers... And we can use our technology and know-how to bring some of the same benefits to Chinese customers.\"What challenges remain?Foreign businesses have long complained about the difficulties of doing business in China, flagging red tape, complex regulations, and a lack of transparency.These can complicate investment decisions and create uncertainty for companies.\"Any market has its own challenges, so of course we've got to be clear eyed and seek expert advice,\" Fitzgerald said.\"We have had good discussions with the Chinese officials who have welcomed our entry. And we have been careful to choose an excellent partner... So we are excited to take the immense opportunity that the world's largest renewable energy market offers.\"Sir Keir's Labour government has struggled to deliver the economic growth it promised, making the China visit a high-stakes test.Despite scrutiny at home, improving relations with the world's second-largest economy has been a priority for the British prime minister.The move, however, requires a delicate diplomatic balancing act.US President Trump recently warned that Canada could face 100% tariffs over deals struck with China during Mark Carney's visit, and he has warned the UK about deepening its commercial ties with Beijing.Sir Keir has insisted that Britain does not need to choose between Washington and Beijing, framing the reset as a pragmatic way to support growth at home while managing geopolitical risk.At the UK–China Business Forum in Beijing on Friday, he described meetings with Xi as \"very warm\" and highlighted the significance of agreements on visa-free travel and whisky tariffs.These offer British firms \"really important access\" and are \"symbolic of what we're doing with the relationship\", he said. \"That is the way that we build the mutual trust and respect that is so important.\"Sir Keir's visit is one of a flurry of trips to Beijing, as leaders from France, Canada and Finland seek to hedge against an increasingly unpredictable United States.With Washington pursuing aggressive tariff policies and even making threats over Greenland, these so-called middle powers are looking to diversify trade and investment partners while securing new markets.At the same time, these countries will be watching closely the deals that the UK, Canada, France and others are striking with China.They will all need to remain competitive in attracting Chinese investment and accessing the world's second largest economy.",

    "body": "24 hours agoMaia DaviesandImogen Foulkes,Geneva correspondentGetty ImagesAntónio Guterres said the organisation's money could run out by JulyThe United Nations is at risk of \"imminent financial collapse\" due to member states not paying their fees, the body's head has warned.António Guterres said the UN faced a financial crisis which was \"deepening, threatening programme delivery\", and that money could run out by July.He wrote in a letter to all 193 member states that they had to honour their mandatory payments or overhaul the organisation's financial rules to avoid collapse.It comes after the UN's largest contributor, the US, refused to contribute to its regular and peacekeeping budgets, and withdrew from several agencies it called a \"waste of taxpayer dollars\". Several other members are in arrears or are simply refusing to pay.Though the UN General Assembly did approve a partial change to its financial system in late 2025, the organisation still faces a massive cash crisis compounded by a rule that means it is refunding money it never received.At its headquarters in Geneva, signs warning of the situation have been put up everywhere. In an almost desperate attempt to save cash, the escalators are regularly turned off and the heating turned down.Guterres wrote in his letter that the UN had faced financial crises in the past but that the current situation was \"categorically different\".\"Decisions not to honour assessed contributions that finance a significant share of the approved regular budget have now been formally announced,\" the secretary general said, without naming specific members.He said the \"integrity of the entire system\" depended on states adhering to their obligation under the UN charter to pay their \"assessed contributions\" - adding that 77% of the total owed had been paid in 2025, leaving a record amount unpaid.Guterres said a rule that the UN must return unspent money on particular programmes to members if it could not implement a budget created a \"double blow\" in which it was \"expected to give back cash that does not exist\".\"I cannot overstate the urgency of the situation we now face. We cannot execute budgets with uncollected funds, nor return funds we never received.\"As a result, the UN is now returning millions of dollars it never actually had. The letter reads: \"Just this month, as part of the 2026 assessment, we were compelled to return $227m [£165m]  – funds we have not collected.\"\"The bottom line is clear,\" Guterres wrote. \"Either all member states honour their obligations to pay in full and on time – or member states must fundamentally overhaul our financial rules to prevent an imminent financial collapse.\"UN agencies rarely get all the money they ask for to tackle humanitarian crises, but the past 12 months have been particularly difficult. The US is the UN's largest contributor, but President Donald Trump has said it was not fulfilling its \"great potential\" and has criticised it for failing to support US-led peace efforts.The US did not pay its contribution to the UN's regular budget in 2025 and offered only 30% of its expected funding to UN peacekeeping operations.Other countries, such as the UK and Germany, have also announced significant reductions in foreign aid, which will inevitably impact the UN's work.Guterres had warned earlier that same month that the UN faced its most fragile financial position in years - again citing unpaid fees - having said in October that it faced a \"race to bankruptcy\".Trump has separately been accused by critics of seeking to replace some functions of the UN with his Board of Peace to oversee regeneration efforts in Gaza.The US president has said its work would happen \"in conjunction with the United Nations\" - but when previously asked by a Fox TV journalist whether the board would take the UN's place, he replied: \"Well, it might.\"The US officially left the UN's World Health Organization last week. It had refused to pay its 2024 and 2025 dues despite, WHO lawyers say, being legally obliged to do so.Other agencies are also making huge cuts. The UN's human rights office has warned that serious violations will now go undocumented because it lacks the funds to deploy investigators. In the past, their evidence has led to prosecutions for war crimes and crimes against humanity.In Afghanistan, which has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the world, UN Women has had to close mother and baby clinics. Meanwhile, the World Food Programme has had to cut rations to refugees fleeing the conflict in Sudan.",

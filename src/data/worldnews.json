    "body": "President Donald Trump said he had an MRI scan during a recent visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. \"I did. I got an MRI. It was perfect,\" the president told reporters on board Air Force One on Monday on his way to a week-long trip in Asia. Trump, who at age 79 is one of the oldest presidents in US history, did not say why he got the scan, which can be used to check for a wide range of issues. The scan took place during Trump's visit to Walter Reed earlier this month, when his  physician said he was in \"exceptional health\".\"The doctor said [it] was some of the best reports, for the age, they've ever seen,\" Trump said Monday.Asked why he received the MRI, which stands for magnetic resonance imaging, Trump told reporters to \"ask the doctors\".Presidential physician Dr Sean Barbabella said in a statement at the time that Trump's appointment was a \"scheduled follow-up evaluation\" \"as part of his ongoing health maintenance plan and included advanced imaging, laboratory testing, and preventative health assessments\".The president \"continues to demonstrate excellent overall health\", Dr Barbabella said. MRI scans use strong magnetic fields to create an image of the inside of a patient's body, and is especially useful for looking at soft tissues, according to the US National Institutes of Health (NIH).Earlier this year, the White House announced that Trump had been diagnosed with a medical condition in his veins called chronic venous insufficiency.Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump had noticed swelling in his legs, prompting a check-up with his doctor who diagnosed him with the condition.Chronic venous insufficiency occurs when leg veins don't allow blood to flow back up to the heart, causing it to pool in the lower limbs. It is a \"benign and common\", in older individuals, according to a note from Barbabella.Trump had also been recently photographed with patches of makeup on the back of his hand. The White House has said it is unrelated to the vein condition but is instead bruising as a result of frequent handshaking.",

    "body": "9 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseUS President Donald Trump has not ruled out the possibility of seeking a third term for the White House, saying he would \"love to do it\". But Trump rejected the possibility of running for vice-president in 2028 - an idea floated by some supporters as a way for him to circumvent the US constitution that bars the president from running for a third term.Speaking to reporters during his trip to Asia, Trump described the idea as \"too cute\" and said it \"wouldn't be right\". It is unclear what method he would use to run again. Last week, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon said that a \"plan\" was in place to secure the 79-year-old president another term. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Japan from Malaysia, Trump said that while he would \"be allowed\" to run again as vice-president, he had no plans to do so.\"I think people wouldn't like that,\" he said. \"It's too cute. It wouldn't be right.\" Talking about the possibility of a third term, Trump said: \"I haven't really thought about it. But I have the best poll numbers that I've ever had.\" Additionally, Trump also suggested vice-president JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as potential successors, calling them \"unstoppable\".\"All I can tell you is that we have a great group of people, which they don't,\" he added, referring to Democrats.Can Trump serve a third term as US president?The 22nd amendment of the US constitution bars presidents from seeking a third term. Repealing the amendment would require approval from two-thirds of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, and then ratification by 38 of the 50 state legislatures - a process viewed as highly unlikely.Last week, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon - who remains a vocal supporter - claimed there was a \"plan\" to secure a third term for Trump.\"Trump is going to be president in '28, and people ought to just get accommodated with that,\" Bannon told  The Economist. \"At the appropriate time, we'll lay out what the plan is.\" In March, Trump told CNBC he would \"probably not\" run again, though he later said  he was \"not joking\" about the possibility. It is still unclear which Democrats intend to run for the White House in 2028, although several have already expressed an interest. On Sunday, California Governor Gavin Newsom told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that  he would \"be lying\" if he said he was not giving serious thought to a presidential bid. Former vice-president Kamala Harris also told the BBC she may run again and that she could \"possibly\" be president in the future. ",

    "body": "14 hours agoKathryn Armstrong and Natasha BootyReutersPaul Biya, 92, posts his ballot as his wife Chantal, 54, watches onCameroon's 92-year-old president has won a controversial eighth term, in a fiercely disputed election.Paul Biya, who is the world's oldest head of state, won 53.7% of the vote, compared to the 35.2% of opposition leader Issa Tchiroma Bakary, the Constitutional Council declared.Before the announcement, Tchiroma Bakary -  a former Biya ally - insisted he had won the election, but the ruling Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM) dismissed his claim.The election, held on 12 October, has been marred with deadly violence, and in recent days, hundreds of Tchiroma Bakary's supporters have defied protest bans in several cities, and clashed with security forces.Biya thanked voters for \"once again\" trusting him.\"I sincerely hope that, together, we resolutely undertake to build a peaceful, united and prosperous Cameroon,\" he said in a statement.On Sunday, at least four people were killed during protests in Cameroon's economic capital of Douala.The regional governor, Samuel Dieudonné Diboua, said police posts had come under attack and security forces had defended themselves.The unrest continued on Monday, when a number of people were shot dead near  Tchiroma Bakary's residence in the city of Garoua, a local journalist on the scene told the BBC.Around the same time, the opposition leader wrote on Facebook that shots were being fired at civilians gathered outside his home. He later claimed that snipers had been stationed at the house across from his, and were \"firing at point-blank range at the people\".The authorities have not yet commented on these reports.Protesters were denouncing what they said was a plan by the ruling CPDM, to \"steal the victory\" from Tchiroma Bakary.The situation is so tense in the capital, Yaoundé, that almost all shops and schools have remained closed, while most civil servants and office workers stayed home.ReutersSupporters of Issa Tchiroma Bakary have clashed with security forces in recent daysIn total, 10 candidates were in the running for the presidential office, including former Prime Minister Bello Bouba Maigari.Voter turnout was 58%.At least 10 petitions alleging electoral malpractice have been rejected by the Constitutional Council.Residents in Yaoundé have been voicing their opinions on Biya's controversial victory.\"We are at the beginning of another nightmare,\" Amungwa Nicodemus told the BBC.\"The economy is declining, corruption is endemic, a lot of things are going wrong.\"Another resident, Abolo Denis, urged Cameroonians to accept the result, saying that peace is of the utmost importance.\"What struck me first, after the proclamation of the results, was the silence - graveyard silence,\" said Vivian Muma, in the northern city of Bamenda. \"The silence tells it all. Cameroonian people decided, but those who [make] the decisions, they decided otherwise,\" she said.MARCO LONGARI/AFP via Getty ImagesSupporters of Issa Tchiroma Bakary allege the ruling CPDM had a plan to \"steal the victory\" from the opposition leaderThe governing party has hailed Biya's victory \"under the sign of greatness and hope\" in online posts.Biya, who came to power in 1982, is rarely seen in public and is known for spending time outside Africa in Swiss hotels. These long absences coupled with his advanced age has, in the past, led to rumours he was dead.While his leadership has been praised for the expansion of schools and public universities, and his handling of the Bakassi dispute - which saw the oil-rich peninsula handed to Cameroon instead of Nigeria - his tenure has also faced criticisms. A violent separatist insurgency in the English-speaking west has been running for almost a decade, unemployment stands at 40% for the under-35s, roads and hospitals are crumbling, and freedom of speech has been limited.Analysts have warned in recent days that Cameroon, a once peaceful country, could descend into political turmoil if the election results did not reflect the will of the people.\"Biya now has a notably shaky mandate given many of his own citizens don't believe he won the election,\" Murithi Mutiga, Africa Program Director at the International Crisis Group, said in a statement.\"We call on Biya to urgently initiate a national mediation to prevent further escalation,\" he added.More on the Cameroon election",

    "body": "8 hours agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology Correspondent, San FranciscoOpenAI has released new estimates of the number of ChatGPT users who exhibit possible signs of mental health emergencies, including mania, psychosis or suicidal thoughts.The company said that around 0.07% of ChatGPT users active in a given week exhibited such signs, adding that its artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot recognizes and responds to these sensitive conversations.While OpenAI maintains these cases are \"extremely rare,\" critics said even a small percentage may amount to hundreds of thousands of people, as ChatGPT recently reached 800 million weekly active users, per boss Sam Altman.As scrutiny mounts, the company said it built a network of experts around the world to advise it.Those experts include more than 170 psychiatrists, psychologists, and primary care physicians who have practiced in 60 countries, the company said.They have devised a series of responses in ChatGPT to encourage users to seek help in the real world, according to OpenAI.But the glimpse at the company's data raised eyebrows among some mental health professionals.\"Even though 0.07% sounds like a small percentage, at a population level with hundreds of millions of users, that actually can be quite a few people,\" said Dr. Jason Nagata, a professor who studies technology use among young adults at the University of California, San Francisco.\"AI can broaden access to mental health support, and in some ways support mental health, but we have to be aware of the limitations,\" Dr. Nagata added.The company also estimates 0.15% of ChatGPT users have conversations that include \"explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.\"OpenAI said recent updates to its chatbot are designed to \"respond safely and empathetically to potential signs of delusion or mania\" and note \"indirect signals of potential self-harm or suicide risk.\"ChatGPT has also been trained to reroute sensitive conversations \"originating from other models to safer models\" by opening in a new window.In response to questions by the BBC on criticism about the numbers of people potentially affected, OpenAI said that this small percentage of users amounts to a meaningful amount of people and noted they are taking changes seriously. The changes come as OpenAI faces mounting legal scrutiny over the way ChatGPT interacts with users.In one of the most high-profile lawsuits recently filed against OpenAI, a California couple sued the company over the death of their teenage son alleging that ChatGPT encouraged him to take his own life in April.The lawsuit was filed by the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine and was the first legal action accusing OpenAI of wrongful death.In a separate case, the suspect in a murder-suicide that took place in August in Greenwich, Connecticut posted hours of his conversations with ChatGPT, which appear to have fuelled the alleged perpetrator's delusions.More users struggle with AI psychosis as \"chatbots create the illusion of reality,\" said Professor Robin Feldman, Director of the AI Law & Innovation Institute at the University of California Law. \"It is a powerful illusion.\"She said OpenAI deserved credit for \"sharing statistics and for efforts to improve the problem\" but added: \"the company can put all kinds of warnings on the screen but a person who is mentally at risk may not be able to heed those warnings.\" ",

    "body": "The Indian village which saw the  homecoming of one of the world's oldest rebels8 hours agoSoutik BiswasIndia correspondentAPAfter more than 60 years, Thuingaleng Muivah returned to his native village in Manipur last weekLast week, a helicopter appeared over the green, folded hills of Ukhrul in India's north-eastern state of Manipur.By the time it touched down on a makeshift helipad outside Somdal village, the crowd had already begun to sing. When the door opened, the crowd surged towards a frail man in dark glasses and a black suit. Quickly, they draped him in a traditional shawl.After more than half a century, Thuingaleng Muivah, India's oldest rebel, had come home.  Now 91, Mr Muivah is the general secretary of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah), or NSCN (I-M), the most powerful of the Naga insurgent factions that once fought the Indian state in one of Asia's longest-running rebellions - though today the organisation is often regarded as a shadow of its former self.His supporters see him as the keeper of a demand India has never recognised - a separate state for Naga people. His critics remember something else: a movement accused of targeted killings and running a parallel government in Nagaland through \"taxes\" many call extortion - allegations the NSCN (I-M) denies.Nagaland, a largely Christian state wedged between Myanmar and Bangladesh, is home to a people spread across neighbouring Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam states. Muivah seeks either full sovereignty or a \"Greater Nagaland\" uniting Nagas across borders, especially in Manipur.Muivah himself was born in what is now Manipur state  - a reminder that the Naga identity extends far beyond Nagaland's borders.This was his second attempt to return home - the first, in 2010, was blocked by the Manipur government, which cited the risk of unrest and security concerns. When he finally made it back with his wife last week, almost the entire village gathered to welcome the Avakharar - the \"eldest father\", as they called him. Among them was his only surviving sibling, 84-year-old Asui Muivah.\"Generation comes and goes, but the nation stays,\" he wrote in a message read aloud by his deputy, VS Atem, as he was too weak to speak himself. \"The issue we are fighting for is greater and older than most of us.\"APHundreds had gathered to welcome Muivah, the general secretary of the most powerful Naga insurgent faction called NSCN (I-M)Muivah had left this same hillside village in 1964, trekking east to join the Naga struggle for sovereignty - a journey that would take him to the jungles of northern Myanmar, the ideological camps of Maoist China and the negotiation tables of Delhi. After coming out of the jungles for a ceasefire in 1997, Muivah has lived in Delhi and a sprawling camp in Hebron in Nagaland, which serves as the NSCN (I-M)'s headquarters, complete with signs declaring, \"Freedom is the birthright of all nations\". \"His return to his village is more personal than political - driven by a longing for home. His calls for a separate Naga flag and a constitution are expected, and they help keep him politically relevant. But the broader idea of 'Greater Nagaland' has largely faded over the years,\" says Pradip Phanjoubam, editor-in-chief of the Imphal Review of Arts and Politics.The Naga struggle predates India itself. In 1918, returning World War One labourers formed the Naga Club to assert a distinct identity. When India became independent in 1947, Naga leaders refused to join the new republic, declaring, \"We are not Indians\", and held their own unrecognised plebiscite for independence in 1951.As armed conflict began to intensify, the Indian government sent in troops in 1955. What followed was decades of insurgency, factional splits and ceasefires. The rebellion claimed thousands of lives, displaced generations and militarised the lush, Christian-majority hills. \"The Naga conflict,\" says political scientist Sanjib Baruah, \"is among the world's least-known but longest-running armed movements.\"Muivah was born in March 1935 in Somdal, where his family often went hungry. Educated at a local Christian school, he was drawn early to the ideas of revolution and Naga nationalism. By his teens, Muivah was already a Naga nationalist, singing \"God Bless My Nagaland\" at school and questioning why his people lived in \"humiliation\" under the colonial government. After studying at St Anthony's College in Shillong and reading Marx, Hegel and Rousseau, he joined the Naga National Council (NNC) - the first political organisation of the Nagas to demand independence from India - in 1964.APPeople waved the Naga flag - the symbol of an unfulfilled political dream - as they waited for Muivah's arrival last weekTwo years later, 31-year-old Muivah joined more than 130 guerrillas on a 97-day trek through the jungles of northern Myanmar to China's Yunnan province. \"We carried our own rice and slept on grass in clearings,\" he said in a 1998 interview. \"I could stand the hunger, but sometimes there was no water to drink.\" They crossed rivers on bamboo rafts hacked through thick undergrowth, and trudged on in subzero cold. Beijing trained the rebels in guerrilla warfare, Marxist-Leninist theory and \"people's war\". Muivah studied briefly in Beijing's College of Diplomacy, visited Vietnam and came back speaking reverently of Mao and Zhou Enlai - though he would later fuse their ideology with a deeply Christian nationalism. He returned to Nagaland after five years.In 1980, Muivah and his comrades Isak Chishi Swu and SS Khaplang founded the NSCN, breaking away from the older NNC that had signed a controversial peace accord with Delhi. Their faction later split again - into the NSCN (I-M) and NSCN (K), led by Khaplang of Myanmar - spawning smaller offshoots across the northeast. At its height, the NSCN (I-M) was the mother of all insurgencies in the region, training and arming smaller ethnic groups and running what India's intelligence agencies called a \"shadow state\" across the hills, according to Subir Bhaumik, a veteran chronicler of the region. The group faced accusations of extortion, killings and human rights abuses.Critics within the Naga insurgency also point to a violent legacy. The Zeliangrong United Front (ZUF) has accused Muivah of ordering \"merciless killings of many prominent leaders\" and carrying out arson in villages \"in the name of taxation or fighting the Indian Army,\" leaving \"common Nagas\" to bear the cost, its spokesperson Louis Gangmei said.Over the years, Muivah transformed from jungle commissar to political negotiator. After decades of exile - in Thailand, the Netherlands and the borderlands of Myanmar -  he entered a ceasefire with India.But his demand for a separate Naga flag and constitution remains a stumbling block. In a interview in 2020, Muivah told journalist Karan Thapar: \"The Nagas will never be part of the Indian Union, nor accept its constitution. There can be no solution without our flag and our constitution.\"The Indian government has offered greater autonomy, but rejects any concession implying sovereignty; the 2015 Framework Agreement, once hailed as a breakthrough, now languishes. \"We have not surrendered our free existence and sovereignty ,\" Muivah declared last week. \"Come what may, we shall defend it to the last.\" APArmed cadres of Muivah's group kept guard as they waited for his arrivalYet over the past decade, as Muivah's health declined and the movement splintered into dozens of factions, the NSCN (I-M)'s once-formidable influence has waned. A younger generation of Nagas, weary of blockades and extortion, now increasingly seeks peace and economic stability. At the same time, experts like Prof Baruah say that the \"proud display of Naga flags in his home village testifies to the vitality and resilience of the Naga movement\"  - a reminder that while its horizons may have narrowed, the sentiment endures.More importantly, he adds, \"even objectively strong states can choose live-and-let-live deals with armed groups rather than trying to disarm and demobilise them\".Muivah says his group has held more than 600 rounds of talks with New Delhi on a Naga homeland since the late 1990s. Yet critics remain unsparing. The Manipur-based ZUF dismissed his return as \"empty-handed,\" arguing there is \"no reason to glorify an individual who failed the Nagas on all fronts.\" Supporters believe he is war-weary, unsure of peace, and still waiting for the political settlement that has defined his life's struggle.As early as 2006, he told Mr Bhaumik, the journalist, \"I am very tired. I feel doubly tired because there seems to be no result coming out of the talks.\" The wait goes on.Additional reporting by Abhishek Dey",

    "body": "Two people have been killed in an underground explosion at a mine in the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW), the first such incident of its kind since 2015.Emergency services were called to the Endeavor mine at Cobar, about 700km (435 miles) northwest of Sydney, in the early hours of Tuesday after reports two people had been critically injured.Police said a man, in his 60s, was confirmed dead at the scene and two women, both in their 20s, were brought to the surface, but one later died. The second woman was airlifted to hospital for minor injuries and shock.Polymetals Resources, which bought the Endeavour mine in 2023, said all operations at the site had been temporarily suspended.It did not say what caused the explosion. The company's executive chairman Dave Sproule said it was \"shocked and saddened by the tragic incident\" and \"our deepest thoughts and condolences go out to the employee's families, friends and colleagues\".Fatalities from mine explosions are rare in Australia, with the most recent death happening in 2015 at a mine in Queensland according to Safe Work Australia.Cobar Mayor Jarrod Marsden said it was an \"absolutely tragic\" situation.\"The most valuable thing to come out of a mine are the miners, and two families don't get to see their loved ones anymore,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).\"Cobar is a small mining community, it's very tight-knit, and I'm sure everyone's going to be thinking of their families today.\"A report will be prepared for the coroner and an investigation into the incident will be carried out by the state's workplace safety authority.According to the Endeavour mine's website, it had been operating continuously from 1982 to 2020 and the new owners were in the process of restarting mining activities for silver, zinc and lead metal production this year. The mine includes a 7km (4.3 miles) decline and 300m shaft, the site said.NSW Premier Chris Minns extended his condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of the workers who died.\"This is a heartbreaking day for the Cobar community and will be felt across the entire mining industry,\" he said. Safety protocols and procedures have \"greatly improved in mining\", Minns said, but the two deaths were a \"sobering reminder of why we need to always remain vigilant to protect workers\".",

He had met the girl on Facebook and travelled to England from Amsterdam before raping her in her home in 2014.Two weeks ago, South Australia's Attorney-General Kyam Maher wrote to the federal government, calling on authorities to reject his visa as his crimes were \"utterly abhorrent\".The letter also said \"we do not believe that foreign child sex offenders should be granted entry to this country\".Australia's Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the government will \"continue to use every tool we have available to ensure that Australians can be safe and feel safe in their communities\".After the rape in 2014, Van de Velde returned to the Netherlands but in 2016, he was extradited to the UK and arrested. Ahead of his sentencing, the court heard he was aware of the girl's age.He served 12 months of his four-year sentence and restarted his professional sporting career in 2018, playing for his national team in several global tournaments.Last year, he represented the Netherlands at the Paris Olympics and was booed by some people in the crowd. Earlier, an online petition calling for him to be banned from the Olympics had attracted 90,000 signatures.The BBC has contacted the organisers of the world championship event in South Australia and the Dutch national volleyball association for comment.

    "body": "Who is Anwar Ibrahim, the Malaysian leader who helped Trump preside over a 'peace deal'?8 hours agoKelly NgSingaporeGetty ImagesPresident Donald Trump is greeted by Malaysian PM Anwar when he arrives in Kuala Lumpur in October 2025\"I was in prison but you almost got there,\" Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim joked to US President Donald Trump as the cameras rolled.It was a dicey joke - one he quickly moved on from given Trump's less-than amused demeanour - but also arguably one only a veteran politician basking in his recent wins would dare make.He had just signed a deal with Trump to lower tariffs on Malaysian exports to the US from 24% to 19%. Although many other details remain unclear, any assurance that levies will not rise further is welcome amid all the uncertainty. But most important of all, Anwar had secured Trump's attendance at a regional summit whose relevance has been repeatedly questioned. The US president was at the meeting of Association of South East Asian Nations, or Asean, in Kuala Lumpur solely to preside over a highly publicised \"peace deal\" between Thailand and Cambodia, which Anwar orchestrated. He also brokered the fragile ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia after deadly border clashes earlier this year - he stepped in after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on both sides if the fighting didn't stop. Some called it a diplomatic victory for Malaysia, while others said Anwar was simply in the right place at the right time - this year, it was the Malaysian PM's turn to lead Asean. But Anwar would argue he waited 25 years for his turn - a turbulent time in the wings, during which he was jailed twice. Tumultuous path to powerAnwar first made his name as a charismatic firebrand student leader who founded Malaysia's Islamic youth movement, ABIM.In 1982, he joined the long-ruling party United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), surprising many who had expected him to steer clear of the establishment.But it proved a canny political move - he climbed up the ladder rapidly and held multiple ministerial posts.Getty ImagesAnwar Ibrahim has for decades waited in the wings to lead MalaysiaIn 1993, he became deputy to then-prime minister Mahathir Mohamad and was widely seen as his heir-apparent. That was until they fell out over the handling of the Asian financial crisis in 1997, which hit Malaysia hard. Anwar was sacked the next year, then jailed for sodomy and corruption - charges he denies to this day, arguing they were part of a smear campaign to remove him as a political threat.In 2004, a year after Mahathir stepped down, Malaysia's Supreme Court overturned the sodomy conviction and freed Anwar. He emerged as the leader of an invigorated opposition, leading it to its strongest-ever performance in the 2013 elections.Less than a year later, while preparing to fight a state election, new sodomy charges were filed against him, sending him back to jail.Getty ImagesAnwar (L) and Mahathir during the 2018 election campaign Then in 2016, in a shock turn of events, Mahathir came out of retirement to run for top office, as then-leader Najib Razak faced  corruption allegations.Mahathir, then 92, struck an unlikely deal with the still-imprisoned Anwar, where he promised to free Anwar if elected, and eventually hand over the PM job to him. Their coalition scored a historic victory in 2018, but the alliance began to unravel as the nonagenarian kept shifting the goalposts for handing over power.In the 2022 election, Anwar's coalition won the most seats but still fell short of the number needed to form a government. After days of deadlock, the king appointed him PM.Some thought his term would be short-lived. But nearly three years on, the 78-year-old has already held on to the job for longer than his three predecessors.Stable but polarisedAnwar's biggest achievement is perhaps the political stability he appears to have brought to a country that has cycled through three prime ministers between 2020 and 2021.\"Malaysia these days is sometimes seen as among the most stable in South East Asia... which has also made it relatively attractive for investors,\" says Syaza Shukri, a political science professor at the International Islamic University Malaysia.But cost of living is rising, as it is in so many other countries. In July, 20,000 protesters took to the streets in Kuala Lumpur demanding Anwar's resignation, over rising costs and a lack of economic reforms.And expensive investments in semiconductor manufacturing and data centres are yet to pay off. That's why the tariff deal with the US was crucial for the export-driven economy. Others accuse his administration of not doing enough to promote a more inclusive Malaysia in the face of rising Islamism. Religious outrage has sometimes spilled into violence in the Muslim-majoirty country, which also has a sizeable ethnic Chinese population. In 2024, a convenience store chain sparked an outcry for selling socks printed with the word \"Allah\" – the Arabic word for God – which many Muslims saw as an insult to Islam. The store was attacked with Molotov cocktail attacks as people called for it to be boycotted and for the company's executives to be charged.Getty ImagesFrustrated with the rising cost of living and lack of reforms, 20,000 protesters took to the streets in July to demand Anwar's resignationIn 2023, a Chinese Muslim restaurant had to publicly apologise after it came under fire over a staff member wearing a crucifix necklace.\"The middle ground for Malaysian politics is no longer a tolerant multiracial Malaysia, but a conservative Malaysia with an Islamic outlook... Anwar's position on political Islam may just move the country to unchartered territory,\" professor of Asian studies James Chin wrote in a commentary published by CNA.Critics also accuse Anwar of favouritism and question his anti-corruption pledges -  in a contentious move, public prosecutors dropped 47 corruption charges in 2023 against a key Anwar ally, the deputy PM.The diplomatic danceInternationally, Anwar has been more successful. As prime minister, he has a deft balancing act ahead to make sure the emerging, economy he is in charge of doesn't get caught between the US and China.He had also invited China's leader Xi Jinping to the summit. Xi had made an official visit to Malaysia in April, after a 12-year gap, but he skipped this week's summit. But Trump's presence was no small thing for South East Asian economies that rely on the US market. It meant other countries, like Thailand and Vietnam, could also discuss details and gain assurances on tariffs - which they would count as a win, for now.    Anwar has been very active on the diplomatic front. Within his first year as PM, he visited all Asean countries, apart from Myanmar, where a civil war has been raging since the army seized power in 2021.It has been one of Asean's most intractable challenges - while Anwar has been praised for speaking up more on the issue, little has changed on the ground, partly because China has the most influence over the military junta. Still, Professor Chin believes Anwar has \"moved the needle a little\" in restoring Asean's relevance.His role in the Thailand-Cambodia ceasefire also boosted Anwar's standing, but these diplomatic wins mean little to ordinary Malaysians.ReutersAnwar (centre), Cambodia's PM Hun Manet (left) and Thailand's acting PM Phumtham Wechayachai attended peace talks in Kuala Lumpur in JulyWhat's resonated at home is his advocacy for the Palestinian cause, which has become louder since the war in Gaza began in 2023.  \"Anwar needs to fly the Palestinian flag to the hilt to satisfy public opinion and fortify himself against attacks from opponents who accuse him of not going far enough,\" says Ariel Tan, coordinator of the Malaysia programme at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies.But Anwar also faces a dilemma because he needs to maintain good ties with Washington, Israel's most powerful ally, Ms Tan says.\"Since Trump's re-election, he has reduced his criticism of the United States' role in the conflict. Engaging the US has become more critical, particularly with the tariff threat.\"The question is, will Anwar be able to balance the demands at home with those abroad, and start to replicate his international success on a local stage?The answer to that will be crucial to his survival in the next election, due in 2028.",

    "body": "The 92-year-old president who never loses6 hours agoPaul MellyAfrica analystReutersTo absolutely no one's surprise, Cameroon's Constitutional Council has proclaimed the re-election of 92-year old President Paul Biya, the world's oldest head of state, for an eighth successive term.Amid rumours of a close result and claims of victory by his main challenger, former government minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary, excitement and tension had been building in the run-up to Monday's declaration.The official outcome, victory for Biya with 53.7%, ahead of Tchiroma Bakary on 35.2%, came as both a shock and yet, for many Cameroonians, an anti-climax.Biya's decision to stand for another seven-year mandate, after 43 years in power, was inevitably contentious,. Not only because of his longevity in power, but also because his style of governance has raised questions.Extended stays abroad, habitually at the Intercontinental Hotel in Geneva or alternative more discreet locations around the Swiss lakeside city, have repeatedly triggered speculation about the extent to which he is actually governing Cameroon - or whether most decisions are in fact taken by the prime minister and ministers or the influential secretary general of the presidency, Ferdinand Ngoh Ngoh.Last year, after making a speech at a Second World War commemoration in the South of France in August and attending the China Africa summit in Beijing the next month, the president disappeared from view for almost six weeks without any announcement or explanation, sparking speculation about his health.Even after senior officials appeared to indicate that he was, once again, in Geneva, reportedly working as usual, there was no real news until the announcement of his impending return home to the capital, Yaoundé, where he was filmed being greeted by supporters.And this year it was not really a surprise when he squeezed a further pre-election visit to Geneva into his schedule just weeks before polling day.Biya's inscrutable style of national leadership, rarely calling formal meetings of the full cabinet or publicly addressing complex issues, leaves a cloud of uncertainty over the goals of his administration and the formation of government policy.At a technical level, capable ministers and officials pursue a wide range of initiatives and programmes. But the political vision and sense of direction has been largely absent.ReutersOpposition supporters say that Biya's victory was riggedHis regime has shown itself sporadically willing to crack down on protest or detain more vocal critics. But that is not the only or perhaps even the most important factor that has kept him in power.For it has to be said that Biya has also fulfilled a distinctive political role.He has acted as a balancing figure in what is a complex country, marked by large social, regional and linguistic differences - between, for example, the equatorial south and the savannah north, or the majority of regions that are French-speaking and the English-speaking North-West and South-West, with their different educational and institutional traditions.In a state whose early post-independence years were marked by debates over federalism and tensions over the form that national unity should take, he has assembled governments that include representatives of a wide range of backgrounds.Albeit sometimes under pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and international creditors, his administrations have averted debt disaster and, in recent years, gradually consolidated national finances.Moreover, the past decade or so has seen Biya appear increasingly almost like a constitutional monarch, a symbolic figure who may decide a few key issues but leaves others to set the course on most policy areas.And his continuation in this role has been facilitated by the competitive rivalries between senior figures in the ruling Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM). While he is there, the succession does not have to be decided.However, with no designated or preferred political heir apparent, and with some one-time \"next generation\" CPDM figures themselves now getting on in years, Biya's perpetuation in office has fuelled a constantly turning rumour mill about the succession.Increasingly, the name of his son Franck has been cited, even though he shows little interest in politics or government.Meanwhile, there is no shortage of either development or security challenges for the president despite Cameroon's rich natural resource diversity.Is it possible that today we are seeing a decisive erosion in popular tolerance of Biya's self-effacing version of semi-authoritarian rule?Are Cameroonians tiring of a system that offers them multi-party electoral expression but little hope of actually changing their rulers?Has the bloody crisis in the English-speaking regions exposed the limits of the president's cautious and distant approach?When protests demanding reform first erupted there in 2016 Biya was slow to respond. By the time he did offer meaningful change and a national dialogue, the momentum of violence had accelerated, eroding the space for real compromise.Meanwhile, so low-key in style, he has failed to really sell an economic and social development vision for Cameroon or instil a sense of progress towards a goal.AFP via Getty ImagesPresident Biya faced a strong challenge from his former ally, Issa Tchiroma BakaryBiya was already testing the limits of popular tolerance with his decision to stand for a seventh successive term in 2018.But ultimately he managed to face down a strong opposition challenge from Maurice Kamto, leader of the Cameroon Renaissance Movement (CRM) - and when Kamto disputed the official results awarding him only 14% of the vote, he was detained for more than eight months.But this time around, Tchiroma's candidacy shifted the mood and sense of possibility in a way that no previous challenger has managed, at least since 1992, when even official results credited John Fru Ndi, of the Social Democratic front (SDF), with 36% of the vote, only just behind Biya on 40%.And this time it is not just that Biya is seven years older and even more hands-off than before.It is also that, in contrast to Kamto - who struggled to reach far beyond his core electorate - Tchiroma, a Muslim northerner, has attracted support from a wide cross section of society and of Cameroon's regions, notably including the two anglophone regions.This one-time political prisoner who later compromised with Biya and accepted a ministerial post, had the guts to go to Bamenda, the largest English-speaking city, and apologise for his role in the government's actions.And over recent days, as tensions grew in the run-up to the result declaration, Tchiroma shrewdly stayed in Garoua, his home city in the north, where crowds of young supporters had gathered to shield him from the risk of arrest by the security forces.Now, after expectations that had built so high, there is intense frustration and anger among opposition supporters at the official result, however expected it may have been.The security forces were already reported to have shot protesters in Douala, the southern port city that is the hub of the economy. And shooting has now been reported from Garoua too.For Cameroon, Biya's determination to secure an eighth presidential term has brought high risks and painful costs.Paul Melly is a consulting fellow with the Africa Programme at Chatham House in London.You may also be interested in:From government spin doctor to Cameroon president's main rivalSocial media revamp by 92-year-old presidentAre Africa's leaders too old to govern the young?Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Israel has received, through the Red Cross, a coffin that Hamas says contains the body of another deceased hostage held in Gaza.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had taken the coffin from Gaza back to Israel, where forensic tests would be used to identify the remains.If they are confirmed as belonging to a hostage, Hamas will have returned 16 of the 28 dead Israelis and foreigners it was holding before the start of a ceasefire two weeks ago.The latest handover came after the Israeli government said it had allowed a member of Hamas into territory inside Gaza controlled by the IDF to help Red Cross and Egyptian personnel search for the remaining dead hostages.Israel accuses Hamas of violating the ceasefire agreement brokered by the US, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey because it has not returned all of the hostages' bodies.The Palestinian armed group says it is committed to the deal, but that it needs help to find remains buried under the rubble left by two years of war.\"The Red Cross, the Egyptian technical team, and a Hamas person have been permitted to enter beyond the IDF's Yellow Line position in Gaza under close IDF supervision,\" Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian told a briefing on Monday afternoon.She also said the Egyptians would bring in more equipment, including \"tractor-type vehicles\".On Sunday, she had said they were using two to three excavators and a similar number of lorries to carry out searches.All 20 living Israeli hostages were released soon after the ceasefire took effect on 10 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel had also handed over the bodies of 195 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 13 Israeli hostages previously returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Before Monday night's handover, 11 of the dead hostages still in Gaza were Israelis, one was Tanzanian, and one was Thai.\"Hamas knows where they are located and there is no other option but for them to be released back home,\" Ms Bedrosian said.Earlier, the group representing the Israeli hostages' families demanded that immediate action be taken to ensure Hamas handed over all the bodies. This includes delaying the second phase of US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan.\"The families urge the government of Israel, the United States administration, and the mediators not to advance to the next phase of the agreement until Hamas fulfils all of its obligations,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said.It came after Israeli media cited an Israeli security official as saying that the Trump administration wanted to move to the second phase even if not all the hostages were found.On Saturday, Hamas's chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya said in a statement that the group was facing \"challenges\" because Israeli forces had \"altered the terrain of Gaza\".\"Moreover, some of those who buried the bodies have been martyred or no longer remember where they buried them,\" he added.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,500 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "13 hours agoWedaeli Chibelushi and Thomas NaadiIvory Coast's President Alassane Ouattara has secured a fourth term following an election in which two of his biggest challengers were barred from running, provisional results show.Ouattara, 83, won 89.8% of the vote, the electoral commission said on Monday, and businessman Jeal-Louis Billon came a distant second with only 3.09%.The landslide victory is not a huge surprise, as after being banned from the presidential race, former President Laurent Gbagbo and Credit Suisse ex-CEO Tidjane Thiam had urged their supporters to boycott the vote.Voter turnout reached just 50.1%, according to the electoral commission.Gbagbo's ex-wife Simone Gbagbo, who was allowed to contest the election, got 2.42% of the vote.Monday's results are provisional and the final outcome will be announced by the Constitutional Council after it rules on any election petitions.On Sunday, the opposition group made up of Gbagbo and Thiam's parties denounced the election as a \"civilian coup d'etat,\" saying they would not recognise Ouattara as a validly elected leader.Ouattara first assumed the presidency in 2011, following Laurent Gbagbo's arrest after his refusal to accept defeat in the 2010 election.Ouattara was originally restricted to serving two terms, but a 2016 constitutional overhaul allowed him to seek re-election in 2020, in a vote that was boycotted by the opposition.",

    "body": "Ten people accused of sexist cyber-bullying of the French president's wife, Brigitte Macron, are due to go on trial this week in Paris.The defendants are accused of spreading unsubstantiated claims over her gender and sexuality, as well as making \"malicious remarks\" about the 24-year age gap between Brigitte and her husband, Emmanuel Macron.If found guilty, the defendants face up to two years' imprisonment.Among the ten people due to appear in the dock on Monday and Tuesday are an elected official, a gallery owner and a teacher, according to French media.Two of them - self-styled independent journalist Natacha Rey and internet fortune-teller Amandine Roy – were found guilty of slander last year for claiming that France's first lady had never existed, and that her brother Jean-Michel Trogneux had changed gender and started using her name.But a court of appeals later acquitted Rey and Roy on the grounds that their statements did not constitute defamation. Mrs Macron and her brother are appealing against the decision.A conspiracy theory centred around the notion that Brigitte Macron is a transgender woman has been swirling since her husband won a first term in office in 2017.The unsubstantiated claims over Mrs Macron's gender have been gaining ground in the US, mostly promoted by right-wing influencer Candace Owens.Last July the Macrons filed a lawsuit against Owens, alleging that she \"disregarded all credible evidence disproving her claim in favour of platforming known conspiracy theorists and proven defamers\".Speaking to the BBC's Fame Under Fire podcast, the Macrons' lawyer in the case, Tom Clare, said that Brigitte Macron had found the claims \"incredibly upsetting\" and they were a \"distraction\" to the French president.\"It is incredibly upsetting to think that you have to go and subject yourself, to put this type of proof forward,\" he said.Emmanuel Macron has said pursuing legal action against Owens was about \"defending his honour\" and that the influencer had peddled false information \"with the aim of causing harm, in the service of an ideology and with established connections to far-right leaders.\"Mrs Macron first met her now-husband when she was a teacher at his secondary school. The couple ended up marrying in 2007, when Mr Macron was 29 and Mrs Macron was 54.",

    "body": "15 hours agoMichael Shuval,BBC Arabic, Jerusalem and Jaroslav LukivThe father of a released Israeli hostage who was forced to dig his own grave in a Gazan tunnel by Hamas has told the BBC his son's health is \"improving every day\".Avishai David was speaking after his 24-year-old son Evyatar David and two other freed hostages - Guy Gilboa Dalal and Eitan Mor - were discharged from hospital to a hero's welcome at their homes on Sunday.\"I can't explain how happy it makes me feel to see him growing back to his old self,\" the father added.In August, two months before Evyatar's release, Hamas had posted a video showing him emaciated in a narrow concrete tunnel - a move that drew condemnation from Israel and many Western leaders.Avishai David told the BBC he was happy to see his son's \"vitality improving every day, his colour returning [to his face], his cheeks getting fuller\".\"Thank God, he pulled through it and he's strong.\"The father said he had suffered for months knowing that his son was only \"80km away... and I can't help him\".\"It devastated me,\" he said, adding that he \"couldn't sleep, eat, drink properly.\"In August, Evyatar's brother Ilay told the BBC the Hamas video was a \"new form of cruelty\".\"He's a human skeleton. He was being starved to the point where he can be dead at any moment, and he suffers a great deal,\" Ilay said at the time.In the footage itself, Evyatar said: \"I haven't eaten for days... I barely got drinking water.\" He was seen digging what he said would be his own grave.On Sunday, cheering crowds - including many friends and neighbours - greeted Evyatar David as he returned to his hometown of Kfar Saba in central Israel. Dr Michal Shteinman, director at Rabin Medical Centre where the three released hostages were treated, told the BBC their bodies still bore the marks of \"this horrific captivity\".\"We can see their blood tests... and we've also heard their stories... they are not lying. You can see the marks of this metabolic trauma. Their skin tells their story. You can see the scars and the wounds.\"But Dr Shteinman added that the hostages \"came back stronger than they were\".Evyatar was abducted from the Nova music festival during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023.He and 19 other living hostages have been released by Hamas under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal earlier this month.Hamas has also transferred 15 out of 28 deceased hostages. Thirteen were Israelis, one was Nepalese and the other Thai.In exchange, Israel has freed 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza, and returned 15 bodies of Palestinians for every Israeli hostage's remains.The IDF launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.More than 68,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.",

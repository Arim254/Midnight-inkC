    "body": "Video has emerged appearing to show the alleged thieves behind the Louvre heist making their escape on a mechanical ladder in broad daylight.Two people can be seen looking around frantically as they slowly descend, minutes after the famed Paris museum was broken into and €88m-worth  (£77m)  of France's crown jewels were stolen.    The gang of four thieves have not been caught and on Wednesday, the Louvre's boss admitted that staff had failed to spot them early enough because there was only one camera pointing on the gallery where the items were displayed.In the video, the truck fitted with the ladder is seen parked by on a busy road running along the Seine as vehicles pass. Laurence des Cars told French lawmakers that the Louvre planned to double the number of CCTV cameras in and around the museum. She admitted that the camera trained on the Gallery of Apollo, the south-side room where the jewels were kept, was facing the wrong way.Paris city prosecutor Laure Beccuau told the Ouest France newspaper that up to 150 DNA samples and fingerprints had been retrieved so far as part of the police investigation.The theft happened in less than eight minutes, after the thieves arrived at 09:30 on Sunday (07:30 GMT) after the Louvre opened its doors to the public.They stole eight items including an emerald necklace and earrings given as a wedding gift by Napoleon Bonaparte to his second wife, Marie-LouiseAs they fled, they dropped a 19th-Century diamond-studded crown belonging to Empress Eugenie. Although it was recovered, the crown was damaged and des Cars said it had probably been crushed as the thieves prised it from its display case.",

    "body": "2 hours agoSeher AsafGetty ImagesThe Bangalore-bound bus was carrying about 40 passengers when it collided with a motorcycle on Friday A bus fire that killed at least 20 people in southern India was intensified by hundreds of smartphones being onboard, local reports say, citing forensics officials.Flames rapidly engulfed the Bangalore-bound bus after it collided with a motorcycle that ruptured its fuel tank and triggered an explosion early on Friday.Eyewitnesses said the approximately 40 passengers had struggled to escape as locals rushed to pull out survivors.Forensic experts have now told local media that the bus had been carrying a shipment of 234 mobile phones, and that the lithium-ion batteries they contained likely exacerbated the fire once they ruptured.\"The bus batteries, presence of flammable furnishings in the bus and the cargo consisting of cell phones aggravated the fire leading to the tragic event,\" CNN News18 quotes Kurnool Superintendent of Police Vikrant Patel as saying. Meanwhile, P Venkataraman, the director-general of the Andhra Pradesh Fire Services Department, said electrical batteries used for the air conditioning system of the bus also exploded and made the fire worse. \"We saw bones and ash dropping through the melted sheets,\" he told local media.The smartphones were worth 4.6m Indian rupees (£39,361; $52,377) and were being sent from Hyderabad to an e-commerce company in Bengaluru, broadcaster NDTV reports.Most smartphones have lithium-ion batteries, which can pose a fire risk when damaged.This is because they can experience thermal runaway - uncontrollable temperature increases - which is hard to stop with conventional firefighting means. It can also spread to other batteries in close proximity.Authorities have opened an investigation into possible negligent driving over the crash. The bus driver fled the scene. The motorcyclist is said to be among the dead.Buses are a common mode of transport in India, but operators frequently ignore safety rules and overcrowd vehicles, while the nation had the highest road accident death tolls in the world last year.",

    "body": "A woman who raped and murdered 12 year-old Lola Daviet in Paris has been handed a rare whole-life sentence in a case that has shocked France. Dahbia Benkired, aged 27, must spend at least 30 years in prison after a panel of judges and a jury decided to impose the country's harshest possible penalty.A whole-life term is extremely rare in France and Benkired is the first woman to receive it.Those who have been given the sentence include serial killer and rapist Michel Fourniret and jihadist Salah Abdeslam, who took part in the 2015 Paris attacks which killed 130 people.Following the verdict, Lola's mother Delphine Daviet said: \"We believed in justice and we got it.\" Her brother Thibault, added: \"We have restored the memory of my sister, we have restored the truth.\"Warning: This story contains distressing detailsLola was murdered in October 2022. Her body was discovered in a plastic storage box in the courtyard of the building where she lived in north-eastern Paris. Benkired is an Algerian immigrant who was under orders to leave the country. French right-wing and far-right politicians have seized on the case.The prosecutor in the trial had argued for Benkired to receive the longest sentence possible. Benkired was examined by psychiatric experts and found to have \"psychopathic\" traits but otherwise sane.The prosecutor told a panel of three judges and six jurors: \"Make no mistake no drug treatment can fundamentally transform Ms Benkired's personality. When there is no illness, there is no treatment.\"Before jurors began their deliberations on Friday, Benkired told the court: \"I ask for forgiveness and what I did is horrible.\"That's all I have to say.\"CCTV footage from the afternoon of 14 October, 2022 showed Benkired, then 24 years-old, approaching Lola after she returned home from school.According to reports, Benkired lured Lola into an apartment her older sister was sub-letting in the building.   Over an hour-and-a-half, Benkired subjected the 12-year-old to a sexual assault before attacking her with scissors and a box cutter.Benkired bound Lola with duct tape, including around her head, leading to her death by asphyxiation.As he read out the verdict, the presiding judge referred to the \"extreme cruelty of the criminal acts\" which he described as \"true torture\".\"In determining the appropriate sentence, the court took into account the unspeakable psychological damage to the victim and her family in such violent and almost unspeakable circumstances,\" he said.Benkired was in France on a student visa but had failed to renew it. In July 2022, she was stopped at an airport in Paris and was given 30 days to leave the country. Days after Lola's murder in October that year, Jordan Bardella, president of France's far-right National Rally party wrote on X that the woman \"had no business being in France\". Hard-right rival Éric Zemmour also took to social media to write: \"Lola's murderer should never have crossed her path.\"France's Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin criticised the \"indecency\" of politicians who, he said, \"should reflect on the consequences of their words\". Lola's mother and her father, Johan Daviet, denounced \"any use of the name and image of [our] child for political ends\".Mr Daviet died in 2024, aged 49.",

    "body": "1 day agoRayhan DemytrieCaucasus correspondentGeorgia's former Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili has appeared in court charged with large-scale money laundering - a shocking turnaround for one of the most loyal allies of billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, widely seen as Georgia's de facto leader.Prosecutors said when his home was raided by investigators earlier this month they discovered $6.5m (£4.9m) in cash.Garibashvili, 43, twice served as prime minister during the Ivanishvili years – first from 2013-15 and then again from 2021 until January last year.Now he has pleaded guilty to corruption charges that could carry a 12-year jail term and he has been granted bail of one million Georgian lari ($368,000; £277,000).The charges against the former prime minister are the latest in a string of detentions of ex-government officials.But the case against Garibashvili is the first prosecution of a senior member of Georgia's governing elite, and it comes amid the ruling party's authoritarian pivot away from the West.While serving first as defence minister and then as prime minister between 2019 and 2024, he is alleged to have \"secretly and covertly engaged in various types of business activities and received a particularly large amount of income of illegal origin\".He is accused of laundering this income and falsely declaring money as gifts from family members.His lawyer, Amiran Giguashvili, confirmed his client was working with authorities.\"The court took into account that Mr Irakli agrees to the charges, does not hide from the investigation and co-operates,\" he told the BBC.The corruption case marks a dramatic fall for a politician who worked in Ivanishvili's companies before entering politics in 2011 as part of the billionaire's Georgian Dream party, which has been in power since 2012.In February 2014, he signed Georgia's Association Agreement with the European Union.However, in recent years he has led Georgia's shift away from the EU. He developed close ties with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and said Nato's enlargement was one of the main reasons for the war in Ukraine.According to Georgian political analyst Ghia Nodia, the former prime minister's downfall reflects Bidzina Ivanishvili's mistrust of his former political appointees.\"Ivanishvili is really the driver, he decided for some reason that there is some kind of treason in his team,\" Nodia said.\"At this point, he trusts [current PM Irakli] Kobakhidze but stopped trusting his closest lieutenant, not just Garibashvili, but also [ex-security chief] Liluashvili and others.\"Meanwhile, Georgia's political turmoil continues, a year after Georgian Dream won contested parliamentary elections which the then president refused to recognise.There have been daily protests since the government's announcement in November 2024 that it would halt membership talks with the EU, and most opposition leaders are now in jail.New legislations have targeted civil society, pro-opposition media, and journalists and activists have been imprisoned.\"Ivanishvili seems like [he's] under siege,\" says Ghia Nodia. \"He believes these crazy deep state conspiracies that the West wants to destroy him through these continuous protests in Georgia.\"",

    "body": "Former Madagascan President Andry Rajoelina, who was ousted in a coup last week, has been stripped of his citizenship by the new regime.The order, signed by new Prime Minister Herintsalama Rajaonarivelo, cited local laws stipulating that people who acquired foreign citizenship should lose their Malagasy nationality.Rajoelina, 51, obtained French citizenship a decade ago, prompting calls for his disqualification from the 2023 presidential election. But he defied those calls and went on to win.He fled the African island nation after weeks of protests over persistent power and water shortages, culminating in a military takeover led by Col Michael Randrianirina.Rajoelina has said he has gone into hiding for his own safety, and his whereabouts remain unclear.When he disclosed his French nationality months before Madagascar's last presidential election, he argued he had only secretly acquired it to make things easier for his children studying in France.In recent weeks, he had faced demonstrations initially organised by youth movement Gen Z Mada and inspired by similar anti-government protests in Nepal, which were only exacerbated when his government responded with violence.Rajoelina sacked his energy minister and then his government - but this did little to quell the calls for him to step down.Protesters had hoped that Rajoelina would resign to pave the way for a smooth, democratic transition.Instead, he clung to power, eventually leading to Madagascar's elite military unit, of which Randrianirina was chief, to seize power.He has now been sworn in and has formed a new government, pledging to hold elections within two years.",

    "body": "The US has placed sanctions on Colombia's President, Gustavo Petro, accusing him of failing to curb drug trafficking and allowing cartels to \"flourish\".The decision is the latest in a growing diplomatic dispute between the Latin American nation's first left-wing leader and his US counterpart Donald Trump.The two have clashed over US strikes on boats it says are being used to smuggle drugs, killing dozens including some Colombian nationals. Trump has said other nations had failed to stop the boats, while Petro has accused him of \"murder\".Colombia was once a close ally of Washington's war on drugs, receiving hundreds of millions of dollars annually in military assistance to counter drug gangs.The US also trains Colombian narcotics agents - something the Trump administration has said it will continue to support.But in its sanctions decision, it singled out Petro as having presided over a \"disastrous and ineffective\" drug policy that had led to a large increase in cocaine production.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that since Petro came to power, cocaine production in Colombia had \"exploded to the highest rate in decades, flooding the United States and poisoning Americans\".Sanctions have also been imposed on Colombia's Interior Minister Armando Benedetti, as well as Petro's wife and eldest son. All are barred from accessing assets and any properties they may have in the US. Petro responded that he had been fighting drug trafficking \"for decades\" and that his administration had stemmed the growth of coca crops.\"What the US Treasury is doing is an arbitrariness typical of an oppressive regime,\" he said.Cocaine production is currently at record-high levels in Colombia, according to researcher Héctor Galeano from the Colombia-based Institute of Advanced Social and Cultural Studies of Latin America and the Caribbean.The US Treasury said that cocaine from Colombia was often purchased by Mexican cartels, which then smuggle it into the US.  The US says it is removing Colombia's certification as an ally in the war on drugs, which grants it access to financial support. Colombia responded that it would cease buying weapons from the US.Petro has insisted that it was during the government of his predecessor, Iván Duque, that the area planted with coca had increased.He has also said that, in order for coca cultivation to decrease, what was needed was for demand for cocaine to go down in the US and in Europe.His primary attempts to curb drug-related criminality in Colombia have centred on facilitating peace negotiations between warring cartels that have for decades brought violence to the nation.His campaign promise of bringing \"total peace\" to Colombia appears to be collapsing, with mounting attacks and stalled negotiations.Petro told BBC News in September air strikes on alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean were an \"act of tyranny\".He used a speech at the UN in New York around the same time to argue the attacks were not about controlling the drug trade but serving a need to use \"violence to dominate Colombia and Latin America\".Imposing sanctions on a head of state is rare but not unprecedented. The leaders of countries including Russia, North Korea and Venezuela have previously been sanctioned.",

    "body": "Trump hopes China will help push Russia towards Ukraine peace talks3 hours agoTiffany WertheimerReutersTrump and Xi last met in person in 2019, during Trump's first term as presidentDonald Trump has said he would like China's help to deal with Russia as he seeks to bring an end to the war in Ukraine.\"I'd like China to help us out with Russia,\" the US president said on board Air Force One, as he flew to Asia for a whirlwind tour, where he will meet China's Xi Jinping in South Korea.It could be wishful thinking, however. China is Russia's biggest ally, and a vital support to Moscow since Western sanctions were imposed over its war in Ukraine.Trump's comments come off the back of a difficult week for Kyiv - the US refused to give it Tomahawk cruise missiles, EU leaders did not release frozen Russian cash to help fund its defence, and there have been more deadly strikes.Ending the Russia-Ukraine war has become a focal point for Trump in recent months, with a ceasefire deal so far eluding him, despite his campaign promises to solve the situation quickly. A summit with Putin in August failed to yield any tangible results, and Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Moscow.\"Every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere,\" Trump said earlier this week.On Wednesday, he announced new sanctions against Russia's two biggest oil companies - the first direct interventions the Trump administration has imposed on Russia over the war. What effect the blacklisting will have in the long-term is yet to be seen, but the Kremlin said it was \"immune\" to the sanctions.What's the significance of US sanctions on Russian oil?While Trump's meeting with Xi on Thursday is still expected to focus on the hostile trade relations between the US and China, Trump said that he would talk to Xi about \"everything\", including the war in Ukraine.\"I'd like to see China help us out [with Russia]. I have a very good relationship... with President Xi. Very good,\" he said, adding that Xi wants to see the war end.Earlier this week, Trump said that the Chinese president \"can have a big influence on Putin\".SPUTNIK/KREMLIN POOL/EPA/ShutterstockPutin, Xi and Kim showed their solidarity when the three met in Beijing last monthBeijing has never criticised Russia's war in Ukraine, and has been accused by the US and its allies of aiding Russia's war effort - which Beijing denies - through its purchases of Russian oil and monthly supply of dual-use materials (those with both commercial and military applications).Putin and Xi have previously touted their countries' relationship as a \"friendship with no limits\", and Russia hopes gas exports to China and other countries will replace the revenue lost after Western sanctions were imposed.Xi, Putin and Kim show united front at huge Chinese military paradeRussia's Putin hails 'unprecedented' ties with China at talks in BeijingThe warm relations between Russia and China were on full display last month, when Putin, Xi and North Korea's Kim Jong Un met in Beijing for an extraordinary show of solidarity and military might.EPA/ShutterstockRussian strikes on Kyiv left killed several people and caused huge damage on SaturdayAs Trump made his comments on Air Force One, emergency crews in Ukraine were at the scene of more Russian strikes, including some in Kyiv where several people were killed, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said.\"No country should be left alone in the face of such evil,\" he wrote on Telegram, reiterating the need for Ukraine's allies to step-up support.Meanwhile, in Russia's Belgorod region, residents living near a dam were told to evacuate after a Ukrainian strike on the local reservoir caused damage that could lead to flooding.More on this story",

    "body": "23 hours agoMallory MoenchStandWithUsMichael Smuss in an updated handout photoMichael Smuss, a survivor of the Warsaw Ghetto in Poland who resisted the Nazis, has died aged 99 in Israel. He joined the ghetto uprising as a teenager in 1943, helping to make petrol bombs. Taken prisoner, he survived concentration camps and a death march before the end of World War II. After the war, he became an artist and Holocaust educator. The embassies of Germany and Poland in Israel paid tribute to him on social media. \"He repeatedly risked his life during the Holocaust, fighting for survival and helping other prisoners in the Warsaw Ghetto – even after he was captured by the Nazis and deported to concentration camps,\" the German embassy stated on X.The Polish embassy said Smuss \"lectured youth on the history of Polish Jews and expressed his memories through art. His legacy endures.\"The Polish embassy and the Holocaust Educational Trust, a UK charity, called Smuss the last surviving fighter of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. However, in 2018, Israeli officials and international media, including the BBC, reported that Simcha Rotem, who had just died aged 94, was the last surviving fighter of the uprising.Last month, Germany's ambassador to Israel awarded Smuss with the German Federal Cross of Merit, in recognition of his contribution to Holocaust education and promoting dialogue between the two countries, the embassy said.\"Thousands of people, especially young people in Germany, have learned from his testimonies.\"German Embassy in IsraelThe German ambassador to Israel awarded a medal to Michael Smuss in SeptemberSmuss was born in 1926 in the Free City of Danzig, a city-state that is now Gdansk, Poland. He later moved to Lodz before being deported to the Warsaw Ghetto with his father.Hundreds of thousands of Jews were crammed into the ghetto, where they faced poverty, starvation, disease and cold.Since Smuss spoke German, he was taken outside to work in a factory repairing and repainting helmets, he recounted in a video recorded for the Sumter Museum in the US in 2022.He joined the Jewish Resistance in the ghetto, and he and others started stealing as much paint thinner as possible to make petrol bombs.\"We filled up bottles which were put up on the roofs of all the houses close to the entrance of the ghetto with the expectation that once they're going to come, we'd be throwing them down\", he said.On 19 April the Nazis came to empty the ghetto, an enclave in Warsaw created by the Nazis to segregate and persecute Jews. The resistance fought back with weapons they had exchanged for warm clothes from Italian soldiers who had been sent from Africa to the Russian front.The resistance, which Smuss called \"the greatest uprising in this war against Germany\", lasted 28 days.\"It was very rough... no shower, no food. They were burning up, liquidating one house after another, full of smoke burning in your eyes,\" he said.He described thousands of bodies lying in front of houses and \"the smell of gas and decomposed bodies\".He, among some others, was taken prisoner on 29 April.Corbis via Getty ImagesMichael Smuss, identified by The Jerusalem Post as fourth from left, taken prisoner after the Warsaw Ghetto UprisingThey were put on a train to the Treblinka extermination camp. As he witnessed people dying on the journey, \"my heart became a stone\", he said.Along the way, the train was stopped by employers looking to retrieve workers that had been taken from their factories. Another German came looking for experienced workers, and Smuss offered himself and those he knew.\"When we left on the train to Treblinka, I was sure that my life was over,\" he told The Jerusalem Post earlier this year. \"But when the train came to a halt, I felt with all of my being that on this day I was not going to die.\"He was moved and endured forced labour at other camps, and finally a death march to Dachau, before his Nazi captors fled incoming American troops.He told The Jerusalem Post that his father was killed trying to escape one camp, while his mother and sister, who had been able to stay in Lodz, survived.Smuss initially returned to Poland, but then moved to the US, where he worked, studied and started a family. After experiencing trauma symptoms, he moved to Israel in 1979 alone to seek help, where he took up art and educating others about the Holocaust. He is survived by his wife.",

    "body": "Donald Trump has said he would like to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his upcoming trip to Asia.\"I would. If you want to put out the word, I'm open to it,\" the US president told reporters onboard Air Force One as he departed for the region, adding that he \"had a great relationship\" with Kim. Trump made history during his first term, becoming the first sitting US president to set foot into North Korea when they last shook hands in 2019.His trip to Malaysia and Japan will see him meet a number of world leaders including China's Xi Jinping, amid trade negotiations sparked by Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs earlier this year.Trump has taken an atypical approach to North Korea - a secretive communist totalitarian state largely isolated on the world stage - and its attempts at creating nuclear weapons, initially taunting Kim as a \"little rocket man\".The pair met face-to-face three times during Trump's previous tenure in the White House but failed to agree a denuclearisation programme. North Korea has since conducted multiple tests of intercontinental missiles, its neighbours say.Asked if he would recognise North Korea as a nuclear state, Trump told reporters late on Thursday: \"I think they are sort of a nuclear power... They got a lot of nuclear weapons, I'll say that.\"Kim has said he was open to meeting Trump again, provided the US stopped pursuing its \"absurd\" demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. \"I still have a good memory of President Trump,\" Kim said in a speech last month, according to state media.Friends reunited? Trump faces a very different Kim Jong Un this timeSouth Korea's Unification Minister Chung Dong-young, who handles relations between the North and South, said there was a \"considerable\" chance the two leaders might meet while Trump is in South Korea for the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum, according to news agency AFP.A senior US official told reporters that a meeting was not in Trump's schedule, according to the Anadolu Agency - though their last meeting in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas came off the back of an invitation by Trump on social media.Trump's first stop will be in Malaysia, where he will attend Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit.He is expected to land in the South Korean city Busan on Wednesday ahead of the Apec summit. He will meet South Korean leader Lee Jae Myung, who discussed peace on the Korean peninsula and the possibility of a Trump-Kim meeting while visiting the White House in August.Lee told the BBC he was open to a deal between Trump and Kim in which North Korea agreed to freeze production of its nuclear weapons.Trump's meeting with China's President Xi comes on the backdrop of a trade war between the two nations.The two have agreed to hold off triple-digit tariffs threatened against one another while seeking a trade agreement - but that detente is in jeopardy after Trump said he would level a 100% trade levy on Chinese goods over Beijing's curbs on rare earth exports.The minerals are essential for many electronics and China is currently responsible for around 90% of exports of their refined form.",

    "body": "1 day agoDearbail JordanReutersForged art claiming to show works by famous artists, including Picasso and Rembrandt, has been seized by policeBavarian police have seized millions of euros worth of forged art claiming to show works by Picasso, Rembrandt and Kahlo in an operation spanning Germany, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Authorities in Bavaria said the main suspect is a 77-year-old German man who, along with 10 alleged accomplices, is facing charges of conspiracy and fraud.Investigators first became suspicious when the septuagenarian ringleader attempted to sell two supposedly original paintings by Picasso on the art market.He then wanted to sell De Staalmeesters, a famous oil painting by Dutch old master Rembrandt, for 120 million Swiss francs (£113m) - despite the original hanging in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.The Bavarian State Criminal Police Office (BLKA) said the forged De Staalmeesters - which is sometimes referred to as the Masters of the Clothmakers' Guild - was owned by an 84-year-old Swiss woman.She is now being investigated by the Amberg public prosecutor's office, the BLKA and Swiss authorities after the forged piece was confiscated in Switzerland.At the time, after being examined by an art expert, the police said: \"It was, as suspected, a copy and not a lost masterpiece by Rembrandt van Rijn.\"  The painting was seized during a co-ordinated series of dawn raids across Germany, Switzerland and Liechtenstein on Wednesday 15 October.During the searches, a large number of suspected art forgeries were found and seized, the BLKA said, along with \"documents, records, mobile phones, storage media and cloud data\". Rembrandt to Picasso: Five ways to spot a fake masterpieceHow do you know if a Banksy painting is real?Bavarian police said the main suspect attempted to sell a further 19 counterfeit works, purportedly by world-famous artists for between €400,000 (£349,000) and €14m (£12.2m). They included copies of work by Mexican painter Frida Kahlo as well as Flemish old master Peter Paul Rubens, Italian sculptor Amedeo Modigliani and Spain's Joan Miró.He was assisted by 74-year-old German man who \"prepared expert reports specifically to confirm the authenticity of the artworks\".The BLKA said that he and the main suspect were arrested on the day of the raids before being conditionally released.The police said that the investigation is in progress.\"Among other things, all confiscated paintings will be examined in detail by experts and appraisers in the coming weeks,\" police said.",

    "body": "Venezuela's Maduro says US 'fabricating war' as it deploys world's largest warship3 hours agoKayla Epstein and Josh Cheetham,BBC VerifyThe USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, can carry up to 90 aircraftVenezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has accused the US of \"fabricating a new war\", after it ordered the world's largest warship to be sent to the Caribbean.The USS Gerald R Ford can carry up to 90 aircraft and its deployment marks a massive increase in US firepower in the region.The US has conducted 10 air strikes on vessels in the area as part of what it says is a war on drug traffickers. US President Donald Trump has accused Maduro of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organisation, which he denies, and there are fears in Venezuela that the US military build-up is aimed at removing the long-time opponent of Trump from power. The US is among many nations that do not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader, after the last election in 2024 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair. Opposition tallies from polling stations showed its candidate had won by a landslide.Venezuela plays a relatively minor role in the region's drug trade.What's Trump's endgame in Venezuela?The Pentagon said on Friday that the USS Gerald R Ford carrier would deploy to the US Southern Command area of responsibility, which includes Central America and South America, as well as the Caribbean. The additional forces \"will enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle transnational criminal organisations\", spokesman Sean Parnell said.Maduro accused the US of seeking \"a new eternal war\" in his address.\"They promised they would never again get involved in a war, and they are fabricating a war,\" he told state media.The carrier's deployment would provide the resources to start conducting strikes against targets on the ground. Trump has repeatedly raised the possibility of what he called \"land action\" in Venezuela, saying earlier this week that the US is \"looking at land now\" after getting \"the sea very well under control\".\"We stopped all drugs from coming in by sea. I will stop all drugs from coming in by land very shortly. You'll see that starting,\" he told reporters at the White House on Saturday before departing for a trip to Asia.The US has also bolstered its air presence in the region. BBC Verify has identified a number of US military aircraft across Puerto Rico.It comes as CNN reports Trump is considering targeting cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela, but is yet to make a final decision.Military analysts have pointed out that intercepting drugs at sea does not require a force as big as the current US one.Watch: The US is \"fabricating an eternal war\", says Nicolás MaduroOn Friday, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said \"six male narco-terrorists\" had been killed in an operation in the Caribbean.He said the boat had belonged to the Tren de Aragua - a transnational criminal organisation which has its base in Venezuela and has been proscribed as a terrorist group by the US State Department.The US air strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. \"This is about regime change. They're probably not going to invade, the hope is this is about signalling,\" Dr Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House think tank, told the BBC.He argued the military build-up was intended to \"strike fear\" into the hearts of the Venezuelan military and Maduro's inner circle so that they move against him.Pete Hegseth on XThe US said it had destroyed a drug trafficking boat earlier on FridayThe strike was the latest the Trump administration has carried out against alleged drug traffickers since early September. Most have taken place off the coast of South America, in the Caribbean, but on 21 and 22 October it carried out strikes in the Pacific Ocean as well.At least 43 people have been killed.Members of US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have raised concerns about the legality of the strikes and the president's authority to order them.On 10 September, 25 Democratic senators wrote to the White House, alleging the administration had struck a vessel days earlier \"without evidence that the individuals on the vessel and the vessel's cargo posed a threat to the United States\".Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican, has argued that such strikes require congressional approval. Trump has said he has the legal authority to order the strikes.\"We're allowed to do that, and if we do [it] by land, we may go back to Congress,\" Trump told White House reporters on Wednesday.Brian Finucane, a former US State Department lawyer, told the BBC that the situation amounted to a constitutional crisis that the US Congress, controlled by Republicans, has appeared unwilling to challenge. \"It is the US Congress that has principal control over the use of military force. That control has been usurped in this instance by the White House, and so it's up to Congress to push back,\" said Mr Finucane, who now works at the International Crisis Group.  ",

    "body": "21 hours agoJaroslav Lukiv and Vitaliy Shevchenko,Russia editor at Downing StreetEPA/ShutterstockMore than 20 nations supporting Ukraine have pledged to \"take Russian oil and gas off the global market\" as part of efforts to pressure President Vladimir Putin to end the war.\"We're choking off funding for Russia's war machine,\" said UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, after hosting a summit of the so-called \"coalition of the willing\" in London.The UK and US have in recent days sanctioned Russia's two biggest oil companies, while the EU targeted Moscow's liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was also in London, said \"pressure\" on Russia was the only way to stop the fighting. However, no long-range missile deliveries were announced at the summit.Zelensky has long argued that US-made Tomahawks and European missiles would help make the war costs heavier for Moscow by hitting key military targets – including oil refineries and weapons depots – deep inside Russia.But during last week's talks in Washington, US President Donald Trump indicated to Zelensky that he was not ready to supply Tomahawks.On Thursday, Putin warned that if \"such weapons are used to strike Russian Federation territory the response will be... overwhelming\".Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022 and currently controls around a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula that it annexed in 2014.Speaking at a joint press conference after the London summit, Sir Keir said Putin was \"not serious about peace\", and therefore Ukraine's allies agreed a \"clear plan for the rest of the year\" on supporting Ukraine.The UK prime minister said this also included targeting Russia's sovereign assets to \"unlock billions to help finance Ukraine's defence\". He gave no further details.On Thursday, EU leaders agreed to help support Ukraine's \"financial needs\" for the next two years - but stopped short of agreeing to use frozen Russian assets worth €140bn (£122bn).Asked about a so-called \"reparations loan\" for Ukraine funded by the Russian assets, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she hoped a decision would be made by Christmas Eve.In London, the \"coalition of the willing\" also pledged to strengthen Ukraine's air defences\" amid almost daily Russian air assaults on Ukrainian civilians and energy infrastructure.Zelensky warned that Russia \"wants to make the winter cold a tool of torment\", adding: \"They want to break us.\"Comments by the leaders in London will be disappointing for those who were hoping to hear specific examples of how Kyiv's allies were planning to prevent Russia from attacking Ukraine.No doubt, a lot of the words said will be pleasing to the Ukrainian ear. For example, Sir Keir said the UK and Ukraine's other allies were prepared to ratchet up pressure on Moscow.But there were no concrete examples of how exactly the allies were planning to force a change on the battlefield or force Putin to the negotiating table.EPA/ShutterstockUkrainian officials say a kindergarten was hit in a Russian air strike on the north-eastern city of Kharkiv earlier this weekIn Ukraine, several people who spoke to the BBC said they were more focused on everyday problems, rather than following Zelensky's trip to the UK.Yana Kolomiets, from Odesa, said there was a lack of electricity, heating and water in the southern city.\"The more scary thing is that the Russians started launching guided bombs on our region,\" she added.Tetiana Dankevych, from the capital Kyiv, said power outages and a problems with water supplies caused by Russian strikes were making life \"very difficult\".\"I don't have a feeling this war will end soon,\" she said.Further support for Ukraine's energy infrastructure was among the issues discussed at the London summit - however, no specific announcements were made.Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte also took part in the London meeting, while other leaders - including French President Emmanuel Macron - participated via a video link.Ukraine and its Western allies have publicly agreed with Trump's proposal that the fighting should be immediately frozen along the vast front line for negotiations to begin.Russia has rejected this idea, repeating demands that Kyiv and its allies describe as de facto capitulation by Ukraine.Earlier on Friday, Zelensky held talks with King Charles at Windsor – their third meeting this year.",

    "body": "Ontario to stop running anti-tariff advert that angered Trump18 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporter, in TorontoGetty ImagesDoug Ford said the advert will still run over the weekend, but will be paused on Monday so that trade talks between Canada and the US can resumeOntario Premier Doug Ford has said he will pause his province's anti-tariff advertisement campaign in the US, after it prompted President Donald Trump to terminate trade talks.Ford - one of Canada's most vocal critics of US levies on Canadian goods - said he made the decision after speaking to Prime Minister Mark Carney on Friday, adding that the TV spot will be paused on Monday \"so that trade talks can resume\". It will still run over the weekend on US networks, he said, including during the Major League Baseball World Series games.Carney told reporters earlier on Friday that Canada was prepared to resume trade talks with the US \"when the Americans are ready\".Trump criticised the advert late on Thursday night in a Truth Social post, calling it \"FAKE\" and \"egregious\". He said trade talks were \"HEREBY TERMINATED\".The advert, which was sponsored by the Ontario government, quotes former US President Ronald Reagan, a Republican and icon of US conservatism, saying tariffs \"hurt every American\".The video takes excerpts from a 1987 national radio address that focused on foreign trade.Trump's termination of trade talks came after the Ronald Reagan Foundation, which is charged with preserving Reagan's legacy, released a statement saying the advert had used \"selective\" audio and video of the former president's remarks.It accused the advert of misrepresenting Reagan's address, and said the Ontario government had not sought permission to use it.What's in advert that caused trade talks to collapse?Carney says Canada will restart trade talks when US is readyOn Friday, Ford said the intention of the advert was \"to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build\" and the impact of tariffs.\"We've achieved our goal, having reached US audiences at the highest levels,\" he said.Trump's reaction to the advert has ignited debate in Canada over whether Ford's combative approach to US trade talks was the right one, or whether the country would be better served by striking a friendlier chord with its neighbour and closest trade ally.Canada's prime minister: American trade policy 'fundamentally changed'Canada is still the only G7 country that has not reached a trade deal with the US since Trump began introducing sweeping tariffs.The US has imposed a 35% levy on all Canadian goods - though most are exempt under an existing free trade agreement. It has also slapped sector-specific levies on Canadian goods, including a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.Those sector tariffs have especially hurt Ontario, where the bulk of Canada's automobile manufacturing industry is based.Carney has attempted for months to negotiate a deal that would ease the tariffs. Three-quarters of Canadian exports are sold to the US, making its economy particularly vulnerable. In doing so, he has opted for friendly face-to-face meetings and text messages with the US president.Ford, on the other hand, has taken a more defiant stance. He pulled US liquor off Ontario shelves and briefly threatened withholding energy exports. Last week, he told reporters he was \"sick and tired of sitting and rolling over\", after car manufacturer Stellantis announced it would move some production out of its Brampton, Ontario, plant into the US.\"We need to fight back,\" Ford said at the time. The next day, he launched the advertisement campaign that eventually drew the ire of the US president.'Theatrics and hyperbole'Trump's abrupt termination of trade talks is unsurprising to most Canadians, said Mahmood Nanji, a fellow at the Ivey Business School at Western University and former associate deputy finance minister in Ontario. The US president had made a similar threat earlier this year after Ottawa announced it would impose a digital services tax on US technology firms.\"His posts tend to be full of theatrics and hyperbole,\" Mr Nanji said. And while some might appreciate Ford standing up for the Ontario industries hardest hit by tariffs, the timing and tone of Ford's advert campaign has not helped Canada's case, causing an \"unnecessary distraction\", Mr Nanji added.It is unclear if trade talks will indeed resume now that Ford has pulled the ad, and Trump is yet to respond to the announcement that it will stop running.The White House signalled frustration with what it called \"Canada's longstanding, unfair trade barriers\" on Friday, adding that efforts to address these issues \"have not led to any constructive progress\".Carney has made some appeasements to keep talks going, including removing retaliatory tariffs and dropping Canada's digital services tax. But he has repeatedly said that he is searching for \"the best deal for Canada\".Both Trump and Carney are heading to Asia on Friday for the ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur. The Canadian prime minister told reporters that the focus of his trip would be \"developing new partnerships and opportunities, including with the economic giants of Asia\".But Carney also left the door open to continue trade talks with the US. Mr Nanji said the advert saga was a reminder that the path to a deal for Canada will not be an easy one, regardless of negotiation methods.He noted remarks by Carney earlier in the week in which he stated that \"the US has fundamentally changed its approach to trade\" and that Canada's close tie to the US had become a vulnerability. \"We have to take care of ourselves because we can't rely on one foreign partner,\" Carney said in a speech on Wednesday to tease his government's first budget, which will be unveiled on 4 November.The speech, Mr Nanji said, was also meant to \"caution Canadians that this is going to be a really rocky road with the Americans\".",

    "body": "16 hours agoJames ChaterReutersQueen Sirikit, the mother of Thailand's King Vajiralongkorn, has died aged 93. She passed away \"peacefully\" in a Bangkok hospital at 21:21 local time (14:21 GMT) on Friday, according to the Thai Royal Household Bureau.Sirikit had \"suffered several illnesses\" while in hospital since 2019, including a blood infection this month, it added.For more than six decades, Queen Sirikit was married to Thailand's longest-reigning monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died in 2016. In their globe-trotting heyday, she was seen as a style icon.King Vajiralongkorn has ordered that the Thai Royal Household Bureau organise a royal funeral, the statement added.Queen Sirikit's body will lie in state at the Grand Palace's Dusit Thorne Hall in Bangkok, it said.Thai royal family members will also observe a year of mourning.ReutersGetty ImagesQueen Sirikit (centre) married the late Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej (right) in 1950As a young queen, Sirikit was regarded as a fashion iconQueen Sirikit met her future husband, King Bhumibol, while studying music in Paris, where her father was at the time stationed as Thai ambassador to France.\"It was hate at first sight,\" she said in a 1980 BBC documentary about the Thai monarchy, Soul of a Nation, adding that he had arrived late to their first meeting. \"He said he would arrive at four o'clock in the afternoon. He arrived at seven o'clock, kept me standing there, practising curtsy and curtsy,\" she said.The couple married on 28 April 1950, just a week before King Bhumibol was crowned in Bangkok.As a young couple in the 1960s, Queen Sirikit and King Bhumibol travelled around the world, meeting famous faces including US President Dwight Eisenhower, the late Queen Elizabeth II and Elvis Presley.During that decade, she frequently made international best-dressed lists.In the rare 1980 interview with the BBC, she also described the relationship between the monarchy and people in Thailand, which continues to observe strict lese-majeste laws forbidding insult of the monarchy. She said: \"Kings and queens of Thailand have always been in close contact with the people and they usually regard the king as the father of the nation.\"That is why we do not have much private life, because we are considered father and mother of the nation.\"She was seen as a key maternal figure for the country, with her birthday, 12 August, marked as Mother's Day since 1976.In 2008, she attended the funeral of an anti-government protester killed in violent clashes with police. Queen Sirikit suffered a stroke in 2012, after which she was rarely seen in public.She is survived by her son and three daughters. ",

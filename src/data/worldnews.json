    "body": "Hamas ruled Gaza with an iron rod - will it really give up control?2 days agoPaul Adams,Diplomatic correspondent, Jerusalem and Rushdi Abualouf,Gaza correspondentBBCHow does a group that has governed the Gaza Strip for almost 20 years, ruling two million Palestinians with an iron rod and fighting Israel in repeated wars, suddenly lay down its arms and relinquish control?Judging by a steady stream of gruesome images emerging from Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect on 10 October, Hamas seems intent on reasserting its authority.Its masked men, back on the streets, have been seen beating and executing opponents. Impromptu firing squads have dispatched kneeling men they say are members of rival groups, including some of Gaza's powerful clans.Other victims, cowering in terror, are shot in the legs or beaten with heavy clubs.Some of those now being attacked by Hamas had been part of groups involved in looting and diverting aid, according to one aid worker I spoke to, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. The UN has also accused criminal gangs of stealing aid.This is not yet a world in which, as US President Donald Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan envisages, Hamas fighters turn over their weapons, submit to an amnesty, leave Gaza and hand over to an international stabilisation force.AFP via Getty ImagesThe ceasefire came into effect on Friday 10 October​ - Hamas and Israel have both blamed each other for blatant violations of itFor his part, President Trump initially seemed ambivalent about the brutality.On his way to Israel on 13 October, he signalled the US had given Hamas - designated a terrorist group by the US, UK, Israel and others - a green light to restore order.\"We have given them approval for a period of time,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One.Three days later, he hardened his tone. \"If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal,\" he wrote on Truth Social, \"we will have no choice but to go in and kill them.\"So, where does this situation on the ground in Gaza today leave Hamas? And ultimately, after two years of war that has resulted in unparalleled suffering for its own people and the violent death of most of its key figures, what, if anything, does the future really hold for the group?'A complete loss of law and order'For many Gazans, traumatised and exhausted by two years of perpetual suffering - and a war that has killed 68,000 people in Gaza according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry - this ugly endgame is nerve-wracking, but doesn't come as a surprise.Of the Gazans I spoke to - among them, aid workers, lawyers, as well as a former adviser to a Hamas leader - each has a different take on the likelihood of Hamas laying down its arms and relinquishing control. And indeed - given the situation on the ground - whether now is the time for them to do so.Anadolu via Getty ImagesPalestinians gathered to celebrate following the announcement of the ceasefire agreement \"It's been two years with a complete loss of law and order,\" aid worker Hanya Aljamal says from her home in Deir al-Balah, in the middle of the Gaza Strip. \"We need someone to take over.\"As unqualified as Hamas is to rule the Strip, they are a better option than the gangs.\"Dr Ahmad Yousef, a former advisor to Ismail Haniyeh, who was Hamas's political leader, is of the opinion that a firm grip is needed at present.\"As long as there are still people who try to take the law into their hands, we need somebody to scare them and squeeze them to the corner,\" says Dr Yousef, who now runs a Gaza think tank and remains close to the Hamas leadership.'As unqualified as Hamas is to rule the Strip, they are a better option than the gangs,' argues aid worker Hanya Aljamal \"This will take time. Not a long time. Within a month we will host those police forces and soldiers from Turkey and Egypt,\" he continues, referring to the international stabilisation force for Gaza, outlined in the peace plan, that could be composed of troops from Egypt and Turkey, among others. \"This is the moment where they will set their guns aside.\"Other Gazans are more sceptical, and fearful. Some aren't convinced that Hamas will give up their power - or weapons at all.Moumen al-Natour, a Gaza-based lawyer imprisoned several times by Hamas, is one of them. AFP via Getty ImagesMany Palestinians and Israelis doubt Hamas is willing to step back from a political roleHe has been in hiding since July, when he says masked Hamas gunmen came to his Gaza City apartment and ordered him to report to al-Shifa hospital for interrogation.\"Hamas is [sending] a message to the world and to President Donald Trump… that they will neither relinquish power nor hand over their weapons.\"If I fell into Hamas' hands now, they would make a video and kill me in the street with a shot to the head,\" he says in one of a series of videos sent to us from an undisclosed location in the Gaza Strip. The wall behind him is riddled with bullet holes.Moumen al-Natour, a Gaza-based lawyer: 'If I fell into Hamas' hands now, they would make a video and kill me in the street with a shot to the head'\"It is a gang, not a government,\" he says of Hamas. \"I don't want them to remain in Gaza… I don't want them in government, and I don't want them in security. I don't want to see their ideas spread in mosques, in the streets, or in schools.\"'Still the dominant player in Gaza'Mr al-Natour has his own take on what Gaza could look like.The disparate array of militias now under Hamas assault could, in his view, be integrated into a new security apparatus. But with their competing agendas, sometimes murky pasts and, in some cases, controversial links to the Israeli military, it's a problematic proposition.\"The fact is – and sometimes it's very hard for Israelis to admit this – that Hamas still exists and is the dominant player in Gaza.\" says Dr Michael Milshtein, a former head of the department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence.\"Relying on suspicious players - clans, militias, gangs, many of them criminals, many of them affiliated with ISIS [the Islamic State group], many of them involved in terror attacks against Israel - and considering them as a kind of alternative to Hamas is an illusion.\"'Hamas still exists and is the dominant player in Gaza' says Dr Michael Milshtein, a former head of the department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military IntelligenceHamas officials have said the group is willing to hand over political control of Gaza. The Trump ceasefire plan, to which it gave its qualified support, envisages \"temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee\".But even if the group is willing to step back from a political role – something many Palestinians and Israelis still doubt - persuading its battle-hardened fighters to lay down their weapons is a big step for an organisation whose power, even before October 2023, relied heavily on the force of arms.Rise of Hamas and its iron gripTo begin to answer the complex question of what may happen to Hamas next requires delving backwards into how exactly it consolidated power in the first place.From its origins in the 1980s as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and a rival to the secular Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Hamas morphed into a violent militant group responsible for the deaths of Israeli civilians.Initially, Israel offered discreet support to Hamas, seeing it as a useful counterweight to the PLO and its dominant faction, Fatah, led at the time by Yasser Arafat.\"The major enemy was Fatah,\" says Ami Ayalon, former head of Israel's domestic security service, Shin Bet, \"because they were the people who demanded a Palestinian state.\"But when Hamas launched deadly suicide bomb attacks in the 1990s and 2000s on Israelis, Israel responded with a series of high-profile assassinations.A violent power struggle with Fatah left Hamas, which won a 2006 election, in sole control of the Gaza Strip.Eighteen years of Hamas rule have followed, characterised by an Israeli military and economic blockade, and bouts of armed conflict in 2008-09, 2012, 2014 and 2021.Despite Israeli claims since October 2023 that \"Hamas is ISIS\", the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously convinced itself that Hamas did not pose a strategic threat.\"His was a policy of managing the conflict,\" says Mr Ayalon. \"He said we are not going to solve it and we are totally against the reality of two states, so the only way is to divide and control.\"With Hamas in control in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas, ruling in part of the occupied West Bank, the Palestinians remained hopelessly divided, enabling Israel to argue that it had no unified leadership to negotiate peace with.\"[Netanyahu] did everything in order to support Hamas in Gaza,\" Mr Ayalon says. \"He let Qatar send them… more than $1.5bn.\"Getty ImagesIsrael has gone to enormous lengths to eliminate Hamas's key political and military figuresThe money from Qatar was meant to pay the wages of civil servants and support the poorest families, but security chiefs feared it was being used for other purposes.Mr Ayalon adds: \"It was clear to the director of the Shin Bet and the head of Mossad that this money would go to military infrastructure.Netanyahu has defended allowing payments to Hamas, saying it was meant to aid the civilian population.Hamas was always preparing for warAs 7 October brutally revealed, Hamas was always preparing for war. Nowhere was this more obvious than in its elaborate network of tunnels.Tunnels had already been used to mount attacks on Israeli army positions during the second Palestinian uprising, or \"Intifada\" that began in 2000.In 2006, Hamas fighters used a tunnel under the border with Israel to attack a military post near Kerem Shalom, killing two Israel soldiers and kidnapping a third, Gilad Shalit. He was held for five years until his release, in 2011, in exchange for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners, including Yahya Sinwar, who would go on to mastermind the Hamas attacks of October 2023.Getty ImagesYahya Sinwar, one of those behind the Hamas attacks of October 2023Over time, Hamas' tunnel network expanded, to include workshops, weapons-manufacturing sites and command centres.Regional developments also played a role. In 2012, after the fall of the Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the brief rise to power of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Hamas was able to smuggle increasingly sophisticated weapons into Gaza, including sniper rifles, mobile rocket launchers and equipment for the manufacture of long-range rockets.Hamas is thought to have benefitted from the help of technicians and fighters with experience of tunnelling in places like Lebanon and Iraq.Iran was also a key supporter, seeing Hamas as a natural component in its \"Axis of Resistance,\" a loose coalition of militant groups across the Middle East with a shared antipathy towards Israel and the United States.In 2020, a US State Department report said that Iran was providing around $100m a year to Palestinian militant groups including Hamas.Yousef Masoud/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesOver time, Hamas' tunnel network expandedSome tunnels were reportedly dug as deep as 230ft (70m) below ground, took years to build and cost tens of millions of dollars each. These were designed to protect senior Hamas commanders and house long-range weapons.A local expert with extensive knowledge of the tunnels told the BBC the cost of the entire project totalled roughly $6bn (£4.5bn).Precise figures are hard to come by, but it's thought that the scattered network extended for as much as 250 miles (400km), in a strip of land just 26 miles long and, at its widest, seven miles across.Tunnels: a project shrouded in secrecyPublic discussion of the tunnels - their location or cost - could expose Gazans to accusations of espionage, leading to arrest and worse. But many knew what was happening. Local residents would see the tell-tale signs: sand and clay being removed, new entrances appearing unexpectedly and machinery being brought in under cover of darkness.What began as an opportunistic response to Gaza's isolation became, over the span of three decades, a multi-layered subterranean industrial and military complex.It emerged later that much of it was concealed under Gaza's civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, schools and, in the case of a tunnel containing a Hamas data centre, the headquarters of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza City.Anadolu via Getty ImagesAt least 67,938 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since since October 2023, according to the Hamas-run health ministryAfter 7 October 2023, when Hamas fighters stormed into Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage, it also became a massive underground prison. Not all of those held hostage were concealed in tunnels, but many were, especially as the war ground on.Eli Sharabi, who became one of the most high profile of those taken, was first moved from a safe house into a tunnel after 52 of his 491 days in captivity. \"They tied us with ropes in our legs and hands,\" he told the BBC earlier this month. \"I fainted from time to time from the pain. One time they broke my ribs.\"By the time he was released, in February, he had lost more than 30kg (4st 10lb).EPAEli Sharabi, who was held hostage, was moved from a safe house into a tunnel. 'They tied us with ropes,' he has saidHamas used the hostages as bargaining chips, to secure ceasefires or the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. As negotiations over their fate continued, Hamas drip fed the Israeli public with a cruel series of videos, often showing the hostages in situations of extreme distress.Eventually it was, says Dr Yousef, internal and external pressure that forced Hamas to abandon the strategy.\"Qatar, Egypt and Turkey and also the people here in displacement camps sent a strong message to Hamas leaders outside that enough is enough.\"Getty ImagesIsrael assassinated Hamas's powerful leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran in July 2024In the meantime, Israel continues to destroy what it can of the tunnel network, often demolishing civilian neighbourhoods above in the process.And the job is far from done.\"According to publications from the defence establishment, estimates speak of damage to between 25% and 40% of the tunnels,\" says Yehuda Kfir, an Israeli civil engineer and underground warfare researcher at Haifa's Technion University.\"No doubt [Hamas] aspires to rehabilitate the infrastructure, including restoring tunnels that were dealt with in various ways by the IDF.\"A leadership in tattersRestoring tunnels is one thing. Reconstituting the organisation is another. After the events of the past two years, Hamas' leadership is in tatters.Israel has gone to enormous lengths - in Gaza, Iran, Lebanon and Qatar - to eliminate the group's key political and military figures. From its best known, internationally recognisable leaders, travelling the world to promote their cause, to its battalion commanders on the ground in Gaza, Hamas has lost almost everyone of consequence.Israel assassinated Hamas's powerful leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran in July 2024. Three months later, Haniyeh's successor, the elusive Yahya Sinwar, was killed in the ruins of a house in Rafah.ReutersIsmail Haniyeh (left) was assassinated in Tehran in July 2024, followed three months later by his successor Yahya Sinwar (centre). Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri (right) was killed in Beirut blastDespite the loss of these leading figures - and thousands of members of its armed wing - the group battled on, recruiting a fresh generation of radicalised young fighters and splintering into small cells intent on carrying out hit-and-run guerrilla-style operations.But Hamas in October 2025 is a pale shadow of the organisation that carried out the attacks of 7 October. Today's leaders are less well known and, crucially, have little political experience.Ezzedine al-Haddad, who is 55, now heads the five-member military council that commands Hamas' armed wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades.EPA/ ShutterstockMany of the group's key political and military figures have been killed. (L-R) Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Sheikh Ahmed YassinOutside Gaza, the remnants of the group's political leadership include Khaled Meshaal (the subject of a botched Israeli assassination attempt in Jordan in 1997), Khalil al-Hayya and Muhammad Darwish.All are believed to have escaped death on 9 September, when Israeli jets attacked a building in Doha, Qatar, where they were meeting to discuss the latest US ceasefire proposals.Hamas is 'tired of war'Despite the violence still raging in Gaza, the former Hamas adviser, Ahmed Yousef, says the group is tired of war. Without mentioning 7 October directly, he describes the cause of the war as a \"terrible mistake\" and that a \"different approach\" is needed.Anadolu via Getty ImagesPeople sit among the rubble and wreckage of war in Gaza. The former Hamas adviser, Ahmed Yousef, claims Hamas is also tired of war\"I'm talking to many of them and they have said that they are not interested in ruling Gaza anymore,\" he says. \"But Hamas has more than 100,000 members and those people are not going to disappear.\"Hamas, he suggests, is looking to rebrand itself in order to continue to play a political role in the future, a process he likens to the ANC's transition from guerrilla warfare to political rule in post-apartheid South Africa.\"If tomorrow there [are] elections,\" he says, \"I'm sure Hamas will come under different names, giving the impression it is more peaceful and more willing to be part of political life. \"Violence is not going to be part of any political party.\"Dr Milshtein is doubtful.\"Even if there will be a new local regime in Gaza, of course behind the scenes Hamas will be the dominant player,\" he argues.Anadolu via Getty ImagesIsrael may have to deal with Hamas for some time to comeDisarmament, he continues, is even less likely: he predicts another Gaza war within the next five years.But Ami Ayalon, the former Shin Bet chief, believes Israel should find another way to tackle its enemy.\"Unless we defeat the ideology, they will flourish,\" he says. \"The only way to defeat the ideology is by creating and presenting to the Palestinian and the Israeli people a new horizon. A horizon of two states.\"For now, that horizon does not exist, perhaps making Dr Milshtein's prediction more likely than Ami Ayalon's vision of a shared future.But Hamas, however diminished, is far from a spent force. One way or another, Israel may have to deal with it for some time to come.Additional reporting: BBC MonitoringTop picture credit: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "9 hours agoBasillioh Rukanga and Maia DaviesWatch: Four vehicles were involved in the crash on a major highway on the Kampala-Gulu HighwayForty-six people have been killed after several vehicles crashed on a major highway in Uganda, the police say.The police revised down an earlier death toll of 63, saying they had mistakenly included victims who were unconscious and were now being treated.The crash occurred when two buses travelling in opposite directions \"met head on\" while trying to overtake two other vehicles – a lorry and a car – on the Kampala-Gulu Highway at 00:15 local time (21:15 GMT), the Uganda Police Force said.One of the buses swerved in an attempt to avoid a crash, but in the process caused a \"head on and side collision\" that led to a \"chain reaction\" in which other vehicles lost control and overturned.As well as the fatalities, the passengers of the vehicles involved and several others were injured, police said. An investigation has been launched.The injured have been taken to different hospitals in the western town of Kiryandongo. In a statement, police said they were working with health and emergency services to verify the numbers and provide accurate updates as investigations continue into the cause of the tragedy.President Yoweri Museveni said he had learnt of the tragic accident \"with sadness\" and sent his condolences to the bereaved families. He urged caution to prevent such tragedies.He directed that each bereaved family be given five million shillings each ($1,430; £1,070) and a million shillings to the injured.The highway between the capital Kampala in the south and the northern city of Gulu is one of the country's busiest.Following the crash, police have urged motorists to avoid \"dangerous and careless overtaking\".It said this \"remains one of the leading causes of crashes in the country\".",

    "body": "Just nowBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseUS forces have struck another vessel alleged to be carrying drugs, this time in the waters of the Pacific Ocean, the Pentagon has confirmed. According to defence secretary Pete Hegseth, two people on board the vessel were killed. No US forces were harmed. The vessel was known to US intelligence and was believed to be carrying drugs along a known trafficking route in international waters, Hegseth added. The strike marks the eighth US strike against suspected drug boats since 2 September - but the first in the Pacific. Video of the strike appears to show a long, blue speed boat moving through the water before being struck by US ordinance. \"Narco-terrorists intending to bring position to our shores will find no safe harbour anywhere inour hemisphere,\" Hegseth wrote on X. \"Just as Al Qaeda wages war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our people.\" \"There will be no refuge or forgiveness - only justice,\" he added. In a leaked memo recently sent to US lawmakers, the Trump administration said it determined it was involved in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug-trafficking organisations.At least 34 people have been killed in the American strikes on alleged drug boats, including a recent strike on a semi-submersible vessel in the Caribbean.Two men survived a strike last week, and were repatriated to Colombia and Ecuador. Ecuador's government later released him - identified as Andrés Fernando Tufiño - saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing. The other man, from Colombia, reportedly remains hospitalised. US President Donald Trump and administration officials have repeatedly justified the strikes as counter-narcotics measures necessary to fight drug-trafficking organisations, several of which have been designated as terrorist organisations by the US. Citing a defence official, CBS has reported that the strike took place in international waters near Colombia.  News of the strike comes amid rising tensions between the Trump administration and the Colombian government of President Gustavo Petro. On Sunday, Trump denounced Petro as an \"illegal drug leader\" who is \"strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields, all over Colombia.\"Trump added that the US will no longer offer subsidies to Colombia, which has historically been one of its closest allies in Latin America. Both Colombia and nearby Ecuador have significant Pacific coastlines that experts have said are used to funnel drugs north towards the US through Central America and Mexico. US estimates from the Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, indicate that the vast majority of cocaine bound for US cities passes through the Pacific. Drug seizures in the Caribbean - where the bulk of confirmed US strikes have so far taken place - account for a relatively small percentage of the total, although US officials have warned it is rising.To date, US officials have offered few details on the identities of those killed in the strikes or what drug trafficking organisations they allegedly belong to.Around 10,000 US troops, as well as dozens of military aircraft and ships, have been deployed to the Caribbean as part of the operation.",

    "body": "6 hours agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent and Rachel HaganElon Musk's SpaceX says it has cut Starlink satellite communication links to more than 2,500 devices used by scam compounds in Myanmar.More than 30 compounds are believed to be operating along the Thai-Myanmar border, where people from around the world are trafficked and forced to work on scams generating tens of billions of dollars annually.Announcing the move, Lauren Dreyer, head of Starlink business operations, said the firm takes action on the rare occasion it identifies violations.The service's termination follows Monday's takeover of one of the largest compounds, KK Park, by the Myanmar military, as it retakes territory lost to insurgent groups over the past two years.Campaigners have long warned that Starlink technology has enabled the mainly Chinese crime syndicates to operate from remote locations along the border.Myanmar has become infamous for these operations, which defraud victims through romantic ploys and bogus investment schemes. Workers are lured under the guise of legitimate jobs, only to be held captive and forced into criminal activity.Survivors recount gruelling conditions, long hours, torture and beatings for failing to meet targets. Many of the victims come from African countries.\"In Myanmar... SpaceX proactively identified and disabled over 2,500 Starlink Kits in the vicinity of suspected 'scam centers',\" Dreyer said in a post on X.\"We are committed to ensuring the service remains a force for good and sustains trust worldwide: both connecting the unconnected and detecting and preventing misuse by bad actors,\" she added.On Monday Myanmar's military said it had \"cleared\" KK Park, releasing more than 2,000 workers and confiscating 30 Starlink terminals. Photographs show the satellite dishes on the compound's rooftops and footage supplied to the BBC showed thousands of workers leaving KK Park on foot.However, at least 30 other scam compounds remain active along the border, employing tens of thousands globally. Many are protected by militia groups loyal to the Myanmar military and it is unclear whether they have also lost access to Starlink services they once relied on.These centres have become a key component of Myanmar's wartime economy, as the junta battles various rebel groups while relying on Chinese support to maintain its hold on power.",

    "body": "Mosquitoes have been found in Iceland for the first time after the country experienced record-breaking heat this spring.Insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason encountered the mosquitoes over several nights last week while using wine-soaked ropes to observe moths, local media reported.Mr Hjaltason found two female mosquitoes and one male which were later confirmed to be Culiseta annulata, one of few species that can successfully survive winter.Iceland was one of only two mosquito-free havens in the world prior to the discovery, partly due to its cold climate. The only other recorded mosquito-free zone is Antarctica.The mosquitoes were found in Kjós, a glacial valley to the South West of the Icelandic capital of Reykjavik.Mr Hjaltason shared the news of his discovery on a Facebook page for local wildlife alongside pictures of the insects, describing \"a strange fly on a red wine ribbon\", according to Icelandic media.\"I could tell right away that this was something I had never seen before\" he said in the post, which was screenshotted and shared by Iceland's Morgunblaðið news site, adding \"the last fortress seems to have fallen.\"Mr Hjaltason sent the insects to the Icelandic Institute of Natural History to be identified, where entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson confirmed his suspicions.The species are common across parts of Europe and North Africa but it it isn't clear how they reached Iceland, Alfreðsson told CNN. Iceland's cold climate and lack of stagnant water in which the insects can breed are key contributors to the country's former lack of mosquitoes, the World Population Review said.But this year, the country broke multiple records for its high temperatures. Typically, Iceland rarely experiences highs of more than 20C (68F) in May, and when it does those heatwaves will last for no more than two to three days, its Met Office notes. That threshold was exceeded for 10 consecutive days this year in different parts of the country, though.Iceland also saw its hottest ever day in May, with temperatures reaching 26.6C (79.8F) at Eglisstaðir Airport.A June study published by the Global Heat Health Information Network noted that such shifts could have \"significant\" impacts on delicate ecosystems, which have adapted to the cold climate and are sensitive to temperature shifts.Last year was the world's hottest on record, and the UN's climate body has established that human influence has \"unequivocally\" warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land.Further monitoring will be required in spring to see if the mosquito species has \"truly become established in Iceland\", Alfreðsson added.Hjaltason, meanwhile, has speculated on the origin of the specimens he observed.\"One always suspects Grundartangi - it's only about six kilometers from me, and things often arrive with ships and containers, so it's possible something came in that way,\" he told Morgunblaðið.\"But if three of them came straight into my garden, there were probably more.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoPaul NjieBBC Africa, YaoundéJudges in Cameroon have dismissed calls for the partial or total cancellation of the heavily disputed presidential election, saying they will announce the result on Monday.Major cities in the country have been rocked by protests, with opposition supporters alleging that the 12 October poll was marred by irregularities, including ballot-stuffing. Judges on the Constitutional Council dismissed eight petitions, citing insufficient evidence of irregularities or a lack of jurisdiction to annul results. Opposition candidate Issa Tchiroma Bakary has declared himself the winner - a claim rejected by allies of 92-year-old President Paul Biya, who is seeking another seven-year term.Biya has been in power for 43 years, and addressed only one campaign rally ahead of the election. Tchiroma Bakary, 76, is a former government spokesman who broke ranks with Biya to challenge him for power. He refused to file complaints with the Constitutional Council, whose judges have been appointed by Biya, choosing instead to declare himself the \"legal and legitimate president\". Can the world's oldest president keep his title?The African president who keeps defying death rumoursIn a video statement posted on social media, Tchiroma Bakary said he had won the election with about 55% of the vote, based on what he waid were returns representing 80% of the electorate.\"If the Constitutional Council proclaims falsified and truncated results, it will be complicit in a breach of trust,\" he declared.Tchiroma Bakary also warned that \"with their backs against the wall, the people will have no choice but to take their destiny into their own hands and seek victory wherever they can find it\".Biya's ruling party has dismissed his claims of victory and several officials have described it as illegal because only the Constitutional Council can proclaim official results.The influential Catholic Church this week urged the judges to ensure that the verdict reflected the will of voters.The growing tensions have sparked fears of post-electoral violence in a country already rocked by a separatist conflict in the Anglophone regions and Boko Haram insurgency in the Far North region.",

    "body": "1 day agoLucy WilliamsonMiddle East Correspondent, JerusalemUnder Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza, the \"yellow line\" - which Israel withdrew to earlier this month - is the first of three stages of Israeli military withdrawal. It leaves it in control of about 53% of the Gaza Strip.One Israeli newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, referred to it as \"effectively the new border\" in Gaza.It's a remark that will please the far-right coalition partners of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.The fortifications and demarcations Israel is now building along this boundary are meant to clearly divide the territory, but they may also help to blur the differing hopes and expectations of Mr Netanyahu's allies in Washington and at home.How long he can keep both sets of expectations in play depends largely on this next stage of negotiations.The boundary marked by the yellow line is temporary, but further withdrawal of Israeli forces rests on resolving the difficult issues pinned to the second stage of Donald Trump's deal – including the transfer of power in Gaza and the process for disarming Hamas.Washington is keen that nothing upset this next delicate stage of negotiations. US Vice-President JD Vance flew in on Tuesday to push Netanyahu to press on with peace talks. Trump's negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner met with the Israeli PM on Monday.Israeli newspapers have been reporting that Netanyahu is receiving a stern message from his American allies to \"show restraint\" and not to endanger the ceasefire.When Israel complained that Hamas had violated the terms of the ceasefire on Sunday, killing two soldiers, the response advocated by Mr Netanyahu's far-right National Security Minister was a one-word demand: \"War\".Instead, Israel carried out an intense, but brief, wave of air strikes, before reinstating the truce, and was careful to emphasise that its troops had been attacked inside the yellow line – keen to show Washington that Israel had not broken the rules.Netanyahu has said the war will not end until Hamas is dismantled – its disarmament, and the full demilitarisation of Gaza, are among the conditions he has set.But Israeli commentators are lining up to say that the real decisions over Israel's military action in Gaza are now being made in Washington.The yellow line – and the daunting task facing negotiators in this second stage of the deal – are clues as to why Netanyahu's coalition partners have chosen to wait, rather than carry out a threat to bring down his government.The dream for many extremist settlers – and ministers – is that the next stage of this process will prove impossible to resolve and the yellow line will indeed become the de facto border, opening the way to new settlements on Gazan land. Some hardliners would like Israel to annex the whole of the Gaza Strip.The vast majority of Israelis want an end to the war and for the remaining bodies of the hostages, and Israel's serving soldiers, to come home.But Israel's prime minister is known as a politician who likes to keep his options as open as possible, for as long as possible, and this is a deal in stages, with caveats built in.Agreeing to this first stage meant withdrawing to positions that left Israel in control of more than half of Gaza, and agreeing to a ceasefire in order to get hostages home.From here, it will become harder to align the goals of his US and domestic allies.Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly underlined that violations of the deal by Hamas – including its failure to disarm – would allow Israel to return to war.\"If this is achieved the easy way, so much the better,\" he told the Israeli public earlier this month. \"If not, it will be achieved the hard way.\"Donald Trump has said the same.  But Washington has so far shown a tolerance for delays and violations in implementing the deal on the ground, leaving Netanyahu with far less political room than perhaps he'd like.",

    "body": "14 hours agoNikita YadavBBC News, DelhiUS President Donald Trump has reiterated that India has agreed to reduce its purchase of Russian crude.Trump said Indian PM Narendra Modi had assured him during a phone call on Tuesday that Delhi \"was not going to buy much oil from Russia\" as he too \"wants to see the war end with Russia-Ukraine\".Modi acknowledged Trump's call and his \"warm greetings\" on the festival of Diwali in a social media post but didn't comment on Russian oil.Trump had made similar remarks last week, but the Indian foreign ministry said at the time said it was \"not aware\" of any phone call between the leaders. On Wednesday, an official at the ministry told the BBC that it had no new comment on Trump's latest remarks.\"I spoke to Prime Minister Modi today, as I mentioned before. And we just have a very good relationship. And he's not going to buy much oil from Russia,\" Trump told reporters during the White House Diwali celebrations on Tuesday. \"He wants to see the war end with Russia-Ukraine. And, as you know, they're not going to be buying too much oil. So they've cut it way back and they're continuing to cut it way back.\" India became one of the biggest markets for Russian oil as Western nations shunned purchases and imposed sanctions on Moscow after the Ukraine war started in 2022. Delhi increased its imports and bought Russian crude at discounted prices, saying the decision was vital to provide energy security to millions of its people. Delhi has also pointed out that many Western nations, including the US, continue to have trade ties with Russia.Cheap oil, high stakes: Can India do without Russia?India casts doubt on Trump's claim Modi will stop buying Russian oilIn recent months, US officials have accused Delhi of helping to fund Russia's war against Ukraine by continuing to buy crude oil, a claim that Delhi denies.The Trump administration has put both public and diplomatic pressure on Delhi to reduce its support for Moscow's energy market, as part of efforts to economically isolate the Kremlin and push for an end to the war in Ukraine. Oil and gas are Russia's largest exports, and Moscow's biggest customers include China, India and Turkey.As part of this pressure, the US has imposed 50% tariffs - including an additional 25% as a penalty for buying Russian oil -  on Indian goods.However, the US president's tone has softened in recent days as trade negotiations between the two countries progress.Last week, an Indian government spokesman said discussions were \"ongoing\" with the US administration which had \"shown interest in deepening energy co-operation with India\".India has been locked in high-stakes trade talks with the US aimed at reaching a long-sought deal in the coming months.Meanwhile, a report in the Mint newspaper suggested that a deal could be announced soon and \"India may agree to gradually reduce its imports of Russian oil\", citing three sources familiar with the matter.The BBC has reached out to India's commerce ministry for a comment.

    "body": "7 hours agoKhanyisile NgcoboJohannesburgSouth African authorities have suspended eight pupils linked to a case of alleged bullying that has caused national outrage.A video showing a horrific assault at Milnerton high school in Cape Town last week has been widely shared on social media.Several boys are seen repeatedly hitting a fellow pupil with various objects, including a hockey stick, hose pipe and belt. According to reports, the boy was one of nine allegedly assaulted.Angry parents gathered outside the school on Wednesday in protest and were dispersed by police firing tear gas.They were joined by members of political parties who announced planned demonstrations at the school.Bullying in schools is a significant problem in South Africa, with videos depicting the violent attacks often going viral. This latest clip is among the most horrific to emerge in recent years.The mother of the 16-year-old boy being attacked in the video told local online publication, News24, that her son had had cancer and had completed his chemotherapy earlier this year.\"My child had just beaten cancer [only] for something like this to happen to him,\" she is quoted as saying.The teen's uncle later told local broadcaster eNCA that the boy had since been removed from the school.Various organisations have also condemned the incident, which took place on 16 October, while the police have confirmed that an assault case has been opened.Among those to speak out was Amnesty International South Africa, which said the video was \"deeply disturbing\" and called for \"timely disciplinary action\".The video, which is just over two minutes long, shows the boy pleading with his attackers to stop hitting him. While he makes this impassioned plea, one of the boys hits him again with a belt, eliciting laughter from some of the others. Some of the boys are also seen making funny faces and cheering the boy's attackers as the camera pans across the room.\"No child should ever endure such brutality in a space where [pupils] should be safe and protected from harm,\" the international human rights organisation said in a post on X.South Africa's education ministry said it had been in contact with the Western Cape education department, which has oversight over the school, and confirmed that the suspended pupils would face disciplinary action.The provincial department said it was \"treating the matter with the seriousness it warrants\".Both bodies have urged the public not to share the video of the assault or details of those involved, saying that this \"not only exacerbates the trauma experienced by the victim but also undermines the rights and dignity of all the [pupils] involved\".The chairperson of parliament's education committee also shared her \"utter horror and deep concern\" over the video.Joy Maimela said that the incident \"is not merely bullying but borders on assault – a criminal offence that demands urgent and decisive action from all relevant authorities\".",

    "body": "At least 42 people have been killed in an oil tanker explosion in Nigeria's central Niger state after the vehicle skidded off the road and crashed, spilling fuel, an aid worker has told the BBC.Another 52 people with varying degrees of injuries are currently receiving treatment at a hospital, said Abdullahi Baba Ara, head of the Niger state emergency service.Villagers rushed to collect fuel from the overturned tanker which suddenly exploded, setting off a massive fire that engulfed them. Tanker explosions are a recurring tragedy in Nigeria, despite repeated warnings about the dangers of collecting spilled fuel. The intense blaze burned many victims beyond recognition, and the injured were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.The accident occurred near the Essan and Badeggi communities along the Bida-Agaie road in the Katcha Local Government Area of Niger state.The Nigerian truckers risking attackDriver of burning fuel tanker honoured for heroismNiger State Governor Mohammed Umaru Bago sent his condolences to the people, describing the incident as \"worrisome, unfortunate and pathetic\".\"[It] is disheartening how people have continued to approach a fallen tanker to scoop its contents\" despite several awareness campaigns, said a statement by his chief press secretary Bologi Ibrahim.The tanker, carrying petroleum products from Lagos in southern Nigeria to the north, is said to have crashed due to the bad condition of the road.Poor road conditions are a major contributor to road accidents in the country.In October last year, a fuel tanker explosion killed 153 people in Jigawa state, north-west Nigeria.In January this year, a truck carrying about 60,000 litres of petrol overturned near Suleja, also in Niger state, killing at least 86 people and injuring nearly 70 others.",

    "body": "UN's top court says Israel obliged to allow UN aid into Gaza43 minutes agoDavid GrittenReutersThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) has said Israel has a legal obligation to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip by the UN and its entities to ensure the basic needs of Palestinian civilians there are met.An advisory opinion from the UN's top court also said Israel had not substantiated its allegations that the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) lacked neutrality or that a significant number of its staff were members of Hamas or other armed groups.The UN's chief said he hoped Israel would abide by the \"very important decision\".But Israel rejected the ICJ's opinion as \"political\" and insisted it would not co-operate with Unrwa, which it has banned.The opinion is non-binding, but it carries significant moral and diplomatic weight.In December, the UN General Assembly asked the ICJ for an opinion on Israel's obligations, as an occupying power and a member of the UN, towards UN agencies and other international organisations operating in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem.It came after the Israeli parliament passed laws banning any activity by Unrwa on Israeli territory and contact with Israeli officials.The ICJ was asked to also cover in its opinion Israel's duty to allow the unhindered delivery of essential supplies to Palestinian civilians.Israel tightened its blockade on Gaza after the start of its war with Hamas two years ago and has since restricted - and at times completely stopped - the entry of food and other aid for the 2.1 million population.Before this month's ceasefire deal took effect, UN-backed global experts had warned that more than 640,000 people were facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity and that there was an \"entirely man-made\" famine in Gaza City.Israel rejected the famine declaration, insisting it was allowing in sufficient food.The ICJ's President Yuji Iwasawa read out its advisory opinion at The Hague on Wednesday.He said the panel of 11 international judges agreed that Israel, as an occupying power, was required to fulfil its obligations under international humanitarian law.The first obligation was to \"ensure that the population of the Occupied Palestinian Territory has the essential supplies of daily life, including food, water, clothing, bedding, shelter, fuel, medical supplies and services\", according to the judge.The second was to \"agree to and facilitate by all means at its disposal relief schemes on behalf of the population of the Occupied Palestinian Territory so long as that population is inadequately supplied, as has been the case in the Gaza Strip\".The other obligations listed included respecting the prohibitions on forcible transfer from an occupied territory and on the use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare.Judge Iwasawa said the panel were also of the opinion that Israel had \"an obligation to co-operate in good faith with the United Nations by providing every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, including [Unrwa]\".Israel was also obliged to ensure \"full respect for the privileges and immunities accorded to the United Nations\" and its officials, as well as for the \"inviolability of the premises of the United Nations... and for the immunity of the property and assets of the organisation from any form of interference\", he added.ReutersYuji Iwasawa, the president of the International Court of Justice, read out the advisory opinionWhen asked about the advisory opinion in Geneva, UN Secretary General António Guterres said: \"This is a very important decision. And I hope that Israel will abide by it.\"He added that the advisory opinion came at a moment in which the UN was doing everything it could to boost aid deliveries to Gaza and deal with the \"tragic situation\" there.Israel's foreign ministry said it categorically rejected the advisory opinion, describing it as \"entirely predictable from the outset regarding Unrwa\".\"This is yet another political attempt to impose political measures against Israel under the guise of 'international law',\" it added.The ministry also said Israel was fully upholding its obligations under international law and that it would \"not co-operate with an organisation that is infested with terror activities\".Unrwa - the largest humanitarian organisation in Gaza, with 12,000 Palestinian staff based there - has repeatedly denied Israel's allegation that it is deeply infiltrated by Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other countries.Israel has said that Unrwa staff took part in the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken to Gaza as hostages, and claimed that the agency still employs more than 1,400 \"Hamas operatives\".The UN said last year that it had fired nine of Unrwa's staff in Gaza after investigators found evidence that they might have been involved in the 7 October attack. Another 10 staff were cleared because of insufficient evidence.Judge Iwasawa said the information the ICJ received was \"not sufficient to establish Unrwa's lack of neutrality\", and that Israel had \"not substantiated its allegations that a significant part of Unrwa employees 'are members of Hamas... or other terrorist factions'\".ReutersThe UN's World Food Programme said on Tuesday that around 750 tonnes of supplies a day were crossing into Gaza under the ceasefire dealSince the Israeli laws banning Unrwa took effect in January, the agency says its Palestinian staff have continued providing assistance and education, health and other services to Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. However, the agency says Israel has banned it from bringing aid into Gaza and stopped issuing visas to Unrwa's international staff.Unrwa says at least 309 of its staff and 72 people supporting the agency's activities have been killed since the start of the war in Gaza. The territory's Hamas-run health ministry says Israeli attacks during the conflict have killed at least 68,229 people in total.Unrwa's acting Gaza director, Sam Rose, told the BBC that the agency welcomed the advisory opinion because it \"underscores the obligations of Israel under international law\".\"The ruling of today says that Israel's laws against Unrwa have gone against those obligations, as have its actions on the ground,\" he said.The Palestinian foreign ministry said the advisory opinion made \"very clear that Israel must cease these illegal policies and that states have an obligation to bring Israel into compliance with its obligations in this regard\".\"Israel must immediately lift the unlawful ban on Unrwa and allow all other international organisations invited by Palestine to operate freely and safely,\" it added.",

    "body": "2 days agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterGetty ImagesMuch of Virginia Giuffre's story has been heard before but in her memoir, published posthumously, the abuse is described in appalling detail.Two days ahead of the book's official publication, the BBC got hold of a copy.There are revelations about Ms Giuffre's encounters with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell - as well as more details of her allegations about Prince Andrew, which he has always denied.Here's what we learned from the 367-page-long book.Prince Andrew allegations - and an 'orgy'In the memoir, Ms Giuffre says she had sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions.The third time, she says, was on Epstein's island as part of what Ms Giuffre called \"an orgy\".\"Epstein, Andy, and approximately eight other young girls and I had sex together,\" she says.\"The other girls all appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn't really speak English. Epstein laughed about how they couldn't really communicate, saying they are the easiest girls to get along with.\"She later recalls seeing the photo of Epstein walking in New York's central park with Prince Andrew, published in newspapers around the world in 2011.\"I was of course revolted to see two of my abusers together, out for a stroll,\" she writes.\"But mostly I was amazed that a member of the Royal Family would be stupid enough to appear in public with Epstein\".Prince Andrew, who reached a financial settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. In 2019, he told BBC Newsnight he did not remember meeting Ms Giuffre \"at all\", and that they \"never had any sort of sexual contact.\"News Syndication'Epstein told me I'd had a miscarriage'Shortly after the alleged \"orgy\" Ms Giuffre says she \"wasn't in great shape\", and had irregular bleeding and a tenderness in her abdomen.She says Epstein took her to a hospital, where she remembers being taken to an examination room. However, she says she is unclear what happened next due to pain medication affecting her memory.Soon after, she writes, one of the other girls in Epstein's house suggested to her that an incision mark near her belly button could mean she had surgery for an ectopic pregnancy.\"But Epstein told me I'd suffered a miscarriage, which is altogether something different,\" Ms Giuffre says.\"Epstein never wore a condom. Neither did the men he and Maxwell trafficked me to.\"Memories of Epstein 'torture' GiuffreAt the centre of the abuse was the late Epstein and his former girlfriend Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year sentence on sex-trafficking charges.Ms Giuffre says that even after many years, the memories of what Epstein put her through \"torture\" her - and says she she feared she might \"die a sex slave\" at the hands of Epstein and his circle.The memoir includes shocking descriptions of sadomasochistic sex.She says Epstein developed an interest in it over time, and began to \"experiment with whips and restraints and other instruments of torture\".\"In session after session, he would play out various fantasies, with me as the victim,\" she writes.She says the chains and contraptions he used on her \"caused so much pain that I prayed I would black out\". But she adds: \"When I did, I'd awaken to more abuse\".Ms Giuffre also details the physical effects such abuse had on her body, with dark circles under her eyes and her ribs visible beneath her skin.Rather than offering any care, Epstein was \"disgusted\" at her appearance, she says.\"'You're not the same girl you were,' Epstein said coldly. 'You need to clean yourself up',\" she writes in the book.Maxwell's part in the abuseMs Giuffre goes into detail about how she first met Maxwell, and how she introduced her to Epstein.She says Maxwell turned up at the Mar-a-Lago spa, where a teenage Ms Giuffre was working.\"She looks to be in her late thirties, and her British accent reminds me of Mary Poppins,\" Ms Giuffre recalls.She says Maxwell asked her to come for a job interview as a masseuse.When she arrived at the house, Ms Giuffre says she was taken to a room where Epstein was completely naked on a massage table. \"Just do what I do,\" she says Maxwell told her.Ms Giuffre says she started giving Epstein a massage. She says Maxwell then took her clothes off, and undressed Ms Giuffre, and they sexually abused her.\"The disappointment was excruciating. I blamed myself. 'Is sex all anyone will ever want from me',\" she writes.She later describes how Maxwell facilitated the introduction to Prince Andrew in March 2001.She writes that Maxwell woke her up and told her it was going to be a \"special day\" - that \"just like Cinderella\" she was going to meet a \"handsome prince\".Ms Giuffre later writes that even decades later, she remembers how much she feared both Epstein and Maxwell.Disappointment at Epstein's deathOne of the other themes running through the book is Ms Giuffre's desire for accountability.Epstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a person under the age of 18. He died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.Ms Giuffre describes feeling disappointed at his death. \"This wasn't how justice was supposed to work out,\" she says.On Prince Andrew, she recalls standing outside a courtroom and telling journalists: \"He knows exactly what he's done… and I hope he comes clean about it.\"She later writes that she hopes the royal - who has always denied wrongdoing - will be \"held to account\".The most powerful words are perhaps saved for the ending of the book.\"In my mind, I hold a picture of a girl reaching out for help and easily finding it,\" Ms Giuffre writes.\"I picture a woman, too, who - having come to terms with her childhood pain - feels that it's within her power to take action against those who hurt her.\"If this book moves us even an inch closer to a reality like that - if it helps just one person - I will have achieved my goal.\"",

    "body": "Kevin Federline has held off writing about Britney Spears. Until now1 day agoAna Faguy, James FitzGerald and Nardine SaadGetty ImagesThe pair's divorce was finalised in 2007The ex-husband of pop star Britney Spears gives new details on the pair's tense relationship in his new memoir You Thought You Knew.Kevin Federline, her one-time backing dancer, presents a picture of Spears's allegedly erratic behaviour as a wife and mother, and says he continues to have concerns for her wellbeing.Spears has spoken out against the book, which will be published on Tuesday, and accuses Federline of trying to profit from his association with her.Federline makes a number of allegations against Spears, in the memoir shared with the BBC ahead of the book's release by publisher Listenin. He accuses Spears of unhealthy behaviour as a mother, including drinking when she was pregnant and taking cocaine while her two sons were still breastfeeding. Spears has previously denied having substance abuse issues.When they were teenagers, the couple's sons were fearful of Spears, Federline also alleges. \"They would awaken sometimes at night to find her standing silently in the doorway, watching them sleep - 'Oh, you're awake?' - with a knife in her hand,\" he writes. \"Then she'd turn around and pad off without explanation.\"Federline also expresses his concern for his estranged ex-wife, writing: \"The truth is, this situation with Britney feels like it's racing toward something irreversible. From where I sit, the clock is ticking, and we're getting close to the 11th hour.\"He writes that he was supportive of a conservatorship, under which many aspects of Spears's life were controlled by others for years, and described it as a \"lifeline\" in its early days.He claims Spears saw the events in her life \"through a prism that painted her as the victim, the misunderstood one\", but that she \"needed help\" and was \"in no state to responsibly manage her own affairs\".Of the Free Britney movement, Federline writes that he could \"never fully get behind it\".What's the history of their relationship?The pair got together in the summer of 2004, as Spears's initial commercial peak started to wane.They married a few months later and quickly welcomed their two sons: Preston, now 20, and Jayden, now 19.Spears filed for divorce in 2006 and the divorce was finalised in 2007.The couple fought publicly over custody of their sons and ultimately Federline was given sole custody of the boys.In the wake of Federline getting full custody, Spears was seen behaving in a way that Federline characterises in his book as erratic.She made headlines with incidents like shaving her head and hitting a photographer's car with an umbrella.Those public incidents raised concern about her mental welfare, and after she was taken to hospital twice, a temporary conservatorship was established in 2008 and made permanent later that year.Spears remained under that controversial arrangement until 2021, under which her father and others controlled her finances and aspects of her personal life. She did not regain custody of her children until after it was lifted.Federline recalls that time as being \"like watching someone slowly lose control of their life\".\"I've lost faith that things will ever fully turn around, but I still hope that Britney can find peace,\" he adds.What has Spears said? Spears has accused Federline of attacking her during his recent press appearances to promote the book. She described the contents of the memoir as \"extremely hurtful and exhausting\", but suggested the work would sell better than her own memoir had done.In that book, The Woman in Me, Spears accused her ex-husband of trying to \"convince everyone I was completely out of control\".Spears has also defended her relationship with her sons. \"I have always pleaded and screamed to have a life with my boys,\" she wrote on social media on 15 October, adding that \"relationships with teenage boys is complex\".In a statement to US media, a Spears spokesperson added: \"With news from Kevin's book breaking, once again he and others are profiting off her and sadly it comes after child support has ended with Kevin. All she cares about are her kids, Sean Preston and Jayden James, and their well-being during this sensationalism. She detailed her journey in her memoir.\"The BBC has contacted Federline's lawyer for comment on Spears's counter-accusations.Why is this happening now?While the pair dominated headlines during their relationship and subsequent divorce, Federline in particular has largely remained out of the limelight in recent years. And recently, the spotlight on Spears has largely been over her social media postings.Federline has said he considered writing a book for many years but wanted to wait until his children were older to complete it because he did not want make the weight of the world \"heavier\" on their shoulders.\"This is about finally telling my story,\" he writes. \"My version. In my words. Because everybody else has done it for me. The media. The blogs. The exes. The strangers. The jokes. The headlines. They all had something to say about me. And I stayed quiet.\"He denies claims that he \"was just coasting off her money\" and insists he was \"out there hustling, grinding, investing —working to build a solid foundation for myself and my kids\".He says he avoided responding publicly to media reports about him over the years because he wanted to protect his loved ones and give his kids \"some kind of normal life\".\"But silence didn't bring peace. It left me choking on the words I never said,\" he adds.",

    "body": "22 hours agoLaura GozziWatch: \"I don't want to have a wasted meeting\", says Trump on talks with PutinDonald Trump has said he did not want a \"wasted meeting\" after a plan to have face-to-face talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin about the war in Ukraine was put on hold.The US president indicated that a key sticking point remained Moscow's refusal to cease fighting along the current front line, in remarks at the White House on Tuesday.Earlier, a White House official had said there were \"no plans\" for a Trump-Putin meeting \"in the immediate future\", after Trump said on Thursday that the two would hold talks in Budapest within two weeks.Key differences between US and Russian proposals for peace became increasingly clear this week, appearing to have dashed chances of a summit.Trump and Putin last met in Alaska in August, during a hastily organised summit which yielded no concrete results.The White House decision to shelve plans for a second Trump-Putin meeting may be seen as an attempt to avoid another similar scenario.\"I guess the Russians wanted too much and it became evident for the Americans that there will be no deal for Trump in Budapest,\" a senior European diplomat told Reuters.A preparatory meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was due to be held this week - but the White House said the two had had a \"productive\" call and that a meeting was no longer \"necessary\".On Monday, Trump embraced a ceasefire proposal backed by Kyiv and European leaders to freeze the conflict on the current front line.\"Let it be cut the way it is,\" he said. \"I said: cut and stop at the battle line. Go home. Stop fighting, stop killing people.\"Russia has repeatedly pushed back against freezing the current line of contact.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the idea had been put to the Russians repeatedly but that \"the consistency of Russia's position doesn't change\" – referring to Moscow's insistence on the complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the embattled eastern regions.Moscow was only interested in \"long-term, sustainable peace\", Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday, implying that freezing the front line would only amount to a temporary ceasefire.The \"root causes of the conflict\" needed to be addressed, Lavrov said, using Kremlin shorthand for a series of maximalist demands that include the recognition of full Russian sovereignty over the Donbas as well as the demilitarisation of Ukraine – a non-starter for Kyiv and its European partners.European leaders released a statement with Zelensky earlier on Tuesday saying that any talks on ending the war in Ukraine should start with freezing the current front line and accused Russia of not being \"serious\" about peace.Zelensky said discussions about the front line were the \"beginning of diplomacy\",  which Russia was doing everything to avoid.The only topic that could make Moscow \"pay attention\" was the supply of long-range weapons to Ukraine, he added.Trump had discussed a summit in the Hungarian capital over the phone with Putin, a day before meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House.Some reports suggested those talks had been a \"shouting match\", with sources suggesting Trump had pushed Zelensky to give up large areas of territory in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, known collectively as the Donbas, as part of a deal with Russia.However, Zelensky has always said Ukraine cannot relinquish the parts of the Donbas it still holds, on the grounds that Russia could later use the area as a springboard for further attacks.Putin's unscheduled call with Trump last Thursday came following speculation that the US was preparing to send long-range Tomahawk missiles to Kyiv that could potentially strike deep into Russia.Zelensky said it was the Tomahawks issue that had forced Russia to engage in discussion. Despite coming away from the White House empty-handed, he added that the talk about the missiles had turned out to be a \"strong investment in diplomacy\".Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "'Fatal combination' of disease, injuries and famine in Gaza is generational crisis, WHO tells BBC15 hours agoSean Seddon, Wahiba Ahmed and Anna FosterGaza health crisis will last 'for generations', says WHO chiefGaza is experiencing a health \"catastrophe\" that will last for \"generations to come\", the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned.Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a massive increase in aid is needed to begin to address the complex needs of the Strip's population.Israel has allowed more medical supplies and other aid to cross into Gaza since a ceasefire with Hamas came into effect on 10 October, but Dr Tedros said levels are below those needed to rebuild the territory's healthcare system.His intervention comes as the US attempts to shore up the ceasefire it helped to broker following an outbreak of violence at the weekend.Listen: Full Today interview with Dr Tedros Adhanom GhebreyesusThe agreement has been described by the White House as the first phase of a 20-point peace plan that includes an increase to the amount of aid entering Gaza, and supplies distributed \"without interference\" from either side.Dr Tedros told the Today programme he welcomed the ceasefire deal but said the increase in aid that followed has been smaller than expected.Asked about the situation on the ground, he said Gazans had experienced famine, \"overwhelming\" injuries, a collapsed healthcare system, and outbreaks of disease fuelled by the destruction of water and sanitation infrastructure.He continued: \"On top of that, [there is] restricted access to humanitarian aid. This is a very fatal combination, so that makes [the situation] catastrophic and beyond words.\"Asked about long-term health prospects in Gaza, he added: \"If you take the famine and combine it with a mental health problem which we see is rampant, then the situation is a crisis for generations to come.\"Tom Fletcher, head of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said earlier this week that aid groups are \"turning the tide on the starvation crisis\" but that \"far more\" was needed.On Tuesday, the UN's World Food Programme said lorries carrying more than 6,700 tonnes of food had entered since 10 October, but that was still considerably below its 2,000-tonnes-a-day target.Six hundred aid lorries a day need to be arriving in Gaza but the average is between 200 and 300, Dr Tedros said, as he called on Israeli authorities to \"de-link\" aid and the wider conflict.ReutersPeople were seen collecting boxes containing World Food Programme aid in central Gaza on TuesdayOn Sunday, Israel temporarily halted aid deliveries after it said two Israeli troops were killed in an attack by Hamas gunmen in Gaza. Hamas said at the time it was not aware of the clashes.The Israeli military responded with a series of air strikes across the territory, killing dozens of Palestinians.The aid deliveries resumed the following day after heavy international pressure.Dr Tedros said aid should not be \"weaponised\" and called on Israel not to impose conditions on its delivery, including over the return of the remains of dead hostages still in Gaza, which has become a key point of contention during the ceasefire.Hamas has committed to returning the bodies but so far has transferred only 15 of 28, saying it has not been able to retrieve the rest.Twenty living Israeli hostages were released by Hamas last week in exchange for almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails.Dr Tedros told Today: \"There should be full access, there should not be any condition, especially after all the living hostages were released, and a good part of the remains are transferred. I did not expect there would be additional restrictions.\"Asked about the role the US should play, Dr Tedros said \"since the US has brokered the peace deal it has the responsibility of making sure that all sides are respecting\" it.Israel is currently operating two crossings - Kerem Shalom in the south-east, and Kissufim in central Gaza - but it has continued to face calls from aid groups for all the access routes it controls to be restored. Dr Tedros said \"all available crossings\" were needed to get enough aid into Gaza, and called on Israel to allow aid groups previously been denied registration back into the territory, saying: \"You can't have a scaled up response without those who can deliver on the ground.\"ReutersMajor aid groups have called for the number of lorries carrying aid supplies into Gaza to be increased more quickly He also said supplies intended be used to restore Gaza's health system have been confiscated at the border because Israeli authorities say they could have a military use.\"If you are going to build a field hospital, you need the canvas and the pillars [for tents],\" he continued. \"So if the pillars are removed, because of an excuse that they could be dual-use, then you can't have a tent.\"Thousands of Palestinians are waiting for weekly medical evacuation flights, Dr Tedros said, though none have taken off for two weeks due to religious holidays in Israel. He said 700 people have previously died while waiting for medical evacuation and called on the number of flights to be increased. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others as hostages.At least 68,229 have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.In July, a UN-backed body concluded that famine had occurred in Gaza, though Israel disputed the findings, saying there was \"no starvation\".The UN has previously estimated it will cost $70bn (£52bn) to reconstruct Gaza. Dr Tedros said around 10% of that figure would need to be spent on its badly damaged health system.He continued: \"We have been saying for a long time that peace is the best medicine.\"The ceasefire we have is a very fragile one and some people have died even after the ceasefire because it was broken a couple of times.\"What is very sad is many people were cheering in the streets because they were very happy there was a peace deal. Imagine, [some of] those same people are dead after they were told the war is over.\"",

    "body": "Google's parent company Alphabet will invest $15bn (£11.29bn) to build an AI data hub in southern India's Andhra Pradesh state.The facility, which will be set up in the port city of Visakhapatnam, will be part of Google's global network of AI centres spread across 12 countries.\"It's the largest AI hub that we are going to be investing in anywhere in the world, outside of the United States,\" Thomas Kurian, the CEO of Google Cloud, said at an event in the capital Delhi on Tuesday, adding that the investment will be spread over the next five years.The announcement comes at a time when US President Donald Trump has been asking American companies to prioritise domestic investment.India has emerged as a key destination for AI data centres. The country's low data costs and rapidly growing internet user base have made it a hub for cloud and AI expansion for tech giants.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said the facility \"will bring our industry-leading technology to enterprises and users in India, accelerating AI innovation and driving growth across the country\".A formal agreement to finalise the project will be signed on Tuesday, the Andhra Pradesh government said.\"It is a massive leap for our state's digital future, innovation, and global standing,\" said the state's technology minister Nara Lokesh.The project will combine cloud and AI infrastructure with renewable energy systems and an expanded fibre-optic network.The project is part of the Andhra Pradesh government's plan to develop 6GW of data centre capacity by 2029, according to Bloomberg News. Data centres are physical facilities that house the computing and networking equipment that organisations use to collect, process, store, and distribute data. They contain servers, storage systems and network equipment like routers and firewalls, along with the necessary power and cooling systems to operate them.In Andhra Pradesh, the government has been offering subsidised land and electricity to attract global investors.India's data centre industry has grown rapidly over the past five years, crossing the 1GW capacity mark in 2024 and nearly tripling its 2019 level, according to global professional service firm JLL's India Data Centre Market Dynamics 2024 report.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "Three police officers have been killed and at least 15 other people injured in an apparently deliberate gas explosion at a farmhouse in northern Italy.The blast was triggered as police and firefighters went into the house near Verona to carry out an eviction order for two brothers and a sister in their late 50s and mid-60s. The three victims who died were members of the Carabinieri military police. A man and a woman were arrested at the scene and another man who fled after the explosion was located soon after. All three have been taken to hospital. The blast could be heard some 5km (3 miles) away and images from the scene showed the building reduced to a pile of rubble. The head of the Veneto region, Luca Zaia, said the farmhouse was subject to an eviction order due to debts accrued by the three owners.\"This is a time for grieving,\" said Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi, who added that attempts had been made to evict the three siblings in the past. \"It was clear we were dealing with people who would resist in some way,\" he said. Mediators had been sent to speak to the siblings who had barricaded themselves into the house. When the Carabinieri arrived shortly after 03:00 (01:00 GMT), officials believe one of the siblings triggered the blast.\"Upon entering the house, we were confronted with an act of absolute madness,\" provincial police commander Claudio Papagno told the Ansa news agency.\"A gas cylinder had been ignited, and the explosion directly hit our officers,\" he said.Petrol bombs were also found at the property, the interior minister said.Those injured by the blast included 11 other members of the Carabinieri and well as three members of Italy's state police and a firefighter, Ansa reported.According to the Verona prosecutor, Raffaele Tito, the farmhouse was in a derelict state and had no electricity. The prosecutor believed the blast had taken place on a floor above the entrance and told reporters it was a \"premeditated and voluntary homicide\". Shortly before the explosion, he said officers had \"heard a whistle, probably the gas cylinders being opened\".\"We all knew the situation was dire,\" neighbours told Italian media, adding that the three had previously threatened to \"blow themselves up\" rather than leave the house.Piantedosi said the explosion had left a \"terrible, very painful and dramatic toll\".Defence Minister Guido Crosetto joined other political leaders in paying tribute to the three men who had lost their lives in the service of their country.",

    "body": "Venezuela announced on Monday it would close its embassy in Oslo, days after opposition leader María Corina Machado was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.In a statement, the Venezuelan government did not comment on Machado's prize, saying that the closure was part of a restructuring of its foreign service.Norway's foreign ministry confirmed that Caracas had closed its embassy in Oslo without providing a reason.The Nobel Committee in Oslo awarded her the prize on Friday in recognition of what it called \"her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela\", while Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro referred to the 58-year-old laureate as a \"demonic witch\".The Norwegian foreign ministry called the decision \"regrettable\". \"Despite our differences on several issues, Norway wishes to keep the dialogue open with Venezuela and will continue to work in this direction,\" a ministry spokeswoman said.She added that the Nobel Prize \"is independent of the Norwegian government\".Machado has for years been campaigning against Maduro, whose 12-year rule is viewed by many nations as illegitimate.She has been forced to live in hiding for much of the past year.María Corina Machado wins Nobel Peace PrizeIn honouring her achievement, Nobel chairman Jørgen Watne Frydnes called Machado a \"key, unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided... in a brutal authoritarian state that is now suffering a humanitarian and economic crisis.\"Machado told BBC Mundo her award was \"like an injection\" for her political movement. \"It infuses energy, hope, strength on the Venezuelan people because we realise that we are not alone,\" she said.Caracas also closed its embassy in Australia while opening new outposts in Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso, which it called \"strategic partners in the fight\" against \"hegemonic pressures\".Venezuela's closure of embassies in two close US allies comes after weeks of heightened tension between Caracas and Washington.The US military has destroyed at least four boats that it said were carrying narcotics from Venezuela to the US, killing at least 21 people on board, in what the Trump administration calls a war on drugs. The strikes have attracted condemnation in countries including Venezuela and Colombia, with some international lawyers describing the strikes as a breach of international law.The last time Norway suffered a diplomatic blow over the Nobel Peace Prize was with China in 2010, when it was awarded to political dissident Liu Xiaobo. Beijing suspended trade and other relations, and only normalised ties with Oslo six years later. ",

    "body": "5 hours agoVanessa Buschschlüter andPascal FletcherBBC MonitoringProminent Cuban dissident José Daniel Ferrer has arrived in Miami after being freed from a Cuban prison.Shortly after landing in the United States, the pro-democracy activist called for the release of hundreds of political prisoners held in Cuba. Earlier this month, the 55-year-old revealed that he had taken the \"difficult decision\" to go into exile after being told his wife could also be jailed and their son sent to an institution for juvenile offenders.In a statement, the Cuban foreign ministry said Mr Ferrer and his family had left the country following \"a formal request\" from the US government and insisted that Mr Ferrer had given his \"explicit acceptance\".As co-ordinator of the Patriotic Union of Cuba - an umbrella group of dissident organisations - Mr Ferrer has been one of the most outspoken critics of Cuba's Communist government, which bans political opposition. Like many Cuban dissidents, Mr Ferrer has been in and out of prison.He had been released briefly in January following a deal negotiated by the Vatican under which then US President Joe Biden removed Cuba from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism, just days his term ended.But Mr Ferrer was re-arrested after three months, during which he had continued to speak out against the Cuban government, which accused him of breaching the terms of his parole.The dissident said that following his re-arrest \"the cruelty of the dictatorship towards me has known no bounds\".He has accused prison authorities of humiliating and torturing him.Fellow dissidents have described his departure from Cuba as a \"forced exile\".US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, said in a statement that \"Ferrer's leadership and tireless advocacy for the Cuban people was a threat to the regime, which repeatedly imprisoned and tortured him\".\"We are glad that Ferrer is now free from the regime's oppression,\" Rubio added.He also called on the international community \"to join us in holding the Cuban regime accountable for its abuses\" and to demand the release of \"more of 700 unjustly detained political prisoners\" held on the Communist-run island.

    "body": "4 hours agoBruno BoelpaepIn Brussels andPaul KirbyEurope digital editorReutersDemonstrators held a banner that read \"social health: vital\"Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets in Brussels as part of a national strike over government reforms and spending cuts that has brought flights to a halt and severely disrupted public transport.Belgium's three big unions are protesting over pensions and other measures by Prime Minister Bart de Wever's centre-right government aimed at cutting the budget deficit.There were no services at Belgium's second biggest airport at Charleroi, and all departures and many of the arrivals were cancelled at Brussels Airport.Although trains were running, most buses, trams and underground trains in the capital ground to a halt.Shipping at Europe's second biggest port Antwerp was suspended until Wednesday because of understaffing, and more than 100 ships waited in the North Sea for permission to dock at three ports, according to Belgium's MDK maritime and coastal services.Belgium has been hit by several strikes since Flemish nationalist Bart de Wever came to office last February.By midday, police said 80,0000 protesters had joined the demonstration in the Belgian capital.Bruno Boelpaep/BBCThe unions were expecting more than 100,000 Belgians to join the Brussels protestPublic sector workers were protesting against austerity measures and a government increasingly perceived as leaning right.They wound through the streets of central Brussels, many wearing the red or green colours of the main unions. A key issue for the unions is the government's plan to increase the number of days Belgians work per year before they can receive their pensions, as well as the end of special schemes for several sectors including military and railway workers. De Wever's government has also announced measures including a maximum two-year limit on claiming unemployment benefit. Further cuts are planned for next year's budget, and some proposals such as reducing child benefit or raising VAT have already been floated.\"It's about time we came together,\" said Anaïs, 29. \"It's always the same part of the population that has to tighten their belts.\"Bruno Boelpaep/BBCAnaïs complained that the government's pension reforms would not affect wealthier BelgiansHolding a placard showing the number 67 with a red line through it, she objected to the pension age going up: \"65 is enough. 67 is too late. We are asked to work more, to work longer hours. It's not fair.\"The rise in pension age was adopted 10 years ago, well before De Wever's government came to office, but it remains deeply unpopular and the government is aiming to ringfence it and make it more expensive to retire earlier.Thierry Bodson of the ABVV union told demonstrators that \"the fight against the De Wever government is not just the fight of a day or a year - it's for a whole generation\", Belga news agency reported.\"We need to fight for our rights,\" said mother-of-two Vanessa, who had travelled from Charleroi. \"I'm worried about the measures that will be taken. What sort of future will my children have?\" she told the BBC.It is not just the federal government under pressure to cut spending. Belgium's complex multi-level governance means regional authorities are also imposing austerity measures. The ruling coalition in Belgium's largely French-speaking Walloon region has announced that teachers in the higher tiers of secondary schools will have to work an extra two hours per week. Many of them joined the protests today.\"Nothing is clear, and it's really worrying, but if higher-level teachers have to work more, many jobs will be cut,\" said Sandrine, 48, who works in education.Although the protests were largely peaceful, there were several incidents of vandalism and arson early in the morning and some people in masks clashed with police later on.",

    "body": "13 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesNexperia is based in the Netherlands and operates factories worldwide, including in the UKThe Dutch government has taken control of Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands, in a bid to safeguard the European supply of semiconductors for cars and other electronic goods and protect Europe's economic security.The Hague said it took the decision due to \"serious governance shortcomings\" and to prevent the chips from becoming unavailable in an emergency.Nexperia's owner Wingtech said on Monday that it would take actions to protect its rights and would seek government support.The development threatens to raise tensions between the European Union and China, which have increased in recent months over trade and Beijing's relationship with Russia.In December 2024, the US government placed Wingtech on its so-called \"entity list\", identifying the company as a national security concern. Under the regulations, US companies are barred from exporting American-made goods to businesses on the list unless they have special approval.In the UK, Nexperia was forced to sell its silicon chip plant in Newport, after MPs and ministers expressed national security concerns. It currently owns a UK facility in Stockport.The Dutch Economic Ministry said it made the \"highly exceptional\" decision to invoke the Goods Availability Act over \"acute signals of serious governance shortcomings\" within Nexperia.\"These signals posed a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities,\" the ministry said in a statement.\"Losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security.\"The statement did not detail why it thought the firm's operations were risky. A spokesperson for the minister of economic affairs told the BBC there was no further information to share.The measures are aimed to keep European chip supplies flowing and protect Dutch intellectual property, said EU-China researcher Sacha Courtial.In a crisis, a Chinese-owned company could come under pressure from Beijing to halt supplies or prioritise sales to China, crippling European industries like carmakers and electronics manufacturers, he said.The Hague's move puts economic security \"over free-market investment principles\", in what could pave the way for other governments to follow, said Mr Courtial from the Jacques Delors Institute.The China Semiconductor Industry Association said on Tuesday that it is \"seriously concerned\" about the Dutch government taking control of Nexperia. The group described the measures as \"selective and discriminatory\" against overseas branches of Chinese enterprises and undermine open trade.'Mitigating risk'The Goods Availability Act is designed to allow the Hague to intervene in companies under exceptional circumstances. These include threats to the country's economic security and to ensure the supply of critical goods.Under the order, the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs, Vincent Karremans, could reverse or block Nexperia's decisions if they were potentially harmful to the company's interests, to its future as a business in the Netherlands or Europe, or to ensure supply remains available in an emergency.The Dutch government added the company's production can continue as normal.\"This measure is intended to mitigate that risk,\" the ministry said.Shanghai-listed shares in Nexperia's parent company Wingtech fell by 10% on Monday morning.A Nexperia spokesperson said the company \"complies with all existing laws and regulations, export controls and sanctions regimes,\" and had no further comment.In a statement in Mandarin, Wingtech said its operations were continuing uninterrupted and it remained in close communication with its suppliers and customers.Wingtech said in a stock filing that the company's chairman, Zhang Xuezheng, was suspended from Nexperia's boards by an Amsterdam court order earlier this month.The company was also in talks with lawyers about potential legal remedies, it added.The BBC has also contacted the Chinese embassies in the Netherlands and Brussels.",

Instead, he moved forward and shot PC Ramadhan Matanka in the ribs.The policeman was immediately taken to hospital but died while undergoing treatment, according to a police statement.The attack has raised questions about possible security lapses as State House is one of Kenya's most heavily guarded locations.PC Matanka's body is now in a mortuary and there will be a post-mortem later.An investigation is also under way to establish the motive behind the attack.Local media are reporting that the dead policeman had been among those screening vehicles entering State House.The alleged attacker, who had reportedly disguised himself as a homeless person carrying a sack concealing the weapons, was detained following the assault.Video footage, published by Kenyan television channel NTV later on Monday, showed a handcuffed man with visible injuries. He was in a police vehicle and was reportedly being taken to hospital for treatment.The man is expected to appear in court later on Tuesday, local media are reporting.\"The National Police Service condemns this heinous act and commends the officers for their swift response, which prevented further harm,\" police spokesperson Muchiri Nyaga said.He sent his condolences to the family of the dead policeman, noting that the officer had \"paid the ultimate price in the line of duty\".",

Soon, we would raise our right hands and swear the Oath of Allegiance to the United States in a ceremony that is known as both solemn and celebratory. Carrying small American flags, we would walk out citizens.But then, abruptly, we learned the ceremony had been cancelled because of the government shutdown.\"You should have been notified,\" said the staff member at the desk.None of us had received any emails or phone calls. The staff at the entrance had let us in without warning, raising the possibility that they too had not been notified.Later, when I checked the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website, it was temporarily down.When it came back online, I saw my appointment had been cancelled days earlier \"due to unforeseen circumstances.\" If you hadn't checked the website yourself, you would never have known.\"We regret any inconvenience this may cause,\" the notice said.Around me at the office, disappointment quickly turned into confusion.One woman in a hijab quietly asked if I had been turned away too, worried it might have been because of her clothing. A man had gathered his family to celebrate his final step to becoming a US citizen, only to leave anxious and uncertain.  A few people seemed genuinely frightened, wondering how the delay might affect their work, lives and plans.This was more than an inconvenience.Some of us had spent years plodding through paperwork and interviews, as well as preparing for the citizenship test.  After more than a decade of having a green card, I had decided to become a citizen and vote. All of us now were stuck in limbo.At the office, we were told to come back on 1 November. With the ongoing federal shutdown, though, there's a chance that could slip.The immigration service is largely funded by application fees and so it typically stays open during a government shutdown.But its director, Joseph Edlow, said in a post on X that public-facing services such as interviews and naturalisation ceremonies can be delayed. He added that the agency \"regrets any negative impacts but must ensure it complies with the law\".It's unclear how many USCIS appointments or oath ceremonies have been cancelled nationwide. The service lists field office closures on a web page, but it does not provide totals for cancelled ceremonies.  Anecdotal reports have circulated online about other oath ceremonies that have been scrapped.What's also unclear is when the government will reopen.Republicans and Democrats have been deadlocked over government funding since 1 October, leading to a shutdown that has placed more than 700,000 federal workers on unpaid leave.Add on the many rapid changes made to US immigration policies in the last nine months, and the anxiety among those of us working to become American citizens can only rise. The effects of a Washington stalemate are rippling into the everyday lives - and possibly futures - of those of us hoping to call the US our permanent home.",

    "body": "53 minutes agoLaura Gozzi andPaul KirbyEurope digital editorBloomberg via Getty ImagesSébastien Lecornu announced the planned suspension two days before his new government faced votes of confidenceFrench Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu has told parliament he backs suspending controversial 2023 pension reforms, in the face of crucial votes of no-confidence later this week.The changes, which raised the retirement age from 62 to 64, were seen as signature reforms in Emmanuel Macron's presidency.\"This autumn I will propose to parliament that we suspend the 2023 pension reform until the [2027] presidential election,\" Lecornu said to applause from left-wing parties.Lecornu was reappointed prime minister last week only four days after he resigned, and needs the support of Socialist MPs in parliament if his government is to survive.Opposition parties on the far right and far left have called confidence votes, known as \"censure\" votes on Lecornu's government, for Thursday morning and are demanding parliamentary elections.The Socialists said they would be prepared to support the new government, but only if it promises a complete suspension of Macron's pension changes.\"If he does not explicitly say the words 'immediate and complete suspension of the pension reform', it will be censure,\" Socialist MP Laurent Baumel said earlier on French TV.\"He is holding his destiny in his own hands. He knows what he has do if he doesn't want to be the prime minister who resigns every week.\"The reforms were finally pushed through parliament in March 2023, less than a year after Macron was voted in for a second presidential term.There had been months of political debate, strikes and street protests, and in the end the bill had to go through without a vote in parliament using a constitutional mechanism known as 49:3. Last week, Lecornu said it was something many French people remembered as a \"wound on democracy\" .On Tuesday he made it plain to MPs that suspending the pension reform would cost €400m (£350m) in 2026 and a further €1.8bn (£1.57bn) in 2027. This will have to be \"compensated by other savings,\" Lecornu said.Lecornu is France's third prime minister in the past year but even if he does survive he needs to get a budget through parliament that brings down a budget deficit heading for 5.4% of economic output (GDP) this year. France's public debt earlier this year stood at €3.4tn, or almost 114% of GDP, the third highest in the eurozone after Greece and Italy.Lecornu has been one of Macron's most loyal allies, so his decision to row back on such a contested reform shows how keen the president is to avoid further turmoil.Philippe Aghion, who was jointly awarded the 2025 Nobel economics prize on Monday, said earlier that he also backed a suspension of the pension reform, because it would still come at a smaller cost than the instability that would follow another government collapse.\"We're living through an era of crisis,\" Lecornu told MPs. \"Some people want the situation to turn into a regime crisis, but that won't happen.\"Promising a \"serious and reliable budget\", the prime minister also vowed to bring an end to reliance on the 49:3 mechanism to push through legal changes without a vote. Since late 2022, every budget has had to be forced through without a vote.Repeatedly, he told the chamber that \"the government will propose, we will debate and you will vote\".Parliament will have \"the final word\", he said.To audible groans from MPs, Lecornu proposed a working group to look into pensions, and said it would have to come to a decision by the time of the next presidential election.France's budget deficit is far above the EU target of 3% of GDP, and Lecornu said that reversing the pension reform would have to be \"financially compensated, including through cost-saving measures. It cannot be carried out at the expense of an increased deficit\".Marine Le Pen's hard-right National Rally and the radical-left France Unbowed (LFI) of Jean-Luc Mélenchon have both tabled confidence votes in Lecornu's government on Thursday, but would need the support of centre-left parties to bring him down.Le Pen and Mélenchon believe elections are the only way of ending the political deadlock that came out of snap elections called by Macron in the summer of 2024.That deadlock turned to turmoil last week when Lecornu resigned as prime minister 26 days after Macron had appointed him, and only hours after he had named his government.In a week of political twists and drama, Macron then reappointed him late on Friday.The move was widely seen as a last-ditch attempt by the president to exercise control over an increasingly rudderless National Assembly, which has been splintered into three distinct factions since the 2024 vote.That hung parliament has resulted in two short-lived prime ministers who were voted down within months when they attempted to put forward their yearly budgets.Eight days ago, Lecornu stood down before he could even face MPs.",

Only four were announced,\" Mr Cooper said.Family handoutAmiram Cooper was kidnapped from his home alongside his wife on 7 October 2023He described the news as a \"very big disappointment\" for the families.\"It's clear to us that they could have and should have released more and [that] they're playing games.\"Mr Cooper's parents were both kidnapped in the 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attacks on Israel, from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. His mother was released later that month while his father was killed in captivity.Who are the released hostages?What happens next in Gaza ceasefire plan after hostage release?The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had been operating in the area at the time but did not confirm how he was killed, referring the BBC this week to a previous statement saying the circumstances were \"under examination\". Hamas has claimed he was killed by an Israeli military strike.AFP via Getty ImagesDozens of people were at Re'im military base to see the return of the hostages on MondayThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the relatives of many of the hostages, has called for \"a very serious response\" from the Israeli government and mediators, for what is described as Hamas's \"violation of the agreement\". It said further stages of the peace plan should not progress until all the remaining bodies had been returned.Mr Cooper headed to the Re'im military base in southern Israel on Monday to see the return of the 20 living hostages.In voicenotes sent over the course of the day, he described feeling \"tremendous anticipation\" and a \"big relief\" as he saw them return. But he said the thought of the bodies coming back to Israel was \"heartbreaking\".Family handoutRuby Chen (R) with his son Itay (L), whose body still remains in GazaSpeaking again the following day, after the news that the four bodies returned did not include Amiram's, he described the experience as a \"big rollercoaster\".Mr Cooper said the return of his father's body would allow him to have \"some closure\" and to \"sleep better at night\".\"Everything has been on hold,\" he said.Ruby Chen, whose son Itay's body remains in Gaza, said he had experienced a similar mix of emotions.\"We were overjoyed [on Monday] to see 20 hostages coming out and being reunited with their families, but we were very disappointed not to see more deceased hostages coming out,\" he said in a video message shared with the BBC by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.\"We request the Israeli government, the US and the mediators to continue the fight and put pressure on Hamas to adhere [to] and follow the agreement that was signed and bring back all the remaining 24 hostages in captivity,\" Mr Chen added.The Israeli military said on Tuesday that, following forensic tests, it had identified the four hostages whose bodies had been returned and had informed their families that their loved ones had been reburied. It said they included Guy Iloz - who was shot at the Nova music festival and is believed to have died from the wounds - and Bipin Joshi, who it said was believed to have been \"murdered in captivity during the first months of the war\".",

    "body": "Foul skies, fading light: How air pollution is stealing India's sunshine17 hours agoSoutik BiswasIndia correspondentHindustan Times via Getty ImagesIndia faces a severe air pollution crisis, ranking among the world's top 10 most polluted countriesIndia is losing sunlight.A new study by six Indian scientists finds that over the past three decades, sunshine hours - the time direct sunlight reaches the Earth's surface - have steadily declined across most of India, driven by clouds, aerosols and local weather.Data from 20 weather stations from 1988 to 2018 shows a persistent decline in sunshine hours nationwide, with only the northeast region seeing a mild seasonal reprieve, according to the paper published in Scientific Reports, a peer-reviewed journal published by Nature Portfolio.Scientists from Banaras Hindu University, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and the India Meteorological Department report that the steepest annual declines occurred in the northern inland region - notably Amritsar and Kolkata - as well as along the Himalayan belt and the west coast, particularly Mumbai.All of nine India's geograpically diverse regions showed an overall annual decline in sunshine hours, though the rate of decrease varied across India. Monthly analysis revealed significant increases from October to May, followed by sharp drops from June to July in six of the nine regions.This seasonal pattern of sunshine intersects with a deeper, long-standing problem: India's severe air pollution crisis - it's now among the world's top 10 polluted countries - which scientists trace back to the 1990s. Rapid urbanisation, industrial growth and land-use changes drove up fossil fuel use, vehicle emissions and biomass burning, sending aerosols into the atmosphere and dimming the Sun's rays.  Getty ImagesMumbai's sunshine hours are gradually declining, the scientists foundIn winter, high air pollution from smog, temperature inversions and crop burning across the Indo-Gangetic plains produces light-scattering aerosols, which reduce sunshine hours.These aerosols - tiny solid or liquid particles from dust, vehicle exhaust, crop burning, and other sources - persist in the air long enough to affect sunlight, climate and health.During June-July, monsoon clouds blanket much of India, sharply reducing sunlight even though aerosol levels are lower than in winter.Scientists note that higher sunshine hours from October to May don't indicate cleaner air; rather, they reflect more cloud-free days. Hazy winter sunlight may scatter or diffuse, lowering intensity without entirely blocking sunshine, which instruments still record as sunshine hours.\"Our study found that shrinking sunshine hours are linked to clouds that linger longer without releasing rain, blocking more sunlight. These longer-lasting clouds form indirectly due to aerosols that alter weather and climate,\" says Manoj Kumar Srivastava, a professor of geophysics at the Banaras Hindu University, and one of the authors of the study.Aerosols have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching the ground in India by about 13%, while clouds accounted for an additional 31-44% drop in surface solar radiation between 1993 and 2022, according to Sachchida Nand Tripathi, an atmospheric scientist at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur.These patterns raise concerns for agriculture, daily life and India's solar energy ambitions, while highlighting where solar panels could be most effective.Solar now makes up 47% of India's renewable energy capacity. The government says it's on track for 500GW of renewables by 2030, with more than 100GW of solar installed as of early 2025. But declining sunlight could cast a shadow on the country's solar ambitions.According to Prof Tripathi, air pollution compounds the problem. It reduces solar panel output by 12-41% depending on the type of photovoltaic system - the technology that converts sunlight into electricity - and costs an estimated $245-835m in lost power generation.LightRocket via Getty ImagesIndia's solar ambitions could be dimmed by declining sunlightStudies also show that cleaner air could boost India's annual solar energy production by 6-28 terawatt hours of electricity - enough to power millions of homes for a year.But the impact of pollution doesn't stop at solar energy. It also takes a heavy toll on agriculture, causing an estimated 36–50% loss in crop yields - mainly rice and wheat - in the country's most polluted regions, according to Prof Tripathi.India isn't alone in losing sunshine; across the world, rising air pollution and shifting weather patterns have dimmed the skies.A study published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics observed that Europe likely experienced reduced sunlight reaching the ground because of air pollution between1970–2009. In Germany, sunshine hours decreased by approximately 11% from 1951 to 1980, attributed to industrial gas emissions and associated cloud formation.Research also showed that stricter clean-air laws in the 1990s led to a rebound in sunshine hours across Europe.China also experienced a significant decline in sunshine hours from the 1960s to the 2000s, primarily due to increased aerosol emissions from rapid industrialisation. Sunshine duration varied across Chinese cities, with some areas experiencing more significant declines due to factors such as air pollution.The good news: scientists say the Earth's surface has gradually been receiving more sunlight since the 1980s - a trend known as global brightening, following decades of dimming.New analysis of satellite data from 1984 to 2018 appears to confirm this, showing the effect is strongest over land and in the Northern Hemisphere, driven mainly by falling aerosols in the 1980s and 1990s and shifts in cloud patterns.The bad news: heavily polluted countries like India are missing out. If the Sun keeps hiding behind smog, India risks running on fumes instead of full power.",

    "body": "11 hours agoNatalie ShermanBusiness reporterJanani Mohan/Yagappa PhotographyJanani Mohan is missing a sari she wore at her wedding in April, which was also worn by her motherGraduate student Nicole Lobo moved back to the US in late August after a year in the UK, shipping 10 boxes of possessions back home to Philadelphia that she expected to arrive within a few days. Six weeks later, she is still waiting for the shipment - and fears it is lost, destroyed by UPS as the company struggles to handle a flood of packages facing new customs and tariff rules. \"It's been horrific,\" says the 28-year-old, who was notified last month that her boxes would be disposed of, leaving her to make frantic phone calls and send emails to try to head off the outcome. It's an ordeal facing many UPS customers since the Trump administration in late August stopped allowing parcels worth less than $800 to enter the US without inspection, taxes or tariffs.The decision abruptly made an estimated 4 million packages each day subject to new, more onerous processing and documentation rules.As the influx leads to longer processing times and higher, sometimes unexpected, costs across the industry, some customers of UPS like Nicole, say they fear their packages have been lost in the backlog. \"It's beyond comprehension to me,\" says Janani Mohan, a 29-year-old engineer living in Michigan, who has also spent hours on hold and sent repeated emails since a tracking alert listed a box sent by her parents in India as set for disposal.The parcel held her wedding sari, which had also been worn by her mother, an heirloom sari from her grandmother and wedding photos, among other items. \"I literally cried to them on the phone,\" she says. \"Everything in there is very close to my heart.\"Oregon-based Mizuba Tea Co, which has used UPS for more than a decade to import matcha from Japan, has five shipments together worth more than $100,000 held up in processing.The firm has received conflicting alerts about their status, including some saying the items were set for disposal. \"My whole team is basically on scan watch,\" says Lauren Purvis, who runs the business with her family and is now starting to worry about running out of inventory if the limbo continues. \"It's just clear to us that the current importing systems were not prepared to handle the sheer amount of volume and paperwork.\"Mizuba TeaLauren Purvis says her whole team is on \"scan watch\"Importers typically have 10 days after goods enter the US to submit documentation about the goods, pay tariffs and other fees, allowing the package to go to its recipient. But the Trump administration's rapid changes to tariff rules have made it increasingly difficult to meet customs deadlines requirements, say shipping companies like FedEx and UPS, which offer customs services and often act as importers of record.For example, businesses are now responsible for paying tariffs on any steel or aluminium contained in a product , and in many cases vouching for its country of origin - information that many businesses, let alone their shipping companies, do not know. \"Because of changes to US import regulations, we are seeing many packages that are unable to clear customs due to missing or incomplete information about the shipment required for customs clearance,\" a UPS spokeswoman said. While acknowledging longer shipping times, the company said it was still successfully clearing more than 90% of international packages within a day of arrival. The spokeswoman said its policy was to contact customers three times before moving to dispose of a package. But seven people interviewed by the BBC, including several businesses responsible for shipping the items, said they had received no word from UPS about issues before seeing the tracking alert that their package would be trashed.FedEx, another major player in the industry, said it does not typically destroy packages, unless directed to do so by the shipper. Nicole, the graduate student, says she has been asked to supply more information about her items, which she did promptly in early September.  She did not hear more until seeing the notice about disposal in late September. After the BBC enquired about her package, the tracking information was updated for the first time in weeks to say it was \"on the way\", raising her hopes. Likewise, Janani says the company reached out last week, after the BBC got in touch, for a few more documents and her package now appears to have cleared customs.Swedish Candy LandDaniel and Tobias Johansson, co-founders of Swedish Candy Land, say lost packages have cost their company $50,000But for businesses, the chaos has already had real costs. Swedish candy exporter Swedish Candy Land says more than 700 packages it sent via UPS to customers in the US in the first few weeks of September have been held up.Co-founder Tobias Johansson says the business switched to FedEx after becoming aware of the problem and its shipments were now arriving without incident, although the process took a few days longer than before . But the lost packages, some of which have been reported destroyed, have cost the firm roughly $50,000 in refunds, not including the expenses they incurred in shipping and brokerage fees. \"That was a big hit for us and we haven't gotten any answers yet for anything,\" says Mr Johansson.Experts say the ripple effects are being felt across the supply chain, even on businesses, like Mizuba, that were not bringing in shipments using the $800 exemption from tariffs, known as de minimis.  \"This can be felt pretty much across the board,\" says Bernie Hart, vice president of business development at Flexport, a logistics and customs business. In a call with financial analysts last month, FedEx executives said it had been a \"very stressful period\" for its customers, especially smaller players. \"That is a big headwind,\" chief executive Raj Subramanian said, warning that changes to the trade environment would likely lead to a $1bn hit this year, including $300m in additional expenses as the firm hires and faces other costs related to the new rules. But John Pickel, vice president of supply chain policy for the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents many shipping firms, fears the issues may get worse before they get better. Overall trade volumes last month were lower than is typical, in part because many businesses rushed goods into the US early to beat tariffs. \"There's always been this prevailing thought that companies will figure it out,\" he says. \"What we've seen is that is much harder than anyone anticipated.\"",

    "body": "17 hours agoPriti GuptaTechnology Reporter, MumbaiNextWealthIndia's Virudhunagar is home to ancient templesVirudhunagar, a town in southeastern India, can boast temples that date back thousands of years.But not far from those ancient sites, people are working on the latest tech - artificial intelligence.One of those is Mohan Kumar. \"My role is in AI annotation. I collect data from various sources, label it, and train AI models so they can recognize and predict objects. Over time, the models become semi-supervised and can make decisions on their own,\" he says.India has long been a centre for outsourced IT support, with cities like Bangalore or Chennai being traditional hubs for such work.But in recent years firms have been moving that work into much more remote areas, where costs for staff and space are lower. The trend is know as cloud farming, and AI has given it another boost with numerous towns, like Virudhunagar, hosting firms working on AI.So does Mr Kumar think he is missing out, by not being in a big city?\"Professionally, there is no real difference. Whether in small towns or metros, we work with the same global clients from the US and Europe, and the training and skills required are the same,\" says Mr Kumar.Mohan KumarMohan Kumar prepares data used to train AI modelsMr Kumar works for Desicrew. Founded in 2005 it was a pioneer in cloud farming.\"We realised that instead of forcing people to migrate to cities in search of jobs, we could bring jobs to where people already live,\" says Mannivannan J K, the chief executive of Desicrew .\"For too long, opportunities have been concentrated in cities, leaving rural youth behind. Our mission has always been to create world-class careers closer to home, while proving that quality work can be delivered from anywhere.\"Desicrew does all sorts of outsourced work including software testing for start-up firms, building datasets to train AI, and moderating content. At the moment 30 to 40% of its work is AI related, \"but very soon, it will grow to 75 to 100%,\" says Mr J K.Much of that work is transcription - turning audio to text.\"Machines understand text far better,\" he explains.\"For AI to work naturally, machines must be trained to understand variations in how people speak. That's why transcription is such a crucial step, it forms the foundation for machines to comprehend and respond across languages, dialects, and contexts.\"Doing such work in a smaller town is not a disadvantage, Mr J K says.\"People often assume rural means underdeveloped, but our centres mirror urban IT hubs in every way – secure data access, reliable connectivity, and uninterrupted power. The only difference is geography. \"Around 70% of his workforce are women: \"For many, this is their first salaried job, and the impact on their families is transformative – from financial security to education for their children,\" says Mr J K.NextWealthAround 60% of NextWealth staff are womenFounded in 2008, NextWealth was also an early mover in cloud farming.Headquartered in Bangalore, it employs 5,000 staff in 11 offices in smaller towns across India.\"Sixty percent of India's graduates come from small towns, but most IT companies hire only from the metros. That leaves behind a huge untapped pool of smart, first-generation graduates,\" says Mythily Ramesh, co-founder and managing director of NextWealth.\"Many of these students are first-generation graduates. Their parents are farmers, weavers, tailors, policemen - families who take loans to fund their education,\" she says.NextWealth started with outsourced work from the back offices of big companies, but five years ago moved into artificial intelligence.\"The world's most advanced algorithms are being trained and validated in India's small towns,\" says Ms Ramesh.Around 70% of its work comes from the US. \"Every AI model, from a ChatGPT-like system to facial recognition, needs vast amounts of human-labelled data. That is the backbone of cloud-farming jobs.\"She thinks there is plenty more work to come.\"In the next 3–5 years, AI and GenAI will create close to 100 million jobs in training, validation, and real-time handling. India's small towns can be the backbone of this workforce.\"She is hopeful that India can remain a hub for such work.\"Countries like the Philippines may catch up, but India's scale and early start in AI sourcing gives us a five to seven-year advantage. We must leverage it before the gap narrows,\" she says.KS Viswanathan is a technology advisor, and formerly worked at India's National Association of Software and Service Companies, the trade association for outsourcing firms. \"Silicon Valley may be building the AI engines, but the day-to-day work that keeps those engines reliable increasingly comes from India's cloud farming industry,\" he says.\"We are truly at a tipping point. If cloud farming continues to scale, small-town India could well become the world's largest hub for AI operations, just as it became the hub for IT services two decades ago.\"But success is not guaranteed. While Next Wealth and Desicrew both say they have access to reliable and secure internet connections, Mr Viswanathan says that is not always the case in India's smaller towns.\"Reliable high-speed internet and secure data centres are not always at par with metros, which makes data protection a constant concern.\"Even if good connections are in place, work needs to be done to reassure clients.\"The bigger challenge is the perception rather than a technical one. International clients often assume small towns cannot meet data security standards, even when the systems are robust. Trust has to be earned through delivery.\"Back at NextWealth, Dhanalakshmi Vijay \"fine-tunes\" AI. For example, if it confuses two similar looking items, like a blue denim jacket and a navy shirt, she will correct the model.  \"These corrections are then fed back into the system, fine-tuning the model so that the next time it sees a similar case, it performs better. Over time, the AI model builds up experience, just like updating software with regular patches to make it more accurate and reliable,\" says Ms Vijay.Such work has an effect in the real world. \"It's me and team who indirectly train the AI models to make your online shopping experience easy and hassle free,\" she says.More Technology of Business",

    "body": "2 days agoAna Faguyin Martinsburg, West VirginiaBBCTroy Williams, Marcellus Brothers and Jonathan GibaIt's been three months since Jonathan Giba moved into temporary housing for homeless veterans inside a hospital for former members of the US military in West Virginia.He has been waiting for medical and dental consultations, after medications he was previously prescribed left him without teeth and unable to walk. Now, with the government shut down, he is preparing to wait even longer.He calls it \"political bs\". The US Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital where Mr Giba is staying in Martinsburg, West Virginia, is still providing medical care, but the VA stopped other programs that help veterans find jobs and transition from military life.\"The shutdown is a waste of time, and it hurts everyone in the meantime,\" the Army veteran says.Martinsburg is an American town particularly fixed to feel the impacts of the US government shutdown. A city of nearly 20,000 people some 85 miles (136km) outside of Washington DC, federal agencies employ upwards of 3,300 people in the area, between the veterans' hospital, an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) processing facility and an agricultural assistance office. Another thousand or so federal workers commute to the nation's capital each day from the Amtrak station in Martinsburg's centre.This is Trump country, where 67% voted for the president in 2024 and a fierce independence undergirds something of a make-it-work mindset.  Because of the government shutdown, a nearby community event - the Freedom's Run Race Series - changed its route from trails near a federal Civil War battlefield site, but otherwise went on as planned. Harper's Ferry, a national park and nearby tourist draw, has been kept open with state money.But the political bickering in Washington and perceived lack of concern about everyday Americans are not far from people's minds. And they worry about what's coming as the shutdown drags on.On an unseasonably warm Monday nearly six days after the US government shut down, Mr Giba sits underneath the shade of a large tree chain-smoking cigarettes with fellow veterans. One of them, Troy Williams, says politics is hurting average Americans. \"This isn't a Democrat or Republican issue,\" he says, \"this is a why aren't they working on a solution issue.\"Air Force veteran Marcellus Brothers is concerned about what's ahead. \"We're in limbo, it's scary.\"What makes this US shutdown different (and more difficult)'No good outcome' - voters across US share concerns about shutdownTrump administration starts laying off thousands of workersRepublicans and Democrats have been deadlocked over government funding since it ran out on 1 October, and much of the government shut down, placing more than 700,000 people on unpaid leave. Some 200,000 other workers deemed \"essential\" are working without pay as the political standoff drags on.Politicians in Washington have pointed fingers in the direction of the opposing party. On Friday, the White House began laying off thousands of federal employees.In a state already hit by job cuts from the Trump administration's efforts to scale back the federal workforce, the shutdown threatens even steeper losses, Kelly Allen, the executive director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy warns.\"We have more federal government employees than coal miners in West Virginia,\" she says. \"Of course those jobs are well paying, come with good benefits and in a state with not a whole lot of good paying jobs those are really important.\"Tina Hissam, a small business employee in the area, has seen the impact of government shutdowns on her neighbours first hand. \"It hurts the small businesses, they may cancel services, they may not shop locally,\" she says of federal workers. \"The government shutdown has a huge impact and it's really scary, I just pray that it all goes away.\" Already, a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) service centre - which serves the seven surrounding counties - has shut its door. The office - responsible for assisting farmers, ranchers and landowners with tasks like applying for farm loans and disaster assistance - will remain closed until the government reopens. And on Wednesday, the IRS furloughed 34,000 workers, so the service centre in Martinsburg may soon be affected. History has shown that as shutdowns go on, more services are cut or shuttered because of a lack of funding.West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito has so far remained unbowed despite the potential impact on areas she represents like Martinsburg. She has voted with fellow Republicans to provide government funding without healthcare subsidies that Democrats want. Both sides' proposals have repeatedly failed.In a local op-ed, Moore Capito noted West Virginia has the third-highest number of federal employees per capita in the country, but blamed Democrats' intransigence.\"These are our neighbours and friends - people who keep our miners safe, process veterans' benefits, secure our borders, and keep drugs out of our communities. They're now facing uncertainty about their pay cheques through no fault of their own.\"When the first cheques since the shutdown arrive - or don't - on Friday that impact may finally hit.In previous shutdowns, federal workers who went without pay were given back pay, but it remains unclear if that will be the case this time around.\"The economic loss could have wide-ranging consequences on local communities, businesses and households. It could cause long-term damage to local economies,\" resident Mark Mulligan says.\"West Virginia is a poor state and dependent on federal jobs and handouts. The pain to the elderly, the disabled and to children could be catastrophic. \"",

    "body": "8 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterGetty ImagesA firm considered one of the leading global voices in encryption has cancelled the announcement of its leadership election results after an official lost the encrypted key needed to unlock them. The International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) uses an electronic voting system which needs three members, each with part of an encrypted key, to access the results. In a statement, the scientific organisation said one of the trustees had lost their key in \"an honest but unfortunate human mistake\", making it impossible for them to decrypt - and uncover - the final results.The IACR said it would rerun the election, adding \"new safeguards\" to stop similar mistakes happening again.The IACR is a global non-profit organisation which was founded in 1982 with the aim to \"further research\" in cryptology, the science of secure communication.It opened votes for three Director and four Officer positions on 17 October, with the process closing on 16 November.The Association used an open source electronic voting system called Helios for the process. The browser-based system uses cryptography to encrypt votes, or keep them secret.Three members of the association were chosen as independent trustees to each be given a third of the encrypted material, which when shared together would give the verdict.Whilst two of the trustees uploaded their share of the encrypted material online, a third never did.'Irretrievably' lostThe IACR said in a statement that the lack of results was due to one of the trustees \"irretrievably\" losing their private key, leaving it \"technically impossible\" for the firm to know the final verdict. It said it was therefore left with no choice but to cancel the election.The association added it was \"deeply sorry\" for the mistake, which it took \"very seriously\". American cryptographer Bruce Schneier told the BBC that failures in cryptographic systems often lie in the fact that \"to provide any actual security\" they have to be \"operated by humans\".\"Whether it's forgetting keys, improperly sharing keys, or making some other mistake,\" he said, \"cryptographic systems often fail for very human reasons\".Voting for the IACR positions has been renewed and will run until 20 December. The association said that it had replaced the initial trustee who lost the encrypted information and will now adopt a \"2-out-of-3\" threshold mechanism for the management of private keys, with a clear written procedure for trustees to follow.",

    "body": "A woman thought to be dead, who was about to be cremated at a Buddhist temple in the outskirts of Bangkok, Thailand, has been found alive by staff.Pairat Soodthoop, general manager of the Wat Rat Prakhong Tham temple, was \"startled\" to hear a faint knock from the coffin, he told the Associated Press news agency. Mr Soodthoop said he asked for the coffin to be opened and saw the woman \"opening her eyes slightly and knocking on the side of the coffin\". \"She must have been knocking for quite some time,\" he added. The brother of the 65-year-old woman said local officials told him his sister had died. However, the temple's manager said the brother did not have a death certificate.As Mr Soodthoop tried to explain to the brother how to obtain a death certificate, the temple's staff heard a faint knock coming from inside the coffin.Once it became clear the woman was alive, the temple's abbot (head of a Buddhist monastery) said the woman should be taken to hospital immediately. A doctor later confirmed that the woman had been experiencing severe hypoglycaemia - a condition where blood sugar levels get critically low, local reports said.The doctor ruled out the possibility that she had suffered respiratory failure or cardiac arrest, according to the reports.The brother said his sibling had been bedridden for the last two years and, as her health deteriorated, she appeared to have stopped breathing on Saturday, according to the temple's manager.The family had travelled nearly 500km (311 mile) from the province of Phitsanulok in Thailand for the cremation ceremony.

    "body": "Israel has received, via the Red Cross, a coffin that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) say contains the body of one of the last three deceased hostages still in Gaza, according to the Israeli prime minister's office.Israeli forces will now transfer the body to Israel's National Centre of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv for identification.Earlier, PIJ and Hamas announced that the body of an Israeli hostage had been found in central Gaza on Monday.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office warned that it viewed \"with severity the delay in the immediate transfer\" of the body, saying it constituted a \"further violation\" of the six-week-old Gaza ceasefire agreement.Following the handover in central Gaza on Tuesday afternoon, the office announced that the families of the three dead hostages had been updated accordingly.\"Our hearts are with them in this difficult hour,\" it added. \"The effort to return our hostages is ongoing and will not cease until the last hostage is returned.\"Under the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.So far, the remains of 22 dead Israeli hostages have been handed over, along with those of three foreign hostages – one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.In exchange, Israel has handed over the bodies of 330 Palestinians killed during the war.Two of the three remaining dead hostages are Israelis - Ran Gvili, 24, and Dror Or, 48 - and one is Thai - Suthisak Rintalak, 43.Israel has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the bodies, while Hamas has insisted it is struggling to find them under rubble.The slow progress has meant there has been no advance on the second phase of President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan. This includes plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction.The dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 69,770 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "6 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorPoland has been told to recognise same-sex marriages registered elsewhere in the European Union, in a ruling by the EU's top court.The European Court of Justice (ECJ) said that EU member states were obliged to recognise a same-sex marriage between two EU citizens that had been \"lawfully concluded in another member state\".The ruling covers the case of a Polish couple who married in Berlin in 2018. When they decided to move to Poland, authorities refused to accept their marriage certificate as Polish law does not recognise same-sex marriage.The ECJ made clear that Polish domestic law would not have to be changed to recognise marriages between people of the same sex.Since the Netherlands recognised same-sex unions in 2001, a number of other EU countries have followed suit, but others, such as Poland, Hungary and Slovakia, have not.In September, Slovakia's populist-nationalist government changed its constitution to allow only heterosexual couples to adopt children.In its ruling on Tuesday, the ECJ said that while marriage rules fell within each member state's competence, \"countries were required to comply with EU law in exercising that competence\".As EU citizens, the Polish couple who married in Germany had the right to freedom of movement and the right to lead a family life, the court explained. \"In particular by virtue of marriage, they must have the certainty to be able to pursue that family life upon returning to their member state of origin,\" it added, so forcing them to live as an unmarried couple in Poland was contrary to EU law and infringed their rights.Poland's pro-European coalition government has tried to advance the rights of same-sex couples, but its move could be vetoed by conservative President Karol Nawrocki.The ECJ's ruling was welcomed by Katarzyna Kotula, a secretary of state and coalition ally of Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who said it was an important step on the path to marriage equality.Meanwhile, centre-left member of the European Parliament Krzysztof Smiszek wrote on social media that \"history is happening\".",

    "body": "14 hours agoJake KwonandLeehyun Choi,SeoulLee Soon-jae, one of South Korea's most beloved actors, died on Tuesday at the age of 91, his agency announced.In a career spanning more than 70 years across films, television and the stage, Lee was fondly known as the \"national TV dad\" for his many roles as a wise, older man. This included two of his best-known performances - as a strict father in the 1991 soap What on Earth is Love, and a silly but lovable grandpa in the popular sitcom High Kick! which aired from 2006 to 2012.News of his death has sparked an outpouring of tributes from young celebrities, including K-pop singers, speaking of his warmth and kindness, to President Lee Jae Myung.\"From theatre to film and television, he brought us laughter, emotion, comfort and courage,\" the president wrote on Facebook.Lee was acting until last year, when he won the grand prize at the KBS Drama Awards for his lead role in the comedy series, Dog Knows Everything. He was the oldest South Korean actor to ever win the honour. \"You become old when you sit down and expect to be waited on,\" he told fellow senior actors on the travel show Grandpas over Flowers. The 2013 show, which revolves around senior stars making strenuous journeys abroad, became a cultural phenomenon.Born in 1934 in Hoeryeong, a county now in North Korea, Lee was just four years old when his family moved south to Seoul.He was working in his grandparents' shop in the capital's Namdaemun market when Korea was liberated from Japanese rule in 1945.Lee studied philosophy at the prestigious Seoul National University but ventured into theatre and, eventually, TV and films. He said he was inspired to act after watching Sir Laurence Olivier play the title role in Hamlet.Lee appeared in some 140 TV shows through his career and continued to act on stage until October 2024, when he withdrew halfway through the run of the play Waiting for Godot because of an illness. He reappeared in public at the awards in December. He also had a brief foray into politics. In 1992, he was elected as a member of parliament for the conservative Democratic Liberal Party, but at the end of his four-year-term he did not run again. Lee's prolific career meant he has remained a household name for a decades, just as familiar to younger audiences and at a time when Korean entertainment is one of the country's biggest exports.His celebrity has even spilled onto the internet where scenes of him from High Kick! have resurfaced as memes on TikTok in recent years.Actor Yoo Yeon-seok, who studied under Lee, said he \"exemplified acting\"  and Lee Soon-jae's High Kick! co-star Jeong Bo-seok described Lee not just as a mentor in the industry, but a \"true mentor in my life\". He wrote on Instagram: \"Teacher, thank you so much for everything. I learned and felt so much from you - not only about acting, but also about life and the attitude of an actor.\" Additional reporting by Rachel Lee",

    "body": "Venezuela has told international airlines to resume flights to the country within 48 hours or risk being stripped of their clearance to fly there altogether.Several airlines suspended their flights to Venezuela after the US aviation regulator warned on Friday of \"heightened military activity\" in the area.The warning came as the US ramped up pressure on the Venezuelan government, sending the world's largest aircraft carrier to the southern Caribbean as part of a larger military build-up. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) has warned Venezuela's aviation authority that rescinding airlines' clearance would only isolate the country further. Venezuela's aviation authority (Inac), which reports to the country's ministry of transport, issued the ultimatum on Monday. Among the airlines affected are Spain's Iberia, Air Europa and Plus Ultra, Brazil's Gol, Chile's Latam, Colombia's Avianca, Portugal's TAP and Turkish Airlines. All of them - except Trinidad and Tobago's Caribbean Airlines, which had already stopped flights in September - halted their flights to Venezuela after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a \"Notice to Air Missions\" on Friday.In it, the FAA advised flight operators \"to exercise caution when operating in the Maiquetía flight information region at all altitudes due to the worsening security situation and heightened military activity in and around Venezuela\".Maiquetía is the location of Venezuela's main international airport, serving the capital, Caracas. While a number of airlines, including Panama's Copa and Venezuela's state-owned Conviasa, have continued to fly in and out of Maiquetía, the suspensions have severely curtailed the number of international flights.Aviation industry body Iata urged Inac to drop the deadline, to avoid further reducing \"connectivity to the country, which is already one of the least connected in the region\".Iata stressed in a statement that its member airlines had suspended their flights temporarily and remained \"committed to restoring operations to and from Venezuela as soon as conditions allow\".Tension between the US and Venezuela has been growing since the former escalated its military presence in the southern Caribbean, in an operation it says is designed to combat drug trafficking.The US Navy has carried out at least 21 strikes against boats allegedly carrying drugs - mostly in the Caribbean but also a few in the Pacific - since the beginning of September. The Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, has denounced the strikes and the military build-up, accusing the US of trying to overthrow him.On Monday, he struck a defiant note telling viewers of his TV show that \"they [the US] will not be able to defeat Venezuela, we are invincible\".The US government has labelled Maduro as an illegitimate leader, pointing to his 2024 re-election, which was widely dismissed as rigged.However, US President Donald Trump has not ruled out speaking directly to Maduro, telling reporters last week that \"at a certain period of time, I'll be talking to him\".",

    "body": "7 hours agoBethany BellViennaMATTHIAS RIETSCHEL/POOL/AFPOne of the seven suspects, Johann G (R), is accused of being one of the group's ringleadersSeven people have gone on trial in Dresden, eastern Germany, charged with being members or supporters of a militant, criminal left-wing extremist group, Antifa Ost - also known as the \"hammer gang\".Earlier this month the United States designated Antifa Ost as a terrorist organisation, along with several other far-left European groups.German prosecutors say the group, founded in late 2017 or early 2018, carried out violent attacks on people they considered to be part of the right-wing scene. The attacks took place in Germany and in the Hungarian capital Budapest.The six men and one woman who are on trial face charges of attempted murder, aggravated assault, and property damage.They have been named only as Henry A, Tobias E, Johann G, Thomas J, Melissa K, Paul M and Julian W, in line with German privacy laws.According to prosecutors, the attacks, which went on for several years, were prepared for \"intensively\" and included, for example, spying on the targets in advance. In several cases victims were severely injured with blows from a hammer and batons.One of the seven defendants, Johann G, is charged with having a prominent role in the group. He is accused of having planned the attacks and recruited members. Prosecutors say that another defendant, Paul M, organised combat training for the group.In one attack, in January 2019, Johann G, Tobias E and others are alleged to have attacked four people at Germany's Dessau-Rosslau train station who were on their way back from a rally in Magdeburg, marking the anniversary of the World War Two bombing of the city.The defendants are accused of striking the victims on the head with heavy tools, including a hammer and an iron bar. Prosecutors say they continued to inflict life-threatening blows and kicks, even after their victims had been knocked to the ground.Johann G and Paul M are also accused of having taken part in attacks in Budapest in February 2023.At that time, right-wing extremists from all over Europe had gathered in Budapest for a so-called \"Day of Honour\" to commemorate the attempted breakout of the German Wehrmacht, the Waffen-SS, and their Hungarian collaborators from the city besieged by the Red Army.Johann G and Paul M are charged with taking part in several attacks, hitting and beating right-wing activists with batons, pepper spray and a hammer. One of the victims received at least 15 blows, mainly to the head.Antifa Ost was designated as a terrorist group in the US earlier this month, as part of President Donald Trump's crackdown on extreme-left activists.The designation makes group members ineligible to enter the US, freezes any assets they may have in the world's largest economy and makes it a crime to provide material support to them.The move was welcomed by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.Stephan Brandner from the AfD said the German government should follow suit.\"Antifa is a terrorist organisation, and it would be easy for the German state to take action against it. It's just that those in power don't want to,\" he said.\"The US government is showing the way forward; something that is long overdue in Germany. All forms of extremism must be combated, and all terrorist organisations must be fought and banned.\"The German foreign ministry said it had taken note of the US decision.",

    "body": "18 hours agoNardine Saadin Los Angeles Records about the death of Celeste Rivas Hernandez, a 15-year-old girl whose body was found in singer D4vd's car, have been barred from public release, officials said. The Los Angeles County medical examiner's office said it received a court order imposing a security hold on the case, and that no details about Ms Rivas Hernandez's death can be released or posted on its website.The police department said it requested the order to ensure officers \"receive information from the Medical Examiner before the public\".Chief Medical Examiner Dr Odey Ukpo said the practice of security holds is \"virtually unheard of in other counties\" and \"has not been proven to improve outcomes in the legal system\". \"We are dedicated to serving our community with full transparency; however, the law precludes us from doing so while the court order remains in this case,\" Dr Ukpo added.Police discovered Rivas Hernandez's remains inside the boot of the impounded Tesla on 8 September, after responding to reports of a foul odour at a Hollywood tow yard. Rivas Hernandez, from Lake Elsinore in California, had been missing and was last seen in April 2024, according to a missing person flyer cited by CBS, the BBC's US news partner.The car, registered to D4vd, had been towed from the Hollywood Hills neighbourhood five days after it had been abandoned. D4vd, 20, whose real name is David Anthony Burke, released his debut album in April and was on tour when the remains were discovered. He has not commented on the case, but his representatives previously said he was cooperating with police.A police spokesperson said the case was being investigated by its robbery-homicide division. No arrests have been made. The county's medical examiner previously said Ms Rivas Hernandez's body was \"severely decomposed\" when it was found in September and deferred making a ruling on how she died pending the death investigation.When her remains were found in a bag in D4vd's car on 8 September, the medical examiner said that she was wearing a tube top, size small black leggings and jewellery, including a yellow metal stud earring and a yellow metal chain bracelet.She also had a tattoo that read \"Shhh…\" on her index finger - a marking nearly identical to that on the pop singer's own index finger.The decomposition of her body indicated that she had already been \"deceased for several weeks\", investigators said.The girl, who lived about 75 miles away from where her body was discovered - had run away from her home repeatedly.Neighbours recognised the first-generation daughter of immigrant parents from El Salvador, as a girl who would visit the corner store almost daily to buy candy and soda, according to the Los Angeles Times.Her family, who described her as a beloved daughter, sister, cousin and friend, said they were \"heartbroken and devastated by this tragic loss\". They solicited money on a crowdfunding website to pay for her funeral, which took place in October.The case has also derailed the aspiring career of the viral hitmaker.His world tour was cancelled within days of the discovery, and Sony Music Publishing reportedly suspended promotion of his second album.Los Angeles police soon raided the posh Hollywood Hills mansion where the singer was living, just blocks from where his Tesla had been towed.US retailer Hollister and footwear giant Crocs dropped D4vd from marketing campaigns and Telepatía singer Kali Uchis announced she was taking down their collaboration, Crashing.",

    "body": "3 hours agoSebastian UsherGlobal affairs reporterBBCZeynab Javadli divorced Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum in 2019The former wife of a member of Dubai's ruling family has expressed concern that she could be arrested as her ex-husband has lodged a criminal complaint with local police, accusing her of kidnapping their three young daughters.Since their divorce in 2019, Zeynab Javadli has been involved in a bitter custody battle with her ex-husband Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who is the nephew of the ruler of Dubai.It has come to a head in recent weeks as the children have changed hands between the parents several times, with each accusing the other of kidnapping them.Ms Javadli also potentially faces arrest for e-crimes - online offences - after she livestreamed the latest showdown.In going public, she says she realised that she was taking a big risk.\"I knew that it was the last chance to be with my children as they would never let me see them again.  I genuinely believed that it was my last chance, so I just opened a livestream and called for help,\" she said in a video message to her British lawyer, David Haigh.Ms Javadli was speaking from her house in Dubai, where she claims that she and her three daughters have essentially once again been isolated since she took them back with her after they'd been with their father for several weeks. Up until then, Ms Javadli had had effective custody of the children under a deal she says was agreed with the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, in 2022. That agreement, she says, guaranteed her custody of the children until they were 18 years old, as well as a house and other assistance. Their schooling has been paid for by their father.In return, David Haigh says she had to sign papers saying that she would - among other things - not speak to the media again about her situation, nor would she do any more livestreaming.A subsequent court ruling granted custody to Sheikh Saeed, but Ms Javadli says she received assurances from those involved in her case that the deal with Dubai's ruler would not be affected.That remained the situation until two months ago.That was when - during one of the regular visitations of the children with Sheikh Saeed - that Ms Javadli says she received a message from him through Dubai police telling her there was no need to wait as they would not be returned to her that day.She heard nothing from them for several weeks. She was finally granted a visitation for three hours at a child protection centre and headed there with her driver on 8 November. She says that when she entered the centre, her children were not there. As she was coming out of the building, she saw them. She says they rushed towards her.She says they were shouting \"Mama, take us from here!\" She told her driver to lock the doors and drive them home.But she claims their way was blocked by cars belonging to people working for her ex-husband. That was when she decided to open a livestream and plead for help. In doing so, she knew that she risked breaking the deal she had signed with the authorities in the UAE and that she could face arrest for doing so, but she insists that it was her only recourse.She has been at home with her children since then and says she does not dare to go out for fear of arrest. The three girls - aged nine, seven and six - have not been going to school.The BBC has contacted a number of officials in the UAE, who are involved in the case, for comment, but has received no reply so far. However, the perspective of Sheikh Saeed is clear from court depositions.The most recent gives a very different version of what happened on 8 November, accusing Ms Javadli of forcibly placing the children into her car with the help of her driver and then kidnapping them. It also accuses Ms Javadli of posting videos on social media in which \"she insulted and slandered\" her former husband as well as defaming the state and violating state laws.Previously, lawyers acting for Sheikh Saeed had claimed in court that Ms Javadli was an unfit mother, who had failed to send her daughters to school, was living in a place unsuitable for the children when she was in a hotel, and that she had put the health of the youngest girl at risk.Ms Javadli rejected the accusations and her Emirati legal team submitted evidence to the contrary in court.David Haigh says that there've been other similar cases involving former wives of members of Dubai's royal family or other female members of the family. He himself has been involved in campaigning for several of the women. None of these cases involve Sheikh Saaed.Princess Haya - the ex-wife of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum - fled the UAE in 2019, saying that she feared for her life. Three years later, the princess won a custody battle that played out in the highest court in the UK, which gave her sole custody of their two children.The most sensational saga was that of one of the daughters of Dubai's ruler, Princess Latifa, who mounted a bid for freedom in 2018 from what at the time she claimed was her family's coercive control.The boat on which she was making her escape was intercepted in the Indian Ocean and she was forcibly returned to Dubai. She then claimed that she was being held captive in secret videos. She has since re-emerged to a limited extent in public, saying she that she was well and living as she wished.Ms Javadli and David Haigh say that Dubai portrays itself as promoting women's rights and encouraging women - whether from the UAE or from outside - to lead fulfilling lives, both professionally and personally. For many, this is no doubt the case.But they claim that Ms Javadli's case shows that beneath the glittering surface of Dubai, for some women the situation can be more complicated and more uncomfortable.",

    "body": "19 hours agoBrandon DrenonGetty ImagesMarjorie Taylor Greene's five years in Congress will come to an early end on 5 January after she unexpectedly announced her resignation following a bitter rift with President Donald Trump.The surprise move from the Georgia congresswoman - a rising star in the Republican party - has left many speculating about her next steps.Her decision follows a public fallout with Trump, who branded her \"a traitor\" and said he would endorse her opponent in next year's election. It comes after months of Greene's blistering criticism on the Trump administration's refusal to release files related to the investigation into the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein - as well as several of Trump's policy positions.Rumours have already begun circulating that Greene, 51, might run for president in 2028, which she immediately shot down. So, if not the Oval Office, what is next for Greene? Run for president in 2028Although she claims she has no interest in the presidency now, having a future change of heart is not an unknown feature of US politics.When Greene signed a petition to force a vote requiring the release of the files related to Epstein - over Trump's objections - it went on to a bill authored by her Democratic colleague, Ro Khanna. Khanna told NBC News after Greene's latest announcement that she was \"likely to be a formidable 2028 candidate\", adding that she was \"more in touch\" with Trump's base than his number two, Vice-President JD Vance. Time Magazine also reported that Greene \"privately told allies\" she was considering a presidential bid, but Greene quickly dismissed the assertion as a \"complete lie\".\"I'm not running for President and never said I wanted to and have only laughed about it when anyone would mention it,\" Greene wrote on social media, re-posting Time Magazine's article. Greene has notably distanced herself from her party's positions - and from the president - for whom she once was an ardent supporter. She has spoken out against issues including Epstein files, Trump's global tariffs, support for Israel and healthcare funding. A possible run for governor or Senate Greene has not been quite as explicit about ruling out the possibility of running for Georgia governor or to represent her state in the US Senate.Elections for both take place in 2026.Two-time Republican Georgia Governor Brian Kemp is up against his term limit and unable to run again, widening the field of possible replacements. Greene could also use her clout to pursue the race for the US Senate and attempt to unseat Democrat Jon Ossoff, who is up for re-election next year.Both the role of governor and US senator are ones that Greene has expressed interest in, at least according to Trump.In the president's public spat with Greene following her resignation announcement, Trump wrote on social media that the feud began \"when I sent her a Poll stating that she should not run for Senator, or Governor\".\"She was at 12%, and didn't have a chance (unless, of course, she had my Endorsement — which she wasn't about to get!)\", he said.Kennesaw State University Professor of Political Science Kerwin Swint, who lives in Greene's congressional district, says that Trump is aware of her unpopularity outside of her immediate district, and that she would probably \"get obliterated\" if she ran for statewide office.Without those options, the only other office she may have her sights on is president, despite her protestations.\"I don't see that happening,\" Swint says. \"She would be such an amazing longshot to dark horse. \"But most politicians have a big enough ego that they look in the mirror, they see a future president. So it's not out of the question.\"Entering the conservative media landscape Swint predicts that she'll start a podcast and attempt to remain in the public spotlight by continuing to build her media profile.\"I think she wants to be an influencer basically. And so I think someone who wants to do that is going to reach for these media opportunities,\" he says.If she chooses a life outside of politics, Greene would join a host of former politicians and political operatives who have launched careers in the podcast arena. After Republican Representative Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress to accept his failed nomination to become Trump's US attorney general, he started his own podcast. The trend has even caught hold on the left, with Democrats like California Governor Gavin Newsom also hosting his own podcast. Meanwhile, FBI deputy director Dan Bongino went on to join the Trump administration after success as a radio host and commentator.Greene could also decide to become a conservative commentator on more left-leaning networks, like CNN, where she has made frequent appearances in recent days. \"I knew she was going to be the next co-host of The View!\", conservative personality Megan McCain wrote on X, referring to Greene's recent appearance on ABC's liberal-leaning daily chat show.Leave politics behind completelyIn the 10-minute video announcing her resignation, Greene also suggested she might leave politics to spend more time with her family who she said she missed \"precious time with\" as she fought for Trump. Throughout her time in politics, Greene said, she faced \"never ending personal attacks\" and \"threats\". \"It has been unfair and wrong, not only to me, but especially to my family,\" she said.  Since her public feud with the president, Greene said the threats against her have only increased.In addition to being a member of Congress, Greene is also the owner of a commercial construction and renovation company called Taylor Commercial. The company has managed roughly $250m in construction projects, since Greene acquired it in 2002, according to her website. With reporting by Max Matza",

    "body": "President Donald Trump's senior Africa envoy, Massad Boulos, has rejected criticism that the US's latest proposal to end the Sudan civil war is \"biased\".The US, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have been attempting to mediate between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which have been fighting for more than two years.On Sunday, Sudan's army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan said the latest ceasefire proposal was unacceptable and future ones would also be one-sided as long as the UAE was involved in the negotiations.The Gulf state denies it is offering support to the RSF and on Tuesday Mr Boulos said the bias Burhan spoke of was non-existent.\"He was making reference to something that does not exist, that has never been presented by us. So we have no idea what he is talking about,\" the AFP news agency reports Mr Boulos as saying while at a media briefing with UAE presidential adviser Anwar Gargash.In a video address on Sunday, Burhan said the latest peace plan proposal was \"the worst ever\" because it sidelines the army and \"allows the Rapid Support Forces to remain\".He accused Trump's adviser of attempting to impose conditions.\"We are not advocates of war, nor do we reject peace, but no-one can threaten us or impose conditions on us,\" he said.\"We fear that Massad Boulos may become an obstacle to the peace sought by all Sudanese.\"The US, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and UAE - collectively known as \"the Quad\" - proposed a three-month humanitarian truce to the two sides in September. They said the agreement should be followed by a permanent ceasefire and a transition to civilian rule.The army at the time rejected \"foreign interference\" - which observers say is a reference to the UAE - and any attempts that equated it with a \"racist terrorist militia that relies on foreign mercenaries\".The Sudanese army has repeatedly alleged that the UAE has been supplying the RSF with weapons and foreign fighters.UN experts say accusations of such military support are credible, but the Gulf nation has denied all involvement with the RSF.On Monday, the RSF announced a unilateral three-month ceasefire \"in response to international efforts, chiefly that of His Excellency US President Donald Trump\", to end the war.However, the army said on Tuesday that the RSF had attacked the town of Babanusa, the army's last stronghold in West Kordofan state. Earlier in November, Sudan's capital, Khartoum - which is held by the army - was hit by a drone attack the day after the RSF agreed to an earlier humanitarian ceasefire.The RSF's ceasefire declaration \"seems to be largely a political ploy\", Sudanese analyst Kholood Khair told the BBC's Newsday programme.\"The army has been so intransigent about the prospect of a truce and effectively it's a way of getting a political win in the eyes of the Quad, in particular the United States,\" Ms Khair the founder of Confluence Advisory think-tank said.Last week, Trump said he would intervene to help end the war, which has forced 12 million people from their homes and caused what the UN has called the world's worst humanitarian crisis.There has been no systematic recording of the number of people killed but in May 2024, then US special envoy for Sudan Tom Perriello pointed to estimates of up to 150,000.In recent weeks, reports of atrocities in the Sudanese city of el-Fasher have sparked international condemnation. The RSF has been accused of committing mass killings, ethnic cleansing and sexual violence after last month's seizure of the city, the last major location that remained outside of their control in the vast western region of Darfur.The paramilitary group, once an ally of the army, has repeatedly denied the abuses, though last month the militia's leader, Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, declared an investigation into \"violations\" committed by his soldiers.Both sides have been accused of war crimes during the conflict that erupted in April 2023.",

    "body": "4 hours agoAmy WalkerandPaul PradierFour more people have been arrested as part of the investigation into last month's theft of precious jewellery at the Louvre Museum, the Paris prosecutor's office says.Two men, aged 38 and 39, and two women, aged 31 and 40, were arrested on Tuesday. They are all from the Paris region.Among them is thought to be the last member of a four-man gang that allegedly carried out the daylight heist, according to French media. The other three suspected thieves have already been arrested and charged, officials say. Police now have up to 96 hours to question them. No trace has so far been found of the stolen jewels - worth  €88m (£76m; $102m) - which were taken on 19 October.Four people have already charged over the heist - three men and a woman, who also live in the Paris region. A 38-year-old woman was charged earlier this month with complicity in organised theft and criminal conspiracy with a view to committing a crime.Separately, a man, aged 37, was charged with theft and criminal conspiracy.These two suspects, who have not been named publicly, have denied any involvement.Ms Beccuau previously told French news agency Franceinfo said the two were in a relationship and had children together, without giving any further details. Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen A tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenMeanwhile, two men were charged with theft and criminal conspiracy in October after officials said they had \"partially recognised\" their involvement in the heist.The heist happened when the group of four men used a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine, Beccuau has previously said. The men used a disc cutter to crack open display cases housing the jewellery.The thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38, before switching to cars.One of the stolen items - a crown - was dropped during the escape but eight other items of jewellery - including an emerald-and-diamond necklace that Napoleon I gave his second wife, Empress Marie-Louise - were taken. Beccuau has said the heist was carried out by petty criminals rather than organised crime professionals.Shortly after the theft, it was revealed by the Louvre's director that the only camera monitoring the Galerie d'Apollon was pointing away from a balcony the thieves climbed over to break in.The president of the Louvre, Laurence des Cars, has since admitted the museum had failed in its responsibilities, but denied that security had been overlooked - saying that from the time she took office in 2021 she had been warning constantly of the need for more investment.Since the incident, security measures have been tightened around France's cultural institutions.The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following the heist.",

    "body": "4 hours agoUche Akolisa,BBC Igbo,Michael Ngene,BBC Igbo,Amaka Ewuzie,BBC IgboandNatasha BootyNigerian actor, content creator and influencer Odira Nwobu has died in South Africa aged 43, his lawyer and the Actors' Guild of Nigeria have told the BBC.News of his death has shocked many at home in Nigeria, prompting an outpouring of grief online from fans and colleagues alike for the Nollywood star who was in more than 60 films during his lifetime and was well-known for his comedic persona and babyface.Nwobu's family have yet to comment publicly.It is not yet known what caused the actor's death on Monday. A coroner's report is expected soon, his lawyer Chukwujiekwu Chukwudi said.Videos appearing to show the lifeless body of the actor began circulating online on Monday, causing upset.Mr Chukwudi told the BBC's Igbo service that an ambulance was called to Nwobu's hotel in the town of Benoni, near Johannesburg, after he was discovered alone in his room \"gasping for breath\".Paramedics attempted to keep the actor alive using a defibrillator, but he died at the scene before they could take him to hospital, his lawyer added.Born in Nigeria's south-eastern state of Enugu in 1982, Odira Nwobu landed his first professional role - in a film called Joseph the Dreamer - straight out of secondary school.He had a prolific career but struggled with feeling typecast, he told BBC News Igbo back in 2021, which made him turn to content creation as a way to find more freedom. Across his TikTok, Instagram and YouTube accounts he amassed hundreds of thousands of followers.At the time of his death, Nwobu had been visiting South Africa with a group of social media influencers in order to promote a real estate company belonging to a Nigerian, said president of the Actors' Guild of Nigeria Emeka Rollas.Nwobu's lawyer had accompanied them as he is the legal adviser to the Nigerian firm that organised the trip.\"[We] were shocked to receive calls from Nigeria to confirm the passing away of the young man, while we were still debating how to break the news to his family,\" Mr Chukwudi said.In July, Nwobu survived a road accident which at the time led many people to wrongly speculate that he had died.The actor was not married and is not survived by any children, reports say.Additional reporting by Adline Okere",

    "body": "1 day agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent , Geneva Donald Trump wants a peace deal in Ukraine very badly.Kyiv wants peace even more, just not at any cost.That's why when the US began pushing it to agree to a deal by Thanksgiving on what looked close to surrender terms, Ukraine pushed back.It scrambled senior officials to talks in Geneva and all of Sunday we saw delegates from the US and Ukraine shuttling back and forth between the two main venues in black limousines with darkened windows.They were joined by national security advisers from Germany, France and the UK.The only time I glimpsed Andriy Yermak, heading the negotiating team from Kyiv, he looked stony-faced.No wonder: the starting proposal on the table was so skewed towards Russia's demands, the talks began with the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio having to deny it had been written by the Kremlin.But Donald Trump had been clear that Ukraine needed to sign up fast or face unspecified consequences. So Kyiv had to engage.On Sunday night, Marco Rubio declared there'd been \"tremendous progress\" in the talks with just a \"couple of things\" still outstanding. When pressed, he wouldn't be more specific, calling the situation \"delicate\".But a joint Ukraine-US statement says there's now a whole new deal in play, which it calls an \"updated and revised framework document\".We haven't seen that yet. The Financial Times newspaper quotes one of the delegates, though - Ukraine's deputy foreign minister Sergiy Kyslytsya - who talks of a new 19-point plan with \"very little left\" from the original draft.That new document likely incorporates at least some of the amendments proposed by the Europeans and published by Reuters news agency that point to something far more palatable for Kyiv.In that version, an automatic veto on future Ukrainian Nato membership is gone - as well as a cap on troop numbers for the country's armed forces.It says no Western troops would be deployed to Ukraine permanently, but that's not an all-out ban.On the sensitive question of territory – land Ukrainian soldiers have been fighting and dying to defend for 11 years – there would be no handover of the rest of the Donbas region to Russia for free, and Ukraine would aim to recover occupied areas through exclusively diplomatic means. That's something Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously accepted. The full amnesty for war crimes is deleted, too.But most critically, there's reference to security guarantees.Several officials, including the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, have talked about Ukraine getting Article 5-style protection, meaning the US would be bound to come to its defence if Russia ever invaded again.That's the key issue which Ukraine says it can't negotiate on.We don't know how many of these European ideas have made it into the new proposal, but Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz calls the deal \"significantly modified\" – in a positive sense.So how did we get from a pro-Russian deal to this in just a day? It's hard to be sure, with US hawks like President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff in the room.The initial Kremlin-friendly plan was rooted in Witkoff's own visit to Russian President Vladimir Putin this spring, when he returned quoting Russia's controversial narratives almost verbatim.Instead, this plan seems like something Ukraine might sign up to – eventually.Which must be why Trump has gone from berating officials in Kyiv, again, for supposedly showing him \"zero gratitude\", to proclaiming that \"something good\" may be coming.But how good? There is still no sign that Russia is ready to give up fighting unless it's forced to.\"Putin is much more self-confident militarily, right now,\" Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center believes.She points to a corruption scandal and political crisis in Kyiv, problems mobilising soldiers there, and military gains for Russian forces on the ground – all driving Putin's thinking.At best, some suggest Trump's demand for a deal has injected new momentum into efforts to find peace, which Ukrainians, under fire, desperately want.But it's hard to escape the sense that these days of frantic diplomacy have only brought us back to where we started\"Russia's position is, 'we have laid out our demands, so do you take them or not?' Stanovaya said. \"'If so, we will stop the war – if not, we'll just wait until you're ready.'\"",

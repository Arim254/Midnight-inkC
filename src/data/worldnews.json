    "body": "What growing up in war does to a child's brain - and how it really affects them years later1 day agoFergal KeaneSpecial correspondent BBCContent warning: this article includes details about the impact of conflict on children in war zones and descriptions of injuries that some readers may find distressing.The first thing was that Abdelrahman's dad was killed. The family home was struck by an Israeli air strike. The boy's mum, Asma al-Nashash, 29, remembers that \"they brought him out in pieces\".Then on 16 July 2024 an air strike hit the school in Nuseirat, central Gaza. Eleven-year-old Abdelrahman was seriously wounded. Doctors had to amputate his leg.His mental state began to deteriorate. \"He started pulling his hair and hitting himself hard,\" Asma recalls. \"He became like someone who has depression, seeing his friends playing and running around… and he's sitting alone.\"When I meet Abdelrahman at a hospital in Jordan in May 2025, he is withdrawn and wary. Dozens of children have been evacuated to the Kingdom from Gaza for medical treatment.\"We will return to Gaza,\" he tells me. \"We will die there.\"Abdelrahman is one of thousands of traumatised children I've met in my nearly four decades of reporting on conflicts. Certain faces are embedded in my memory. Some as though I had only met them yesterday. They reflect the depth of terror inflicted on children in our time.AFP via Getty ImagesAFP via Getty ImagesAFP via Getty ImagesHundreds of thousands of children have lived through more than two years of war in GazaThe first was on a hilltop in Eritrea in the mid-1980s. Adonai Mikael was a child victim of an Ethiopian napalm strike, crying in agony as the wind blew dust on to his wounds. The cries, the expression of pure agony in his eyes sent me fleeing from the tent where he was being treated. In Belfast a few years later, I remember a boy following the coffin of his father, blown up by the IRA. Never before had I seen such a distance in anyone's eyes.In Sierra Leone during the civil war, there was the girl whose hands were hacked off by a drunken militiaman; from Soweto there is the image of a child helping her mother mop the blood of a murder victim on their doorstep; and in Rwanda the boy who broke down when I asked him why the other children called him \"Grenade\" – a moment of insensitivity I will always regret.He had been wounded by an explosion that killed his parents.Figures underscore the sheer scale of the crisis. In 2024, 520 million children were living in conflict zones - one in every five children worldwide - according to an analysis by the Peace Research Institute Oslo, which pieced together conflict records with population data to arrive at the estimate.Prof Theresa Betancourt, author of Shadows into Light, a book about former child soldiers, calls this \"the largest humanitarian disaster since World War Two\".She warns trauma has an impact that lasts long into the future. \"[It can affect] the developing architecture of the brain in young children, with lifelong consequences for learning, behaviour, and both physical and mental health.\"But given how much time has been spent researching the impact of war on children's minds, what can help?This is a question that has never been more relevant following this period of multiple global conflicts that have affected millions of children: from those Sudanese children who, in October, saw their mothers and sisters raped by militiamen in el-Fasher, Darfur; the youngsters abducted from Israel by Hamas on 7 October, 2023, many having witnessed the slaughter of family and neighbours; the children of Bucha in Ukraine whose parents were among the people massacred by Russian troops in February 2022; and the hundreds of thousands of children like Abdelrahman who have endured more than two years of war in Gaza.AFP via Getty ImagesGetty ImagesSudanese refugees in 2025I should declare a personal interest. I suffered from post traumatic stress disorder – PTSD both as a child in a broken home, and later as an adult, witnessing war and genocide. Though different from experiencing war as a child, I know the symptoms all too well: the extreme anxiety, hypervigilance – being constantly on guard against threats - flashbacks, nightmares, and depression. The symptoms were severe enough to require several hospitalisations.Personal experience has made me intensely curious about how children respond and are treated.\"The evidence is quite solid across different studies that the exposure to war and displacement is associated with a higher risk of mental health problems,\" says Michael Pluess, a professor of psychology at the University of Surrey.He has carried out long-term research into the children of Syrian war refugees, and cautions against making assumptions. \"It's important to recognise that children differ in how they respond.\"A variety of factors can influence the outcome. How long was the child exposed to the traumatic events? Were they physically wounded? Did they lose an important person in their life, or see them killed or injured? Did they have physical security and emotional support in the aftermath?In a sample of 2,976 children from Bosnia-Herzegovina - all of whom had been exposed to war and were aged between nine and 14 - high levels of post-traumatic symptoms and grief symptoms were reported.Getty ImagesGetty ImagesGetty ImagesBosnia-Herzegovina: Children in SarajevoBut there is the potential for long-term health damage – heart disease, autoimmune problems - linked to \"toxic stress\", where the body is flooded with hormones like cortisol and catecholamines, which produce adrenaline.There is also a developing field of research into epigenetics, which asks whether the experience of trauma by one generation can show up in later generations through changes in the way our genes behave.Are we more susceptible to, say, poor mental health, addictions or other health problems if our families have a history of trauma - and how much has this to do with genetics versus our family setups and everyday lives?The family drip-feed effectEpigenetics is a tentative and debated area of scientific research with much still to be learned.\"I think there is some evidence that there is a sort of intergenerational transmission of trauma,\" says Prof Pluess. \"Some of that or much of that will happen through social practice rather than biological practice, but there's some evidence to suggest that there are some epigenetic factors as well.\"Prof Metin Başoğlu, director of the Istanbul Centre for Behavioural Sciences, is sceptical. However, he says it is possible that certain temperament traits (for example, predispositions that are transmitted genetically across generations) might make some people more vulnerable to traumatic events.During research for a book on my own PTSD, I remember a conversation with one of Britain's most eminent experts in the field, Prof Simon Wessely, former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. I wondered whether my own family history – great-grandparents born during the Irish famine, a grandmother who was traumatised by her war experiences in the 1920s – could have made me more genetically predisposed to PTSD?\"There is simply no way of knowing, without studying a representative sample group from the same area, with ancestors born in the same place and subjected to the same conditions,\" he told me. \"I can't do it on one person…\"What I think is much easier to understand - and, I think, is also the most powerful - is the influence of our background. And it's absolutely impossible for you to have grown up in the household that you did, with the interests that you have, for that not to have the same effect on you.\"AFP via Getty ImagesAFP via Getty ImagesProf Pluess has carried out long-term research into the children of Syrian war refugees, and cautions against making assumptionsThere is broader consensus that trauma is a family crisis. It isn't only a question of what a child witnesses or survives – there is also the impact on adults.\"Not only do children in war zones face the death of caregivers and traumatic separations,\" says Prof Betancourt, \"but caregivers experiencing their own trauma and distress may not be fully available to help protect and guide their children through the horrors of war.\"Prof Pluess's research among Syrian refugees supports this. Among the 80% of children found to be vulnerable to more than one psychological disorder, family circumstances were critical.Around 1,600 families took part in a study, published in 2022, of Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Prof Pluess says that children's living conditions (such as access to safe housing, food, and schooling) were found to be \"about 10 times more predictive of their mental health\".Children who adapted more healthily may have \"had a social environment that was very protective, maybe the parents were able to shield them, maybe they had close friendships, relationships, maybe they have access to school, all those external things that sort of buffer the negative impact of war exposure.\"The roots of this knowledge in Britain go back to WW2 and the experience of children who lived through the Blitz – the eight months of German air attacks between September 1940 and May 1941.Getty ImagesHulton-Deutsch Collection/Corbis via Getty ImagesFox Photos/Getty Images\"The evidence is quite solid [...] exposure to war and displacement is associated with a higher risk of mental health problems,\" says Prof PluessProf Edgar Jones, of King's College London, points to a study of 212 children treated at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children during the war. When researchers went back to the children in 1949 – four years after the conflict ended – they found only 21% had recovered. The role of parents – both positive and negative – emerged as an important finding.\"The severity of a child's reaction to bombing was judged to be influenced by their parents' response to the trauma either to accentuate or calm their anxiety,\" says Prof Jones.Overcoming fear and establishing controlIn my own experience, therapy and medication helped, but also the ongoing support of family and friends. Without the power of caring relationships I don't believe I could have emerged from the darkness.I was also encouraged to confront my avoidance of anything that might remind me of the trauma. For example, I went through a long period of avoiding travel to the continent of Africa, fearing that simply being there would trigger reminders of the Rwandan genocide. But my therapist gradually encouraged me to face the fear. It took several years but I did return, and continue to visit places there that are dear to my heart.Prof Başoğlu pioneered the use of what is called CFBT – Control Focused Behavioural Treatment - among survivors of the 1999 Turkish earthquake, which killed about 18,000 people.The idea is to encourage the individual to take control of their fear of the event recurring. In the case of children who were constantly clinging to their parents, this was attempted by encouraging them to get used to sleeping alone.\"Once they overcome their fear, all the traumatic stress reactions that are associated with fear also improve,\" Prof Başoğlu says.Israeli psychologists working with children released from Hamas captivity after the 7 October attacks also stress the importance of re-establishing a sense of control.Getty ImagesAFP via Getty ImagesGetty ImagesGlobal conflicts have affected millions of children, including the young people abducted from Israel by Hamas on 7 October, 2023, those who witnessed the slaughter of family and neighbours that day, and those dealing with the aftermathIn a paper for the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health journal, a team of Israeli specialists wrote that this was achieved \"by providing survivors with information and space to express their concerns while ensuring that their needs and voices are heard\".But successful interventions depend greatly on creating a stable environment where the fear of being killed or maimed is not an ever-present reality.\"What they also need is that their parents are well, that they live in a safe place, that they have access to education, that they have a routine, that they have some predictability,\" says Prof Pluess.This is rarely certain in areas ravaged by war. Ceasefires break down. Front lines become frozen. The displaced are stuck in camps.'We were dehumanised'Still, those words about a safe place bring to mind my friend Beata and the difference stability made to her life.She was 15 years old when the Rwandan genocide – the worst mass slaughter since the Nazi Holocaust – erupted in 1994. Up to 800,000 people, mostly members of the Tutsi minority, were massacred over a period of 100 days.As a reporter I travelled on the convoy that evacuated dozens of orphaned children - Beata Umubyeyi Mairesse among them - through roadblocks manned by the murderous Interahamwe militia. It was a terrifying experience, but especially for the children whose families had been killed.From roadblock to roadblock, we did not know if the machete-wielding gangs would attack.Years later when she was researching her experiences (later published in a book, The Convoy), Beata got in touch. I remember being struck by her composure and openness. She is married with two children, lives in France and is now a successful writer.\"The first thing that helped me was exile to France, leaving the scene of the genocide. I found myself safe, in a peaceful place, with shelter, a foster family who took care of all my material needs, and the opportunity to see a psychologist. I went back to school in September, and that helped me too.\"VCG via Getty ImagesMirrorpix/Getty ImagesLiaison/ Getty ImagesGlobal conflicts that have affected millions of children - in 1994, up to 800,000 people were massacred in Rwanda over a period of 100 days Beata was joined by her mother who also survived. Her father had died before the slaughter.Composed as she was, there were lingering terrors. She panicked one night when classical music was played on the radio – similar to music played on Rwandan radio the night the genocide began. Fireworks or the sound of hunters shooting sent her hiding under a desk in class \"because I thought war had broken out in France\".I wondered if she makes a conscious effort to protect her children from the traumatic inheritance of genocide. \"There are things that are difficult to tell your children, how we were dehumanised, how I was almost raped. The term 'unspeakable' makes sense when passing on stories to children. We are afraid of contaminating them with our trauma.\"But for Beata, nuance is vital. \"Their only image of Rwanda should not be the genocide. I told them stories from my childhood and every time I went there I brought them back fruit so that they could also discover a country full of flavour.\"Although she lives a full and happy life, Beata still suffers from anxiety and takes anti-depressants to deal with insomnia. I also use medication, and like Beata I do not see it as a burden or a stigma. Rather I count myself fortunate to be able to access care and medicine.Fergal Keane (second from right) in Rwanda after the genocideCreating a safe community is also seen as critical by many experts.\"They're not just victims of mental health,\" says Prof Pluess. \"They're little people with interests and that's why they need to go to school, they need to have opportunities to play together - and that might be as important as dealing with the mental health problems that they're facing.\"Psychologists working in Gaza are well aware of these needs. Davide Musardo, who volunteered with Medecins Sans Frontieres, has written of trying to provide therapy against the background of drones and explosions.\"In Gaza, one survives but the exposure to trauma is constant. Everything is missing, even the idea of a future. For people, the greatest anguish is not of today — the bombs, the fighting, and the mourning — but of the aftermath. There is little confidence about peace and reconstruction, and the children I saw in the hospital showed clear signs of regression.\"It is possible, in devastated Gaza, that the current ceasefire will become a permanent peace, allowing rebuilding, and the restoration of family life and schooling. Possible but by no means certain. In Sudan there are attempts to re-start talks about peace but little optimism for their outcome. The war in Ukraine, and many other wars grind on every day.Trauma is as old as war itself. Politicians, journalists, and experts looking to the aftermath of a conflict often ask, \"What will happen when the killing stops?\" But somewhere else the killing will continue. That is the relentless tragedy of children caught in wars they did not start, over which they have no control. For all the knowledge gained about treating trauma, humanity is far from dealing with its root cause – war itself.Additional reporting by Harriet WhiteheadTop picture credit: EPA/ShutterstockMore from InDepthBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Thieves used a large drill to break into a safe at a high street bank branch in western Germany and steal an estimated €30m (£26m; $35m) in cash and valuables, police have said.A police spokesman likened the break-in to the Hollywood heist film Ocean's Eleven, telling AFP news agency it was \"very professionally executed\".During the heist at Sparkasse savings bank in the city of Gelsenkirchen, thieves broke open more than 3,000 safe deposit boxes containing money, gold and jewellery. Gelsenkirchen Police said they became aware of the crime after a fire alarm was set off in the early hours of Monday morning.Currently, no arrests have been made and the perpetrators remain at large.Police said the thieves had used the \"quiet Christmas days\" to rob the building on Nienhofstrasse in the Buer district.Initial investigations suggest they gained access to the bank, and escaped, via an adjacent parking garage.Witnesses have reported seeing several men carrying large bags in the staircase of the garage overnight on Saturday into Sunday. Police said video footage shows a black Audi RS 6 leaving the garage, on De-La-Chevallerie-Strasse, early on Monday morning.The hole into the underground vault room was discovered when a fire alarm went off in the early hours of Monday, and police and the fire brigade searched the building.Affected bank customers have been asked to contact Sparkasse bank, which has set up a hotline. Police secured the entrance of the branch on Tuesday after a large number of customers gathered outside demanding information.\"I couldn't sleep last night. We're getting no information,\" one man told the Welt broadcaster, according to Reuters, as he waited outside the branch, adding that it contained his savings for old age.A message on the bank's website said the branch would remain closed on Tuesday following the break-in.Sparkasse said 95% of customers' safe deposit boxes had been forced open by the thieves, so the likelihood they were affected is \"very high\". It added that the contents of each compartment are insured up to €10,300 and told customers to check if they had additional coverage through their home insurance.",

    "body": "Protests and strikes in Iran over inflation and currency devaluation have spread from the capital, Tehran, to several other cities on a third day of unrest.The protests began on Sunday after shopkeepers in Tehran's Grand Bazaar staged a strike when the Iranian rial hit a record low against the US dollar on the open market.Since then, videos verified by BBC Persian have shown demonstrations in the cities of Karaj, Hamedan, Qeshm, Malard, Isfahan, Kermanshah, Shiraz and Yazd. Police were also seen using tear gas in an attempt to disperse demonstrators.The Iranian government said it \"recognises the protests\" and would listen \"with patience, even if it is confronted with harsh voices\".President Masoud Pezeshkian wrote on X late on Monday that he had instructed the interior minister to hold talks with what he described as \"representatives\" of the protesters so that measures could be taken \"to resolve the problems and act responsibly\".He also accepted the resignation of Iran's central bank governor, Mohammadreza Farzin, and named former economy and finance minister Abdolnasser Hemmati to replace him.University students have also joined the protests, chanting anti-government slogans including \"Death to the dictator\" - a reference to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate power in Iran.Some protesters were also heard chanting slogans in support of the son of the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, including \"Long live the Shah\".In response, Reza Pahlavi, who lives in exile in the United States, wrote on X: \"I am with you. Victory is ours because our cause is just and because we are united.\"\"As long as this regime remains in power, the country's economic situation will continue to deteriorate,\" he added.The US state department's Persian-language account on X also expressed support for the protests.It said the US \"praises their courage\" and stands with those seeking \"dignity and a better future\" after years of failed policies and economic mismanagement.Iran was reportedly high on the agenda of a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Florida on Monday,At a joint news conference afterwards, Trump declined to say whether he supported regime change in Iran, but said: \"They've got a lot of problems: tremendous inflation, their economy is bust, their economy is no good, and I know people aren't so happy.\"The president also said he might back another round of Israeli air strikes on Iran if the country rebuilt its ballistic missile or nuclear programmes.During a 12-day war between Israel and Iran in June, the US carried out air strikes on key Iranian uranium enrichment sites. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful.President Pezeshkian vowed on Tuesday that Iran's response to \"any oppressive act of aggression\" would be \"severe and regret-inducing\".Iran's supreme leader has repeatedly said that Israel's government hoped mass protests would erupt in Iran during the war and topple the regime.\"They wanted to create sedition on the streets... But people were absolutely not influenced by what the enemy wanted,\" Khamenei said in September.",

    "body": "Israel is to revoke the licenses of 37 aid groups working in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, saying they failed to meet requirements under new registration rules.Well-known international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) such as ActionAid, the International Rescue Committee and the Norwegian Refugee Council are among those that will have their licenses suspended on 1 January, with their operations to end within 60 days. Israel said the groups, among other things, had failed to hand over \"complete\" personal details of their staff. The move was heavily criticised by foreign ministers from 10 countries including the UK, who said the new rules were \"restrictive\" and \"unacceptable\".In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of the UK, France, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland said the forced closure of INGO operations would \"have a severe impact on access to essential services including healthcare\".They added that the humanitarian situation in Gaza remained \"catastrophic\" and  called on Israel's government to ensure INGOs were able to operate \"in a sustained and predictable way\". Israel's Ministry of Diaspora Affairs, which is in charge of registration applications, said the new measures would not impact the flow of humanitarian assistance to Gaza.It added that aid continued to be delivered through \"approved and vetted channels\", including UN agencies, bilateral partners, and humanitarian organisations. It said the primary reason aid groups were having their licences revoked was \"the refusal to provide complete and verifiable information regarding their employees,\" which it said was critical to preventing \"the infiltration of terrorist operatives into humanitarian structures\". Earlier this month, UN-backed experts said there had been improvements in nutrition and food supplies in Gaza since a ceasefire was brokered between Israel and Hamas in October, but 100,000 people still experienced \"catastrophic conditions\" the following month. Israeli military body Cogat, which controls Gaza's crossings, said the organisations that will be suspended \"did not bring aid into Gaza throughout the current ceasefire\". It added that \"even in the past their combined contribution amounted to only about 1% of the total aid volume\". The Ministry of Diaspora Affairs said that fewer than 15% of organisations providing humanitarian assistance to Gaza were found to be in violation of the new regulatory framework. That framework includes several grounds for rejection, including:Denying the existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic stateDenying the Holocaust or the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023Supporting an armed struggle against Israel by an enemy state or terrorist organisationPromoting \"delegitimisation campaigns\" against IsraelCalling for a boycott of Israel or committing to participate in oneSupporting the prosecution of Israeli security forces in foreign or international courtsThe Humanitarian Country Team of the Occupied Palestinian Territory - a forum that brings together UN agencies and more than 200 local and international organisations - previously warned that the new registration system \"fundamentally jeopardises\" the operations of INGOs in Gaza and the West Bank. \"The system relies on vague, arbitrary, and highly politicised criteria and imposes requirements that humanitarian organisations cannot meet without violating international legal obligations or compromising core humanitarian principles,\" it said.It added: \"While some INGOs have been registered under the new system, these INGOs represent only a fraction of the response in Gaza and are nowhere near the number required just to meet immediate and basic needs.\"According to the Humanitarian Country Team, INGOs currently run or support most of Gaza's field hospitals and primary healthcare centres, emergency shelter responses, water and sanitation services, nutrition stabilisation centres for children with acute malnutrition, and critical mine action activities.In a statement, Israel's Minister of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, Amichai Chikli, said: \"The message is clear: humanitarian assistance is welcome — the exploitation of humanitarian frameworks for terrorism is not.\"Other organisations to be suspended include CARE, Medico International and Medical Aid for Palestinians.

    "body": "Donald Trump said he hoped to reach phase two of the Gaza peace plan \"very quickly\", as he warned Hamas would have \"hell to pay\" if it did not disarm soon.The US president, whose 20-point peace plan requires the militant group to disarm, made the comments as he met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Florida for talks on Monday. During a press conference with Netanyahu after their meeting, Trump said Israel had \"lived up to the plan 100%\", despite continuing attacks by its military in Gaza.The US president also said his country could support another major strike on Iran were it to resume rebuilding its ballistic missile or nuclear weapons programmes.In response to Trump's threat, Iran's supreme leader's top political adviser, Ali Shamkhani, said on X that any aggression towards Iran would be met with an \"immediate harsh response\".Asked how quickly Hamas and Israel should move to phase two of the peace plan,  Trump said: \"As quickly as we can. But there has to be disarmament.\"Speaking about Hamas, he said: \"If they don't disarm as, as they agreed to do, they agreed to it, and then there will be hell to pay for them.\"They have to disarm in a fairly short period of time\".Trump also said reconstruction in Gaza could \"begin pretty soon\".The Gaza peace plan came into effect in October. Under the second phase, a technocratic government would be established in the devastated territory, Hamas would disarm and Israeli troops would withdraw. The reconstruction of Gaza would then begin.But critics have suggested Netanyahu could seek to delay the process of the plan and instead push for Hamas to disarm before Israeli troops withdraw. The Israeli prime minister has been accused of not wanting to engage seriously with the issue of a political future for Palestinians. Hamas officials have said a full disarmament should take place alongside progress towards an independent Palestinian state.Asked if he was concerned Israel was not moving fast enough to phase two of the plan, Trump said it had \"lived up to the plan\".\"I'm not concerned about anything that Israel's doing, I'm concerned about what other people are doing or maybe aren't doing,\" he added.Since the ceasefire came into effect, at least 414 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.The Israeli military, which controls more than half of Gaza, has said it has only opened fire in response to ceasefire violations. It has blamed Hamas for the killings of three Israeli soldiers over the same period.During the press briefing, Trump also warned that the US would launch further attacks on Iran if it was found to be using different sites to develop nuclear weapons.In June, Trump claimed US air and missile strikes \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear facilities. Iran has denied seeking to develop nuclear weapons. \"I hope they're not trying to build up again, because if they are we're going to have no choice but to eradicate that build up,\" he said. Trump said he \"had been reading\" that the country was using \"possibly different sites\" to those targeted in summer.Iran, which fought a 12-day war with Israel in June, on Monday denounced the reports as a \"psychological operation\" against Tehran. It said it was fully prepared to defend itself, and warned renewed aggression would \"result in harsher consequences\" for Israel.Trump and Netanyahu's talks also focused on other regional tension points, including Syria and the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon.Netanyahu said on Monday that Israel was keen to ensure a peaceful border with Syria, and Trump said he hoped Israel would get along with President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who took power after longtime strongman Bashar al-Assad was deposed last year.Israel has been suspicious of the new leader, who was once a member of al-Qaeda, and bombed government buildings in Damascus in July.\"Well, I hope he's [Netanyahu] going to get along with Syria because the new president of Syria is working very hard to do a good job,\" Trump said. \"He really is. I know he's a tough cookie. And, you know, you're not going to get a choir boy to lead Syria.\" Trump signed an executive order in June to end US sanctions against Syria.",

    "body": "18 hours agoSofia Ferreira SantosX/Ali YerlikayaA video shared on social media by Turkey's interior minister appears to show several people being detainedMore than 350 suspected Islamic State group (IS) members have been detained as part of nationwide police operations in Turkey.Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said 357 suspects were apprehended across 21 provinces in coordinated raids on Tuesday morning.It comes just a day after three police officers and six alleged militants were killed during an eight hour siege in the northwestern town of Yalova. Another eight police officers and a security force member were injured.Less than a week ago, authorities arrested another 115 suspects who prosecutors said had been planning attacks targeting non-Muslims during Christmas and New Year's.In a post on X, Yerlikaya said Tuesday's operations took place across the country, including in Ankara, Istanbul and Yalova.\"Just as we have never given an opportunity to those who try to bring this country to its knees with terrorism, we will never give them an opportunity in the future either,\" he added.The interior minister also shared a video appearing to show dozens of counter-terrorism officers taking part in the operations and detaining several people.Raids on addresses in Istanbul and two other provinces - where 110 people were detained, according to the prosecutor's office - saw officers seize documents and digital materials, while pictures on local media also showed a number of weapons, including knifes and bullets.A statement from the Istanbul chief prosecutor's office said intelligence had suggested the suspects might attempt an attack on New Year's Day.It also noted 41 of those detained had suspected links to the clash in Yalova on Monday.Interior minister Yerlikaya said another 16 individuals had been detained in Yalova for making \"provocative posts\" on social media.The funerals of the three offices killed in Yalova - named as  İlker Pehlivan, Turgut Külünk, and Yasin Koçyiğit - were held on Tuesday.President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan offered his condolences to their families, and said Turkey would continue its fight against \"bloodthirsty criminals who threaten the peace of our nation and the security of our state\".Earlier this month, authorities carried out mass raids and arrested 115 people. Officials said IS supporters had been actively planning attacks across Turkey, particularly against non-Muslims on Christmas and New Year's Day.ReutersThe siege on a house in Yalova lasted around eight hours, according to local mediaTurkey's security services regularly target people with suspected links to IS.The country shares a 900km (560 mile) border with Syria, where the group continues to operate in parts of the country.Syria's president Ahmed al-Sharaa, who has close ties to the Turkish government, has vowed to work with the US and Europe to root out surviving elements of IS.The US launched a wave of air strikes against the group's positions across Syria on Friday in response to the killing of three Americans.Two US soldiers and a civilian interpreter were killed by IS gunmen during an ambush earlier this month.",

    "body": "The two alleged gunmen who killed 15 people at a Jewish event on Bondi Beach were not part of a wider terror cell and acted alone, Australian police have said.Police also confirmed Sajid Akram, 50, and his son Naveed Akram, 24, travelled to the Philippines on 1 November, landing in the capital Manila before transiting that day to Davao City. They returned to Sydney on 29 November.The pair did not undergo training or \"logistical preparation\" in the Philippines for the 14 December attack with early investigations from local authorities suggesting they \"rarely left their hotel,\" police said.Police have declared the attack - Australia's worst mass shooting since 1996 - a terrorist incident.Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett told media on Tuesday that CCTV footage tracking the alleged gunmen's movements in the Philippines had been handed to Australian authorities. \"We are currently reviewing the material,\" she said, adding that initial assessments show that \"these individuals are alleged to have acted alone\".\"There is no evidence to suggest these alleged offenders were part of a broader terrorist cell, or were directed by others to carry out an attack.\"But nor were the pair in the Philippines for tourism, Commissioner Barrett said.She emphasised that as the investigation was ongoing, new evidence or information may emerge.Earlier, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said it appears both alleged gunmen were  \"motivated by Islamic State\" ideology.Sajid Akram was shot dead by police during the attack in which he and his son Naveed - both armed with long-barrelled guns - allegedly shot attendees at a Hanukkah event on Bondi Beach.Naveed, who was hospitalised after the attack, has been charged with 59 offences including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act and is due to face court in April.In the days after the shooting, the Philippines immigration bureau told the BBC that the father had entered the country using an Indian passport while his son used an Australian passport. Immigration spokesperson Dana Sandoval said the duo had declared the southern city of Davao as their final destination and their return flight to Australia was for Sydney.Davao is a sprawling metropolis on the east of the Philippines' main southern island, Mindanao. Islamist militants have been known to operate in impoverished parts of central and south-western Mindanao.Additional reporting by Virma Simonette.",

    "body": "10 hours agoDavid GrittenEPAThe UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) seeks independence for southern YemenThe United Arab Emirates has said it will withdraw its remaining forces from Yemen, after Saudi Arabia backed a demand from the Yemeni presidential council for them to leave within 24 hours.The Emirati announcement followed an air strike by a Saudi-led military coalition on what it said was a weapons shipment for UAE-backed separatist forces in the southern port of Mukalla.The UAE denied the shipment contained weapons and expressed \"deep regret\" at the Saudi accusations. Saudi and the UAE have been allies in the war against Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi movement over the past decade, but the infighting between the rival factions they support has deepened a rift between them.Saudi Arabia also accused the UAE of \"pressuring\" the separatists to attack Saudi-backed government forces in two eastern provinces, and warned it would take measures to confront such \"highly dangerous\" actions.On Tuesday afternoon, the UAE's defence ministry put out a statement announcing \"the termination of the remaining counterterrorism personnel in Yemen of its own volition\", six years after the UAE's armed forces had \"concluded\" their presence.The ministry explained that the decision to withdraw them was made \"in light of recent developments and their potential implications for the safety and effectiveness of counterterrorism missions\", without mentioning the coalition strike or Saudi warning.The strongly worded statement issued by Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry on Tuesday morning said it was working to \"contain the escalatory steps\" taken recently by the Southern Transitional Council (STC), which seeks independence for southern Yemen.It accused the UAE of \"pressuring\" the STC to conduct offensives in the eastern provinces of Hadramawt and al-Mahra, which it said constituted \"a threat to the kingdom's national security, and the security and stability of the Republic of Yemen and the region\". It also warned that Saudi Arabia would take measures to confront such \"highly dangerous\" actions.The UAE's foreign ministry denounced the allegations that it \"exerted pressure on, or issued directives to, any Yemeni party to undertake military operations that would undermine the security of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or target its borders\".It also insisted that the UAE had \"focused on containing the situation, supporting de-escalation efforts, and promoting understandings to contribute to preserving security and stability\" since the start of the STC's offensives.The head of Yemen's eight-member presidential council - which includes STC representatives - earlier announced that he was cancelling a joint defence pact with the UAE and ordering its forces to leave within 24 hours \"in the interest of safeguarding the security of all citizens, affirming commitment to Yemen's unity, sovereignty, stability, and territorial integrity\".Rashad al-Alimi also declared a state of emergency for a period of 90 days, which he said was necessary to confront the Houthis and what he described as \"the internal strife led by mutinous military elements that received orders from the United Arab Emirates\".The STC's leaders said the ultimatum for the UAE's withdrawal was unilateral and had no legal basis, and insisted the UAE would remain a \"main partner\" in the battle against the Houthis.AFPThe Saudi-led coalition air strike on Mukalla destroyed a number of military vehicles and pick-up trucksAlimi's announcement came after the spokesman of the Saudi-led coalition - which includes the UAE - said it had carried out a \"limited\" air strike on weapons and military vehicles for the STC's forces in the southern Yemeni port of Mukalla which arrived on two ships from the UAE.The shipments had constituted \"an imminent threat and an escalation that threatens peace and stability\", Maj-Gen Turki al-Maliki asserted.An official at the port told AFP news agency that a warning to evacuate was received at 04:00 local time (01:00 GMT) and that an open area at the facility was struck about 15 minutes later.Pictures showed a number of burned out military vehicles and pick-up trucks in a walled-off area at the port, as well as damage to a nearby building. No casualties were reported.The UAE's foreign ministry said it had been surprised by the strike on Mukalla and that the coalition statement had been issued without consultation with member states.It insisted that the shipment in question \"did not include any weapons, and that the vehicles unloaded were not intended for any Yemeni party but were shipped for use by Emirati forces operating in Yemen\".On Saturday, the Saudi-led coalition called on the STC's forces to withdraw \"peacefully\" from Hadramawt and al-Mahra, a day after the Saudi air force reportedly bombed positions held by the separatists in the Wadi Nahab area of Hadramawt.The STC's forces launched offensives in the two provinces amid rising tensions earlier this month, putting them in direct conflict with government forces.It said the operations were necessary to \"restore stability\" in the south and to combat the Houthis, as well as the jihadist groups al-Qaeda and Islamic State (IS).Yemen has been devastated by a civil war that began in 2014, when the Houthis ousted the internationally recognised government from the capital Sanaa. The conflict escalated in 2015, after the Saudi-led coalition of Arab states intervened to restore the government's rule.The fighting has reportedly left more than 150,000 people dead and triggered one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.At the start of the war, the STC and other separatists seeking independence for south Yemen, which was a separate country before unification with the north in 1990, formed an uneasy alliance with the government to stop the Houthis capturing the southern city of Aden.However, in recent years the STC and its allies have turned on the government and gradually seized control of Aden and much of the south of the country.",

    "body": "The Spanish parishioner who made headlines around the world for her botched restoration of a prized Jesus Christ fresco has died aged 94.Cecilia Giménez, an elderly woman from Borja, northeast Spain, became famous 13 years ago after she attempted to restore the century-old painting titled Ecce Homo that was held in her local church.Giménez's restoration went viral and earned the nickname \"Monkey Christ\", because of Christ's head resembling a hairy monkey. The 94-year-old's death was confirmed by Borja's mayor, Eduardo Arilla, in a Facebook post, in which he recognised her as a \"great lover of painting from a young age\".Mayor Arilla paid tribute to Giménez's \"famous restoration of Ecce Homo\" in August 2012, which \"due to the poor state of conservation it presented, Cecilia, with the best intentions, decided to repaint the work over\".The Ecce Homo (\"Behold the Man\" in Latin) by 19th century painter Elias Garcia Martinez has been held for more than 100 years in the Sanctuary of Mercy Church near Zaragoza. In 2012, Giménez, then 81, told BBC News that church members had \"always repaired everything here\", and that she had permission from the local priest to do so. Giménez said at the time anybody who entered the Church would have seen she was painting over the original. The impact of the restoration led to the \"Monkey Christ\" meme and saw the once quiet town of Borja quickly become a tourist destination. The town, which had previously welcomed just 5,000 visitors per year, received more than 40,000 tourists by 2013, and raised more than €50,000 for charity at the time. Officials say nowadays between 15,000 and 20,000 tourists per year visit Borja to see the famous portrait, which is now behind a protective shield of glass.After recovering from the backlash, with support from local residents and others around the world, Giménez went on to stage an art exhibition with 28 of her own paintings. She was praised by Borja's mayor for her generosity and years of dedication to the church. \"Rest in peace Cecilia, we will always remember you,\" Mayor Arilla wrote on Facebook.",

Earlier on Tuesday, Eurostar urged its customers \"to rebook their journey for another day if possible, with free exchanges available\".\"We also advise customers not to come to our stations if their trains have been already been cancelled.\"By midday on Tuesday, at least a dozen Eurostar services between the UK, France, Belgium and the Netherlands had been cancelled.The rail operator apologised and said passengers could rearrange their plans free of charge or can cancel their booking and get a refund or an e-voucher.Passengers told the BBC how they had been left stranded and looking for alternative routes to get to their destination. Two American tourists spent hundreds of pounds to reach Paris on Wednesday after their Eurostar service was cancelled from London St Pancras International.Haley Adams, 38, and Hannah Hagar, 35, paid $580 (£430) for flights to the French capital to celebrate Hannah's 36th birthday there.The pair had their Eurostar tickets refunded but said they will have to pay for an extra night at a hotel in London and cannot get a refund from the hotel they were going to stay at in Paris tonight.\"There's been a lot of queuing,\" Adams said. \"We have been here for five hours.\"Haley Adams and Hannah Hagar spent hundreds on alternative travel plansA family from Mexico said their trip of a lifetime has been cast into doubt as their Eurostar service was cancelled.Monserrat Hernandes, her brother John Paul and mother Olga were among dozens of people looking frantically at their phones near the Eurostar departure area at St Pancras.The family got on the Eurostar just after 08:00 GMT but after their train left for Paris it had to return due to the incident.\"They say nothing is travelling today… there's no hope for leaving tomorrow,\" she said.They are now searching for a flight or a ferry to make it to Paris.\"It's like an American movie,\" she added. \"Hopefully I find the love of my life.\"This Mexican family were trying to get to Paris for New Year's EveIn France, Ben Clark, from Bedfordshire, said he had been stuck on-board Le Shuttle in Calais with his wife and three daughters for hours.\"The first two-and-a-half hours weren't too bad but the girls have got restless in the last half an hour so we've let them run around the boarding carriage to burn off some energy,\" he said.\"Some people are getting angry but there's nothing that can be done, others are sleeping in their cars. We have used up our snacks and now have no plan B or C.\"BBC / Nicky SchillerServices between London and France, Belgium and the Netherlands have been hitNational Rail has advised passengers not to come to London St Pancras International if their Eurostar train is cancelled, while the Department for Transport said disruption is \"likely for the remainder of the day\" while faulty overhead cables are repaired. A photograph shared with the BBC by a train driver for Eurostar appears to show overhead electrical cables strewn across the tracks.Currently only one of two main tunnels in the Channel Tunnel is available for trains to run on, Eurostar said.Eurostar's services resumed with the 15:04 train from London to Brussels departing after 16:00. As of 18:00, only a few services to Paris Gare du Nord and Brussels were scheduled to depart London St Pancras International this evening. PA MediaCars and coaches were queued up outside the Channel Tunnel terminal in FolkestoneThe broken down LeShuttle train was also moved out of the Channel Tunnel. The operator said none of its passengers were stranded inside the tunnel after the power failure caused its closure. LeShuttle has apologised and warned of delays of approximately five hours, telling passengers to \"please check in as planned\". The LeShuttle service \"resumed very gradually on one track\" shortly before 15:00 local time (14:00 GMT), the EuroTunnel Press Office said.\"Service is operating alternately in both directions with significant delays,\" it said, adding that \"additional shuttles will be added in the evening and until tomorrow morning\". Traffic has also eased on the M20 after cars hoping to cross the Channel Tunnel caused traffic jams near the LeShuttle Terminal in Folkestone. ",

    "body": "2 days agoYvette TanGetty ImagesThe Thai army said more than 250 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were detected flying from the Cambodian sideThailand's army has accused Cambodia of breaching a newly signed ceasefire deal reached after weeks of deadly clashes that forced nearly one million people from their homes. In a statement, the Thai army said more than 250 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were detected flying from the Cambodian side on Sunday night.The ceasefire took effect at noon local time (05:00 GMT) on Saturday. Both sides agreed to freeze the front lines where they are now, ban reinforcements and allow civilians living in border areas to return as soon as possible.It had been seen as a breakthrough, which came after days of talks between both countries, with diplomatic encouragement from China and the US. In a statement on Monday, the Royal Thai Army said Cambodia's actions \"constitute provocation and a violation of measures aimed at reducing tensions\", adding that they were \"inconsistent\" with the terms of the ceasefire.It also said it \"may need to reconsider\" the release of 18 Cambodian soldiers held in Thailand since July. Thailand would be \"obliged to act in accordance... [if] violations of agreements and national sovereignty continue\", it added.Cambodian Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn described the incident as \"a small issue related to flying drones seen by both sides along the border line,\" according to AFP news agency. It comes just hours after China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi praised the \"hard-won\" ceasefire, and US President Donald Trump praised the \"rapid and fair conclusion\".The dispute between Thailand and Cambodia is not new, dating back more than a century.The latest tensions ramped up earlier this year, after a group of Cambodian women sang patriotic songs in a disputed temple.A Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash in May. This plunged relations between the countries to their lowest point in more than a decade.There were five days of intense fighting along the border, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead. Thousands more civilians were displaced.A fragile ceasefire deal was agreed in July and signed in October. It then collapsed earlier this month, when fresh clashes erupted. Both sides blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce.",

    "body": "2 days agoVitaliy ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC MonitoringThe much-anticipated talks lasted two-and-a-half hours, and that's an achievement in itself. Presidents Trump and Zelensky had never before spent this long in one room, negotiating.Afterwards, optimism was much on display at Mar-a-Lago. It was a \"terrific meeting\", according to Donald Trump. Volodymyr Zelensky agreed, describing it as a \"great meeting\" with \"great discussions on all the topics\".But even if the two presidents sounded more upbeat than before, yet again we did not hear any evidence of progress - just like after all the previous talks held this year.Trump says progress made in Ukraine talks but 'thorny issues' remainThere is still no answer to the key question of whether Ukraine will have to give up territory in exchange for a promise of peace. This is one of the main demands put forward by Russia and apparently backed by the US, so the fact that Zelensky has not accepted it - at least not in public - counts as good news for Ukraine. He did appear to leave the possibility of territorial concessions open, however, by saying that a referendum may be held to approve any deals to end the war.There is also no clarity on another crucial issue: security guarantees. Even though President Zelensky says they were \"100%\" agreed with the US, we do not know what they are and whether they would be enough to deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again.No less importantly, regardless of what agreements presidents Trump and Zelensky may have reached, there is no reason to assume that Russia would accept them. In fact, it has already rejected key ideas floated immediately before the talks in Florida: that a ceasefire be declared and a multinational force be deployed to Ukraine to monitor it.And this begs the question of what Donald Trump is prepared to do should Russia reject his agreements with Volodymyr Zelensky. So far, it has been the Ukrainian leader who has borne the brunt of his pressure, irritation and anger. Donald Trump's continuing positive rhetoric about Vladimir Putin (who, the US president said today, is \"serious\" about peace and \"wants to see Ukraine succeed\") suggests that this is unlikely to change.At the end of the day, all this means that despite Donald Trump's and Volodymyr Zelensky's optimism, we've seen little indication that lasting peace will prevail in Ukraine any time soon.",

    "body": "Brazil's jailed former president, Jair Bolsonaro, has undergone a third medical procedure over four days to treat persistent hiccups. Doctors performed a third operation to block his phrenic nerve. The nerve is found in the neck and vital in controlling the diaphragm – which controls breathing.The former president's wife, Michelle Bolsonaro, shared a statement on social media confirming her husband underwent a third procedure because the hiccups \"had not stopped' since the weekend.The far-right leader is serving a 27-year sentence after plotting a coup to overturn the 2022 election.Bolsonaro's medical team said he would undergo further testing on Wednesday to determine where he had gastroesphageal reflux. This occurs when stomach acid flows back up into the throat and causes heartburn.The two hiccup operations on Saturday and Monday treated Bolsonaro's right and left phrenic nerves. Doctors said on Tuesday they did not \"believe the hospitalisation will be prolonged much longer\".His wife, Michelle, said the ex-president's surgeries follow \"nine months of struggle and anguish with daily hiccups\".Bolsonaro, 70, was originally admitted to hospital in the capital, Brasília, to undergo a successful double hernia surgery on Christmas Day. He was due to leave hospital on 1 January if his recovery went well. Brazil's Supreme Court allowed the jailed ex-president to be transferred from police headquarters where he is serving his sentence to hospital.Prior to his hernia surgery, the former president underwent intestinal surgery in April.Bolsonaro served as president of Brazil between 2019 and 2023. He lost the 2022 election to Brazil's current president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.A man stabbed Bolsonaro in his abdomen at a campaign rally one month before the 2018 election, requiring surgery due to extensive blood loss. The stabbing has led to ongoing health issues for the far-right figure.He endorsed his son Flávio Bolsonaro to run against Lula in the 2026 presidential election.",

    "body": "1 day agoNavin Singh KhadkaEnvironment correspondent, BBC World ServiceDavid LianoOfficials say the problem of waste piling up is more evident on higher camps of EverestA scheme to encourage climbers to bring their waste down from Mount Everest is being scrapped - with Nepalese authorities telling the BBC it has been a failure.Climbers had been required to pay a deposit of $4,000 (£2964), which they would only get back if they brought at least 8kg (18lbs) of waste back down with them.It was hoped it would begin to tackle the rubbish problem on the world's highest peak, which is estimated to be covered in some 50 tonnes of waste.But after 11 years - and with the rubbish still piling up  - the scheme is being shelved because it \"failed to show a tangible result\".David LianoClean-up campaigns have usually focused on lower camps of Mt Everest as it is difficult and costly to operate at higher altitudes Himal Gautam, director at the tourism department, told the BBC that not only had the garbage issue \"not gone away\", but the deposit scheme itself had \"become an administrative burden\".Tourism ministry and mountaineering department officials told the BBC most of the deposit money had been refunded over the years - which should mean most climbers brought back their trash.But the scheme is said to have failed because the rubbish climbers have brought back is usually from lower camps - not the higher camps where the garbage problem is worst. \"From higher camps, people tend to bring back oxygen bottles only,\" said Tshering Sherpa, chief executive officer of the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee, which runs an Everest checkpoint. \"Other things like tents and cans and boxes of packed foods and drinks are mostly left behind there, that is why we can see so much of waste piling up.\"Mr Sherpa said on average a climber produces up to 12kg (26lbs) of waste on the mountain where they spend up to six weeks for acclimatisation and climbing.Apart from the \"flawed rule\" that required climbers to bring back less trash than they produce, authorities in the Everest region said lack of monitoring has been the main challenge.\"Apart from the check point above the Khumbu Icefall, there is no monitoring of what climbers are doing,\" said Mr Sherpa. Nepalese authorities are hoping a new scheme will be more effective.Getty ImagesEven the lower parts of the Everest region below the base camp see abandoned waste by visitors and trekkersUnder the changed rule, officials said, a non-refundable clean-up fee from climbers will be used to set up a checkpoint at Camp Two and also deploy mountain rangers who will keep going to the higher parts of the mountain to make sure climbers bring down their trash.Tourism ministry officials said it will most probably be $4,000 per climber - the same amount as deposit money - and will come into effect once passed by the parliament. Mingma Sherpa, chairperson of the Pasang Lhamu rural municipality, said the change was something the Sherpa community had lobbied for for many years now.\"We had been questioning the effectiveness of the deposit scheme all this time because we are not aware of anyone who was penalised for not bringing their trash down.\"And there was no designated fund but now this non-refundable fee will lead to creation of a fund that can enable us to do all these clean-up and monitoring works.\"Getty ImagesIncreasing number of climbers on Mount Everest has been a growing concern for sustainable mountaineering The non-refundable fee will form part of a recently introduced five-year mountain clean-up action plan, with Jaynarayan Acarya, spokesperson at the ministry of tourism, saying it was designed \"to immediately address the pressing problem of waste on our mountains\".Although there has been no study quantifying the waste on Everest, it is estimated there are tons of it including human excrement which does not decay on the higher part of the mountain because of freezing temperature.And the growing number of climbers each year, averaging around 400 with many more supporting staff, has been a growing concern for mountaineering sustainability.",

    "body": "23 hours agoKelly NgandMir Sabbir,Editor, BBC News BanglaKhaleda Zia, Bangladesh's first female prime minister and an arch-rival of ousted leader Sheikh Hasina, has died from a prolonged illness. She was 80 years old. Zia intended to run for parliament in February, when the country will vote for the first time since a popular revolution in late 2024 unseated Hasina.Thrust into the political limelight following the assassination of her husband, then-president Ziaur Rahman, she went on to become Bangladesh's first female PM in 1991. Her career, which included spells in prison and house arrest, was defined by a bitter feud with Hasina. She was acquitted of corruption and allowed to travel to London for treatment only after Hasina lost power. Physicians said on Monday that Zia's condition was \"extremely critical\". She was put on life support, but it was not possible to provide multiple treatments at the same time given her age and overall poor health, they added. \"Our favourite leader is no longer with us. She left us at 6am this morning,\" Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) announced on Facebook on Tuesday. When news of her death broke, crowds gathered outside Evercare Hospital in Dhaka where Zia had been admitted. As the wife of Bangladesh's former president Rahman, Zia was a reserved presence alongside her famous husband. When he was killed in a military coup in 1981, Zia entered politics and went on to lead the BNP in the country's first elections in 20 years.Known as an \"uncompromising leader\" after refusing to take part in a controversial election under military ruler General Hussain Muhammad Ershad in the 1980s, Zia broke through a male-dominated political landscape and transformed into one of Bangladesh's most formidable political leaders.Her first term was widely praised for efforts to improve women's education and social development, with her government bringing back parliamentary democracy by amending the constitution with bipartisan support.Her second term in 1996, which lasted only weeks, drew criticism for staging a one-sided election despite opposition demands for a neutral caretaker authority — a measure parliament approved before dissolving.Zia returned as prime minister in 2001, stepping down in October 2006 ahead of a general election. Her administration faced sharp criticism over allegations of corruption.Over the past 16 years, under the Awami League government, Zia became the most prominent symbol of resistance to Hasina's rule many saw as increasingly autocratic. She boycotted the 2014 election after her rival Hasina scrapped the caretaker government system — a provision meant to ensure neutrality during national polls. Later, Zia was convicted on corruption charges and jailed. She denied wrongdoing and said the charges were politically motivated.She was released in January 2025, soon after mass anti-government protests in Bangladesh toppled Hasina, forcing her into exile in India. She has since been convicted and sentenced to death for crimes against humanity over her crackdown of the protests.The BNP had said in November that Zia would campaign in the upcoming general elections. The party is eyeing a return to power, and if that happens, Zia's son Tarique Rahman is expected to become the country's new leader.Rahman, 60, had only returned to Bangladesh last week after 17 years in self-imposed exile in London.Zia had been in hospital for the past month, receiving treatment for kidney damage, heart disease and pneumonia, among other conditions.Despite being kept away from public life due to her health, Zia remained a figurehead for opposition forces.During her final days, interim leader Muhammad Yunus had called for the country to pray for Zia, calling her a \"source of utmost inspiration for the nation\".In a statement on Tuesday, Yunus offered his condolences for the passing of Zia, whom he described as a \"symbol of the democratic movement\".\"The nation has lost a great guardian... Her role in the struggle to establish democracy, a multi-party political culture, and the rights of the people in Bangladesh will be remembered forever,\" he said in a statement.Hasina's party, the Awami League, now banned in Bangladesh, issued a statement from Hasina on X paying tribute to Zia.Hasina, who is still in India, said in her statement that Zia's \"contributions to the nation were significant and will be remembered\", and her passing was a \"profound loss for Bangladesh's political life\". India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he is \"deeply saddened\" by Zia's passing and paid tribute to her contributions towards the development of Bangladesh, and its relations with India. \"We hope that her vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership,\" he wrote on X.Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called Zia \"a committed friend of Pakistan\", whose service to Bangladesh would leave a lasting legacy.Zia's family members, including Rahman, his wife and his daughter, were by her side in her last moments, BNP said.\"We pray for the forgiveness of her soul and request everyone to offer prayers for her departed soul,\" the party said in its statement on Tuesday.Additional reporting by Fan Wang",

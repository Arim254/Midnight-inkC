    "body": "<div><p>Families of Israelis held hostage in Gaza have told the BBC they are hopeful that US President Donald Trump's plan for ending the war will bring their loved ones home.</p><p>Viki Cohen, whose son Nimrod is among 20 hostages held in Gaza who are still believed to be alive, said she had woken on Saturday with a sense of \"hope and expectation\", but also \"fear that something will go wrong\".</p><p>\"It is a fragile situation and we don't want to be disappointed again. And yet I feel hope that soon I will see Nimrod and I can hug [him] again.\"</p><p>Nimrod, now aged 21, was a 19-year-old soldier when he was kidnapped by Hamas near the Gaza border in the 7 October 2023 attacks. In total, 251 people were taken hostage that day, and some 1,200 others were killed.</p><p>On Friday, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdxq7zp7002o\">Hamas agreed to release all the remaining Israeli hostages</a> - living and dead - but said it wanted further negotiations on a number of key points outlined in the US peace plan.</p><p>After Hamas submitted its response, Trump posted on Truth Social \"I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE\", as he called on Israel to \"immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly!\"</p><p>In a response overnight, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was \"preparing to immediately implement the first phase of Trump's plan for the immediate release of all hostages\".</p><p>Negotiations between Israel and Hamas are now expected to resume in Egypt in the coming days.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c15k199j1x3o\">Shock in Gaza as Trump appears to welcome Hamas response to US peace plan</a></li></ul></div><div><p>On Saturday evening, tens of thousands of people gathered in Tel Aviv in support of the deal to end the war.</p><p>Crowds in Hostages Square broke out into chants of \"you're not alone, we're with you\" as families of the hostages took to the stage to call for their return.</p><p>\"Netanyahu, don't take our oxygen and our hope,\" Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is being held captive in Gaza, screamed into the microphone.</p><p>\"To you they're just hostages, but to me that's my boy. He's my life. The hostages are the beating heart of the country.\"</p><p>Liran Berman demanded the return of his brothers Gali and Ziv.</p><p>\"With hope comes fear - will the deal be signed? Will I ever see my brothers again?\" he said. \"We cannot let another deal collapse. Not again… it is now or never.\"</p><p>Former hostage Omer Shem Tov, who was abducted from the Nova festival, led chants of \"bring them home\".</p><p>He appealed directly to Trump to make sure his deal was enforced.</p><p>\"We have to make sure this deal happens. We have to make sure Hamas signs it. It's been two years. The world is watching,\" he told the cheering crowd.</p><p>As the families and former hostages spoke to the crowd in Tel Aviv, Netanyahu gave a televised address to the nation, saying he hoped to announce the release of the hostages being held in Gaza \"in the coming days\".</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c70155nked7o\">Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan</a></li></ul><p>Earlier on Saturday, Udi Goren, whose cousin Tal Haimi was killed in the 7 October attacks and his body taken to Gaza where it remains, said he was optimistic that a deal would be reached.</p><p>\"We're seeing President Trump putting his foot down and getting everybody behind him, including the Arab countries and the Israeli prime minister,\" he said.</p><p>\"We need to make sure that there's a better future for Israelis and Palestinians. Now is the time for action, not for words.\"</p><p>His views were echoed by other hostage families.</p><p>In a statement, the family of Eitan Horn said that for \"the first time in so many long and painful months, our hearts dare to believe that the release of Eitan - and of all 47 hostages [living and dead] - may finally be near. That soon, they will come home\".</p><p>But, they added: \"Our hope is tempered by great fear.\"</p><p>\"Until they return, they remain starved, tortured and in constant danger of death.\"</p><p>Gil Dickman told the BBC he knew too well what it meant to miss a chance for a ceasefire deal.</p><p>His cousin Carmel Gat was taken hostage from Kibbutz Be'eri and her body recovered from a tunnel in Gaza almost a year later. The Israeli military said she and five other hostages had been killed shortly before its troops reached them.</p><p>\"What we saw yesterday is that Hamas gave an answer - they had some agreements with Trump's plan and some disagreements, but the main thing for me is that they're willing to go through with this,\" he said.</p><p>\"We've had so many other chances before that were missed\" but this is a \"very, very important stage in the process… and maybe gets us close to getting this war over with\".</p></div>"

I don't want to leave Morocco, and I don't want to resent my country for choosing to stay,\" says Hajar Belhassan, a 25-year-old communications manager from Settat, 80km (50 miles) south of Casablanca.</p><p>A group called Gen Z 212 - the number is a reference to the country's international dialling code - has been coordinating the demonstrations through the gaming and streaming platform Discord, as well as TikTok and Instagram.</p><p>Apparently taking inspiration from Nepal's recent Gen Z protests, the young Moroccans want the authorities to act with the same urgency and passion when it comes to addressing these issues as with hosting one of the world's premier sporting events.</p><p>Starting on 27 September with protests across 10 cities, the crowds have been building through the week, chanting slogans such as: \"No World Cup, health comes first\" and \"We want hospitals not football stadiums\".</p><p>The police have responded with seemingly arbitrary mass arrests and in certain places things have turned violent, leading to the death of three protesters.</p><p>Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch said on Thursday that he was open to dialogue, but the leaderless movement has vowed to keep going until there is concrete change.</p><p>A list of their demands has been shared on social media. They include:</p><ul><li>Free and quality education for all</li><li>Accessible public healthcare for everyone</li><li>Decent and affordable housing</li><li>Better public transport</li><li>Lower prices and subsidise basic goods</li><li>Improve wages and pensions</li><li>Provide job opportunities for youth and reduce unemployment</li><li>Adopt English as the second language instead of French (after Arabic)</li></ul><p>Anger had been growing, but what galvanised the movement was the death over a number of days in mid-September of eight women in a maternity ward of a hospital in the southern city of Agadir. There were some reports that the deaths could have been prevented if there had been better care, proper equipment and enough medical staff.</p><p>In 2023, it was estimated that there were 7.8 doctors per 10,000 Moroccans, way below the World Health Organization recommendation of 23 per 10,000.</p><p>Having read about the protests on social media and inspired by a friend, Ms Belhassan decided to join on Monday.</p><p>The day before, that friend had been sending her videos from a demonstration in Casablanca that she was taking part in and Ms Belhassan was immediately uploading them onto her social media accounts.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7107/live/42cd5e00-a06d-11f0-9640-9757c7912ee3.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7107/live/42cd5e00-a06d-11f0-9640-9757c7912ee3.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7107/live/42cd5e00-a06d-11f0-9640-9757c7912ee3.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7107/live/42cd5e00-a06d-11f0-9640-9757c7912ee3.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7107/live/42cd5e00-a06d-11f0-9640-9757c7912ee3.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7107/live/42cd5e00-a06d-11f0-9640-9757c7912ee3.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7107/live/42cd5e00-a06d-11f0-9640-9757c7912ee3.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7107/live/42cd5e00-a06d-11f0-9640-9757c7912ee3.jpg.webp\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images A woman is arrested by police officers, who are surrounding her.

A 2004 commission appointed by the king to investigate the country's past human rights abuses verified 114 deaths but did not disclose how exactly they died. Reparations were then made to victims of human rights abuses and families of deceased ones.</p><p>The country has seen other youth-led movements, notably in 2011 and 2016.</p><p>The events of 2011 were part of the larger Arab Spring and led to reform of the constitution through a national referendum called by King Mohamed VI. </p><p>For the first time in Moroccan history, the monarch strengthened the role of the government by ceding executive power to the prime minister and parliament. The king remains the legitimate head of state, military and religious affairs, holding the power to appoint and remove ministers if necessary.</p><p>What makes Gen Z 212 different is that those demonstrating say they are not tied to a political party and do not appear to have a formal structure.</p><p>\"We are not a political movement. We have no leader,\" Ms Belhassan says.</p><p>\"Maybe that's why the police were arresting people, and why the government kept silent – because, in their eyes, we didn't follow the traditional path of organisations and political parties.\"</p><p>But there is some disquiet about the violence.</p><p>On the night of 1 October, three protesters died in the town of Lqliaa after people attempted to storm a police station. The local authorities said security forces opened fire after protesters tried to start a fire and steal weapons from the station, then subsequently released supporting CCTV footage to disprove emerging false narratives online.</p><p>Protesters have condemned the rioting and looting that have happened in certain areas and have organised clean-up groups. They have also repeatedly called for peace and dialogue, but it seems they are not convinced by the prime minister's apparent willingness to talk.</p><p>On Friday, calls began to emerge for the king to dissolve the government. That may be a step too far, but the protesters do not seem to be in the mood to pull back.</p><p>Looking ahead to 2030, protester Ms Belhassan says that \"of course\" Moroccans are \"excited to host the World Cup\".</p><p>\"We love football, it is in our blood. But we are missing the foundations. Sure, let's build stadiums, but let's also build our education and health systems. Let's take care of our people.\"</p></div><p></p><h2>More about Gen Z protests around the world:</h2><p></p><div><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz082y8j3jzo\">Behind the Gen Z protesters who want to force Madagascar's president from power</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn4ljv39em7o\">The Gen Z uprising in Asia shows social media is a double-edged sword</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg9n760gddo\">Politicians get rich while we suffer - so I helped bring down our government in 48 hours</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y5j98p4pjo\">Madagascar police fire tear gas as president fails to placate protesters</a></li></ul></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" /><span>Getty Images/BBC</span></p></div></figure><div><p><span>BBC Africa podcasts</span></p></div></article>"

That means that, even if global temperatures stabilised tomorrow, glaciers would continue to retreat.</p><p>\"A large part of the future melt of the glaciers is already locked in,\" explains Prof Marzeion. \"They are lagging climate change.\"</p></div><div><p>But all is not lost.</p><p>Half of the ice remaining across the world's mountain glaciers could be preserved if <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-35073297\">global warming is limited to 1.5C</a> above \"pre-industrial\" levels of the late 1800s, according to research published this year in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu4675\">the journal Science</a>.</p><p>Our current trajectory is leading us towards warming of about 2.7C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century – which would see three-quarters of ice lost eventually.</p><p>That extra water going into rivers and eventually the oceans means higher sea levels for coastal populations around the world.</p><p>But the loss of ice will be particularly acutely felt by mountain communities dependent on glaciers for fresh water.</p><p>Glaciers are a bit like giant reservoirs. They collect water as snowfall - which turns into ice - during cold, wet periods, and release it as meltwater during warm periods.</p><p>This meltwater helps to stabilise river flows during hot, dry summers - until the glacier disappears.</p><p>The loss of that water resource has knock-on effects for all those who rely on glaciers - for irrigation, drinking, hydropower and even shipping traffic.</p><p>Switzerland is not immune from those challenges, but the implications are much more profound for the high mountains of Asia, referred to by some as the Third Pole due to the volume of ice.</p><p>About 800 million people rely at least partly on meltwater from glaciers there, particularly for agriculture. That includes the upper Indus river basin, which serves parts of China, India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.</p><p>In regions with drier summers, meltwater from ice and snow can be the only significant source of water for months.</p><p>\"That's where we see the biggest vulnerability,\" says Prof Hock.</p><p>So how do scientists feel when confronted by the future prospects of glaciers in a warming world?</p><p>\"It's sad,\" says Prof Hock. \"But at the same time, it's also empowering. If you decarbonise and reduce the [carbon] footprint, you can preserve glaciers.</p><p>\"We have it in our hands.\"</p></div><div><p><i>Top image: Tschierva Glacier, Swiss Alps, in 1935 and 2022.

A former government minister, TV host and avid heavy metal drummer, she is one of the best-known figures in Japanese politics - and a controversial one at that.</p><p>She faces many challenges, including contending with a sluggish economy and households struggling with relentless inflation and stagnant wages. </p><p>She will also have to navigate a rocky US-Japan relationship and see through a tariff deal with the Trump administration agreed by the previous government.</p></div><div><p>If confirmed as prime minister, one of Takaichi's key challenges will be uniting the party after a turbulent few years which saw it rocked by scandals and internal conflicts. </p><p>Last month, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, whose term lasted just over a year, announced he would step down after a series of election defeats that saw the  Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) governing coalition lose its majority in both chambers of parliament.</p><p>Prof Jeff Kingston, director of Asian Studies at Temple University in Tokyo, told the BBC that Takaichi was unlikely to have \"much success at healing the internal party rift\".</p><p>Takaichi belongs to the \"hardline\" faction of the LDP, which believed that \"the reason the LDP support has imploded is because it lost touch with its right-wing DNA\", he added.</p><p>\"I think she's in a good position to regain the right wing voters, but at the expense of wider popular appeal, if they go into a national election.\"</p><p>Takaichi has been a long-time admirer of Britain's first female prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. She is now ever closer to fulfilling her Iron Lady ambition. </p><p>But many women voters don't see her as an advocate for progress. </p><p>\"She calls herself Japan's Margaret Thatcher. In terms of fiscal discipline, she's anything but Thatcher,\" Prof Kingston said.</p><p>\"But like Thatcher she's not much of a healer. I don't think she's done much to empower women.\"</p><p>Takaichi is a staunch conservative who's long opposed legislation allowing women to keep their maiden names after marriage, saying it is against tradition. She is also against same sex marriage. </p><p>A protégé of the late former leader Shinzo Abe, Takaichi has vowed to bring back his economic vision, known as Abenomics – which involves high fiscal spending and cheap borrowing. </p><p>The LDP veteran is hawkish on security and aims to revise Japan's pacifist constitution. </p><p>She's also a regular visitor of the controversial Yasukuni shrine where Japan's war dead including some convicted war criminals are memorialised.</p><p>She will likely be confirmed by parliament, although not automatically like her predecessors because the ruling party is in a much weaker position now having lost its majority in both houses.</p></div>"

The two already sit in the same European Parliament group – the \"pro-sovereignty\" Patriots for Europe, which Babis founded alongside Hungary's Viktor Orban and Austria's Herbert Kickl last year.</p><p>ANO shares the Motorists' misgivings about the EU's emissions targets, and vows to modify or reject them outright.</p><p>Both parties are firmly against Czech households carrying a greater financial burden for cleaner energy, and both oppose the EU's ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars after 2035.</p><p>Relations with the SPD could be more fraught.</p><p>For a start, SPD fought this election in a formal alliance with a number of fringe parties on the far-right, meaning they will have to yield some of their seats to them. Okamura may not have full control of the MPs in his caucus – always a recipe for disaster in coalition politics.</p><p>Babis has also categorically ruled out allowing a referendum on either EU or NATO membership – a key policy priority for the SPD.</p><p>The ANO leader might have leaned heavily into anti-Ukrainian rhetoric in the final days of the campaign, lambasting the centre-right government for giving \"Czech mothers nothing, and Ukrainians everything\".</p><p>But Okamura's call for Ukrainian refugees to be deported en masse will likely fall on deaf ears.</p><p>Czech military support for Ukraine's war effort however is likely to change significantly under a Babis administration.</p></div><div><p>He has already vowed to scrap the successful Czech ammunition initiative – which has delivered 3.5 million shells to Ukraine since 2022.</p><p>Babis claims it lacks transparency, but Czech government officials who created the scheme say it works precisely because it is not transparent.</p><p>Under the initiative, Czech arms dealers use their international contacts to procure shells for Ukraine on the global market, with the bulk of the money coming from EU and NATO partners. Some of the producers are in countries that have relationships with Russia but as the deal is arranged with Czech dealers their involvement remains private.</p><p>The ANO leader wants it moved under the umbrella of NATO instead, and again on Saturday accused Czech arms dealers of making enormous profits from the scheme.</p><p>However, he said he would have no problem negotiating the matter with President Zelensky.</p><p>Babis also laughed off claims Western allies were worried the Czech Republic would no longer be a reliable partner in the EU and NATO under his administration, and that was why he now appeared to be distancing himself from extremist parties.</p><p>\"Your problem is you just copy lies from Czech journalists,\" he replied, answering a reporter from the New York Times in English.</p><p>\"I spoke with Trump five times! I was in the Pentagon. I was in the FBI. I talked to the head of the CIA,\" Babis said, speaking of his first term, which overlapped with President Trump's first term in office.</p><p>\"We were a very reliable partner,\" he went on.</p><p>\"I have been prime minister. We have been in government before. And we had excellent results.\"</p></div></article>"

Unlike many who served with Trump during those first four years, Vought had staying power - and was quickly reinstalled as head of the budget office when Trump returned this year.</p><p>\"A lot of those who didn't come back represent an old way of thinking,\" said Richard Stern, a Heritage economic policy director who, like Vought, began his career in conservative congressional budget circles. \"Russ was ahead of his time in the first term and right on time now.\"</p><p>Although Vought isn't one to shy away from controversial statements – he once said that he aspired to be \"the person who crushes the deep state\" – he doesn't exactly look the part of a Republican bogeyman.</p><p>Balding and bespectacled, with a greying beard, Vought's public statements typically have the measured cadence of a bean-counter or professor. He lacks the narrow-eyed glower and amped-up rhetoric of Stephen Miller, another longtime Trump adviser who oversees White House immigration policy.</p><p>Make no mistake, however, Vought has become an influential player in this White House, having turned the Office of Management and Budget – usually referred to by its acronym OMB - into the principal engine behind Trump's push to slash government spending and its workforce.</p></div><div><p>Earlier in the year he worked closely with Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or \"Doge\", as they cut a scorched-earth path through the federal government, shuttering multiple agencies and downsizing entire departments. And he carried on the efforts after Musk departed and Doge largely dropped out of public view.</p><p>\"OMB is an intrinsically powerful position, but it has almost never been wielded as such,\" Stern said. \"Its people have tended to caretake and allow the bureaucracy to slowly grow. It is as influential as the person who wields that chair wants to make it.\"</p></div><p></p><h2>Seizing opportunity in shutdown</h2><p></p><div><p>Now Trump has threatened to unleash Vought at a time when, because of the legal limbo created by the government shutdown, their cuts might be deeper and more durable than those instituted earlier this year by Doge.</p><p>Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a veteran of the big shutdown fights of the 1990s, told NPR that Vought and his team have been preparing for exactly these kind of circumstances while they were in the political wilderness during the Biden years.</p><p>\"They all knew a government shutdown was possible,\" he said. \"I think they had decided early on that you're only going to get the scale of change they want if you're very tough and very determined and every chance you get, you take the opportunity.\"</p><p>The opportunity this shutdown presents for budget-cutters like Vought is that, without congressionally approved funding, the government is operating in a legal grey area with fewer budgetary restrictions. </p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdr6pnky7vyo\">Four ways the US government shutdown could end</a></li></ul><p>The White House can, in theory, slash funding and staffing deeper than it could earlier in the year, when spending was governed by baseline appropriation amounts. And while permanent layoffs would still have to abide by a 60-day notice, Vought could start that clock ticking whenever he, and Trump, so choose.</p><p>Vought already has announced major infrastructure projects in New York City and Chicago are on hold, citing the need for a review of potentially illegal racial hiring practices - a review that he said can't take place during the shutdown. He's also cancelled nearly $8bn in clean energy projects across 16 states, all of which backed Harris, Trump's opponent, in last year's presidential race.</p><p>Democrats and federal worker unions have promised to fight these reductions in court and claimed that Trump is making largely empty threats to try to pressure them into abandoning the fight.</p></div><div><p>Many economists have pointed out that the White House reductions have been accompanied by other deficit-ballooning policies, which could undercut their attacks on Democrats for being the party of fiscal irresponsibility.</p><p>\"Republicans are increasing spending in other areas and cutting taxes at the same time,\" Brett House, an economics professor at the Columbia University School of Business noted. \"The notion that they're devoted to fiscal prudence is not borne out by their actions.\"</p><p>Some Republicans in Congress have expressed concern that the apparent glee with which Trump is touting Vought-ordered cuts could turn public opinion against them if the shutdown stretches on.</p><p>Republicans have been warning of the dire consequences of the shutdown on government services - part of a concerted effort to portray Democrats as the ones to blame. Doing so while celebrating the new ways the administration is slashing programmes could derail those efforts.</p><p>\"Russ is less politically in tune than the president,\" South Dakota Senator Kevin Cramer, a member of the \"Doge caucus\", told the news website Semafor. </p><p>\"We, as Republicans, have never had so much moral high ground on a government funding bill in our lives… I just don't see why we would squander it, which I think is the risk of being aggressive with executive power in this moment.\"</p><p>Thom Tills, a North Carolina senator who has chosen not to run for re-election next year, warns that administration officials \"need to be really careful\" in how they present any new cuts.</p><p>The Doge-directed layoffs and programme cuts were largely unpopular, according to public-opinion surveys, causing a drag on the president's approval ratings. A reprise of that now could be perilous.</p><p>According to Stern, however, the White House, and Vought, may view the long-term benefits as well worth the short-term challenges.</p><p>\"For Russ, for myself, for anybody who's in the budget space, this country is going bankrupt,\" he said. \"Whatever the political risks of trying to do the right thing, we have to do it. If we do nothing, this country will implode.\"</p></div></article>"

So sharks can go over, under and around them.</p><p>\"It's like throwing a napkin into the pool,\" University of Sydney Professor Chris Pepin-Neff told the BBC.</p><p>The state government says shark nets are \"not designed to create a total barrier between bathers and sharks\" but rather aim to \"intercept target sharks\" during any hunts which bring them close to the shore.</p><p>But researchers like Prof Pepin-Neff say the nets aren't very effective, and give the illusion of safety rather than delivering a real reduction in risk.</p><p>They note that 40% of sharks caught in the nets are actually found on the beach side trying to get out.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/cae0/live/530354d0-a015-11f0-b5f0-25b961cb80b7.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/cae0/live/530354d0-a015-11f0-b5f0-25b961cb80b7.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cae0/live/530354d0-a015-11f0-b5f0-25b961cb80b7.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/cae0/live/530354d0-a015-11f0-b5f0-25b961cb80b7.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/cae0/live/530354d0-a015-11f0-b5f0-25b961cb80b7.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/cae0/live/530354d0-a015-11f0-b5f0-25b961cb80b7.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/cae0/live/530354d0-a015-11f0-b5f0-25b961cb80b7.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cae0/live/530354d0-a015-11f0-b5f0-25b961cb80b7.jpg.webp\" alt=\"A man with grey hair and a grey beard looks at the camera.

Nets along the east coast also routinely entangle humpback whales on their annual migration to and from the tropics.</p><p>\"They will capture dolphins, turtles, fish, stingrays… and if they're an air-breathing mammal or reptile, it's a death sentence [unless they're freed in time],\" Mr Cropp says.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/cf10/live/3e2cf850-a014-11f0-b5f0-25b961cb80b7.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/cf10/live/3e2cf850-a014-11f0-b5f0-25b961cb80b7.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cf10/live/3e2cf850-a014-11f0-b5f0-25b961cb80b7.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/cf10/live/3e2cf850-a014-11f0-b5f0-25b961cb80b7.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/cf10/live/3e2cf850-a014-11f0-b5f0-25b961cb80b7.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/cf10/live/3e2cf850-a014-11f0-b5f0-25b961cb80b7.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/cf10/live/3e2cf850-a014-11f0-b5f0-25b961cb80b7.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cf10/live/3e2cf850-a014-11f0-b5f0-25b961cb80b7.png.webp\" alt=\"NSW Department of Primary Industries A great white shark, which is missing chunks of flesh, on a boat deck\" /><span>NSW Department of Primary Industries</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Photos of sharks retrieved from nets, missing chunks of flesh, have been released under freedom of information laws</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Prof Pepin-Neff believes there's a danger that animals which die in the nets actually attract sharks to the beach too.</p><p>\"When other fish get caught in those nets they sort of flail and it sends out a vibration underwater, sort of like ringing the dinner bell,\" says Prof Pepin-Neff.</p><p>Though the general public is wary of sharks, support for nets appears to be waning. </p><p>A poll conducted by Prof Pepin-Neff at Bondi Beach two years ago found three quarters of respondents would swim at the beach even if shark nets were taken out.

    "body": "2 days agoGeorge WrightGetty ImagesTens of thousands have taken to the streets of Portugal's capital, Lisbon, to protest against proposed labour laws which they say threaten workers' rights.The centre-right government wants to make it easier for employers to fire people,  outsource work to other companies, and limit some types of compassionate leave, including cutting bereavement leave for women who suffer miscarriages.It says the measures are needed to improve job flexibility and increase productivity in one of western Europe's poorest countries.The head of Portugal's largest union, CGTP, called the reforms \"one of the greatest attacks ever made against workers\" in the country and announced a general strike for 11 December.The bill is likely to pass in parliament with support from far-right party Chega.The union told Reuters that around 100,000 protesters filled Lisbon's main avenue, while the Associated Press also reported tens of thousands of people were present. No police estimate was available.Speaking at the protest, Miriam Alves, 31, a worker at a medical device company, told Reuters that reforms are \"clearly a step backward in working conditions and could lead to a complete lack of job security\".Archive technician Madalena Pena, 34, said the government was reversing labour rights \"in an unfair, subtle, and cunning way, without having said anything before the election\" in May.CGTP general secretary Tiago Oliveira announced the strike for next month at the protest.On the proposed changes, he said: \"If implemented, it would be a real setback in the lives of each and every one of us.\"Protesters also wanted higher wages. Official data shows more than 50% of workers earned less than 1,000 euros (£879) per month last year. The minimum wage is only 870 euros (£764).",

    "body": "2 days agoCBSMaria Florinda Rios Perez was fatally shot after arriving at the wrong home for a house-cleaning appointment US officials are looking into whether to file charges against an Indiana homeowner who shot and killed a house cleaner who mistakenly showed up at the wrong address.Police say they found Maria Florinda Rios Perez dead in her husband's arms on the front porch of a home on Wednesday shortly before 0700 local time (12:00 GMT). Authorities had been responding to a call about a possible home invasion in the Indianapolis suburb of Whitestown. The two did not appear to have entered the home, police said in a statement. They have formally submitted the case to the Boone County Prosecutor's Office for review to determine whether criminal charges will be brought in the case. Police have not identified the people in the home or who fired the shot, saying in a statement on Friday that it is a \"complex, delicate, and evolving case, and it would be both inappropriate and potentially dangerous to disclose that information\". They urged patience, warning of a \"concerning spread of misinformation online\" about the case.Mauricio Velazquez, told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that he wanted justice for his 32-year-old wife. News reports say that she was a mother of four and originally from Guatemala. In an interview with CBS affiliate WTTV, Mr Velazquez said the bullet came right through the door of the home. \"They should've called the police first instead of just shooting out of nowhere like that,\" he said through an interpreter.CBSMauricio Velazquez said the bullet that killed his wife came through the door of the home they went to early on WednesdayBoone County prosecutor Kent Eastwood told The Indianapolis Star that the case is complex due to the language of the state's stand-your-ground law.Stand-your-ground laws are in place in many US states and most permit an individual to protect themselves with the use of reasonable force, including deadly force, to prevent death or great bodily harm.Similar incidents have made headlines across the US in recent years. In 2023, Ralph Yarl, who was then 16, was shot twice after ringing the doorbell of the wrong home in Missouri. Andrew Lester, who was in his 80s, pleaded guilty and died while awaiting sentencing. In New York, 20-year-old Kaylin Gillis died after being shot upon entering the wrong driveway. The homeowner who shot her is now serving a 25-year sentence. ",

    "body": "Three people died and 15 more were injured after powerful waves battered popular Spanish holiday island Tenerife. A woman died after being pulled into the ocean near the Puerto de la Cruz resort and a man died at Santa Cruz de Tenerife, emergency services said on Sunday. A third man was found dead in the ocean near a beach in Granadilla.Emergency services have told the public to stay away from coastal paths and to avoid taking pictures and videos of the rough seas, as the turbulent weather continues. Rescue services said they airlifted a man who fell into water at La Guancha in the north of the island, but that he was later pronounced dead at hospital. They said another man died after he was found floating near a beach at El Cabezo in the south, with lifeguards and medical staff unable to resuscitate him. At Puerto de la Cruz, a holiday resort in northern Tenerife, one woman died of a heart attack and another 10 people were swept out to sea. Three of those were seriously injured and taken to hospital.A local waiter, who gave his name only as Pedro, told the Reuters news agency that he jumped into the water in an attempt to save people being swept out. \"As soon as I saw a man waving at me I took my clothes off, jumped to the water and I managed to grab three of them and save them. I couldn't save the woman because she passed away at that moment,\" he said. Eyewitness Carlos said he warned people taking photos to move away from the waves but \"they did not pay attention\".Officials say the Canary Islands, the Spanish archipelago Tenerife belongs to, are on alert for coastal hazards. They warned sea conditions are expected to worsen with swells reaching two-to-four metres, and tourists and locals should exercise \"extreme caution\".",

    "body": "Syrian President Ahmed Sharaa has arrived in Washington for an official visit, just two days after the US formally revoked his status as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. The former Islamist militant will meet US President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, 11 months after his rebel alliance ousted Bashar al-Assad.Hours before his arrival in the US capital it was announced that Syrian security services had detained dozens of suspected members of the so-called Islamic State group.Joint efforts to tackle what remains of the group in Syria are expected to be high on the agenda during Sharaa's talks with Trump.Syrian authorities said 71 suspected members of the group were arrested, with weapons and explosives also seized.Since taking power, Sharaa has looked to reestablish Syria's presence on the world stage after decades of isolation under the Assad regime and 13 years of civil war.He travelled to the US in September to address the UN General Assembly, where he said Syria was \"reclaiming its rightful place among the nations of the world\" and called on the international community to remove sanctions.Earlier this week the UN Security Council backed a US resolution to lift measures, which coincided with Washington continuing a months-long process of gradually easing sanctions on Syria and its new leaders.On Friday, Sharaa and his interior minister, Anas Hasan Khattab, were removed from a US register of individuals suspected of supporting or funding extremist groups, a decision the Treasury Department said was \"in recognition of the progress demonstrated by the Syrian leadership\".Sharaa had been listed under the name Muhammad al-Jawlani, the alias he used as leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The group was affiliated with al-Qaeda until 2016, when Sharaa severed ties.Prior to leading HTS, Sharaa fought for al-Qaeda in Iraq and was for a time imprisoned by US forces. He was also subject to an American bounty of $10 million.The US lifted its sanctions on HTS earlier this year.Trump previously met Sharaa in May during a visit to Riyadh, where he described him as a \"tough guy, very strong past\".Despite his background, Sharaa has drawn backing from governments that opposed the Assad regime by vowing to lead a moderate government which can win support from Syria's various ethnic groups and factions.Earlier this year, he vowed to root out elements of his security forces which were accused of executing members of Syria's Alawite minority. Deadly violence has also broken out in recent months between Sunni Bedouin tribal fighters and Druze militias, raising questions over whether the HTS-led government can restore stability to a country defined by war for more than a decade.

    "body": "In the three weeks since the Louvre museum heist, as investigators sought to find out who was behind it and why the French crown jewels had been so easy to steal, another mystery remained: who the \"fedora man\" was.The dapper youth in a hat was photographed outside the museum that Sunday and went viral on social media, prompting theories about his identity.Police moved swiftly to arrest and charge four people for the crime, while the Louvre director admitted CCTV security was inadequate.However, the fedora man remained an enigma - until now.The dandy, it turns out, is a local teenage fan of Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot who just happened to be at a real crime scene.Pedro Elias Garzon Delvaux, a 15-year-old from Rambouillet, south-west of Paris told the Associated Press (AP) news agency that he had planned to visit the Louvre with his family but found the museum was closed. \"We didn't know there was a heist,\" he said.As he asked officers about the closure, an AP photographer seeking to capture the security cordon took a picture and included Pedro in the frame.Pedro only realised the photo had gone viral four days later, when a friend sent him a screenshot asking: \"Is that you?\"When he replied that it was, the friend said he had five million views on TikTok. \"I was a bit surprised,\" Pedro told the AP.He was even more shocked when his mother called to say the picture had appeared in The New York Times. It made a big impact on him, he said, because he reads that newspaper and \"it's not every day you're in the New York Times\". \"People said, 'You've become a star'. I was astonished that just with one photo you can become viral in a few days.\"Asked why he wore an old-fashioned waistcoat and a fedora to the museum, Pedro said he began dressing this way recently, inspired by 20th-century statesmen and fictional detectives.\"I like to be chic,\" he told the AP. \"I go to school like this.\"As wild speculation about the photo of him circulated online - some wondered whether he might be a real detective or an AI fake - Pedro remained silent for weeks.\"I didn't want to say immediately it was me,\" he said. \"With this photo there is a mystery, so you have to make it last.\"",

    "body": "1 day agoOttilie Mitchell and Harry SekulichUS aviation authorities have ordered that all models of a cargo plane that crashed mid-takeoff in Kentucky on Tuesday be grounded.It comes after a Boeing MD-11 aircraft operated by UPS burst into flames on the runway of Louisville International Airport before colliding into neighbouring businesses, killing 14 people. The American delivery firm had earlier said it would not operate the planes pending an ongoing investigation, with FedEx then following suit.Now the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a formal notice banning all MD-11 and MD11F aircraft from flying until safety checks are carried out.In total, 70 models are in use with UPS, FedEx and Western Global Airlines.FAA officials said the Kentucky crash happened after the plane's left engine caught fire and detached from the wing during take-off. The aircraft was carrying 38,000 gallons (144,000 litres) of fuel as it took off for a flight to Hawaii, which contributed to the size of the fire after the crash.A total of 14 people were killed in the crash and subsequent fire, including one person who had been admitted to hospital, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg has said.He said the number of dead now matches the number of people who were reported missing, indicating officials do not expect the death toll to climb further.Boeing said it welcomed the directive and that it had already advised the three firms which use the model to stop operating it out of \"an abundance of caution\".It is unclear whether the order will impact delivery services in the US, with none of the three companies reporting disruption so far.Data collated by the live air traffic website FlightRadar24 showed 55 MD-11 planes were used over the past week. \"Contingency plans are in place to flex our integrated air and ground network to help protect time-sensitive, critical shipments such as lifesaving pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and other products move through our network without disruption,\" FedEx said in a statement.UPS also said contingency plans were in place to continue its service. A statement continued: \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.\"The final passenger flights using an MD-11 was in 2014, with the model used exclusively as a cargo carrier since.The model of aircraft involved in the crash was an MD-11F triple-engine plane, which first entered service 34 years ago with Thai Airways as a passenger jet, but was transferred to UPS in 2006.MD-11s were originally manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, before the company merged with Boeing in 1997. Production of MD-11 planes ended in 2000.",

    "body": "17 hours agoGeorge Wright and Andre Rhoden-PaulReutersIDF soldier Hadar Goldin was killed in Gaza in 2014Israel has received the body of Lt Hadar Goldin, a soldier killed in an ambush by Hamas in 2014 and whose body has been held in Gaza since then.The Israeli military said Lt Goldin, who was 23 when he died, was formally identified and will now be buried. He left behind parents, a sister, two brothers, and a fiancée.Hamas's armed wing had said on Sunday that it would hand over Lt Goldin's body as part of a ceasefire deal.Hamas has now returned all 20 living hostages, and 24 out of 28 deceased hostages under the first phase of the deal.On Sunday, Lt Goldin's father Simcha Goldin said in a statement: \"Victory means bringing home the hostages and bringing home our soldiers to Israel.\"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog both said they had kept a picture of Lt Goldin in their offices for the past 11 years. Netanyahu said \"we didn't give up\" on bringing him home.\"I know the agony that his family's been through, I know the longing for his return that united the people of Israel and today we're united in bringing him finally to his parents, to his family, to a grave in Israel.\"Efforts to retrieve Lt Goldin \"involved extensive intelligence efforts, alongside operational activities on the ground\" over the past decade and during the last two years of war between Israel and Hamas, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.The military expressed \"deep condolences to the family and continues to make every effort to return all the deceased hostages and is prepared for the continued implementation of the agreement\".Herzog said the government would \"continue to act tirelessly\" to bring home all the hostages.Of the four hostages who remain in Gaza, three are Israeli and one is Thai.ReutersLt Goldin, from Kfar Saba, is the only deceased hostage whose remains were being held in Gaza before the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, which sparked the latest war. He was killed in combat on 1 August 2014, not long after the start of a ceasefire in that year's war between Israel and Hamas. He was among a group of Israeli soldiers patrolling an agricultural area near Rafah in southern Gaza when they were attacked by a group of Hamas fighters. The Israeli military determined that Lt Goldin was killed along with two other soldiers in a firefight, and that his body was then dragged into an underground tunnel by the Hamas fighters.The Israeli military unleashed massive firepower to try to prevent Hamas from taking Lt Goldin hostage. Scores of Palestinian civilians were killed in the bombardment of Rafah, which continued for four days, including after Lt Goldin was declared dead.Nine years later, the Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage. At least 69,176 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures the UN considers reliable.During the ongoing first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Before Lt Goldin's body was returned, Israel had also handed over the bodies of 300 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of 20 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas, along with those of three foreign hostages - one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.The parties also agreed to an increase of aid to the Gaza Strip, a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a halt to fighting, although violence has flared up as both sides accused one another of breaching the deal.On Saturday in Gaza, two Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire. The Israeli military said two people had crossed the yellow line marking the line of Israeli control and posed an \"immediate threat\".Separately, one Palestinian was shot dead in Gaza by Israeli fire and another was wounded on Saturday, local medics and the Israeli military said.Gazan medical officials said the person who died was killed by Israeli fire east of Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. Civil defence rescuers said the injured Palestinian was wounded by Israeli gunfire in Khan Younis.Israeli military actions have killed at least 241 people since the start of the ceasefire, according to the Gaza health ministry.",

    "body": "16 hours agoKathryn Armstrong, André Rhoden-Paul and Lulu Luo,Aurora, Philippines The BBC's Jonathan Head says the Philippines is braced for an \"absolutely massive storm\"Typhoon Fung-wong has made landfall in the Philippines, where more than 900,000 people have been evacuated and two people have died.The storm hit as a super typhoon, with sustained winds of around 185 km/h (115mph) and gusts of 230km/h (143mph).The eye of the storm hit Aurora province in Luzon - the country's most populous island - at 21:10 local time (13:10 GMT). By 02:00, the storm weakened to a typhoon and was over La Union in western Luzon.The country's meteorological service warned of destructive winds and \"high-risk of life-threatening\" storm surges from the \"very intense\" typhoon.Fung-wong - known locally as Uwan - comes days after earlier storm Kalmaegi left  nearly 200 people dead.Eastern parts of the Philippines had already begun experiencing heavy rains and winds on Saturday evening, a weather official said. Residents in Catanduanes, an island in the east of the Bicol region, as well as in other low-lying and coastal areas, had been urged to move to higher ground by Sunday morning.The storm passed near the eastern Bicol region on Sunday morning, before making its way past the Polillo Islands on Sunday afternoon.The civil defence office reported that one person drowned and firefighters recovered the body of a woman trapped under debris in Catbalogan City. The civil aviation regulator has closed several airports, and almost 300 flights have been cancelled. Fung-wong was expected to weaken after making landfall, but is likely to remain a typhoon as it travels over Luzon.More than 200mm of rain is forecast for parts of Luzon, with even 100-200mm in the Metro Manilla area. This is expected to cause severe flooding and landslides.  CHARISM SAYAT/AFP via Getty ImageA landslide-hit residential area in Guinobatan town, Albay province, south of ManilaIn the Aurora region, in eastern Luzon, BBC News spoke to Hagunoy, 21, who works at one of the dozen hotels which line the coast in Sabang.He said police had repeatedly visited in recent days to ensure all guests were evacuated ahead of the storm. The hotels were all deserted on Sunday morning.While the tide had risen sharply, Hagunoy said he would stay as long as he could to guard the property, before riding his motorbike home to safety. Staff had secured the gates and tied windows shut with rope to try to stop the glass from shattering in the wind.EPA/ShutterstockThe Filipino Coast Guard undertook evacuations ahead of the typhoon in Quezon provinceIn central Aurora, more than 200 people arrived at a shelter in a sports centre. Many parents have brought young children, too young to remember Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,000 people when it struck the Philippines in 2013. \"We felt very worried because of the strength of the typhoon, and we have young children to think of,\" Jessa Zurbano told the BBC.Another evacuee Patry Azul said: \"Our house is made of wood and flimsy materials. We live close to the sea so we didn't feel safe.\"Fung-wong has also forced the suspension of rescue operations following the passage of Kalmaegi, one of the strongest typhoons this year.Heavy rainfall sent torrents of mud down hillsides and into residential areas. Some poorer neighbourhoods were obliterated by the fast-moving flash floods.At least 204 people are now known to have died in the Philippines as a result of the earlier storm, while more than 100 are still missing. Five people also died in Vietnam, where strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows.Families gathered at this shelter in a sports centre in central Aurora in eastern LuzonThe Filipino government declared a state of calamity across the country after Typhoon Kalmaegi and in preparation for the coming storm.It has given government agencies more power to access emergency funds and fast-track deliveries of essential goods and services.For some Filipinos, the devastation wrought by Kalmaegi has left them even more anxious about the storm to come.\"We decided to evacuate because the recent typhoon brought floods in our area, and now I just want to keep my family safe,\" Norlito Dugan told the AFP news agency.He is among those who have taken shelter in a church in the city of Sorsogon in Luzon.Another resident, Maxine Dugan said: \"I'm here because the waves near my house are now huge.\"How do hurricanes or typhoons form and are they getting stronger?The Philippines - located near the area where Pacific Ocean tropical weather systems form - is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to cyclones.About 20 tropical cyclones form in that region every year, half of which affect the country directly.Climate change is not thought to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones worldwide.However, warmer oceans coupled with a warmer atmosphere - fuelled by climate change - have the potential to make those that do form even more intense. That can potentially lead to higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall, and a greater risk of coastal flooding.",

    "body": "17 hours agoTodah OpeyemiBBC Africa, LagosXThe protesters insulted the visitors who had come for a preview eventProtesters targeted a new multi-million dollar museum in Nigeria and forced organisers to halt a preview event ahead of Tuesday's grand opening.Videos showed a group insulting foreign guests and ordering them to leave after entering the grounds of the Museum of West African Art (Mowaa) in Benin City on Sunday. The museum in Edo state was in part conceived as a home for the Benin Bronzes - artefacts looted from there by British soldiers in the 19th Century. The campus includes state-of-the art preservation and restoration facilities.However, a bitter dispute over the control of the prized artworks has meant they are not at the museum, something that appeared to have angered the protesters.All guests were safely escorted to secure locations, according to a statement from the museum.\"We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this situation may have caused,\" Mowaa said.A local resident told the BBC the frustration stems from what many see as a hijacking of an Edo project. \"The Benin Oba [king], traditional rulers and the government of Edo are not happy about it,\" the resident added.Museum of West African Art (MOWAA), Marco Cappelletti/Marco Cappelletti StudioMowaa, designed by British-Ghanian architect David Adjaye, cost an estimated $25m (£19m) to build\"Edo\" was initially in the museum's name, but this was later dropped. Executive director Phillip Ihenacho told the BBC the backers wanted the institution to serve a wider purpose beyond Nigeria.In its statement, Mowaa said the protest \"appeared to stem from disputes between the previous and current state administrations\".The museum emphasised it was an independent, non-profit organisation and, though a former state governor had backed the project, he had no interest in it \"financial or otherwise\".Mowaa has now cancelled all preview events leading up to the opening and advised visitors to avoid the campus until the situation is resolved.\"We are deeply grateful to all our guests - many of whom travelled long distances to be here - for their understanding, patience and resilience,\" the statement said. \"We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this situation may have caused.\"You may also be interested in:Ghana, Nigeria and the quest for UK looted treasureBenin Bronzes declaration 'blindsides' museum officialsThe art dealer, the £10m Benin Bronze and the HolocaustGetty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "8 hours agoAndré Rhoden-Paul and Kelly Ng,SingaporeAt least seven people have died after a boat carrying undocumented migrants sank near the border between Thailand and Malaysia.Thirteen people have been rescued but hundreds are missing - they were among a group of 300 people, most of whom are Rohingyas, who left Myanmar's impoverished Rakhine state two weeks ago on a larger vessel before splitting onto small boats, said a Malaysian maritime official.The capsized vessel is believed to have gone down near the resort island of Langkawi, the Malaysian Coast Guard said.Rescue efforts have entered a second day, with the search area expanded from 170 to 256 square nautical miles. Malaysia's maritime authority expects the search to last seven days.The body found in the water on Sunday was that of a Rohingya woman, Malaysia's state-owned news agency Bernama reported.Of the 13 rescued, 11 are Rohingyas and two are Bangladeshis. The sunken boat was carrying about 70 people, while the status of the boats carrying the remaining migrants are \"unclear\", Malaysian authorities said on Monday.The Rohingyas, who are primarily Muslim, are one of the many ethnic minorities in the predominantly Buddhist country, but they are denied citizenship by the government of Myanmar.Since August 2017, a deadly crackdown by Myanmar's army sent hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas fleeing across the border into Bangladesh.Conflict and poor living conditions in Bangladesh however have also prompted some Rohingyas to make precarious journeys on overcrowded vessels to Malaysia, a Muslim country which some envision to be a safe haven in the region.Officials say many of them would have each paid more than $3,000 (£2,300) for these passages by sea.These boats are often small and cramped, lacking in basic facilities like water and sanitation. And they do not always make it to Malaysia. Some die while being stranded at sea, while others are sometimes detained or deported. ",

    "body": "1 day agoGrace Eliza GoodwinGetty ImagesTravellers wait in a long line at a security checkpoint at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport on 6 NovemberMore than 1,400 flights to, from, or within the US were cancelled on Saturday after airlines were told this week to cut traffic during the federal government shutdown.Nearly 6,000 flights were also delayed, down from over 7,000 delays on Friday, according to flight tracker FlightAware. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced earlier in the week that it would be reducing air travel capacity by up to10% at 40 of the nation's busiest airports as air traffic controllers, who are working without pay during the shutdown,  report fatigue.Republicans and Democrats remain divided over how to end the impasse in Congress. Saturday marked the 39th day of the longest shutdown in history. Senators are in Washington over the weekend for bipartisan negotitations aimed at resolving the deadlock. Republicans have rejected an offer by Democrats to pass the current funding bill, in exchange for a one-year extension to health care subsidies.The shutdown is beginning to be felt by more and more Americans amid cuts to food aid payments and the flight disruptions. In a statement on Saturday, American Airlines urged party leaders \"to reach an immediate resolution to end the shutdown\".New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport was experiencing some of the longest wait times. As of Saturday afternoon, arrivals to the airport were delayed by an average of more than four hours, while departures from the airport were delayed by an average of 90 minutes, according to the FAA. The airports with the most cancelled flights on Saturday, both to and from the location, were Charlotte/Douglas International, Newark Liberty International, and Chicago O'Hare International, according to FlightAware. Flights to John F Kennedy and LaGuardia airports in New York were delayed by nearly three hours and an hour respectively, the FAA reported on Saturday afternoon. Other airports affected by lengthy delays inncluded Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International. With the Thanksgiving holiday approaching on 27 November, it's one of the busiest travel seasons of the year in the US. It's not just commercial flights that have been affected. Restrictions on private jets are also in place, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a Saturday post on X.  \"We've reduced their volume at high traffic airports - instead having private jets utilise smaller airports or airfields so busy controllers can focus on commercial aviation,\" Duffy wrote. \"That's only fair.\"And things are likely to get worse in the coming days as the FAA cancels more flights. On Thursday, the agency announced that the flight reductions would be gradual, starting at 4% of  flights on Friday before rising to 6% by 11 November, 8% by 13 November, and the full 10% by 14 November.The FAA said the cuts were necessary to maintain safety as air traffic controllers have been overworked during the shutdown. As essential workers, the controllers are required to continue working without pay, and as a result, many have called in sick or taken on second jobs to afford necessities, unions say. Watch: \"Devastating\" - Airline travellers react to flight reductionsThe controllers are just some of the 1.4 million federal workers who have either been working without pay or been put on forced during the shutdown.Another factor impacting air travel is that most of the Transportation Security Agency (TSA) 64,000 agents are also not being paid while the shutdown is in place.During the last government shutdown, under the first Trump administration in 2018, it was found that up to 10% of TSA staff chose to stay at home rather than work while they weren't receiving a paycheque.",

    "body": "1 day agoTiffany Wertheimer and Damian ZaneEPANicholas Oyoo (L) and Bob Njagi (R) were greeted by supporters when they arrived back in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, on SaturdayUgandan President Yoweri Museveni has for the first time acknowledged that two Kenyan activists who were missing in his country for five weeks had been arrested.Last month, eyewitnesses reported seeing Bob Njagi and Nicholas Oyoo being forced into a car by masked uniformed men after a political event where they were supporting Ugandan opposition leader Bobi Wine.News of their release was confirmed on Saturday but up to that point the authorities had denied that they were being detained.In a live interview on Saturday evening, Museveni described the two men as \"experts in riots\" who had then been put \"in the fridge for some days\".The president, who has been in power for almost four decades and is running for another term in office, was responding to a question about the recent deadly youth-led protests in neighbouring Tanzania.Museveni blamed foreign groups for stoking up trouble and said \"the ones who are doing that game here in Uganda will end up badly\".Without naming them, he added that the two Kenyan activists were released after he received calls from \"some Kenyan leaders\" who said they should be handed back. Mr Njagi and Mr Oyoo were welcomed by supporters at the main airport in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, on Saturday.\"Thirty-eight days of abduction was not easy. We didn't think that we were going to come out alive because we were being abducted by the military,\" Mr Njagi said. Kenya's Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi said their release followed \"sustained diplomatic engagement between Kenya and Uganda\".Activist organisation Vocal Africa, who had been campaigning for the two men to be freed said: \"Let this moment signal an important shift towards upholding the human rights of East Africans anywhere in East African Community\".In a joint statement, Vocal Africa, the Law Society of Kenya and Amnesty International thanked the Kenyan and Ugandan governments, as well as \"all active citizens\" who had campaigned for the release.Former pop star Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, is running against Museveni for the presidency in next year's elections.Bobi Wine accused the Ugandan government of targeting the two Kenyans for associating with him. \"If they committed any offence, why were they not produced before court and formally charged?\" he asked in a post on X on Sunday.Ugandan security agencies have often been accused of orchestrating the detention of opposition politicians and supporters while not in uniform. Some of those arrested have later resurfaced in court facing criminal charges.The latest disappearances mirror past incidents involving politicians and activists across the East African region.Last year, Njagi was picked up in Kenya by masked men during a wave of abductions believed to have been targeting government critics in the country.He surfaced a month later, after a court ordered police to produce him. He later recounted the harrowing conditions in captivity, where he said he was often isolated and denied food.Earlier this year, Kenyan activist Boniface Mwangi and his Ugandan counterpart Agather Atuhaire were detained in Tanzania and held incommunicado for days before being abandoned at their respective national borders.They later recounted being brutally mistreated, including sexual torture at the hands of the Tanzanian authorities – allegations which police dismissed as \"hearsay\".Last year, another Uganda opposition figure, Kizza Besigye, mysteriously disappeared in Nairobi only to surface four days later in a military court in Uganda, where he faces treason charges.The cases have since sparked widespread condemnation and concerns that East African governments could be collaborating to contain dissent.You may also be interested in:How a Ugandan opposition leader disappeared in Kenya and ended up in military court'We live in fear' - forced expulsions taint Kenya's safe haven imageUganda's Yoweri Museveni: How an ex-rebel has stayed in power for 35 yearsBobi Wine: Uganda's 'ghetto president'Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "20 minutes agoAna FaguyWashingtonEPAUS Senate Majority Leader John Thune helped negtotiate the weekend deal A deal aimed at ending the US government shutdown has passed the Senate, paving the way for the record-breaking impasse to be broken.After a weekend of negotiations in Washington, a minority of Democrats joined with Republicans and voted in favour of an agreement. The vote is a procedural first step towards passing a compromise to fund the government since it ran out of money 1 October.It will need to clear several more hurdles - including a vote from the House of Representatives - before federal employees and services return, but it is the first serious sign of progress after 40 days of deadlock. The Senate is expected to return for further debate at 11:00 local time (16:00 GMT) on Monday.The current shutdown is the longest on record in the US, and until this weekend it appeared that Republican and Democratic lawmakers were locked in a stalemate. Many government services have been suspended since October, and around 1.4 million federal employees are on unpaid leave or working without pay. The shutdown has had wide ranging impacts on a variety of services, including US air travel and food benefits for 41 million low-income Americans. The agreement was negotiated between Senate Majority Leader John Thune and the White House, with Democratic senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, and Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats.Republicans - who hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate - needed the measure to clear a 60-vote minimum threshold.They were able attract eight votes from the other side of the aisle, while losing just one in Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, who voted against after saying the bill would increase national debt.The deal includes an agreement for a vote in December on extending healthcare subsidies that are due to expire this year, a key issue Democrats had been holding out for concessions on. Watch: Moment deal aimed at ending US shutdown passesDemocratic Party leaders had said that they would not lend their support to new funding for government operations until Congress addressed the subsidies that help tens of millions of Americans pay for health insurance purchased through government-run exchanges.\"I'm thankful to be able to say we have senators, both Democrats and Republicans, who are eager to get to work to address that crisis in a bipartisan way,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune said ahead of the vote.\"We also have a president who is willing to sit down and get to work on this issue. So I'm looking forward to seeing what solutions might be brought forward.\"Thune did not say exactly what that bill would contain, which frustrated many Democrats in the House and the Senate, who argued that the Democrats who negotiated the deal did so without getting enough in return. \"For months and months Democrats have been fighting to get the Senate to address the healthcare crisis,\" said Chuck Schumer, the party's leader in the Senate. \"This bill does nothing to ensure that that crisis is addressed,\" he said as he confirmed he would vote against the deal.Some high-profile Democrats have been highly critical of colleagues who sided with Republicans to end the shutdown without concrete guarantees on healthcare, with California Governor Gavin Newsom calling the decision \"pathetic\". The measure also includes three appropriations bills to fund agencies like veterans affairs and agriculture, as well as a continuing resolution to finance the rest of the government until 30 January - meaning another government shutdown could be on the horizon early next year.It also includes guarantees that all federal workers will be paid for time during the shutdown, and funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) - an essential food safety net for one in eight Americans - until next September.A vote on the deal would only be the first procedural step in the new funding agreement and it would still need to be approved by the US House of Representatives, where it is likely to see its own challenges.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "1 day agoAndré Rhoden-PaulEPADonald Trump has said the US will not attend the G20 summit in South Africa over widely discredited claims that white people are being persecuted in the country. The US president said it was a \"total disgrace\" that South Africa is hosting the meeting, where leaders from the world's largest economies will gather in Johannesburg later this month. South Africa's foreign ministry described the decision by the White House as \"regrettable\", while a spokesman for the foreign ministry, Chrispin Phiri, told BBC News that the success of the summit will not \"rest on one member state\".None of South Africa's political parties claim that there is a genocide in South Africa.That includes parties that represent Afrikaners and the white community in general.  Speaking to the Newshour programme, Mr Phiri said that Trump was \"orchestrating an imagined crisis… using the painful history of South Africa's colonial past\".He also said there was \"absolutely no evidence of white persecution in South Africa\", adding: \"South Africa does have its problems and we are dealing with those. I think crime affects everyone, regardless of their race.\"\"We will move on without the United States,\" he said.Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social: \"It is a total disgrace that the G20 will be held in South Africa.\"Afrikaners (people who are descended from Dutch settlers, and also French and German immigrants) are being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated,\" he wrote.\"No US government official will attend as long as these human rights abuses continue.\"South Africa's government said the claims of a white genocide are \"widely discredited and unsupported by reliable evidence\".The claims were dismissed as \"clearly imagined\" by a South African court in February.Trump had earlier said South Africa should not be in the G20 at all, and that he would send vice-president JD Vance, instead of attending himself. But now the White House says no US official will go.ReutersDonald Trump  confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in May Every year, a different member state hosts the G20 and sets the agenda for the summit - with the US due to take its turn after South Africa.The South African foreign ministry said in a statement: \"The South African government wishes to state, for the record, that the characterisation of Afrikaners as an exclusively white group is ahistorical. \"Furthermore, the claim that this community faces persecution, is not substantiated by fact.\"Since returning to office in January, Trump has repeatedly accused South Africa of discriminating against its white minority, including in May when when he confronted his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa in the Oval Office. The Trump administration has given Afrikaners refugee status, on the basis of the discredited \"genocide\" claims. Last week, the White House announced plans to cap refugee admissions at a record low, and give priority to white South Africans. The South African government has pointed to the \"limited uptake\" of the offer by South Africans. The G20 was founded in 1999 after the Asian financial crisis. The nations involved have more than 85% of the world's wealth and its aim was to restore economic stability.The first leaders' summit was held in 2008 in response to that year's global financial turmoil, to promote international co-operation.Now the leaders get together each year - along with representatives of the European Union and African Union - to talk about the world's economies and the issues countries are facing.",

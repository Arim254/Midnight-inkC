He had argued it was a case of mistaken identity.</p><p>The conflict lasted from 2003 to 2020 and was one of the world's gravest humanitarian disasters.</p></div><div><p>Five years after the end of that crisis, Darfur is a key battleground in another civil war, this time between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), whose origins lie in the Janjaweed.</p><p>During Kushayb's trial, survivors described how their villages were burned down, men and boys slaughtered and women forced into sex slavery.</p><p>The militia leader was found guilty on 27 counts, centring on attacks committed between 2003 and 2004.</p><p>Judges at the ICC found the Janjaweed's brutal tactics - including mass executions, sexual violence and torture - were often inflicted by Kushayb and his men.</p><p>Ahead of the verdict, a small group of Darfuris waited patiently to enter the court, in the Dutch city of The Hague.</p><p>They were in no doubt about the pivotal role Kushayb played in their suffering, with one man saying: \"He was the one who gave the orders. He was the one who got the weapons. </p><p>\"So if you ask me if he was important in Darfur, I will you tell you he was one of the most important ones.\"</p><p>The Darfur war began after the Arab-dominated government at the time armed the Janjaweed, in an attempt to suppress an uprising by rebels from black African ethnic groups. </p><p>The Janjaweed systematically attacked non-Arab villagers accused of supporting the rebels, leading to accusations of genocide.</p><p>That same systematic violence is still happening in Darfur as part of the Sudan's civil war.</p><p>Many of the Janjaweed fighters have morphed into the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the paramilitary group that is currently battling Sudan's army.</p><p>The UK, US and rights groups have accused the RSF of carrying out ethnic cleansing against non-Arab communities in Darfur since the conflict began in 2023.</p><p>Kushayb will be sentenced at a later date.</p></div>",

    "body": "<div><p>Balloons carrying thousands of packs of cigarettes have disrupted flights in Lithuania, as Vilnius Airport was forced to close for hours when dozens of them floated into the country's airspace.</p><p>The National Crisis Management Centre (NCMC) told the BBC that 25 meteorological balloons were detected entering Lithuania from neighbouring Belarus, two of which ended up directly over the airport.</p><p>The airport said the shutdown led to 30 flight cancellations affecting 6,000 passengers. It warned that there may still be delays on Monday.</p><p>The \"airspace violations\" come at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c708dzqvz1vo\">a time of heightened tension in Europe</a> after a number of drone incursions, suspected of being linked to Russia, caused air traffic disruption.</p></div><div><p>Moscow has denied any involvement in the recent incidents.</p><p>Up to 14 of the weather balloons launched over the weekend floated over the Vilnius area, home to Lithuania's capital and close to the border with Belarus, Lithuanian officials said.</p><p>At least 11 balloons carrying 18,000 packs of black-market cigarettes have since been recovered, though this number could rise, Lithuania's State Border Guard Service said.</p><p>Despite the disruption they caused, a NCMC spokesman said: \"Balloons with contraband cargo - cigarettes from Belarus - are nothing new in Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland.\"</p><p>So far this year, 544 balloons have been recorded entering Lithuania from Belarus, he said, while 966 were last year.</p><p>Meanwhile, the north-eastern Podlaskie region of Poland, which also borders Belarus, has recorded more than 100 cases in which contraband was flown in from its neighbour using the balloons, which are typically used to carry weather instruments to high altitudes.</p><p>In one instance last month, Polish police detained a Belarusian citizen whose car had been circling cigarettes smuggled in using a balloon. A geolocation tag was reportedly found on his phone linked to the illicit goods.  </p><p>Asked why criminals use a method that is highly susceptible to the weather, rather than much more controllable drones, the NCMC spokesman said: \"Meteorological balloons are a rudimentary tool used by smugglers - they are cheaper than drones for transporting cigarettes from Belarus.\"</p><p>He added: \"Our services' aim is to seize the largest possible quantities of contraband and to detain organisers and perpetrators so that this activity is unprofitable and does not pose a risk to civil aviation.\"</p><p>Drones of unclear origin caused the closure of Danish airports and airspace in September. Drones were also seen over neighbouring Norway and Germany, prompting European leaders to accelerate discussions about strengthening air defences.</p><p>Denmark said at the time there was no evidence to suggest Russian involvement, despite Moscow being blamed for earlier airspace incursions into Poland, Estonia and Romania. </p><p>Russia either denied these earlier incursions or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7401vk4lgzo\">said they were accidental</a> as its full-scale invasion of nearby Ukraine continues.</p></div>",

It is thought 48 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, 20 of whom are believed to be alive.</p><p>Trump said over the weekend the hostages could be released \"very soon\", while Netanyahu said they could be freed before the end of the Jewish holiday Sukkot - or October 13th.</p><p>Hamas has agreed to the hostage \"exchange formula\" detailed in Trump's plan, providing certain \"field conditions\" are met.</p><p>But the hostages are the group's only bargaining chip - and it's unclear whether it would be willing to release them before other elements of the deal are finalised.</p><p>Trust between the two sides is virtually non-existent. Only last month, Israel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2zepgp5neo\">attempted to assassinate Hamas's negotiating team</a> with an air strike on Doha - angering not only Hamas but also Donald Trump and Qatar, a key mediator.</p><p>Members of that same negotiating team - headed by Khalil al-Hayya, whose son was killed in the strike - will now be meeting just a stone's throw from Israel's delegation in Egypt.</p></div><p></p><h2>Hamas disarmament</h2><p></p><div><p>Israel's stated goal throughout the war has been the destruction of Hamas. Netanyahu has repeatedly stated he will not stop until the group is finished. </p><p>A key point in Trump's plan requires the group to disarm. But Hamas has previously refused to lay down its weapons, saying it would only do so once a Palestinian state has been established.</p><p>In its response, Hamas made no mention of disarmament - fuelling speculation that it has not changed its position.</p><p>Over the weekend, Netanyahu vowed: \"Hamas will be disarmed and Gaza will be demilitarised – either the easy way or the hard way\".</p></div><p></p><h2>Future governance of Gaza</h2><p></p><div><p>The plan states that Hamas will have no future role in Gaza, which will be governed by a temporary transitional body of Palestinian technocrats - supervised by a \"Board of Peace\" headed and chaired by Donald Trump and involving former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p><p>Governance of the Strip would eventually be handed over to the Palestinian Authority (PA).</p><p>Though Netanyahu agreed to all of Trump's 20-point plan, he appeared to push back on involvement of the PA even as he stood on the podium next to the president last week, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jq63edv21o\">insisting it would play no role</a> in governing the territory.</p><p>This is one of many points in the plan that will be objectionable to ultranationalist hardliners within Netanyahu's governing coalition - many of whom want to retain control of Gaza and reconstruct Jewish settlements there.</p><p>In Hamas's response, it indicated that it expects to have some future role in Gaza as part of \"a unified Palestinian movement\". Though the wording is vague, this will likely be unacceptable to both Trump and the Israelis.</p></div><p></p><h2>Israeli withdrawal</h2><p></p><div><p>The extent of Israel's military withdrawal is a fourth point of contention.</p><p>The plan states that Israel's military will withdraw from Gaza \"based on standards, milestones, and timeframes\" that must be agreed by all parties.</p><p>A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c5ykwny8dp9o\">map distributed by the White House</a> showed three proposed stages of Israeli troop withdrawal. The first stage leaves about 55% of Gaza under Israeli control, the second 40%, and the final 15%.</p><p>That final stage would be a \"security perimeter\" that would \"remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat\".</p><p>The wording here is vague and gives no clear timeline for full Israeli withdrawal - something Hamas are likely to want clarity on.</p><p>Additionally, the map shared by the White House doesn't match up with the Israeli military's own maps showing militarised areas, and Gaza's borders are incorrectly drawn in places.</p></div><div><p><span> More on this story</span></p></div></article>",

French people are fed up. Macron has put the country in an extremely difficult position,\" she added.</p><p>The decision on how to proceed now rests with Macron, who must surely be asking himself how long this political charade can be allowed to go on.</p><p>He has three options. He can appoint another prime minister. He can once again dissolve the National Assembly. Or he can resign himself.</p><p>The last is the least likely, while the first would be his natural choice.</p><p>However, who now could he name to form a government? Lecornu – the ultimate Macron loyalist – was seen as his last resort, but now he too has failed.</p><p>He could appoint a Socialist, on the basis that the left deserves a go at government - but a Socialist administration would itself not take long to fall.</p><p>So the logic must surely be for option two: for new legislative elections.</p><p>The result would probably be a rout for the pro-Macron centre, and a big victory for the hard-right of Marine Le Pen. But when every other recourse fails, few avenues remain.</p><p>Various French media reported that Macron was not expected to make a statement on Monday, leaving questions swirling over what his next move to break the impasse will be.</p><p>Lecornu, a former armed forces minister, was France's fifth prime minister in under two years. </p><p>In his brief speech outside the Hôtel de Matignon, the prime minister's residence, which he only occupied for less than a month, Lecornu sharply criticised the \"partisan appetites\" of political factions, who he said \"are all behaving as if they had an absolute majority\". </p><p>\"I was ready for compromise but all parties wanted the other party to adopt their programmes in their entirety,\" he said. </p><p>\"It wouldn't need much for this to work,\" he added, saying, however, that parties needed to be more humble and \"to cast some egos aside\".</p><p>French politics has been highly unstable since July 2024, when Macron called for snap parliamentary elections in a bid to achieve a clear majority following a bruising loss for his party in the European Parliament vote.</p><p>Instead the elections resulted in a hung parliament divided into ideologically opposed factions deeply at odds with one another and unwilling to work together. </p><p>This has made it difficult for any prime minister to garner the necessary support to pass any bills.</p><p>Michel Barnier was appointed prime minister last September but was ousted within three months. </p><p>The government of his successor François Bayrou's too was voted down after nine months after parliament refused to back his austerity budget, which aimed to slash government spending by €44bn ($51bn; £38bn). </p><p>France's deficit reached 5.8% of its GDP in 2024 and its national debt is 114% of its GDP. That is the third highest public debt in the eurozone after Greece and Italy, and equivalent to almost €50,000 per French citizen.</p><p>Stocks fell sharply on the Paris exchange after the news of Lecornu's resignation broke on Monday morning.</p></div>",

Her legal team must convince the appeal court in the state of Victoria that there were legal errors and that it should hear the appeal.

Hundreds of local villagers and rescue workers have been deployed to clear out snow blocking access to the area, which sits at an altitude of more than 4,900m (16,000ft). </p><p>Rescuers have guided 350 people to safety in the small township of Qudang.

The snowfall was so heavy I could hardly sleep,\" Mr Dong explained.</p><p>His group had reached an altitude of 4,600m before they decided to turn back.  </p><p>\"Our windbreakers and raincoats were no match for the snow. We were all drenched,\" he said, adding that several people in his group of 20 showed signs of hypothermia.</p><p>The 27-year-old had been to the Himalayas more than a dozen times, but said he has \"never experienced weather like this\". </p><p>Mr Dong's escape from the trail was lined with wet snow and falling sleet.</p><p>\"Everyone was moving slowly.

The Trump administration is expected to quickly appeal the decision. </p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgq044n72po\">US cities should be military training grounds, Trump tells generals</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dnk0ee6pyo\">Trump authorises deployment of 300 National Guard troops to Chicago</a></li></ul><p>Meanwhile, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said late on Sunday night that Trump was \"ordering 400 members of the Texas National Guard for deployments to Illinois, Oregon, and other locations within the United States\".</p><p>In a statement, the governor called the proposed deployment \"Trump's invasion\", and said there was \"no reason\" to send troops into any state without the \"knowledge, consent, or cooperation\" of local officials.</p><p>He told CNN that the authorisation of troops there would incite protests and accused the administration of creating a \"warzone\" to rationalise the response.</p><p>Pritzker also called on Texas Governor Greg Abbott to \"immediately withdraw any support for this decision and refuse to co-ordinate\".</p><p>In response, Abbott said he \"fully authorized\" Trump's decision to call up the Texas National Guard \"to ensure safety for federal officials\".</p><p>\"You can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let Texas Guard do it,\" he said in a statement on X.</p><p>Like Portland, Chicago has seen protests over increased immigration enforcement. On Saturday, protests became violent, with immigration authorities saying they opened fire on an armed woman after she and others allegedly rammed their cars into law enforcement vehicles. </p><p>The woman's condition is unclear, but officials said she drove herself to hospital. </p><p>Protests have been ongoing in Portland and other cities over the Trump administration's increased immigration enforcement. </p><p>Portland, in particular, has long drawn Trump's ire over its alleged concentration of people his supporters describe as Antifa, short for \"anti-fascist\". The president recently signed an executive order designating the group, which is a loosely organised movement of far-left activists, as a domestic terrorist organisation.</p><p>The Portland deployment came one day after Trump authorised the deployment of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dnk0ee6pyo\">300 National Guard troops to Chicago</a> under a similar pretext.</p><p>The National Guard is the primary combat reserve of the Army and Air Force. The state-based military force can be called up by either a state governor or the US president. It is often deployed to provide disaster relief after floods and hurricanes but can also support military operations overseas.</p><p>Over the summer, Trump directed National Guard troops to be deployed in Washington, DC, and Los Angeles, saying they were needed to quell crime or protests. These were significant decisions, as deployments are typically left to a state's governor. </p><p>Trump has sought to use National Guard troops in a number of US cities to crack down on crime and support immigration enforcement - including in Washington, DC, and Los Angeles, California. </p><p>In September, a federal judge in California ruled Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles was illegal because it violated an act that limits the power of the federal government to use military force for domestic matters.</p><p>The administration is appealing that decision. </p></div><p>Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68093155\">US Politics Unspun</a> newsletter.

He pleaded not guilty.</p><p>A US federal charge ruled on Friday that Mr Garcia's prosecution could be for \"vindictive\" reasons, and he would hear more evidence before reaching a final decision. </p><p>The BBC has asked Eswatini government acting spokesperson Thabile Mdluli whether or not he was among the latest group to be deported. </p><p>In an earlier statement, she said the deportees would be kept in a \"secured area separate from the public, while arrangements are made for their return to their countries of origin\". </p><p>Their arrival comes a day before a court case against the deportations is set to resume in the main city, Mbabane. </p><p>Mr Masuku, who represents civil society groups groups challenging the deal, said he would have expected  the government to \"respect the court process and await its ruling\" before accepting more deportees. </p><p>In September, campaign group Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it had seen the agreement between the Eswatini and US governments. </p><p>It provides for Eswatini to accept up to 160 deportees in exchange for $5.1m (£3.79m) from the US to build its \"border and migration management capacity\", HRW said.</p><p>The Southern African Litigation Centre (SALC) - along with other civil society groups - argues that the government's decision amounts to \"executive over-reach\" and Eswatini's constitution states that such agreements should be reached with parliamentary consent, something that did not happen in this instance. </p><p>Activists also protested against the deal outside the US embassy when the first deportees arrived.</p><p>The civic groups say the deal is secretive and an example of \"democratic regression\", 20 years after Eswatini adopted a constitution to give more of a say to parliament in a country where the king has long wielded absolute power.</p><p>\"We would have expected this milestone to reflect a maturation of our democracy - stronger rule of law, greater accountability, and clearer separation of powers,\" the SALC's  Melusi Simelane told the BBC. </p><p>The government is defending the case, saying it acted within its powers and that the constitution makes allowances for it to reach such agreements with foreign governments.</p><p>Some Eswatini MPs had previously raised concerns about the deal in parliament, but Prime Minister Russell Dlamini said it had been handled at  \"top clearance level\". </p><p>The deal also alarmed neighbouring South Africa, which expressed fears that the deportees could cross into the country via their porous border. </p><p>Ms Mdluli tried to allay the fears by saying the deportees were being held in solitary confinement in a secure facility. </p><p>Previously known as Swaziland, Eswatini is a small, landlocked country surrounded by South Africa and Mozambique. It has been led by King Mswati III since 1986.</p></div>",

Hardliners in Tehran are also worried and are threatening to block the project.</p></div><p></p><h2>War and peace in the Caucasus</h2><p></p><div><p>The Tripp proposal is key to ending a conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan that started over Nagorno-Karabakh, a part of Azerbaijan historically populated by Armenians. </p><p>In 2023, Azerbaijan recaptured the disputed region, and virtually the entire Armenian population fled their homes. This was not the first such expulsion in this conflict: in the 1990s over 500,000 Azerbaijanis were displaced.</p><p>Vanyan was among those who fled their homes in 2023. </p><p>Having escaped the war zone, he settled in Armenia's southern province of Syunik just when it became a new hotspot between the two neighbours.</p><p>Azerbaijan demanded that Armenia give part of this region as a \"corridor\" to its exclave of Nakhchivan. The region is also known as Zangezur, and the proposal was branded the \"Zangezur corridor\".</p><p>But when Armenia rejected the demand, clashes erupted on the border, and many feared a new war.</p><p>Then, in August 2025, Trump unexpectedly broke the deadlock. Hosting Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan at the White House, he offered a solution designed to satisfy both sides.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f95f/live/13607840-9b00-11f0-8272-7f0194ae8142.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f95f/live/13607840-9b00-11f0-8272-7f0194ae8142.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f95f/live/13607840-9b00-11f0-8272-7f0194ae8142.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f95f/live/13607840-9b00-11f0-8272-7f0194ae8142.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f95f/live/13607840-9b00-11f0-8272-7f0194ae8142.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f95f/live/13607840-9b00-11f0-8272-7f0194ae8142.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f95f/live/13607840-9b00-11f0-8272-7f0194ae8142.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f95f/live/13607840-9b00-11f0-8272-7f0194ae8142.jpg.webp\" alt=\"A bespectacled man looks ahead, standing in front of a winding river in a mountain valley\" /></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Marut Vanyan stands close to the Aras river that separates Armenia from Iran</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>A future Trump route promises both \"unimpeded connectivity\" for Azerbaijan and \"full respect\" for Armenia's sovereignty.

    "body": "10 hours agoRegan MorrisSanta Ana, California ReutersRyan Wedding appeared in a Santa Ana court on Monday Former Olympic snowboarder Ryan Wedding has pleaded not guilty to all 17 felony charges against him including drug trafficking, witness tampering and conspiracy to commit murder.In his first court appearance since being arrested in Mexico last week, Wedding appeared relaxed, smiling with his attorney and occasionally at the media and FBI agents as he stretched his unshackled arms. Wedding was on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list for allegedly running a transnational drug cartel, importing millions of dollars' worth of cocaine into Los Angeles and distributing it to Canada and across the US. He is also accused of orchestrating the murder of a man who planned to testify against him.US officials have alleged the 44-year-old was living in Mexico under the Sinaloa drug cartel's protection.Wedding, who wore a tan prison jumper over an orange shirt and socks, told Judge John Early on Monday that he had read the two indictments against him and understood his rights. His attorney did not request bail, but said they may do so at another date.A Canadian national who competed in snowboarding at the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City, Wedding still looks like an athlete – an imposing figure at 1.91m (6ft 3in) and 109 kg (240 pounds). Some journalists expressed surprise that his wrists were not shackled.US officials have not provided details of Wedding's arrest in Mexico, but his lawyer Anthony Colombo disputed reports from Mexican officials that Wedding had turned himself in.\"That is a false narrative,\" Colombo told the BBC outside the courthouse.He appeared in court in Santa Ana in Orange County, instead of Los Angeles, as his appearance was moved due to ongoing protests  outside the LA federal building against federal immigration operations. Wedding is next due in court in Los Angeles on 9 February. Previously described as a \"modern-day iteration of Pablo Escobar\" by FBI director Kash Patel, the agency says Wedding's aliases include \"El Jefe,\" \"Giant,\" \"Public Enemy,\" \"James Conrad King,\" and \"Jesse King\". Officials allege that he launched his criminal enterprise following his release from a US federal prison in 2011, where he was serving a sentence for cocaine distribution.He is alleged to have ordered dozens of murders across the globe, including in the US, Canada and Latin America.Officials say he had been living in luxury in Mexico as the search for him by both US and Canadian police ramped up. Late last year, the FBI released photos of Wedding's motorcycle collection they seized in Mexico, which they say is worth about $40m (£29m). In November, RCMP Commissioner Michael Duheme said seven Canadians allegedly linked to the cartel had been arrested and would be extradited to the US.",

    "body": "Australian authorities have issued heatwave warnings for most of the country as millions mark the national holiday, Australia Day.Temperatures are expected to peak on Tuesday, reaching the \"high forties\" Celsius in the southern states of Victoria and South Australia, the Bureau of Meteorology said.On Sunday, South Australia recorded temperatures as high as 48.5C, the bureau reported. Fire danger warnings are in place across the country.Some Australia Day events on Monday were cancelled out of safety concerns.In Adelaide, a parade and light show were cancelled because of the extreme heat forecast.\"While this is deeply disappointing for the community, performers and partners, community safety and wellbeing must come first,\" organisers said.Australia Day - 26 January - is the anniversary of the 1788 landing of Britain's First Fleet, which began the era of colonisation.But to many people, especially Indigenous Australians, the occasion is a reminder of their cultural destruction under European settlers - referring to the occasion as \"Invasion Day\". Across the country on Monday, huge crowds gathered for rallies in support of Indigenous Australians.Aside from Victoria and South Australia, heatwave warnings have also been issued in New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania, Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory.Many of these warnings will remain in place until Wednesday.\"We haven't seen heatwave conditions like this in Victoria for almost 20 years,\" Tim Wiebusch, Victoria's emergency management commissioner, told ABC.\"It was 2009 ahead of the bushfires where we saw those prevailing conditions and so we are indicating to all Victorians that this is a very serious set of weather conditions.\"On Monday, the Bureau of Meteorology warned of \"extreme fire dangers\" across parts of South Australia and much of south-western Victoria \"due to very hot and dry weather combined with moderate to gusty winds\".Firefighters in Victoria are working to combat several fires across the state, which have prompted evacuations and threatened properties.The heat has also affected the Australian Open at Melbourne Park. Tennis player Jannik Sinner was seen suffering from cramps on the court on Saturday, before play was temporarily suspended in the rising heat. Nearly 80,000 fans were warned to take care under the scorching sun. Meanwhile, parts of Western Australia were pummelled by Tropical Cyclone Luana over the weekend. The storm damaged homes and a popular beach resort before weakening as it moved inland. The meteorological bureau has advised people to find places to keep cool, like their homes, libraries, community centres or shopping centres. It also told people to close their windows and draw the curtains to keep heat out of their homes.",

    "body": "10 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentReggae legend Sly Dunbar, who played with everyone from Bob Marley to The Rolling Stones, has died at the age of 73.One of the genre's most revered drummers, he played on tracks such as Bob Marley's Punky Reggae Party and Dave and Ansell Collins' classic, Double Barrel.However, he was better known as half of the production team Sly & Robbie - who produced groundbreaking hits for everyone from Peter Tosh and Black Uhuru, to non-reggae acts like Bob Dylan, Grace Jones and Ian Dury.Dunbar's death was first reported by his wife, Thelma, who told the Jamaican newspaper The Gleaner she had found him unresponsive on Monday morning. The musician's agent and publicist confirmed the news to the BBC. Born Lowell Fillmore Dunbar in Kingston, Jamaica, he started out playing on tin cans, after watching Lloyd Knibbs and the Skatalites on television.\"I saw [Knibbs] playing and I thought, 'I want to be a drummer' because he's the hardest worker in the band,\" he said in a 1997 interview.\"He's my idol! In some ways, I'm self-taught but I got a lot of help from other drummers by watching them play.\"In his teens, Dunbar met bassist Robbie Shakespeare and formed the rhythm section of the Revolutionaries, who became regular session musicians at the famed Channel One recording studio.Their sound differed from the melody-rich music of Bob Marley, with a heavier emphasis on the beat - including the pioneering \"rockers\" rhythm, which introduced more syncopation and energy to the music.They spent the 1970s working with major reggae acts like Gregory Isaacs, Dennis Brown and Barrington Levy, while touring the US with Peter Tosh.According to legend, the duo lived on bread and water in that period, hoping to save enough money to start their own production company.Taxi Records was duly founded in 1980, and nurtured a new generation of Jamaican artists such as Shaggy, Shabba Ranks, Skip Marley, Beenie Man and Red Dragon.Around the same time, they provided the thunderous beats on Grace Jones's hit 1981 album Nightclubbing, which opened the doors for them to work with some of rock and pop's greatest - from Dylan and Joe Cocker, to singers like Marianne Faithfull, Madonna and Sinead O'Connor.At home, they earned a reputation for updating the sound of reggae by incorporating more electronic instruments and textures.Later on, they developed a bright and melodic take on dancehall with the duo Chaka Demus & Pliers, scoring hits with songs such as Tease Me and Murder She Wrote in the early 1990s.At one point, Shakespeare (who died in 2021) estimated that he and Dunbar had taken part in more than 200,000 recordings, either their own or as backup musicians or producers for other artists.\"When you buy a reggae record, there's a 90% chance the drummer is Sly Dunbar,\" producer Brian Eno told the New Music New York festival in 1979. \"You get the impression that Sly Dunbar is chained to a studio seat somewhere in Jamaica, but in fact what happens is that his drum tracks are so interesting, they get used again and again.\"Dunbar's wife said she had found him unresponsive in bed at around 07:00 on Monday, 26 January.\"I went to wake him up and he wasn't responding, I called the doctor and that was the news,\" she said. An exact cause of death was not given, though Dunbar had reportedly been ill for some time.\"Yesterday was such a good day for him,\" Thelma told Jamaica's Gleaner newspaper. \"He had friends come over to visit him and we all had such a good time. He ate well yesterday... sometimes he's not into food. I knew he was sick... but I didn't know that he was this sick.\"Among those paying tribute was British DJ David Rodigan, who called Dunbar a \"true icon\" and \"one of the greatest drummers of all time\".",

    "body": "At least 11 people were killed and another dozen injured when gunmen opened fire on locals who had gathered at a football pitch in the city of Salamanca in central Mexico on Sunday.Witnesses said armed men arrived at the grounds in several vehicles and shot at those gathered there seemingly indiscriminately.Many families had stayed behind to socialise after a match between local clubs. At least one woman and one child were among those killed.The motive behind the shooting is not yet clear. Guanajuato, the state in which Salamanca is located, registered the highest number of murders in the whole of Mexico last year.Neighbours reported hearing at least 100 shots ring out as the gunmen opened fire at the Cabañas pitch in the Loma de Flores neighbourhood.Local and federal security forces are now investigating the deadly shooting.It came just a day after several violent incidents in the city, in which a total of five men were killed and another was abducted. Guanajuato has seen a spike in violence committed by a number of gangs that engage in the theft of oil and fuel, as well as other criminal activities such as drug trafficking and extortion. Gang members frequently hold up tanker trucks carrying oil and tap oil pipelines belonging to state-run oil company Pemex.Salamanca, which is home to a major Pemex refinery, has been particularly subjected to violent gang-related attacks.Analysts say that the rivalry between the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and the Cartel de Santa Rosa de Lima (CSRL) is behind many of the most brutal incidents.Their criminal activities are not confined to Mexico, with both the smuggling of stolen fuel and illicit drugs spreading violence into the United States.Last year, the US State Department designated the CJNG as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation and, more recently, placed sanctions on the CSRL.US President Donald Trump has made the fight against criminal gangs sending illicit drugs such as heroin, fentanyl, methamphetamines and cocaine one of his priorities. He has in the past alleged that \"cartels are running Mexico\" and has threatened to hit \"narco-terrorists\" with land strikes.The US has already carried out at least 36 strikes against vessels allegedly transporting drugs by sea, both in the Caribbean and the Pacific, killing at least 125 people.Legal experts and Trump's critics have questioned the legality of these strikes. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum last week handed over 37 \"high-impact\" suspects to the US in what local media described as an attempt by her government to co-operate with US counternarcotic efforts and thereby ward off the possibility of Trump ordering unilateral strikes against the cartels in Mexican territory.",

    "body": "A Tokyo court has asked Pyongyang to pay 88 million Japanese yen ($570,000; £416,000) to four people who were lured to North Korea decades ago by a propaganda scheme.The plaintiffs said the North was marketed to them as \"paradise on Earth\", but they instead found themselves subject to harsh conditions, including forced labour. They later escaped. Monday's ruling is largely symbolic with no real way to enforce it: North Korea has for years ignored the lawsuit, and its leader Kim Jong Un has not responded to Japanese court summons.But the ruling, which comes after a years-long legal battle in Japanese courts, has been hailed by the plaintiffs' lawyer as \"historic\".This was the first time \"a Japanese court exercised its sovereignty against North Korea to recognise its malpractice\", said Atsushi Shiraki, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, AFP reported.More than 90,000 Zainichi Koreans - ethnic Koreans who live in Japan - moved to North Korea between 1959 and 1984, under a resettlement scheme which promised an idyllic life of free healthcare, education and jobs. But instead survivors say they found themselves forced to work on farms and factories, subject to restrictions and could not leave.One of the plaintiffs, Eiko Kawasaki, went to North Korea in 1960, when she was 17. She escaped in 2003 and is now 83 years old.She was among a group of five plaintiffs who filed a lawsuit in 2018 demanding compensation. Two of the original plaintiffs have since died, but one of them continued to be represented in the lawsuit by their family.In 2022, a Tokyo district court rejected their compensation claims, saying that it fell outside Japanese jurisdiction and the statute of limitations had expired.But in 2023, the Tokyo High Court ruled that the case was in fact under Japanese jurisdiction and found that North Korea had violated the plaintiffs' rights.\"It's not an overstatement to say most of their lives were ruined by North Korea,\" judge Taiichi Kamino said at a ruling at the Tokyo District Court on Monday,  according to an Associated Press report. Kenji Fukuda, another lawyer for the plaintiffs acknowledged the significance of the ruling but said it would be a \"challenge\" actually getting any money from North Korea. ",

The lone survivor of the crash was a member of the flight crew. The incident came as a dangerous winter storm barrelled across a large swathe of the US, killing several people and leaving hundreds of thousands without power. Pilots had reportedly been struggling with visibility at the airport before the crash.Bangor remains under a winter storm warning until Tuesday, with heavy snowfall forecast.Follow live updates on the US winter storm hereIn a short report issued on Monday, the FAA said that the jet carrying eight people \"crashed under unknown circumstances on departure\" on Sunday evening.The statement added that the aircraft \"came to rest inverted and caught fire\".Bangor International Airport said following the incident that it had closed and that emergency crews were responding. The incident remains under investigation, and officials have not released the identities of the victims.Public records show that the plane is registered to a law firm in Houston, Texas.Audio from air traffic control, reported by the BBC's US partner CBS News and published by LiveATC.net, captured discussions between controllers and pilots minutes before the crash concerning poor visibility, though it was unclear which aircraft were heard in the communications.Shortly afterwards, a controller was heard saying there was \"a passenger aircraft upside down\". Images from the scene showed smoke and flames on the runway.The disruption came amid widespread travel chaos due to the storm, with more than 11,000 flights cancelled and nearly 5,500 delayed across the US on Sunday, according to tracker FlightAware. Airports in Philadelphia, Washington DC, Baltimore, North Carolina, New York and New Jersey were among those affected.Between 10 and 16 inches (25-40cm) of snow is forecast to accumulate in parts of Maine, including Bangor, by Tuesday morning, according to the National Weather Service.",

    "body": "51 minutes agoAyeshea PereraAsia Digital EditorFirefighters in the Australian state of Victoria are battling at least six major fires as a record-breaking heatwave hits the country's south-east. Two fires are currently burning at \"emergency level\" according to local broadcaster ABC News. Several communities have been issued emergency warnings to either evacuate, watch and wait, or shelter in place. Fire officials warn that the situation is changing rapidly and have asked locals to stay up to date with the latest warnings.The Bureau of Meteorology says that parts of the state have seen all-time temperature highs - with one area hitting a high of 48.9C. Melbourne has recorded a temperature of 41C. Chris Hardman, the chief fire officer at Forest Fire Management Victoria, had told reporters that the state's heat conditions were making conditions \"incredibly difficult\" for firefighters.Two fires - in Camperdown and Otways - are burning at emergency level. A new fire in the Larralea area is also causing \"significant concern\". Country Fire Authority (CFA) chief officer Jason Hefferman told ABC Radio that there was a danger that the Otways fire could produce ember showers \"which can create more fires in front of the main fire\". It is unclear what damage has been caused by the fires, but Australia's Deputy Incident Controller Alistair Drayton, said he had \"anecdotal evidence\" that some homes had been lost. He also praised the \"spectacular\" work done by firefighters so far. Apart from Victoria, where there is a total fire ban, South Australia has also been placed under alert for \"extreme\" fire risk.Meanhwile health officials have warned that the prolonged heat carries significant health risks. The elderly, children and people with underlying health conditions are most at risk,  Victoria chief health officer Caroline McElnay told reporters.\"It can cause potentially fatal health problems such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke but it can also trigger events like heart attacks or stroke.\"",

    "body": "Technology giant Meta is set to trial premium subscriptions for Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp users in the coming months in its latest experiment with paid services.The new offerings would give access to features including expanded artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.Under the plan, access to the platforms' core services would remain free to use.The firm also plans to test subscriptions for features, such as its Vibes video generation app, which the firm says \"can bring your ideas to life with new AI visual creation tools\".Meta announced Vibes in September as part of the latest version of the Meta AI app.It also aims to use Manus, a Chinese-founded AI firm it agreed to buy in December for a reported $2bn (£1.46bn), in its subscription plans, according to TechCrunch, which first reported the story.The company will also continue to offer standalone Manus subscriptions to businesses.At the time, Meta said the deal would help improve its own AI by giving people access to \"agents\" - tools which can do complex things with minimal user interaction such as planning trips or making presentations.\"Manus's exceptional talent will join Meta's team to deliver general-purpose agents across our consumer and business products, including Meta AI,\" it said in a blog post.Based in Singapore after relocating from China, Manus has sought to set itself apart from rival AI developers with what it claims can be a \"truly autonomous\" agent.Unlike many chatbots which need to be repeatedly asked for things before a user can get their desired response, Manus says its service can plan, execute and complete tasks independently in accordance with instructions.In January, Beijing said it would investigate the Meta deal to assess whether it broke China's technology export laws or national security regulations.Last year, Facebook tested placing a limit on how many links some users can share when they post on the social media platform.Notifications seen by some users based in the UK and US said they could only share a certain number of links in Facebook posts without a subscription.The company described it as \"a limited test to understand whether the ability to publish an increased volume of posts with links adds additional value\" for subscribers.In 2023, Meta started to roll out a paid verification service that gives Facebook and Instagram users a blue tick for a monthly fee.",

    "body": "Tearful goodbyes as Japan returns pandas to China amid worsening ties 1 day agoKelly NgandShaimaa Khalil,Tokyo correspondentEPATwin cubs Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei will return to China on TuesdayThousands of people flocked to a zoo in Japan on Sunday to say farewell to the country's last two giant pandas, who are set to return to China on Tuesday.Emotions ran high at the Ueno zoo in Tokyo as people stood in line – some for as long as three-and-a-half hours – to see twin cubs Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei one last time.This comes at a very tense moment in relations between Tokyo and Beijing. Ties have sharply deteriorated after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said Tokyo would get involved militarily if China attacked Taiwan.The twins' departure will leave Japan without any pandas for the first time since 1972, the year the two countries normalised diplomatic ties.The People's Republic of China has used giant pandas as a gesture of goodwill towards its international allies and competitors since it was founded in 1949.But China retains ownership of all pandas it loans to foreign countries, including cubs born abroad. In return, host countries pay an annual fee of about $1m (£790,000) per pair of pandas.According to Tokyo's metropolitan government, some 108,000 people vied to get one of the 4,400 slots available for one last look at the zoo's beloved pandas.\"I have been bringing my son here since he was a baby, so I hope it becomes a good memory for him. I'm glad we could come today to remember them,\" Ai Shirakawa told the BBC.Ai Shirakawa (left) says she has been bringing her son to see the pandas since he was bornAnother woman recalled witnessing the pandas' growth journey. \"Witnessing their growth, especially since they were so small, has been such a joy,\" she said.Some visitors were pictured sobbing as they bade the bears goodbye.Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei were born in 2021 at the Ueno zoo to their mother Shin Shin and their father Ri Ri, both of whom were on loan to Japan for breeding research.More recently, China's panda loans have coincided with major trade agreements. In 2011, the loan of two pandas to Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland was agreed during negotiations over contracts to supply salmon meat, Land Rover vehicles and energy technology to China.Many pandas have been returned to China in recent years – a loan agreement typically lasts 10 years although extensions are common. However, the prospects of a new panda loan to Japan have remained uncertain amid the escalating row.Japanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi's comments on Taiwan angered Beijing which views the self-governed island as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to \"reunite\" with it.Both sides have since engaged in increasingly hostile actions and rhetoric towards each other. Early this month, China tightened restrictions on exports of rare earth-related products to Japan.Getty ImagesSome 108,000 people vied to get one of the 4,400 slots to see the pandas",

    "body": "Judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) have ruled that former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte is fit to attend pre-trial proceedings for alleged crimes against humanity.The ICC also will hold a hearing on 23 February to decide whether the prosecution's case against Duterte is strong enough to proceed to a trial.Duterte's lawyers earlier argued that the 80-year-old was unfit to participate in the ICC proceedings citing \"cognitive impairment\". He has been detained at the Hague since March 2025.He is accused of being responsible for dozens of murders under his so-called war on drugs, during which thousands of small-time drug dealers, users and others were killed without trial.Duterte was president of the Philippines from 2016 to 2022. He justified his war on drugs by saying peace and order would pave the way for economic development.Citing opinions from a panel of medical experts, ICC judges said they were \"satisfied\" that Duterte is \"able effectively to exercise his procedural rights and is therefore fit to take part in the pre-trial proceedings\".ICC judges also said in their decision on Monday that the mental capacities needed to \"meaningfully exercise one's procedural and fair trial rights\" did not have to be \"at their notionally highest level\".\"This ruling tells victims that in the reckoning of Duterte at the ICC, their voices will not be sidelined by technical evasions,\" said Congresswoman Leila de Lima, one of Duterte's fiercest critics who was jailed during his presidency on drug charges that were later found to be false.Duterte was arrested at Manila airport in March 2025 as his family's alliance with his successor, President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr crumbled.His arrest has divided Filipinos. While his deadly drugs crackdown has drawn sharp criticism from civil society, his populist message resonates with those who feel sidelined by Manila's political elite.In May last year, Duterte was elected mayor of Davao city despite being in prison. His daughter, Vice-President Sara Duterte, is also widely expected to run for president in the 2028 elections, where Marcos is ineligible to seek a second term.",

    "body": "Nipah virus outbreak in India triggers Asia airport screenings19 minutes agoKelly NgEPAThe Nipah virus can spread from animals to humans.An outbreak of the deadly Nipah virus in India's West Bengal state has sparked concern in parts of Asia, with some tightening screening measures at airports.Thailand has started screening passengers at three airports that receive flights from West Bengal. Nepal has also begun screening arrivals at Kathmandu airport and other land border points with India.Five healthcare workers in West Bengal were infected by the virus early this month, one of whom is in a critical condition. Some 110 people who were in contact with them have been quarantined.The virus can spread from animals to humans. It has a high death range – ranging from 40% to 75% – as there is no vaccine or medicine to treat it.What is the Nipah virus and what are its symptoms?The Nipah virus can be transmitted from animals, like pigs and fruit bats, to humans. It can also  spread person-to-person through contaminated food.The World Health Organization has described Nipah in its top ten priority diseases, along with pathogens like Covid-19 and Zika, because of its potential to trigger an epidemic.The incubation period ranges from four to 14 days.People who contract the virus show a wide range of symptoms, or sometimes, none at all.Initial symptoms may include fever, headaches, muscle pain, vomiting and sore throat. In some people, these may be followed by drowsiness, altered consciousness, and pneumonia.Encephalitis, a sometimes-fatal condition that causes inflammation of the brain, may occur in severe cases.To date, no drugs of vaccines have been approved to treat the disease. Where were the past outbreaks?The first recognised Nipah outbreak was in 1998 among pig farmers in Malaysia and later spread to neighbouring Singapore. The virus got its name from the village where it was first discovered.More than 100 people were killed and a million pigs culled in an effort to contain the virus. It also resulted in significant economic losses for farmers and those in the livestock trade.Bangladesh has borne the brunt in recent years, with more than 100 people dying of Nipah since 2001.The virus has also been detected in India. Outbreaks were reported in West Bengal in 2001 and 2007. More recently, the southern state of Kerala has been a Nipah hotspot. In 2018, 19 cases were reported of which 17 were fatal; and in 2023, two out of six confirmed cases later died.What is happening now?At least five confirmed cases were reported as of last week, all of whom were linked to a private hospital in Barasat. Two nurses are being treated in an intensive coronary care unit, one of whom remains in \"very critical\" condition, local media reported citing the state's health department.No cases have yet been reported outside India, but several countries are stepping up precautions. On Sunday, Thailand started screening passengers at three international airports in Bangkok and Phuket that receive flights from West Bengal. Passengers from these flights have been asked to make health declarations.The parks and wildlife department has also implemented stricter screenings in natural tourist attractions.Jurai Wongswasdi, a spokeswoman for the Department for Disease Control, told BBC Thai authorities are \"fairly confident\" about guarding against an outbreak in Thailand. Nepal, too, has begun screening people arriving through the airport in Kathmandu and other land border points with India.Meanwhile, health authorities in Taiwan have proposed to list the Nipah virus as a \"Category 5 disease\". Under the island's system, diseases classified as Category 5 are emerging or rare infections with major public health risks, that require immediate reporting and special control measures.Additional reporting by BBC Thai",

    "body": "11 hours agoMerlyn Thomas,BBC VerifyandShayan Sardarizadeh,BBC VerifyVerified videos emerging from Iran show bodies piled up in a hospital, snipers stationed on buildings and CCTV cameras being destroyed, following the unprecedented crackdown on protests earlier this month.BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they first erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the state's deadly crackdown on protesters.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has confirmed the killing of nearly 6,000 people, including 5,633 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December. It says it is also currently investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks.Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people were killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".The latest videos to emerge from the country are understood to have been filmed on 8 and 9 January, when thousands of people took to the streets following a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah.They are thought to be the deadliest nights for protesters so far and these newly verified videos show how Iran's security forces have been violently cracking down on protesters.Multiple clips analysed by BBC Verify and BBC Persian show bodies piled up inside a mortuary at Tehranpars hospital in east Tehran. We verified the location of the hospital by matching its interior to other publicly available images and videos of the building, and counted at least 31 bodies in just one video. Another clip shows seven body bags laid on the ground outside the hospital's entrance.Hundreds of people are seen protesting on a highway in west Tehran in another video before multiple rounds of gunfire can be heard and people begin to scream. Protesters have also been seen trying to evade Iran's heavy surveillance infrastructure by disabling CCTV cameras. Footage we verified shows one person in the capital climbing up a post and hitting a surveillance camera several times in an attempt to disable it. A huge crowd of protesters can be seen on the ground and heard cheering as the camera is damaged.We have tracked the spread of the anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely far higher.In the south-eastern city of Kerman a video taken from high up in a building shows several armed men in military uniform walking down a road firing their weapons continuously, though it is not clear who they are shooting at. A small fire burns in the middle of the road while the sound of protesters chanting can be heard in the background.Snipers have also been recorded on the roofs of buildings. In the north-eastern city of Mashhad verified video shows two men dressed in black on a rooftop of a building in daylight. One man is standing next to a large rifle that is lent against a wall and speaking on the phone. The other man crouches on the floor while smoking.For most people there has been an almost-total internet blackout since 8 January, but some have managed to briefly access the internet using methods such as SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet and virtual private networks (VPNs).More videos are likely to emerge in the coming days as the country's economy has struggled during the blackout.Additional reporting BBC Persian.",

At least a dozen people have been killed in several US states. Some areas in the northeast saw over 20 inches (50.8 cm) of snow in the last 24 hours, according to the National Weather Service (NWS), and Canadian officials said the storm has seriously disrupted southern Ontario.Forecasters warn another \"significant winter storm\" could hit the eastern US again this weekend.More than 200,000 people had lost power in Tennessee as of Monday afternoon. The city experienced a deep freeze that plunged residents into cold and darkness.\"There are many trees down and power lines blocking the roads.\" Joy Flores, vice president of the Nashville Rescue Mission homeless shelter, told the BBC. Her centre was taking calls from residents who had lost power.The roads were icy and impossible to navigate, Flores said, and own her home had \"no heating, no internet, and no coffee\".In New York City, a total of eight people had died between Friday and Monday morning, according to city officials, as temperatures plummeted into the single digits.New York City's Central Park registered 11.4 inches of snow as of Monday morning, according to the NWS.In Texas, a teenage girl died and another was in critical condition due to a sledding accident, the Frisco Police Department announced.In North Carolina, a man was found dead on the side of a highway in Buncombe County and authorities are investigating whether his death was weather-related. And Louisiana's department of health said that two people had died due to hypothermia.Getty ImagesCity crews pile snow outside New York City Hall. Massachusetts Governor Maura Healy warned the state's residents on Monday that \"it's not over yet\", and one to five inches of snowfall was expected on Monday.In Canada, Ottawa and Quebec saw the heaviest impacts from the storm, leading to transportation issues and multiple school closures.Toronto Pearson Airport received 18.1 inches (46 cm) of snow fall on Sunday, a new record for the site, according to the CBC.On Monday, US airline customers continued to experience frustrations and delayed. Airlines experienced over 19,000 delays on Monday, according to FlightAware, and 5,900 cancellations.Relief may not come soon. According to the NWS, the \"potential is increasing\" for another winter storm beginning on Friday. Such an event could bring very cold temperatures across the eastern US, and \"widespread heavy precipitation\".The US weather agency cautioned that forecasters did not yet know the potential path of the storm or where it would have the most impact.Additional reporting by Gabriela PomeroyAnadolu via Getty ImagesA resident walks through deep snow piles in Toronto, Canada.",

    "body": "5 hours agoDearbail JordanandPeter HoskinsUS President Donald Trump has announced he is raising tariffs on South Korean imports to 25% after accusing Seoul of \"not living up\" to a trade deal reached last year.In a post on social media, Trump said he would increase levies on South Korea from 15% across a range of products including automobiles, lumber, pharmaceuticals and \"all other Reciprocal TARIFFS\".Trump said South Korean lawmakers have been slow to approve the deal while \"we have acted swiftly to reduce our TARIFFS in line with the Transaction agreed to\".South Korea says it had not been given official notice of the decision to raise tariffs on some of its goods, and wanted urgent talks with Washington over the issue.It added that South Korea's Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan, who is currently in Canada, will visit Washington as soon as possible to meet US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.South Korea's benchmark Kospi stock index fell on Tuesday morning but was trading about 1.8% higher later in the day as shares in major exporters recovered.Seoul and Washington reached a deal last October, which included a pledge from South Korea to invest $350bn (£256bn) in the US, some of which would go to shipbuilding.The following month, the two countries agreed that the US would reduce tariffs on some products once South Korea started the process to approve the deal.The agreement was submitted to South Korea's National Assembly on 26 November and is currently being reviewed. It is likely to be passed in February, according to local media.Tariffs are paid by companies who import products. In this case, US firms will pay a 25% tax on goods they buy from South Korea.Trump has frequently used tariffs as leverage to enact foreign policy during his second term in the White House.On Saturday, he threatened Canada with a 100% tariff if it struck a trade deal with China.On Monday, Chinese officials said its \"strategic partnership\" agreement with Canada is not meant to undercut other countries.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said his country was not pursuing a free trade deal with China and has \"never\" considered it.He added that Canadian officials have made their position clear to their American counterparts.Before that, Trump said he would impose import taxes on eight countries - including the UK - who opposed US plans to seize Greenland, an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark which is a member of Nato.He later backed down from the tariff threat over Greenland citing progress towards a \"future deal\" over the island, but the episode strained US relations with Denmark and other Nato allies.

    "body": "13 hours agoChris EwokorBBC Africa, AbujaA group of officers in Nigeria are set to face a military court after being accused of \"plotting to overthrow the government\" of President Bola Tinubu last year, an armed forces' statement has said.Sixteen officers were arrested last October after what were described as \"acts of indiscipline and breaches of service regulations\".At the time the military dismissed rumours of an attempted coup, but following an investigation, the authorities have acknowledged that some of the 16 will go before a military judicial panel.Nigeria has a complex history of military involvement in politics, with multiple coups between 1966 and 1993, which has made allegations of coup‑plotting highly sensitive.It is not clear how many of the 16 will go on trial, but the military authorities said the process would ensure accountability and uphold \"the principles of fairness and due process\".A statement added that trying to unseat the elected government was \"inconsistent with the ethics, values and professional standards\" of the military.In recent years, concerns over instability, insecurity and public frustration have occasionally prompted rumours about dissent within the ranks - rumours the military has repeatedly dismissed.Nigeria has experienced a period of unbroken civilian rule since 1999. The armed forces have consistently stressed their loyalty to civilian authority, often issuing public statements reaffirming their commitment to democracy.This latest development comes at a time when the West African region has experienced a resurgence of coups. Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Guinea have all seen their governments toppled by soldiers since the beginning of the decade. However, Guinea recently returned to a democratic rule with the junta leader, Mamadi Doumbouya elected president.These events have created heightened vigilance among governments in the region, including Nigeria, which has traditionally positioned itself as a stabilising force within the regional grouping Ecowas.Within Nigeria, the military continues to face intense operational pressures - from fighting militant jihadist groups in the north-east to tackling criminals and communal violence across the north‑west and central states.Analysts say such pressures, combined with resource constraints and public scrutiny, have put the spotlight on discipline within the armed forces.",

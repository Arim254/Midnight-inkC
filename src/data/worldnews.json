    "body": "France's highest court has upheld a sentence against former French President Nicolas Sarkozy over the illegal financing of his 2012 re-election campaign.He was found guilty of overspending on his campaign, then hiring a PR firm named Bygmalion to cover it up.Sarkozy, 70, was handed the one-year sentence in 2024 of which six months were suspended, meaning they could be served by wearing an electronic tag instead of going to jail.He has always denied all allegations. Prosecutors in the case said Sarkozy's UMP party spent nearly double the €22.5m (£19.4m) cap on his campaign, splurging on lavish campaign rallies and events.To hide the costs, UMP then asked Bygmalion to invoice the party, rather than the campaign.Today's is the second definitive conviction for the former president, who was in power from 2007 to 2012.Last December the High Court of Appeal upheld a corruption conviction and Sarkozy had to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet for six months.Then, in September, he was sentenced to five years in jail after being found guilty of criminal conspiracy.He spent 20 days in jail before he was released earlier in November. An appeal trial will be held next year. Until then Sarkozy will be subject to strict judicial supervision and barred from leaving France.Days after his release, Sarkozy's team announced the former president was writing a book about his three weeks in jail, titled \"A prisoner's diary\". An excerpt from the book was published on social media: \"In prison there is nothing to see, and nothing to do. I forget the silence that does not exist at La Santé [prison], where there is much to listen to. Here, the noise is, unfortunately, constant. But - like in the desert - inner life strengthens in jail.\"",

    "body": "A Chicago man who allegedly doused a woman in gasoline and lit her on fire on 17 November was a \"career criminal\", the White House has said. Lawrence Reed who was arrested for the crime had 72 prior arrests that include eight felony convictions and seven misdemeanours, according to the White House. The victim, 26-year-old Bethany MaGee, survived the attack but is \"now fighting for her life with horrific burns\", the White house said in a statement.In court on Monday, Mr Reed yelled three times in succession \"I'm guilty\", after the judge warned he could receive a life sentence for charges that include committing a terrorist attack, according to reports from inside the courtroom. The White House has sought to blame the incident on Democrats' policies on crime, casting them as \"soft\". Both the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago are led by Democrats, and President Donald Trump is currently seeking to withhold federal funds from Illinois over its elimination of \"cash bail\", where an arrested person posts a sum of money to be released from jail before trial.The suspect \"was walking free because of the radical, dangerous 'no cash bail' law proudly signed by Governor JB Pritzker and celebrated by Chicago's defund-the-police Mayor Brandon Johnson\", the White House said in a statement it released on Tuesday. Mayor Johnson said in a statement that the attack \"was a tragic incident, and the Mayor's prayers are with the victim and her family.\"Mr Reed, 50, has a history of mental illness and has been arrested 72 times since he turned 18, according to a Chicago affiliate of the BBC's partner CBS News.In August, he was charged with aggravated battery for allegedly hitting a social worker and after his arrest was released with electronic monitoring against prosecutors' objections. The attack against Ms MaGee happened while she was \"minding her own business and reading her phone\", prosecutors said. According to the criminal complaint, she was approached by Mr Reed arriving from the back of the train car who then doused her with gasoline before she ran.As he chased her, the complaint said, Mr Reed ignited the rest of the liquid in the bottle and set Ms MaGee on fire. Footage of the incident appeared to show Mr Reed watching Ms MaGee as she rolled on the floor engulfed in flames attempting to extinguish the fire. Last week,  Mayor Johnson said the attack \"should have never happened\", characterising it as \"an absolute failure of our criminal justice as well as our mental health institutions\". He said the suspect clearly faced mental health challenges and presented a danger to himself and the community.As a county commissioner, Johnson in 2020 introduced a nonbinding resolution to redirect funds from police and jails to other public services, but while running for mayor in 2023 he promised not to cut police spending.",

    "body": "8 hours agoJon Donnison,BBC News, JerusalemandTom McArthur,BBC NewsWatch: Mohammed Ibrahim, 16, reunites with family after release from Israeli jailA Palestinian-American teenager who spent nine months in Israeli detention without charge has been freed.Mohammed Ibrahim was 15 when he was arrested in February in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where he was visiting on holiday from Florida, for allegedly throwing stones at Jewish settlers, which he previously denied.The US state department said it welcomed the news of Mohammed's release.The BBC has contacted the Israeli authorities but has not received a reply.Mohammed, now 16, was taken to hospital for treatment immediately after release, relatives told the media. They said he is, pale, underweight and is suffering from conditions contracted in captivity.In a statement, Mohammed's uncle spoke of the family's \"immense relief\". Zeyad Kadur said the family had been \"living a horrific and endless nightmare\" over the last nine months.\"Right now, we are focused on getting Mohammed the immediate medical attention he needs after being subjected to Israel's abuse and inhumane conditions for months. We just want Mohammed to be healthy and to have his childhood back,\" he said.\"Israeli soldiers had no right to take Mohammed from us in the first place,\" he added.The state department said it would continue to provide consular support to Mohammed's family. \"The Trump Administration has no higher priority than the safety and security of US citizens,\" it added.Earlier this week Mohammed's father Zahar Ibrahim told the BBC he was frustrated that the US government was not doing more to get his son out of jail.Twenty-seven US lawmakers had signed a letter to the state department and President Donald Trump, demanding more be done to release him.Mr Ibrahim, a father-of-four who runs an ice cream business in Florida, previously said his son only confessed to throwing stones because the soldiers beat him.He had not seen or spoken to Mohammed since February, and only heard what had happened to him in detention through court documents.Mohammed was held without charge in Ofer prison on the West Bank. It is also home to adult prisoners, some of whom have been convicted of serious terrorism offences and murder.There are around 350 Palestinian child security detainees being held in Israeli jails, according to the Israeli Prison Service.Many have never been charged and human rights groups, as well as the United Nations, say some have suffered abuse and torture.Following Mohammed's release, Mr Kadur said the family would also continue fighting for justice for his cousin Sayfollah Musallet, a 20-year-old dual US citizen who the Palestinian health ministry said was beaten to death by Israeli settlers during a confrontation in July. At the time the Israeli military said authorities were looking into reports a Palestinian civilian had been killed.Mohammed and Sayfollah had worked together in the family ice cream shop in Tampa, Florida. No one has been charged with Sayfollah's killing.\"We expect the American government to protect our families,\" Mr Kadur said.",

    "body": "President Vladimir Putin has doubled down on his core demands for ending the war in Ukraine, saying Russia will lay down arms only if Kyiv's troops withdraw from territory claimed by Moscow.Putin has long pushed for legal recognition of the Ukrainian territories Russia has seized by force. They include the southern Crimean peninsula, annexed in 2014, and the eastern Donbas region, which Moscow now occupies for the most part.For Kyiv, which has ruled out relinquishing the parts of the Donbas it still holds, rewarding Russia for its aggression is a non-starter.Speaking after Putin's address, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia \"scorned\" efforts \"to truly end the war\".Speaking to reporters during a trip to Kyrgyzstan, Putin accused Kyiv of wanting to fight \"to the last Ukrainian\" - which he said Russia was \"in principle\" also ready to do. He repeated his view that Russia has the initiative on the battlefield and the fighting would only end when Ukrainian troops withdrew from Donbas, which is made up of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.\"If they don't withdraw, we'll achieve this by force of arms,\" he said.Yet Russia's slow gains in eastern Ukraine have come at significant cost of manpower. According to the US-based Institute for the Study of War, at this rate it would take Moscow almost two more years to seize the rest of the Donetsk region. Thursday's remarks were the first time that Putin addressed the hectic diplomatic moves of the last week, which saw the US and Ukraine hold intense discussions over a peace plan reportedly drafted in October by American and Russian officials.The plan, which was heavily slanted towards Moscow's demands, was subsequently revised during talks between Ukrainian and US negotiators in Geneva. European representatives were also in the Swiss city.But it is thought it does not address the issue of the occupied territories which - alongside security guarantees for Ukraine - is the biggest sticking point between Moscow and Kyiv.Putin said that new draft plan has now been shown to Russia, and that it could become the \"basis\" for a future agreement to end the war.However, he added it was \"absolutely necessary\" to discuss \"certain specific points that need to be put in diplomatic language\".Asked about the possibility of Crimea and the Donbas being recognised as under Russian de facto control but not legally, Putin said: \"This is the point of our discussion with our American counterparts\".A US delegation including special envoy Steve Witkoff was expected in Moscow in the first half of next week, he confirmed. US President Donald Trump told reporters that Witkoff may be joined in Moscow by the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner.Zelensky said in a video address late on Thursday that Ukrainian and US delegations would meet \"to translate the points we secured in Geneva into a form that puts us on the path to peace and security guarantees.\" The Ukrainian president did not mention any names, but his chief of staff Andriy Yermak had said US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was due to visit Kyiv later in the week.On Wednesday Trump said there were \"only a few remaining points of disagreement\" between Russia and Ukraine – indicating that any meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss these points was contingent on a peace deal being agreed upon.During his comments to reporters Putin again expressed his contempt for the Ukrainian leadership, which he said he considered illegitimate. There was therefore \"no use\" signing any documents with them, he added.Ukraine has been under martial law since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 and has therefore been unable to hold scheduled elections. Earlier this year, the Ukrainian parliament voted unanimously to affirm the legitimacy of President Zelensky, whose term in office ended in the spring. Putin also dismissed warnings by European leaders that Russia could attack the European continent within the next decades.\"That sounds laughable to us, really,\" he said.The White House and Donald Trump have sounded optimistic about the recent diplomatic push for peace talks, but Europeans have repeatedly expressed their scepticism over whether Putin truly intended to end the war. On Wednesday European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen accused Russia of upholding a post-World War Two mindset and of seeing the European continent as a \"sphere of influence\" in which sovereign nations could be \"carved up\".",

    "body": "Police in Malawi are investigating how four police dogs went missing from a presidential palace in the capital, Lilongwe, during the political transition in September.Godfrey Arthur Jalale, who served as State House deputy chief of staff under former President Lazarus Chakwera, has been arrested in connection with the theft of the four German Shepherds. He denies the charge. Chakwera vacated the palace after losing the elections to President Peter Mutharika. Late on Wednesday, police denied reports that Chakwera had been arrested but confirmed securing a search warrant for his residence after information suggested the stolen dogs were being kept there.Chakwera, who came second with 33% of the vote in the September election, is facing numerous allegations of public resources mismanagement, especially during the handover.His Malawi Congress Party (MCP) has accused Mutharika's administration of  \"harassing and intimidating\" the former leader. Chakwera has not commented.Local media have reported the theft of state property from two presidential residences - the Kamuzu Palace in Lilongwe, and Sanjika Palace, in Blantyre, the country's second biggest city.The four dogs, valued at $2,300 (£1,700), were taken out of the palace between 19 September and 4 October, according to the state prosecutors. In a statement on Wednesday, police said they had \"intensified investigations following reports of property looting\" from Kamuzu Palace.  \"The Malawi Police Service assures the public that the investigation is progressing smoothly,\" it added. MCP MPs boycotted parliamentary sessions on Wednesday and camped out at Chakwera's residence in Lilongwe amid reports that he faced arrest following a heightened police presence, local media reported.Chakwera, a pastor before entering politics, accepted defeat and has kept a low profile since the election. He made his first public appearance last week when he announced that he had accepted a Commonwealth appointment to help mediate in Tanzania's post-election unrest. Mutharika, who first served as president between 2014 and 2020, campaigned on a pledge of a \"return to proven leadership\" - which resonated with Malawian voters. He returned to power in a country that is in deep crisis, with a severe shortage of fuel and foreign currency.The former law professor was rarely seen in public during the campaign, in contrast to Chakwera who held numerous rallies across Malawi.As a result, speculation about Mutharika's health is rife and there are questions about whether he has the stamina to lead Malawi again at the age of 85.",

    "body": "South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has described as \"regrettable\" the announcement by US President Donald Trump that South Africa would not be invited to take part in next year's G20 summit in Florida.In a social media post, Trump said South Africa had refused to hand over the G20 presidency to a US embassy representative at last week's summit in Johannesburg.\"Therefore, at my direction, South Africa will NOT be receiving an invitation to the 2026 G20, which will be hosted in the Great City of Miami, Florida next year.\"Members of the G20 – a gathering of the world's biggest economies - do not need an invite but can possibly be barred through visa restrictions.South Africa's presidential spokesman Vincent Magwenya said they \"should by now accept\" at the highest level of political leadership that \"there won't be a reset of the relationship\" between the two countries despite the efforts they had undertaken.\"If visas are denied, well, then we will have to move on and look beyond the G20 in the US,\" he told the BBC, in response to a question on how they would proceed.He said they were focused on working with other G20 members to carry the momentum of the issues deliberated at the summit in Johannesburg.Trump boycotted the summit because of a widely discredited claim that South Africa's white minority is the victim of large-scale killings and land grabs.Ramaphosa said in a statement that the US had been expected to participate in the G20 meetings, \"but unfortunately, it elected not to attend the G20 Leaders Summit in Johannesburg out of its own volition\". He however noted that some US businesses and civil society entities were present.He said that since the US delegation was not there, \"instruments of the G20 Presidency were duly handed over to a US Embassy official at the Headquarters of South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation\".The low-key handover appears to have further angered Trump, who has been critical of the South African government's domestic and foreign policies.He has in the past claimed that a white genocide was taking place in South Africa, and on Wednesday he said the government was \"killing white people and randomly allowing their farms to be taken from them\".The South African government has consistently rejected such claims as widely discredited and lacking reliable evidence.Ramaphosa said it was regrettable that despite efforts to reset relations with the US, Trump continued \"to apply punitive measures against South Africa based on misinformation and distortions about our country\".In the Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump said South Africa had \"demonstrated to the world they were not a country worthy of membership anywhere\" and announced a stop to \"all payments and subsidies to them, effective immediately\".South African officials have called for solidarity and urged other G20 members to defend the integrity of the gathering and the rights of all its member states.The G20 summit, which was for the first time held in Africa, ended with a joint declaration committing to \"multilateral co-operation\" on climate change mitigation and economic inequality.The declaration was adopted despite objections from the US, which has accused South Africa of weaponising its leadership of the group this year.Additional reporting by Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg",

    "body": "Pope Leo on first foreign trip says future of humanity at stake from conflict13 hours agoAleem MaqboolReligion editor, travelling with Pope Leo XIVAnadolu via Getty ImagesPope Leo (C) was welcomed to Ankara by Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip ErdoganPope Leo XIV has warned that the world should not give into \"a heightened level of conflict on the global level\", at the start of his foreign trip in Turkey.\"The future of humanity is at stake, said the Pope, urging President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to act as a source of stability because of the need to promote dialogue and stability.The Pope will mark a historic Christian anniversary during his visit to Turkey, before heading to Lebanon days after Israeli airstrikes on its capital, Beirut.The visits had been planned by late Pope Francis, but their main theme of building bridges was embraced by Pope Leo from the moment he stepped on the balcony of St Peter's Basilica after his election in May.Leo warned that today's wars were like a \"third world war fought piecemeal\", repeating a phrase that his predecessor had himself used several times, referring to conflicts in Ukraine, Syria, Myanmar and elsewhere. Since he became pontiff six months ago, he has conveyed a sense of being extremely measured, even cautious. But on this trip, his powers of diplomacy will be closely scrutinised.A key moment of the trip will take place in the Turkish town of Iznik, the site of the ancient city of Nicaea. Pope Leo and leaders of other Christian traditions will gather to mark the anniversary of an ancient council that took place there 1,700 years ago.  In 325 AD, among other key decisions, more than 200 bishops at the council affirmed the belief that Jesus was the son of God, eventually leading to what is known as the Nicene Creed.Eastern and Western branches of Christianity later dramatically split, but during this trip there will be messages of togetherness and healing divisions.In Turkey the Pope will also visit the Blue Mosque, as both his immediate predecessors Pope Francis and Pope Benedict XVI had done. He will have meetings with other religious leaders in a gesture of inter-religious dialogue before flying on to the second leg of the trip.EPAThe Pope plans to visit the Blue Mosque in IstanbulThe Vatican says plans for the Pope's visit to Lebanon have not changed following the Israeli airstrikes on Beirut earlier in the week.He will meet more faith leaders and hear from young people in Lebanon, his visit giving a boost in particular to the estimated third of the country that is Christian.On the final day of the trip, Pope Leo will celebrate Mass at the Beirut waterfront at the site of the 2020 port explosion, praying for the more than 200 people who were killed and 7,000 others injured.Over recent months, though he has spoken out on some issues dear to him such as the dignity of migrants, he has certainly not been as overtly political as his predecessor could be.He has walked such a fine line that in some cases both progressives and traditionalists within the Catholic Church have made the case that he supports their school of thought.It was for similar reasons that cardinals of different persuasions were thought to have coalesced around him at conclave.Pope Francis was seen as a visionary but one who was not overly worried about creating consensus, leaving behind a somewhat divided Church. Pope Leo has so far operated very differently, gently holding on to some of the progressive ideals of his predecessor while paying heed to the views of traditionalists.He has repeatedly called for an end to war, but in a different way to Pope Francis, who memorably made daily calls to the Holy Family Church in Gaza to offer his support.ReutersThe Pope met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the Presidential Palace in Ankara on ThursdayIn meetings on this trip - with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Lebanese civic leaders - Pope Leo may be drawn to comment on his views on conflict in the region.We may hear something of his impressions at the end of his trip, as it is customary for the Pope to hold a news conference with travelling press on the return flight to Rome.What we will hear more of on this trip is a pope speaking in a Chicagoan accent. Although Pope Leo, who speaks several languages fluently, has mainly given public addresses in Italian up to this point, the Vatican has confirmed that he will speak English throughout the Turkish leg of his trip, with some French too during his time in Lebanon.",

    "body": "2 days agoHafsa KhalilWatch: Trump says Witkoff doing \"standard negotiation\" in talks with RussiaDonald Trump has defended his special envoy Steve Witkoff as doing the \"standard thing\" after a leaked recording appeared to show him advising a Russian official on how to appeal to the US president.Trump told reporters on Wednesday that he had not heard the audio, but that Witkoff was doing \"what a dealmaker does\" to \"sell\" a US-authored peace plan to both Russia and Ukraine.The leaked call from last month emerged days after the 28-point draft peace plan was presented by the US, which largely reflected Russian positions on ending its full-scale war in Ukraine.Witkoff has visited Moscow several times this year and will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin again next week.He has never gone to Kyiv in his role as special envoy, though other US officials have visited and US army secretary Dan Driscoll went to Kyiv this week. Trump says he will hold further talks with the Ukrainians.Diplomatic talks have continued after the initial draft plan was criticised by Ukrainian and European leaders as being too favourable to Russia. Among the proposals was handing Russia territory in eastern Ukraine currently controlled by Kyiv. The plan has since been revised to better reflect Ukraine's interests and the views of European allies. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he was ready to meet Trump to discuss outstanding \"sensitive points\".In the leaked audio recording obtained and shared as a transcript by Bloomberg, Witkoff appeared to advise Yuri Ushakov, Putin's foreign policy adviser, on how to get on Trump's good side.BBC News has not independently verified the reported 14 October call, but Trump said it represented a \"very standard form of negotiations\". During the leaked conversation, the two men reportedly talked about ending the war, with Ushakov asking if it would be useful to get their bosses - Putin and Trump - to speak.Witkoff is quoted as saying that \"my guy is ready to do it\", before suggesting how to go about the call.\"Just reiterate that you congratulate the president [Trump] on this achievement... that you respect that he is a man of peace and you're just, you're really glad to have seen it happen,\" Witkoff is quoted as saying. \"I think from that it's going to be a really good call.\"\"I told the president that you - that the Russian Federation has always wanted a peace deal. That's my belief,\" Witkoff adds, according to the transcript. \"The issue is is that we have two nations that are having a hard time coming to a compromise.\"He continues: \"I'm even thinking that maybe we set out like a 20-point peace proposal, just like we did in Gaza.\"The call ends with Witkoff telling Ushakov of an imminent Zelensky visit to the White House, and that \"if possible\", Trump and Putin should talk before that meeting.What followed was a two-and-a-half hour phone call between the US and Russian presidents, news of which emerged as Zelensky was on his way to Washington last month.Before the Trump-Putin call, the US president had appeared to be running out of patience with his Russian counterpart and had suggested he might provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles.By the time Zelensky entered the White House, the atmosphere seemed to have changed. Trump said giving Kyiv Tomahawks could escalate the conflict and that he believed Putin \"wants to end the war\".Asked about the call being leaked, Yuri Ushakov told Russian state media that it was done to \"hinder, probably\" and that it was \"unlikely\" to be done to improve relations.He also confirmed that Witkoff would be visiting Moscow next week as per a \"preliminary agreement\".It was not clear who was behind the leak, but Bloomberg has also transcribed another reported call between Ushakov and Putin envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who spent days with Witkoff in Miami in late October weeks before the 28-point draft plan emerged.According to that transcript, Dmitriev tells his Russian colleague: \"We'll just make this paper from our position, and I'll informally pass it along, making it clear that it's all informal. And let them do like their own.\"Apparently angered by the report, Dmitriev complained of a \"well-funded, well-organised malicious media machine built to spread fake narratives, smear opponents and keep people confused\".",

    "body": "13 hours agoNicolas Negoce,Paul Njie,BBC Africa reporters,Natasha BootyandWedaeli ChibelushiAFP via Getty ImagesGen Horta N'Tam, centre, becomes the transitional head of state for one yearAn army general has been sworn in as Guinea-Bissau's new head of state a day after an apparent coup.Gen Horta N'Tam becomes the transitional president for a period of one year. He took the oath on Thursday, in brief and muted proceedings at army headquarters.N'Tam, who until a day earlier had been head of the presidential guard, barely cracked a smile during his swearing-in or while stood outside flanked by officers while for cameras.Some civil society groups in Guinea-Bissau have accused outgoing President Umaro Sissoco Embaló of masterminding a \"simulated coup\" against himself with the help of the military, saying it was a ruse to block election results from coming out in case he lost.\"This manoeuvre aims to prevent the publication of the electoral results scheduled for tomorrow, November 27,\" the civil society coalition Popular Front said in a statement on Wednesday.His closest election rival Fernando Dias has also echoed these claims.But Embaló has not responded to the allegations.He has said he has survived multiple coup attempts during his time in office. However, his critics have previously accused him of fabricating crises in order to crack down on dissent.The military has already suspended the electoral process and blocked the release of the results of Sunday's presidential election which were expected on Thursday.An unnamed military source has told the AFP news agency that Embaló is being held by the army at its staff headquarters, where he is being \"well-treated\".In response to news of the apparent coup, the chair of the African Union (AU) Mahmoud Ali Youssouf demanded \"the immediate and unconditional release of President Embalo and all detained officials\".He also reminded Guinea-Bissau's leaders of \"the imperative of respecting the ongoing electoral process\".Sandwiched between Senegal and Guinea, the West African country is known as a drug-trafficking hub where the military has been influential since independence from Portugal in 1974.Guinea-Bissau has witnessed at least nine coups or attempted coups over the last five decades.AFP via Getty ImagesPresident Umaro Sissoco Embaló has not commented on claims he helped to stage the coup against himThe latest of these, on Wednesday, saw a group of military officers announce they had seized control of the country. Earlier, government sources told the BBC that Embaló had been arrested.Gunshots were heard in the capital, Bissau, but it was not immediately clear who was involved in the shooting or if there were any casualties.The officers then appeared on state TV, saying they had suspended the electoral process. They said they were acting to thwart a plot by unnamed politicians who had \"the support of a well-known drug baron\" to destabilise the country, and announced the closure of its borders and imposed a night-time curfew.The election results were expected on Thursday - both Embaló and his main challenger, Dias, had claimed victory.Dias was supported by former Prime Minister Domingos Pereira, who had been disqualified from running.Late on Wednesday afternoon, Embaló told France 24 in a phone call: \"I have been deposed.\"Government sources later told the BBC that Dias, Pereira and Interior Minister Botché Candé had also been detained.The same sources said the putschists had taken army chief Gen Biague Na Ntan and his deputy, Gen Mamadou Touré, into custody too.Gunshots heard near presidential palace in the capital BissauIn a joint statement, leaders of election observation missions from the African Union and the West African bloc Ecowas expressed \"deep concern with the announcement of a coup d'etat by the armed forces\".They said the country had been prepared for the announcement of the election results after what it described as an \"orderly and peaceful\" process.\"It's regrettable that this announcement came at a time when the missions had just concluded meeting with the two leading presidential candidates, who assured us of their willingness to accept the will of the people,\" they said.Portugal, the country's former colonial ruler, has called for a return to constitutional order, with its foreign ministry urging \"all those involved to refrain from any act of institutional or civic violence\".As of Thursday, the AFP news agency reported that Guinea-Bissau's borders had reopened.Embaló, 53, had wanted to make history as the country's only president to secure a second consecutive mandate in the last 30 years.He had initially said he would not seek a second term. Prior to the delayed polls, his legitimacy was questioned, with the opposition saying his term should have officially ended in February 2025.Guinea-Bissau is one of the poorest countries in the world with a population of more than two million people.Its coastline has many uninhabited islands, making it ideal for drug traffickers - with the UN dubbing it a \"narco-state\" as it has been a key transit point for cocaine coming from Latin America to Europe.

    "body": "US transportation secretary wants more civility in air travel. Not everyone is on boardUS Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is urging air travellers to dress better and be more civil - and it's touching a nerve at a time when many Americans consider air travel more frustrating than ever. Ahead of what's expected to be the busiest Thanksgiving travel season in 15 years, Duffy launched a campaign last week titled \"The Golden Age of Travel Starts with You\", in which he harked back to the 1950s and 60s to call for a return to civility and class in air travel. But as air traffic controllers remain short-staffed and customers face frequent flight delays, both social media users and aviation experts say Duffy is missing the point. A video advert for the Department of Transportation's campaign juxtaposes old footage of smiling airport staff and orderly passengers with modern social media videos of people starting fights on planes, putting their bare feet up on seats and engaging in other disruptive behaviour. \"Manners don't stop at the gate. Things aren't what they used to be,\" Duffy chimes in. \"Let's bring civility and manners back. Ask yourself, are you helping a pregnant woman put her bag in the overhead bin? Are you dressing with respect?\"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) predicts this week will be the busiest Thanksgiving travel season in 15 years - with more than 52,000 flights on 25 November alone. And aviation experts say Duffy's message won't have much effect on the flying atmosphere. Scott Keyes, an air travel expert and founder of the flight deals site Going.com, told the BBC that, while it sounds great to ask everyone to just be nicer to each other, in terms of the actual efficacy of that message, \"you might as well ask a wall to start printing you money\". \"Very few people show up for their flight itching to pick a fight with another passenger,\" Mr Keyes said. And once they reach the level of agitation where they've started picking a fight with a flight attendant or passenger, he said they're unlikely to remember Duffy's words or calm down. The underlying problem, he argues, is people letting their tempers get the best of them, which he sees as a worsening problem across all of society, not just on airplanes, and not just in the US. Since the secretary started posting about the campaign on X, some of his subsequent posts have been flooded with thousands of comments critical of Duffy's message.\"If you want us to be respectful humans at the airport stop treating us like cattle,\" one X user commented. \"Remove the demoralising and humiliating TSA checks (that accomplish nothing) and find a way to get the airlines to give more than 2 inches of space per seat.\"Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and president of Atmosphere Research Group, told the BBC that, while Duffy makes a valid point that being considerate was important, his call to dress nicer won't change a thing. \"You could be dressed in black tie and still be a jerk, and you could be wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt and be the most considerate person in the world. The clothes, in this case, do not make the person,\" Mr Harteveldt said. A number of commenters on Duffy's X post have pointed out that the reason they dress so casually is because of how cramped plane cabins have become, as well as the expectation of extended delays. \"Tell you what,\" one X user commented. \"You get the planes running on time, and we won't dress to spend the night in the damn airport.\" Another wrote: \"Can I get my legroom back?\"One X user, who has nearly 500,000 followers, posted: \"Duffy is absolutely right...BUT our declining travel dress is also a reflection of how airlines treat us. Cattle boarding, tiny seats, penny pinching every beverage cost and just generally miserable.\" Echoing what many social media users have pointed out, Mr Harteveldt said the airlines bore some responsibility for passengers' bad behaviour, too, by making their \"economy cabins so unpleasant and so physically uncomfortable\" that they naturally put passengers in a bad mood. Couple that with minimal flight attendant staffing, minimal amenities on board, and the airlines' embrace of the pay-for-what-you-want business model, \"you don't get people smiling as they walk down the loading bridge to the plane,\" he said. Still, others have praised the secretary's core message of respect and kindness, with one commenting: \"I will do my small part to spread civility in my own life.\"The Department of Transportation (DOT) says the campaign isn't only about saying \"please\" and \"thank you\" - it's also about reducing the amount of violent and disruptive incidents on airplanes and in airports. The agency says that since 2019 there's been a 400% increase in in-flight outbursts, including both unruly behaviour and violent attacks. Since 2021, the department has recorded 13,800 unruly passenger incidents, while one in five attendants have experienced a physical incident.But experts dispute that air travel has declined in quality. Dan Bubb, an aviation historian and professor at University of Nevada Las Vegas, told the BBC that, despite the rise in incivility cases, statistically that number wasn't very significant. There are far more travellers and flights now than there used to be, and Prof Bubb said that makes it difficult to compare today's airline incidents with past decades. Mr Keyes pointed out what he sees as another major issue with Duffy's message: air travel used to bring a host of other issues we no longer face today. \"It's laughable how much worse air travel was back then,\" Mr Keyes said. Flying was far less safe, he said, noting that planes crashed and were hijacked more frequently. Flights were also far more expensive relative to income. Among other drawbacks: the cabins were filled with cigarette smoke, and flight attendants faced rampant sexism and stringent physical requirements. Mr Keyes believes the FAA and DOT could make more of a difference in reducing passenger stress by pushing airlines to minimise the number of delays and cancellations. Prof Bubb said it would also help to \"give passengers a little more physical space in terms of seat size and legroom, include meal service in the price of their tickets, reduce alcohol consumption, make going through security at airports less stressful, make parking at airports easier, expand boarding area space at airport gates\". And, he added, we do still need to encourage passengers to be courteous to flight crews and each other.",

    "body": "2 days agoPaul AdamsDiplomatic correspondentReutersUkrainian soldiers near Kharkiv this week   Are we any closer to peace in Ukraine?After a frantic, often confusing few days of diplomacy, Donald Trump seems to think so.\"We're getting very close to a deal,\" he told reporters on Tuesday.For his part, Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelensky, who had looked and sounded grim over the weekend, said there were now \"many prospects that can make the path to peace real\". \"There are significant results,\" he said, after reviewing the results of Sunday's key discussions in Geneva, \"and there is still much work to be done.\"But from the Russians, apart from some discontented mutterings about European involvement and unauthorised leaks, the response has been somewhat muted.Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said on Wednesday that Moscow viewed some elements of the latest draft positively but \"many require special discussions among experts\".Separately, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said it was \"premature\" to think that a deal was close.Given the gulf that exists between Ukraine and Russia on so many key issues – including territory, Nato membership, who should pay for Ukraine's reconstruction and how will those involved in war crimes be held accountable – it is hard to see all the necessary pieces falling into place anytime soon.Last Wednesday already seems like aeons ago. That is when a leaked draft of a 28-point US plan to end the war first emerged.The plan, whose references to Ukraine giving up territory and limiting the size of its military led some to describe it as a \"Russian wish list\", caused consternation in Kyiv and sent European diplomats scrambling to limit the perceived damage.In some ways, it felt like a re-run of events in August, when anxious European leaders rushed to Washington to bend Trump's ear after the American president rolled out the red carpet to Putin in Alaska.By the weekend, the Europeans had drafted a counter-proposal, also 28 points long, which replaced the blunt territorial concessions of the US plan with \"negotiations on territorial swaps\" and stiffened the language on security guarantees, a key concern of Kyiv.But how much influence the Europeans had over Sunday's talks in Geneva remains unclear.A joint US-Ukrainian statement, issued after the talks wrapped up, spoke of \"highly productive\" discussions, saying any future agreement must deliver a \"sustainable and just peace\". Sir Keir Starmer was one of several European leaders who seized on the words \"sustainable and just\" as indicating that progress had been made.Ukrainian officials sounded relieved too. The First Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergiy Kyslytsya, said the latest version of the plan had been slimmed down to just 19 points, with the most contentious issues – territory and Ukraine's future relations with Nato – put off for Trump and Zelensky to decide.Amid recriminations over how the original 28-point version had been leaked (with fingers pointing in multiple directions), a tight veil of secrecy has been drawn around the latest version.Despite talks in Abu Dhabi involving the US army secretary, Dan Driscoll (a new addition to Trump's Ukraine team), Ukraine's military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, and Russian officials, Ushakov says the plan has still not been discussed in detail.With Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff due in Moscow next week and talk of Zelensky paying another visit to the White House, it seems the pace of diplomacy is not about to let up.EPABut where are we?\"We are now on a fast track to something,\" says Daniel Fried, former US assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs.\"To a failure or a fast track to a success, I can't say, but it's moving fast.\"Ambassador Fried says last week's 28-point US plan was a \"hot mess\" but that the impetus behind it is real.\"To the Trump administration's credit, it's pushing hard for a settlement.\"The sense of dread which settled over Kyiv last week - which caused Zelensky to observe that Ukraine was facing one of the most difficult moments in its history – has lifted.\"In Geneva, Ukraine's delegation was very satisfied,\" says Myroslava Gongadze, a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center, speaking from Kyiv.\"The point of the exercise was not exactly to make an agreement but to throw out that 28-point plan and put some Ukrainian interest in that possible negotiation and show that Ukraine is really willing to discuss and negotiate.\"But if Kyiv feels it has successfully countered some of the worst of what was being demanded – and we still do not know how much – there are plenty of lingering concerns.Chief among them: what sort of security guarantees can it expect to receive if it finally strikes a deal with the country that launched an unprovoked invasion of its territory and still seems to covet more?\"The essential question we must ask here is security guarantees,\" says Gongadze. \"Who will be giving those guarantees, who is being held accountable and which border would not be violated?\"If the answers are weak, then it's setting up Ukraine for another crisis.\"ReutersTrump's special envoy Steve Witkoff is in due in Moscow next week In response to the original US document's rather vague promise to offer \"reliable security guarantees\", European leaders spoke of a US guarantee that \"mirrors Article 5\", a reference to Nato's principle of collective defence.Last week, the Axios news website reported the existence of a separate US paper, presented to Ukraine, which outlines \"security assurance modelled on the principles of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, adapted to the circumstances of this conflict\". This critical aspect of the plan is clearly still a work in progress. Following Tuesday's virtual meeting of the UK-French led Coalition of the Willing, participants agreed with the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, to \"accelerate joint work with the United States to take forward the planning on security guarantees\". Sir Keir Starmer says operational plans for a multinational \"reassurance force\" for Ukraine are fully formed but until the Trump administration indicates what, if any, backup it is willing to provide, those plans remain largely theoretical.\"Security guarantees are going to have to be fleshed out,\" says Ambassador Fried.\"The Coalition of the Willing is a great idea, but it hasn't landed on any result to date, partly because they are waiting to see whether the Americans will back them and partly because they're waiting to see what they're going into.\"Where we are on territory is another big unknown.Last week's 28-point plan stated, bluntly, that Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk would be \"recognised as de facto Russian\", and that Ukrainian forces would withdraw from the heavily contested parts of the Donetsk region still under Kyiv's control.All this language vanished in the European counter-proposal. Ukraine, it said, would commit \"not to recover its occupied sovereign territory through military means\". All territorial negotiations, it said, would \"start from the Line of Contact\" – the current front lines.It is not known the extent to which Europe's approach informed the document that emerged after the talks in Geneva.The joint US-Ukrainian communique offered only an oblique insight, saying the two sides \"reaffirmed that any future agreement must fully uphold Ukraine's sovereignty\".The word \"fully\" appeared to be carrying a lot of weight.Given Trump's mercurial approach to the war in Ukraine, Putin's lingering ambitions and Zelensky's domestic difficulties - the current round of diplomacy takes place in the midst of a corruption scandal that is undermining his domestic standing - it is extremely difficult to know where this process goes next.But it might be overly optimistic to think we are near the end.\"We're still in the middle of this process,\" says Leslie Shedd, another of the Atlantic Council's non-resident fellows.\"There's certainly a long way to go still.\"But for all the apparent chaos surrounding the Trump administration's efforts, including a constantly shifting – and possibly competing – cast of characters, Shedd believes the administration is serious.\"It appears that the president… [is] truly prioritising finding a peace in Ukraine. And I think that is actually really important.\"",

    "body": "1 day agoKennedy GondweLusakaAFP via Getty ImagesHakainde Hichilema says that his government's investments will take time to bear fruitZambia's President Hakainde Hichilema has come out fighting after a bruising month that saw him come under attack by stone throwers as he was trying to make a speech.Video clips of him crouching and then being whisked away from a rally in the Copperbelt province shocked Zambians and many people, irrespective of their political affiliation, condemned what happened.But with nine months to go until elections and a run for a second term, the president is under pressure.On Tuesday, in his first press conference for 18 months, Hichilema set out to defend his record and laid out his achievements on the key issues of the economy and power generation.\"This level of hatred is shocking, you can see and even touch the venom,\" he said, while appealing for Zambians to love each other.But the message may not hit home with those who are continuing to struggle day to day.The president has lost touch with \"the real pulse of the people\", according to an opposition candidate to be mayor of the capital, Lusaka, Simon Mwila, who was trying to explain why people were throwing stones \"rather than flowers\".Sishuwa Sishuwa, a Zambian historian and senior lecturer at South Africa's Stellenbosch University, argues that the president has turned his back on what he once stood for.\"In power and over the last four years, Hichilema has turned out to be nearly everything he detested about his predecessor, Edgar Lungu, and, in some cases, much worse,\" the academic told the BBC.This is a charge rejected by the president, who pointed out his record on solving the debt crisis that he inherited and stabilising government finances.On 8 November, Hichilema may have hoped for a friendlier reception in Chingola town, particularly as he had arrived with $450,000 (£340,000) to go towards rebuilding a local market that had been destroyed in a fire.Instead, an angry crowd forced him to abandon his address.Police blamed the trouble on \"unruly members of the public\" who were allegedly looting local shops. At least 27 people have been arrested for violence and arson.At his press conference this week, Hichilema accused illegal artisanal miners of being behind the violence as his government was trying to crack down on this unregistered work.\"We will not allow any thuggery to return ever again,\" he said.XA grainy video captured the moment that President Hakainde Hichilema (crouching behind the microphone) came under attackIn the 2021 elections, Hichilema, who had already made five unsuccessful runs for the presidency, surfed a wave of popularity that swept him into power in a landslide victory over Lungu.By polling day, the country had defaulted on its debts, annual price inflation was touching 25% and there were frequent power blackouts.Under the slogan \"Bally will fix it\" (\"bally\" is Zambian slang for father), he positioned himself as the solution to virtually all the problems the country faced.Debt repayments have since been renegotiated and inflation has come down.This week, Hichilema said that whereas four years ago there was a \"huge debt mountain\" and \"we were living beyond our means\", now Zambia's credit rating had improved and it was attracting investment from all over the world.He also argued that the country's vital mining sector was rebounding.But with the August 2026 election approaching, Hichilema is finding out that he is not necessarily thanked for what he has achieved but rather criticised for what has not changed.Economist Trevor Hambayi has described the progress with the nation's finances as an \"overriding success story\".Better budgetary controls have helped boost investment in infrastructure, education, social programmes, health and the recruitment of essential government workers.Annual inflation has come down to just below 12%, and the currency, the kwacha, has recently strengthened following a precipitous decline in the early years of the Hichilema presidency.But Mr Hambayi told the BBC that the failure to resolve the power crisis had had a big impact on people, along with the \"high cost of living and the lack of employment opportunities\".\"These are the metrics that speak to the ordinary Zambian.\"In its October report, the Lusaka-based Jesuit Centre for Theological Reflection, which monitors the cost of living, said people were being squeezed by high prices for essential food and non-food items that \"continue to absorb a growing share of household income\".It added that although inflation had eased, \"many families still cannot meet basic needs without reducing food quality or skipping meals\".The president did acknowledge the energy problem in September, saying that the government feels \"the pain and frustration of power outages faced by our citizens\".Getty ImagesPower shortages are making the lives of ordinary people very hardAnd this week he said Zambia's generation capacity had been \"decapitated\" by a recent drought owing to its reliance on hydroelectricity.\"This challenge was a wake-up call. Now we have woken up,\" he added, promising more solar and thermal energy projects.Throughout his 15 years in opposition, Hichilema portrayed himself as an upholder of democratic values.But once in state house, he has been accused of passing oppressive measures which he had previously opposed, such as the Cybersecurity Law.This legislation, while seen as necessary for dealing with things like online fraud and child pornography, has been criticised for allowing the surveillance of anyone the state sees as undesirable.Academic Dr Sishuwa also accused Hichilema of using the law against his opponents - exactly what he had criticised under the previous administration.\"After he commendably abolished the law on defamation of the president, he quickly turned to other repressive statutes to arrest critics and political opponents on a variety of charges such as sedition, criminal libel, hate speech, espionage and unlawful assembly,\" he said.The president insists that his government respects the rule of law and has not targeted anyone for political reasons.Hichilema has also backed a controversial constitutional review process, including a plan to increase the number of constituencies so there would be more MPs in parliament.While in opposition, he successfully campaigned against a review that incorporated a similar idea, saying this would enable then-President Lungu to stay in power and that it was too close to elections to embark on such a huge change.He now argues that, according to the constitution, Zambia needs to create new constituencies every 10 years.The president says that the delimitation exercise, or the increase in the number of constituencies, is important to ensure that resources are distributed equally.And he has hit out at critics who are planning to hold national prayers to protest against the process on Friday, saying there is already a consultation process and discussions at state house, as well as legal avenues to object.With the clock ticking down towards next year's election, the president appears concerned about the way that people are responding to him.While calling for tempers to cool, Hichilema has urged patience, saying it takes time for long-term development and investment programmes to have an impact.But as the volley of stones thrown his way attests, patience may be wearing thin for some.More about Zambia from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "They can't crush our protests, vow Georgians after year of resistance1 day agoRayhan DemytrieCaucasus correspondentNurPhoto via Getty ImagesHundreds of protesters turn out every night, a year after pro-European demonstrations began\"I'm standing for the future of this country,\" says Giorgi Arabuli, who has taken part in protests on the streets of Georgia's capital Tbilisi almost every night since they began a year ago.Mass demonstrations were met with violent police crackdowns as tens of thousands of Georgians turned out, angered by Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze's decision on 28 November 2024 to call a four-year halt on moves towards joining the EU.\"I'm from the generation of the 1990s. I've seen those dark times after the civil war,\" said Giorgi. \"Most of it was caused by Russian influence in a post-Soviet country. We don't want to go back there.\"Since then Georgians have seen a \"dismantling of democracy\", in the words of governments across Europe, and it has prompted accusations of Russian-style rule.On the streets, the protests have evolved into a grinding war of attrition.For months, Tbilisi's main Rustaveli Avenue was blocked for a few hours every evening. New laws and a heavy police presence forced the protesters to adapt, marching through adjacent streets and facing nightly arrests.NurPhoto via Getty ImagesProtesters still try to gather on Rustaveli Avenue but police quickly clear the roadThe Georgian Dream government has imposed massive fines for blocking roads, slapped criminal charges on young protesters and most recently pushed through a law allowing up to 14 days' imprisonment for a first offence of blocking traffic, with repeat offenders facing up to a year in jail.\"Freedom for regime prisoners,\" reads a large banner carried towards the nearby Supreme Court.\"They've used every method to crush the protests... but the fact is they haven't been able to,\" says Nata Koridze. Her husband, Zura Japaridze, is one of six key opposition figures jailed after refusing to testify before a parliamentary commission into alleged crimes by the previous government.The six were jailed for up to eight months and banned from holding public office for two years.Prosecutors have since announced new charges against eight opposition leaders, including Japaridze. They now face up to 15 years for alleged sabotage and aiding foreign powers.Nata Koridze's husband is due to be released on 22 December but she says he is due to appear in court again three days later.They are accused of communicating with Western partners about government abuses - standard democratic practice - as evidence of betraying state interests.Japaridze, like all the jailed politicians, is held in solitary confinement.\"Zura has not seen anybody except for a doctor and the guard,\" she says.Georgia's path to EU membership, once the cornerstone of its post-Soviet identity, is now farther away than ever.Earlier this month, the EU's annual enlargement report delivered what its ambassador to Georgia called \"devastating\" findings, concluding it was now considered an EU candidate \"in name only\".\"Georgia is not on the trajectory to become an EU member state, neither in 2030 nor later,\" said Pawel Herczynski, rejecting the government's pledge to ensure membership by 2030.The BBC approached the head of the parliamentary committee on European integration and other Georgian Dream MPs for comment, but no-one was available.The government's public response has been increasingly hostile towards its foreign critics.Parliamentary speaker Shalva Papuashvili has accused the EU of \"ideological and political dictates\", telling pro-government TV this month that \"today's Brussels does not want a Georgia that is like us\".\"They want a country standing on one foot,\" he complained. \"The policies and approaches in Brussels must be changed. For them, the Georgian people and their choice mean nothing, zero.\"Georgian Dream, in power since 2012, won 54% of the vote in last year's disputed parliamentary elections, which monitors from Europe's OSCE security mission said were marked by several shortcomings, including intimidation, coercion and pressure on voters, especially public sector employees.All opposition parties have since boycotted parliament leaving it entirely in government hands. That means increasingly repressive legislation has been passed unopposed.As well as steep fines for protesters blocking the road, there have been a restrictive broadcasting law and a law on foreign grants requiring all foreign funding for civil society and media to be approved by a government commission.Hundreds of protesters have been fined and dozens jailed, among them well-known actor Andro Chichinadze, given two years for allegedly organising protests.His theatre - once the best attended in Tbilisi - has closed in solidarity.Andro Chichinadze's theatre used to sell out regularly - it has now shut down The belief that Georgia's government is acting in Russia's interest is widespread among pro-Europeans here.They point to the ruling party's billionaire founder, Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s; legislation mirroring Russian laws targeting civil society; the government's refusal to impose sanctions on Moscow over Ukraine and increasingly hostile anti-Western rhetoric.Georgia's leaders reject that portrayal, describing their approach towards Russia as \"pragmatic\" and their primary duty to maintain peace with their northern neighbour.\"Where are the facts?\" said Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, denying pro-Russian bias during a recent TV interview. The government, he said, was being \"responsible to Georgian society which wants to keep peace in the country\".BatumelebiAcclaimed journalist Mzia Amaglobeli was arrested in January and remains in jailThat is not the view of one of Georgia's most respected journalists, Mzia Amaglobeli, imprisoned for two years for slapping a police officer.\"Russia is conquering us without war. An oligarch is ruling our country, depriving us of a European future and legitimising autocratic, dictatorial rule. We need the support of the democratic world,\" she told the BBC in a handwritten letter from prison.Amaglobeli, who will be awarded the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought next month, says she has lost the sight of one eye and her remaining vision is worsening in solitary confinement: \"I have difficulty reading for even 10-15 minutes at a time.\"Georgia's democratic decline intensified even before last year's elections, with a June 2024 Russian-style law on foreign influence that targeted civil society and independent media.Students played a big part in protests at the time and the government has responded with sweeping education reforms planned next February. Georgia's 19 state universities will be required to concentrate on a single academic discipline under the slogan \"one city, one faculty\".The reforms will tackle perceived problems including excessive concentration of universities in Tbilisi, duplication of programmes and inadequate state funding.The prime minister argues that funding should be \"focused on fulfilling state tasks\". Leading figures at Georgia's pre-eminent research institution, Ilia State University, say the reform is more about imposing political control and eradicating free space.\"After political parties, media and NGOs, universities must be put under pressure,\" says Nina Doborjginidze, rector of Ilia State University. \"If students are removed from the capital, they're removed from the political scene.\"\"This is not about education quality, it's a political project,\" adds vice-rector Georgi Gvalia. \"This is an abrupt change in Georgia's foreign policy from being one of the most pro-European countries in the region to the most difficult partners of the West, and change towards more autocratic great powers, like Russia and especially China.\"Georgia and China now have a strategic partnership and Beijing has invested heavily in Georgian infrastructure.Back on Rustaveli Avenue, teacher Rusudan Lomidze, who has attended the protests every day, says Georgia's fate is inextricably linked to Ukraine's.\"If Ukraine is forced to sign a capitulation agreement, it will be an absolute disaster for us. Our boys are fighting in Ukraine, and they are fighting for both Ukraine and Georgia.\"More than 110 Georgian volunteers have been killed fighting for Ukraine, both Georgian citizens and ethnic Georgians, and the Georgian Legion is the biggest contingent of foreign fighters there.Controversial law highlights struggle for futureThe crowds in Tbilisi are smaller than they were a year ago, but several hundred protesters still gather every night despite the risks. Reflecting on her years as a diplomat working towards EU and Nato integration, Nata Koridze now believes \"all of that has crumbled\". \"But the protest embodies an idea. And ideas live through decades, through centuries.\"",

    "body": "22 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent  , Southern LebanonNeha Sharma/BBCLast Friday, at around 19:00, an Israeli air strike hit a car in a village in southern Lebanon called Froun. This part of the country is the heartland of the Shia Muslim community, and for decades has been under the sway of Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia militia and political party. On streets, banners with the faces of fighters killed in battle hang from lamp-posts, celebrating them as \"martyrs of the resistance\".I arrived in Froun an hour after the strike. Rescue workers had already removed the body parts of the only casualty - a man who was later described as a \"Hezbollah terrorist\" by the Israeli military. Despite a ceasefire deal that came into force last November, ending the latest war with Hezbollah, Israel has continued with its bombing, almost every day.\"Who is going to help us?\" one resident, Mohamad Mokdad, asked me. The car had been hit as it passed in front of his house, and he was still cleaning up the veranda. \"There were body parts here and in the trees.\" He sounded despondent. \"We're against all this... I just want to live in peace. I don't want parties,\" he said. He did not mention Hezbollah - which means \"Party of God\" - by name, but that is probably what he meant. \"I don't want anyone.\"Israel says it is targeting Hezbollah and the group's efforts to recover after being severely weakened in the war. I travelled to southern Lebanon to see the impact of the Israeli campaign, and saw that the attacks had shattered people's sense of security and even some long-held views in areas where Hezbollah has traditionally enjoyed widespread support.Neha Sharma/BBCThe Israeli attack in Froun happened outside Mohamad Mokdad's houseThe ceasefire in Lebanon ended 13 months of war that killed 4,000 Lebanese and 120 Israelis. Israel and Hezbollah have been fighting for decades, and this conflict started when Hezbollah began firing rockets and missiles at Israeli positions a day after Israel launched its massive military response to the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023.The truce, brokered by the US and France, required Hezbollah to remove its fighters and weapons from the south of the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) from the border with Israel, and Israeli troops to withdraw from areas of southern Lebanon that they invaded during the war. Thousands of Lebanese soldiers would then be sent to areas that had been effectively under Hezbollah control.A year later, the Israeli military continues to occupy at least five hilltops in southern Lebanon and has carried out air and drone attacks across the country on targets it claims are linked to Hezbollah. Last Sunday, it killed the group's chief of staff and four others in a strike on a building in the Dahieh district, outside Beirut.Unifil, the United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon that operates south of the Litani, says Israel has committed more than 10,000 air and ground violations during the ceasefire. According to the Lebanese health ministry, more than 330 people have been killed in Israeli attacks, including civilians.Israeli officials say Hezbollah has been working to rebuild its military capabilities south of the Litani, which would be a violation of the ceasefire, and also tried to smuggle weapons into Lebanon while ramping up the production of explosive drones as an alternative to rockets and missiles. So far, Israel has not made the evidence it says it has public. But, for weeks, Israeli journalists have been briefed on plans for a possible escalation against the group. \"Hezbollah is playing with fire, and the president of Lebanon is dragging his feet,\" Israel Katz, the Israeli defence minister, said recently.Neha Sharma/BBCLebanese communities along the border with Israel are still in ruins, and thousands of residents remain displacedJoseph Aoun, the Lebanese president, came to power in January promising a \"state monopoly on arms\" - in other words, to disarm Hezbollah. The group is considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US. But in Lebanon, Hezbollah is more than a militia. Despite the recent blows, it remains a powerful political party with representation in the government and parliament, and a significant social movement, providing services in areas where the state is absent.A Unifil spokesperson told me they had not observed any military activity by Hezbollah or attempts to rebuild infrastructure. Hezbollah, too, rejects the Israeli allegations and says the terms of the ceasefire deal only apply to south of the Litani. There, it has not opposed the Lebanese army's operations against its arsenal. The group has not fired on Israel since the truce came into force, although it did launch several mortars that hit an Israeli army base in the disputed Mount Dov/Shebaa Farms area in the occupied Golan Heights in December, in response to what it said were repeated Israeli violations.Neha Sharma/BBCThe map, issued by a spokesperson for the Israeli military, showing locations that were allegedly being used by Hezbollah in the village of Beit LifLast week, Lt Col Avichay Adraee, the Arabic spokesman for the Israeli army, published on social media a warning for the Lebanese village of Beit Lif: Israel had detected \"dozens of terrorist infrastructures\" belonging to Hezbollah, and would act to remove any threat. Worried that an attack could be imminent, residents made a public appeal, late at night, for Lebanese soldiers to be deployed.I visited Beit Lif the following morning. (To travel to southern Lebanon, we had to inform Hezbollah's media office in Beirut; the group did not interfere in our reporting.) The village had a pre-war population of around 8,000; now, less than a third remains. The local imam, a 63-year-old man who did not want to have his name published, told me the Lebanese soldiers had arrived with Unifil troops, patrolled the streets and left after about five hours, before dawn. The Lebanese military has refused to inspect private properties, possibly in order not to be seen to be collaborating with Israel; in Beit Lif too, the imam said, they did not enter any houses.As we spoke, half a dozen men gathered around us on the grounds of a mosque that had been destroyed in an Israeli air strike during the war. Quietly, one of them told me: \"Hezbollah needs to decide: it either responds to Israel or accepts defeat, disarms and let us move on with our lives. This can't continue.\"Public criticism of Hezbollah is still rare but, exhausted, some appear to be questioning the old consensus. We then heard a distant sound – from Israeli fighter jets in the sky.One of the locations that appeared to have been highlighted in Col Adraee's  message was a house in front of the municipality building. Israel has frequently accused Hezbollah of embedding its arsenal in civilian areas, an allegation I had also heard from some residents during the war. Ezzat Hammoud, the Beit Lif mayor, told me: \"No, no, no. There are no militants or weapons here. I can be held responsible for what I'm saying.\" So why, if that was the case, had his village attracted the attention of the Israeli military? \"Either to terrify the residents and force them to move,\" he said, \"or to put pressure on the Lebanese army to confront people.\"Neha Sharma/BBCHaider said his house had been marked by the Israeli military as a building being used by Hezbollah, which he deniedA man called Haider, whose family owned the house, insisted on taking me to visit it. Outside, a poster remembered his brother, a Hezbollah fighter, who had been killed in the war. Haider said he wanted to prove there was nothing wrong there, appearing to believe that by being in the media he would, somehow, be protected. \"You can enter room by room and check with your own eyes,\" he said. It is difficult for us to confirm what could be happening here. He later said: \"We want stability, we don't want war, or anything related to it.\" Just months ago, it would have been almost impossible to have a conversation like this or even talk to people without being approached by Hezbollah members. Haider complained about how unsafe he felt, and I asked him what Hezbollah should do. He did not give me a straight answer but said: \"We're done. We're worn out.\"Despite the warning, Israel has not attacked the village.Neha Sharma/BBCIn Yaroun's main square, a banner remembered the late Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, killed in an Israeli air strike last yearIn a televised speech earlier this month, Naim Qassem, Hezbollah's secretary general, addressed the issue of Israel's continued attacks, warning that \"everything has a limit\". He said the group would \"never\" surrender its weapons, which he called the \"source of its strength\". \"The enemy,\" Qassem said, referring to Israel and the United States, \"wants to erase our life and our existence, but we'll remain steadfast. We'll either live with dignity or die with dignity.\"Hezbollah's arsenal, more powerful than that of the country's own army, has long divided the Lebanese. Opponents accuse Hezbollah of dragging Lebanon into wars and of defending the interests of the group's main backer, Iran. They see this as a unique opportunity to disarm it. But President Aoun, who is a former army chief, has refused to use force against Hezbollah, saying this could exacerbate sectarian divisions and lead to a civil war. If the authorities were not careful, Aoun said in April, \"we'll lead Lebanon to ruin\".A Western diplomat familiar with the discussions told me the Lebanese authorities were under increasing pressure from the Trump administration, which was frustrated with the pace of the efforts and supported Israel's actions in Lebanon. \"Some are seeing this as the 'Lebanese way' of doing things,\" the diplomat said about the disarmament plans, and \"aren't convinced\" it can work.The army is expected to announce it has completed the disarmament of the group in the areas south of the Litani next month. The army, an intelligence officer told me, would then turn its attention to other parts of the country - Hezbollah's presence is also significant in the Dahieh and the eastern Bekaa Valley. This will be a more challenging, and risky, mission without the group's consent, and there is no timeline for that.Neha Sharma/BBCNayef al-Rida is one of the few remaining residents in the border village of Yaroun, which was devastated during the warI drove on to the border village of Yaroun. From there, I could see a concrete wall that Israeli soldiers had recently built inside Lebanon. The authorities say this is another Israeli violation of the ceasefire agreement, and a breach of the country's sovereignty. Lebanese communities along the frontier are still in ruins - Lebanon's international partners have so far refused to fund reconstruction, in part because of the impasse over Hezbollah's disarmament - with the Israeli military enforcing a de facto buffer zone. Tens of thousands of Lebanese remain displaced, without knowing when - or if - they will be able to return.In Yaroun's square, a billboard with a picture of the late Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, killed in an Israeli air strike in the Dahieh when the conflict escalated last year, remained largely intact. A few metres away, I saw a man outside one of the few standing houses. Nayef al-Rida had moved there with his wife and an elderly relative. We could hear the constant sound of an Israeli drone, circling overhead. \"This happens 24/7,\" he said. I wondered how he felt living there. \"We've got every reason to be afraid,\" Mr Rida said. \"There's no-one here. You'll leave in a bit, and we'll be left alone.\"A worn-out Hezbollah flag was hanging from a tree near his house. He said he was not confident that the group would give up its weapons. I asked him what he thought would happen. \"We wait for God's mercy,\" he said. \"This is no life.\"Additional reporting by Gaith Solh and Neha Sharma",

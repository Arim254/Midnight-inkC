    "body": "9 hours agoKelly NgGetty ImagesAndre McKechnie argues the Vegemite ban in Victoria's jails denies him the right to \"enjoy his culture\"A convicted murderer serving a life sentence in Australia is challenging a ban on prisoners consuming Vegemite - the polarising, salty spread that has become a national symbol.State authorities say inmates may use the strong-smelling condiment to disguise contraband substances or brew alcohol behind bars.But Andre McKechnie argues that the ban, in place in the state of Victoria since 2006, denies him the right to \"enjoy his culture as an Australian\", according to court documents seen by AFP and AP.McKechnie was handed a life sentence for stabbing a property developer to death in Queensland in the 1990s. He served part of his sentence in Queensland before being transferred to Victoria.In his lawsuit against Victoria's Department of Justice and Corrections, the agency managing the state's prisons, the 54-year-old said he wanted the Vegemite ban overturned.He also wants prison authorities to declare that they \"failed to provide food adequate to maintain [his] wellbeing\".The case is scheduled for trial next year, AP reported.A much-loved breakfast spread for some, Vegemite has acquired controversial accolades since it first hit shop shelves in Australia in 1923.The thick, brown condiment - made primarily from yeast extract - was invented in the Victorian capital of Melbourne more than a century ago as an alternative to the British spread Marmite. In 2022, Melbourne declared the smell of Vegemite wafting from a factory in the city a \"significant\" aspect of the city's cultural heritage. However, the condiment's polarising taste has landed it in the Disgusting Food Museum in Sweden - alongside natto, stinky tofu and monkey brains.Vegemite sparked an international dispute in April this year when an Australian cafe owner in Canada was told to remove jars of the condiment from his shelves as it did not comply with local health regulations.Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese intervened in the row, saying it was \"rather odd\" that Canada allowed the sale of Vegemite's \"rubbish\" rival product Marmite. The Canadian agency soon changed course and allowed the cafe owner to continue selling the spread.",

    "body": "22 hours agoHugh Schofield,Paris and Rachel HaganGetty ImagesSecond-hand clothing platform Vinted is under investigation in France after some user accounts were found to be directing visitors to pornographic content.France's Children's Rights Commissioner Sarah El-Haïry said she had asked watchdog Arcom to examine the allegations first reported in French media.Vinted, which has 23 million users in France, has no age-verification procedure - meaning children and teenagers could have been exposed to pornographic material without having to show proof they were over 18.In a statement, the Lithuania-based company said it had a \"zero-tolerance policy regarding unsolicited communications of a sexual nature or the promotion of sexual services\".\"All inappropriate and illegal content is removed, and where necessary we take measures against users, including blocking them definitively from our site,\" it was cited as saying by the AFP news agency.Vinted is taking the situation \"very seriously\", it added. Reports first surfaced after some sellers showing photographs of swimwear or lingerie were found to be luring viewers to their personal pages on adult platforms such as OnlyFans. \"Predators have been using the sale of ordinary items of clothing to direct people to porn sites,\" El-Haïry said.France has recently issued warnings to other global e-commerce platforms, including Shein - headquartered in Singapore - after products including childlike sex dolls appeared in their marketing listings. French officials say the case against Shein forms part of a wider investigation into other major e-commerce platforms accused of allowing illicit products to be sold online.Paris prosecutors are examining whether Shein, AliExpress, Temu and Wish breached laws relating to violent, pornographic or \"undignified\" content accessible to minors.Shein and AliExpress are also being investigated specifically over the alleged dissemination of child-related pornographic material. The cases have been referred to the Paris Office des Mineurs, which handles offences involving the protection of children.Shein has already banned the sale of all sex dolls on its platform worldwide and says it is permanently blocking seller accounts linked to the items. The French consumer watchdog, the Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control, said descriptions of the dolls left \"little doubt as to their child-pornography nature\".",

    "body": "12 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterThe releases of at least two popular Japanese films have been postponed in China amid a dispute over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's remarks concerning Taiwan.The delayed releases include Cells at Work! and Crayon Shin-chan the Movie: Super Hot! The Spicy Kasukabe Dancers, according to Chinese state media CCTV.Cinema tickets are still available for the hit Japanese animation Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle, the BBC has confirmed, but CCTV said sales in China had fallen recently as the row deepened.Takaichi, who has been a vocal critic of China and its activities in the region, suggested earlier this month that Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan.Beijing views Taiwan - to which the government overthrown by China's communist revolution fled - as a breakaway province that must be reunited with the mainland.Film distributors and importers have decided to postpone the releases after reassessing the overall outlook of Japanese films in China and the sentiment among Chinese audiences, CCTV reported on Monday.Crayon Shin-chan the Movie: Super Hot! The Spicy Kasukabe Dancers, which is an animated comedy about the adventures of a young boy and his friends, was due to be released in the coming weeks.Cells at Work! - which has also seen its release postponed - is a live action movie based on a manga about human blood cells fighting off viruses.CCTV did not say how long the films' releases will be delayed for.The state-controlled media outlet said Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle had faced \"strong dissatisfaction among Chinese audiences\" following Takaichi's remarks.The BBC has contacted the films' distributors, including Japanese media giant Toho.Takaichi told the Japanese parliament on 7 November: \"If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation.\"Beijing has since urged its citizens to avoid travel to Japan and told students to reconsider studying there, citing safety risks.Japanese tourism, airline and retail stocks fell sharply as investors weighed the impact of the China's response.China is a key source of tourism to Japan, with almost 7.5m visitors in the first nine months of this year.Beijing believes that, in time, Taiwan will be returned to Chinese control. It has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this goal.But many Taiwanese consider themselves to be part of a separate nation - although most are in support of keeping the status quo in which Taiwan neither declares independence from China nor unites with it.",

    "body": "26 minutes agoAdam Easton,Warsaw correspondent and Jaroslav LukivTwo Ukrainian citizens who long worked for Russian intelligence have been identified as the suspects behind two acts of sabotage on Poland's rail network, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said.One suspect had already been convicted in absentia of acts of sabotage in Ukraine, Tusk told parliament.On Monday, he visited the scene of an explosion near Mika, south-east of Warsaw, which damaged the railway line leading to the Ukrainian border at the weekend, and called it an \"unprecedented act of sabotage\".Another incident down the line near Pulawy on Monday forced a packed train to stop suddenly and damage was found to overhead cables.The Kremlin brushed off suggestions of Russian involvement.Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said: \"It would have been really strange, if Russia hadn't been blamed first.\"\"Russia is accused of all acts of hybrid and direct war... in Poland,\" he told Russia's state-run media, adding: \"Russophobia is certainly rampant there.\"Polish authorities had initially said there was a very high chance that the two acts of sabotage on the Warsaw-Lublin railway line had been ordered by a \"foreign service\". Then a spokesman for Poland's special services minister said on Tuesday that \"everything points to them being Russian special services\".\"The goal was to cause a rail catastrophe,\" Tusk told MPs.The Polish prime minister said he would not disclose the names of the two suspects as this could complicate the operation, though he told parliament that one was living in Belarus and the other was a resident of eastern Ukraine.Both suspects had crossed into Poland from Belarus during the autumn and had now returned there via the border crossing at Terespol in the far south-west of Belarus, close to the Ukrainian border, he added.Tusk said that a military-grade C4 explosive device had been detonated on 15 November at about 21:00 (20:00 GMT) near the village of Mika.The explosion, which happened as a freight train was passing, caused minor damage to a wagon floor. It was captured on CCTV.Tusk said the train driver had not even noticed the incident.A previous attempt to derail a train by placing a steel clamp on the rail had failed, he added.The second act of sabotage, on 17 November, involved a train carrying 475 passengers having to suddenly brake because of damaged railway infrastructure, said Tusk.The prime minister also said he would issue an order later on Tuesday to raise the alert level on certain railway lines.He said since the start of last year 55 people had been detained on suspicion of assisting, preparing, or committing acts of sabotage and that 23 of them had been remanded in custody.Russia's motivation, Tusk went on, was to sow panic and stir up anti-Ukrainian sentiment in Polish society, which is home to more than one million Ukrainian war refugees.\"I want to emphasise that what the Russian authorities care about is not only the direct effect of this type of action, but also the social and political consequences of the fact that this action is taking place,\" he said.\"This of course means disorganisation, chaos, panic, speculation and uncertainty.\"Poland is both a Nato and EU member state, and its railway network has become vital for moving supplies of aid into Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.In September, Tusk said three Russian drones had been shot down by Polish and other Nato aircraft in Poland's airspace during overnight attacks on Ukraine.He said at the time that authorities had recorded 19 drone incursions, with some flying deep enough to temporarily close four airports, including Warsaw's main hub Chopin.Russia's defence ministry responded by saying there had been \"no plans\" to target facilities on Polish soil.",

    "body": "A US federal judge says \"investigative missteps\" and \"government misconduct\" may have tainted the Trump administration's criminal case against former FBI director James Comey.Judge William Fitzpatrick ordered justice department lawyers to release grand jury materials, including transcripts and evidence, to Mr Comey's defence team. The justice department has appealed against the order.Mr Comey was charged with making false statements and obstruction of justice in September, after Donald Trump called for his prosecution and appointed a new federal prosecutor to pursue the case. The former FBI chief, who has long drawn the US president's ire, has pleaded not guilty to the charges.Mr Comey was fired by Trump during his first term, after leading an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. Since then, he has been a frequent target of the two-term US president.Mr Comey is accused of lying to lawmakers about his Russian election interference investigation during a congressional hearing in 2020.After other federal prosecutors had reportedly declined to pursue the case against him, citing a lack of evidence, Trump made Lindsey Halligan the lead prosecutor in the case. She secured an indictment three days later.An indictment in the US justice system is a formal accusation issued by a grand jury - a group of citizens who examine the merits of evidence - to determine if a case should proceed.Mr Comey was formally charged in October in a federal court in Virginia, where he  pleaded not guilty. His defence team has not only taken issue with the legality of Ms Halligan's quick appointment to the role of interim US attorney, a process through which she circumvented congressional approval, but also filed motions over how she brought the indictment. On Monday, Judge Fitzpatrick wrote in a 24-page opinion that he had identified at least two statements Ms Halligan made to grand jurors that could be seen as \"fundamental misstatements of the law that could compromise the integrity of the grand jury process\". One statement Halligan made, the judge noted, \"suggests\" that the grand jury \"did not have to rely on only the record before them\", and that there was \"more evidence - perhaps better evidence\" that the government had that would be used at trial.In granting Mr Comey's defence team access to all grand jury materials, Judge Fitzpatrick also ordered the justice department to hand over complete audio recordings of the proceedings.\"The court recognises this is an extraordinary remedy,\" Judge Fitzpatrick said. \"Under these unique circumstances [it] is necessary to fully protect the rights of the accused.\" ",

    "body": "The US will sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, President Donald Trump told reporters ahead of a White House meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\"We will be doing that. We will be selling F-35 jets,\" Trump said. \"They've been a great ally.\"The leaders are expected to discuss deals on defence and civilian nuclear power during Tuesday's White House visit, the first by the de facto Saudi leader since journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed and dismembered at the hands of Saudi agents seven years ago.A US intelligence assessment said Prince Mohammed approved the operation that led to the killing. The crown prince denied any role in the murder.Prince Mohammed's last visit was during Trump's first term in 2018, the same year as Khashoggi's murder in Istanbul.While former President Joe Biden did not host the crown prince and promised to make the country a \"pariah\" over its human rights record, Biden did visit Saudi Arabia in 2022 to reach agreements on other issues. Biden said he raised Khashoggi's murder in that meeting.Trump and the crown prince already met in Riyadh in May. There, the US agreed to sell nearly $142bn (£107bn) worth of arms to Saudi Arabia  in what the White House described as the \"largest defence sales agreement in history\", as part of a $600bn investment deal. Saudia Arabia is the largest buyer of US arms.Some American defence officials have raised concerns about a potential sale of F-35s, considered the most advanced fighter jet in the world, to Saudi Arabia. They told US media that they feared it would give Saudi Arabia access to sensitive stealth technology, which the country could then share with China under a security partnership between the two powers.Officials in Israel are also worried, telling US and local media that a deal has the potential to hurt the country's military standing. Israel is the closest US ally in the Middle East and the only country in the region with F-35s.One F-35A jet costs on average $82.5m, according to lead manufacturer Lockheed Martin.During Tuesday's meeting, Trump is also expected to push for Saudi Arabia to sign the Abraham Accords he created and normalise relations with Israel. The Saudis have said that is conditional on a path to a Palestinian state - which the current Israeli government rejects.",

    "body": "15 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporterReutersCanada's parliament has narrowly approved Prime Minister Mark Carney's first federal budget, allowing his minority Liberal government to avert an early election. The fiscal plan, which raises Canada's deficit to a projected C$78bn ($55.3bn; £42.47bn), was passed thanks to crucial support from opposition MPs, including Green Party leader Elizabeth May. Many opposition lawmakers have sharply criticised the fiscal plan - the second largest in history. The plan passed with 170 votes in favour and 168 against. Carney, who served as the former central banker for both Canada and the UK, has defended the budget as a \"generational investment\" to help Canada strengthen its economy.The vote was crucial for Carney's Liberal government, which currently sits two seats short of a majority.It meant that if all 169 Liberal MPs voted in support, the budget would need the backing from either two opposition MPs, or have four opposition MPs abstain.Two NDP MPs abstained along with House Speaker Francis Scarpaleggia, who casts a vote in the event of a tie. Conservative MPs Shannon Stubbs and Matt Jeneroux  - who announced earlier this month that he was resigning - also abstained.Green Party leader Elizabeth May's support also proved crucial. May told reporters she voted in favour of the plan based on commitments made by Carney that he would support Canada's climate targets.\"Without what I heard from the prime minister today, I would have voted no,\" she said.Six takeaways from Canada's federal budgetThe Conservative Party, led by Pierre Poilievre, and the Quebec nationalist bloc Québécois both voted against the budget, accusing Carney's government of failing to address affordability concerns. Poilievre labelled the budget a \"credit card budget\", arguing it did little to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.\"The prime minister's costly deficit gambles our future on the national credit card,\" Poilievre said in the House of Commons on Monday ahead of the vote.Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, who supported the budget, raised concerns of his own, suggesting that while the plan offered much-needed investment, it fell short in addressing Canada's housing crisis and stalled progress on climate action.Getty ImagesGreen Party leader Elizabeth May told reporters she would support the budget after getting assurances from him on Canada's climate targetsThe budget proposes C$140bn of new spending over the next five years \"to strengthen Canada's productivity, competitiveness, and resilience\".It includes money to update ports and other trade infrastructure with the goal of doubling Canadian exports to non-US markets over the next decade.Additionally, the plan allocates direct support for businesses hurt by US tariffs on Canadian goods, with Carney's government projecting the initiatives will attract C$1tn in private sector investment over the next five years.To balance the fiscal plan, Carney has proposed cutting the federal workforce by 10% over the coming years - a move that has drawn strong criticism from public sector employees, who cautioned that a leaner federal workforce would slow government operations.The budget was first put forward in early November and has already survived two votes.Debate around it had been partially eclipsed by partisan drama between Carney's Liberals and the Conservative opposition, who lost a member of their caucus to the Liberals shortly after the fiscal plan was proposed.Canada's Carney welcomes MP who defected to the LiberalsConservatives accuse Carney of being 'undemocratic' as MP resignsChris d'Entremont of Nova Scotia said he defected over what he believed was Poilievre's \"negative\" style of politics. He added that the Liberal budget \"hits the priorities\" of his constituents. Another Conservative lawmaker, Matt Jeneroux of Alberta, later resigned from parliament that same week, saying he did so to spend more time with family.The departures fuelled questions about Poilievre's leadership. On Wednesday, he told reporters that he planned to stay on as leader.\"My plan is to continue to lead and be the only leader that's fighting for an affordable Canada where our people who work hard can afford a home and food,\" Poilievre said.

    "body": "18 hours agoNardine Saadin Los AngelesUS film superstar Tom Cruise has received his first ever Oscar statuette.Cruise, 63, accepted an honorary Oscar at the annual Governors Awards in Hollywood alongside singer-philanthropist Dolly Parton, choreographer Debbie Allen and production designer Wynn Thomas.\"Making films is not what I do, it is who I am,\" the four-fold Oscar nominee said on Sunday, accompanying his long-awaited Academy Awards honour with an acceptance speech about his love of cinema.The Top Gun and Mission: Impossible actor paid tribute to film-makers in front of and behind the lens, those he has worked with during his 45-year career, as well as the power of the movies.Upon taking the stage, Cruise received a minutes-long standing ovation and raucous round of applause from film luminaries in the audience, including Steven Spielberg, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jerry Bruckheimer.Film-maker Alejandro G Iñárritu, who is directing an upcoming Cruise film, presented the actor with the Governors Award. \"The cinema, it takes me around the world,\" Cruise said in his speech. \"It helps me to appreciate and respect differences. It shows me also our shared humanity, how alike we are in so, so many ways. \"And no matter where we come from, in that theatre, we laugh together, we feel together, we hope together, we dream together. And that is the power of this art form. \"And that is why it matters, that is why it matters to me. So making films is not what I do, it is who I am.\"Cruise made his film debut in 1981 and was previously nominated for best actor for Born on the Fourth of July and Jerry Maguire. He was also nominated as best supporting actor in the film Magnolia and for producing Top Gun: Maverick.The Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences selected Cruise for his \"incredible commitment to our film-making community, to the theatrical experience, and to the stunts community\", the organisation said.The Risky Business actor told the ceremony that cinema made the world much larger than the one that he knew as a child. \"It opened my eyes. It opened my imagination to the possibility that life could expand far beyond the boundaries that I then perceived in my own life. And that beam of light opened a desire to open the world, and I have been following it ever since.\"The actor, who famously performs his own stunts, has also been a fervent advocate for cinema as the streaming industry and social media compete for viewers' time and attention.\"I want you to know that I will always do everything I can to help this art form, to support and champion new voices, to protect what makes cinema powerful - hopefully without too many more broken bones.\"Notably, earlier this year Cruise was reportedly set to be recognised by US President Donald Trump when he announced his picks for this year's Kennedy Center honours but the actor declined due to scheduling conflicts.",

    "body": "A South African man who was seen attending a neo-Nazi rally outside an Australian state parliament has been taken into immigration detention after his visa was revoked.Matthew Gruter, who has been in Australia since 2022, took part in an anti-Jewish protest outside the New South Wales parliament organised by the National Socialist Network earlier this month and is now awaiting deportation.He was seen among around 60 men clad in black, who held up a banner that said \"Abolish the Jewish lobby\", Australian media report.Australia has seen a recent rise in right-wing extremism. Its government made the Nazi salute punishable by a mandatory prison term earlier this year.Australia's Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said Mr Gruter's visa had been cancelled on character grounds, adding that those who attended the rally were not \"patriotic\".\"Multicultural Australia and modern Australia are the same thing... They hate modern Australia,\" he said.Mr Gruter was detained in the early hours of Tuesday, and would have \"very limited\" options to appeal the decision as it was made at a ministerial level, Burke added.The minister had earlier said that anyone on a visa in Australia should consider themselves a guest of the country.\"Like with any household, if a guest turns up to show hatred and wreck the household, they can be told it's time to go home.\"Mr Gruter moved to Australia with his wife and works as a civil engineer, according to ABC News. The National Socialist Network, which organised the rally on 8 November, is a well-known neo-Nazi group in Australia.Demonstrators repeatedly chanted \"blood and honour\", a slogan associated with the Hitler Youth, according to ABC News.New South Wales Premier Chris Minns described the rally, which lasted about 20 minutes, as a \"shocking display of hatred and racism and antisemitism\".Sarah Schwartz, executive officer of the Jewish Council of Australia, told ABC News that neo-Nazi groups were a threat to multiculturalism in the country and there needed to be a distinction between peaceful protests and \"hateful stunts\".\"They're acts of hate speech, and they should be considered as such,\" she said.Additional reporting by Lana Lam in Sydney",

    "body": "4 hours agoJon DonnisonCorrespondent, JerusalemAt least 94 Palestinian prisoners and detainees have died in Israeli custody in less than two years, a well-regarded Israeli human rights group says.A new report by Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI) alleges a practice of \"systematic killings and cover-ups\".The report covers the period between 7 October 2023, when Hamas launched its deadly attack on Israel, sparking the latest conflict in Gaza, and 31 August 2025. It said fewer than 30 Palestinians died in Israeli custody in the 10 years prior.The Israel Prison Service (IPS) told the BBC it \"operates in accordance with the law and under the supervision of official oversight bodies\".It said it did not comment on figures or allegations from outside bodies.\"All inmates are held according to legal procedures, and their rights including access to medical care, hygiene, and adequate living conditions are upheld by professionally trained staff,\" the IPS added.Since 7 October 2023, thousands of Palestinians have been detained across Gaza and the West Bank, many without charge.PHRI said it had exposed a deeply concerning pattern of systematic human rights violations committed against Palestinians detained by Israel and classified as \"security prisoners\".It said this was carried out as part of an official policy implemented by Israeli authorities since the war began.Israeli authorities have stopped providing information about Palestinians in custody to the Red Cross and barred access to detention facilities.PHRI said its report is based on official records and data cross-referenced with forensic reports, information from other human rights groups and efforts to locate specific people, as well as testimony from detainees, their families and lawyers.Its authors say 52 of those who died were being held in military prisons while 42 died in civilian jails run by the IPS.PHRI says the deaths were caused by physical violence, medical neglect, or both.It singles out the policies of Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel's right-wing national security minister and a key member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government.PHRI said that, under Ben-Gvir's control, Israel's incarceration facilities holding Palestinians had \"effectively been transformed into sites of torture and abuse\".It added daily physical violence was widespread, and that the deprivation of human rights and systematic torture had resulted in the deaths of dozens of Palestinians.The highest number of deaths, 29, occurred at the Sde Teiman military prison in Southern Israel, near Gaza.Five Israeli reservist soldiers have been charged with aggravated abuse and causing serious bodily harm, after a Palestinian prisoner was allegedly beaten and stabbed in the rectum with a sharp object at Sde Teiman in July 2024.Footage emerged showing reserve soldiers taking a detainee aside and surrounding him with riot shields before he was allegedly attacked. The five reservists deny the charges and have not been named.The alleged assault has divided the nation, with some right-wing politicians criticising a military police investigation and even some \"right to rape\" protests outside the jail.The PHRI report accuses the Israeli authorities of trying to \"cover up\" and suppress investigations into Palestinian deaths and alleged abuses in custody.In said that, in many cases, detainees' family members were not notified that their relatives had died and access to post-mortems was denied.The report also said there had been a failure to prosecute Israeli prison staff and soldiers.It examined a policy of what it called \"forced disappearance\", through which thousands of Palestinians have been detained without their families being notified or told where their relatives are being held.PHRI said these \"grave violations of international law\" had made determining the full scope of Israel's prisoner policy and the fate of the many Palestinians taken into custody extremely difficult, if not impossible.The group estimates the actual number of Palestinians killed could be higher than the number it has been able to document.The IPS said \"the claims described do not reflect the conduct or procedures of the Israel Prison Service, and we are not aware of the incidents as presented\".It continued: \"Every death in IPS custody is examined in accordance with established procedures and referred to the competent authorities as required.\"For reasons of privacy, security, and legal limitations, the IPS does not provide personal or statistical details regarding inmates, nor does it comment on individual cases.\"The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it operates \"in accordance with Israeli and international law\", and \"detains individuals in Gaza when there is reasonable suspicion of their involvement in terrorist activities\".It said that, in some cases, criminal proceedings were then initiated, while in others \"preventive detention is enforced to remove individuals from the fighting, in full alignment with the Israeli law and the Geneva Conventions\". \"Detention orders and their duration are subject to judicial review as required by law,\" it added.The IDF said it was aware of incidents of detainees dying in custody, but that these included people detained with existing illness or injury, adding each death was investigated by military police.",

    "body": "Ex-Harvard president Larry Summers steps back from public role after Epstein email release5 hours agoMax MatzaReutersFormer Harvard University president Larry Summers has said he will step back from public commitments after his emails with disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein were made public.\"I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognise the pain they have caused,\" he said in a statement to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. Emails released by a House committee last week show Summers, a former US treasury secretary, communicated with Epstein until the day before the Epstein's 2019 arrest for the alleged sex trafficking of minors.On Tuesday, House members are expected to vote on a measure calling for the release of all Epstein-related files that have yet to be made public.The measure would then head to the Senate, and require the approval of US President Donald Trump.Summers served as treasury secretary under former President Bill Clinton and director of the National Economic Council under former President Barack Obama. He was president of Harvard from 2001 to 2006 and is currently a professor there.He wrote in his statement on Monday: \"I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein.\"He added that he wanted \"to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me\".\"While continuing to fulfil my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort,\" Summers wrote.The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington where Summers was a senior fellow, also announced on Monday that he was no longer affiliated with the organisation.Summers is still listed as a member of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI's board, which he joined in 2023 following a failed attempt to oust its chief executive Sam Altman. The BBC has contacted OpenAI and a representative for Summers about whether he will remain a director at the company.Summers' move comes after the US Department of Justice announced that it would investigate Epstein's \"involvement and relationship\" with former President Bill Clinton, who was also a friend of Epstein, and several other prominent Democrats.Clinton has strongly denied he had any knowledge of Epstein's crimes. The department's decision came at the urging of Trump, who also asked for Summers, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and banks JP Morgan and Chase, to be investigated.Hoffman is yet to comment. A spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase said the firm regretted \"any association\" it had with Epstein, and added that it \"did not help him commit his heinous acts\".Trump was also mentioned in the emails, which do not imply any wrongdoing.\"Epstein was a Democrat, and he is the Democrat's problem, not the Republican's problem!\" he wrote on social media.\"They all know about him, don't waste your time with Trump. I have a Country to run!\"The emails released by the House Oversight Committee last week indicate that Summers and Epstein met for dinner frequently, with Epstein often trying to connect Summers to prominent global figures. At one point, in July 2018, Epstein proposed a meeting with the \"president [sic] of united nations, interesting person for you\".In a separate email just after Trump's first election in 2016, Summers told Epstein to \"spend zero effort on anything about me with Trump\".Due to Trump's \"approach to conflict of interest\", Putin \"proximity\" and \"mindless response\" to Cuban leader Fidel Castro's death, Summers said he was \"best off a million miles away\".A representative for Summers previously told US media that he \"deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein\" after Epstein's conviction in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor.The emails mention many high-profile figures. A review by the Wall Street Journal found Trump was mentioned in more than 1,600 of the 2,324 email threads.Trump has repeatedly said he severed contact with the financier years before Epstein was convicted in 2008, and was unaware of his criminal activity. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.While Trump was discussed in some of the messages released last week, he did not send or receive them.",

    "body": "6 hours agoAndrew HardingParis correspondentA French energy company is facing war crimes allegations, which it denies, over a massacre near its multi-billon dollar international gas project in northern Mozambique in 2021.In a complaint filed with French prosecutors, a human rights group accused TotalEnergies of complicity in war crimes, including the torture and execution of dozens of civilians held by local security forces in a cluster of shipping containers at its facility.Total has always denied responsibility for the actions of government troops and related security forces who were involved in guarding the Afungi peninsula gas refinery development.It was the biggest foreign investment project in Africa at the time.The complaint was filed by the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), a human rights group.\"Companies and their executives are not neutral actors when they operate in conflict zones. If they enable or fuel crimes, they might be complicit and should be held accountable,\" said Clara Gonzales, the ECCHR's co-programme director for business and human rights.The massacre by Mozambican forces took place in resource-rich Cabo Delgado province, where government troops were battling violent Islamist militants, linked to the Islamic State group, with a gruesome reputation for beheading victims.In March 2021, Islamists attacked the besieged town of Palma, where they killed or  kidnapped 1,563 civilians living next to TotalEnergies gas plant on Mozambique's remote northern Afungi peninsula, according to Alex Perry.The investigative journalist first documented the Palma death toll, and the subsequent reprisal massacre at the entrance to Total's compound, for Politico in 2024.Perry called it the \"bloodiest disaster in oil and gas history\".Locals who sought help from the forces at the Total facility were accused of aiding the insurgents. Men were separated from the group by force and held in shipping containers. The exact number of civilians subsequently killed by Mozambican  forces providing security for Total is not clear. Perry identified 97 victims but estimates the true figure could be double that.\"Most people have never heard about any of this, in part because Total has acknowledged none of it. Today is a victory for truth, and accountability,\" Perry told the BBC.The BBC has contacted TotalEnergies for comment. The British government initially offered financial guarantees for UK companies seeking to take part in what was heralded as an unprecedented opportunity for economic development in Mozambique. But after suspending support following the bloodshed in Palma, Britain is now being urged to walk away by environmental campaigners, who say the gravity of the allegations against Total must be a \"red line\" for the financial backers of its liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique.Total continued to \"demonstrate that it has learned nothing from the past: it just announced the lifting of the force majeure on its gas project, despite the dramatic security and humanitarian situation\", Lorette Philippot from Friends of the Earth France said.The UK and Dutch governments must \"refuse to renew their financial support and withdraw from Mozambique LNG\", she added, like French banks Société Générale and Crédit Agricole.Supporters of TotalEnergies' determination to proceed with the vast project in Cabo Delgado say it is a bold investment that could bring huge rewards to a neglected region of Africa.But critics say it is an environmental, ethical and financial disaster. They draw links between Total's actions and struggles and those of another giant French company, Lafarge, which went on trial in France this month, along with eight former employees, over allegations that it paid jihadist groups in Syria to keep a cement plant there in operation.",

    "body": "COP30 host Brazil has created 10 new Indigenous territories, with the climate summit hit by protests in recent days.The designation means the areas, including one in part of the Amazon, will have their culture and environment protected under Brazilian law - though this is not always enforced.The move follows similar actions from President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, whose government recognised Indigenous possession of 11 territories last year. The latest measure will be formalised through a presidential decree.It comes as thousands have protested at the UN's annual climate conference, with some carrying signs reading \"demarcation now\".Earlier last week, demonstrators - some of whom were from Indigenous groups - carrying signs that read \"our forests are not for sale\" broke into the summit and tussled with security.Security around the conference has since increased noticeably, with more armed soldiers and police at the entrance. Lots of Indigenous groups do not have accreditation to go inside.More than 200 human rights groups wrote to UN officials on Monday criticising the enhanced security, saying it \"contributes to an increasing global trend towards the silencing of dissent, militarised response to protest, and marginalisation of those defending land and the environment\".Past recognition of Indigenous reserves banned mining and logging, as well as restricting commercial farming, in the areas they covered to prevent deforestation. Expanding the total area considered Indigenous territory could prevent up to 20% of additional deforestation and reduce carbon emissions by 26% by 2030, according to a study by the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil, the Amazon Environmental Research Institute and the Indigenous Climate Change Committee.The new protected areas span hundreds of thousands of hectares and are inhabited by thousands of people from the Mura, Tupinambá de Olivença, Pataxó, Guarani-Kaiowá, Munduruku, Pankará, and Guarani-Mbya indigenous peoples.One area overlaps more than 78% with the Amazon National Park, part of the bio-diverse rainforest which plays a crucial role in regulating the global climate and storing carbon.The Brazilian government's announcement came on Indigenous Peoples' Day at COP30 on Monday.Until the left-wing Lula re-entered office, no new Indigenous lands had been declared since 2018, it said.Under his far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, who promoted mining on Indigenous lands, the protections afforded to them were frequently not enforced.Lula's government has previously taken action to drive out illegal miners from indigenous lands.Currently, Indigenous lands encompass 117.4 million hectares - roughly equivalent to the size of Colombia, or around 13.8% of Brazil's territory. Hundreds of Indigenous groups live in Brazil, according to the country's census.The Amazon rainforest is already at risk of a renewed surge in deforestation as efforts grow to overturn a key ban to protect it. Thick and healthy forestry helps pull carbon out of the atmosphere.Carbon released through the burning of fossil fuels has contributed to climate change.Countries are gathering at COP30 in an effort to reach agreements on how to try to limit global average temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and keep them \"well below\" 2C.The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says a large body of scientific evidence shows that warming of 2C or more would bring serious consequences, including extreme heat, higher sea levels and threats to food security.",

    "body": "'I hated that I looked Asian': KPop Demon Hunters star on her struggle for acceptance16 hours agoChi Chi Izundu & Rebecca ThornBBC Global WomenBBCArden Cho stars as the voice of Rumi in KPop Demon Hunters, which topped Netflix charts in 93 countries\"I hated that I looked Asian, that I didn't have blue eyes and blonde hair, because that's what was beautiful at the time,\" says Arden Cho, the actress who voiced Rumi, star of Netflix's chart-topping animated film, KPop Demon Hunters.Speaking to the BBC World Service for the Global Women series, Cho, 40, is describing her childhood in Texas, as the eldest daughter of Korean immigrant parents and her struggle for acceptance in American society.In the film, which tells the story of a female K-Pop trio who must save the world from evil forces, Rumi has to come to terms with her identity as part human, part demon - and when Cho first read the script this resonated powerfully.\"Being born in America, feeling American but having people treat me like I'm not, trying to figure out my identity as an Asian-American, as a Korean-American, as a woman,\" she says.These were all elements of her early life that mirrored Rumi's journey.\"I can honestly say that at different points in my life, I hated a lot of myself and I wanted to be someone else.\"As kids, what you see shapes who you become and I feel like I just didn't see enough people that look like me.\"NetflixCho says the film has led to \"Korea being loved\" more than ever beforeWhen it launched on Netflix in June, KPop Demon Hunters registered 33 million views in just two weeks, and reached the top 10 of the Netflix charts in 93 countries. To star in the first Hollywood animated film set in Korea, with Korean leads, was for Cho \"a dream come true\" – but it has also made her a powerful role model for Asian-American children, of the kind that she lacked when she was young.Cho says many Korean-Americans have told her it's \"such a refreshing moment\", making them proud for the first time of their dual heritage and culture.\"I feel like K-Pop really, truly, has paved the way. K-beauty has had such a big impact on Korea being loved. But I feel like this movie is the one that tipped it over the edge of, everybody wants to go to Korea, now,\" Cho says.But the film's success was not guaranteed and Cho says she felt the team making it were \"sometimes facing an uphill battle\".\"I feel like it kind of sucks to say this, but any time there's an Asian-led project, people feel like it's a risk,\" she says.So, when she took on the role, she made an effort to meet everyone working on the film in person, she says.Getty ImagesJi-Young Yoo (left) and May Hong (right) are also voice actors in the filmThe film was released against the backdrop of increased immigration raids in the US as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation effort, targeting those who are in the country illegally, which sparked protests in many states.As an Asian-American living in the US \"it's heartbreaking and disappointing,\" says Cho. \"Immigrants have made America what it is.\"Korean news sources have estimated that up to 150,000 Korean immigrants without proper documentation, including adopted children, are among those who could be deported.Cho says that when she was younger, people didn't know what it meant to be Korean in the USAs an adult, Cho came to realise that the racism she had experienced when she was younger stemmed mainly from a lack of education, as people didn't know what it meant to be Korean or Asian.\"But now in this day and age, when I feel like the world and people should know better, it is beyond disappointing and sometimes I feel like we feel so hopeless,\" she says.Because of this, it feels very special, she says, that KPop Demon Hunters could bring \"hope and joy and love to all these different communities\".\"Maybe that's why it's sort of like this movie of the summer, because we just needed some hope and something to unite us all together.\"The growth of AI is a major concern for the film industry, raising the possibility that in future it could be used to make a film like KPop Demon Hunters.Cho says she is aware that AI is already being used to replicate actors' voices, but wants to \"have hope in humanity\" that people will still seek out art created by humans.\"Sure, I'm sure they're going to have AI actors and singers. I know they already exist. I know our voices are already being manipulated, but I hope people have some respect and want and love for something real.\"KPop Demon Hunters has also been dominating the global music charts, with seven tracks from its soundtrack featured on the Billboard Hot 100. It has its own fan art, and audiences around the world are demanding a sequel.Cho tells us she wishes she could answer the question of whether that will happen - but both she and fans will have to wait for Netflix or Sony Pictures Entertainment, which made the film, to give it the green light.\"I know there's lots of murmurs, I've heard wonderful things,\" she says. \"So we shall see, and I think everyone in the world would riot if there wasn't.\"Starting conversations, building connections and challenging misinformation through features, investigations, interviews and extraordinary stories",

    "body": "21 hours agoJaroslav Lukiv and James Waterhouse,Ukraine correspondent in BrusselsUkraine will receive up to 100 of France's Rafale F4 fighter jets as well as advanced air defence systems in a major deal to boost Kyiv's ability to protect itself against deadly Russian attacks.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the move as \"historic\", after signing the letter of intent with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron at an air base near Paris.Deliveries of the Rafale F4s are planned to be completed by 2035, while the joint production of interceptor drones is starting this year.Financial details are yet to be worked out, but reports say France plans to attract EU financing and also access frozen Russian assets - a controversial move that has split the 27-member bloc.\"This is a strategic agreement which will last for 10 years starting from the next year,\" Zelensky said at a joint briefing with Macron on Monday.Ukraine will also get \"very strong French radars\", eight air defence systems and other advanced weaponry, he added.Zelensky stressed that using such advanced systems \"means protecting someone's life... this is very important\".Russia has in recent months increased its drone and missile attacks on Ukraine, targeting energy and rail infrastructure and causing massive blackouts across the country. Dozens of civilians have been killed in the strikes, in what Kyiv and its Western allies describe as war crimes. In the latest overnight Russian missile attack, three people were killed and 15 injured in the north-eastern city of Balakliya, local officials said.Speaking alongside Zelensky, Macron said: \"We're planning Rafales, 100 Rafales - that's huge. That's what's needed for the regeneration of the Ukrainian military.\"The French president added that he wanted to help Ukraine prepare for whatever was coming next.These fighter jets are seen as crucial to protecting Ukraine's skies, because the country is almost powerless in preventing long-range air strikes on its border towns and cities.\"The Russians are using 6,000 glide bombs per month,\" Serhiy Kuzhan, a Ukrainian defence analyst, told the BBC. \"It would be important to have a French air-to-air system, with a 200km range, because Russians have their own system with a range of 230km.\"While this announcement between Kyiv and Paris is sizeable, Justin Bronk from the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) pointed out: \"The difference they'll make will depend on the timeframe and the missiles that come with them.\"This is a long-term political agreement rather than a detailed purchase order, so few are expecting this announcement to dramatically change the dynamics of Russia's grinding invasion.The promises of Western military hardware are also only as effective as the training and logistics they come with. Whether it's a German-made Leopard 2 tank or an American F-16 fighter jet, they all require intensive training, sizable support crews and a lot of spare parts.With the Rafales, further complexities arise around the question of who pays. It's thought France will dip into its own budget contributions for Kyiv, as well as look at joint EU borrowing mechanisms to help pay for the deal.But what you hear privately admitted in EU's corridors of power in Brussels is that the money is slowing running out.The bloc has agreed to help support Ukraine's battered economy for the next two years, but there is less consensus on whether to unlock €140bn ($162bn; £123bn) of frozen Russian assets to help support Ukraine financially and militarily.The proposals are currently illegal under international law, and some members are nervous about the prospect of having to pay Russia back when the war ends.Ukraine's air force is already using France's Mirage warplanes as well as US-made F-16s. Kyiv has also recently provisionally agreed to obtain Swedish Gripen fighter jets.After France, Zelensky will travel to Spain to seek further military and other support for Ukraine. Over the weekend, he secured a gas deal with Greece. Vital supplies of US liquefied natural gas are now expected to start flowing into Ukraine this winter via a pipeline across the Balkans.Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukraine's territory. Russian troops have been making slow advances along the vast front line - despite reported huge combat casualties.",

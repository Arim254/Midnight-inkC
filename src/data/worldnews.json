    "body": "4 hours agoMichael Sheils McNameeBusiness reporterGetty ImagesA Paris court has rejected an effort by the French government to suspend the website of fast-fashion giant Shein in response to it selling childlike sex dolls on its platform.The court said the request for a three-month suspension was \"disproportionate\" - but did order age verification for the sale of adult products.The action against Shein was taken after France's consumer watchdog last month reported it to authorities for selling \"sex dolls with a childlike appearance\" and weapons. Shein said its priority remained protecting French consumers and ensuring compliance.The court acknowledged the seriousness of selling the childlike sex dolls and weapons in its judgement, but said these had been isolated incidents. It noted that the Chinese company had taken action to remove the offending items once it had been made aware of them, and that the issues related to a small number of the hundreds of thousands of products on sale on its site. In response to the initial controversy, Shein announced it would be banning the sale of all sex dolls on its site internationally. A request by the French government for Shein to be forced to suspend the sale of third-party items on its website - the source of the initial offending items - was also rejected. In ordering age verification measures to be put in place for the sale of adult items, the court said the fine for each breach would be €10,000 (£8,700; $11,700). The decision to suspend Shein's website in early November coincided with the company opening its first physical store in the French capital. Its launch drew both shoppers and protesters, with opposition related to the sale of childlike sex dolls, and also its profile as a fast-fashion retailer. Shein said in a statement: \"We remain committed to continuously improving our control processes, in close collaboration with the French authorities, with the aim of establishing some of the most stringent standards in the industry.\"Our priority remains protecting French consumers and ensuring compliance with local laws and regulations.\"",

    "description": "The Australian government has announced a gun buyback scheme in the wake of the Bondi Beach attack - its deadliest mass shooting in decades.The scheme",
    "body": "The Australian government has announced a gun buyback scheme in the wake of the Bondi Beach attack - its deadliest mass shooting in decades.The scheme is the largest since the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, which left 35 people dead and prompted Australia to introduce world-leading gun control measures.Fifteen people were killed and dozens injured on Sunday when two gunmen, believed to have been motivated by \"Islamic State ideology\", opened fire on a Jewish festival at the country's most iconic beach.On Friday, police also said there was no ongoing reason to detain a group of men who were arrested in Sydney over their \"extremist Islamic ideology\".Police allege Sunday's attack, which they have declared a terrorist incident, was committed by a father-son duo. Naveed Akram, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act. His father Sajid was killed during the attack.The day after the shooting, national cabinet - which includes representatives from the federal government and leaders from all states and territories - agreed to tighten gun controls.Speaking to media on Friday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said there are now more than 4 million firearms in Australia - more than at the time of the Port Arthur massacre.\"We know that one of these terrorists held a firearm licence and had six guns, in spite of living in the middle of Sydney's suburbs... There's no reason why someone in that situation needed that many guns. \"If you're going to reduce the number of guns, then a buyback scheme has to be a piece of that puzzle,\" Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett added.The new scheme will purchase surplus, newly banned and illegal firearms, and will be funded on a 50-50 basis with the states and territories. Hundreds of thousands of firearms will be collected and destroyed, the government estimates.National cabinet has also agreed to impose limits on the number of firearms held by any one individual, restrict open-ended firearms licensing and the types of guns that are legal and make Australian citizenship a condition of holding a firearm licence. Work on a national firearms register will be accelerated and firearm regulators will have better access to criminal intelligence.On Friday, New South Wales Police said they were preparing to release seven men with extremist ideology, but that they would continue to be monitored.Tactical officers swarmed on the group, who had travelled from Victoria and were known to police there, in dramatic scenes in the suburb of Liverpool on Thursday. Officers found a knife, but no guns or other weapons.NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told a press conference there is \"no confirmed link\" between the alleged terrorists and the detained group, but that Bondi Beach was one of several locations the latter was intending to visit.\"Whilst this specific threat posed by the males is unknown, I can say that the potential [for] a violent offence being committed was such that we were not prepared to tolerate the risk,\" Commissioner Lanyon said.",

    "body": "At least three people have been killed and nine others injured as a knife-wielding attacker ‍went ‍on a ​rampage in the Taiwanese capital Taipei.The 27-year-old suspect set off smoke bombs at Taipei's main metro station, before running to another station in a busy shopping district, stabbing people along the way, Taiwanese Premier Cho Jung-tai said. The suspect, named by officials as Taiwanese man Chang Wen, later died after falling from a multi-storey building, Cho added. His motive remains unclear.Attacks of this kind are rare in Taiwan, which has low rates of violent crime. The last time a similar incident struck Taipei was more than a decade ago in 2014.Friday's attack took place during the city's evening rush hour.Videos shared on social media showed people fleeing the scene in panic as an individual wearing a baseball cap and black clothing lobbing smoke bombs across a busy road.He can then be seen carrying a large knife as he walks past cars. Cho said the suspect had detonated smoke bombs and Molotov cocktails at Taipei's Main Station, which is connected to a busy underground shopping street. A man reportedly tried to stop the attacker but was struck with a blunt object and later died in hospital.The suspect then went to another subway about 800m away, Zhongshan metro station, where he set off more smoke bombs and stabbed more people.Cho said he had ordered increased security at metro and railway stations, as well as airports, in response to the attack.\"We will ‌investigate [the suspect's] background and associated relationships to understand his motives and ‍determine ‌if there are other connected factors,\" Cho was quoted by news agency Reuters as saying. Taiwan's President William Lai also promised a swift investigation. The last major incident of this kind, in 2014, saw a man kill four people on an underground train in Taipei, shocking people in Taiwan. The perpetrator of that attack was executed two years later.",

    "body": "8 minutes agoCachella SmithEPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockThe Trevi Fountain is one of Rome's key attractions with around nine million visitors this yearTourists in Italy's capital Rome will soon have to pay a €2 (£1.75; $2.34) entrance fee if they want to see its famed Trevi Fountain up close.The new barrier for visitors to view the Baroque monument will come into force from 1 February 2026.While the coins tossed into the fountain are donated to charity, the fees collected will go to the city authority to pay for upkeep and managing visitors. The city expects to raise €6.5m a year from the fountain alone.Announcing the move on Friday, Rome's Mayor Roberto ‌Gualtieri was quote by news agency Reuters as saying that \"two euros isn't very much ... and it will lead to less chaotic tourist flows\".The Trevi levy is part of a new tariff system for certain museums and monuments in the Italian capital.Access to a number of sites that currently charge for entry will become free for Rome's residents, such as the Sacred Area of Largo Argentina.At the same time, tourists and non-residents will have to pay to see the Trevi fountain and five other attractions including the Napoleonic Museum.Children under the age of five, and those with disabilities and an accompanying person, will be exempt from the fees.Tourists will still be able to view the Trevi Fountain - built by Italian architect Nicola Salvi in the 18th Century - for free from a distance.The site currently sees an average of 30,000 visitors per day, according to the City of Rome.Following restoration work which took place last year, Gualtieri introduced a queuing system to prevent large crowds massing around the landmark.Access is capped at 400 people at the same time.",

    "body": "1 day agoHugh Schofield,ParisandLaura GozziA former anaesthetist has been jailed for life for intentionally poisoning 30 patients, 12 of them fatally.Frédéric Péchier, 53,  was convicted Friday at the end of a four-month trial in the eastern city of Besançon.In one of France's biggest ever medical malpractice cases, Péchier was found to have introduced chemicals like potassium chloride or adrenaline into the infusion bags of patients. His youngest victim, a four-year-old child, survived two cardiac arrests during a routine tonsil surgery in 2016. The oldest victim was 89.\"You are Doctor Death, a poisoner, a murderer. You bring shame on all doctors,\" said prosecutors last week. \"You have turned this clinic into a graveyard.\"The chemicals Péchier added triggered cardiac arrest or haemorrhaging in patients, which required emergency intervention in the operating theatre.This was often provided by Péchier himself, who was then able to pose as the patient's saviour.But in 12 cases he was unable to intervene, or it was too late, and the patient died.The prosecution argued that Péchier acted in order to discredit fellow anaesthetists against whom he bore a grudge.In most of the operations, he was not the primary anaesthetist. It was alleged he came in early to the clinic to tamper with the infusion bags.Then, when things went wrong, he was able to step in after diagnosing the problem and ordering an antidote.Péchier was first placed under investigation eight years ago, when he was suspected of poisoning patients at two clinics in Besançon between 2008 and 2017. The alert was raised in 2017 after a surfeit of potassium chloride was found in the infusion bag of a woman who had a heart attack while being operated on for a back complaint.Investigators found a pattern of \"serious adverse events\" at the Saint-Vincent private clinic in Besançon. While the national average for fatal heart attacks under anaesthetic was 1 in 100,000, at the clinic it was more than six times that.And in most cases nationally, an explanation for the heart attack was subsequently found, whereas at Saint-Vincent the cause remained a mystery.It was also found that the \"serious adverse events\" ceased when Péchier left for a short period to work at another clinic, which itself then saw an uptick. Then when he returned to Saint-Vincent, the emergencies resumed there. When he was disbarred from practising in 2017, the anomaly stopped.Péchier's first known victim, Sandra Simard, was 36 when she experienced a sudden cardiac arrest in the middle of spine surgery. She survived thanks to intervention by Péchier, although she went into a coma. Tests on her infusion bags showed concentrations of potassium 100 times the expected dose and the alarm was sounded with local prosecutors. During the 15 weeks of the trial, Péchier sometimes acknowledged that some of the patients who fell ill or died may have been poisoned but he denied any wrongdoing. \"I have said it before and I'll say it again: I am not a poisoner... I have always upheld the Hippocratic oath,\" he stated. Péchier will now spend a minimum of 22 years behind bars, having been at liberty throughout the trial.He has 10 days to lodge an appeal, which would entail a second trial within a year.According to the trial prosecutor: \"His colleagues said he always seemed to have the answer. That he made himself out to be the best, that he created this character of the saviour, so that colleagues would instinctively turn to him.\"Péchier denied the charges and his lawyers argued that there was no hard proof linking him to the crimes. But his own testimony varied in the trial, and he ended up admitting there must have been a poisoner at large in the clinic, but it was not him.The son of two parents in the medical profession, Péchier was described by a court psychologist as having a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde personality – one side respectable, the other side capable of doing great harm. In 2014 and again in 2021 he made attempts to kill himself.A divorced father of three children, he told the court before the verdict that his sole concern was to protect his family. His children wept as the sentence was read but he remained impassive.\"It's the end of a nightmare,\" said survivor Sandra Simard. Another patient who survived, Jean-Claude Gandon, said: \"We can have an easier Christmas now.\"",

    "body": "1 day agoPritti MistryBusiness reporterThe firm behind President Donald Trump's Truth Social platform is merging with a Google-backed energy company in a deal valued at more than $6bn (£4.4bn).Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) and TAE Technologies announced the plans on Thursday in a joint statement, which said the move would \"create one of the world's first publicly traded fusion companies\".Fusion power is a method of generating energy from heat released by nuclear fusion reactions. It could release vast amounts of energy with little associated radioactivity.The statement said the combined company planned to begin constructing the \"world's first utility-scale fusion power plant\" next year, with further plants to follow.Under the merger both firms will have an equal 50% share in ownership after the deal is completed, which is expected by mid-2026 pending regulatory and shareholder approvals.The combined company will have a nine-member board including Trump Media's current chief executive Devin Nunes, who will be co-chief executive of the new firm, and the president's son Donald Trump Jr.TAE Technologies provides technology for energy storage and power delivery systems for batteries and electric vehicles. Its umbrella organisation, TAE Life Sciences, develops technologies and drugs for treating cancer patients.The tie-up with the firm signals a bold and surprising shift for Trump Media, as it moves from social media and financial offerings into the energy sector. Mr Nunes said his firm was \"taking a big step forward toward a revolutionary technology that will cement America's global energy dominance for generations\". Calling fusion power the \"most dramatic energy breakthrough\" since the 1950s, he said Trump Media would bring \"the capital and public market access\" to help make TAE's technology commercial viable. As part of the agreement, Trump Media is to provide up to $200m (£149m) of cash to TAE Technologies when completion of the deal is signed. An additional $100m (£74.7m) will be available once the transaction has been registered.Surging electricity demand for AI data centers has revived interest in cleaner and reliable nuclear power, including restarting shuttered reactors, expanding existing ones and signing contracts for future small modular reactors.The joint statement said TAE Technologies had raised more than $1.3bn of funding from other investors including Google and Goldman Sachs.Trump Media, which mainly generates revenue from advertising on the Truth Social platform, has consistently clocked losses since it began. It posted a decline in revenue and a loss of $54.8m (£40.9m) in the third quarter ending September.",

    "body": "The widow of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has said the Turning Point USA organisation he founded will help elect JD Vance as president in 2028, despite the current US vice-president having yet to announce he is running.Erika Kirk's endorsement on Thursday came on the opening day of Turning Point's annual America Fest conference, the organisation's largest gathering since her husband was shot dead in September.\"We are going to get my husband's friend, JD Vance, elected for 48 in the most resounding way possible,\" Kirk said, referring to the 48th president. Trump is the 47th.Vance, meanwhile, is scheduled to speak at the event on Sunday.Turning Point has been credited with helping Republican President Donald Trump expand his coalition of support, leading to his 2024 presidential election victory.Her announcement ahead of Trump's one-year mark in office signals early jockeying to be his successor ahead of the 2028 election.After Kirk gave her opening remarks, the stage at the Phoenix Convention Center in Arizona turned into a political mudslinging contest as tensions within the conservative movement were laid bare.Podcaster Ben Shapiro lobbed attacks at media rivals Candace Owens, Tucker Carlson, Megyn Kelly and Steve Bannon, calling them \"fraudsters and grifters\".  \"The people who refused to condemn Candace's truly vicious attacks - and some of them are speaking here tonight - are guilty of cowardice,\" Shapiro said.Owens, a former Turning Point employee who hosts a popular podcast, has been a thorn in Republicans' side and pushed various conspiracy theories, including baseless suggestions about Charlie Kirk's murder. It comes at a time when there has been growing speculation about Trump's hold on the Republican party and infighting among factions of the president's supporters about the future of the Maga movement.Shapiro also criticised former Fox News host Carlson for interviewing Nick Fuentes, a far-right political commentator and Holocaust denier, on his podcast in late October, drawing widespread condemnation. After Shapiro, Carlson took the stage and shot back at Shapiro.\"That guy is pompous,\" Carlson said. \"Calls to deplatform at a Charlie Kirk event? That's hilarious.\"  Charlie Kirk's Turning Point events were known for addressing controversial and divisive topics. Supporters saw it as necessary for free speech. Critics saw it as hate-mongering. Authorities said Charlie Kirk's alleged assassin - Tyler Robinson - told his romantic partner that he killed Kirk because he \"had enough of his hatred\". Erika Kirk told the Turning Point conference: \"You won't agree with everyone on this stage this weekend. And that's okay. Welcome to America.\"Since the assassination, she said, \"we've seen fractures, we've seen bridges being burned that shouldn't be burnt\". Trump has recently encountered a series of setbacks within his Republican party, including a public falling out with his former ally Marjorie Taylor Greene and the impending release of the Epstein files, which a majority of Republicans voted for despite Trump's initial discouragement.The four-day America Fest conference was scheduled to continue through the weekend, with Vance and Donald Trump Jr scheduled as guest speakers on Sunday.

    "body": "3 hours agoBethany BellViennaGetty ImagesFernando P being escorted into the regional court in Aachen, western GermanyA court in the German city of Aachen has sentenced a man to eight-and-a-half years in prison for repeatedly drugging and raping his wife, filming the acts and then posting them online.The man, named only as Fernando P in line with German privacy laws, was found guilty of aggravated rape, grievous bodily harm and violation of personal privacy.The court found the 61-year-old, who is originally from Spain, guilty of sedating and raping his wife at their home for a period of several years from 2018 to 2024.A spokesperson for the court, Katharina Effert, said the man also filmed the abuse and shared it online. \"He uploaded videos of these acts to chat groups and internet platforms, making them available to other users,\" she said.Much of the trial was held behind closed doors to protect the identity of his wife.Her lawyer, Nicole Servaty, told journalists that she \"really had a voice in this proceeding\", adding: \"She was able to testify, to express her feelings and everything that has burdened her.\"She said the ruling could not make up for what happened. \"But it might help a bit to cope with things and process them.\"The verdict is still subject to appeal.Getty ImagesFernando P was seen with his hoodie obscuring his face as he awaited the verdict in courtGerman media say the case bears similarities to the high-profile case in France last year concerning Dominique Pelicot. He was found guilty of secretly drugging his wife, Gisèle, and inviting scores of men to rape her while she was unconscious for years.Gisèle's decision to waive her anonymity and hold a public trial turned her into a feminist icon, celebrated for her powerful testimony and courage.Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office, the BKA, says that the victims of sedation and subsequent sexual abuse are \"almost exclusively women\".It says such crimes \"usually take place by exploiting a relationship of trust\" in marriage, partnerships, families or among close acquaintances.",

    "body": "5 hours agoMalu CursinoGetty ImagesNorway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit will likely need a lung transplant as her health has worsened in recent months, the country's royal household has said.The princess, 52, was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis in 2018. The degenerative disease creates scar tissue that stiffens the lungs making it difficult to breathe and for oxygen to enter the bloodstream.Tests in autumn showed \"a clear worsening\" of her health, the palace said on Friday. \"We are reaching the point where a lung transplant will be necessary,\" Are Martin Holm, head of respiratory medicine at Oslo University Hospital, said.Princess Mette-Marit told public broadcaster NRK that her illness had developed \"faster than I'd hoped\".No decision has been taken yet on whether she will be placed on the transplant waiting list, Dr Holm said. The palace said her doctors had started the process towards an evaluation for lung transplant surgery.In Norway, there are usually between 20 and 40 patients on the waiting list for a lung transplant and Princess Mette-Marit will not be given preferential treatment if she is placed on the list, local media reports.Although she is not yet on a donor list, Dr Holm said her healthcare team was \"undertaking the necessary preparations to ensure that [a transplant] will be possible when the time comes\".The palace said Princess Mette-Marit had \"an increasing need\" for rest and a targeted exercise regimen.However, she had \"expressed a strong interest in continuing to carry out her duties\", it added in a statement on Friday. Her royal duties and engagements will adapted to her ongoing health issues.Dr Holm described pulmonary fibrosis to reporters as a \"dangerous disease\" that often could not be seen because it depended on how sick an individual was. At rest, they might be able to breathe normally, he explained, but when they exert themselves - through exercise, for example - their lungs \"can no longer keep up\".ReutersHiking or skiing - activities Princess Mette-Marit enjoys with her husband, Crown Prince Haakon (left) - are no longer possiblePrincess Mette-Marit's husband, Prince Haakon, Norway's future king, sat beside her for an interview with NRK, in which he explained that she may appear \"perfectly fine\" when sitting still, but said he had noticed her struggling more with breathing.He also said she had less energy and was getting ill more often.Hiking or skiing together - activities the pair enjoy - were no longer possible, the crown prince added.The thought of the transplant alone had been demanding, Mette-Marit said, as she knew it will involve risks. A successful transplant hinges on several factors, including finding the right match and ensuring the body does not reject the new organ.Transplant is seen as a last resort, Dr Holm explained, telling reporters that individuals must be significantly ill and have a limited life expectancy before a lung transplant can be deemed appropriate.News of the princess' deteriorating health comes months after her eldest son was charged with 32 offences, including four counts of rape.Marius Borg Høiby, 28, denies the most serious accusations against him, but plans to plead guilty to some lesser charges when the trial begins, his lawyer Petar Sekulic told news agency Reuters in August.Mr Høiby is the stepson of the heir to the Norwegian throne, but does not have any royal title or official duties.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump has suspended the US green card lottery scheme in the wake of a mass shooting at Brown University last week in which two people were killed.The suspect, a Portuguese man who was found dead on Thursday, entered the country through the diversity lottery immigrant visa programme (DV1) in 2017 and was granted a green card.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said she has paused the visa scheme under Trump's direction to \"ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous programme\".US officials said they believe the suspect, 48-year-old Claudio Neves Valente, also killed Portuguese Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Nuno Loureiro earlier this week.The programme makes up to 50,000 visas available each year through a random selection process among entries from countries with low rates of immigration to the US.Writing on social media, Noem said Trump had previously \"fought to end\" the scheme in 2017 after eight people were killed in a truck-ramming attack in New York City.Uzbekistan national Sayfullo Saipov, an Islamic State supporter who is serving multiple life sentences for the attack, entered the US through the DV1 scheme, according to Noem.Her comments come just hours after Valente was found dead in a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire, from what police believe is a self-inflicted gunshot wound.Police said video evidence and tips from the public led investigators to a car rental location where they found the suspect's name and matched him to their person of interest, following a six-day multi-state manhunt.He was found dead with a satchel and two firearms. Evidence in a car nearby matched to the scene of the shooting at Brown University in Providence, according to Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha.Brown University President Christina Paxson said Valente was enrolled at the Ivy League school from the autumn of 2000 to the following spring, and was studying for a PhD in physics.He had \"no current active affiliation\" to Brown, she said.Officials said they believe Valente shot and killed MIT professor Nuno F Gomes Loureiro, 47, on Monday at his home in Brookline, which is about 50 miles (80km) from Providence.Both men had studied at the same university in Portugal in the late 1990s, police said.Officials said the cases were linked when the suspect's vehicle was identified via CCTV footage and a witness at Brown University.The same car was spotted near the scene of the professor's shooting, which happened just two days later.Authorities have not provided any suspected motive for either of the attacks.Two students were killed and nine others were injured as a gunman burst into Brown University's engineering building on 13 December and opened fire during final exams.They have been identified as Ella Cook, 19, a second-year student from Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, 18, an Uzbek-American who had just started at the university.",

    "body": "5 hours agoYolande Knell,Middle East correspondentandDoug FaulknerUN-backed experts say there have been improvements in nutrition and food supplies in Gaza since the ceasefire, but 100,000 people still experienced \"catastrophic conditions\" last month. In August, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) which monitors and classifies global hunger crises said that half a million people - about a quarter of Gaza's population - lived in areas suffering from famine.The UN and other humanitarian agencies have been able to increase food getting into Gaza since October's ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.Israel's foreign ministry said the IPC report was \"deliberately distorted\" and \"doesn't reflect the reality in the Gaza Strip\".The latest IPC analysis suggests that a month ago, half a million Gazans were still facing emergency conditions and more than 100,000 were still under the highest level of food insecurity - IPC Phase 5 - experiencing \"catastrophic conditions\". It projects that number will continue to decrease but stressed the situation remains \"highly fragile\".  IPC Phase 5 signifies the most extreme level of food insecurity, labelled \"famine\" for an area or \"catastrophe\" when referring to households. The report said no areas in Gaza were now classified as \"in famine\".Israel rejected the original findings of famine by the IPC and has continued to criticise its methodology.  Cogat, the Israeli military body which controls Gaza's crossings, said the number of trucks with food aid entering each week went beyond what the UN had determined it needed.\"The report relies on severe gaps in data collection and on sources that do not reflect the full scope of humanitarian assistance,\" the body said in a statement.Responding to the Cogat ctiticism, the IPC said publicly available data from UN sources and Cogat had been used for the analysis. The IPC said acute malnutrition was at critical levels in Gaza City and serious in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis.In the coming months the situation is expected to remain severe but the number of people facing the most severe conditions is predicted to fall to 1,900 by April, according to the report.But it added that, if there were renewed hostilities, the entire Strip would be at risk of famine.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier this month that the second phase of the US-brokered peace plan - which would see Israel withdraw troops further from Gaza and Hamas disarm - was close but key issues still needed to be resolved.The IPC said key drivers of food insecurity included restricted humanitarian access, displacement of more than 730,000 people and the destruction of livelihoods - including more than 96% of crop land in Gaza being destroyed or inaccessible.Israel imposed a total blockade on aid deliveries to Gaza at the start of March this year, which was eased in May, saying it wanted to put pressure on the armed group Hamas to release hostages remaining in Gaza at the time.Ahead of this IPC report, Cogat said the body had not engaged with the US or Israel and its methodology, \"reinforcing a false narrative, driven in part by Hamas-sourced claims\".It also denied Israel was preventing winter and medical supplies from entering the territory and that there was a shortage of drinking water.Unwra, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said that while, the report stated Gaza was no longer in famine, the situation remained \"critical\".\"Overall living conditions in the Gaza Strip are still catastrophic, made worse by the winter weather,\" it said in a statement, adding there must be \"sustained, expanded, and consistent humanitarian and commercial access\".",

    "body": "13 hours agoPeter Hoskins,business reporterandLily Jamali,North America technology correspondentWatch: What does TikTok's deal mean for America's users?TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance has signed binding agreements with American and global investors to operate its business in the US, the video platform's boss told employees on Thursday.Half of the joint venture will be owned by a group of investors including Oracle, Silver Lake and the Emirati investment firm MGX, according to a memo sent by chief executive Shou Zi Chew.The deal, which is set to close on 22 January, would end years of efforts by Washington to force ByteDance to sell its US operations over national security concerns.It is in ​line with a deal unveiled in September, when US President Donald Trump delayed the enforcement of a law that would ban the app unless it was sold.TikTok said in the memo that the deal would enable \"over 170 million Americans to continue discovering a world of endless possibilities as part of a vital global community\".Under the agreement, ByteDance will retain 19.9% of the business, while Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX will hold 15% each.Another 30.1% will be held by affiliates of existing ByteDance investors, according to the memo.The White House previously said that Oracle, which was co-founded by Trump supporter Larry Ellison, will license TikTok's recommendation algorithm as part of the deal.The deal comes after a series of delays.In April 2024, during President Joe Biden's administration, the US Congress passed a law to ban the app over national security concerns, unless it was sold.The law was set to go into effect on 20 January 2025 but was pushed back multiple times by Trump while his administration worked out a deal to transfer ownership.Trump said in September that he had spoken on the phone to China's President Xi Jinping, who he said had given the deal the go-ahead.The platform's future remained unclear after the leaders met face-to-face in October.The app's fate was clouded by ongoing tensions between the two nations on other matters including trade.\"TikTok has become a bargaining chip in the wider US-China relationship,\" said Alvin Graylin, a lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\"With recent softening tensions, Beijing's sign-off on the structure and algorithm licensing now looks less like capitulation and more like calibrated de-escalation, letting both capitals claim a win at home.\" The White House referred the BBC to TikTok when contacted for comment.Oracle and Silver Lake declined to comment. The BBC has contacted MGX for comment.The deal drew critiques from Senate Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon, who said it would not do \"a thing to protect the privacy of American user\".Under the terms, TikTok's recommendation algorithm is set to be retrained on US user data to ensure feeds are free from external manipulation.\"It's unclear that it will even put TikTok's algorithm in safer hands,\" said Wyden.He opposed the 2024 law and was among US lawmakers who lobbied to extend the TikTok deadline in January in a bid to give Congress more time to mitigate threats from China.Some users also expressed caution at the prospect of new investors.Small business owner Tiffany Cianci, who has more than 300,000 followers and nearly four million likes on the platform, said she hopes the incoming investors will maintain the same user experience for entrepreneurs like her.\"I hope small business owners are protected,\" she said.TikTok has said that more than seven million small businesses market their products and services on TikTok in the US.\"I reserve judgement on whether or not we have saved the app for those small businesses,\" Ms Cianci said.She added that she chose TikTok for promotion because the platform offered profit-sharing on terms that are more favourable than what competitors like Meta offered.Over the last year, Ms Cianci has been active in organising protests in Washington and on TikTok aimed at saving the app.",

    "body": "Wiz Khalifa sentenced to nine months jail in Romania for smoking cannabis on stage1 day agoMircea Barbu,BucharestandAndré Rhoden-PaulGetty ImagesA Romanian court has sentenced Wiz Khalifa to nine months in prison for smoking cannabis on stage.The American rapper, real name Thomaz Cameron Jibril, admitted to smoking a joint during his performance at the Beach, Please! festival last year in Costinesti.A Romanian appeals court overturned an earlier fine of 3,600 Romanian lei (£619; $829) for drug possession and ruled the rapper must serve the sentence in custody. However he was sentenced in absentia. Earlier this week he was seen on stage performing with Gunna in California, and on Thursday he posted pictures and clips from his home on streaming platform Twitch and social media.The BBC has approached the ten-time Grammy-nominated artist for comment. Police briefly held and questioned Jibril after the concert on 13 July 2024, and prosecutors later charged him with possession of \"risk drugs\" for personal use.  Romanian investigators said he was in possession of more than 18 grams of cannabis and consumed an additional amount on stage. In a written decision, the Constanța Court of Appeal judges said they overturned the original fine because the artist had sent \"a message of normalisation of illegal conduct\" and thereby encouraged \"drug use among young people\".Calling it an \"ostentatious act\", the judges said the rapper was \"a music performer, on the stage of a music festival well known among young people\" who \"possessed and consumed, in front of a large audience predominantly made up of very young people, an artisanal cigarette\".Jabril said in a post on X a day after the incident that he did not mean to offend the country. \"They [the authorities] were very respectful and let me go. I'll be back soon. But without a big ass joint next time.\" Romanian criminologist Vlad Zaha told BBC News that there was little-to-no chance of the US extraditing Jibril, and described the sentence as \"unusually harsh\". \"Given the defendant's wealth and connections, Romania's lack of real negotiating power on extradition, and the legal and political status of cannabis in the US, it is highly unlikely that Wiz Khalifa will be sent to serve a prison sentence in Constanța, even though a formal judicial request will be submitted to the United States,\" Mr Zaha said. The  artist, known for songs like Black and Yellow, See You Again and Young, Wild & Free, is often pictured smoking on his social media and founded his own marijuana brand in 2016. Cannabis is legal recreational and medical use in some US states, but remains illegal under federal law.",

    "body": "Pope Leo has named Bishop Aldon Ronald Hicks who, like the pope, is from the Chicago area and served in Latin America, as the next archbishop of New York.Bishop Hicks, 58, will lead one of the Roman Catholic Church's most populous and important postings in the US.He replaces retiring Cardinal Timothy Dolan, 75, who was seen as a conservative with close ties to President Donald Trump. Hicks said he accepted his appointment, which was announced on Thursday, with \"an open heart\" and Dolan called it \"an early Christmas gift\" for New Yorkers.Last month, Hicks joined other bishops to condemn the Trump administration's large scale immigration-related arrests as part of its mass deportation agenda.Hicks' early life and pastoral career closely mirror Pope Leo's. He grew up in South Holland, a short distance from Leo's Dolton neighbourhood in the suburb of Chicago. While Pope Leo spent two decades as a missionary in Peru, Hicks worked at an orphanage in El Salvador from 2005 to 2010, according to a biography released by the New York archdiocese. Hicks was appointed bishop of Joliet by Pope Francis in 2020.Like the pope, Hicks has been outspoken about his concerns for immigrants. \"Deeply rooted in our Gospel tradition of loving our neighbor, this letter affirms our solidarity with all our brothers and sisters as it expresses our concerns, opposition, and hopes with clarity and conviction,\" he said, in response to a joint-letter written by US bishops expressing concerns about the situation immigrants in the United States face.\"It is grounded in the Church's enduring commitment to the Catholic social teaching of human dignity and a call for meaningful immigration reform,\" he saidThe Trump administration has carried out large scale immigration arrests in the Chicago area, leading to clashes between federal agents and residents protesting their presence.The bishops' letter comes as churches grapple with how to respond to immigration activity that affects their members. The majority of people at risk of deportation are Christians, with 61% of the at-risk group being Catholics, according to a report by the US Catholic Bishops Conference.Hicks will now leave his position as bishop of Joliet for the ornate sanctuary at St Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan, where he will lead 2.5 million Catholics in the nation's largest city. He will officially be installed at the cathedral on 6 February 2026.His appointment comes a week after Cardinal Dolan, who has served in New York City for about 16 years, announced the archdiocese will set up a $300 million fund to settle claims of clergy sex abuse.\"As a church, we can never rest in our efforts to prevent abuse, to protect children and to care for survivors,\" the incoming archbishop said at a news conference. \"While this work is challenging, it's difficult, it's painful, I hope it will continue to help in the areas of accountability, transparency and healing.\"Cardinal Dolan, of Missouri, announced his resignation in February, as required by church law when bishops turn 75. He was named head of the church in New York by Pope Benedict XVI in 2009, who later made him cardinal.He participated in two conclaves, one that elected Pope Francis in 2013 and the second that elected Leo XIV last May. The cardinal led prayers at both of Trump's inaugurations, and was appointed by the president to the new Religious Liberty Commission earlier this year.",

    "body": "EU agrees €90bn loan for Ukraine but without using Russian assets7 hours agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor,andChris GrahamReutersDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen (left), European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announce the deal at the summit in Brussels European Union leaders have struck a late-night deal to lend Ukraine €90bn (£79bn; $105bn) over the next two years, after failing to agree on using frozen Russian assets.Ukraine was set to run out of cash by next spring, and European Council chief António Costa said the loan would be paid back only when Russia paid reparations for its full-scale war.\"We committed, we delivered,\" said Costa, while Ukrainian Prime Minister Yuliya Svyrydenko praised the deal as \"a decisive step for economic resilience\".A bid to use €210bn in Russian cash frozen in the EU, mainly in Belgium, ultimately failed as leaders could not convince Belgium's prime minister his country would be protected from Russian retaliation.The bulk of the cash is held by Brussels-based Euroclear and interest from the frozen assets is already being paid to Ukraine. Russia has already launched legal action against the clearing house.Russian President Vladimir Putin accused EU leaders of attempted robbery on Friday and Kirill Dmitriev, his envoy in talks with the US, claimed their failure to agree on using the assets was a \"fatal blow\".However, Belgium's Bart De Wever said the deal eventually agreed after almost 17 hours of negotiations was a \"victory for Ukraine, a victory for financial stability... and a victory for the EU\". EU ⁠leaders had avoided \"chaos ‍and ‍division\", he added.Ukraine needs an estimated €137bn over the next two years to cover both its military and its public services, and the EU plan is to cover two-thirds of that.The €90bn that the EU will raise on the capital markets as part of the loan deal will be \"backed by EU budget headroom\" - the margin between actual EU contributions by member states in a year and the maximum the European Commission can spend as part of the budget. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was grateful to European leaders for the \"significant support that truly strengthens our resilience\".Germany's Friedrich Merz had been a strong supporter of the plan to use Russia's frozen assets. Although the idea has not been dropped, the decision to borrow the money against the EU budget instead is seen as a setback for him. Nevertheless, he declared that it \"sends a clear signal from Europe to Putin\".Two countries, Hungary and Slovakia, refused to back the compromise deal, while the Czech Republic said it would not guarantee the loan.Hungary's Viktor Orban, seen as Vladimir Putin's closest partner in the EU, has opposed handing any more money to Ukraine, arguing it prolongs the war, and he has condemned the deal.Viktor Orban/XViktor Orban posted a photo of him in the centre, with Slovakia's Robert Fico on the right and Czech PM Andrej Babis on the left\"It looks like a loan, but the Ukrainians will never be able to pay it back,\" he told reporters. \"It is basically losing money.\"Like Orban, Slovakia's Robert Fico refused to back more funding to allow Ukraine to continue its defence against Russia, but Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis was careful to point out he agreed to the summit's conclusions \"on condition we don't guarantee the loans\".Billionaire populist Babis only just formed a government this week, and his stance is a signficant departure from the previous government's staunch support for Ukraine.The EU summit took place as US talks with Russia were set to continue, spearheaded by US President Donald Trump, who said this week that a solution was closer than ever.Dmitriev is expected to meet Trump envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Miami at the weekend, according to reports.Meanwhile, a Ukrainian delegation is also due in Miami for talks with their US counterparts, days after Kushner and Witkoff met them and European leaders in Berlin.European allies have made a series of proposals to end the war that include a multinational force as part of \"robust security guarantees\" for Ukraine.Putin has criticised the European approach, saying he had already agreed to several compromises at his meeting with Trump in Alaska in August. Praising Trump's \"serious efforts to end this conflict\", the Russian leader said \"the ball is entirely and fully in the court of our Western opponents... the head of the Kyiv regime and its European sponsors\".Putin's demands were largely reflected in an initial US peace plan and include Ukraine handing over large areas of its own territory.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the deal agreed by the EU boosted the Ukrainian position: \"There ​is a chance that these negotiations will be ‌about peace not ‍on ‌Russian terms, but on terms that can somehow be accepted and considered ‍acceptable by all parties ‍to this conflict.\"Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron said he believed it would be \"useful\" for Europe to re-engage with Putin.\"I believe that it's in our interest as Europeans and Ukrainians to find the right framework to re-engage this discussion,\" he said, adding that Europeans should find the means to do so \"in coming weeks\".",

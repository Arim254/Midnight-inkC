    "body": "8 hours agoJessica MurphyUniversal Images Group via Getty ImagesThe Trump administration cannot suspend food aid used by more than 40 million low-income Americans amid the ongoing US government shutdown, two federal judges have ruled. The decisions, issued within moments of each other on Friday by judges in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, said the government must pay for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or Snap, benefits using emergency funds.The Snap programme works by giving people reloadable debit cards that they can use to buy essential grocery items.The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced this week it would not distribute food assistance funds in November due to the shutdown, saying \"the well has run dry\". A family of four on average receives $715 (£540) per month, which breaks down to a little less than $6 (£4.50) per day, per person.The states administer the benefits, using money from the federal government, which has been unfunded and shut down since 1 October. Several states have pledged to use their own funds to cover any shortfall, however the federal government has warned that they will not be reimbursed.Half of US states had sued the Trump administration over its plans to halt funding, hoping to force it to use a roughly $6bn (£4.5bn) emergency contingency fund for  Snap, also known as food stamps.The Massachusetts judge said the administration must access the contingency funding to pay the benefits and had until Monday to report back to the court on whether they will authorise at least partial benefits for November.Massachusetts US District Judge Indira Talwani wrote in her decision that the  states who sued are likely to win in court on their claim that \"Congress intended the funding of SNAP benefits, at a reduced rate if necessary, when appropriated funds prove insufficient\".Judge Talwani also wrote that the Trump administration \"erred in concluding\" that the USDA is blocked by law from tapping the emergency reserves in the contingency fund when there is a lapse in federal funding.The USDA had said those reserves were insufficient to pay full benefits, which cost $8.5bn to $9bn each month. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins had said she would only use the fund for an emergency such as a natural disaster.Even if the government turns to the contingency fund, it would only be able to cover about 60% of beneficiaries in a single month, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a think-tank focused on policies that help low-income families.Judge Talwani has asked the administration to report on Monday whether it will use the fund to pay reduced benefits or if it will pay full benefits for the month by moving money from other programmes, similar to the administration transferring military research funds earlier this month to pay members of the armed forces.Separately in Rhode Island, a lawsuit was brought by a number of US cities and NGOs who sued over what they called the \"unlawful suspension\" of the programme.\"There is no doubt and it is beyond argument that irreparable harm will begin to occur if it hasn't already occurred in the terror it has caused some people about the availability of funding for food, for their family,\" US  District Judge John  McConnell said.The White House and the USDA did not comment on the decisions. The BBC has also contacted the Office of Management and Budget for comment.At a news conference before the rulings were issued, Rollins said \"we're looking at all the options\" when asked whether the administration would comply if courts required it to release funds. On Friday, the group behind the lawsuit filed in Rhode Island said in a statement that the ruling \"is a lifeline for millions of families, seniors, and veterans who depend on SNAP to put food on the table\".\"It reaffirms a fundamental principle: no administration can use hunger as a political weapon.\"Republicans and Democrats have traded blame for the federal shutdown, which will soon enter its second month, and there has not been any meaningful progress toward a deal.",

    "body": "Five people have been charged in connection with the 2023 overdose death of Robert De Niro's grandson and two other 19 year olds. New York authorities accuse the suspects, Bruce Epperson, Eddie Barreto, Grant McIver, John Nicolas, and Roy Nicolas, of running a fentanyl distribution network that sold counterfeit prescription opioid pills through social media to teenagers and young adults in the city. Authorities link the network to the overdose deaths of Leandro De Niro-Rodriguez,  Akira Stein - daughter of Blondie co-founder Chris Stein - and a third unnamed victim.The five are each charged with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute.\"Through their alleged actions, these defendants left behind a trail of irreversible loss that cut short the lives of three teenagers who held boundless potential and who had already made profound, immeasurable impacts on those who knew them,\" said Homeland Security Investigations New York special agent in charge Ricky Patel in a statement on Thursday. Prosecutors allege the five used social media and encrypted messaging apps to sell thousands fentanyl-laced pills in New York between January and July 2023.They allege that over that summer, the drugs they sold led to at least three deaths. Stein was found dead 30 May after taking fentanyl-laced pills she allegedly  purchased from John and Roy Nicolas. The unnamed victim, who died 13 June, allegedly purchased pills through an intermediary from Mr McIver.Authorities say De Niro-Rodriguez, who died 2 July, got pills from a dealer who allegedly obtained them from Mr McIver, Mr Epperson, and Mr Barreto.Separatedly in 2023, a woman was arrested for allegedly selling De Niro-Rodriguez three counterfeit oxycodone pills containing fentanyl - the drugs believed to have led to his death - and tablets of Xanax.In a statement after the death of his grandson, Academy-Award winner De Niro said he was \"deeply distressed\" by the passing of his \"beloved grandson\", who was the only child of his daughter Drena.In a statement on Instagram on Thursday, Chris Stein noted the arrests in his daughter's case and thanked officials \"for this hope of some justice for her\".If found guilty, the charges carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life in prison, officials said.

    "body": "20 hours agoCherylann MollanBBC News, MumbaiIndia and the US have signed a framework agreement to expand defence cooperation over the next 10-years. The pact was announced after a meeting between US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh in Kuala Lumpur. The agreement will enhance \"coordination, information sharing and tech cooperation\" and advance \"regional stability and deterrence\", Hegseth said on X. It comes as the two countries are trying to close a trade deal and tide over tense ties after US President Donald Trump slapped 50% tariffs on India, including a 25% penalty for buying Russian oil and arms. The agreement is expected to provide policy direction to the entire spectrum of the India-US defence relationship. \"It is a signal of our growing strategic convergence and will herald a new decade of partnership. Defence will remain as a major pillar of our bilateral relations. Our partnership is critical for ensuring a free, open and rules-based Indo-Pacific region,\" Singh said, in a post on X. According to Pramit Pal Chaudhuri of the Eurasia Group think tank, the agreement was supposed to have been concluded in July-August this year, but India's irritation at Trump's statements about his role in ending the conflict with Pakistan led to it getting delayed. The pact is the latest in a series of agreements between the two countries that have made it \"easier for the two militaries to achieve interoperability, India to access technology and the two defence sectors to work together\", Mr Chaudhuri said. \"This provides for further potential in all three areas,\" he added. India and the US have been steadily ramping up their defence ties recently. Defence was a major talking point between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump on the former's visit to the US in February this year, withTrump saying the US would increase military equipment sales to India by many billions of dollars,  ultimately paving the way to providing Delhi with F-35 stealth warplanes.But since then, Delhi's dependence on discounted Russian oil as well as its long-standing defence relationship with Moscow have been a major point of irritation for the Trump administration. While Russia continues to be a major supplier of arms to India, its share of Indian defence imports has been steadily falling as Delhi seeks to diversify its portfolio and boost domestic capacity.In recent months India has hinted that it would be open to increasing energy and defence purchases from the US. The two countries are locked in high-stakes trade talks, aimed at reaching a long-awaited deal by November. With inputs from Soutik Biswas, India correspondent with the BBC.",

    "body": "US space agency Nasa has rejected reality star Kim Kardashian's claim that the 1969 space mission to land the first man on the Moon was faked.\"Yes, we've been to the Moon before... 6 times!\" Nasa acting administrator Sean Duffy wrote on social media.Kardashian made the comments on the latest episode of her long-running TV series The Kardashians, telling co-star Sarah Paulson she thought the Moon landing \"didn't happen\".Despite being consistently debunked, conspiracy theories as to whether humans actually reached the Moon have persisted for more than 50 years, particularly with the rise of social media. In the episode, Kardashian can be seen showing Paulson an interview with astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who along with Neil Armstrong took the first steps on the lunar surface during the Apollo 11 mission.\"I'm sending you a million articles with both Buzz Aldrin and the other one,\" Kardashian says, before reading a quote allegedly from Aldrin responding to a question about the scariest moment of the expedition.\"There was no scary moment because it didn't happen. It could've been scary, but it wasn't because it didn't happen,\" she reads.It is unclear which article Kardashian was reading from, or if the quotes were actually from Aldrin.The reality star is later seen telling a producer that she believes the Moon landing was fake.\"I think it was fake. I've seen a few videos on Buzz Aldrin talking about how it didn't happen. He says it all the time now, in interviews. Maybe we should find Buzz Aldrin,\" she says.Following the broadcast, Duffy tagged Kardashian in a post on X, rebuffing her comments, and promoted Nasa's current moon exploration program Artemis, which is \"going back under the leadership\" of Donald Trump.\"We won the last space race and we will win this one too,\" he added.In response, Kardashian wrote back asking about the interstellar object named 3I/Atlas, which astronomers said could be the oldest comet ever seen.\"Wait…. what's the tea on 3I Atlas?!?!!!!!!!?????\" she replied.Duffy later invited Kardashian to the Kennedy Space Center for the launch of the Artemis mission to the moon.For  decades, scientists and experts have rebutted conspiracy theories claiming the Apollo 11 mission was a hoax.\"Every single argument claiming that Nasa faked the Moon landings has been discredited,\" according to the Institute of Physics.",

    "body": "A Japanese superhero series that inspired the hugely popular Power Rangers TV and movie franchise from the 1990s is ending after 50 years, local media report.Super Sentai will go off air as sales from merchandise and events have not been enough to cover production costs, reports say. Its broadcaster TV Asahi declined to comment on \"future programming\", according to the Asahi newspaper.The series premiered in 1975 and its formula - five teens who transform into colourful masked fighters to battle aliens - served as the blueprint for Power Rangers in the US and many other superhero shows that aired in Asia.It also served as a launchpad for the careers of many Japanese actors.Super Sentai was much more than a TV series. The show that aired weekly was essentially an advertisement for toys, clothes, costumes and collectibles.For animation and toy fans outside Japan, it served as a gateway to the country's colourful superhero and comic book culture.Similar shows like Choudenshi Bioman and Hikari Sentai Maskman were dubbed in English and developed cult followings in the Philippines.In the Super Sentai series, the superhero team, made up of three men and two women, is led by a fighter in a red suit - as in Power Rangers. The rest of team is colour-coded, green or black for the second-in-command, followed by blue, yellow and pink.Every episode also followed the same sequence - starting with martial arts and swordfights and ending with a battle between their robot spaceship and a giant alien in the end. A large part of its appeal is the live-action animation, which in the 1980s and 1990s bordered on crude.The original Power Rangers series aired on US TV from 1993 to 1996 and there have been multiple spin-offs. The episodes are now streamed on YouTube.Producer Haim Saban, who adapted Power Rangers from the Japanese original, said in a 2017 interview with the LA Times that the concept was a tough sell at first.\"Every selling season, I would go out and offer it to the networks - and would get kicked out of the room... They told me how crazy I was,\" he said.News of Super Sentai's demise drew sadness from fans and celebrities.Popular actress Keiko Kitagawa re-posted a news article on the reported cancellation with the caption \"despair\". Her post on X was viewed 15 million times.Yasuhisa Furuhara, an actor who played one of the Super Sentai fighters, noted how the series ran for half a century. \"I'm proud to be a part of history,\" he said on X.One fan on X said his parents had watched Super Sentai when they were children. And that he is watching the current series. \"I'll miss it... What a shame.\"\"Super Sentai is coming to an end, so what should boys watch from now on?\" another fan said.",

    "body": "11 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorPierre Crom/Getty ImagesRob Jetten, 38, is now tipped to become the youngest prime minister in modern Dutch historyCentrist liberal leader Rob Jetten has claimed victory in Wednesday's nail-biting Dutch election, after vote analysis indicated his party could not be beaten by anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders.Jetten's D66 party currently has a narrow lead of 15,000 votes over Wilders' Freedom Party, and Dutch news agency ANP says even though the vote count is not complete, Wilders can no longer win.\"We are the biggest party in the Netherlands! Now we'll get to work for all Dutch people,\" Jetten posted on X. Wilders said it was the electoral council not a news agency that decided the result: \"What arrogance not to wait for that.\"Projections from about 99% of the vote put both parties on 26 seats in the 150-seat parliament - but ANP says Jetten's centrists could win a 27th seat.Jetten, 38, told reporters he was \"very proud of this historic result\" and now felt a great responsibility to form a stable and ambitious government.Wilders had led opinion polls going into Wednesday's election, but Rob Jetten succeeded in winning in some of the main Dutch cities including Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht with a positive campaign using a catchphrase of \"Yes, we can\". No Dutch election race has ever been so close, and if Jetten does become prime minister he will be the youngest in Dutch history.Until now Jetten was careful not to declare victory until all votes were in, but ANP said based on figures from postal voters abroad he could now be declared the winner.Wilders said even if D66 did go on to become the biggest party, his Freedom Party (PVV) would \"not let the Netherlands be broken up by Jetten and his people\".Jetten told reporters that his party had \"shown to the rest of Europe and the world that it is possible to beat the populist movements if you campaign with a positive message\".The Dutch electoral system is based on proportional representation in one nationwide constituency, so whichever party secures most votes wins most seats. Jetten's liberals have so far won 16.9% of the vote, while Wilders' Freedom Party is on 16.7%. As results came in on Thursday, the race was so close that the lead flipped between the two parties.In a sign that he was not ready to concede victory, Wilders dubbed the Dutch news agency \"ANP66\" and shared unfounded claims from social media of vote-rigging. One local authority, in Zaanstad outside Amsterdam, rejected the allegation as \"fabricated\".Although the D66 leader's path to forming a coalition is not straightforward, Jetten has said he wants to make a quick start.Jetten said after the vote that never before had a party won a Dutch election with fewer than 30 seats. He will need the support of at least three other parties to gather the 76 seats needed to form a coalition. The most obvious candidates would be the conservative-liberal VVD, the left-wing Labour (PvdA)-GreenLeft alliance and the Christian Democrats, but it could take months if that is to happen.VVD leader Dilan Yesilgöz has so far ruled out working with the left, but Jetten said he favoured a broad-based government from the centre of Dutch politics.The weekend would be a good chance for all the parties to reflect, before a \"scout\" is given the task next Tuesday of sounding them out. Jetten said he wanted to construct a coalition that represented best the millions of voters who had backed other parties to tackle the main issues, including the housing shortage and asylum and migration.His path to victory has stunned observers. Less than two years ago he led D66 - a party formed by democratic reformers in 1966 - to fifth place and just nine seats. Only a few weeks ago they were still languishing in the opinion polls, but gradually improved as Jetten put in several polished performances in TV debates and even  competed in the final of a TV quiz show 11 days before the election.Outgoing Prime Minister Dick Schoof predicted on Friday that Jetten's task of forming a coalition would prove complicated. \"I reckon I'll still be prime minister at Christmas - I'd be surprised if it happened [by then]\".Schoof, a former chief of Dutch intelligence, was picked for the top job by Geert Wilders, who abandoned his bid to lead the country last year because his prospective coalition partners would not support having a far-right prime minister.Wilders won the last election in November 2023, and a government was only formed in July 2024. Eleven months later, he brought his own government down, in a row with his coalition partners over asylum and migration policy.",

    "body": "11 hours agoMayeni Jones,Africa correspondent, Bernd Debusmann Jr,at the White House and Natasha BootyThe South African government has criticised the US's decision to prioritise refugee applications from white Afrikaners, saying claims of a white genocide have been widely discredited and lack reliable evidence.It highlighted an open letter published by prominent members of the Afrikaner community earlier this week rejecting the narrative, with some signatories calling the relocation scheme racist.The limited number of white South African Afrikaners signing up to relocate to the US was indication that they were not being persecuted, it added.On Thursday, the administration of US President Donald Trump announced its lowest refugee annual cap on record - to just 7,500.The exact figures of the number of white South Africans who have been admitted through the US scheme are not available. South Africa's latest crime statistics do not indicate that more white people have fallen victim to violent crime than other racial groups. Earlier this year President Trump offered refugee status to Afrikaners - who are mostly descendants of Dutch and French settlers - after South African President Cyril Ramaphosa signed a law allowing the government to seize land without compensation in rare instances. Is there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?Unpacking the South African land law that so inflames TrumpOn the road incorrectly identified as a 'burial site' by TrumpMost private farmland is owned by white South Africans who make up just over 7% of the population.Several months ago, South Africa's ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool, was expelled after accusing Trump of \"mobilising a supremacism\" and trying to \"project white victimhood as a dog whistle\".In the Oval Office in May, Trump confronted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa and claimed white farmers in his nation were being killed and \"persecuted\".President Trump held up a photo purporting to show body bags containing the remains of white people in South Africa, but the Reuters news agency later identified the photo as one of their own - taken thousands of miles away in the war-struck Democratic Republic of Congo.Washington did not comment on the claim that they had misidentified the image.The White House also played a video which they said showed burial sites for murdered white farmers. It later emerged that the videos were scenes from a 2020 protest in which the crosses represented farmers killed over multiple years.",

    "body": "10 hours agoAnbarasan Ethirajan,Global affairs reporter and Natasha BootyMore than 60,000 people have fled the Sudanese city of el-Fasher, which was captured by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) over the weekend, according the UN refugee agency. There have been reports of mass executions and crimes against humanity as the RSF fighters stormed the city after an 18-month siege marked by starvation and heavy bombardment.The flow of those fleeing the violence towards the town of Tawila, about 80km (50 miles) west of el-Fasher, had increased in the past few days, the UNHCR's Eujin Byun told the BBC.They were narrating horrendous stories of atrocities, including rape, and the agency was struggling to find enough shelter and food for them, she said.But the RSF has detained one of its militiamen, Abu Lulu, who has been accused of summary executions.The group shared footage showing the fighter's arrest after BBC Verify identified him as being responsible for the execution of multiple unarmed men near el-Fasher.TikTok has confirmed to the BBC that it has banned the account associated with Lulu. It is not clear whether he had controlled the account in his name.Sudan was plunged into a civil war in April 2023 after a vicious struggle for power broke out between its army and the RSF.It has led to a famine and claims of a genocide in the western Darfur region.More than 150,000 people have died in the conflict across the country, and about 12 million have fled their homes in what the UN has called the world's largest humanitarian crisis.The takeover of el-Fasher reinforces the geographic split in the country, with the RSF now in control of western Sudan and much of neighbouring Kordofan to the south, and the army holding the capital, Khartoum, central and eastern regions along the Red Sea.The two warring rivals had been allies - coming to power together in a coup in 2021 - but fell out over an internationally backed plan to move towards civilian rule.Additional reporting by Merlyn Thomas",

    "body": "20 hours agoPumza Fihlani,BBC Africa, Johannesburg and Wycliffe MuiaA South African court has ruled that Nobel laureate Albert Luthuli's 1967 death was the result of an \"assault\" by apartheid police, overturning decades of claims that it was an accident.An inquest held under the apartheid government concluded that Luthuli, the first African to win the Nobel Peace Prize, died after being struck by a freight train while walking along a railway line.But activists and his family had long cast doubt on the findings, and South Africa's government reopened the case this year. A judge on Thursday ruled that the anti-apartheid hero died as a result of a fractured skull and a cerebral haemorrhage associated with an assault. His family has welcomed the judgement.Luthuli, who at the time of his death was the leader of the then-banned African National Congress (ANC), won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1960 for spearheading the fight against apartheid.Ghosts of apartheid haunt South Africa as compensation anger brewsSouth Africa's long wait for justice over apartheid crimesThe ANC went on to lead the struggle against white-minority rule and came to power in 1994, following the first democratic elections.South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority in April reopened fresh investigations into Luthuli's death as family and activists suspected the apartheid authorities had killed him and covered it up. Delivering the judgment on Thursday, Judge Nompumelelo Radebe said evidence presented at the reopened inquest did not support the 1967 inquest findings. \"It is found that the deceased died as a result of a fractured skull, cerebral haemorrhage and concussion of the brain associated with an assault,\" Judge Nompumelelo ruled.The judge said Luthuli's death was attributable to \"assault by members of the security special branch of the South African police, acting in concert and in common purpose with employees of the South African Railway Company\".She named seven men, whose whereabouts could \"not be ascertained\", as having committed or being complicit in the murder. If found, they could face criminal charges. After the judgment was read out, the Luthuli family's spokesperson called it \"the first part of finally getting justice\".ANC national spokesperson Mahlengi Bhengu also welcomed the court's decision, which she said \"corrected a long-standing distortion of history\".\"This ruling brings justice, truth and dignity to the memory of one of South Africa's greatest sons and to all those who suffered under apartheid brutality,\" Bhengu added. The case at the Pietermaritzburg High Court is the latest in renewed efforts by South African authorities to deliver justice for victims of apartheid-era crimes and closure for their families.Last month, South Africa prosecutors reopened the inquest into the death of anti-apartheid leader Steve Biko, who died in police custody in 1977 after being tortured.In May, President Cyril Ramaphosa established a judicial commission of inquiry to look into allegations of improper influence in delaying or hindering the investigation and prosecution of apartheid-era crimes.",

    "body": "17 hours agoSuranjana Tewari,Asia Business Correspondent in Gyeongju and Osmond Chia,Business reporterUS chip giant Nvidia will supply more than 260,000 of its most advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips to South Korea's government, as well as Samsung, LG, and Hyundai.The companies will all deploy the AI chips in factories to make everything from semiconductors and robots to autonomous vehicles and meant that South Korea can \"now produce intelligence as a new export,\" chief executive Jensen Huang said.Mr Huang did not disclose the value of the South Korean deals.It caps off a busy week for Nvidia, which on Wednesday became the first company to be valued at $5 trillion and on Thursday saw signs of a thaw in US-China trade relations that may mean it can export more of its chips to China .Speaking at a CEO summit on the sidelines of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) in Gyeongju, South Korea, Mr Huang added that with the chips, companies would be able to create \"digital twins\" with other factories around the world.These deals form part of Nvidia's latest effort to expand AI infrastructure globally, to further integrate AI into products and services.Nvidia has been striking international partnerships which helped it become the first company ever to be valued at $5tn (£3.8tn) on Wednesday.The South Korea deals come as Nvidia grapples with the fallout of the China-US trade war.China made up more than a tenth of Nvidia's revenue last year, but the extent of China's access to Nvidia's chips has been a point of friction with Washington.\"We used to have 95% share of the AI business in China. Now we're at 0% share. And I'm disappointed by that,\" Huang said in Gyeongju on Friday.Trump said after his meeting with Xi on Thursday that Beijing will hold talks with Nvidia to discuss sales of its chips in China.Trump said the talks remained between China and the US company, but that the US government will play the role of a \"referee\" of sorts.On Friday, Huang said he would like to sell Nvidia's state-of-the-art Blackwell chips to China, although the decision needed to be made by the US President.The US imposes export controls on sales to China of Nvidia's most-advanced AI chips.The tech boss had no news on China sales, or the talks between the two leaders but that he hopes they'll find a way to have new policies that allow chips back into China. \"It's in the best interest of America to have the China market and it's in China's interest to have an American company bring technology to the country,\" Huang said.\"We'd like to see American technology be the global standard.\"South Korea - which is already home to major semiconductor companies and vehicle manufacturers - wants to become a regional AI hub.The country is the ideal place to expand AI infrastructure, according to the Nvidia CEO, because of its access to energy and land, and its ability to construct factories. President Lee Jae Myung said he would prioritise AI investment after coming into office in the face of US tariffs.With the Nvidia deal, the South Korean government plans to build computing infrastructure that it will control, a term known as \"sovereign AI\". More than 50,000 Nvidia chips will power data centres at the National AI Computing Center and facilities owned by South Korean companies like Kakao and Naver.The chip giant is dependent on the tightly-knit supply chains that run through the Asia Pacific region.Nvidia is primarily a chip designer, and so outsources most of its physical production to manufacturers like Samsung, SK Hynix and TSMC.TSMC has been a critical partner for Nvidia, making the company's most advanced AI chips, including its flagship Blackwell series.Samsung makes parts for Nvidia's H20 chips, a scaled-down processor made for the Chinese market under US export rules.National security experts and some politicians have long voiced concerns about the US selling AI chips to China, saying that Beijing could use them to gain an advantage in AI, as well as in military applications.Analysts say that US efforts to block China's access to advanced computer chips have fostered innovation within China.Both Huawei and Alibaba have unveiled their own chips that they say can rival Nvidia's products for the Chinese market.Beijing has also reportedly prohibited local firms from buying from Nvidia, urging them to buy from Chinese chipmakers to give its domestic tech industry a boost.\"We respect deeply the capabilities of China,\" Nvidia's Jensen Huang said on Friday.Nvidia's share price was this week further boosted by a wave of new deals, including partnerships with the US Department of Energy, Nokia, Uber, and Stellantis - moves aimed at reassuring investors that AI investments will deliver returns.Hopes of a revival in China sales, following trade talks between Presidents Trump and Xi, also lifted its share price.Additional reporting by Jaltson Akkanath Chummar",

    "body": "3 hours agoCherylann MollanBBC News, MumbaiGetty ImagesIndia's passport ranks 85th out of 199 countries on the Henley Passport IndexEarlier this year, a video by an Indian travel influencer complaining about India's weak passport went viral on social media.He said that while neighbouring countries like Bhutan and Sri Lanka were more welcoming of Indian tourists, getting visas to travel to most Western and European countries remained a challenge.His dissatisfaction with India's poor passport strength was reflected in the latest Henley Passport Index - a ranking system of the world's passports based on visa-free travel - which placed India in the 85th spot out of 199 countries, five spots lower than last year.The Indian government has not commented on the report yet. The BBC has reached out to the ministry of external affairs.Countries like Rwanda, Ghana and Azerbaijan with much smaller economies than India - which is the fifth-largest economy globally - are ranked higher on the index at the 78th, 74th and 72nd spots, respectively.In fact, India's rank in the past decade has hovered in the 80s, even dipping to the 90th spot in 2021. These rankings are dismal compared to Asian nations like Japan, South Korea and Singapore, which have consistently held top positions.This year, like the last, Singapore topped the index with visa-free travel to 193 countries. South Korea came in second with 190 visa-free destinations and Japan ranked third with 189 countries.Meanwhile, Indian passport holders have visa-free entry to 57 countries, just like the citizens of the African country Mauritania, which shares the 85th rank with India. Getty ImagesIndian passport holders have visa-free entry to 57 countriesPassport strength reflects a nation's soft power and global influence. It also translates into better mobility for its citizens, boosting business and learning opportunities. A weak passport means more paperwork, higher visa costs, fewer travel privileges and longer waiting times for travel.But despite the decline in the rank, the number of countries offering visa-free access to Indians has actually increased in the past decade or so.For example, in 2014 - the year Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power - 52 countries offered visa-free travel to Indians and its passport ranked 76th on the index.A year later, it tumbled to the 85th position, then rose to 80th in 2023 and 2024, dropping again to the 85th position this year. Meanwhile, visa-free destinations for Indians increased from 52 in 2015 to 60 in 2023 and 62 in 2024. The number of visa-free destinations in 2025 (57) is higher than what it was in 2015 (52), yet India's rank for both these years is 85. So, why is that?Experts say that a major reason is the increasingly competitive landscape in global mobility - meaning countries are entering into more travel partnerships to benefit their citizens and their economies. According to a 2025 report by Henley & Partners, the global average number of destinations travellers are able to access visa-free has nearly doubled from 58 in 2006 to 109 in 2025.For example, China has increased the number of visa-free destinations its citizens can travel to from 50 to 82 in the past decade. Consequently, its rank on the index has improved from 94th to 60th during the same time period.Meanwhile, India - which was ranked 77th on the index in July (the Henley Passport Index is updated quarterly to reflect changes in global visa policies) as it enjoyed visa-free access to 59 countries - dropped to the 85th position in October after losing access to two countries.Getty ImagesSingapore's passport is the most powerful in the worldAchal Malhotra, former Indian ambassador to Armenia, says there are other factors that affect the strength of a country's passport, like its economic and political stability as well as its openness to welcoming citizens from other countries.For example, the US passport has dropped out of the top 10 and now occupies the 12th position - a historic low - because of its increasingly insular stance in world politics, the report says. Mr Malhotra recalls how in the 1970s, Indians enjoyed visa-free travel to many Western and European countries, but that changed after the Khalistan movement in the 1980s, which called for an independent homeland for Sikhs in India and caused internal turmoil. Subsequent political upheavals have further chipped away at India's image as a stable, democratic country.\"Many countries are also becoming increasingly wary of immigrants,\" Mr Malhotra says. \"India has a high number of people migrating to other countries or overstaying their visas and that interferes with the country's reputation.\"Factors such as how secure a country's passport is and its immigration procedures also play a role in gaining visa-free access to other countries, Mr Malhotra says.India's passport remains vulnerable to security threats. In 2024, the Delhi police arrested 203 people for alleged visa and passport fraud. India is also known for having cumbersome immigration procedures and a slow pace of visa processing.Mr Malhotra says that technological advances, like India's recently-launched electronic passport or e-passport, can improve security and ease the immigration process. The e-passport includes a small chip that stores biometric information, making it harder to forge or tamper with the document.But more diplomatic outreach and travel agreements remain key to boosting the global mobility of Indians and, by extension, India's passport ranking.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "4 hours agoAndrew HardingParis correspondent, ParisThis week's trial of three undercover operatives, accused of helping the Kremlin to wage a hybrid warfare campaign to \"destabilise\" France, sounds like a surefire recipe for drama, sophistication, and intrigue.If only.Over the course of three days, in a spacious, pine-panelled courtroom on the northern edge of Paris, the case against three seemingly unremarkable Bulgarian men, seated behind glass and shadowed by three police officers who seemed absorbed with their own mobile phones, unfolded with all the panache and excitement of a half-whispered lecture in a library.\"I had absolutely no idea where we were.\"\"I did it for the money.\"\"In the future I plan to get involved in charity work.\"These few lines from the men's testimony may help convey the general tone.All three were jailed on Friday for two to four years.But to bemoan the barely audible banality of it all – the dull motives, the mumbled attempts to shift blame, the sullen complaints about prison life and unsatisfactory psychiatric evaluations - is to miss the truth.The banality is the whole point.Like the cheap drones that both Russia and Ukraine now use to patrol their front lines, the three men on trial in courtroom 2.01 at the Palais de Justice in Paris represent a low-budget evolution of modern hybrid warfare.Improvised and startlingly effective.Rising in turn inside their glass cage, Georgi Filipov, Nikolay Ivanov and Kiril Milushev admitted carrying out the acts, but denied working for a foreign power as well as antisemitism.Early one morning in May 2024, on the banks of the River Seine in the heart of Paris, the three men conspired to spray red paint - and filmed themselves doing so - on the Wall of the Righteous, a monument to those who saved French Jews from the Holocaust during World War Two. Thirty-five red handprints were left on the Shoah memorial. Five hundred more were painted elsewhere.It was the first in a series of symbolic attacks in France: pigs' heads placed outside mosques (an act blamed on a group of Serbians); coffins left ominously by the Eiffel Tower; Stars of David painted around the capital.News of each event was swiftly broadcast around the world – not just by regular media outlets, but by the automated army of Russian social media trolls which, according to the French agency monitoring such activity, routinely seeks to weaponise each sliver of news that might raise doubts about the stability of French society, and the strength of Europe's democracies, its institutions, and its values.France is seen as a particularly tempting target for the Kremlin, given its current political and social divisions, its often ambiguous attitude to Nato, its large Muslim and Jewish populations, the increasing popularity of the far right, and a history of close ties to Moscow on both extremes of the political spectrum.In another era, the Kremlin might have used its own deep undercover agents to carry out acts of sabotage or vandalism. But – to make the drone warfare comparison again – why rely solely on valuable assets like highly trained spies, giant ballistic missiles, or submarines used to cut undersea cables, when for a few thousand euros you can, through discreet and easily deniable channels, recruit your own disaffected army of petty criminals, or unemployed wannabe fascists?\"I had absolutely no idea where we were,\" said Georgi Filipov, as he tried to play down his alleged role in the \"red hands\" operation, arguing that he had travelled from Bulgaria simply to make a little money to help with child support payments for his nine-year-old son. He was allegedly paid €1,000 (£875) plus travel expenses.In the dock, Filipov, 36, cut a gaunt but muscular figure, twitching slightly like a boxer before a fight as he attempted to defuse awkward questions about his tattoos. In particular, the swastika on his chest and the social media photos showing him giving a Nazi salute and wearing a t-shirt that claimed Hitler \"was right\".\"I made bad choices in the past,\" Filipov explained, and pointed out that he had already removed several tattoos. The Paris criminal court sentenced him to two years in jail.Having been successfully extradited from Bulgaria and Croatia to face trial in France, the men all sought to place the blame on a fourth man, Mircho Angelov, who remains at large but is alleged to have links to a Russian intelligence officer. He was given a three-year term in absentia.The second defendant, Kiril Milushev, 28, said he had only come to France because he had broken up with his partner, was struggling with a bipolar disorder, and wanted to keep his friend, Mircho, company. He was given two years.Seated beside Milushev, Nikolay Ivanov creased his forehead as he denied any links with Russia. He spoke of his grandparents' role in saving Jews during World War Two and said his ambition now was to obtain a master's degree in law, and to be reunited with his girlfriend - if she'd still have him, when all this was over.Considered the mastermind behind the plot, he was given the heaviest jail term of four years.As for Russia's alleged role in the red-hands affair, even the defence lawyers openly admitted that \"we suspect\" Moscow's hand. But they insisted, as did their clients, that they were unwitting pawns, proxies – one might even say \"drones\" – in a shadow war against the West.",

    "body": "5 hours agoWycliffe Muia and Lucy FlemingReutersPresident Samia Suluhu Hassan took office in 2021 after the death of her predecessor and this is her first presidential electionHundreds of people have been killed in Tanzania during three days of protests following Wednesday's general election, the country's main opposition party has said.The death toll varies, and a nationwide internet shutdown is making it difficult to verify the numbers. While a spokesperson from the opposition Chadema party told AFP news agency that \"around 700\" people had been killed in clashes with security forces, a diplomatic source in Tanzania told the BBC there was credible evidence that at least 500 people had died.The government has sought to play down the scale of the violence - and authorities have extended a curfew in a bid to quell the unrest.The demonstrations have seen mostly young protesters take to the streets in cities across Tanzania to denounce the election as unfair.They accuse the government of undermining democracy by suppressing the main opposition leaders - one is in jail and another was excluded on technical grounds - thus bolstering President Samia Suluhu Hassan's chances of winning with her ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party.Tanzania's first female president faces little oppositionWhy elections are a time of fear for albino TanzaniansHow Samia's hesitant reforms are fuelling Tanzanian political angerProtests continued on Friday, as demonstrators in the port city of Dar es Salaam defied warnings from the army chief to end the unrest.Foreign Minister Mahmoud Kombo Thabit has described the violence as a \"few isolated pockets of incidents here and there\" and said \"security forces acted very swiftly and decisively to address the situation\".\"We are [also] continuing to receive reports of vandalised properties,\" the minister told BBC Focus on Africa, adding that the internet blackout was necessary to stop such vandalism and save lives.ReutersPolling day was marred by clashes, especially in the port city of Dar es SalaamIt has been difficult for journalists and human rights groups to check the reports of deaths, and hospitals have been refusing to give out information when asked about casualties.A source at one hospital in Dar es Salaam told the BBC it had been overwhelmed with casualties since Thursday, and that most public hospitals in the city were in the same position, reportedly with full morgues.One Chadema politician said that he fears for his life as \"massacres are carried out during night hours when no-one is there to witness them\".\"[The security forces] are tracking down all our leaders and some have had to leave the country. These people kill with impunity,\" John Kitoka, Chadema's director of foreign and diaspora affairs, told the BBC's Newshour programme.\"We remain concerned that the run-up to the elections was marked by harassment, abductions and intimidation of opposition figures, journalists and civil society actors,\" he added.The UN has called on Tanzania's security forces to refrain from using unnecessary force, and foreign ministers from the UK, Canada and Norway issued a joint statement urging authorities \"to act with maximum restraint\" and respect \"freedom of expression\".ReutersMany of the protesters chose not to vote because the main opposition candidates were not on the ballotIn Tanzania's semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar - which elects its own government and leader - CCM's Hussein Mwinyi, who is the incumbent president, won with nearly 80% of the vote.The opposition in Zanzibar said there had been \"massive fraud\", the AP news agency reported.Tourists on the island are reportedly stranded at the airport, with protests on the mainland and the internet shutdown delaying flights.ReutersTear gas was fired to disperse demonstrators - this protest was in the town of Namanga, which is on the border with KenyaOfficial results are expected on Saturday, but President Samia is expected to win under the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party, which has governed the country since independence in 1961.She came to power in 2021 as Tanzania's first female president following the death in office of former President John Magufuli.Samia was initially praised for easing political repression, but the political space has since narrowed, with her government accused of targeting critics through arrests and a wave of abductions.There were two main opposition contenders - Tundu Lissu, who is being held on treason charges, which he denies, and Luhaga Mpina of the ACT-Wazalendo party - but he was excluded on legal technicalities.Sixteen fringe parties, none of whom have historically had significant public support, were allowed to run.Additional reporting by Stewart Maclean and Basillioh RukangaMore about Tanzania from the BBC:'A bullet went through my skull': Tanzania abduction survivorTop opposition politician arrested days before Tanzania election'I want my son back, dead or alive' - mother of missing Tanzanian ex-diplomatGetty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "1 day agoNatalie ShermanBBC NewsGetty ImagesScott Bessent is the face of America's gamble on ArgentinaUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been the point-person entrusted with selling financial markets on some of President Donald Trump's riskiest economic gambles: sweeping global tariffs, trade talks with China and preparations to install a new leader at the US central bank.But Bessent's trickiest task may just be the White House bet on Argentina. The US stepped onto the scene in mid-September, responding to a plunge in the peso - the Argentine currency - which officials feared could imperil Trump ally President Javier Milei and his party in looming midterm elections. Bessent said the US would do whatever was needed to stabilise the situation, calling the country a key ally in the region. In political terms, the US intervention - which included purchases of pesos and the establishment of a $20bn (£15bn) currency swap line that gives the Argentine central bank access to dollars - was a success for Milei. His party not only fended off losses in the midterm elections but made inroads, strengthening his position.Argentina's Milei wins big in midterms with 'chainsaw' austerityBut whether the US intervention in the country will be a success financially is another question.The peso has fallen roughly 30% this year, including roughly 4% over the last month. The drop came despite the US commitments - and a modest rally after the election. It's an indication of the ongoing risk. At the end of the day, the US could find itself holding a pile of pesos worth much less than they were originally. The intervention in Argentina was a highly unusual move - especially from a White House known for its \"America First\" approach. Milei has endeared himself to conservatives in the US with his embrace of free-market reforms and radical spending cuts. He has met frequently with Trump, who has called him his \"favourite president\". But the US has rarely offered financial bailouts to other countries - especially in a case that posed no wider financial stability risks - and direct purchases of a struggling emerging market currency are unprecedented, says Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.Adding to the risk is Argentina's long history of currency devaluation and debt default, including most recently in 2020.Getty ImagesMilei's party took 13 of 24 upper-house seats and 64 of the 127 lower-house seats that were contested in a recent electionFew are positioned to be as aware of the potential pitfalls as Bessent, who made his name as a currency trader working for George Soros. Bessent famously took part in the 1992 speculation against the British pound. At that time, investors who bet that Sterling had been overvalued were said to have broken the Bank of England with their heavy selling.This time, Bessent finds himself on the opposite side of similar gamble. He has defended his moves, invoking the spectre of fellow South American country, Venezuela, and arguing that failure to shore up Argentina as a US ally could lead to destabilisation in the region.\"These results are a clear example that the Trump Administration policy of Peace through Economic Strength is working,\" Bessent wrote on social media after the recent election in Argentina.How Milei's economics divided his nation - but won over TrumpOn Wednesday, Bessent posted again to say: \"the Argentine economic bridge has now turned a profit for the American people\". The US Treasury Department did not respond to inquiries seeking more details. But it has kept quiet about key information needed to assess Bessent's claims - including the timeline and scale of its peso purchases - or sales - and what, if any, other assets the Argentine government pledged in order to secure the swap deal. Analysts have estimated the US has purchased as much as $2bn worth of pesos so far - hardly an earth-shattering figure. But Democrats have criticised the help at a time of White House spending cuts and an ongoing government shutdown, accusing Bessent of wanting to protect finance \"buddies\" with investments in the country. Even some members of Trump's own Republican Party have questioned how the aid aligns with the president's \"America First\" goals.Getty ImagesTrump has pushed back against criticism of his financial support for Milei, saying Argentina is \"fighting for its life\"Bessent has disputed any characterisation of the US support for Argentina as a \"bailout\", promising there will be \"no taxpayer losses\" and even declaring the peso \"undervalued\".But while that could be true for a short-term trade, that view is not the general consensus.To the contrary - most analysts say the peso is overvalued, but has been propped up by support from the Argentine central bank, which set trading limits for the peso in April. Economists say maintaining such limits is not sustainable. They cite the surge in Argentines travelling to make purchases in neighbouring countries where their money travels farther as one of the signs that the peso is being held artificially high.The Argentine central bank has insisted it is committed to the trading band, which was intended to protect the country from wild currency swings destabilising prices and support Milei's efforts to control inflation.But it has already had to spend billions buying pesos to keep the currency steady, burning through International Monetary Fund (IMF) funding and dipping into its foreign reserves, which are key to paying its debt obligations. Economists say they expect the bank will have to change its policy to allow the peso to fall more - or the country risks needing another bailout.That choice presents a dilemma for Bessent, given his promises to guard the US against losses.\"Is the US willing to provide support to Argentina so that Argentina can defend the peso at this level?\" Mr Setser asks. \"Bessent has to decide in a sense whether to double down... or he has to let the peso adjust and recognise that his intervention was a bridge to the election.\"EPA/ShutterstockThe peso plummeted ahead of the midterms, as businesses and households in Argentina rushed to trade the currency for dollars.People wanted to protect themselves, remembering the way the currency collapsed in 2019 after the election loss of former president Mauricio Macri, who was also known for economic reform, says Joaquín Bagües, managing director of Buenos Aires-based Grit Capital Group. \"Every single guy that I talked to, they wanted to buy dollars... they have very fresh memories about that,\" he said, describing the run as a \"confidence crisis.\"Mr Bagües says the demand for dollars has eased since the election.But the peso has not experienced the kind of sustained relief seen in other assets, like bonds or the stock market, which surged more than 20% the day after the election and has continued to rise.While Argentine companies are starting to tap international lending markets again, after being frozen out ahead of the election, analysts say they expect US banks to remain wary of lending to Argentina, despite a push by Bessent to arrange an additional $20bn in private financing.And Mr Bagües says there are too many policy questions ahead to predict what will happen to the peso.Kathryn Exum, co-head of sovereign research at Gramercy Funds Management, suggests that the peso could rise \"over the medium term\" if the government is able to continue advancing economic reforms.But, she adds, \"there's a lot that needs to be done between now and then\".For now, Anthony Simond, investment director on the emerging market debt team at Aberdeen Group, says he expects the peso has farther to fall. \"Bessent may say one thing, but I think the economic reality may force them to be a little bit more flexible in terms of currency management,\" he says.",

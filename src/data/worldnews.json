    "body": "2 hours agoHugh Schofield,Paris and Rachel HaganGetty ImagesSecond-hand clothing platform Vinted is under investigation in France after some user accounts were found to be directing visitors to pornographic content.France's Children's Rights Commissioner Sarah El-Haïry said she had asked watchdog Arcom to examine the allegations first reported in French media.Vinted, which has 23 million users in France, has no age-verification procedure - meaning children and teenagers could have been exposed to pornographic material without having to show proof they were over 18.In a statement, the Lithuania-based company said it had a \"zero-tolerance policy regarding unsolicited communications of a sexual nature or the promotion of sexual services\".\"All inappropriate and illegal content is removed, and where necessary we take measures against users, including blocking them definitively from our site,\" it was cited as saying by the AFP news agency.Vinted is taking the situation \"very seriously\", it added. Reports first surfaced after some sellers showing photographs of swimwear or lingerie were found to be luring viewers to their personal pages on adult platforms such as OnlyFans. \"Predators have been using the sale of ordinary items of clothing to direct people to porn sites,\" El-Haïry said.France has recently issued warnings to other global e-commerce platforms, including Shein - headquartered in Singapore - after products including childlike sex dolls appeared in their marketing listings. French officials say the case against Shein forms part of a wider investigation into other major e-commerce platforms accused of allowing illicit products to be sold online.Paris prosecutors are examining whether Shein, AliExpress, Temu and Wish breached laws relating to violent, pornographic or \"undignified\" content accessible to minors.Shein and AliExpress are also being investigated specifically over the alleged dissemination of child-related pornographic material. The cases have been referred to the Paris Office des Mineurs, which handles offences involving the protection of children.Shein has already banned the sale of all sex dolls on its platform worldwide and says it is permanently blocking seller accounts linked to the items. The French consumer watchdog, the Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control, said descriptions of the dolls left \"little doubt as to their child-pornography nature\".",

    "body": "10 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondentChile's presidential election will go to a run-off vote in December between a Communist Party and a far-right candidate, after a first round on Sunday produced no outright winner.The election campaign was dominated by crime and immigration, as the flow of people into the country has recently grown, while candidates pledged to fight foreign gangs like Venezuela's Tren de Aragua.The Communist Party's Jeannette Jara, from the governing coalition, narrowly won the first round, followed closely by far-right rival José Antonio Kast.The result is expected to give a boost to Kast, as Jara was the only left-wing candidate running against several right-wing candidates, splitting the right-wing vote.In the 14 December run-off, voters will have to coalesce around one of these two candidates.Kast is expected to pick up votes from other candidates who did not make the final two, including the centre-right Senator Evelyn Matthei and the radical libertarian Congressman Johannes Kaiser. If he wins, it would make Chile the latest country in Latin America to shift to the right.Kast is a conservative lawyer and former congressman who lost the 2021 election's run-off to President Gabriel Boric. This is his third time running for president.The father of nine has promoted a tough crackdown on immigration, including a Trump-style \"border wall\". He opposes abortion even in cases of rape, has criticised environmental and indigenous activism, and wants to shrink the state. His brother was a minister during Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship and his father was a member of the Nazi party.Kast said on election night that Chile needed to avoid \"continuity of a very bad government - perhaps the worst government in the democratic history of Chile\".Jara is a member of the Communist Party, but many see her as centre-left in practice. She was a minister in Boric's government and her platform has included pledging to increase production of lithium - a metal vital for electronics - as well as raising the minimum wage, building new prisons and deploying the army to protect Chile's borders.As results were coming through, she said: \"Democracy in our country must be taken care of and valued. And it costs us a lot to recover it, today it is at risk.\"Both candidates have talked up their pledges on crime and immigration, as organised crime and kidnappings having risen in the country.Chile's foreign population has grown since 2017. The National Migration Service said in December 2023 that the number of foreigners in the country had reached more than 1.9 million people, up more than 46% from 2018. Official estimates suggest at least 330,000 are undocumented migrants living illegally in the country, many from Venezuela.Kast has blamed rising crime on immigration, though several studies suggest that those born abroad commit fewer crimes on average than Chileans.Chile, perceived as more prosperous and safe compared to some other Latin American nations, is a desirable destination for migrants in the region, and for those returning from the US after President Donald Trump's migration crackdown.Kast has pledged to build ditches along Chile's northern border with Peru and Bolivia, as well as mass deportations of undocumented migrants and people who entered the country illegally. He has also promised new maximum-security prisons, like those built in El Salvador.Jara has promised to build new prisons and expel foreigners convicted of drug trafficking.This election was the first time that all eligible voters were automatically registered to vote and that voting was compulsory in Chile.",

    "body": "A court in Singapore has sentenced an Australian man to nine days in prison for grabbing Hollywood star Ariana Grande at a movie premiere.Johnson Wen, 26, was found guilty of being a public nuisance over the high-profile incident last Thursday at the Asia premiere for Wicked: For Good. Videos posted on social media show Wen jumping the barriers, charging at a visibly shocked Grande and grabbing her shoulders while jumping up and down.The incident sparked outrage in Singapore, where many called for the arrest and deportation of Wen, who has a history of disrupting concerts and celebrity events.Several accused him of \"re-traumatising\" Grande. The pop star turned actress has spoken of experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder after a suicide bomb attack at her May 2017 concert in Manchester, killing 22 people and injuring hundreds.In Wen's trial on Monday, the court heard he had attempted to intrude on the movie premiere twice, Singaporean media reports.Moments after he grabbed Grande, her co-star Cynthia Erivo forcibly pried him off and security staff escorted him out.He then made a second attempt to jump the barricades. Security staff stopped him and this time pinned him down.Wen later posted videos of the incident on his social media accounts thanking Grande and stating that he was \"free\".Police in Singapore arrested him the next day and charged him with public nuisance. Wen pleaded guilty.Prosecutors sought a week's jail for Wen, arguing that he was a \"serial intruder\" who publicised his behaviour to gain popularity online.Wen has posted videos of himself disrupting concerts by Katy Perry and The Weeknd, and invading the pitch at various sporting events. Australian media have reported he is banned from some stadiums and has incurred large fines.Wen, who was not represented in the Singapore court, told the judge in mitigation that he would \"not do it again\".Under Singapore's laws against public nuisance, Wen could have been jailed for up to three months, fined up to S$2,000 (£1,167; $1,537), or both.Grande has not commented on the case, while continuing to appear in public at events in Los Angeles over the weekend.But two days after the incident, Erivo appeared to allude to it when she spoke about her relationship with Grande while making the movie, saying: \"We have come through some stuff in our lives, our daily workings... even this last week, let's be honest.\"",

Most of the victims are from Hyderabad, which is in southern Telangana state. The pilgrims were travelling from the Islamic holy city of Mecca to Medina when the accident took place, the Telangana government said in a statement.They had gone to Saudi Arabia for the Umrah pilgrimage, which is a shorter version of Hajj, the biggest Islamic pilgrimage.Mr Sajjanar said that an oil tanker was involved in the accident but did not give more details.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said in a post on X that he was \"deeply saddened\" by the news of the accident and that Indian authorities were in close contact with officials in Saudi Arabia.\"Our Embassy in Riyadh and Consulate in Jeddah are providing all possible assistance,\" he wrote.Control rooms have been set up in Jeddah and Hyderabad to assist the families of the victims.Asaduddin Owaisi, who represents Hyderabad in India's parliament, told news agency ANI that he had requested the federal government for help in bringing the bodies of the victims back to India.Mr Sajjanar said that 54 people had travelled from Hyderabad to Jeddah on 9 November for the pilgrimage. Of these, four people stayed back in Mecca while four went to Medina by car. The remaining 46 people travelled on the bus.As news of the tragedy broke, distraught relatives have been speaking to the media.Mohammed Tehseen, a resident of Hyderabad, told ANI that seven of his relatives were in the bus. Mr Tehseen said that he heard the news after receiving a call from his relative, Shoaib, who survived the accident and is in hospital.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "A South African man who was seen attending a neo-Nazi rally outside an Australian state parliament has had his visa revoked.Matthew Gruter, who has been in Australia since 2022, took part in an anti-Jewish protest outside the New South Wales parliament organised by the National Socialist Network earlier this month.He was seen among around 60 men clad in black, who held up a banner that said \"Abolish the Jewish lobby\", Australian media report.Australia has seen a recent rise in right-wing extremism. Its government made the Nazi salute punishable by a mandatory prison term earlier this year.Australia's Home Affairs Minister, Tony Burke, confirmed the cancellation of Mr Gruter's visa, saying: \"If you are on a visa, you are a guest.\"If you're a citizen, you're a full member of the Australian family. Like with any household, if a guest turns up to show hatred and wreck the household, they can be told it's time to go home.\"Mr Gruter moved to Australia with his wife and works as a civil engineer, according to ABC News. The National Socialist Network, which organised the rally on 8 November, is a well-known neo-Nazi group in Australia. Mr Gruter is a senior member of the group in New South Wales, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.Demonstrators repeatedly chanted \"blood and honour\", a slogan associated with the Hitler Youth, according to ABC News.New South Wales Premier Chris Minns described the rally, which lasted about 20 minutes, as a \"shocking display of hatred and racism and antisemitism\".Sarah Schwartz, executive officer of the Jewish Council of Australia, told ABC News neo-Nazi groups were a threat to multiculturalism in the country and there needed to be a distinction between peaceful protests and \"hateful stunts\".\"They're acts of hate speech, and they should be considered as such,\" she added.",

    "body": "9 hours agoYolande Knell,Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem and Raffi Berg,LondonThe UN Security Council is expected to vote on a draft resolution backing Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza.The text, submitted by the US, would give a mandate for the deployment of an International Stabilization Force (ISF) and to set up transitional governance there.The US says multiple unnamed countries have offered to contribute to the ISF, though it is unclear whether it would be required to ensure Hamas disarms or function as a peacekeeping force.Its formation is a central plank of Trump's 20-point plan which last month brought a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in their two-year war.The draft also raises the possibility of a Palestinian state - something Israel strongly opposes.There have been intense negotiations over the draft text of the resolution, with Washington warning that any vote against it could lead to a return to fighting with Israel.As well as authorising an ISF, which it says would work with Israel and Egypt - Gaza's southern neighbour - the draft also calls for creation of a newly trained Palestinian police in Gaza. Until now, the police there have operated under the authority of Hamas.According to reports on the latest draft, part of the ISF's role would be to work on the \"permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups\" – including Hamas – as well as protecting civilians and humanitarian aid routes.This would require Hamas to hand over its weapons - something it is meant to do under Trump's peace plan. But in a statement published overnight, Hamas called the draft resolution \"dangerous\" and an \"attempt to subject the Gaza Strip to international authority\".It said Palestinian factions rejected any clause relating to the disarmament of Gaza or harming \"the Palestinian people's right to resistance\".The statement also rejected any foreign military presence inside the Gaza Strip, saying it would constitute a violation of Palestinian sovereignty.The draft goes on to endorse the formation of a Board of Peace, expected to be headed by President Trump, to oversee a body of Palestinian technocrats that will temporarily administer Gaza and take charge of its redevelopment.Following pressure from key Arab states, the latest text mentions a possible future Palestinian state, though without calling for one as the goal.Even so, the inclusion of such a reference drew sharp reaction from Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after allies in his governing coalition criticised the draft, including threatening to leave the government if Netanyahu did not push back.\"Regarding a Palestinian state,\" he said on Sunday, \"our opposition to a Palestinian state in any territory west of the Jordan [River], this opposition is existing, valid, and has not changed one bit.\"Trump's peace plan in effect suspended the fighting between Israel and Hamas which had raged since Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in that attack.More than 69,483 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "4 hours agoChris Ewokor,BBC Africa and Mansur Abubakar,AbujaArmed men have killed a teacher and abducted at least 25 students in an attack on a girls' secondary school in north-western Nigeria, police say.The gang invaded the Government Girls Comprehensive Secondary School in Maga, Kebbi State, at around 04:00 local time (0300 GMT) on Monday, they said.The attackers \"engaged police personnel on duty in a gun duel\" before scaling the perimeter fence and seizing the students from their hostel, a statement said.One member of staff was killed while trying to protect the students. A second sustained gunshot wounds and is now receiving treatment.Eyewitnesses described a large group of attackers, known locally as bandits, who arrived firing sporadically to cause panic.Residents told the BBC that the gunmen subsequently marched a number of girls into nearby bushland.The police said they had deployed \"additional police tactical units, alongside military personnel and vigilante groups\" to the area.A coordinated search and rescue operation is underway in surrounding forests and suspected escape routes.Over the past decade, schools in northern Nigeria have become frequent targets for armed groups, who often carry out abductions to seek ransom payments or leverage deals with the government.As well as trying to crack down on the kidnappers, Nigeria has also banned the payment of ransoms in an attempt to make it less lucrative.This is the first major school abduction since March 2024, when more than 200 pupils were seized from a school in Kuriga, Kaduna state.The attack in Kebbi State highlights the persistent security crisis plaguing the region, leaving families in Maga in a state of fearful exhaustion as they wait and hope for their daughters' safe return.",

    "body": "17 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondent Ecuadoreans have voted against allowing the return of foreign military bases in the country, frustrating US hopes of expanding its presence in the eastern Pacific region.The referendum result is a blow to Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa, who had campaigned to change the constitution to reverse a ban that the country's legislature passed in 2008.He had said it would help fight organised crime and reduce the soaring violence the country has seen in recent years, during which it has become one of the world's biggest drug-trafficking hotspots.The US had hoped the referendum would pave the way to opening a military base in Ecuador, 16 years after it was made to close a site on its Pacific coast.While Ecuador does not produce cocaine, its huge ports and proximity to Colombia and Peru - where large quantities of the drug are made - make it a desirable and lucrative location for drug-trafficking gangs.About 70% of the world's cocaine passes through Ecuador, according to Noboa.His presidency has been defined by a tough military crackdown on criminal gangs, including by putting armed soldiers on the streets. Supporters say his approach has helped to fight crime, but critics say his government has resorted to authoritarian tactics. The former US military base on Ecuador's Pacific coast was closed after left-wing President Rafael Correa decided not to renew its lease and pushed for the constitutional ban.US Homeland Secretary Secretary Kristi Noem recently toured military facilities in Ecuador with Noboa.Noboa told the BBC earlier this year that he wanted foreign \"armies\" to join what he has described as a \"war\" against narco-trafficking groups. He has recently held talks over increased regional security and migration co-operation with US officials.The referendum also saw voters reject ending public funding for political parties, shrinking the size of Congress, and establishing a constitutional assembly to re-write Ecuador's constitution.Noboa had argued a fresh constitution would allow for tougher punishments for criminals and stronger measures to secure the borders, but critics argued it would not solve wider social problems like insecurity and poor access to education or healthcare in some areas.Critics also feared the plans to reduce funding for political parties and the size of Congress could lead to a reduction in checks and balances on the government and representation in poorer areas, though the government hoped it would save public funds.Noboa reacted by saying he would \"respect\" the outcome of the vote.On the day of the referendum, the leader of one of Ecuador's biggest drug-trafficking gangs, Los Lobos, was captured in an operation involving Spanish police.Wilmer \"Pipo\" Chavarria had faked his own death and had been hiding in Europe while controlling criminal operations like drug-trafficking, ordering murders and illegal mining in Ecuador, Noboa said.Both Ecuador and the US have designated Los Lobos as a terrorist organisation under domestic law.This referendum came as the US sent its largest military deployment to the Caribbean in decades, including the world's largest warship and bomber planes.It has carried out at least 21 strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels in the eastern Pacific and the Caribbean, killing at least 83 people. It has not provided evidence about who was aboard and some lawyers have said the strikes may breach international law.Speculation is mounting over whether the US will strike land targets in Venezuela.The US alleges that its President Nicolás Maduro is the head of a narco-trafficking organisation, an accusation he strongly denies. Many observers believe the US military build-up in the region is also an attempt to put pressure on Maduro to force him from power.",

    "body": "Jury in high-profile Australian trial visit beach where murder victim found15 hours agoSimon AtkinsonWangetti Beach, Far North QueenslandSuppliedThe body of Toyah Cordingley was found on a remote beach in northern Queensland in 2018Jurors in a high-profile Australian murder trial have been taken to the remote Queensland beach where the victim was found.Toyah Cordingley was \"repeatedly\" stabbed with a sharp object and put in a shallow sandy grave with \"little or no hope of surviving\", the jury has heard.The 24-year-old's body was discovered by her father the following day on Wangetti Beach - a stretch of coastline between the tourist centres of Cairns and Port Douglas.Rajwinder Singh, 41, denies murdering Ms Cordingley on a Sunday afternoon in October 2018 in Far North Queensland.The jury of 10 men and two women, plus three back-up jurors, attended the beach along with the judge and barristers on Monday morning local time, as the second week of the trial got under way.In a nod to the tropical conditions and temperatures above 30C, Justice Lincoln Crowley wore a T-shirt, sport shorts and trainers rather than a wig and robes. Both the lead prosecution and defence barristers opted for polo shirts, shorts and baseball caps.The jurors were led around 1.2km north up the sand to see where Ms Cordingley's body was discovered.Earlier, as they arrived by bus, four red and white cones marked where the victim's car had been parked.The trip was intended to help the jurors become familiar with key locations in the case and no official evidence was given.Last week, the Cairns Supreme Court heard that the day after Ms Cordingley's body was discovered, Mr Singh flew from Australia to India – leaving behind his wife, three children and parents. He was not heard from until he was arrested four years later, the prosecution said.Justice Lincoln Crowley (second from left) with barristers and other court officials at Wangetti BeachIt is alleged that Mr Singh, who was working as a nurse in the town of Innisfail, south of Cairns, had a confrontation with Ms Cordingley, whom prosecutor Nathan Crane described as \"a young woman, blonde and attractive\".The pharmacy worker was found wearing a bikini, with all her other clothes and most of her possessions missing. Those items were taken by the killer to avoid detection, prosecutors allege.Her dog, Indie, which Ms Cordingley had taken to the beach for a walk, was found tied up to a tree hidden in shrubland about 30 metres from the grave.No murder weapon was ever recovered, and no eyewitnesses have been found.But the prosecution says the crown's case – though circumstantial – was made up of evidence that pointed to Mr Singh \"and eliminated others\".This will include evidence that DNA recovered from a stick at the scene was 3.8 billion times more likely to have come from Mr Singh than a random member of the public.The jury has already heard evidence suggesting that Ms Cordingley's phone left the beach after the killing – and that its movements matched those of a blue Alfa Romeo owned by the accused.Mr Singh's sudden departure from Australia also pointed to his guilt, the prosecution has argued.\"As the police were finding Toyah's body, he was organising... a hurriedly arranged one way trip back to India,\" Mr Crane said last week as he opened his case.The defence is yet to present any evidence, but in his opening address, Mr Singh's barrister Greg McGuire described his client as a \"placid\" and \"caring\" man, who was in the \"wrong place at the wrong time\".He also foreshadowed evidence to come later in the trial that, after his arrest, Mr Singh told an undercover officer he had seen two masked men attack Ms Cordingley and then had run away in fear - something he said was his \"biggest mistake\".Mr McGuire has also said he will give evidence about other people \"both known and unknown\" who should come under suspicion.Ms Cordingley's boyfriend at the time, Marco Heidenreich, whom police quickly ruled out as a possible suspect, was among those who gave evidence last week.The court heard he was an immediate police suspect - and that he had faced questions from Ms Cordingley's father about whether he was involved in his girlfriend's disappearance, even before her body was found.Photographs showing Mr Heidenreich on a hike with a friend on the day Ms Cordingley went missing have been shown to the court, with an expert saying he was confident the pictures were genuine and had not been doctored in any way.The trial will return to the more conventional setting of the courthouse on Tuesday.",

    "body": "32 minutes agoJaroslav Lukiv and James Watershouse,Ukraine correspondent in BrusselsUkraine will get up to 100 of France's Rafale F4  fighter jets as well as advanced air defence systems in a major deal to boost Kyiv's ability to protect itself against deadly Russian attacks.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the move as \"historic\", after signing the letter of intent with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron at an air base near Paris.Deliveries of the Rafale F4's are planned to be completed by 2035, while the joint production of interceptor drones is starting this year.Financial details are yet to be worked out, but reports say France plans to attract EU financing and also access frozen Russian assets - a controversial move that has split the 27-member bloc.\"This is a strategic agreement which will last for 10 years starting from the next year,\" Zelensky said at a joint briefing with Macron on Monday.Ukraine would also get \"very strong French radars\", eight air defence systems and other advanced weaponry, he added.Zelensky stressed that using such advanced systems \"means protecting someone's life... this is very important\".Russia has in recent months increased its drone and missile attacks against Ukraine, targeting energy and rail infrastructure and causing massive blackouts across the country. Dozens of civilians have been killed in the strikes, in what Kyiv and its Western allies describe as war crimes. In the latest overnight Russian missile attack, three people were killed and 15 injured, in the north-eastern Ukrainian city of Balakliya, local officials said.Speaking alongside Zelensky, Macron said: \"We're planning Rafales, 100 Rafales - that's huge. That's what's needed for the regeneration of the Ukrainian military\".The French president added that he wanted to help Ukraine prepare for whatever was coming next.These Rafale fighter jets are seen as crucial to protecting Ukraine's skies, because the country is almost powerless in preventing long-range air strikes on its border towns and cities.\"The Russians are using 6000 glide bombs per month,\" Serhiy Kuzhan, a Ukrainian defence analyst, told the BBC. \"It would be important to have a French air to air system, with a 200km range, because Russians have their own system with a range of 230km.\"While this announcement between Kyiv and Paris is sizeable, Justin Bronk from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) points out: \"The difference they'll make will depend on the timeframe and the missiles that come with them\".This is a long-term political agreement, rather than a detailed purchase order, so few are expecting this announcement to dramatically change the dynamics of Russia's grinding invasion.The promises of Western military hardware are only as effective as the training and logistics they come with. Whether it's a German-made Leopard 2 Tank or an American F16 fighter jet, they all require intensive training, sizable support crews and a lot of spare parts.With the Rafales, further complexities arise around the question of who pays. It's thought France will dip into its own budget contributions for Kyiv, as well as look as joint EU borrowing mechanisms to help pay for the deal.But what you hear privately admitted in EU's corridors of power in Brussels, is that the money is slowing running out.The bloc has agreed to help support Ukraine's battered economy for the next two years, but there is less consensus on whether to unlock €140bn ($162bn; £123bn) of frozen Russian assets to help support Ukraine financially and militarily.The proposals are currently illegal under international law, and some members are nervous about the prospect of having to pay Russia back when the war ends.Ukraine's air force is already using France's Mirage warplanes as well as US-made F-16s. Kyiv has also recently provisionally agreed to obtain Sweden's Gripen fighter jets.After France, Zelensky will travel to Spain to seek further military and other support for Ukraine. Over the weekend, he secured a gas deal with Greece. Vital supplies of US liquefied natural gas are now expected to start flowing into Ukraine this winter via a pipeline across the Balkans.Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukraine's territory and Russian troops have been making slow advances along the vast front line - despite reported huge combat casualties.",

    "body": "2 days agoNikita YadavBBC News, DelhiFor millions across northern India, the November air tastes ashy, the sky looks visibly hazy and merely stepping outside feels like a challenge.For many, their morning routine starts with checking how bad the air is. But what they see depends entirely on which monitor they use. Government-backed apps like SAFAR and SAMEER top out at 500 - the upper limit of India's AQI (air quality index) scale, which converts complex data on various pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone, into a single number. But private and international trackers such as IQAir and open-source monitoring platform AQI routinely show far higher numbers, often shooting past 600 and even crossing 1,000 on some days.This contradiction leaves people asking the same question every year: Which numbers should they trust? And why doesn't India officially report air quality beyond 500?India's official air-quality scale shows readings above 200 pose clear breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. Readings above 400 and up to 500 are classified as \"severe\" and affect healthy people while also seriously impacting those with existing diseases. The scale however does not go beyond 500 -  a cap set more than a decade ago when the National Air Quality Index was launched.So why was that threshold introduced?\"It was assumed that the health impact would be the same no matter how much higher it goes because we had already hit the worst,\" says Gufran Beig, founder director of SAFAR. He admits that the 500 cap was originally set to avoid creating panic as crossing that mark signalled an alarming situation requiring immediate mitigation.But this approach effectively flattens the data - anything above 500 is treated the same on official monitors, even if the real concentration is far higher.\"International organisations and portals don't impose such a cap,\" says Mr Beig. \"That's why we see numbers going much higher on global platforms.\"The BBC has reached out to India's pollution control board for a comment.Beyond the artificially imposed threshold, there's also a difference in defining hazardous air.For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines classify PM2.5 levels - particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers - above 15 micrograms per cubic metre in a 24-hour period as hazardous, while in India, the threshold is 60 micrograms.Experts say that globally, there's no universal AQI formula. US, China and the European Union each apply their own pollutant thresholds.\"WHO provides guidelines and every country has built its index based on its own adaptability, weather and local environment,\" says Mr Beig. Comparing India's AQI to WHO or US standards can thus be misleading. Then there is also a difference in the instruments used. The Indian pollution control board uses Beta Attenuation Monitors (BAMs), which physically measure the mass of particles in the air and are calibrated to strict, standardised metrics for every reading.In contrast, portals like IQAir rely on sensor-based monitors, says Abhijeet Pathak, a scientist who formerly worked for India's pollution control board.Sensor-based monitors use laser scattering and electrochemical methods to estimate the number of particles suspended in the air.\"The sensor is a different tool and it is not possible to calibrate them for every run,\"  says Mr Pathak, adding that \"sensor-based air quality monitoring has not yet been approved by the Indian government\".According to him, India's air quality framework hasn't been comprehensively revised since 2009, and he, along with other environmental scientists and activists have called for recalibrating the scale based on the latest technology.\"National Air Quality index will need to be revised if we want to include the sensor-based data,\" says Mr Pathak. Removing the upper cap is also crucial says Mr Beig, \"now that most literature available shows health symptoms keep on worsening as the pollution levels increase\". In the end, India's AQI doesn't stop at 500 because the pollution stops there. It stops at 500 because the system was built with a ceiling.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "Vital supplies of US liquefied natural gas are due to start flowing into war-ravaged Ukraine this winter via a pipeline across the Balkans.The deal was announced after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis in Athens on Sunday. Greece is working to increase the flow of American LNG to its terminals to \"replace Russian gas in the region\", Mitsotakis said recently.The European Commission plans to ban all imports of Russian gas to EU member states by the end of 2027, arguing revenue from such sales funds Russia's war in Ukraine.In Ukraine, which experiences freezing winters, there are fears of an energy crisis as Russia attacks energy facilities.Zelensky is currently in France, where he President Emmanuel Macron signed a letter of intent to buy up to 100 Rafale jets.Fighting continued overnight, with six people reportedly killed in Russian attacks in the Kharkiv, Kherson and Donetsk regions of Ukraine.Russia's military said it had taken control of three more Ukrainian villages - one each in the Kharkiv, Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions.None of the reports could be independently verified.Speaking earlier in Athens, Zelensky was quoted as saying that deliveries of US LNG would begin in January.\"We rebuild each time the Russians destroy but this truly requires time, much effort, equipment and, regarding gas... imports to compensate for the destruction by the Russians of our own production,\" he said.\"Greece is becoming an energy security provider for your homeland,\" Mitsotakis told the Ukrainian president.Zelensky said Kyiv had allocated funds for gas imports from European partners and banks under European Commission guarantees, as well as from Ukrainian banks, to help cover imports through to March at a cost of nearly €2bn (£1.8bn; $2.3bn), according to news agency Reuters.Since 2015, when it stopped buying Russian gas directly, Ukraine has been receiving supplies from various EU states.The Soviet-era Trans-Balkan pipeline links Ukraine to LNG terminals in Greece via Moldova, Romania and Bulgaria.The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs has issued a formal warning, saying \"the approaching winter poses new risks for Ukrainians... as intensified attacks on energy networks undermine efforts to maintain warmth in homes, schools and health centres\".The letter signed by Zelensky and Macron while visiting the Villacoublay air base near Paris sets out possible future contracts for Ukraine to acquire Rafale fighter jets \"with their associated weapons\".The letter, which is not a purchase and sales contract, also sets out deals for SAMP-T air defence systems, radar systems and drones.On an visit to Sweden last month, Zelensky signed a letter of intent to buy between 100 and 150 Gripen fighter jets.In France, Zelensky also went to Mont Valerien, to the west of Paris, to visit the nascent headquarters of a planned multinational force.The force, which was proposed by the UK and France, may one day help oversee a Ukraine-Russia ceasefire.Tens of thousands of people, most of them soldiers, have been killed or injured, and millions of civilians have fled their homes, since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Russia currently controls about 20% of Ukraine's territory and has been making slow advances along the front line as the Ukrainian military grapples with manpower shortages.Fighting has centred on the town of Pokrovsk, a logistical hub in Donetsk region, where hundreds of Russian troops recently broke through.Ukraine's ongoing refugee crisis took another turn this month when German Chancellor Friedrich Merz urged Zelensky to take action after a surge in the number of young Ukrainian men arriving in Germany and other EU states as refugees.EU states recorded 79,205 new Ukrainian refugees in September, the highest monthly number in nearly two years.In its report, the EU's statistical agency pointed to Ukraine's decision in August to allow men aged 18 to 22 the right to cross the border freely. At the time of the invasion, martial law dictated that men aged between 18 and 60 – even those not eligible for conscription, which is currently in place for those aged between 25 and 60 – were not permitted to leave the country.Germany, the EU's biggest country, now hosts the most Ukrainian refugees - currently 1.2 million people or 28.3% of the bloc's total.",

    "body": "19 hours agoCherylann Mollan,BBC News and Gopal Kateshiya and Roxy Gagdekar Chhara,BBC GujaratiGetty ImagesPolice say that they uncovered a massive cybercrime racket Hacked CCTV videos from a maternity hospital in India have been sold on Telegram, police say, raising serious questions about privacy and security in a country where such cameras have become commonplace.Earlier this year, police in Gujarat state were alerted by the media to videos on YouTube - some showed pregnant women undergoing medical exams and receiving injections in their buttocks - in a maternity hospital in a city. The videos had a link directing viewers to Telegram channels to buy longer videos. The director of the hospital told the BBC that the cameras had been installed for the safety of doctors. The BBC is not naming the city or hospital to protect the identity of the women in the videos. None of them have filed a police complaint.Police say their investigation uncovered a massive cybercrime racket where sensitive footage from at least 50,000 CCTVs from across the country was stolen by hackers and sold on the internet.CCTVs have become ubiquitous in India, especially in urban areas. They are installed in malls, offices, hospitals, schools, private apartment complexes and even inside people's homes.Experts warn that while CCTV boosts security, poorly installed or managed systems can threaten privacy. In India, cameras are often handled by staff without cybersecurity training, and some domestically manufactured models are reportedly easily exploitable.In 2018, a tech worker in Bengaluru city said that his webcam was hacked, and that the hacker demanded payment in exchange for not sharing his private videos. In 2023, a YouTuber reportedly found out that his home CCTV had been hacked after private videos went viral.Last year, the federal government asked states to not procure CCTVs from suppliers with a history of security and data breaches and also introduced new rules to improve cyber security of CCTV cameras. But hacking incidents like these are still reported.Getty ImagesCCTV cameras are ubiquitous in IndiaIn Gujarat, police say they ended up discovering a \"network of individuals spread across the country\".\"[They] were hacking into the video surveillance systems - or CCTV systems - of hospitals, schools, colleges, corporate offices and even the bedrooms of private individuals in multiple states,\" Lavina Sinha, who heads the Ahmedabad cyber crime department investigating the case, told reporters.Hardik Makadiya, Gujarat's top cybercrime official, says videos were sold for 800–2,000 rupees  ($9-22; £7-17, with Telegram channels offering live CCTV feeds via subscription.Police have registered a case under various sections of the law, including violating a female patient's privacy, publishing obscene material, voyeurism and cyber terrorism - which is a non-bailable offence. They say that they reached out to Telegram and YouTube, and the videos have been taken down.Since February, police have arrested eight people in the case - four from Maharashtra and others from Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Delhi, and Uttarakhand. They remain in judicial custody as the case proceeds in court.CCTV: Why do so many Indians love surveillance?Yash Koshti, lawyer for three of the accused, denied the allegations, saying they were not hackers or cyber criminals and that someone else carried out the breach.Cybercrime investigator Ritesh Bhatia warns that weakly protected CCTV and home networks are easy targets and must be properly secured.\"Wireless CCTV systems help you access the footage remotely, like on your smartphone or laptop. But once a system is connected to the web, it's easy for hackers to decode its IP address and default password. And once they get into the system, they can see or record live footage, download it or even shut down the system,\" Mr Bhatia says.He says that one way to secure surveillance systems is to change IP addresses and the default password.Mr Bhatia advises using a robust password that mixes letters, numbers, and symbols and cannot be found in a dictionary, and recommends periodic audits by a cybersecurity professional.He adds that CCTV manufacturers also bear responsibility, and their packaging should clearly warn users to replace default passwords with strong ones - similar to cigarette packet health warnings.Getty ImagesA CCTV surveillance sign in Tamil Nadu; such signs are common across IndiaMr Makadiya told the BBC that many of the hacked CCTVs used default passwords - like Admin123 - or weak ones.\"The hackers used brute force (the use of certain programmes to generate thousands of letter-number password combinations) to break into these systems and access videos,\" he said.Audrey Dmello of Majlis, a legal centre for women's and children's rights, highlights the ubiquity of CCTVs in India, often installed without consent. She urges organisations, especially in sensitive spaces, to ensure their systems are properly secured.\"Organisations and institutions that set up surveillance systems, especially in sensitive spaces, must see to it that their systems are adequately secured. It's an absolute must,\" she says.The director of one of the affected hospitals told the BBC the CCTVs in exam and injection rooms were meant to protect doctors from false allegations. He added that the cameras have since been removed from sensitive areas.Police in Gujarat told the BBC that neither the hospital nor any patient had come forward to file a formal complaint. The complaint was finally lodged by a police officer.\"Female patients fear that their identity will be revealed. Therefore, they are not willing to lodge a complaint,\" said an officer.Ms Dmello says that the shame women face around such incidents only adds to its horrific nature.\"When there is a sexual angle involved, the victim is re-victimised because of the patriarchal nature of Indian society. If we want women to assert their rights and we want criminals to be brought to justice, we, as a society, should first stop shaming and blaming women for the crime,\" she says.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "The US will help South Korea build nuclear 'attack' submarines - here's what that means1 day agoJake Kwon,Seoul and Gavin Butler,SingaporeGetty ImagesA file photo of the USS Kentucky nuclear submarine during a visit to South KoreaSouth Korea's government has announced that it has finalised an agreement to build nuclear-powered submarines in partnership with the United States.The US has approved the \"attack submarines\" and agreed to cooperate in sourcing fuel, according to a fact sheet released by the White House on Thursday.The agreement marks a significant step in South Korea's relations with the US and comes amid a period of growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula: with the nuclear-armed North Korea, and an expansionist China to the west.Here's what you need to know about the agreement. What's in the agreement? The agreement between the US and South Korea comes as leaders from both countries reached a broad trade deal earlier last month that would see reciprocal tariffs cut to 15% from 25%. US President Donald Trump had slapped a tariff rate on Seoul of 25% earlier this year - which his counterpart Lee Jae Myung managed to negotiate down to 15%, after Seoul said it would invest $350bn (£265bn) in the US, including $200bn in cash investment and $150bn in shipbuilding.In a White House readout released on Thursday, the US said it had \"given approval for the Republic of Korea to build nuclear-powered attack submarines... [and would] work closely to advance requirements for this project, including avenues to source fuel\".In an earlier post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump had said the vessels would be constructed at a shipyard in Philadelphia run by South Korean conglomerate Hanwha.Only six countries currently possess nuclear-powered strategic submarines: the US, China, Russia, the UK, France and India.South Korea already possesses about 20 submarines, but they are all diesel propelled and therefore need to surface far more frequently. Nuclear submarines are also able to operate further and faster.\"I have given them approval to build a nuclear-powered submarine, rather than the old-fashioned, and far less nimble, diesel-powered submarines that they have now,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.South Korea is a powerhouse when it comes to civilian nuclear energy. It had a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s but gave it up following US pressure. And so its ability to enrich or reprocess uranium is limited by the US as it is entirely dependent on imports. Why does South Korea want nuclear submarines? The latest vessel programme is aimed at countering North Korea, which recently revealed that it was pursuing its own nuclear submarine programme.President Lee had told Trump at the APEC summit last month that South Korea needed them for that express purpose.In a TV interview last week, Ahn Gyu-back, South Korea's Minister of Defence, said that nuclear submarines would be a \"proud achievement\" for South Korea, and a major leap in strengthening the country's defence against the North.The stealth of nuclear submarines would keep North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"awake at night\", he added. Getty ImagesUS President Donald Trump met his Korean counterpart in South Korea last monthDoes North Korea have nuclear submarines?North Korea has also been pursuing a nuclear submarine programme – possibly with Russia's help, according to South Korean officials.In March 2025, North Korea unveiled pictures of what it claimed was a nuclear-powered submarine that was under construction, showing Kim visiting the shipyard. Pyongyang is expected to have the submarines within the next few years.North Korea is also estimated to have an arsenal of approximately 50 nuclear weapons, as part of its broader nuclear weapons programme.Jo Bee-yun, a research fellow at the Sejong Institute, suggested that Seoul's acquisition of nuclear submarines will help it stay apace in East Asia's escalating arms race.\"North Korea's nuclear weapon is an established fact,\" she told the BBC. \"[South Korea acquiring] nuclear submarines is only a step in the larger trend of rising tension.\"Will this inflame tensions on the Korean Peninsula?It is unclear how much the nuclear-propelled submarines will contribute to South Korea's defence capabilities – and though they are very expensive, they don't quite change the balance of power on the Korean Peninsula, according to some experts.Yang Uk, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, told the BBC that the nuclear subs' primary purpose is to assure South Korean voters that their government is responding to North Korea's nuclear threat.\"South Korea cannot develop its own nuclear weapons to counter North Korea's,\" Dr Yang said. \"What's something that they can do? Fielding nuclear submarines.\"Dr Yang believes North Korea might revel in the change, however, because it reinforces their justification to hold on to nuclear weapons – meaning it will become more difficult to demand that Pyongyang give up its nuclear arsenal.Jo nonetheless emphasised the strategic advantage that South Korea stands to gain from the new submarine deal, describing it as a \"major change\" which \"means South Korea is now a regional player\". \"The best feature of a nuclear submarine is its speed,\" she said. \"It can now go fast and far and South Korea can operate together with more countries.\"What's in it for the United States?For Washington, support for South Korea's nuclear-powered submarine programme likely aims to put pressure on both North Korea and China.\"Trump has put the burden of defence spending on the back of South Korea,\" Dr Yang explained. \"South Korea will greatly expand its defence budget. They will act as America's proxy in putting pressure on China and North Korea.\"Getty ImagesDonald Trump is attempting to counter the influence of other nations in South Korea, according to expertsUS and China have long competed for strategic influence in South Korea, leaving Seoul to walk a geopolitical tightrope. More recently, China has been increasing its naval activity near South Korea's maritime border – a move akin to those seen in the South China Sea.Beijing must be \"furious\" about South Korea's nuclear submarine agreement with the US, Dr Yang said.Following the deal's announcement, the Chinese Ambassador to South Korea, Dai Bing, said he hoped South Korea would \"deal with this issue prudently, taking into consideration the concerns of all sides\".Dai also added that Beijing was engaging with Seoul on the matter through diplomatic channels, and emphasised that \"the (security) situation on the Korean Peninsula and in the region is still complex and sensitive\".What next?Although President Trump said the submarines would be built in Philadelphia and bring jobs to the US, South Korean officials have maintained they must be built locally, where existing facilities can deliver them in a much shorter timeline.South Korea's Prime Minister Kim Min-seok had himself said during a parliamentary hearing that the South Korean owned shipyard in Philadelphia did \"not have the capability\" to build such vessels, according to reports. Hanwha, who owns the shipyard, has yet to comment on the matter. But now that an agreement has been reached, the next step is to adjust the nuclear agreement between the two countries, allowing for the US to provide nuclear fuel and to set the fence for its military use.",

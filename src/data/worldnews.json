    "body": "20 hours agoCaroline Davies,Pakistan correspondent, Islamabad,Azizullah Khan,BBC Urdu, PeshawarandKelly NgTwo suicide bombers have attacked the headquarters of a Pakistani paramilitary force on Monday, killing three security officials and wounding at least 12 people.Police told BBC Urdu that the attackers were armed as they charged at the Federal Constabulary's headquarters in Peshawar in north-western Pakistan.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.The constabulary's complex is located in a highly secured area in Peshawar, and the attackers would have had to breach multiple levels of security to break in.Witnesses told local media they heard two loud explosions at around 08:10 local time (03:10 GMT) on Monday. The area has been cordoned off and rescue teams are currently on site. One official said five security officials and seven civilians were injured.Pakistan authorities have described the attack as a \"foiled terrorist plot\", noting that the attackers were gunned down at the gate, before they managed to enter the building.\"The perpetrators of this incident should be identified as soon as possible and brought to justice,\" said Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Pakistan's Federal Constabulary, previously known as the Frontier Constabulary, is responsible for handling situations beyond the capabilities of the police force, including tribal incursions and criminal gang violence.Peshawar is part of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which sits along the border Afghanistan and has long been a flashpoint for militant violence.The Pakistani Taliban, also known as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), is active in the province and had claimed responsibility for similar attacks across the country.Two weeks ago, a suicide attack outside a court in Pakistan's capital Islamabad killed 12 people and injured at least 27 others. Pakistan blamed India and Afghanistan, without proof. Both countries rejected these accusations.The TTP eventually claimed responsibility for the attack.In February this year, six people were killed in a suicide attack at an Islamic seminary in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The attack came ahead of the start of the holy month of Ramadan.No group has yet claimed responsibility for that attack.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump has said he agreed to visit Beijing in April and invited Chinese President Xi Jinping for a state visit later next year, following a phone call between the two leaders.Trump and Xi - who met nearly a month ago in South Korea - discussed a range of issues including trade, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, fentanyl and Taiwan, according to the president and China's foreign ministry.\"Our relationship with China is extremely strong!\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.China's state new agency released a statement that said both countries should \"keep up the momentum, keep moving forward in the right direction on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit\". The leaders met in Busan, South Korea in October, after which they agreed to a truce on tariffs. The US decided to cut a 20% tariff in half aimed at decreasing the flow of fentanyl. Tariffs remain on Chinese goods and average just below 50%. \"Since then, the China-US relationship has generally maintained a steady and positive trajectory, and this is welcomed by the two countries and the broader international community,\" the Chinese statement said.Xi and Trump find temporary truce as China plays longer gameTrade, tariffs and TikTok: Why it matters that Trump and Xi are talking againThe US then pulled back a threat of 100% additional tariffs on Chinese goods, while China delayed its plan to introduce its latest round of rare earth export controls. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Monday call with Xi - which lasted about an hour - was focused on trade.\"We are pleased with what we've seen from from the Chinese, and they feel the same way,\" she said.In addition to discussing trade, Xi and Trump broached the topics of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Taiwan.Xi told Trump that Taiwan's \"return to China\" is essential for China's vision for the \"post-war international order\".China has been marred in a diplomatic battle with Japan, a US ally, over the longstanding \"strategic ambiguity\" on the sovereignty of self-governed Taiwan.Earlier this month, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said any Chinese attack on Taiwan could force a Japanese military response.Trump, however, did not mention Taiwan in his Truth Social post about the call. US Ambassador to Japan, George Glass, previously said the US backs Tokyo in the wake of China's \"coercion\".",

    "body": "14 hours agoCachella SmithandPatrick JacksonBelgium is bracing for widespread disruption across sectors including public transport and schools this week as unions hold a three-day national strike. The action was called in response to Prime Minister Bart De Wever's attempts to shrink Belgium's debt by changing labour laws and reforming unemployment benefits and pensions. Teachers, medical staff and rubbish collectors will all be joining the rolling industrial action which is set to end in a general strike on Wednesday.  Eurostar is among organisations warning of potential disruption, while the two main airports have advised customers that all departure flights will be cancelled on Wednesday.The country had already been hit by several strikes since de Wever, a Flemish nationalist, came to office in February at the head of a centre-right coalition government aiming to cut the budget deficit.  Early on Monday, his government reached a budget agreement which he said was the only way to \"guarantee the sustainability\" of Belgium's welfare state. The country's budget deficit stood at 4.5% of GDP at the end of last year with debt at 104.7% of GDP.EU budget rules stipulate that member states should keep their budget deficit below 3% and debt beneath 60% to maintain sound public finances.This week's industrial action is meant to unfold in three stages, AFP news agency notes: Trains and other public transport went on strike on Monday, with national railroad company SNCB expecting to run one or two out of three trains, and several Eurostar services linking Brussels to Paris cancelledOn Tuesday, public services such as schools, creches and hospitals join inOn Wednesday a full general strike covers all categories including the two main airports, Bruxelles-Zaventem and Charleroi.Warning of the effect of the strike action in Belgium, Eurostar reported that some of its other international services had suffered delays as a result.  Defending the action, general workers union FGTB said a demonstration in Brussels two weeks ago had been met with \"total silence\" from the government. Fair pensions is a core issue cited by the unions while other demands include a fair wealth tax, a tax on digital activities for tech giants and the transparent screening of subsidies to companies.A day of action against violence against women separately took place on Sunday which the FGTB said formed part of the current action.Bruxelles-Zaventem airport has said it expects \"major disruptions\" to operations on Wednesday with all departure flights cancelled and some cancellations also possible for incoming flights.The airport said that staff from their security and handling service provider were expected to be participating in the national industrial action.Charleroi airport has similarly said it will not be able to operate either scheduled departures or arrivals on the day of the general strike - as it also warned passengers of potential disruption on public service networks throughout the strike period.The City of Brussels has warned of \"disrupted services\" on its public transport links throughout the three days of action while transport company, De Lijn, which operates in Flanders has advised there will be \"fewer bus and tram services\".",

    "body": "24 hours agoGavin ButlerNews1 / Seoul Metropolitan PolicePolice released a mugshot of Kim Nok-wan to Korean mediaThe leader of a Telegram sex crime ring which facilitated the exchange of thousands of sexual abuse materials has been sentenced to life imprisonment in South Korea.Kim Nok-wan, 33, was the head of the so-called Vigilantes: a large-scale, pyramid-style group that blackmailed victims into producing explicit content and sharing it in online chatrooms.Between May 2020 and January 2025, the Vigilantes exploited at least 261 individuals – the largest number of cybersex exploitation victims in South Korea's history.Under the self-designated title of \"pastor\", Kim was found to have carried out systematic crimes including the sexual assault of minors and the distribution of images that show child sex abuse.He was sentenced on Monday after being convicted for organising and operating a criminal organisation, producing and distributing sexually exploitative and illegally filmed material, forcing the use of illegally filmed material, and \"quasi-rape\" or sexual assault where the victim was unable to resist.\"[Kim Nok-wan] says in court that he is remorseful, but he committed countless crimes over the past four to five years,\" the court said.\"Considering the brutality of the crimes and the lack of restitution for victims, it is necessary to permanently isolate him from society.\"Kim sought out both male and female targets through social networking platforms, luring them to the instant-messaging service Telegram before blackmailing them, according to police.He approached men who expressed interest in creating or distributing deepfake images, and women who expressed sexual curiosity, then threatened to disclose their personal information or report them to authorities.Some of these victims would subsequently be recruited into the Vigilantes pyramid scheme – allocated titles such as \"evangelist\" and \"deacon\" - so that they could bring in further victims.Kim ordered both adult and child victims to submit \"hourly daily reports\" and write letters of remorse, punishing those who failed to do so by forcing them to take nude photographs or harm themselves.The quantity of sexually exploitative materials produced by the Vigilantes exceeded 2,000 pieces of media.As its ringleader, Kim also raped ten under-aged women, forced women to have sexual intercourse with other men and filmed himself committing brutal acts that caused injury, police added.He was found to have participated in at least 453 Telegram channels and chat rooms for the purpose of committing his crimes - 60 of which he operated personally.The case marks the first time Telegram has cooperated with South Korean police, providing crime-related data that facilitated further investigations and led to Kim's arrest.The Korean National Police Agency established a formal system of investigative cooperation with Telegram in October 2024, enabling the platform to officially provide authorities with relevant information.",

    "body": "Judge dismisses cases against ex-FBI director Comey and NY attorney general James11 hours agoAna FaguyComey: \"Donald Trump will probably come after me again\"A US judge has dismissed criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, ruling that the prosecutor who brought the charges was unlawfully appointed.Judge Cameron Currie said that Lindsey Halligan, who was handpicked by Trump to bring the charges against two of his political adversaries, was never eligible to assume the post.Both Comey and James have maintained their innocence and described the prosecutions as political in nature. In response to the ruling, the White House told the BBC:  \"The facts of the indictments against Comey and James have not changed and this will not be the final word on this matter.\"President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked Comey and James, declaring in one social media post, \"They're all guilty as hell\", and later adding \"JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\" In her decision on Monday, Judge Currie wrote that Halligan, a former White House aide who had never prosecuted a case before, was not authorised to present the charges to the grand jury.\"All actions flowing from Ms Halligan's defective appointment, including securing and signing Mr Comey's indictment, were unlawful exercises of executive power and are hereby set aside,\" Currie ruled.Getty ImagesLindsey HalliganHalligan was named as a replacement for Erik Siebert, an interim US attorney who resigned in September amid the Trump administration's pressure to file charges against both Comey and James.Judge Currie determined that Halligan's appointment violated the statute governing interim US attorneys. Under that law, the attorney general has 120 days to make an interim appointment - a period that began on 21 January with Siebert's designation, the judge noted.When that 120-day window closed on 21 May, the attorney general's authority to appoint an interim replacement expired as well, Judge Currie wrote. As a result, Halligan \"has been unlawfully serving in that role\" since her 22 September appointment.The cases were dismissed \"without prejudice\", meaning the justice department could potentially refile the case at a later date.The department did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the justice department would appeal against the dismissal of Comey and James's cases \"very soon\".She said the administration's position was that Halligan had been legally appointed. Leavitt also accused the judge of \"trying to shield\"  Comey and James.Getty ImagesLetitia JamesAfter the ruling, Comey said he was grateful a prosecution \"based on malevolence and incompetence\" had ended, but noted \"Trump will probably come after me again\".Comey was fired by Trump during his first term, after leading an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. The former FBI director was charged with making false statements and obstruction of justice in September, after Trump called for his prosecution and appointed a new federal prosecutor to pursue the case. James issued a statement saying she was \"heartened by today's victory\".\"I remain fearless in the face of these baseless charges as I continue fighting for New Yorkers every single day,\" the statement continued.James was facing federal charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. She previously brought charges against Trump before he won re-election, and later became a target of the Trump administration.

    "body": "The controversial, US and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) says it is winding down its aid operations in the Palestinian territory, after almost six months.The organisation had already suspended its three food distribution sites in Gaza after the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel took effect six weeks ago.The GHF aimed to bypass the UN as the main supplier of aid to Gaza's population. UN and other aid agencies refused to co-operate with its system, saying it was unethical and unsafe.Hundreds of Palestinians were killed while seeking food amid chaotic scenes near GHF's sites, mostly by Israeli fire, according to the UN. Israel said its troops fired warning shots.The GHF said on Monday that it was winding down operations now because of the \"successful completion of its emergency mission\", with a total of three million packages containing the equivalent of more than 187 million meals delivered to Palestinians.The GHF's executive director, Jon Acree, also said the US-led Civil-Military Coordination Centre (CMCC) - which has been set up to help implement US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan - would be \"adopting and expanding the model GHF piloted\".US state department spokesperson Tommy Piggott wrote on X: \"GHF's model, in which Hamas could no longer loot and profit from stealing aid, played a huge role in getting Hamas to the table and achieving a ceasefire.\"Hamas - which denies stealing aid - welcomed the closure of the GHF, Reuters reported.A Hamas spokesman said GHF should be held accountable for the harm it caused to Palestinians.\"We call upon all international human rights organisations to ensure that it does not escape accountability after causing the death and injury of thousands of Gazans and covering up the starvation policy practised by the (Israeli) government,\" Hazem Qassem wrote on his Telegram channel.The GHF began operations in Gaza on 26 May, a week after Israel had partially eased a total blockade on aid and commercial deliveries to Gaza that lasted 11 weeks and caused severe shortages of essential supplies. Three months later, a famine was declared in Gaza City.The GHF's food distribution sites in southern and central Gaza were operated by US private security contractors and located inside Israeli military zones.The UN and its partners said the system contravened the fundamental humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence, and that channelling desperate people into militarised zones was inherently unsafe.The UN's human rights office said it recorded the killing of at least 859 Palestinians seeking food in the vicinity of GHF sites between 26 May and 31 July. Another 514 people were killed near the routes of UN and other aid convoys, it added. Most of them were killed by the Israeli military, according to the office.The Israeli military said its troops had fired warning shots at people who approached them in a \"threatening\" manner.The GHF said there were no shootings at the aid sites and accused the UN of using \"false and misleading\" statistics from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.The GHF's future had been uncertain since Hamas and Israel agreed a ceasefire deal to implement the first phase of Trump's peace plan.It said aid distribution would take place \"without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner\" with Hamas and Israel.UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Monday that the GHF's shutdown would have \"no impact\" on its operations \"because we never worked with them\".He also said that while more aid was getting into Gaza since the ceasefire took effect on 10 October, it was \"not enough to meet all the needs\" of the 2.1 million population.",

    "body": "18 hours agoNomsa MasekoBBC Africa, JohannesburgOne of the daughters of Jacob Zuma, South Africa's former president, has filed a criminal complaint against her sister, accusing her of recruiting men from South Africa to fight in the Russia-Ukraine war.Nkosazana Zuma-Mncube alleged that Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, who serves as an MP, and two others tricked 17 men into fighting for Russian mercenaries.The men were told they were travelling to Russia to train as bodyguards for Jacob Zuma's political party Mkhonto Wesizwe (MK), Zuma-Mncube's statement says.The police say they are investigating the matter, while Zuma-Sambudla, aged 43, has not responded to the BBC's request for comment.South Africa's government previously said it had received distress calls from 17 citizens who had joined mercenary forces in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.The men, aged from 20 to 39, were lured to join the mercenary forces under the pretext of lucrative contracts, the government said.South Africa has an unemployment rate of more than 30%. Joblessness among young people is even higher, making them especially vulnerable for recruitment, analysts say.Zuma-Mncube said she had a \"moral obligation\" to file a police complaint against her younger sister.Earlier this week, international financial outlet Bloomberg reported similar allegations against Zuma-Sambudla and said some men had also been recruited from neighbouring Botswana.The allegations add to Zuma-Sambudla's legal woes - she is currently on trial over terrorism-related charges.The MP is being prosecuted over comments she made on social media four years ago during deadly protests in South Africa, following the arrest of her father.A week of anarchy in several parts of the country in July 2021, including looting and arson, left at least 300 people dead.Zuma-Sambudla has been accused of fuelling this unrest but she says the charges against her are politically motivated.Jacob Zuma was jailed for contempt of court for refusing to take part in an inquiry into allegations of corruption during his presidency that led to his sacking.He subsequently formed the MK party and led it to third place in last year's elections.The BBC has contacted MK and the Jacob Zuma Foundation for comment.",

    "body": "Illinois police captured Morgan Geyser, who was convicted in the 2014 stabbing of a classmate to appease Slender Man, an online character, after she fled a group home in neighbouring Wisconsin where she was being held.Police said Geyser, 23, removed her bracelet monitoring device and fled the home in Madison on Saturday night and was on the run until her capture on Sunday.Officers found her at a truck stop in Posen, Illinois, where they said Geyser told them to \"just Google\" her name and that she had \"done something really bad\".Geyser was 12 years old when she stabbed her classmate 19 times. She was sentenced to 40 years in a mental hospital in 2018 and granted conditional release in July.Geyser was found with a man at the truck stop just outside of Chicago - and about 170 miles south of Madison - after police received reports of a man and woman loitering.\"When officers arrived, they located both subjects sleeping on the sidewalk,\" Posen police said in a statement. \"The female repeatedly refused to provide her real name and initially gave a false one. \"After continued attempts to identify her, she finally stated that she didn't want to tell officers who she was because she had 'done something really bad,' and suggested that officers could 'just Google' her name.\"She and her companion were detained after police determined she was wanted in Wisconsin. CBS News, the BBC's US partner, reported the 42-year-old companion was charged with trespassing and obstructing identification and later released. The so-called \"Slender Man stabbing\" shocked Wisconsin and garnered national attention. Geyser and her friend Anissa Weier, also 12 at the time of the attack, lured a classmate to a park after a sleepover and Geyser stabbed the classmate repeatedly while Weier encouraged her to continue. The victim, 12-year-old Payton Leutner, survived the brutal attack and was found by a cyclist. Geyser and Weier were tried as adults. Geyser pleaded guilty to first-degree intentional homicide and was sentenced to 40 years. A judge allowed her release under supervision at the group home in July.Weier was charged with attempted murder and sentenced to 25 years in a psychiatric hospital but released in 2021.Geyser and Weier said they were inspired to attack their classmate after reading about Slender Man in a creepypasta, a short, online story designed to shock or scare the reader. Slender Man is a skinny, shadowy figure who has appeared in photos, drawings and articles across the internet. Some claim he has tentacles emerging from his back, and most say he wears dark clothes and has a pale face.The girls said they believed Slender Man would kill their relatives if they did not kill their friend to please him, an attorney for Geyser said in court. Authorities said the girls had hoped to live with Slender Man after the attack.Slender Man first appeared on the internet in 2009.The character was created by a Florida resident in response to a call for submissions from comedy website SomethingAwful. The character was pictured behind a crowd of people.After the stabbing, the website released an article urging people not to kill anyone because of Slender Man.",

    "body": "19 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentGetty ImagesJimmy Cliff's hits included Many Rivers To Cross, Wonderful World, Beautiful People and You Can Get It If You Really WantJimmy Cliff, one of the most prominent and beloved proponents of reggae music, has died at the age of 81.A star since the 1960s, he helped to bring the sound of Jamaica to a global audience through hits such as Wonderful World, Beautiful People and You Can Get It If You Really Want.His lead role as a gun-toting rebel in the 1972 crime drama The Harder They Come is a cornerstone of Jamaican cinema, and was attributed as the movie that brought reggae to America.Cliff's wife, Latifa Chambers, announced his death via a statement on Instagram.\"It's with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia,\" she wrote.\"I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists and coworkers who have shared his journey with him. \"To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career.\"Jimmy, my darling, may you rest in peace. I will follow your wishes.\" Her message was also signed by their children, Lilty and Aken.Getty ImagesBorn James Chambers in 1944, Cliff grew up as the eighth of nine children in abject poverty in the parish of St. James, Jamaica.Blessed with a sweet, mellifluous voice, he began singing at his local church at the age of six.He was inspired to write his own material when he heard ska pioneer Derrick Morgan on the radio - and asked his woodwork teacher how one might go about composing their own song. “He told me, ‘You just write it!’“ he told Mojo magazine. ”So I went ahead and… wrote a song called I Need A Fiancée, another called Sob Sob and I made a guitar out of bamboo to accompany myself.”By the time he was 14, he'd moved to Kingston and adopted the surname Cliff to express the heights he intended on reaching.He recorded a handful of singles before topping the Jamaican charts with his own composition, Hurricane Hattie. In 1965, he relocated to London to work with Island Records - later the home of Bob Marley - but the label's attempts to make his sound palatable to rock audiences were initially unsuccessful.He eventually struck gold with the 1969 single Wonderful World, Beautiful People - an upbeat, feelgood anthem; and the more politically-charged Vietnam, which Bob Dylan called \"the best protest song ever written\".Its lyric tells the story of a young soldier who writes from the war, promising his mother he'll be home soon; only for her to receive a telegram the next day, informing her of his death.Cliff reflected on the song in 1986, telling reggae archivist Roger Steffens: \"The essence of my music is struggle. What gives it the icing is the hope of love.\"Getty ImagesThe Harder They Come had to be subtitled in the US because of the character's thick Jamaican patoisThe musician became an international star with The Harder They Come, expressly written for the movie of the same name, in which he played Ivan Martin, a young man trying to break into Jamaica's corrupt music industry.\"The film opened the door for Jamaica,\" Cliff recalled. \"It said, 'This is where this music comes from.'\"BBC Sounds: Witness - Jimmy Cliff on The Harder They ComeBBC 6 Music: The First Time with Jimmy CliffCliff contributed four songs to the soundtrack, including the gospel hymn Many Rivers To Cross, which reflected his early days as a struggling artist in the UK.\"I was still in my teens,\" he later recalled. \"I came full of vigour: I'm going to make it, I'm going to be up there with the Beatles and the Stones.\"\"And it wasn't really going like that, I was touring clubs, not breaking through. I was struggling, with work, life, my identity. I couldn't find my place. Frustration fuelled the song.\"Instead, the film and its soundtrack won him international acclaim. Rolling Stone magazine even named it one of their top 500 albums of all time.During the 1980s, he collaborated with the Rolling Stones on their Dirty Work album, and he returned to the US charts in 1993 with his cover of I Can See Clearly Now, from the soundtrack for Cool Runnings, which followed the escapades of Jamaica's bobsled team.His other recordings included the Grammy Award-winning albums Cliff Hanger (1985) and Rebirth (2012), a nostalgic return to form.Cliff entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010, calling it \"a great thrill and an honour\".Inducting him, Fugees star Wyclef Jean said he'd been inspired by Cliff's success as a young boy growing up in Haiti.\"When we saw Jimmy Cliff, we saw ourselves,\" he said.Cliff continued to tour late into his life, playing Glastonbury's legends slot in 2003; and winning over a new generation of fans at the 2010 Coachella Festival.His contributions to Jamaican music and culture were recognised in October 2003 when he was awarded the country's prestigious Order of Merit.But the singer said his connection to fans was more important than any of the other honours bestowed upon him.Speaking to US radio station NPR in 2012, he reflected: \"When someone comes up to me and says, 'I was a dropout in school and I heard your song You Can Get It If You Really Want, and that song made me go back to school, and now I am a teacher and I use your song with my students' - that, for me, is a big success.\"",

    "body": "UK's Indo-Pacific Minister Seema Malhotra has defended her government's immigration proposals during a visit to India, while expressing concern about a rise in foreign students seeking asylum at the end of their studies.Under the new plans, some migrants could have to wait up to 20 years before they can settle permanently in the UK and the qualifying period for indefinite leave to remain will be extended from five to 10 years.The proposals will apply to an estimated 2.6 million people who arrived in the country since 2021. They have drawn criticism from some quarters, including a few Labour MPs, even though the Conservatives gave the measures a cautious welcome.The reforms are \"in line with what countries around the world do\" to stop the abuse of their immigration systems, Malhotra told the BBC in the southern Indian city of Chennai, adding that there was a \"very strong message we also send, which is that we welcome those coming legally\".According to Malhotra some16,000 international students from across the world had applied for asylum in the UK last year after completing their courses, which she said was evidence of abuse of legal migration routes.A further 14,800 students sought asylum this year to June 2025, latest Home Office figures show. It is unclear how many of them are Indian nationals.\"We've seen visa abuse in the case of legal routes, where people have gone legally and then sought to overstay when their visas weren't extended,\" Malhotra said.\"If you see that level of abuse, it undermines your immigration system. It undermines public confidence, and the fairness and control people expect.\"India remains one of the UK's biggest sources of international students, but demand is cooling. The number of Indian students heading to the UK has fallen 11% from last year as tougher immigration rules kick in. This has triggered concern among UK universities which rely on foreign students and are already under financial strain.According to the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, India was the top country of origin for foreign students in the UK in 2023-2024, making up 25% of arrivals. China followed at 23% while Nigeria made up 8%.Malhotra said while Britain still \"very much welcomes\" Indian students, her government was working with universities to ensure they are genuine foreign students. She said the recently concluded free trade agreement (FTA) between the UK and India had also encouraged UK universities to open local campuses in India, with Liverpool University announcing it will open a campus in Bengaluru city in 2026 last week.The FTA, signed in July after years of negotiations, is forecast to boost the UK's GDP by £4.8bn annually and expand bilateral trade between the two countries by £25.5bn.As part of the education chapter in the deal, nine UK universities have been cleared to set up campuses across India.However, these wider trade ambitions face a domestic political climate that has hardened around migration. During a visit to India in October, Sir Keir Starmer said the UK would not relax visa rules for Indian nationals despite Delhi's long-standing push for easier mobility in return for trade concessions.Malhotra rejected the idea that Britain wants deeper trade while shutting the door to Indian professionals, citing the nearly half-a-million visas granted to Indian nationals last year across work, study and visitor categories.The UK is moving towards a \"contribution-based\" immigration system, where settlement and long-term stay depend on a person's economic contribution rather than the length of time they have lived in the country, Malhotra said.The government's proposal to overhaul the UK's immigration system is part of a broader attempt to show firmer control over borders, but has drawn criticism from some Labour MPs and members of the House of Lords, particularly over their potential impact on international recruitment in sectors like healthcare and social care.While the reforms are still under consultation, Malhotra, when asked about settlement routes for migrant professionals like nurses and care workers said, \"we are expanding routes for those with skills in areas that the UK requires\". A survey by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) had warned that up to 50,000 nurses could leave the UK if the government went ahead with its immigration proposals.The report notes that the UK now has more than 200,000 internationally educated nursing staff, making up around 25% of the country's total nursing workforce of 794,000.A significant number of these nurses and care workers are from India. Several investigations, including by the BBC, have shown that many of them have fallen prey to cross-border visa scams and lost hundreds of thousands of pounds.But Malhotra said the UK was ramping up efforts to protect people from such exploitation and working with law enforcement agencies of countries like India to share intelligence and crack down on such gangs.

    "body": "20 hours agoPaul NjieBBC Africa, YaoundéAFP via Getty ImagesTchiroma Bakary has vowed to resist President Paul Biya's governmentCameroonian opposition leader Issa Tchiroma Bakary, who is contesting the outcome of the presidential election, has fled to The Gambia for his safety, The Gambian government has said.Tchiroma Bakary has insisted he is the legitimate winner of the 12 October election, alleging that the result was rigged to give President Paul Biya, 92, an eighth term. The Gambian information ministry said on Sunday that Tchiroma Bakary arrived on 7 November and was allowed to stay on humanitarian grounds.Cameroon's government had threatened to put him on trial for allegedly inciting violent post-election demonstrations. He denied the allegation, and blamed the security forces for a crackdown on protesters.The government put the number of people killed in post-election violence at 16, but other organisations have given a higher death toll.Tchiroma Bakary has repeatedly promised to resist Biya's government until his \"victory\" in the election is recognised.Biya, the world's oldest president, has been in power for 43 years, and was declared the winner with 53.7% of the vote amid allegations of fraud. Tchiroma Bakary, who served in Biya's government for many years, came second with 35.2%.His resistance tactics have included calling for street protests and \"ghost town\" operations aimed at bringing cities and towns to a standstill.Until The Gambian government confirmed his presence, his whereabouts had remained a mystery although there was speculation that he had fled to another country in the region.\"He is being hosted temporarily in The Gambia purely on humanitarian grounds in the spirit of African solidarity and for the purpose of ensuring his safety while discussions continue to pursue a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to the post-electoral tensions in Cameroon,\" The Gambian government said in a statement.The Gambian authorities said the country would not be used as a \"base for subversive activity against any state\".The BBC has reached out to the Cameroonian government for comment.Reacting to the announcement, The Gambia's main opposition United Democratic Party (UDP) criticised the government for withholding the announcement of Tchiroma Bakary's arrival until Sunday.It said it raised \"serious questions about transparency, accountability, and respect for The Gambian people's right to know what actions are taken in their name\".However, the party said it was proud that Tchiroma Bakary could find \"safe sanctuary\" in The Gambia, adding that it was fully aware of how \"despotism operates and how dissenters are treated\".You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

She went on to helm Spring restaurant at Somerset House and Marle and Hearth at Heckfield Place in Hampshire.Gyngell's family said she died on Saturday in London, describing her as a \"culinary visionary who influenced generations of chefs and growers globally to think about food and its connection to the land\". Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver paid tribute to Gyngell - who was diagnosed with skin cancer last year - and thanked her for \"all you did to inspire young cooks\".During the 1980s, Gyngell pioneered the \"slow food movement\" before becoming a private chef for clients including Nigella Lawson, Madonna and Guy Ritchie.Lawson mourned her death, writing on Instagram, \"However ill you know someone to be, their death is always a shock. It's just awful that Skye is no longer in the world.\"Gyngell died just days after her mother, Ann Barr, who was a well-known interior designer.Her father, Bruce Gyngell, was the first person to appear on Australian television in 1956 with the line: \"Good evening, and welcome to television\". He died in 2000.Born in Sydney, Skye Gyngell was studying at Sydney University when she realised the culinary world was where she wanted to be. She moved to Paris at 19, where she trained and worked under acclaimed chefs including at the two Michelin-starred restaurant Dodin-Bouffant.Gyngell later moved to London and worked at the French House in Soho with Fergus and Margot Henderson.In 2004, Gyngell became head chef at Petersham Nurseries cafe in Richmond, where she  turned the dilapidated site into a thriving cafe, and in 2011, it was awarded a Michelin star.But the kudos was a double-edged sword for Gyngell, who left the cafe a year after the award, saying she was frustrated by customers who expected a traditional Michelin experience at her rustic cafe.Her later ventures included Spring at Somerset House, which was the first single-use plastic-free restaurant in London. Gyngell, who overcame drug and alcohol addiction in her younger years, was also known for her award-winning cookbooks and wrote columns for Vogue as its food editor.Last year, she found a lump in her neck and was diagnosed with Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare and aggressive skin cancer.She underwent an operation which included the removal of her salivary glands, causing her to temporarily lose her sense of smell and taste.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "Pentagon to review Senator Mark Kelly misconduct allegations after video to troops13 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinandNardine SaadWatch: Mark Kelly was trying to \"intimidate\" active duty service members, says LeavittThe Pentagon on Monday said it is reviewing \"serious allegations of misconduct\" against US Democratic Senator Mark Kelly. Kelly, a retired US Navy captain, was one of six Democratic lawmakers who released a video urging military members to refuse unlawful orders. The announcement in a post on the Department of War X account did not detail the allegations against Kelly, but suggested the move is in response to Kelly's statements: \"All servicemembers are reminded that they have a legal obligation under the UCMJ to obey lawful orders and that orders are presumed to be lawful.\" Kelly said he learned of the investigation via the Pentagon's social media post on Monday. \"If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won't work,\" Kelly responded on X.In addition to the Pentagon, US President Donald Trump posted on social media last week accusing Kelly and other Democratic lawmakers of \"seditious behavior, punishable by death\". \"I've given too much to this country to be silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution.\"Bloomberg via Getty ImagesSenator Mark Kelly is being investigated by the US Department of WarKelly was a combat pilot in the US Navy who served during the first Gulf War and later flew four space missions for Nasa from 2001 to 2011. He is married to former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who retired after being shot during a 2011 mass shooting.Even though he retired from the military, he is still subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) - a federal law enacted by Congress in 1951 that subjects members of the military to a special set of rules.It applies to all active-duty members as well as activated National Guard and Reserve members, military academy students and some civilians serving in support of the military during wartime. It also applies to retirees and gives the military the ability to recall retirees for applicable offences, such as disobeying federal laws that \"prohibit actions intended to interfere with the loyalty, morale, or good order and discipline of the armed forces\".The Pentagon said on Monday that further action may be taken against Kelly, including a recall to active duty for court-martial or administrative measures.In the statement, the Pentagon said the matter would be \"handled in compliance with military law, ensuring due process and impartiality\", and that further official comment would be limited \"to preserve the integrity of the proceedings\".\"All servicemembers are reminded that they have a legal obligation under the UCMJ to obey lawful orders and that orders are presumed to be lawful.  A servicemember's personal philosophy does not justify or excuse the disobedience of an otherwise lawful order.\"The video by Democrats, all of whom have served in the military or intelligence community, was shared by Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin and features Kelly and US Representatives Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander, Chrissy Houlahan and Jason Crow. In it, they tell military members they do not need to obey illegal commands.Kelly says in the video: \"Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders.\"\"This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens,\" the video says.\"Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this constitution. Right now, the threats coming to our constitution aren't just coming from abroad but from right here at home.\"Trump reacted to the video in a series of irate Truth Social posts on Thursday, accusing the lawmakers of \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL\".\"Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL. Their words cannot be allowed to stand,\" he wrote. \"An example MUST BE SET.\" His remarks were met with bipartisan condemnation and the president - who is the commander-in-chief of armed forces - walked back those statements in a Fox interview on Friday, clarifying that he was \"not threatening death\" against the Democratic lawmakers.Reposting the Pentagon statement on X on Monday, defence secretary Pete Hegseth called the Democrats' video \"despicable, reckless, and false,\" referring to the lawmakers as the \"Seditious Six\".He said that encouraging US warriors to ignore their commanders' orders \"undermines every aspect of 'good order and discipline'\".\"Their foolish screed sows doubt and confusion — which only puts our warriors in danger,\" he wrote, singling out Kelly as the only one of the six who is still subject to the UCMJ. \"As was announced, the Department is reviewing his statements and actions, which were addressed directly to all troops while explicitly using his rank and service affiliation—lending the appearance of authority to his words,\" Hegseth wrote. He added that Kelly's conduct \"brings discredit upon the armed forces and will be addressed appropriately\".",

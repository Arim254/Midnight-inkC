    "body": "3 hours agoAmy WalkerGelsenkirchen PolicePolice say the thieves used a parking garage to gain access to the branchThieves used a large drill to break into a safe at a high street bank branch in western Germany and steal an estimated €30m (£26m; $35m) in cash and valuables, police have said.A police spokesman likened the break-in to the Hollywood heist film Ocean's Eleven, telling AFP news agency it was \"very professionally executed\".During the heist at Sparkasse savings bank in the city of Gelsenkirchen, thieves broke open more than 3,000 safe deposit boxes containing money, gold and jewellery. Gelsenkirchen Police said they became aware of the crime after a fire alarm was set off in the early hours of Monday morning.Currently, no arrests have been made and the perpetrators remain at large.Police said the thieves had used the \"quiet Christmas days\" to rob the building on Nienhofstrasse in the Buer district.Initial investigations suggest they gained access to the bank, and escaped, via an adjacent parking garage.Witnesses have reported seeing several men carrying large bags in the staircase of the garage overnight on Saturday into Sunday. Police said video footage shows a black Audi RS 6 leaving the garage, on De-La-Chevallerie-Strasse, early on Monday morning.The hole into the underground vault room was discovered when a fire alarm went off in the early hours of Monday, and police and the fire brigade searched the building.Affected bank customers have been asked to contact Sparkasse bank, which has set up a hotline. Police secured the entrance of the branch on Tuesday after a large number of customers gathered outside demanding information.Watch: Bank customers demanded to be let in following heistA message on the bank's website said the branch would remain closed on Tuesday following the break-in.Sparkasse said 95% of customers' safe deposit boxes had been forced open by the thieves, so the likelihood they were affected is \"very high\". It added that the contents of each compartment are insured up to €10,300 and told customers to check if they had additional coverage through their home insurance.",

    "body": "Protests and strikes in Iran over inflation and currency devaluation have spread from the capital, Tehran, to several other cities on a third day of unrest.The protests began on Sunday after shopkeepers in Tehran's Grand Bazaar staged a strike when the Iranian rial hit a record low against the US dollar on the open market.Since then, videos verified by BBC Persian have shown demonstrations in the cities of Karaj, Hamedan, Qeshm, Malard, Isfahan, Kermanshah, Shiraz and Yazd. Police were also seen using tear gas in an attempt to disperse demonstrators.The Iranian government said it \"recognises the protests\" and would listen \"with patience, even if it is confronted with harsh voices\".President Masoud Pezeshkian wrote on X late on Monday that he had instructed the interior minister to hold talks with what he described as \"representatives\" of the protesters so that measures could be taken \"to resolve the problems and act responsibly\".He also accepted the resignation of Iran's central bank governor, Mohammadreza Farzin, and named former economy and finance minister Abdolnasser Hemmati to replace him.University students have also joined the protests, chanting anti-government slogans including \"Death to the dictator\" - a reference to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate power in Iran.Some protesters were also heard chanting slogans in support of the son of the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, including \"Long live the Shah\".In response, Reza Pahlavi, who lives in exile in the United States, wrote on X: \"I am with you. Victory is ours because our cause is just and because we are united.\"\"As long as this regime remains in power, the country's economic situation will continue to deteriorate,\" he added.The US state department's Persian-language account on X also expressed support for the protests.It said the US \"praises their courage\" and stands with those seeking \"dignity and a better future\" after years of failed policies and economic mismanagement.Iran was reportedly high on the agenda of a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Florida on Monday,At a joint news conference afterwards, Trump declined to say whether he supported regime change in Iran, but said: \"They've got a lot of problems: tremendous inflation, their economy is bust, their economy is no good, and I know people aren't so happy.\"The president also said he might back another round of Israeli air strikes on Iran if the country rebuilt its ballistic missile or nuclear programmes.During a 12-day war between Israel and Iran in June, the US carried out air strikes on key Iranian uranium enrichment sites. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful.President Pezeshkian vowed on Tuesday that Iran's response to \"any oppressive act of aggression\" would be \"severe and regret-inducing\".Iran's supreme leader has repeatedly said that Israel's government hoped mass protests would erupt in Iran during the war and topple the regime.\"They wanted to create sedition on the streets... But people were absolutely not influenced by what the enemy wanted,\" Khamenei said in September.",

    "body": "The two alleged gunmen who killed 15 people at a Jewish event on Bondi Beach were not part of a wider terror cell and acted alone, Australian police have said.Police also confirmed Sajid Akram, 50, and his son Naveed Akram, 24, travelled to the Philippines on 1 November, landing in the capital Manila before transiting that day to Davao City. They returned to Sydney on 29 November.The pair did not undergo training or \"logistical preparation\" in the Philippines for the 14 December attack with early investigations from local authorities suggesting they \"rarely left their hotel,\" police said.Police have declared the attack - Australia's worst mass shooting since 1996 - a terrorist incident.Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett told media on Tuesday that CCTV footage tracking the alleged gunmen's movements in the Philippines had been handed to Australian authorities. \"We are currently reviewing the material,\" she said, adding that initial assessments show that \"these individuals are alleged to have acted alone\".\"There is no evidence to suggest these alleged offenders were part of a broader terrorist cell, or were directed by others to carry out an attack.\"But nor were the pair in the Philippines for tourism, Commissioner Barrett said.She emphasised that as the investigation was ongoing, new evidence or information may emerge.Earlier, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said it appears both alleged gunmen were  \"motivated by Islamic State\" ideology.Sajid Akram was shot dead by police during the attack in which he and his son Naveed - both armed with long-barrelled guns - allegedly shot attendees at a Hanukkah event on Bondi Beach.Naveed, who was hospitalised after the attack, has been charged with 59 offences including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act and is due to face court in April.In the days after the shooting, the Philippines immigration bureau told the BBC that the father had entered the country using an Indian passport while his son used an Australian passport. Immigration spokesperson Dana Sandoval said the duo had declared the southern city of Davao as their final destination and their return flight to Australia was for Sydney.Davao is a sprawling metropolis on the east of the Philippines' main southern island, Mindanao. Islamist militants have been known to operate in impoverished parts of central and south-western Mindanao.Additional reporting by Virma Simonette.",

    "body": "10 hours agoSofia Ferreira SantosX/Ali YerlikayaA video shared on social media by Turkey's interior minister appears to show several people being detainedMore than 350 suspected Islamic State group (IS) members have been detained as part of nationwide police operations in Turkey.Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said 357 suspects were apprehended across 21 provinces in coordinated raids on Tuesday morning.It comes just a day after three police officers and six alleged militants were killed during an eight hour siege in the northwestern town of Yalova. Another eight police officers and a security force member were injured.Less than a week ago, authorities arrested another 115 suspects who prosecutors said had been planning attacks targeting non-Muslims during Christmas and New Year's.In a post on X, Yerlikaya said Tuesday's operations took place across the country, including in Ankara, Istanbul and Yalova.\"Just as we have never given an opportunity to those who try to bring this country to its knees with terrorism, we will never give them an opportunity in the future either,\" he added.The interior minister also shared a video appearing to show dozens of counter-terrorism officers taking part in the operations and detaining several people.Raids on addresses in Istanbul and two other provinces - where 110 people were detained, according to the prosecutor's office - saw officers seize documents and digital materials, while pictures on local media also showed a number of weapons, including knifes and bullets.A statement from the Istanbul chief prosecutor's office said intelligence had suggested the suspects might attempt an attack on New Year's Day.It also noted 41 of those detained had suspected links to the clash in Yalova on Monday.Interior minister Yerlikaya said another 16 individuals had been detained in Yalova for making \"provocative posts\" on social media.The funerals of the three offices killed in Yalova - named as  İlker Pehlivan, Turgut Külünk, and Yasin Koçyiğit - were held on Tuesday.President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan offered his condolences to their families, and said Turkey would continue its fight against \"bloodthirsty criminals who threaten the peace of our nation and the security of our state\".Earlier this month, authorities carried out mass raids and arrested 115 people. Officials said IS supporters had been actively planning attacks across Turkey, particularly against non-Muslims on Christmas and New Year's Day.ReutersThe siege on a house in Yalova lasted around eight hours, according to local mediaTurkey's security services regularly target people with suspected links to IS.The country shares a 900km (560 mile) border with Syria, where the group continues to operate in parts of the country.Syria's president Ahmed al-Sharaa, who has close ties to the Turkish government, has vowed to work with the US and Europe to root out surviving elements of IS.The US launched a wave of air strikes against the group's positions across Syria on Friday in response to the killing of three Americans.Two US soldiers and a civilian interpreter were killed by IS gunmen during an ambush earlier this month.",

    "body": "9 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorCharly Hel/Prestige/Getty ImagesBrigitte Bardot died on Sunday aged 91 and had long shunned the limelight, preferring the company of animalsFrench right-wing figure Éric Ciotti has called for a national tribute to honour film legend Brigitte Bardot, prompting objections from political opponents on the left.\"France has a duty to honour its Marianne,\" said Ciotti, referring to the emblem of French liberty whose face Bardot was chosen to represent in the 1960s.Bardot died on Sunday aged 91. A petition launched by Ciotti since has attracted more than 23,000 signatures, and has the backing of some allies on the far right.But Socialist leader Olivier Faure has pointed out that national homages are for \"exceptional services to the nation\". Bardot was an iconic actress but she also \"turned her back on republican values\", Faure argued.Bardot has been hailed by President Emmanuel Macron as a \"legend of the century\" who embodied a life of freedom, and Ciotti, who leads the right-wing UDR party, has appealed to him to organise a national send-off.  Ciotti said France should recognise a woman who brought her country an extraordinary level of international recognition and actively helped in the fight for  women's liberty and abortion rights.Meanwhile, the mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, has announced that his city will name an \"iconic site\" in Bardot's honour. But Bardot is destined to remain controversial in death as she was during her life. Faure pointed out that she had been convicted five times for inciting racial hatred.Bardot starred in some 50 films, after bursting on to the scene in And God Created Woman in 1956. She then left the world of cinema in 1973 for a life devoted to animal welfare, and lived for decades in Saint-Tropez on the French Riviera, at her home called La Madrague.But she became as well known for her far-right sympathies as she was for her love of animals. Some of her remarks targeted Muslims, and others insulted the people of the French Indian Ocean island of Réunion.\"To be moved by the plight of dolphins and yet be indifferent to the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean - what degree of cynicism is that?\" asked Green MP Sandrine Rousseau on social media.There are differing types of national tribute in France. Robert Badinter, who abolished the death penalty in France, was honoured with a national homage in the form of a solemn ceremony in 2024, as was singer Charles Aznavour in 2018. A more likely option for Bardot would be along the lines of the public farewell given to rock star Johnny Hallyday, when large crowds lined the streets of Paris in 2017.Not everyone on the left is opposed to the idea of a national homage to Bardot.\"Why not? We've done it for other figures, particularly Johnny Hallyday,\" Socialist MP Philippe Brun told French radio. \"If the president of the republic decides on it, I don't see why we should oppose it.\"MIGUEL MEDINA/AFPBardot will be buried near her family's graves in the marine cemetery in Saint-TropezBardot herself had shunned the limelight for decades and close friend Wendy Bouchard said she was not remotely interested in medals and ceremonies.\"It probably comes from a good place, but I'm not sure that she, who lived a life of simplicity and deprivation, would have wanted this national homage,\" she told French TV.Journalist Steven Bellery, who interviewed Bardot earlier this year, agreed she wanted something far more simple and intimate.Bardot had asked to be buried at her Riviera home at La Madrague, rather than in a public cemetery, where she feared \"a crowd of idiots might damage the graves of my parents and grandparents\".However, the town hall in Saint-Tropez has said she will have a private burial in the public cemetery that overlooks the Mediterranean as well as her home.The Brigitte Bardot Foundation, which is dedicated to animal welfare, says her funeral will take place on 7 January at the Notre-Dame de l'Assomption church and will be broadcast on screens across the town.",

    "body": "2 hours agoDavid GrittenEPAThe UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) seeks independence for southern YemenThe United Arab Emirates has said it will withdraw its remaining forces from Yemen, after Saudi Arabia backed a demand from the Yemeni presidential council for them to leave within 24 hours.The Emirati announcement followed an air strike by a Saudi-led military coalition on what it said was a weapons shipment for UAE-backed separatist forces in the southern port of Mukalla.The UAE denied the shipment contained weapons and expressed \"deep regret\" at the Saudi accusations. Saudi and the UAE have been allies in the war against Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi movement over the past decade, but the infighting between the rival factions they support has deepened a rift between them.Saudi Arabia also accused the UAE of \"pressuring\" the separatists to attack Saudi-backed government forces in two eastern provinces, and warned it would take measures to confront such \"highly dangerous\" actions.On Tuesday afternoon, the UAE's defence ministry put out a statement announcing \"the termination of the remaining counterterrorism personnel in Yemen of its own volition\", six years after the UAE's armed forces had \"concluded\" their presence.The ministry explained that the decision to withdraw them was made \"in light of recent developments and their potential implications for the safety and effectiveness of counterterrorism missions\", without mentioning the coalition strike or Saudi warning.The strongly worded statement issued by Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry on Tuesday morning said it was working to \"contain the escalatory steps\" taken recently by the Southern Transitional Council (STC), which seeks independence for southern Yemen.It accused the UAE of \"pressuring\" the STC to conduct offensives in the eastern provinces of Hadramawt and al-Mahra, which it said constituted \"a threat to the kingdom's national security, and the security and stability of the Republic of Yemen and the region\". It also warned that Saudi Arabia would take measures to confront such \"highly dangerous\" actions.The UAE's foreign ministry denounced the allegations that it \"exerted pressure on, or issued directives to, any Yemeni party to undertake military operations that would undermine the security of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or target its borders\".It also insisted that the UAE had \"focused on containing the situation, supporting de-escalation efforts, and promoting understandings to contribute to preserving security and stability\" since the start of the STC's offensives.The head of Yemen's eight-member presidential council - which includes STC representatives - earlier announced that he was cancelling a joint defence pact with the UAE and ordering its forces to leave within 24 hours \"in the interest of safeguarding the security of all citizens, affirming commitment to Yemen's unity, sovereignty, stability, and territorial integrity\".Rashad al-Alimi also declared a state of emergency for a period of 90 days, which he said was necessary to confront the Houthis and what he described as \"the internal strife led by mutinous military elements that received orders from the United Arab Emirates\".The STC's leaders said the ultimatum for the UAE's withdrawal was unilateral and had no legal basis, and insisted the UAE would remain a \"main partner\" in the battle against the Houthis.AFPThe Saudi-led coalition air strike on Mukalla destroyed a number of military vehicles and pick-up trucksAlimi's announcement came after the spokesman of the Saudi-led coalition - which includes the UAE - said it had carried out a \"limited\" air strike on weapons and military vehicles for the STC's forces in the southern Yemeni port of Mukalla which arrived on two ships from the UAE.The shipments had constituted \"an imminent threat and an escalation that threatens peace and stability\", Maj-Gen Turki al-Maliki asserted.An official at the port told AFP news agency that a warning to evacuate was received at 04:00 local time (01:00 GMT) and that an open area at the facility was struck about 15 minutes later.Pictures showed a number of burned out military vehicles and pick-up trucks in a walled-off area at the port, as well as damage to a nearby building. No casualties were reported.The UAE's foreign ministry said it had been surprised by the strike on Mukalla and that the coalition statement had been issued without consultation with member states.It insisted that the shipment in question \"did not include any weapons, and that the vehicles unloaded were not intended for any Yemeni party but were shipped for use by Emirati forces operating in Yemen\".On Saturday, the Saudi-led coalition called on the STC's forces to withdraw \"peacefully\" from Hadramawt and al-Mahra, a day after the Saudi air force reportedly bombed positions held by the separatists in the Wadi Nahab area of Hadramawt.The STC's forces launched offensives in the two provinces amid rising tensions earlier this month, putting them in direct conflict with government forces.It said the operations were necessary to \"restore stability\" in the south and to combat the Houthis, as well as the jihadist groups al-Qaeda and Islamic State (IS).Yemen has been devastated by a civil war that began in 2014, when the Houthis ousted the internationally recognised government from the capital Sanaa. The conflict escalated in 2015, after the Saudi-led coalition of Arab states intervened to restore the government's rule.The fighting has reportedly left more than 150,000 people dead and triggered one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.At the start of the war, the STC and other separatists seeking independence for south Yemen, which was a separate country before unification with the north in 1990, formed an uneasy alliance with the government to stop the Houthis capturing the southern city of Aden.However, in recent years the STC and its allies have turned on the government and gradually seized control of Aden and much of the south of the country.",

    "body": "The Spanish parishioner who made headlines around the world for her botched restoration of a prized Jesus Christ fresco has died aged 94.Cecilia Giménez, an elderly woman from Borja, northeast Spain, became famous 13 years ago after she attempted to restore the century-old painting titled Ecce Homo that was held in her local church.Giménez's restoration went viral and earned the nickname \"Monkey Christ\", because of Christ's head resembling a hairy monkey. The 94-year-old's death was confirmed by Borja's mayor, Eduardo Arilla, in a Facebook post, in which he recognised her as a \"great lover of painting from a young age\".Mayor Arilla paid tribute to Giménez's \"famous restoration of Ecce Homo\" in August 2012, which \"due to the poor state of conservation it presented, Cecilia, with the best intentions, decided to repaint the work over\".The Ecce Homo (\"Behold the Man\" in Latin) by 19th century painter Elias Garcia Martinez has been held for more than 100 years in the Sanctuary of Mercy Church near Zaragoza. In 2012, Giménez, then 81, told BBC News that church members had \"always repaired everything here\", and that she had permission from the local priest to do so. Giménez said at the time anybody who entered the Church would have seen she was painting over the original. The impact of the restoration led to the \"Monkey Christ\" meme and saw the once quiet town of Borja quickly become a tourist destination. The town, which had previously welcomed just 5,000 visitors per year, received more than 40,000 tourists by 2013, and raised more than €50,000 for charity at the time. Officials say nowadays between 15,000 and 20,000 tourists per year visit Borja to see the famous portrait, which is now behind a protective shield of glass.After recovering from the backlash, with support from local residents and others around the world, Giménez went on to stage an art exhibition with 28 of her own paintings. She was praised by Borja's mayor for her generosity and years of dedication to the church. \"Rest in peace Cecilia, we will always remember you,\" Mayor Arilla wrote on Facebook.",

    "body": "Favour Nunoo,BBC AfricaandOmega Rakotomalala,BBC MonitoringGuinea's junta leader Gen Mamady Doumbouya has taken a huge lead in a presidential election his main challengers were barred from contesting, initial results show.Gen Doumbouya is hoping to legitimise his rule after seizing power in a coup four years ago.A civil society group campaigning for the return of civilian rule condemned the election as a \"charade\", while opposition candidates said the poll was marred by irregularities.On Monday, internet monitoring organisation NetBlocks reported that access to social media platforms TikTok, YouTube and Facebook had been restricted as Guineans waited for the full results.There has been no official comment on the restrictions, but opponents see it as an attempt by the junta to stifle criticism of the results.Gen Doumbouya, 41, won more than 80% of the vote in numerous districts in capital city Conakry, according to official partial results read out on television by Djenabou Toure, head of the General Directorate of Elections.Gen Doumbouya had a big lead in several other areas as well, including Boffa and Fria in the west, Gaoual in the north-west, northern Koundara and Labe, and Nzerekore in the south-east.After overthrowing then-83-year-old President Alpha Condé in 2021, he promised not to seek election and to hand power to a civilian.\"Neither I nor any member of this transition will be a candidate for anything... As soldiers, we value our word very much,\" he said at the time.Gen Doumbouya broke his promise by putting his name on the ballot after a new constitution, implemented in September, permitted him to run for office. Eight other candidates took part in Sunday's election, but with the exclusion of main opposition parties RPG Arc en Ciel and UFDG, none of the participants have a solid political footing. Although he is popular with many of Guinea's youth, Gen Doumbouya has been criticised for restricting opposition activities, banning protests and stifling press freedom in the run-up to the elections.The general justified deposing Condé on similar charges - including rampant corruption, disregard for human rights and economic mismanagement.Guinea has the world's largest bauxite reserves and some of its richest iron ore. Last month, authorities launched the gigantic Simandou iron-ore mine to widespread anticipation.However, over half of the population lives in poverty, according to World Bank figures.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has said he is not worried about China's military drills around the self-governed island of Taiwan, which it claims as its own.\"I have a great relationship with President Xi [Jinping], and he hasn't told me anything about [the drills]. I certainly have seen it,\" Trump told reporters at a press conference on Monday. \"No, nothing worries me. They've been doing naval exercises for 20 years in that area,\" he said of the drills, which have ramped up in recent years and now include simulating a blockade of the island. The drills, which began on Monday, take place nearly two weeks after the US announced one of its largest-ever arms sales to Taiwan. The drills are a warning against \"Taiwan independence separatist forces\" and \"external interference\", the Chinese military said.They include 10 hours of live-firing exercises in the sea and airspace of five locations surrounding the island.The Chinese military's Eastern Theater Command in charge of the Taiwan Strait said it has lined up destroyers, frigates and fighter-bombers to test \"sea-air coordination\" and \"integrated containment capabilities\".Taiwan's defence ministry said it detected 130 Chinese military aircraft around the island on Tuesday morning, 90 of which crossed the \"median line\" - an unofficial border dividing China and Taiwan, the validity of which China rejects.Such incursions, however, have been happening even when there are no drills, as Beijing practises so-called grey-zone warfare tactics aimed at weakening Taiwan's defences over a prolonged period.The Taiwanese ministry said on Tuesday that it had spotted more than a dozen Chinese navy vessels near the island. Taiwan's armed forces monitored the situation and have deployed aircraft, ships and coastal missile systems in response, the ministry said.Taiwan's presidential office has criticised the drills, calling them a challenge to international norms.In a Tuesday morning statement on social media, President Lai Ching-te said the Chinese Communist Party's escalation of military pressure was \"not something that a responsible power should do\".\"We will act responsibly and not escalate conflict or stir up disputes,\" he said, adding that Taiwan's military and national security team would \"do their best to ensure the safety of the country\".The \"main audience\" for this week's drills \"really is the United States, Donald Trump and Japan more than the people of Taiwan,\" Susan Shirk, former US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, told the BBC's Newsday programme. \"It's an expression of resolve and anger\" about the US arm sales, which now include not only defensive weapons but also offensive equipment that could strike the Chinese mainland, Ms Shirk added.She also pointed out concerns in the US that President Trump \"is less committed to America's defence of Taiwan than previous presidents had been\".\"He's engaged in a kind of transactional policy in which he might be willing to reduce some of America's commitment to Taiwan, in exchange for other trade or economic benefits,\" she said.Alexander Neill, an adjunct fellow with the Pacific Forum, told the BBC that the ongoing exercise is \"designed to demonstrate an operational capability by the People's Liberation Army at sea and in the air\".Trump is \"not wrong\" about China's ramping of up such exercises over the past two decades, which is in line with the modernisation of its military, Mr Neill says.But, he adds, \"if [Trump] is suggesting that his rapport with Xi Jinping will have any bearing on Xi's approach to the Taiwan Strait, I think he's deluding himself.\"China has long vowed to \"reunify\" with Taiwan and has not ruled out the use of force to take it.It has in recent years ramped up pressure over Taipei with military drills and regular incursions into its waters and airspace. Taiwan in turn has plans to boost defence spending to modernise its armed forces.While Trump has downplayed Beijing's ongoing drills, his administration had recently announced a $11bn (£8.2bn) weapons package to Taiwan, which includes advanced rocket launchers, self-propelled howitzers and a variety of missiles.The US has formal ties with Beijing rather than Taiwan, and has walked a tight diplomatic rope for decades. But it remains a powerful ally of Taiwan and the island's biggest arms supplier.China hit back at the sale with sanctions on several US defence firms. Its foreign ministry also said that any attempt to \"contain China by using Taiwan will absolutely not succeed\".Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that China must \"firmly counter\" what he described as \"continuous provocations from pro-independence forces in Taiwan\" and the \"large-scale arms sales\" from the US.He added that the \"complete national reunification\" of Taiwan was \"a historical mission we must accomplish\".",

    "body": "15 hours agoKelly NgandMir Sabbir,Editor, BBC News BanglaKhaleda Zia, Bangladesh's first female prime minister and an arch-rival of ousted leader Sheikh Hasina, has died from a prolonged illness. She was 80 years old. Zia intended to run for parliament in February, when the country will vote for the first time since a popular revolution in late 2024 unseated Hasina.Thrust into the political limelight following the assassination of her husband, then-president Ziaur Rahman, she went on to become Bangladesh's first female PM in 1991. Her career, which included spells in prison and house arrest, was defined by a bitter feud with Hasina. She was acquitted of corruption and allowed to travel to London for treatment only after Hasina lost power. Physicians said on Monday that Zia's condition was \"extremely critical\". She was put on life support, but it was not possible to provide multiple treatments at the same time given her age and overall poor health, they added. \"Our favourite leader is no longer with us. She left us at 6am this morning,\" Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) announced on Facebook on Tuesday. When news of her death broke, crowds gathered outside Evercare Hospital in Dhaka where Zia had been admitted. As the wife of Bangladesh's former president Rahman, Zia was a reserved presence alongside her famous husband. When he was killed in a military coup in 1981, Zia entered politics and went on to lead the BNP in the country's first elections in 20 years.Known as an \"uncompromising leader\" after refusing to take part in a controversial election under military ruler General Hussain Muhammad Ershad in the 1980s, Zia broke through a male-dominated political landscape and transformed into one of Bangladesh's most formidable political leaders.Her first term was widely praised for efforts to improve women's education and social development, with her government bringing back parliamentary democracy by amending the constitution with bipartisan support.Her second term in 1996, which lasted only weeks, drew criticism for staging a one-sided election despite opposition demands for a neutral caretaker authority — a measure parliament approved before dissolving.Zia returned as prime minister in 2001, stepping down in October 2006 ahead of a general election. Her administration faced sharp criticism over allegations of corruption.Over the past 16 years, under the Awami League government, Zia became the most prominent symbol of resistance to Hasina's rule many saw as increasingly autocratic. She boycotted the 2014 election after her rival Hasina scrapped the caretaker government system — a provision meant to ensure neutrality during national polls. Later, Zia was convicted on corruption charges and jailed. She denied wrongdoing and said the charges were politically motivated.She was released in January 2025, soon after mass anti-government protests in Bangladesh toppled Hasina, forcing her into exile in India. She has since been convicted and sentenced to death for crimes against humanity over her crackdown of the protests.The BNP had said in November that Zia would campaign in the upcoming general elections. The party is eyeing a return to power, and if that happens, Zia's son Tarique Rahman is expected to become the country's new leader.Rahman, 60, had only returned to Bangladesh last week after 17 years in self-imposed exile in London.Zia had been in hospital for the past month, receiving treatment for kidney damage, heart disease and pneumonia, among other conditions.Despite being kept away from public life due to her health, Zia remained a figurehead for opposition forces.During her final days, interim leader Muhammad Yunus had called for the country to pray for Zia, calling her a \"source of utmost inspiration for the nation\".In a statement on Tuesday, Yunus offered his condolences for the passing of Zia, whom he described as a \"symbol of the democratic movement\".\"The nation has lost a great guardian... Her role in the struggle to establish democracy, a multi-party political culture, and the rights of the people in Bangladesh will be remembered forever,\" he said in a statement.Hasina's party, the Awami League, now banned in Bangladesh, issued a statement from Hasina on X paying tribute to Zia.Hasina, who is still in India, said in her statement that Zia's \"contributions to the nation were significant and will be remembered\", and her passing was a \"profound loss for Bangladesh's political life\". India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he is \"deeply saddened\" by Zia's passing and paid tribute to her contributions towards the development of Bangladesh, and its relations with India. \"We hope that her vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership,\" he wrote on X.Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called Zia \"a committed friend of Pakistan\", whose service to Bangladesh would leave a lasting legacy.Zia's family members, including Rahman, his wife and his daughter, were by her side in her last moments, BNP said.\"We pray for the forgiveness of her soul and request everyone to offer prayers for her departed soul,\" the party said in its statement on Tuesday.Additional reporting by Fan Wang",

    "body": "9 hours agoAmy WalkerEPAPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has denied allegations by Russia that Ukraine launched a drone attack on one of President Vladimir Putin's residences, and accused Moscow of trying to derail peace talks. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed Kyiv had launched an attack over Sunday night using 91 long-range unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on Putin's state residence in Russia's northwestern Novgorod region.Russia said it would now review its position in peace negotiations. It is not yet clear where Putin was at the time of the alleged attack.Zelensky dismissed the claim as \"typical Russian lies\", intended to give the Kremlin an excuse to continue attacks on Ukraine. He said that Russia had previously targeted government buildings in Kyiv, and warned that its latest claim could signal further strikes on Ukraine.\"Everyone must be vigilant now. Absolutely everyone. A strike may be launched on the capital,\" Zelensky told journalists on Monday, adding that Russia's comments were a \"threat\".He said Russia was \"looking for reasons\" to continue its attacks on Ukraine and that it saw progress towards a ceasefire as a \"failure\".Zelensky added on X: \"It is critical that the world doesn't stay silent now. We cannot allow Russia to undermine the work on achieving a lasting peace.\"In a statement shared on Telegram on Monday, Lavrov said all of the 91 drones he claimed were launched at Putin's residence were intercepted and destroyed by Russian air defence systems.He added that there were no reports of casualties or damage as a result of the attack.\"Given the final degeneration of the criminal Kyiv regime, which has switched to a policy of state terrorism, Russia's negotiating position will be revised,\" he said.But he added that Russia did not intend to exit the negotiating process with the US, Russian news agency Tass reported.On Tuesday, the Kremlin said it would not provide evidence for the alleged strike, with a spokesman telling journalists that Russia would now \"toughen\" its negotiating stance.Ukraine's foreign minister called on other countries to refrain from responding to Russia's \"false claims\".\"Almost a day passed, and Russia still hasn't provided any plausible evidence to its accusations of Ukraine's alleged 'attack on Putin's residence'. And they won't. Because there's none. No such attack happened,\" Andrii Sybiha said in a post on X.Moscow's claim comes after talks between the US and Ukraine in Florida on Sunday, where Presidents Trump and Zelensky discussed a revised peace plan to end the war.Following the meeting, Zelensky told Fox News on Monday that there was a \"possibility to finish this war\" in 2026.But he said Ukraine could not win the war without US support.\"My feelings of President Trump's sanctions and economical steps, shows that he's ready for very strong steps,\" Zelensky said. \"In this situation, the United States can move the situation to peace quicker.\"The Ukrainian president told Fox News there was no indication that Putin wanted peace and that he did not trust Putin.\"I don't trust Putin and he doesn't want success for Ukraine,\" Zelensky added.Zelensky said the US had offered Ukraine security guarantees for 15 years, and Trump said an agreement on this point was \"close to 95%\" done.Ukraine's leader described territorial issues and the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant as the last unresolved matters, and there was little sign of progress on the future of Ukraine's contested Donbas region - which Russia wants to seize in full.Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions are known collectively as Donbas.Russia has previously rejected key parts of the plan under discussion.The White House said on Monday that President Trump had \"concluded a positive call\" with Putin, following the US-Ukraine talks. Yuri Ushakov, a Kremlin foreign policy aide, told reporters on Monday that during the call, Putin had pointed out the alleged attack on his residence happened \"almost straight after what the US had considered to be a successful round of talks\".Ushakov said: \"The US president was shocked by this information, he was angry and said he couldn't believe such mad actions. It was stated that this will no doubt affect the US approach to working with Zelensky\".During a later press conference, Trump initially appeared to say he did not know about the alleged incident, but later told reporters that he was told about it by Putin and was \"very angry\" about it. Asked if the US had seen any evidence supporting Russia's claim, he responded: \"Well we'll find out. You're saying maybe the attack didn't take place - that's possible too, I guess. But President Putin told me this morning it did\". More on this story",

    "body": "6 hours agoKelly NgandJake Kwon,Seoul correspondentWatch: 'Trusting time' - NewJeans discusses court ruling in record label disputeChart-topping K-pop band NewJeans' record label, Ador, is suing one of the band's members in what is yet another twist in their bitter year-long feud.Hybe, the record label's parent company, confirmed to the BBC that it is suing Danielle Marsh, one of her family members, and ex-boss Min Hee-jin for $30m (£22m) in damages and as part of a contract break penalty.The band has been plunged into further turmoil as the return of Minji, another of its stars, remains uncertain, leaving the band with three members.Coming less than two months after reports that NewJeans would return to the label as a band of five, this news dashes fans' hopes of a comeback.Many took to social media with the slogan: \"NewJeans is five or nothing, while others questioned why Danielle was singled out.\"Does this make any sense??? NewJeans without Danielle isn't NewJeans. Do you think you can just erase a member this easily? Give us back Danielle,\" one wrote in an X post.\"It's not fair at all. Free NewJeans [all 5 members],\" another wrote on Instagram. \"All they wanted to do was to be [artists] and make their fans happy.\"NewJeans, which became the eighth biggest-selling act in the world a year after their debut in 2022, were seen as a game-changer by critics for their blend of 1990s R&B and sugar-coated pop melodies. Then came a dramatic fallout with the record label Ador in 2024, sparked by the controversial dismissal of the agency's former CEO Min Hee-jin, whom NewJeans regarded as a mentor.The move shook the K-pop world, setting off a battle between hugely successful and very young stars - they are between 17 and 21 years of age - and the South Korean entertainment giant, Hybe.NewJeans accused Ador of \"mistreatment\" and \"deliberate miscommunications and manipulation\", then announced they would leave the agency. Ador in turn launched a lawsuit blocking their departure, which it won in October this year. A district court ruled that NewJeans must honour their contract with the label which runs until 2029.A month later, local media reports indicated that all five members would return to the agency.Getty ImagesNewJeans have delivered remarkable success since they debuted in July 2022Then in a surprising turn, Ador issued a statement on Monday, saying it had terminated its contract with Danielle and would take legal action against a family member of hers and Min, who founded the label and created NewJeans before her dramatic departure. Both of them, Ador claims, \"bear significant responsibility\" for the fallout between the agency and the K-pop group. Monday's statement did not mention a lawsuit against Danielle, saying only that Ador had decided it was difficult to continue working with her, and told her they would be ending the contract.   Ador also claimed that NewJeans' members had been \"exposed to persistently distorted and biased information\" which led to \"significant misunderstandings\" about the label.That statement named two other NewJeans members: Hanni, who it said decided to remain with the label after \"extended conversations\" which included her family, and Minji, who is still in \"ongoing conversations\" with the agency.It's been a whirlwind for fans, especially since Ador initially announced in November that only two members, Hyein and Haerin, would return to the agency, sparking fears the group would split up.These fears were allayed when Hanni, Danielle and Minji said in a separate statement hours later that they too would return - but only for a short time, as it turns out. Getty ImagesAdor announced on Monday would terminate its contract with NewJeans member Danielle Marsh\"NewJeans is a very important group that changed the world of female K-pop acts. For the music listeners and fans, it has been the hope to see their return as a full five-member team. That's no longer possible,\" music critic Lim Hee-yun told the BBC, adding that this outcome would not \"make anyone happy\".Mr Lim believes Ador would be pressured to recruit new members into the group, especially if Minji also leaves the label.It is hard for three-member groups to find success in the K-pop industry, where fans pay close attention to the relationships and chemistry between members.Danielle's future as a musician is also uncertain.\"Not only will there be a large part of the public that see her negatively [because of this controversy], but the record labels will too... She might need to pursue being a solo act as an actor, model, or an influencer,\" Mr Lim said.Additional reporting by Leehyun Choi and Hosu Lee in Seoul",

    "body": "2 hours agoGeorge WrightandJacob Phillips & Nicky Schiller,London St Pancras InternationalKelly North and Bethany Massey-Chase tell the BBC how they've had to re-book their Eurostar service to ParisSome Eurostar services have resumed after all trains from London to Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels were cancelled due to a power outage in the Channel Tunnel.Trains that have not been cancelled will be subject to \"severe delays and possible last-minute cancellations\" following the tunnel's partial reopening, and passengers are advised to postpone their travel to a different date, Eurostar said. LeShuttle services - which carries road vehicles and passengers through the tunnel between Folkestone and Calais - have also resumed. Earlier a problem with the overhead power supply and a broken down LeShuttle train blocked all routes, causing travel chaos for thousands trying to get away.The rail operator suspended services until further notice. By midday on Tuesday, at least a dozen Eurostar services between the UK, France, Belgium and the Netherlands had been cancelled.The rail operator apologised and said passengers could rearrange their plans free of charge or can cancel their booking and get a refund or an e-voucher.Passengers told the BBC how they had been left stranded and looking for alternative routes to get to their destination. Two American tourists spent hundreds of pounds to reach Paris on Wednesday after their Eurostar service was cancelled from London St Pancras International.Haley Adams, 38, and Hannah Hagar, 35, paid $580 (£430) for flights to the French capital to celebrate Hannah's 36th birthday there.The pair had their Eurostar tickets refunded but said they will have to pay for an extra night at a hotel in London and cannot get a refund from the hotel they were going to stay at in Paris tonight.\"There's been a lot of queuing,\" Adams said. \"We have been here for five hours.\"Haley Adams and Hannah Hagar spent hundreds on alternative travel plansA family from Mexico said their trip of a lifetime has been cast into doubt as their Eurostar service was cancelled.Monserrat Hernandes, her brother John Paul and mother Olga were among dozens of people looking frantically at their phones near the Eurostar departure area at St Pancras.The family got on the Eurostar just after 08:00 GMT but after their train left for Paris it had to return due to the incident.\"They say nothing is travelling today… there's no hope for leaving tomorrow,\" she said.They are now searching for a flight or a ferry to make it to Paris.\"It's like an American movie,\" she added. \"Hopefully I find the love of my life.\"This Mexican family were trying to get to Paris for New Year's EveIn France, Ben Clark, from Bedfordshire, said he had been stuck on-board Le Shuttle in Calais with his wife and three daughters for hours.\"The first two-and-a-half hours weren't too bad but the girls have got restless in the last half an hour so we've let them run around the boarding carriage to burn off some energy,\" he said.\"Some people are getting angry but there's nothing that can be done, others are sleeping in their cars. We have used up our snacks and now have no plan B or C.\"BBC / Nicky SchillerServices between London and France, Belgium and the Netherlands have been hitNational Rail has advised passengers not to come to London St Pancras International if their Eurostar train is cancelled, while the Department for Transport said disruption is \"likely for the remainder of the day\" while faulty overhead cables are repaired. Currently only one of two main tunnels in the Channel Tunnel is available for trains to run on, Eurostar said in a statement to the BBC.Eurostar's services resumed with the 15:04 train from London to Brussels departing after 16:00. As of 18:00, only a few services to Paris Gare du Nord and Brussels were scheduled to depart London St Pancras International this evening. PA MediaCars and coaches were queued up outside the Channel Tunnel terminal in FolkestoneThe broken down LeShuttle train was also moved out of the Channel Tunnel. The operator said none of its passengers were stranded inside the tunnel after the power failure caused its closure. LeShuttle has apologised and warned of delays at check-in and departures. The LeShuttle service \"resumed very gradually on one track\" shortly before 15:00 local time (14:00 GMT), the EuroTunnel Press Office said.\"Service is operating alternately in both directions with significant delays,\" it said, adding that \"additional shuttles will be added in the evening and until tomorrow morning\". Traffic has also eased on the M20 after cars hoping to cross the Channel Tunnel caused traffic jams near the LeShuttle Terminal in Folkestone. ",

    "body": "20 hours agoOlga IvshinaBBC News RussianANDREY BORODULIN/AFP via Getty ImagesBBC News Russian counts Moscow's war losses using official reports, newspapers, social media, and new memorials and gravesOver the past 10 months, Russian losses in the war with Ukraine have been growing faster than any time since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, BBC analysis suggests.As peace efforts intensified in 2025 under pressure from US President Donald Trump's administration, 40% more obituaries of soldiers were published in Russian sources compared with the previous year.Overall, the BBC has confirmed the names of almost 160,000 people killed fighting on Russia's side in Ukraine. BBC News Russian has been counting Russian war losses together with independent outlet Mediazona and a group of volunteers since February 2022. We keep a list of named individuals whose deaths we were able to confirm using official reports, newspapers, social media, and new memorials and graves.The real death toll is believed to be much higher, and military experts we have consulted believe our analysis of cemeteries, war memorials and obituaries might represent 45-65% of the total. That would put the number of Russian deaths at between 243,000 and 352,000.The number of obituaries for any given period is a preliminary estimate of the confirmed losses, as some need additional verification and will eventually be discarded. But it can indicate how the intensity of fighting is changing over time.2025 starts with a relatively low number of published obituaries in January, compared with the previous months. Then the number rises in February, when  Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin talked directly for the first time about ending the war in Ukraine.The next peak in August coincides with the two presidents meeting each other in Alaska, a diplomatic coup for Putin that was widely seen as an end to his international isolation.In October, when a planned second Russia-US summit was eventually shelved, and then in November, when the US presented a 28-point peace proposal, an average of 322 obituaries were published per day - twice the average in 2024.It is difficult to put increased Russian losses down to any one factor, but the Kremlin sees territorial gains as a way of influencing negotiations with the US in its favour: Putin aide Yuri Ushakov stressed recently that \"recent successes\" had had a positive impact.Murat Mukashev was among those who gambled on a quick peace deal, and it cost him his life.Mukashev (inset) signed up for the army after he was given a 10-year jail termMukashev was an activist who had never supported Putin's policies. Over the years, he had taken part in demonstrations against police violence and torture, and joined rallies for LGBT rights and the release of Alexei Navalny, the Kremlin's main opponent who died in prison in 2024.He had repeatedly condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine on social media from 2022. Then, in early 2024, Mukashev was detained near his home in Moscow and charged with large-scale drug dealing.While his case was being tried he was offered a contract with the defence ministry, according to his friends and family. They saw the heavy charges levelled against him as a typical ploy to get people to sign up. A 2024 law allows the accused a way out of a criminal conviction if they join up - an attractive option in a country with an acquittal rate of less than 1%.Mukashev refused the offer, and the court sentenced him to 10 years in a high-security penal colony.Murat MukashevMukashev was never a Putin supporter and had protested against the war and police violenceIn prison in November 2024, he changed his mind. Friends said he was encouraged by Trump's promises to end the war quickly and decided he needed to sign up as soon as possible to secure his release before a peace deal was reached.\"He saw this as a chance to be released instead of being imprisoned for 10 years of strict regime,\" reads a statement from his support group.There was no explanation of how he reconciled taking part in the war with his reluctance to kill.On June 11 2025, Mukashev died fighting as part of an assault squad in the Kharkiv region of north-eastern Ukraine.Like him, the majority of Russians killed at the front in 2025 had nothing to do with the military at the start of the full-scale war, BBC figures show.But since the bloody battle for the city of Avdiivka in October 2023, there has been a steady increase in casualties among so-called \"volunteers\" - those who have voluntarily signed a contract since the start of the invasion.They now appear to form the majority of Russia's new recruits, as opposed to professional soldiers who joined the army before the invasion or those mobilised  for military service afterwards. A year ago 15% of Russian military deaths were volunteers, but in 2025 it was one in three.ReutersFile photo of Russian recruits in Rostov regionLocal governments, under pressure to maintain a constant flow of new recruits, advertise hefty pay-outs, meet people who have large debts and campaign in universities and colleges. This means that the Kremlin has been able to compensate for heavy losses at the front while avoiding the politically risky move of a large-scale mandatory mobilisation.By October, 336,000 people had signed up for the military this year, according to National Security Council deputy chief Dmitry Medvedev - well over 30,000 a month.Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte has since said that 25,000 Russian soldiers are being killed every month. If both are right, Russia is still recruiting more soldiers than it is losing.Based on obituaries and relatives' accounts, most of those who signed up to fight did so voluntarily; but there are reports of pressure and coercion, especially on regular conscripts and those charged with criminal offences.Some recruits mistakenly believe that after they have signed up for a year they can return to their old life with money in their pockets. A new recruit can earn up to 10m roubles (£95,000; $128,000) in a year. In reality all contracts signed with the defence ministry since September 2022 are automatically renewed until the war is over.According to Nato, the total number of Russian dead and wounded in the war is 1.1 million, and one official has estimated there have been 250,000 fatalities. This is in line with the BBC's calculations, although our list does not include those killed serving in the militia of two occupied regions in eastern Ukraine, which we estimate to be between 21,000 and 23,500 fighters.Ukraine has also sustained heavy losses. Last February, President Volodymyr Zelensky put the number of battlefield deaths at 46,000 and 380,000 others wounded. Tens of thousands more were either missing in action or held captive, he added. Based on other estimates and cross-referencing data, we believe the number of Ukrainians killed by now is as high as 140,000.",

    "body": "19 hours agoVictoria Gill, Kate Stephens and Gwyndaf Hughes,BBC News science teamandAhmed Nour,BBC News ArabicGetty ImagesGreat white sharks in the Mediterranean Sea are in danger of disappearing, with illegal fishing contributing to their decline.This is according to research by US scientists, working in partnership with UK  charity Blue Marine Foundation. They say some of the most threatened species - including great white sharks - are being sold in North African fish markets.Great whites are one of more than 20 Mediterranean shark species protected under international law, meaning it is illegal to fish for them or to sell them.By monitoring fishing ports on the Mediterranean coast of North Africa, however, researchers discovered that at least 40 great white sharks have been killed there in 2025 alone.James Glancy/Blue MarineConservationists and scientists say they have seen protected species for sale in fish markets in North Africa The BBC has also found, and independently verified, footage from social media of protected sharks being brought dead into North African ports.One video showed a large great white being hauled ashore from a fishing boat in Algeria. Another, filmed in Tunisia, shows heads and fins of what appears to be a short-finned mako shark, which is also a threatened and protected species, being prepared for sale.Last shark stronghold James Glancy/Martin StalkerThe researchers worked from a vessel in the Strait of SicilyLead researcher, Dr Francesco Ferretti from the US university Virginia Tech, explained that many shark populations -  white sharks in particular - had declined dramatically in the Mediterranean in recent decades.\"No other stretch of water is fished like the Mediterranean Sea,\" he said, speaking to  the BBC News science team while working on a research vessel off the coast of Sicily in late 2025. \"The impact of industrial fishing has been intensifying... and it's plausible that they will go extinct in the near future.\"The Mediterranean white shark population is now classified as Critically Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.In their latest attempt to find and study the predators, Dr Ferretti and his team worked in the Strait of Sicily - an area between Sicily and North Africa that has been identified as a \"last stronghold\" in the Mediterranean for several threatened shark species.One key aim of their mission was to fit a satellite tracking tag onto a white shark - something that has never been done in the Mediterranean Sea.To attempt this, the researchers brought more than three tonnes of fish bait - a shipping container packed with frozen mackerel and tuna scraps, as well as 500 litres of tuna oil to create a \"fat slick\" that many sharks would be able to smell from hundreds of metres away. Despite working for two weeks - baiting the ocean, taking samples of seawater to search for shark DNA and using underwater cameras - the researchers did not manage to find any animals to tag.They captured only a brief glimpse of one blue shark on their submarine cameras.\"It's disheartening,\" Dr Ferretti told us. \"It just shows how degraded this ecosystem is.\"While the team was searching for surviving sharks, they also received reports that a juvenile great white had been caught and killed in a North African fishery -  just 20 nautical miles from where they were working.It is not clear whether that animal was accidentally caught in fishing gear, or if it was targeted. Dr Ferretti and his team, though, estimate that more than 40 great white sharks have been caught around that coast. \"This is a lot for a critically endangered population,\" he said. Sharks for saleJames Glancy/Blue MarineJames Glancy from Blue Marine visited fish markets in Tunisia in 2023 and discovered protected sharks being sold  The researchers, with their colleagues in North Africa are monitoring several fishing ports in the region. Our work, with the BBC Forensics team, also shows that protected sharks are caught, landed and offered for sale in countries including Tunisia and Algeria.We found footage - posted on social media - of a great white being landed in a fishing port in Algeria and another large shark that appears to be a protected short-finned mako, being prepared for sale on a trolly in a fish market in Tunisia.The rules that protect sharks are complicated. Currently, 24 threatened species have international legal protection – including mako, angel, threshers and hammerheads. The EU and 23 nations around the Mediterranean have signed an agreement, which states that those species cannot be \"retained on board, transhipped, landed, transferred, stored, sold or displayed or offered for sale\". The international agreement states \"they must be released unharmed and alive [where] possible\". Those rules do not tackle accidental bycatch and enforcement is variable from country to country.Virginia Tech/Blue MarineThe researchers used baited underwater cameras to search the area for sharks James Glancy from Blue Marine told BBC News that his own investigation found multiple white sharks on sale in Tunisian fishing markets. But, he said, there was a paradoxical element of hope in the fact that white sharks were turning up for sale.\"It shows that there is wildlife left,\" he told BBC News. \"And if we can preserve this, there is a chance of recovery.\" What can be done? In poorer communities in North Africa, fishers who catch sharks might face the choice of whether to feed their family, or return a threatened species to the ocean.Sara Almabruk from the Libyan Marine Biology Society says that most of the catches happening in North African waters are accidental, but adds: \"Why would they throw sharks back into the sea when they need food for their children?\"If you support them and train them in more sustainable fishing, they will not catch white sharks – or any sharks.\"James Glancy from Blue Marine added that if countries around the Mediterranean worked together, \"there is hope. \"But, he added, \"we've got to act very quickly\".",

    "body": "16 hours agoPaulin KolaEPA/ShutterstockJacques and Jessica Moretti, French owners of Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, say they are co-operating with the investigationA judge in Switzerland has ordered that one of the two co-owners of the ski resort bar where 40 people died in a fire on New Year's Eve be kept in detention for 90 days.Swiss prosecutors have argued that Jacques Moretti, a French national, is a potential flight risk. He and his wife Jessica, who is also French, are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.The blaze at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana also left 116 people injured. Many of the victims were aged under 20.The fire is believed to have been started by sparklers in champagne bottles raised too close to the ceiling during celebrations.Authorities acknowledged last week that the bar in the popular ski resort had not undergone safety checks for five years.Watch: Co-owner of Swiss ski bar apologises to victimsJacques Moretti was first detained on Friday for an initial period of 48 hours. On Monday, a judge at what is known as a court of coercive measures ruled that he should be kept in custody for three months - a period that can be renewed under Swiss law.It is known as provisional - or preventive - detention and is meant to last until a case goes to court. In this instance, the court said the measure may be lifted upon payment of bail, whose sum would be set later.The couple were placed under criminal investigation days after the devastating fire. Moretti's wife, Jessica, who is under house arrest, told reporters on Friday that she was sorry about the \"unthinkable tragedy\".The prosecutors have said they believe the fire started when people celebrating the New Year raised champagne bottles with sparklers attached, setting light to sound-insulating foam on the ceiling of the basement bar.EPA/ShutterstockPeople across Switzerland observed a minute's silence on FridayThe news that the bar had not been inspected for five years has shocked families of the victims.Venues like Le Constellation should have been checked annually, but Crans-Montana Mayor Nicolas Feraud said on Tuesday he could not explain why this had not been done for so long at that bar.\"We regret that - we owe it to the families and we will accept the responsibility,\" he said.He added that sparklers would be banned in local venues.Most of the victims of the fire were young - eight were under the age of 16.Many of the injured have severe burns. Eighty remain in hospitals in Switzerland and other European countries.",

    "body": "The death toll in a collapsed landfill in the central Philippines has risen to 11, authorities said. The landslide occurred at the Binaliw landfill in Cebu City last week while more than 100 workers were on site, officials said. Rescuers have so far pulled 12 injured people out of the debris, but more than 20 people still remain missing. One local fire official had earlier told AFP that was unlikely for \"people to still be alive\" three days after \"tons of debris collapsed over them\".But \"signs of life\" were detected in the debris during a search on Monday, Cebu City Mayor Nestor Archival told GMA News in an interview, adding that officials remain in \"rescue mode\".The incident has sparked calls for investigation into the cause of the collapse, as well as a review of the country's waste management system.Environment authorities have since ordered Prime Integrated Waste Solutions, Inc., the landfill's operator, to suspend its activities at the site.The company would have to \"submit a compliance plan within 90 days\", the local Department of Environment and Natural Resources said in a statement on Monday.The department also said it would conduct an investigation into the cause of the collapse and hold to account the responsible parties.Lawmakers have called for reviews of the country's waste management system and working conditions of waste workers.\"This should have never happened,\" Senator Imee Marcos, who has requested an investigation into the Binaliw landfill's operations, said on Monday. \"We have seen similar tragedies before, yet the same dangers persist.\"\"The lives lost in Cebu demand clear answers and real reforms.\"Bienvinido Ranido, who lives near the landfill and whose wife worked there, told Reuters that he saw people fleeing from the site last week, saying the \"garbage exploded\".\"I quickly took my motorcycle and rushed to the landfill. When I got there, I saw the collapsed building and it was buried by the garbage. I just screamed,\" he said. Rescuers retrieved his wife's body the next day.The Binaliw landfill is located on a piece of land measuring 20 hectares (49 acres) - three hectares of which are used for the landfill, Cebu newspaper The Freeman reported, citing the landfill's operator.While authorities are still looking into the cause of the landslide, a preliminary report from the local Mines and Geosciences Bureau points to continuous rainfall in recent weeks, which made the rubbish heavier, as well as other engineering factors, local media reported.Landfills are common in major Philippine cities like Cebu, which is the trading centre and transportation gateway of the Visayas, the archipelago nation's central islands.",

    "body": "8 hours agoSakshi VenkatramanandBernd Debusmann Jr,White House ReporterVenezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado will meet President Donald Trump on Thursday,  the White House has confirmed.The visit comes just weeks after Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was seized in Caracas by US forces. But Trump declined to endorse Machado, whose movement claimed victory in 2024's widely contested elections, as its new leader. The US instead backed Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's former vice-president.Machado said last week she hoped to thank Trump personally for the action against Maduro and would like to give the Nobel Prize to him. Trump called it  \"a great honour\", but the Nobel Committee later clarified that it was not transferable.Earlier, Trump had expressed displeasure over Machado's decision to accept the  Nobel Peace Prize, an honour the president has long coveted.Asked on Friday whether receiving Machado's prize might change his view of her role in Venezuela, the president said: \"She might be involved in some aspect of it.\"\"I will have to speak to her. I think it's very nice that she wants to come in. And that's what I understand the reason is,\" he said.Earlier this month, after Maduro's ouster, Trump had said Machado \"doesn't have the support within, or the respect within, the country\". \"She's a very nice woman, but she doesn't have the respect,\" he said.The US has so far backed Delcy Rodríguez  as Venezuela's interim president.Trump describes Rodríguez as an \"ally\", and she has not been charged by US officials with any crimes.\"Delcy Rodríguez and her team have been very cooperative with the United States,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday. But Machado has maintained that her coalition should \"absolutely\" be in charge of the country.Machado has said nobody trusted Rodríguez, telling CBS that the interim leader was \"one of the main architects... of repression for innocent people\" in the South American country.\"Everybody in Venezuela and abroad knows perfectly who she is and the role she has played,\" Machado said.The former legislator, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year, described US military action in Venezuela as \"a major step towards restoring prosperity and rule of law and democracy in Venezuela\".Rodríguez has rebuffed claims by Trump that the US was in charge of Venezuela.\"The Venezuelan government rules our country, and no-one else does,\" she said in a televised speech. \"There is no external agent governing Venezuela.\"",

    "body": "Joshua Cavallo - the first man to come out as gay while playing top-tier football - has alleged he was pushed out of his former club due to \"internal homophobia\".Cavallo, who recently joined Stamford AFC after leaving Adelaide United in May last year, made global headlines in 2021 when he came out with the support of his Australian club and teammates.In an Instagram post on Tuesday, Cavallo alleged that the Adelaide United officials had afterwards sidelined him due to his sexuality, something a spokesperson for the club said it \"categorically rejects\".\"All on-field decisions relating to team selection are made solely on footballing grounds,\" the club's statement read.In the Instagram post, Cavallo wrote that it had taken him a while to \"digest how my time at Adelaide United ended\" but said he was speaking out because fans deserve honesty.\"It's hard to swallow when I realised my own club was homophobic. I was angry because people thought I was sidelined based on injuries, when in reality, it was internal homophobia that kept me on the bench.\"A change in management meant \"politics\" kept him off the pitch and limited his career opportunities, Cavallo said, also alleging a photo of him and his partner was mocked by his teammates in a group chat.\"For the first time, I actually questioned if I should have kept my sexuality a secret.\"A spokesperson for Adelaide United - which is due to take part in its fourth Pride Cup match on Saturday - said it was \"extremely disappointed by the claims made\".\"Adelaide United has always been committed to fostering an inclusive environment for players, staff and supporters, and we remain proud of our ongoing work to promote inclusion across football.\"Cavallo has previously spoken about receiving death threats on a near daily basis after his decision to publicly come out, but has said that his only regret is not coming out sooner.His 2021 revelation inspired Jake Daniels, who in 2022, at the age of 17, became the first British professional male footballer to come out in more than 30 years.",

    "body": "Ai, a female chimpanzee famous for her cognitive skills has died at 49, according to the Japanese institute where she lived. The Kyoto University's Center for the Evolutionary Origins of Human Behavior said Ai died on 9 January of old age and organ failure and that she was surrounded by staff when she died. Ai was born in western Africa and arrived at the Japanese institute in 1977. There, she became the namesake of the Ai Project, a research programme into the \"chimpanzee mind\".Among the institute's noteable findings were the fact that Ai was able to use numbers and identify colours. Researchers gave Ai a special keyboard linked to a computer when she was 18 months, a set-up that they used to study her memory and learning. At five years old, Ai \"mastered numerical naming from one to six and was able to name the number, colour and object of 300 types of samples\", according to a 1985 scientific paper by Tetsuro Matsuzawa, the primatologist behind the Ai Project.When she was not participating in cognitive tests, Ai was known to enjoy drawing and painting. Like other chimpanzees at the centre, Ai would scrawl marker pens over blank paper without having to be motivated by food rewards.Japanese media outlet Kyodo news reported that she once escaped with another primate - using a key to unlock her cage. In 2000 she gave birth to a son, Ayumu, who is also known for his remarkable memory.  In 2017 - the 40th anniversary of the Ai Project - a scarf made from one of Ai's paintings was gifted to renowned primatologist Dame Jane Goodall.",

    "body": "15 hours agoAdam EastonBBC News Warsaw correspondentReutersZbigniew Ziobro says he is a victim of political persecutionHungary has granted political asylum to Poland's former Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro who is facing charges of embezzlement.Ziobro is facing 26 charges related to embezzling money from a fund meant to be spent on crime victims and rehabilitating criminals.Instead, he is accused of authorising the purchase of spyware that was allegedly used to hack political opponents' phones. He says he is a victim of political persecution.Granting asylum to a citizen of a fellow EU member state goes against the spirit of EU standards.But in the case of Hungary it is neither new nor surprising.Ziobro is the second politician of the former Law and Justice-led government to be granted this status - last year it was his former deputy Marcin Romanowski who fled to Budapest to seek protection.Both are accused of corruption and misusing their power - most notably by using the money of the state-controlled Justice Fund which was under their oversight in order to fund their party and its cronies.Ziobro was justice minister between 2015 and 2023 under the previous right-wing PiS-led government, which is politically aligned to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.If found guilty he could face up to 25 years in prison.Writing on X, Ziobro said: \"I have decided to accept the asylum granted to me by the government of Hungary due to the political persecution in Poland.\"\"I have chosen to fight against political banditry and lawlessness. I stand in opposition to a creeping dictatorship,\" Ziobro added, accusing Prime Minister Donald Tusk of waging a \"vendetta\" against him.Ziobro is accused of authorising a 25m zloty ($7m; £5.15m) purchase of Israeli-made Pegasus spyware, which Poland's current coalition government and a European Parliament investigative team found was used to secretly hack the phones of political opponents.Current Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said his phone was hacked and Tusk said his wife's and daughter's phones were also hacked.Ziobro is also accused of awarding Justice Fund grants to fire stations and women's associations without proper competition to bolster support for the government.As minister of justice from 2015 to 2023, Ziobro was the author of judiciary reforms which provoked a major conflict with Brussels. The issue led to a freeze of EU money for Poland as well as to verdicts of the European Court of Justice, which deemed them as violating fundamental EU rules and standards including the principle of judicial independence. Orban, who faced similar criticism, and the PiS rejected and ignored those rulings, saying they violated Poland's sovereignty and constituted an overreach of Brussels's powers. ",

    "body": "About 550,000 accounts were blocked by Meta during the first days of Australia's landmark social media ban for kids.In December, a new law began requiring that the world's most popular social media sites - including Instagram and Facebook - stop Australians aged under 16 from having accounts on their platforms.The ban, which is being watched closely around the world, was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful content and algorithms.Companies including Meta have said they agree more is needed to keep young people safe online. However they continue to argue for other measures, with some experts raising similar concerns.\"We call on the Australian government to engage with industry constructively to find a better way forward, such as incentivising all of industry to raise the standard in providing safe, privacy-preserving, age appropriate experiences online, instead of blanket bans,\" Meta said in a blog update.The company said it blocked 330,639 accounts on Instagram, 173,497 on Facebook, and 39,916 on Threads during it's first week of compliance with the new law.They again put the argument that age verification should happen at an app store level - something they suggested lowers the burden of compliance on both regulators and the apps themselves - and that exemptions for parental approval should be created.\"This is the only way to guarantee consistent, industry-wide protections for young people, no matter which apps they use, and to avoid the whack-a-mole effect of catching up with new apps that teens will migrate to in order to circumvent the social media ban law.\"Various governments, from the US state of Florida to the European Union, have been experimenting with limiting children's use of social media. But, along with a higher age limit of 16, Australia is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest.The policy is wildly popular with parents and envied by world leader, with the Tories this week pledging to follow suit if they win power at the next election, due before 2029.However some experts have raised concerns that Australian kids can circumvent the ban with relative ease - either by tricking the technology that's performing the age checks, or by finding other, potentially less safe, places on the net to gather.And backed by some mental health advocates, many children have argued it robs young people of connection - particularly those from LGBTQ+, neurodivergent or rural communities - and will leave them less equipped to tackle the realities of life on the web.",

    "body": "2 days agoGabriela PomeroyandUsman Zahid,in IslamabadA newly married couple were killed when a gas cylinder exploded at a house in Islamabad where they were sleeping after their wedding party, police have said. A further six people - including wedding guests and family members - who were staying there also died in the blast. More than a dozen people were injured. The explosion took place at 07:00 local time (02:00 GMT) on Sunday, causing the roof to collapse. Parts of the walls were blown away, leaving piles of bricks, large concrete slabs and furniture strewn across the floor. Injured people were trapped under the rubble and had to be carried out on stretchers by rescue workers. Emergency workers said the blast happened due to gas leakage, which filled the room and then exploded. Three neighbouring houses were also damaged.  The chairman of Pakistan's Senate, Yusuf Raza Gilani, called it \"a heart-wrenching incident that turned celebrations into mourning\".Hanif Masih, the father of the groom, said his son had been married the previous day, and the newlywed couple, along with family members and guests, were sleeping in the house at the time of the explosion. Masih said everyone went to bed around 03:00 local time on Sunday (22:00 GMT on Saturday), and woke up to the devastation.Along with his son, his daughter-in-law, wife and sister-in-law were all killed.Police said they had cordoned off the area and were investigating the circumstances of the blast. Forensic officers in white suits were sent to comb through the debris. Deputy police commissioner Sahibzada Yousaf told local media that sniffer dogs and advanced technology were used to ensure everyone was rescued from the rubble.Many Pakistani households use liquefied petroleum gas cylinders for fuel and cooking. Gas cyclinders have been linked to other deadly accidents caused by gas leaks. Gilani expressed concern about the explosion and said more needed to be done to curb the \"unsafe use of gas cylinders\". \"Such incidents demand that relevant departments fulfil their responsibilities seriously and ensure safety measures,\" he said in a statement reported by local media.",

    "body": "5 hours agoDanielle KayeBusiness reporterUS President Donald Trump on Monday said he had imposed a 25% tariff on goods from countries with commercial ties to Iran, a move that could put pressure on Tehran as anti-government protests enter a third week.Trump said on social media that the tariff was \"effective immediately\", without offering details of what constituted \"doing business\" with Iran.China is Iran's largest trading partners, followed by Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and India.The new tariff comes after Trump threatened to intervene militarily if Tehran killed protesters. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that military options including air strikes were still \"on the table\".\"Any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday.\"This Order is final and conclusive,\" he added.The White House did not share additional information about the tariffs, including which countries' imports will be hit hardest.Anger over the plummeting value of the Iranian currency, the rial, sparked protests in late December, which have grown into a crisis of legitimacy for Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA) says it has verified the deaths of nearly 500 protesters and 48 security personnel in Iran, while sources tell the BBC the death toll could be much higher. Thousands more have reportedly been arrested.However, an internet blackout since Thursday evening has made it difficult to obtain and verify information. The BBC and most other international news organisations are unable to report from inside Iran.Trump has threatened to intervene, and said on Sunday that Iranian officials had called him \"to negotiate\" - but added \"we may have to act before a meeting\".International sanctions over Iran's nuclear programme have had a severe impact on the country's economy, which has also been weakened by government mismanagement and corruption.On 28 December shopkeepers took to the streets of Tehran to express their anger at another sharp fall in the value of the rial against the US dollar on the open market.Iran's currency has sunk to a record low over the past year while inflation has soared to more than 40%, resulting in sharp price rises for everyday items like cooking oil and meat.

    "body": "2 days agoGabriela PomeroyEPAOne person has died and 300 properties have been destroyed in bushfires that have torn across south-east Australia. The fires have raged in dozens of locations across the country for several days, mostly in the state of Victoria, but also in New South Wales, burning through land almost twice the size of Greater London.A state of emergency has been declared in Victoria as thousands of firefighters and more than 70 aircraft battle the blaze. Residents in more than a dozen communities have been advised to leave their homes.Authorities fear the fires, which are being fuelled by very hot, dry and windy conditions, could burn for several weeks.AAP/Michael Currie via REUTERSA forest burns in Longwood, Victoria, Australia on 9 January Victoria's Premier Jacinta Allan said 30 active fires were burning across the state, 10 of which were of particular concern. She said 350,000 hectares had been burnt across the state as of 08:00 local time on Sunday (23:00 GMT on Saturday). \"We will see fires continue for some time across the state and that is why we are not through the worst of this by a long way,\" she told Australian media. \"There are fires that are continuing right now that are threatening homes and property.\"Human remains were found in the village of Gobur, near the town of Longwood, some 110km (70 sq miles) north of the state capital Melbourne, police said. The victim has not yet been identified.Allan praised the emergency workers who worked to retrieve the body. \"This is difficult and confronting work, and it takes a heavy toll.\"\"The Gobur community is grieving,\" she said. Bushfire smoke is impacting air quality in many areas across Victoria, including metropolitan Melbourne. Authorities said the fires were the worst to hit the south-east of Australia since the 2019-2020 blazes that destroyed an area the size of Turkey and killed 33 people. Hundreds more are believed to have died due to the effects of the smoke which choked towns and cities that summer.ReutersFirefighter Tyrone Rice said losing his own home in the fire in Harcourt was \"a kick in the guts\"One of the worst-affected places is the small town of Harcourt in the central highlands of Victoria, where firefighter Tyrone Rice lost his own home in the blaze. He was out fighting one of the bushfires when he learned it was on fire. He told Australian media it was \"like a kick in the guts, but I'm not the first person to go through it, and I won't be the last\".The destruction in Harcourt was \"gut-wrenching\", local fire captain Andrew Wilson said. A reporter for Australia's 9 News, Jack Ward, told the BBC World Service he had visited the damage in several towns across eastern Australia. What he saw was \"catastrophic\", he said, and in many places, \"all that's left of these houses is a tin roof lying on the ground\".While it is hard to link individual wildfires to climate change as how humans manage the land can play a factor, scientists say climate change is making the hot, dry weather conditions conducive to bush fires more common.",

    "body": "Thousands of tourists have been stranded in Finland's Lapland as a severe cold spell has grounded flights out of one of its airports.Departures from Lapland's Kittila airport that would have ferried winter travellers back to places like London, Bristol, Manchester, Paris and Amsterdam were all cancelled on Sunday as temperatures did not go above -35C on Sunday.The issue is expected to continue on Monday as a low of -39C is forecast by Finland's meteorological agency. The first flight out of Kittila has already been cancelled.The extreme cold makes it hard to de-ice planes, while maintenance and refuelling equipment on the ground can freeze.Airport operator Finavia told public broadcaster Yle that moisture in the air was making the situation worse as it was creating slippery frost.While Lapland - which spans northern Norway, Sweden and Finland - is known for the cold and snow, Finnish Lapland usually has a winter average temperature of -14C, with occasional dips to -30C, according to the nation's tourism board.Kittila airport predominantly serves people wishing to travel to nearby ski resorts and to see the Northern Lights, while Rovaniemi airport further south is the \"official\" destination for visitors to Santa Claus's folkloric home.On Monday, the first local flight set to arrive in Kittila was cancelled, with international flights delayed.The cold weather has also made the roads particularly hazardous, with Fintraffic warning of icy conditions in the region.A bus full of Ukrainian passengers drove into a ditch on Sunday morning, Yle reported, citing local police. It said no serious injuries were reported.The unusual cold in Lapland comes as a storm passing over northern Europe has brought wintry conditions and travel disruption to the UK, France and Germany.A man was killed after a tree fell on his caravan in England, while around 100,000 homes were without power in France on Saturday.",

    "body": "2 days agoChristal HayesLos AngelesBob Weir, the guitarist who co-founded the Grateful Dead, has died aged 78.Weir, a cornerstone of the California psychedelic rock group and many of its offshoots, passed away after a battle with cancer and lung issues, according to a post on his Instagram.\"There is no final curtain here, not really. Only the sense of someone setting off again,\" the post says, noting his hopes that his legacy and lengthy catalogue will live on.The post says he \"transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones\".\"He often spoke of a three-hundred-year legacy, determined to ensure the songbook would endure long after him,\" the post continues. \"May that dream live on through future generations of Dead Heads.\"With a career spanning more than 60 years, Weir's big break was in 1965 with the founding of the Grateful Dead. Within a few years, they became a force within San Francisco's characteristic counterculture.Quickly their style began shaping rock music - blending psychedelia and 1960s drug culture with musical tones that fused folk and Americana. They are considered one of the pioneers of jam bands.The group was inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and received a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Grammy's in 2007.'A large amount of weirdness': The long, strange success of the Grateful DeadThe group officially halted in 1995 with the death of fellow co-founder Jerry Garcia.But Weir was involved in various spin-offs, including Dead & Company, which had a residency at the Las Vegas Sphere in 2024 and 2025.Weir was diagnosed with cancer in July and even while being treated, he continued to perform, according to the post on his page.\"Those performances, emotional, soulful, and full of light, were not farewells, but gifts,\" the post says. \"Another act of resilience. An artist choosing, even then, to keep going by his own design.\"He beat cancer before his death, the posts adds. It's unclear what type of cancer he had been diagnosed with.His family, including wife Natascha and children Shala and Chloe, asked for privacy but said they appreciated the \"outpouring of love, support, and remembrance\".Tributes started to pour in late on Saturday from fellow musicians. Even the Empire State Building in New York City honoured the rock legend by shining with tie-dye colours to memorise him.Slash, guitarist of Guns N' Roses, posted a photo of Weir playing on stage. He wrote \"RIP\" with a broken-heart emoji.Former Eagles guitarist Don Felder posted a lengthy tribute.\"I first saw Bob at Woodstock with the Grateful Dead and was blown away by that whole band, and the musicianship,\" Felder posted on Instagram with a photo of himself with Weir.\"I feel so blessed to have been able to have him sing on 'Rock You' from American Rock and Roll. Until we meet again, amigo.\"His former publicist, Dennis McNally, spoke with BBC News about his music and the fun memories they shared.\"He had a very off-kilter, unusual sense of humour that was dry and funny,\" he said. \"The road was his life, and music was his life.\"He said playing and serving the music was what \"he was put on Earth for and he did it to the end\".",

    "body": "The US and its partner forces have carried out large-scale strikes against Islamic State (IS) group targets in Syria, the US Central Command (Centcom) has announced. US President Donald Trump directed the strikes on Saturday, which are part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, in retaliation to IS's deadly attack on US forces in Syria on 13 December, Centcom wrote on X.The strikes were conducted in an effort to combat terrorism and protect US and partner forces in the region, according to Centcom. \"Our message remains strong: if you harm our warfighters, we will find you and kill you anywhere in the world, no matter how hard you try to evade justice,\" Centcom said. The US and its partner forces fired more than 90 precision munitions at more than 35 targets in an operation that involved more than 20 aircraft, an official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.The official added that aircraft including F-15Es, A-10s, AC-130Js, MQ-9s and Jordanian F-16s had taken part in the strikes. The location of the strikes and the extent of any casualties is not yet clear.\"We will never forget, and never relent,\" Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X on Saturday in reference to the military action.  The Trump administration first announced the Operation Hawkeye Strike in December after an IS gunman killed two US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter in an ambush in Palmyra, located in the centre of Syria.\"This is not the beginning of a war - it is a declaration of vengeance,\" Hegseth said when announcing the operation in December. \"The United States of America, under President Trump's leadership, will never hesitate and never relent to defend our people.\"Prior to the latest strikes on Saturday, US forces killed or captured nearly 25 IS group members in 11 missions between 20 December and 29 December as part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, Centcom said. In the operation's first mission on 19 December, US and Jordanian forces carried out a \"massive strike\" against the IS group, deploying fighter jets, attack helicopters and artillery to strike \"more than 70 targets at multiple locations across central Syria\", according to Centcom. That operation, it said, \"employed more than 100 precision munitions\" targeting known IS infrastructure and weapons sites.Syria has been in a fragile state since the fall of President Bashar al-Assad's regime in December 2024, which effectively ended a civil war that had ravaged the country for 13 years. Ahmed al-Sharaa, also known by his nom-de-guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, has been serving as the country's president since his rebel group ousted Assad and solidified control.  The IS has been weakened in Syria, but still remains active, predominantly carrying out attacks against Kurdish-led forces in the north-east in 2025.",

It was very difficult.\"There were 15 of us all together, and we were there for four days. We prayed and prayed.\"We had nothing to eat, and the children cried and cried, but we could do nothing for them.\"In the early hours of Wednesday morning, Carolina went into labour and shortly afterwards she and the newborn were spotted by a South African military helicopter that was helping in the rescue operations.The two became symbols of the aftermath of the disaster, and they travelled to the US later in 2000 to speak to Congress and help raise awareness about what had happened.AFP via Getty ImagesCarolina and Rosita were photographed in Washington in July 2000 during a short trip thereOn Monday, confirming the news of Rosita's death at 25, her sister Celia Salvador told the BBC that she had \"passed away after a prolonged illness. I'm extremely sad. She died of an illness I am unable to explain what it was.\"According to other family sources, Rosita had been battling against the blood disorder anaemia for years. As a result of the worsening of her condition, she had been in hospital for more than two weeks, where she eventually died on Monday morning.\"My God. Very bad news. My condolences to the bereaved family,\" the president told the BBC.\"She was a symbol for girls in Mozambique. That's why, I extend my condolences to all the Mozambican people, especially to Mozambican girls.\"Rosita grew up with her family and graduated from high school in the same rural area – Chibuto – where she was born. She herself had a daughter five years ago.Political analyst Charles Mangwiro described her death as a \"wake-up call for the government to improve service delivery in the entire health system in the country. \"You cannot expect to survive when health professionals complain every day about unpaid salaries for months and about the shortage of essentials like protective materials and antibiotics.\"Despite recruiting more health workers in recent years, analysts continue to describe an overstretched health system short of basic drugs and equipment.Chibuto Mayor Henriques Machava told the press that conversations were under way with the family to formalise the funeral arrangements, which, according to him, would be taken care of by the municipality.More about Mozambique from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

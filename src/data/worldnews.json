    "body": "A Chinese woman has been charged with the theft of six gold nuggets worth about 1.5 million euros ($1.75m; £1.3m) from the Museum of Natural History in Paris last month, French prosecutors have said.The woman was arrested in Barcelona while trying to dispose of some melted gold, according to officials, and is being held in pre-trial detention.Famous for its stuffed animals and bone collections, the museum is home to a mineralogy gallery, from which the gold was taken. Police found an angle-grinder and a blowtorch at the scene.The museum's alarm and surveillance systems had been disabled by a cyber-attack, with the thieves apparently aware of this, French media reported at the time.\"The thieves, clearly very experienced and well-informed, exploited a security flaw that had not been identified during the last audit conducted in 2024,\" a museum spokesperson told French newspaper Le Figaro.Cleaners discovered the break-in when they arrived for work before dawn at the museum, which is part of the Sorbonne university and located near the Jardin des Plantes in central Paris.The suspect was arrested by Spanish police on 30 September on a European arrest warrant and handed over to French authorities on the same day, officials said in a statement.At the time of her arrest, she was in possession of around a kilogram of melted-down gold. Investigations are continuing, the statement added. It is believed she was preparing to leave for China.One of the largest stolen nuggets, originally from Australia, weighs 5kg. At the current gold price, it would be worth around €585,000.\"We are dealing with an extremely professional team, perfectly aware of where they needed to go, and with professional equipment,\" Emmanuel Skoulios, the museum director, told French broadcasters.\"It is absolutely not by chance that they went for these specific items,\" he told France 2 television last month.The charges come just days after thieves made off with priceless French crown jewels from the Louvre Museum in a separate, daring raid. On Sunday, \"professional\" thieves broke into the world's most-visited museum, stealing eight valued items before escaping on scooters. The raid took less than eight minutes, police said.Experts told the BBC that the items are likely to be broken up and sold for a fraction of their worth.\"This won't be their first heist,\" Dutch art detective Arthur Brand said of the thieves on Monday. \"They have done things before, other burglaries. They are confident and they thought, 'we might get away with this', and went for it.\"At least four French museums - including the Louvre and the natural history museum - have been robbed in recent months, according to media reports.",

    "body": "He also issued Combs a $500,000 (£374,000) fine and five years of probation.Combs had asked for a 14-month sentence that would have seen him released soon after the trial ended due to time spent in jail while awaiting trial, but prosecutors sought more than 11 years.At his sentencing hearing in September, Combs told a judge: \"My actions were disgusting, shameful, and sick.\"\"I got lost in excess, I got lost in my ego,\" he said. He begged the judge for \"mercy\" and apologised to two of the women who testified against him.His legal team signalled they would appeal both Combs' conviction and the judge's sentence.Combs was arrested in September 2024 and his nearly two-month trial this summer drew international media attention.Prosecutors accused him of using his powerful position in the music industry to run what amounted to a sex trafficking operation, and coercing his girlfriends to participate in so-called \"freak-offs\" with male escorts.Much of the case centred on his relationship with the singer Cassandra Ventura, who alleged Combs physically abused her and forced her to engage in \"hotel nights\" with male escorts. Another woman, who testified under the pseudonym Jane, said she felt pressured to participate in similar encounters even if she was unwell.A jury found Combs not guilty of the two most serious charges – sex trafficking and racketeering. But they did find him guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.",

Growing up to 40cm, it has large eyes and a glowing belly, and was found more than 600m below the ocean's surface.\"Lantern sharks are bioluminescent, with light produced by photophores located on their belly and flanks, which is where their common name comes from,\" Dr Will White, a fish scientist, said.CSIROThe West Australian lantern shark has large eyes and can grow up to 40cmThey also discovered a new type of porcelain crab, about 1.5cm in length and found about 122m below sea level. They use hairs to catch food, instead of their claws.\"Porcelain crabs are known as filter feeders, feeding on plankton by using modified mouthparts with long hairs to sweep the water for small pieces of food such as plankton, rather than the typical crab method of grabbing and pinching food with their claws,\" said Dr Andrew Hosie, curator of aquatic zoology from the Western Australian Museum.About 20 new species have been unearthed as a result of the voyage so far, including the Carnavon Flapjack Octopus, a rusty red creature around 4cm big.Researchers estimate about 600 more are yet to be described and named, as it can take years for scientists to gather the information to prove they're unique.",

    "body": "South Korean police said they will seek an arrest warrant for a woman who set fire to her apartment building while trying to kill a cockroach with an improvised flamethrower, local media reports.One of the woman's neighbours died after falling to the ground in a failed attempt to escape through a window.The woman, who is in her 20s, told police that she tried to torch the cockroach with a lighter and a flammable spray, adding that she had used the method before. But on Monday, items in her home caught fire.Police in the northern city of Osan said the woman could be charged with accidentally starting a fire and causing death by negligence.Blasting cockroaches - with blowtorches or homemade flamethrowers - has emerged as a novel way of getting rid of house pests, made popular by videos on social media.In 2018, an Australian man set fire to his kitchen while trying to kill cockroaches with a homemade flamethrower made from insect spray.The woman who died in the Osan city fire, a Chinese national in her 30s, lived on the fifth floor of the building with her husband and two-month-old baby.When they realised that a fire had broken out, the couple opened their home window and called for help.They handed their baby through the window to a neighbour in the adjacent block before trying to evacuate themselves.The woman's husband managed to climb over to the next block. She tried to do the same, but fell from the window. She was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead hours later.Police said they believed the couple had tried escaping through the window because thick smoke from the fire had blocked the stairway, local media report.The building houses commercial shops on its first floor and 32 residential units from its second to fifth floor.Eight other residents suffered from smoke inhalation because of the fire.",

    "body": "3 hours agoLaura GozziReutersPutin and Trump last met in August in Alaska and the US president had said further talks would take place in BudapestThere are \"no plans\" for Donald Trump to meet Vladimir Putin \"in the immediate future\", a White House official has stated.The US president said last Thursday that he and his Russian counterpart would hold talks in Budapest within two weeks to discuss the war in Ukraine.A preparatory meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was due to be held this week - but the White House said the two had had a \"productive\" call and that a meeting was no longer \"necessary\".The White House did not share any more details on why the talks had been put on hold.But key differences between US proposals and Russia's conditions for peace became increasingly clear this week, and appear to have dashed chances of a summit between the two presidents.Trump had discussed a Budapest summit over the phone with Putin, a day before meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House.Some reports suggested those talks had been a \"shouting match\", with sources suggesting Trump had pushed Zelensky to give up large areas of territory in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, known collectively as the Donbas, as part of a deal with Russia.However, Zelensky has always said Ukraine cannot relinquish the parts of the Donbas it still holds, on the grounds that Russia could later use the area as a springboard for further attacks. On Monday, Trump embraced a ceasefire proposal backed by Kyiv and European leaders to freeze the conflict on the current front line.\"Let it be cut the way it is,\" he said. \"I said: cut and stop at the battle line. Go home. Stop fighting, stop killing people.\"Russia has repeatedly pushed back against freezing the current line of contact.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the idea had been put to the Russians repeatedly but that \"the consistency of Russia's position doesn't change\" – referring to Moscow's insistence on the complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the embattled eastern regions.Moscow was only interested in \"long-term, sustainable peace\", Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday, implying that freezing the front line would only amount to a temporary ceasefire.The \"root causes of the conflict\" needed to be addressed, Lavrov said, using Kremlin shorthand for a series of maximalist demands that include the recognition of full Russian sovereignty over the Donbas as well as the demilitarisation of Ukraine – a non-starter for Kyiv and its European partners.Earlier on Tuesday, European leaders put out a statement with Zelensky saying that any talks on ending the war in Ukraine should start with freezing the current front line and accused Russia of not being \"serious\" about peace. Trump and Putin last met in Alaska in August, during a hastily organised summit which yielded no concrete results.The White House decision to shelve plans for a second Trump-Putin meeting may have been an attempt to avoid another similar scenario.\"I guess the Russians wanted too much and it became evident for the Americans that there will be no deal for Trump in Budapest,\" a senior European diplomat told Reuters.Zelensky said discussions about the front line were the \"beginning of diplomacy\",  which Russia was doing everything to avoid.The only topic that could make Moscow \"pay attention\" was the supply of long-range weapons to Ukraine, he added.Putin's unscheduled call with Trump last Thursday came following speculation that the US was preparing to send long-range Tomahawk missiles to Kyiv that could potentially strike deep into Russia.Zelensky said it was the Tomahawks issue that had forced Russia to engage in discussion. Despite coming away from the White House empty-handed, he added that the talk about the missiles had turned out to be a \"strong investment in diplomacy\".",

    "body": "5 hours agoLucy WilliamsonMiddle East Correspondent, JerusalemUnder Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza, the \"yellow line\" - which Israel withdrew to earlier this month - is the first of three stages of Israeli military withdrawal. It leaves it in control of about 53% of the Gaza Strip.One Israeli newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, referred to it as \"effectively the new border\" in Gaza.It's a remark that will please the far-right coalition partners of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.The fortifications and demarcations Israel is now building along this boundary are meant to clearly divide the territory, but they may also help to blur the differing hopes and expectations of Mr Netanyahu's allies in Washington and at home.How long he can keep both sets of expectations in play depends largely on this next stage of negotiations.The boundary marked by the yellow line is temporary, but further withdrawal of Israeli forces rests on resolving the difficult issues pinned to the second stage of Donald Trump's deal – including the transfer of power in Gaza and the process for disarming Hamas.Washington is keen that nothing upset this next delicate stage of negotiations. US Vice-President JD Vance flew in on Tuesday to push Netanyahu to press on with peace talks. Trump's negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner met with the Israeli PM on Monday.Israeli newspapers have been reporting that Netanyahu is receiving a stern message from his American allies to \"show restraint\" and not to endanger the ceasefire.When Israel complained that Hamas had violated the terms of the ceasefire on Sunday, killing two soldiers, the response advocated by Mr Netanyahu's far-right National Security Minister was a one-word demand: \"War\".Instead, Israel carried out an intense, but brief, wave of air strikes, before reinstating the truce, and was careful to emphasise that its troops had been attacked inside the yellow line – keen to show Washington that Israel had not broken the rules.Netanyahu has said the war will not end until Hamas is dismantled – its disarmament, and the full demilitarisation of Gaza, are among the conditions he has set.But Israeli commentators are lining up to say that the real decisions over Israel's military action in Gaza are now being made in Washington.The yellow line – and the daunting task facing negotiators in this second stage of the deal – are clues as to why Netanyahu's coalition partners have chosen to wait, rather than carry out a threat to bring down his government.The dream for many extremist settlers – and ministers – is that the next stage of this process will prove impossible to resolve and the yellow line will indeed become the de facto border, opening the way to new settlements on Gazan land. Some hardliners would like Israel to annex the whole of the Gaza Strip.The vast majority of Israelis want an end to the war and for the remaining bodies of the hostages, and Israel's serving soldiers, to come home.But Israel's prime minister is known as a politician who likes to keep his options as open as possible, for as long as possible, and this is a deal in stages, with caveats built in.Agreeing to this first stage meant withdrawing to positions that left Israel in control of more than half of Gaza, and agreeing to a ceasefire in order to get hostages home.From here, it will become harder to align the goals of his US and domestic allies.Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly underlined that violations of the deal by Hamas – including its failure to disarm – would allow Israel to return to war.\"If this is achieved the easy way, so much the better,\" he told the Israeli public earlier this month. \"If not, it will be achieved the hard way.\"Donald Trump has said the same.  But Washington has so far shown a tolerance for delays and violations in implementing the deal on the ground, leaving Netanyahu with far less political room than perhaps he'd like.",

    "body": "Belize has signed an agreement to act as a \"safe third country\" for migrants as they seek asylum in the United States.The small Central American nation's Prime Minister John Antonio Briceño said the deal - which still needs approval from the Belize Senate - will mean that migrants deported from the US could apply for asylum there instead of returning to their home countries.The US State Department called it \"an important milestone in ending illegal immigration\" and \"shutting down abuse\" of the US asylum system.The agreement appears to be similar to one with Paraguay announced in August.This year Panama, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras have also taken in people deported by the US.Human rights groups in the US and abroad have strongly criticised such deals, saying migrants face the risk of being sent to countries where they could be harmed.Belize's Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted on social media that the agreement \"includes strict security measures to protect Belize's national security and sovereignty\".\"The agreement gives Belize full authority to approve or reject transfers, limits eligibility to specific nationalities, and ensures comprehensive background checks, among other measures,\" it said.Briceño told local media that for Belize it will be \"more like a job programme, whereby people with certain qualifications can come to Belize\" and \"participate meaningfully in our economy\".He added that the country - which has a population of 417,000 - would prefer to take people from Central America, adding \"we're not going to open up to the whole world\".But opposition leader Tracy Taegar Panton expressed \"grave concern\" about the deal, saying it \"could reshape Belize's immigration and asylum systems, impose new financial burdens on taxpayers, and raise serious questions about national sovereignty and security\".The US State Department posted on X that the agreement was \"an important milestone in ending illegal immigration, shutting down abuse of our nation's asylum system, and reinforcing our shared commitment to tackling challenges in our hemisphere together\". Further details of the agreement have not yet been released.Since the start of his second term, US President Donald Trump has embarked on sweeping efforts to remove undocumented migrants - a key election promise that drew mass support during his campaign.In June, the US Supreme Court cleared the way for Trump to resume deportations of migrants to countries other than their homeland without giving them the chance to raise any risks they might face with officials.

The AQI measures the level of PM 2.5 - fine particulate matter that can clog lungs and cause a host of diseases - in the air.Levels between 101 and 200 are considered moderate, while those between 201 and 300 are \"poor\". Between 301 and 400 is categorised as \"very poor\" and a figure higher than 400 is considered \"severe\".The World Health Organization's guidelines say that exposure to PM 2.5 over a 24-hour-period should be limited to 15 micrograms per cubic metre - but Delhi's AQI in some parts is 24 times higher than the recommended level. The city's pollution problem becomes worse in winter as farmers in neighbouring states burn crop stubble. Low wind speeds also trap pollutants - such as those produced by firecrackers - in the lower atmosphere, making it hard to breathe.That's why firecrackers had been banned in Delhi and its suburbs during Diwali since 2020. However, this rule was not strictly enforced on the ground and crackers were still available for purchase in many shops, leading to its use during the festival.Last week, India's Supreme Court relaxed the blanket ban, allowing people to use so-called green crackers, which its makers say emit 20-30% less pollutants than traditional ones and generate minimal ash. Critics, however, have pointed out that even though comparatively less harmful, these crackers still release toxic substances into the air.In the run-up to Diwali, BBC reporters saw traditional crackers still being sold openly in shops. And while the court had allowed green crackers to be burst only during a limited window - one hour in the morning and two in the evening on Diwali and the day before it - the sound of fireworks could be heard well past midnight in many areas.On Tuesday, when BBC reporter Vikas Pandey left his home in Noida, a suburb of Delhi, at around 0600 local time (0030 GMT) to catch an early morning flight, he realised \"the familiar smell of burning charcoal was back\". \"The air was filled with smoke and visibility was poor. I could taste ash in my mouth. As the taxi entered Delhi, visibility became even poorer. The tall buildings which are usually visible at this hour had disappeared behind a thick veil of smog,\" he says.Experts are worried that the relaxing of rules around crackers could affect awareness around the dangers of air pollution which was being developed over the past few years.To be sure, Delhi's air quality was already in the \"very poor\" category, with AQI crossing 300, for around a week now, due to several factors such as low wind speed, vehicular emissions and stubble burning in neighbouring states. On Sunday, officials invoked the next stage of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi and its suburbs, imposing restrictions on the use of diesel generators and burning of coal and firewood in a bid to improve air quality.For now, as the familiar smog descends on Delhi, its residents appear resigned.\"You can't even think of stepping outside. The situation seems to be equally bad in densely populated areas and rural areas in Delhi today,\" said Paras Tyagi, who lives in the capital.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "European leaders have joined Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky in insisting that any talks on ending the war in Ukraine should start with freezing the current front line, and warned that Russia is not serious about peace.In a statement signed by 11 leaders including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, they said they \"strongly support\" US President Donald Trump's position that \"the fighting should stop immediately, and that the current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations\".But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday dismissed the idea of halting the conflict at the current contact line.Moscow was only interested in \"long-term, sustainable peace\", Lavrov said, implying that freezing the front line would only amount to a temporary ceasefire.The European statement referred to \"Russia's stalling tactics\", indicating how intractable Moscow's position remained.Trump, who has often adopted a conciliatory tone towards Russia, is now planning direct talks with Putin in Budapest - although the date for a preparatory meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Lavrov seems to be slipping. The US president spoke by phone to Putin last week, a day before meeting Zelensky and his team in the White House.Several sources have told Western media that Trump pushed the Ukrainian leader to give up large areas of territory in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, known as the Donbas, as part of a deal with Russia.Some reports suggested there had been a \"shouting match\". Zelensky only described the talks as \"frank\".The Ukrainian president has often ruled out withdrawing from the region, arguing that Russia could use it as a springboard for future attacks. \"I explained during my visit to Washington last week that Ukraine's position has not changed,\" he said on Monday.Although Russia has occupied most of Luhansk, Ukraine remains in control of about a quarter of Donetsk, including the key cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk.Trump, who later denied ever insisting that Zelensky surrender the Donbas, has since embraced the idea of a ceasefire on the current frontlines.\"Let it be cut the way it is,\" he said on Monday, referring to the contested region. \"It's cut up right now. I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia... I said: cut and stop at the battle line. Go home. Stop fighting, stop killing people.\"But Moscow continues to dismiss talk of a front line freeze.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the idea had been put to the Russians repeatedly but that \"the consistency of Russia's position doesn't change\" – referring to Moscow's insistence on the complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the embattled eastern regions.Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov repeated much the same lines on Tuesday.The \"root causes of the conflict\" needed to be addressed, Lavrov said, using Kremlin shorthand for a series of maximalist demands that include the recognition of full Russian sovereignty over the Donbas as well as the demilitarisation of Ukraine – a non-starter for Kyiv and its European partners.The Kremlin has played down expectations of an imminent meeting between Putin and Trump. \"We cannot postpone what has not been finalised,\" Peskov said.Lavrov and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio were meant to meet this week to organise the summit, but no timings have yet been given.A potential meeting between Trump and Putin in Hungary would require at least one EU country to open its air space to the Russian leader's plane. Putin is subject to an international arrest warrant for war crimes, and Poland and Lithuania have already signalled they would execute it if he were to travel through their countries.Another route into Budapest for Putin would be through Bulgarian airspace. Foreign Minister Georg Georgiev hinted Bulgaria would be willing to let the plane through.\"When efforts are made for peace, it is only logical that all sides contribute to making such a meeting possible,\" he said.Trump and Putin last met in Alaska in August during a hastily organised summit which yielded few results apart from bringing to an end Putin's status as a pariah of the West.For some time after the talks, Trump put forward the idea of organising a Putin-Zelensky bilateral summit.But Russia said such a meeting was contingent on the \"root causes\" of the war being addressed first, and the idea was eventually quietly shelved by all parties.Since starting his second term in office Trump has lamented that the Russian-Ukrainian war, now in its fourth year, is \"difficult\" to solve.",

    "body": "Jewellery stolen from the Louvre in Paris in a daring daylight robbery has been valued at 88 million euros (£76m; $102m), a French public prosecutor has said, citing the museum's curator.Laure Beccuau told RTL radio the sum was \"extraordinary\" but said the greater loss was to France's historical heritage. Crown jewels and pieces gifted by two Napoleons to their wives were among the items taken.Thieves wielding power tools took less than eight minutes to make off with the loot shortly after the world's most-visited museum opened on Sunday morning.With the thieves having not been caught more than two days on from the heist, experts fear the jewellery will already be long gone.Ms Beccuau said she hoped announcing the estimated worth of the jewellery would make the robbers think twice and not destroy them.She added the thieves would not pocket the full windfall if they had \"the very bad idea of melting down these jewels\".The items taken, previously described as having inestimable worth, include a diamond and emerald necklace Emperor Napoleon gave to his wife, a tiara worn by Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III, and several pieces previously owned by Queen Marie-Amelie.Investigators found a damaged crown that used to belong to Empress Eugenie on the thieves' escape route - apparently having been dropped as they departed in haste.Four masked thieves used a truck equipped with a mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine.Two of them cut through a glass window on the first floor using a battery-powered disc cutter and entered the museum. They then threatened the guards inside, who evacuated the building.The thieves had tried to set fire to their vehicle outside but were prevented by the intervention of a member of museum staff. They were seen making off on scooters.French President Emmanuel Macron described the robbery as an attack on France's heritage.Security measures have been tightened around the country's cultural institutions, after a preliminary report found one in three rooms in the Louvre lacked CCTV and that its wider alarm system did not go off.Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin said security protocols had \"failed\", lamenting that the thieves being able to drive a modified truck up to the museum had left France with a \"terrible image\".Authorities believe they are chasing a team of professionals, given how quick and organised they were.Experts in art recovery previously told the BBC investigators had just one or two days to track down the items before they could be considered gone for good.It is most likely they have been broken down into precious metals and gems, smuggled out of the country and sold for a fraction of their worth, other experts have said.

    "body": "23 hours agoMark Lowen andAlison RobertsLisbonA preliminary report into last month's funicular crash in Lisbon that killed 16 people has detailed a litany of failings.Portugal's Air and Rail Accident Investigations Bureau said an underground cable - which acted as a counterweight between two carriages and broke, causing the crash - was defective and had never been certified for passenger transportation. It said the cable was not technically suitable and was acquired in 2022 by Carris, the company running Lisbon's public transport that now says it has dismissed its head of maintenance of furniculars and trams.The 140-year-old Glória funicular, popular with tourists, derailed and crashed into a building on 3 September.There were 11 foreigners among those killed, including the three British nationals, while another 20 people were injured.The preliminary report, released on Monday, said there had been no oversight by Carris engineers and the cable was not tested before it was installed. The supervision and maintenance of the funicular by a company outsourced by Carris also did not work properly - apparently giving the Glória funicular the all-clear on the morning of the disaster, though it is not certain if the check actually took place that day.The emergency brake system, which the driver correctly tried to apply when the cable snapped, did not function properly and was never tested in advance, the report said.However, the preliminary report emphasised that the information gathered to date was \"incomplete\", with further tests and analysis needed.\"The guilt or responsibility of any organisation or person involved in the incident should not be presumed,\" it said.Lisbon's Mayor Carlos Moedas, who was re-elected on 12 October despite opposition accusations he had failed in his duty of oversight over the city's funiculars, told SIC television that the report \"reaffirms that the unfortunate tragedy... was due to technical and not political causes\".Carris issued a statement stressing it was \"not possible at this time to state whether or not the non-conformities in the use of the cable are relevant to the accident\", referring to a passage in the report that notes the same cables had been in use on the Glória funicular for 601 days without incident.According to the accident report: \"At this point in time, it cannot be said whether the use of this type of non-compliant cable intervened, or what intervention it had, in the rupture... and it is certain for the investigation that there were other factors that had to intervene.\"The company stressed that, though the cables had been brought into use under the current board of directors, who took office in May 2022, the acquisition process took place under the previous board.Among other safety recommendations to be further detailed are that Carris implement a new safety management system in line with European best practice.The full report will take about 11 months to complete. If that is delayed, a more detailed interim report will be released instead.Meanwhile, all Lisbon cable cars have been ordered to be out of service until the necessary safety checks are put in place. All braking systems need to be reviewed to see if they can stop the carriages if the cable fails - which had not been the case in the Glória accident - the report advised.It also recommended closing a loophole whereby Lisbon's historic funiculars are exempt from legal and supervisory oversight that applies to other cable-driven forms of transport.",

    "body": "The US and Australia have signed a deal intended to boost supplies of rare earths and other critical minerals, as the Trump administration looks for ways to counter China's dominance of the market. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the deal would support a pipeline of $8.5bn (A$13bn; £6.3bn) \"ready-to-go\" projects that would expand his country's mining and processing abilities. It includes $1bn to be invested by the two countries in projects in the US and Australia over the next six months, a framework text says.The US and Australia have been working on these issues since Trump's first term, but Albanese said the latest agreement would take the partnership to the \"next level\".On Monday, US President Donald Trump also commented on Australia's multi-billion dollar submarine deal with the US and UK, known as Aukus, saying it was \"full steam ahead\".Earlier this year, the deal came under the spotlight after the Trump administration said it would review the details to ensure it fit with its \"America First\" agenda, raising concerns Australia may not be able to buy US submarines to replace its ageing fleet.Asked if Australia would be getting the submarines, Trump said: \"Oh no, they're getting them\".China currently controls about 70% of rare earths mining and 90% of the processing of the materials, which are found in everything from defence equipment to computer chips and cars.US companies rely heavily on the materials, making them vulnerable this year as China has taken steps to restrict access to supplies in response to new US tariffs and other tensions.The shares in Australia rare earths mining companies jumped on Tuesday after the announcement.Perth-based firm Arafura Rare Earths surged by around 7.7%, while another major producer, Iluka Resources, gained by more than 3%.Albanese said the agreement was aimed at speeding investment in three types of projects, including US investments in processing facilities in Australia.The two countries also agreed to work together on issues such as pricing, permitting, and rules for government review of the sales of companies and projects in the sector.The US separately said it would invest in the construction of a 100 tonnes-per-year advanced gallium refinery in Western Australia and was preparing to offer some $2.2bn in financing to advance critical minerals projects via its Export-Import Bank. The Trump administration in recent months has already announced a series of investments in companies such as US rare earths miner MP Materials and Canada's Trilogy Metals and Lithium America's, which have projects in the US.In exchange for the support, it has received ownership stakes in the firms.Ahead of the meeting, shares in Australian companies such as Lynas Rare Earths had jumped on the prospect of increased support. Lynas was awarded a contract by the US Defense Department a few years ago and is working on a project in Texas.The framework published by the White House was light on details, reflecting the delicate issues at play.Australia is a major source of critical minerals but like the US, it relies on China, its biggest trade partner, for the processing required to turn the materials into something companies can use.",

Residents of the city reported hearing explosions in several districts early on Tuesday morning. Social media images - yet to be verified by the BBC - appear to show a series of blasts. There is no information on casualties or damage, and no-one has claimed responsibility.On Monday, Sudan's Civil Aviation Authority had announced the airport would reopen on Wednesday, months after the army recaptured Khartoum from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and began repairing the heavily damaged airport.Tuesday's strike marked the third attack in the capital within a week, following strikes on two army bases in north-west Khartoum on consecutive days last week. The Sudan Tribune news website cites a security source as saying that anti-aircraft defences had intercepted several drones after 04:00 local time (02:00 GMT) but gave no details on any damage.The international airport shut down shortly after fighting erupted between the army and the RSF in April 2023, when the paramilitary force took control of it. Sudan war: A simple guide to what is happeningSudanese city under siege: 'My son's whole body is full of shrapnel'Port Sudan, in the east, has the country's only functioning international airport, although it has been targeted by drones.Khartoum has remained relatively calm since the army retook control of the city in March, but attacks have persisted, with the RSF accused of targeting civilian and military infrastructure from a distance. Since the loss of the capital, the RSF has intensified efforts to capture el-Fasher - the army's last stronghold in the western Darfur region. The ongoing conflict has killed tens of thousands and forced millions from their homes.What started as power struggle between the army and the RSF has since drawn in other Sudanese armed groups and foreign backers, plunging the country into what the UN calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis.",

    "body": "Kevin Federline has held off writing about Britney Spears. Until now12 hours agoAna Faguy,James FitzGerald andNardine SaadGetty ImagesThe pair's divorce was finalised in 2007The ex-husband of pop star Britney Spears gives new details on the pair's tense relationship in his new memoir You Thought You Knew.Kevin Federline, her one-time backing dancer, presents a picture of Spears's allegedly erratic behaviour as a wife and mother, and says he continues to have concerns for her wellbeing.Spears has spoken out against the book, which will be published on Tuesday, and accuses Federline of trying to profit from his association with her.Federline makes a number of allegations against Spears, in the memoir shared with the BBC ahead of the book's release by publisher Listenin. He accuses Spears of unhealthy behaviour as a mother, including drinking when she was pregnant and taking cocaine while her two sons were still breastfeeding. Spears has previously denied having substance abuse issues.When they were teenagers, the couple's sons were fearful of Spears, Federline also alleges. \"They would awaken sometimes at night to find her standing silently in the doorway, watching them sleep - 'Oh, you're awake?' - with a knife in her hand,\" he writes. \"Then she'd turn around and pad off without explanation.\"Federline also expresses his concern for his estranged ex-wife, writing: \"The truth is, this situation with Britney feels like it's racing toward something irreversible. From where I sit, the clock is ticking, and we're getting close to the 11th hour.\"He writes that he was supportive of a conservatorship, under which many aspects of Spears's life were controlled by others for years, and described it as a \"lifeline\" in its early days.He claims Spears saw the events in her life \"through a prism that painted her as the victim, the misunderstood one\", but that she \"needed help\" and was \"in no state to responsibly manage her own affairs\".Of the Free Britney movement, Federline writes that he could \"never fully get behind it\".What's the history of their relationship?The pair got together in the summer of 2004, as Spears's initial commercial peak started to wane.They married a few months later and quickly welcomed their two sons: Preston, now 20, and Jayden, now 19.Spears filed for divorce in 2006 and the divorce was finalised in 2007.The couple fought publicly over custody of their sons and ultimately Federline was given sole custody of the boys.In the wake of Federline getting full custody, Spears was seen behaving in a way that Federline characterises in his book as erratic.She made headlines with incidents like shaving her head and hitting a photographer's car with an umbrella.Those public incidents raised concern about her mental welfare, and after she was taken to hospital twice, a temporary conservatorship was established in 2008 and made permanent later that year.Spears remained under that controversial arrangement until 2021, under which her father and others controlled her finances and aspects of her personal life. She did not regain custody of her children until after it was lifted.Federline recalls that time as being \"like watching someone slowly lose control of their life\".\"I've lost faith that things will ever fully turn around, but I still hope that Britney can find peace,\" he adds.What has Spears said? Spears has accused Federline of attacking her during his recent press appearances to promote the book. She described the contents of the memoir as \"extremely hurtful and exhausting\", but suggested the work would sell better than her own memoir had done.In that book, The Woman in Me, Spears accused her ex-husband of trying to \"convince everyone I was completely out of control\".Spears has also defended her relationship with her sons. \"I have always pleaded and screamed to have a life with my boys,\" she wrote on social media on 15 October, adding that \"relationships with teenage boys is complex\".In a statement to US media, a Spears spokesperson added: \"With news from Kevin's book breaking, once again he and others are profiting off her and sadly it comes after child support has ended with Kevin. All she cares about are her kids, Sean Preston and Jayden James, and their well-being during this sensationalism. She detailed her journey in her memoir.\"The BBC has contacted Federline's lawyer for comment on Spears's counter-accusations.Why is this happening now?While the pair dominated headlines during their relationship and subsequent divorce, Federline in particular has largely remained out of the limelight in recent years. And recently, the spotlight on Spears has largely been over her social media postings.Federline has said he considered writing a book for many years but wanted to wait until his children were older to complete it because he did not want make the weight of the world \"heavier\" on their shoulders.\"This is about finally telling my story,\" he writes. \"My version. In my words. Because everybody else has done it for me. The media. The blogs. The exes. The strangers. The jokes. The headlines. They all had something to say about me. And I stayed quiet.\"He denies claims that he \"was just coasting off her money\" and insists he was \"out there hustling, grinding, investing —working to build a solid foundation for myself and my kids\".He says he avoided responding publicly to media reports about him over the years because he wanted to protect his loved ones and give his kids \"some kind of normal life\".\"But silence didn't bring peace. It left me choking on the words I never said,\" he adds.",

    "body": "6 hours agoVanessa Buschschlüter@realDonaldTrump/Truth SocialA screengrab of the video shared by US President Donald Trump showing the submarine in open waters before it was struckEcuador has released the survivor of a US strike on a submarine alleged to have been smuggling drugs in the Caribbean.US military forces captured the Ecuadorean national along with a Colombian citizen after they attacked the submarine the two were on. US President Donald Trump said they would be returned to their countries of origin \"for detention and prosecution\".But the Ecuadorean Attorney General's office has said in a statement that the Ecuadorean survivor \"could not be detained\" because there was \"no report of a crime that has been brought to the attention of this institution\".The US has conducted a series of strikes on what it describes as drug-smuggling vessels in the region.Ecuadorean officials had earlier identified one of the survivors of Thursday's strike as Andrés Fernando Tufiño.He and the Colombian man, who has been named as 34-year-old Jeison Obando Pérez, are the first two people to survive one of the strikes the US has been carrying out in the Caribbean as part of a massive counter-narcotics deployment.Two other men aboard the semi-submersible were killed in the attack, according to Trump.The US military has said that at least 32 people have been killed in at least seven separate strikes carried out since the beginning of September. Experts have questioned the legality of the attacks, arguing they breach international law. But the Trump administration has insisted that it was targeting \"narco-terrorists\".Asked about the two survivors by reporters at the White House on Friday, Trump said that they had been aboard \"a drug-carrying submarine built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs\".\"This was not an innocent group of people,\" he added. \"I don't know too many people who have submarines, and that was an attack on a drug-carrying, loaded submarine.\"The US president alleged in a post on his Truth Social account that the vessel had been carrying \"mostly fentanyl, and other illegal narcotics\".Experts on drug trafficking have pointed out that fentanyl enters the US predominantly from Mexico and not from countries bordering the southern Caribbean, where the US deployment is taking place. Around 10,000 US troops, as well as dozens of military aircraft and ships, have been deployed to the Caribbean as part of the operation. Trump also posted a 30-second video showing the semi-submersible in choppy waters before it was hit by at least one projectile.The two men were rescued by a US military helicopter and then taken onto a US warship in the Caribbean, before being repatriated.According to an unnamed official quoted by the Associated Press, the Ecuadorean survivor was in good health. AP also reported that it had seen a document from the Ecuadorean government which outlined that \"there is no evidence or indication that could lead prosecutors or judicial authorities to be certain\" that Tufiño had violated any current laws in Ecuadorean territory.The Colombian survivor arrived in his homeland \"with a traumatic brain injury, sedated, medicated, and breathing with the help of a ventilator\", according to Colombia's interior minister.He is being treated in a hospital in the capital, Bogotá, local media reports.The minister, Armando Benedetti, said that the man had been on \"a vessel full of cocaine, and that in our country is a crime\".The US deployment in the Caribbean has mainly been targeting vessels leaving Venezuela, according to US officials.Trump has accused his Venezuelan counterpart, Nicolás Maduro, of leading a drug-trafficking group called the Cartel of the Suns.Maduro has denied the allegations and says the aim of the operations is to topple him from power.The Venezuelan leader, whose re-election last year has not been recognised by the US and many other nations, has appealed directly to Trump, saying he wants \"peace\".But the US government has been increasing its pressure on Maduro, with Trump confirming last week that the had given to go-ahead for the CIA to carry out covert operations in Venezuela.US officials have said that previous strikes on \"narco-boats\" targeted the Tren de Aragua gang, which has its base in Venezuela.But as more boats are hit, questions about the identities of those aboard have been mounting.Colombian President Gustavo Petro accused the US of attacking one vessel in \"Colombian territorial waters\" in September, saying the strike constituted \"murder\".In response, Trump called Petro \"an illegal drug leader\" who had \"strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields, all over Colombia\". He also said that the US would no longer offer aid to Colombia and threatened to impose tariffs on Colombian goods.Media in Trinidad and Tobago have also pressured the twin island nation's government to investigate reports that two of their nationals were killed in one of the strikes. However, Trinidad and Tobago's government on Tuesday expressed its \"strong support for the ongoing military intervention of the United States of America in the region\".\"These operations aimed at combatting narco and human trafficking and other forms of transnational crime are ultimately aimed at allowing the region to be a true 'Zone of Peace' where all citizens can, in reality, live and work in a safe environment,\" the foreign ministry said in a statement.Additional reporting by BBC News Mundo",

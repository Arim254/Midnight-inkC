    "body": "Murder and MI5: How an extraordinary battle erupted over what the state keeps secret2 days agoDaniel De SimoneInvestigations correspondent BBCListen to Daniel read this storyPaul Thompson was shot dead while being driven home in a taxi through Belfast in April 1994. He was murdered in a sectarian attack by loyalist paramilitaries who had set out to kill Catholics.The taxi driver was a friend who was collecting a fare at another address in the Springfield Park area in the west of the city. But no one at the address had rung the taxi firm. The call is suspected to have been a deliberate decoy by the killers who wanted to lure a taxi as prey. Paul was not specifically targeted. They could not have known he would ask for a lift or be in the area.One resident described hearing a heavy burst of gunfire after 23:00, running to the car and finding Paul.Members of a banned loyalist terror group, the Ulster Defence Association, using the cover name Ulster Freedom Fighters, claimed responsibility for the killing. During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the group repeatedly murdered Catholic civilians like Paul.Family Handout/PA WireMembers of a banned loyalist terror group, the Ulster Defence Association, using the cover name Ulster Freedom Fighters, claimed responsibility for killing Paul, who was nicknamed TopperOn the morning of the day that Paul was killed, locals had told police about a hole in a barrier – known as the 'Peace Line' – which separated the largely Catholic Springfield Park area from a largely Protestant neighbouring area. The residents were concerned the breach could give loyalist paramilitaries access to launch an attack.The hole was not fixed. After the murder, those responsible escaped through it.An inquest into Paul's death was opened in 1995 but never concluded. No-one has ever been held to account. There has never been a full investigation.Left by themselves to fight for answers, his mother Margaret and brother Eugene, both now dead, came to suspect collusion between British security forces and informants – meaning state agents - in the group responsible.In 2024, a coroner decided to release to the family a summary of secret information held by the police. This was said by the coroner to be of central relevance to the case and the police supported the move. But the British government and MI5 argued this would prejudice national security and mounted a legal challenge.PA MediaPaul Thompson was killed by the UDA, which used the cover name of the Ulster Freedom FightersThe case, which centred on who had the power to decide to release the information, reached the Supreme Court last summer, with Paul Thompson's brother, Eugene, tuning in to hearings from a hospice, as he neared death from cancer.The case is widely viewed as a major test of the state's policy of neither confirming nor denying (NCND) information involving national security.Who decides what is secret?The NCND policy is a position adopted by the government and security services when responding to questions about sensitive matters. It means there will be no confirmation, no denial, and no acknowledgement that the information requested is true, false, or even exists.Eugene Thompson's barrister, Monye Anyadike-Danes KC, said the family had concluded the murder happened because the authorities were colluding with the \"very group that actually perpetrated the killing\". She said Eugene was \"trying to find out why his younger brother was murdered\" and felt a \"deep responsibility\".PA MediaEugene Thompson, who has since died, spent years trying to find out the truth about his brother's deathEugene, she added, believed the public should be able to trust that those who kill will be held accountable, especially when they are agents of the state. She asked the judges not to let the NCND policy be used to \"conceal the involvement of state parties in the killing of an ordinary citizen\".Just before Christmas, the court ruled that the government's assessment of damage to national security \"should have been accepted by the coroner\" unless it was plainly irrational or there was no supporting evidence.The justices found the coroner had failed to understand it was \"solely\" for the government to make submissions on national security, not the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), Jon Boutcher, who had argued for the release of the summary of police files.PA WireJon Boutcher argued for the release of the summary of police filesPaul Thompson's case is part of a battle over the truth and whether it can be told. The battle concerns official secrets, often connected to state agents, and it pits bereaved families and senior police officers against the government and the security service, MI5.It raises a profound question: can the state, especially when it is implicated in killing, be trusted as the arbiter of what should remain secret?The spycatcher who was himself a spyOther cases in the coming months will force these issues further into the spotlight – and they come at a time when MI5's integrity is under significant scrutiny.Yet the Supreme Court's ruling in the Thompson case creates a precedent that says the government and MI5 can withhold information from bereaved families, for national security reasons, even when the police want it to be disclosed.Grainne Teggart, from Amnesty International, described it as a \"grim day for truth\" and part of a pattern of \"national security being used as a shield to cover up and conceal the state's role in very serious crimes such as murder and other serious human rights violations.\"The government, by contrast, welcomed the court's \"unanimous judgment\".\"This is a highly complex case with wide-ranging implications,\" it said. \"The government will therefore take time to fully consider all aspects of this judgment.\"The Supreme Court's ruling in the Thompson case has created a precedentDuring the Troubles, the state made widespread use of informants, otherwise known as agents, who were tasked with carrying out actions and often paid. Agents existed in the IRA and in loyalist paramilitary groups. They were run by the police, the army, and MI5.The former Met Police chief Lord Stevens, who led UK government-commissioned investigations into collusion in Northern Ireland between the 1980s and 2000s, once said that of 210 people arrested during his enquiries, only three were not state agents.Collusion occurred in a number of ways, he said, ranging from the state withholding intelligence and evidence from investigators, to state agents being involved in murder. In some cases agents told the authorities in advance about planned attacks but nothing was done to stop them.One of the most notorious agents was codenamed Stakeknife. It has been publicly known for more than 20 years that Stakeknife was a man called Freddie Scappaticci. He died under MI5 protection in 2023 having never been charged with any of the many murders and other crimes to which he is linked.Pacemaker Press/ PAFreddie Scappaticci, or Stakeknife, died under MI5 protection in 2023Scappaticci was a senior figure in the IRA's internal security unit, which was tasked by IRA leaders with identifying and killing British agents in the organisation. But, with the spycatcher himself a spy, the result was one British agent killing other agents, or people accused of being agents, and the state repeatedly not intervening to save them.Intelligence agencies and historic wrongdoingA long-running police investigation into Stakeknife, Operation Kenova, was forbidden from officially naming Scappaticci in its final report, published in December, despite the fact that his identity was widely known.The head of the Kenova team, Sir Iain Livingstone, pleaded with Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn for the right to name Scappaticci in his report, but Benn said he would decide after the Supreme Court ruling in the Paul Thompson case, which came later in December.That ruling has, in effect, strengthened Benn's power to stop him being named. If permission is granted, a revised version of the Kenova report can be published.Jon Boutcher, who was Livingstone's predecessor leading the Kenova investigation, has described the situation preventing Scappaticci being named as a \"pantomime\". It leads to the truth being \"suppressed,\" he argues, with \"profound and severe adverse impacts on victims and families, legitimate public discussion and debate, media freedom, open justice and public confidence in state agencies and the criminal justice system\".PA WireThe integrity of MI5, which is currently led by Sir Ken McCallum, is under scrutinyBoutcher, the PSNI chief constable, is involved in a significant and extraordinary stand-off with the government and MI5 over NCND.He has called for reform of the policy, a principle he fully supports but believes is being wrongly applied and has become a dogma that can be used to conceal wrongdoing.He has recommended the policy is reviewed to ensure it is applied proportionately and only where genuinely necessary for the protection of life or national security. The government has not yet responded to the call for a review of the policy.Boutcher has directly asked whether NCND's continued application on Stakeknife amounts to it being used as a tool for covering up things that should never have happened.\"I question whether this decision protects agents, or rather does it actually protect the government and intelligence agencies from accountability for historical wrongdoing.\"More from InDepthIn the Paul Thompson case he argued that he, as chief constable, rather than the government, had the right to allow the coroner to release a summary of police files. The high court and court of appeal backed his position before it was ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court.During the hearings, government barrister Sir James Eadie KC said Boutcher was being \"thoroughly disingenuous\" and that \"politics is being played with national security\". He argued the government is best placed to make assessments on national security, as only it has access to the full range of necessary advice. The principal advice, in this context, is from MI5.The argument the government is best informed seemed somewhat at odds with the fact the MI5 officer whose sworn statement was provided to support the case had not read the relevant underlying material.For the chief constable of Northern Ireland to be at loggerheads with MI5 is \"unprecedented\" says veteran investigative journalist, John Ware, who has reported on the Troubles since the 1970s.\"If anybody had told me even 10 years ago that there would come a time when the chief constable of the PSNI and the Security Service were at loggerheads, I would have fallen off my stool,\" he says.Trust, state secrecy and the publicBoutcher has a raised a stark question: can the authorities who played a role in the events, including MI5, be trusted to decide whether to tell the public about what happened, when doing so could leave them exposed?He has also indirectly raised this question about the legal system itself - due to its own role in the Stakeknife case.Scappaticci helped create a legal precedent on state secrecy that is routinely cited by the government to this day.In 2003, he sought a judicial review over the then government's refusal to publicly deny media reports that he was Stakeknife.But Scappaticci was bluffing and did not actually want to succeed, since if the government was ordered to tell the truth, he would have been confirmed as Stakeknife. Scappaticci was engaged in a pretence to help shore up his reputation: publicly fighting a legal case, while hoping – and expecting – he would lose.VCG via Getty ImagesMany families of those killed or injured in the Troubles are still fighting through the courtsHowever, the government feared Scappaticci would win because a judge would assume he was not Stakeknife and force ministers to be honest.Jon Boutcher has now confirmed an extraordinary fact: the judge who heard the case did so after being secretly briefed on the real identity of Stakeknife.That judge, the then Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, Lord Carswell, ultimately allowed the government to maintain NCND, creating the legal precedent on the policy.\"The full facts about this and the government's explanation will never be known while it is able to hide behind the shield of NCND,\" Boutcher has said.There is a second extraordinary fact: the government barrister who did the secret briefing was Philip Sales, who as Lord Sales was one of the Supreme Court justices in the Paul Thompson case. This fact was uncovered by the journalist John Ware.This is an issue because it is Lord Sales' ruling in the Thompson case which has a central bearing over whether Scappaticci can be named and more details revealed about what went on, including Lord Sales' own role.I asked the Supreme Court whether, given Lord Sales' role in the Scappaticci matter, if it was appropriate for him to have heard the Thompson case.In a statement, the court said: \"Great care is taken in the selection of the panels which will hear a case at the UK Supreme Court.\"A Justice will not deal with a case where it is considered there is a conflict of interest and individual Justices are careful to ensure that they have none.\"The cases of Seamus Dillon and Sean BrownTwo further cases that touch on the potential release of information about the role of the state during the Troubles are also before the Supreme Court.Troubles-related inquests were shut down in 2024 with the passing of the Legacy Act, which created a new body called the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) to examine relevant cases, including those being investigated by police.The families of four men who were either killed or injured during the Troubles won a further legal victory, when the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal ruled the government has too much veto power over the disclosure of material by the ICRIR.Lady Chief Justice Siobhan Keegan said that the provision in the Act giving the Northern Ireland secretary \"the final say\" on disclosure of sensitive national security information by the ICRIR would risk undermining public confidence in the body.The UK government's appeal will be ruled on by the Supreme Court in the coming months. The lead respondent in the case is Martina Dillon, whose husband Seamus was killed in 1997.PA WireMartina Dillon's husband Seamus was killed in 1997 by the paramilitary Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF)The paramilitary Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) claimed responsibility. A coroner had opened an inquest on the basis there was evidence of collusion by state authorities, but the inquest was halted by the Legacy Act. No-one has ever been held accountable.The government has also registered an appeal in another key case.Sean Brown was also murdered in 1997 by members of the LVF. The 61-year-old father-of-six was abducted as he locked the gates at a sports club in County Londonderry. There were investigative failures by police and no-one has been brought to justice.PA MediaSean Brown, a father of six, was abducted as he locked the gates at a sports clubDecades later, a coroner issued a summary of secret material stating that \"a number of the individuals linked through intelligence to the murder were agents of the state.\" Sean's family want a public inquiry, and have won judgments over the past two years at the High Court and Court of Appeal. The government, which was found to have acted unlawfully by refusing a public inquiry, has registered an appeal to the Supreme Court on the basis the issue has constitutional significance regarding who should order inquiries.'The state viewed itself as above the law'At its heart, this vast battle over secrecy centres on two core claims by the state: that only the government and MI5 can ultimately be fully trusted on national security, and that their decisions on what information to release are solely about protecting the public.But these claims have been undermined by MI5's actions and omissions in several recent cases, all during the leadership of MI5's current director general, Sir Ken McCallum.A public inquiry into the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, which killed 22 people, concluded that MI5 had not given an \"accurate picture\" of the key intelligence it held about the suicide bomber who carried out the attack. The inquiry chairman only uncovered what MI5 had done through his own persistent investigations during secret evidence sessions.The government has been resisting calls by families bereaved by the Manchester Arena attack for MI5 officers to be fully included in planned new legislation - known as the Hillsborough Law - that's designed to stop cover-ups and enforce truth-telling by public officials.Getty ImagesA public inquiry into the Manchester Arena bombing concluded that MI5 had not given an \"accurate picture\" of key intelligence it heldAnother ongoing case is an example of how MI5's evidence cannot always be taken at face value: MI5 gave false evidence to three courts about having maintained its NCND secrecy policy in relation to an abusive neo-Nazi agent who attacked his girlfriend with a machete. But MI5 had in fact told me the man was an agent when attempting to prevent me from investigating him. After MI5 apologised, we then showed that inquiries into what happened by MI5 and the government were deficient and unreliable, with further falsehoods provided to the court. This prompted the most senior judge in England and Wales to dismiss MI5's explanations and led the prime minister to order a new investigation, which will report this year.In the Stakeknife investigation, MI5 disclosed key documents years after enquiries began, aer Scappaticci had died and charging decisions had been made, and at a point when the Legacy Act banned police from investigating further. The new material revealed MI5 had greater and earlier knowledge of Stakeknife than detectives had previously been told, including that MI5 had been involved in tasking him. The lead detective said it was a \"significant failure on the part of MI5\". A review commissioned by MI5 found no deliberate wrongdoing.Cover-ups and failures to disclose information have a long history in Northern Ireland. Lord Stevens, recalling his investigations, has said: \"I was misled deliberately, I was criminally obstructed from doing my job by the Royal Ulster Constabulary and military, whilst MI5 failed to disclose information.\"Judge Pomerance, who was senior counsel on another major investigation, concluded bluntly: \"The state viewed itself as above the law\".The battle of bereaved familiesLast July, days before Eugene Thompson died, Jon Boutcher delivered a letter of apology on behalf of PSNI. He apologised for the police's failure to take action that may have prevented Paul Thompson's murder, and for failures in the investigation, including not properly pursuing suspects.Mark Thompson from Relatives for Justice (no relation of Paul and Eugene Thompson) says the apology was \"important\" but that Eugene was by this stage \"very ill\".Thompson familyJust before he died, Eugene Thompson (right) received an apology for police failings over the murder of his brother Paul (left). Their mother Margaret is also picturedMark had watched the Supreme Court hearings with Eugene on a laptop in his hospice and describes the experience as \"tough\". Eugene was \"praying and hoping that before he died the judgment could be made\", Mark says.Bereaved families caught up in these cases have had to battle for decades, trying to fill voids left by the lack of proper investigations by the state.\"You became an investigator, tracking down witnesses. You became an expert in the law in that field. And you fought your own case tooth and nail.\"Eugene Thompson became an \"accidental lawyer and expert in his own case\", he says, as he campaigned for answers about why his brother Paul was murdered.\"I think if we take anything from the legacy of him, it's the example of never giving up.\"Top image credit: PA MediaEmail: security.investigations@bbc.co.ukSignal: @investigation.56Click here to learn how to use SecureDrop, an anonymous whistleblowing tool that works only in the Tor browser and follow the advice to stay secure.BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "As the world inches back to a pre-WW2 order, the 'middle powers' face a grave new challenge3 days agoAllan LittleSenior correspondentBBCI had been asked to give a keynote speech at a conference at Columbia University's Journalism School. It was January 2002. Two planes had been flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center months earlier and you could still feel how wounded the city felt. You could read it in the faces of New Yorkers you spoke to.In my speech I made a few opening remarks about what the United States had meant to me. \"I was born 15 years after the Second World War,\" I said, \"in a world America made. The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement.\"American military might had won the war in the West, I continued. It had stopped the further westward expansion of Soviet power.I talked briefly about the transformational effect of the Marshall Plan, through which the US had given Europe the means to rebuild its shattered economies, and to re-establish the institutions of democracy.AFP via Getty Images'I was born 15 years after the Second World War in a world America made,' Allan Little told an audience. 'The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement'I told the audience, composed mostly of students of journalism, that as a young reporter I had myself witnessed the inspiring culmination of all this in 1989 when I'd stood in Wenceslas Square in Prague. Back then I'd watched, awestruck, as Czechs and Slovaks demanded an end to Soviet occupation, and to a hated Communist dictatorship, so that they too could be part of the community of nations that we called, simply, \"the West\", bound together by shared values, at the head of which sat the the United States of America.I looked up from my notes at the faces of the audience. Near the front of the lecture hall sat a young man. He looked about 20. Tears were running down his face and he was quietly trying to suppress a sob.At a drinks reception afterwards he approached me. \"I'm sorry I lost it in there,\" he said. \"Your words: right now we are feeling raw and vulnerable. America needs to hear this stuff from its foreign friends.\"In that moment I thought how lucky my generation - and his - had been, to be alive in an era in which the international system was regulated by rules - a world that had turned its back on the unconstrained power of the Great Powers.Getty ImagesDonald Trump believes the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too longBut it was the words of one of his classmates that come back to me now. He had arrived in New York just a few days before 9/11 from his native Pakistan to study at Columbia. He likened the US to Imperial Rome.\"If you are lucky enough to live within the walls of the imperial citadel, which is to say here in the US, you experience American power as something benign. It protects you and your property. It bestows freedom by upholding the rule of law. It is accountable to the people through democratic institutions.\"But if, like me, you live on the barbarian fringes of Empire, you experience American power as something quite different. It can do anything to you, with impunity... And you can't stop it or hold it to account.\"His words made me consider the much heralded rules-based international order from another angle: from the point of view of much of the Global South. And how its benefits have never been universally distributed, something that the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reminded an audience at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, last week.ReutersCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech in Davos called for 'the middle powers' to act together\"We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false,\" Carney said. \"That the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient. That trade rules were enforced asymmetrically. And we knew that international law applied with varying rigour depending on the identity of the accused or victim.\"Back in Columbia University, all those years ago, the student from Pakistan had asked me a question. \"Don't you find it interesting,\" he said, \"that the US, the country that came into existence in a revolt against the arbitrary exercise of [British] power is, in our day, the most powerful exponent of arbitrary power?\"A new world order or back to the future?Donald Trump came to Davos last week clearly determined to bend the Europeans to his will over Greenland. He wanted ownership, he said.He declared that Denmark had only \"added one more dog sled\" to defend the territory. That speaks volumes to the undisguised contempt with which he and many in his inner circle appear to hold certain European allies.\"I fully share your loathing of European freeloading,\" Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told a group on messaging app Signal that included Vice-President JD Vance last year, adding \"PATHETIC\". (He hadn't realised that the Editor of The Atlantic magazine had apparently been added to the group chat.)Then President Trump himself told Fox News recently that, during the war in Afghanistan, Nato had sent \"some troops\" but that they had \"stayed a little back, a little off the front lines\".The comments provoked anger among UK politicians and veterans' families. The UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer branded Trump's remarks \"insulting and frankly appalling\".The UK prime minister spoke to Trump on Saturday, after which the US president used his Truth Social platform to praise UK troops as being \"among the greatest of all warriors\".Carl Court - Pool/Getty ImagesSir Keir Starmer said US President Donald Trump's remarks about Nato troops in Afghanistan were 'insulting and frankly appalling'We know from the White House's National Security Strategy, published in December, that in his second term, Trump intends to unshackle the US from the system of transnational bodies created, in part by Washington, to regulate international affairs. That document spells out the means by which the US will put \"America First\" at the heart of US security strategy by using whatever powers they have - ranging from economic sanctions and trade tariffs to military intervention - to bend smaller and weaker nations into alignment with US interests.It is a strategy which privileges strength - a return to a world in which the Great Powers carve out spheres of influence.The danger in this for what Canada's prime minister called \"the middle powers\" is clear. \"If you're not at the table,\" he said, \"you're on the menu.\"Re-interpretation of the Monroe DoctrineIn Davos last week, America's allies, especially Canada and Europe, were laying to rest what is now commonly called the rules-based international order, and in some cases mourning its demise.But, as the young Pakistani student at Columbia journalism school argued all those years ago, to large parts of the rest of the world it has not seemed, in the last 80 years, that the US, and on occasions some of its friends, felt restrained by rules.More from InDepth\"After World War Two, we saw, under the so-called rules-based international order multiple interventions by the United States in Latin America,\" says Dr Christopher Sabatini, Senior Research Fellow for Latin America at Chatham House think tank in London.\"It's not new. There are patterns of intervention that go all the way back to 1823. There's a term I use for American policymakers who advocate for unilateral US intervention. I call them \"backyard-istas\" - those who see Latin America as their backyard.\"In 1953, the CIA, assisted by the British Secret Intelligence Services, orchestrated a coup that overthrew the government of Mohammad Mossadeq in Iran. He had wanted to audit the books of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later part of BP), and when it refused to co-operate, Mossadeq threatened to nationalise it.For posing a threat to British economic interests, he was overthrown and Britain and the US threw their weight behind the increasingly dictatorial shah.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesThe CIA played a key role in the 1953 coup which ousted Iran's democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammad MossadeqAt the same time, the US was conspiring to overthrow the elected government of Guatemala, which had implemented an ambitious programme of land reform that threatened to harm the profitability of the American United Fruit Company. Again with active CIA collusion, the left-wing President Jacobo Arbenz was toppled and replaced by a series of US-backed authoritarian rulers.In 1983 the US invaded the Caribbean island of Grenada, after a Marxist coup. This was a country of which the late Queen, Elizabeth II, was head of state.And the US invaded Panama in 1989, and arrested the military leader Manuel Noriega. He spent all but the last few months of his life in prison.These interventions were all functions of the Monroe Doctrine, first promulgated by President James Monroe in 1823. It asserted America's right to dominate the Western hemisphere and keep European powers from trying to meddle in the newly independent states of Latin America. The post-war rules-based international order did not deter the US from imposing its will on weaker neighbours.Getty Images / CorbisPanama's leader Manuel Noriega was forcibly removed by US troops in 1989 and spent almost all of the rest of his life in jailWhen it was announced by the fifth president of the US, James Monroe, the doctrine that bears his name was widely seen as an expression of US solidarity with its neighbours, a strategy to protect them from attempts by the European great powers to recolonise them. The US, after all, shared with them a set of republican values and a history of anti-colonial struggle.But the doctrine quickly became an assertion of Washington's right to dominate its neighbours and use any means, up to and including military intervention, to bend their policies into alignment with American interests. President Theodore Roosevelt, in 1904, said it gave the US \"international police power\" to intervene in countries where there was \"wrongdoing\".So could it be that President Trump's re-interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine is simply part of a continuum in US foreign policy?Getty ImagesThe Monroe Doctrine was first promulgated by US President James Monroe (pictured) in 1823\"The Guatemala coup, in 1954 - that was entirely owned by the US. They orchestrated the entire takeover of the country,\" says Christopher Sabatini.The 1973 coup in Chile against left-wing Prime Minister Salvador Allende \"wasn't orchestrated by the CIA but the United States said it would accept a coup\", he added.During the Cold War, the main motivation for intervention was the perception that Soviet-backed parties were gaining ground domestically, representing Communist advances into the Western hemisphere. In our own day, the perceived enemy is no longer Communism, but drug-trafficking and migration.That difference aside, President Trump's reassertion of the Monroe Doctrine \"absolutely is 'back to the future',\" says the historian Jay Sexton, author of The Monroe Doctrine: Empire and Nation in Nineteenth Century America.Getty ImagesGuatamalan President Jacobo Arbenz was overthrown by a US-backed coup in 1954\"The other thing that gives Trump's United States a 19th-Century feel is his unpredictability, his volatility. Observers could never really predict what the US would do next.\"We don't know what the future holds but we do known from even a cursory look at modern history, from 1815 onwards [the end of the Napoleonic wars], that Great Power rivalries are really destabilising. They lead to conflict.\"Cohesion among the alliesAmerican unilateralism may not be new. What is new is that this time, it is America's friends and allies that find themselves on the receiving end of American power.Suddenly, Europeans and Canadians are getting a taste of something long familiar to other parts of the world - that arbitrary exercise of US power that the young Pakistani journalism student articulated so clearly to me in the weeks after 9/11.For the first year of his second term, European leaders used flattery in their approach to Trump. Starmer, for example, had King Charles invite him to make a second state visit to the UK, an honour no other US president in history has been granted. The Secretary-General of Nato, Mark Rutte, referred to him, bizarrely, as \"daddy\".Getty ImagesKing Charles invited Donald Trump to make a second state visit to the UK - an honour no other US president has received (photo from first state visit in 2019)But Trump's approach towards Europe brought him clear success. Previous presidents, including Barack Obama and Joe Biden, also believed European allies were not pulling their weight in Nato - the collective trans-Atlantic defence alliance - and wanted them to spend more on their own security. Only Trump succeeded in making them act. In response to his threats, they agreed to raise their defence spending from around 2% of GDP to 5%, something unthinkable even a year ago.Greenland, however, seems to have been a game-changer. When Trump threatened Danish sovereignty in Greenland, the allies began to cohere around a new-found defiance, and resolved not, this time, to bend.Canada's prime minister gave voice to this moment. In his pivotal speech in Davos Mark Carney said this was a moment of \"rupture\" with the old rules-based international order - in the new world of Great Power politics, \"the middle powers\" needed to act together.Getty ImagesPrevious US presidents had also believed the European allies should spend more on their own security - only Trump succeeded in making them actIt is rare, at Davos, for an audience to rise to its feet and award a speaker with a standing ovation. But they did it for Carney, and you felt, in that moment, a cohesion forming among the allies.And in an instant, the threat of tariffs lifted. Trump has gained nothing over Greenland that the US hasn't already had for decades - the right, with Denmark's blessing, to build military bases, stage unlimited personnel there, and even to mineral exploitation.The challenge facing 'middle powers' todayThere is no doubt that Trump's America-First strategy is popular with his Maga base. They share his view that the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too long. And European leaders, in agreeing to increase their defence spending, have accepted that President Trump was right: that the imbalance was no longer fair or sustainable.ReutersIn June 2004 I reported on the celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy. There were still many living World War Two veterans and thousands of those who had crossed the Channel 60 years earlier came back to the beaches that day - many of them from the US.They wanted no talk of the heroism or courage of their youth. We watched them go one by one or in little groups to the cemeteries to find the graves of the young men they'd known and whom they'd left behind in the soil of liberated France.We watched the allied heads of government pay tribute to those old men. But I found myself thinking not so much of the battles they'd fought and the bravery and sacrifices of their younger selves, but of the peace that they'd gone home to build when the fighting was over.The world they bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents. For they were born into a world of Great Power rivalries, in which, in Mark Carney's words, \"the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must\".This was the generation that went home to build the rules-based international order, because they had learned the hard way what a system without rules, without laws, can lead to. They wanted no going back to that.ShutterstockThe world the veterans bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents, writes Allan LittleThose born in the decades after the war may have made the mistake of believing that the world could never go back to that.And 24 years ago, as I gave my talk in a New York City still traumatised by 9/11, did I, too, make the mistake of thinking the post-World War Two order, underpinned, as it was, by American might, was the new permanent normal? I think I did.For we did not foresee then a world in which trust in traditional sources of news and information would be corroded by a rising cynicism, turbo-charged by social media and, increasingly now, artificial intelligence.In any age of economic stagnation and extremes of inequality, popular trust in democratic institutions corrodes. It has been corroding not just in the US but across the Western world for decades now. As such Trump may be a symptom, not a cause, of Carney's \"rupture\" with the post-World War Two order.Watching those old men making their way through the Normandy cemeteries was a graphic and poignant reminder that democracy, the rule of law, accountable government are not naturally occurring phenomena.  They are not even, historically speaking, normal. They have to be fought for, built, sustained, defended.And that is the challenge from here facing what Mark Carney called \"the middle powers\".Top picture credit: AFP/ReutersBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "18 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentReggae legend Sly Dunbar, who played with everyone from Bob Marley to The Rolling Stones, has died at the age of 73.One of the genre's most revered drummers, he played on tracks such as Bob Marley's Punky Reggae Party and Dave and Ansell Collins' classic, Double Barrel.However, he was better known as half of the production team Sly & Robbie - who produced groundbreaking hits for everyone from Peter Tosh and Black Uhuru, to non-reggae acts like Bob Dylan, Grace Jones and Ian Dury.Dunbar's death was first reported by his wife, Thelma, who told the Jamaican newspaper The Gleaner she had found him unresponsive on Monday morning. The musician's agent and publicist confirmed the news to the BBC. Born Lowell Fillmore Dunbar in Kingston, Jamaica, he started out playing on tin cans, after watching Lloyd Knibbs and the Skatalites on television.\"I saw [Knibbs] playing and I thought, 'I want to be a drummer' because he's the hardest worker in the band,\" he said in a 1997 interview.\"He's my idol! In some ways, I'm self-taught but I got a lot of help from other drummers by watching them play.\"In his teens, Dunbar met bassist Robbie Shakespeare and formed the rhythm section of the Revolutionaries, who became regular session musicians at the famed Channel One recording studio.Their sound differed from the melody-rich music of Bob Marley, with a heavier emphasis on the beat - including the pioneering \"rockers\" rhythm, which introduced more syncopation and energy to the music.They spent the 1970s working with major reggae acts like Gregory Isaacs, Dennis Brown and Barrington Levy, while touring the US with Peter Tosh.According to legend, the duo lived on bread and water in that period, hoping to save enough money to start their own production company.Taxi Records was duly founded in 1980, and nurtured a new generation of Jamaican artists such as Shaggy, Shabba Ranks, Skip Marley, Beenie Man and Red Dragon.Around the same time, they provided the thunderous beats on Grace Jones's hit 1981 album Nightclubbing, which opened the doors for them to work with some of rock and pop's greatest - from Dylan and Joe Cocker, to singers like Marianne Faithfull, Madonna and Sinead O'Connor.At home, they earned a reputation for updating the sound of reggae by incorporating more electronic instruments and textures.Later on, they developed a bright and melodic take on dancehall with the duo Chaka Demus & Pliers, scoring hits with songs such as Tease Me and Murder She Wrote in the early 1990s.At one point, Shakespeare (who died in 2021) estimated that he and Dunbar had taken part in more than 200,000 recordings, either their own or as backup musicians or producers for other artists.\"When you buy a reggae record, there's a 90% chance the drummer is Sly Dunbar,\" producer Brian Eno told the New Music New York festival in 1979. \"You get the impression that Sly Dunbar is chained to a studio seat somewhere in Jamaica, but in fact what happens is that his drum tracks are so interesting, they get used again and again.\"Dunbar's wife said she had found him unresponsive in bed at around 07:00 on Monday, 26 January.\"I went to wake him up and he wasn't responding, I called the doctor and that was the news,\" she said. An exact cause of death was not given, though Dunbar had reportedly been ill for some time.\"Yesterday was such a good day for him,\" Thelma told Jamaica's Gleaner newspaper. \"He had friends come over to visit him and we all had such a good time. He ate well yesterday... sometimes he's not into food. I knew he was sick... but I didn't know that he was this sick.\"Among those paying tribute was British DJ David Rodigan, who called Dunbar a \"true icon\" and \"one of the greatest drummers of all time\".",

    "body": "A Tokyo court has asked Pyongyang to pay 88 million Japanese yen ($570,000; £416,000) to four people who were lured to North Korea decades ago by a propaganda scheme.The plaintiffs said the North was marketed to them as \"paradise on Earth\", but they instead found themselves subject to harsh conditions, including forced labour. They later escaped. Monday's ruling is largely symbolic with no real way to enforce it: North Korea has for years ignored the lawsuit, and its leader Kim Jong Un has not responded to Japanese court summons.But the ruling, which comes after a years-long legal battle in Japanese courts, has been hailed by the plaintiffs' lawyer as \"historic\".This was the first time \"a Japanese court exercised its sovereignty against North Korea to recognise its malpractice\", said Atsushi Shiraki, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, AFP reported.More than 90,000 Zainichi Koreans - ethnic Koreans who live in Japan - moved to North Korea between 1959 and 1984, under a resettlement scheme which promised an idyllic life of free healthcare, education and jobs. But instead survivors say they found themselves forced to work on farms and factories, subject to restrictions and could not leave.One of the plaintiffs, Eiko Kawasaki, went to North Korea in 1960, when she was 17. She escaped in 2003 and is now 83 years old.She was among a group of five plaintiffs who filed a lawsuit in 2018 demanding compensation. Two of the original plaintiffs have since died, but one of them continued to be represented in the lawsuit by their family.In 2022, a Tokyo district court rejected their compensation claims, saying that it fell outside Japanese jurisdiction and the statute of limitations had expired.But in 2023, the Tokyo High Court ruled that the case was in fact under Japanese jurisdiction and found that North Korea had violated the plaintiffs' rights.\"It's not an overstatement to say most of their lives were ruined by North Korea,\" judge Taiichi Kamino said at a ruling at the Tokyo District Court on Monday,  according to an Associated Press report. Kenji Fukuda, another lawyer for the plaintiffs acknowledged the significance of the ruling but said it would be a \"challenge\" actually getting any money from North Korea. ",

    "body": "Sweden is moving forward with plans to lower the age of criminal responsibility from 15 to 13 in serious cases as it grapples with a growing number of children recruited into gangs to carry out violent crimes without facing serious legal repercussions.Justice Minister Gunnar Strommer said the country was in an \"emergency situation\" and stopping the use of children in criminal networks was a \"crucial task\" for the government.But several authorities, including police, prison officials and prosecutors, have opposed the plan, with some worried that it may lead to even younger children becoming offenders.If passed, the legislation will go into force as early as this summer.Strommer insisted that the proposal did not amount to a \"general lowering of the age of criminal responsibility\" and would only apply to the \"most serious crimes\" such as murder, attempted murder, aggravated bombings, aggravated weapons offences and aggravated rape.Under the proposal, some of these offenders could face prison sentences in certain cases.Data from the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention shows that the number of registered offences linked to suspects under the age of 15 has doubled over the past decade.The current government came into power in 2022 vowing to crack down on organised crime.At the beginning of last year, a government-ordered inquiry recommended lowering the age of criminal responsibility to 14 in serious cases.Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson confirmed in September that it would be lowered from 15, saying children are \"being ruthlessly exploited by criminal networks to commit serious crimes\".\"Both to protect these children and their potential victims, the government is taking strong action against this type of cynical exploitation,\" he added.The government then announced that it would seek to lower it to 13, and sent out the bill for input from 126 authorities and organisations.Their plans were met with criticism and opposition from different authorities and organisations.In November, the police authority said that the change risked \"significantly younger children\" getting involved in criminal gangs as a result.Other groups said the prison system was not equipped to handle such young offenders and detaining them could breach children's rights.The prison and probation service also said the move could lead to negative consequences for children and that they should be cared for in \"other ways\".Ministers had also previously considered imposing age limits on social media, with police arguing that gangs had used certain platforms to recruit young children into crime.Strommer said on Monday that he had taken note of the previous criticism of the bill, but that the situation had become more urgent.However opposition has not abated. Fredrik Hjulström, a local authority head who is reviewing the proposal, said it contained \"no factual arguments\", according to Swedish national broadcaster SVT.He added that children should receive care rather than being punished and argued that the bill was about scoring political points, with the country's general election coming up in September this year.Meanwhile lawyer Johan Eriksson agreed that action must be taken to prevent children from being recruited by gangs, but said lowering the age of criminal responsibility would likely have the opposite effect.The bill will be sent to Sweden's Council on Legislation, which reviews bills the government intends to put before parliament.",

    "body": "Judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) have ruled that former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte is fit to attend pre-trial proceedings for alleged crimes against humanity.The ICC also will hold a hearing on 23 February to decide whether the prosecution's case against Duterte is strong enough to proceed to a trial.Duterte's lawyers earlier argued that the 80-year-old was unfit to participate in the ICC proceedings citing \"cognitive impairment\". He has been detained at the Hague since March 2025.He is accused of being responsible for dozens of murders under his so-called war on drugs, during which thousands of small-time drug dealers, users and others were killed without trial.Duterte was president of the Philippines from 2016 to 2022. He justified his war on drugs by saying peace and order would pave the way for economic development.Citing opinions from a panel of medical experts, ICC judges said they were \"satisfied\" that Duterte is \"able effectively to exercise his procedural rights and is therefore fit to take part in the pre-trial proceedings\".ICC judges also said in their decision on Monday that the mental capacities needed to \"meaningfully exercise one's procedural and fair trial rights\" did not have to be \"at their notionally highest level\".\"This ruling tells victims that in the reckoning of Duterte at the ICC, their voices will not be sidelined by technical evasions,\" said Congresswoman Leila de Lima, one of Duterte's fiercest critics who was jailed during his presidency on drug charges that were later found to be false.Duterte was arrested at Manila airport in March 2025 as his family's alliance with his successor, President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr crumbled.His arrest has divided Filipinos. While his deadly drugs crackdown has drawn sharp criticism from civil society, his populist message resonates with those who feel sidelined by Manila's political elite.In May last year, Duterte was elected mayor of Davao city despite being in prison. His daughter, Vice-President Sara Duterte, is also widely expected to run for president in the 2028 elections, where Marcos is ineligible to seek a second term.",

    "body": "2 hours agoAyeshea PereraAsia Digital EditorReutersFire officials warn that the situation is changing rapidlyFirefighters in the Australian state of Victoria are battling at least six major fires as a record-breaking heatwave hits the country's south-east. Two fires are currently burning at \"emergency level\" according to local broadcaster ABC News. Several communities have been issued emergency warnings to either evacuate, watch and wait, or shelter in place. Fire officials warn that the situation is changing rapidly and have asked locals to stay up to date with the latest warnings.The Bureau of Meteorology says that parts of the state have seen all-time temperature highs - with one area hitting a high of 48.9C. Melbourne has recorded a temperature of 41C. Chris Hardman, the chief fire officer at Forest Fire Management Victoria, had told reporters that the state's heat conditions were making conditions \"incredibly difficult\" for firefighters.Two fires - in Camperdown and Otways - are burning at emergency level. A new fire in the Larralea area is also causing \"significant concern\". Country Fire Authority (CFA) chief officer Jason Hefferman told ABC Radio that there was a danger that the Otways fire could produce ember showers \"which can create more fires in front of the main fire\". It is unclear what damage has been caused by the fires, but Australia's Deputy Incident Controller Alistair Drayton, said he had \"anecdotal evidence\" that some homes had been lost. He also praised the \"spectacular\" work done by firefighters so far. Apart from Victoria, where there is a total fire ban, South Australia has also been placed under alert for \"extreme\" fire risk.Meanhwile health officials have warned that the prolonged heat carries significant health risks. The elderly, children and people with underlying health conditions are most at risk,  Victoria chief health officer Caroline McElnay told reporters.\"It can cause potentially fatal health problems such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke but it can also trigger events like heart attacks or stroke.\"Scientists are clear that human-caused climate change is making heatwaves much more likely and more intense globally.And Australasia has seen an increasing frequency and severity of heat extremes in recent decades, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).South-east Australia also experienced extreme heat in early January, with temperatures surpassing 40C. A rapid study by scientists at the World Weather Attribution group estimated that the high temperatures across a three-day period were now at least five times more likely as a result of climate change.While fires occur naturally in Australia, these hot, dry conditions can make it much easier for fires to spread, potentially fuelling larger blazes.And as the world continues to warm, Australia is expected to see further increases in these \"fire weather\" conditions, according to the IPCC.Additional reporting by Mark Poynting",

    "body": "A frowning horse plush has become a viral bestseller ahead of Lunar New Year celebrations for the year of the horse in China.The sad-looking soft toy was originally made in error after a worker sewed a smile on the horse upside down, the owner of Happy Sister - a shop in the eastern city of Yiwu - told Reuters news agency.Zhang Huoqing had expected to have to issue a refund to the customer who bought the toy, but after an image of it started circulating online the horse began selling out.Zhang said the animal's gloomy expression was resonating with young workers in China.\"A lot of customers like it, and they said it makes sense: that it suits the spirit of today's corporate slaves,\" Zhang said.\"This crying horse really fits the reality of modern working people,\" she added.\"People joked that the crying horse is how you look at work, while the smiling one is how you look after work.\"Zhang's factory has surged production to meet demand - including from other countries, according to media reports.One buyer, known online as Tuan Tuan Mami, was quoted by the South China Morning Post as saying: \"This little horse looks so sad and pitiful, just like the way I feel at work.\"With this crying toy in the Year of the Horse, I hope to leave all my grievances at work behind and keep only happiness.\"The newspaper says the horse is about 20cm (7.8in) tall and costs 25 yuan (£2.62). It is red for good luck, with a golden collar and bell around its neck, and has the phrase \"money comes quickly\" embroidered on its body in golden letters.Another shop owner in Yiwu, Lou Zhenxian, told Reuters she thought the toy was ugly, but \"it's the kind of emotional value young people look for these days\".She described young people going to work in the kind of state like the crying horse, and when you get off work \"being immediately happy\".\"But actually if everyone chases that kind of sentiment, the young people's way of thinking, it's not quite right. I believe you should work hard when at work and be happy after work, it shouldn't be two extreme opposites,\" she said.Lunar New Year will be celebrated in February to usher in the year of the horse - one of 12 animals repeated in a cycle under the Chinese zodiac calendar.

    "body": "Nipah virus outbreak in India triggers Asia airport screenings8 hours agoKelly NgEPAThe Nipah virus can spread from animals to humans.An outbreak of the deadly Nipah virus in India's West Bengal state has sparked concern in parts of Asia, with some tightening screening measures at airports.Thailand has started screening passengers at three airports that receive flights from West Bengal. Nepal has also begun screening arrivals at Kathmandu airport and other land border points with India.Five healthcare workers in West Bengal were infected by the virus early this month, one of whom is in a critical condition. Some 110 people who were in contact with them have been quarantined.The virus can spread from animals to humans. It has a high death range – ranging from 40% to 75% – as there is no vaccine or medicine to treat it.What is the Nipah virus and what are its symptoms?The Nipah virus can be transmitted from animals, like pigs and fruit bats, to humans. It can also  spread person-to-person through contaminated food.The World Health Organization has described Nipah in its top ten priority diseases, along with pathogens like Covid-19 and Zika, because of its potential to trigger an epidemic.The incubation period ranges from four to 14 days.People who contract the virus show a wide range of symptoms, or sometimes, none at all.Initial symptoms may include fever, headaches, muscle pain, vomiting and sore throat. In some people, these may be followed by drowsiness, altered consciousness, and pneumonia.Encephalitis, a sometimes-fatal condition that causes inflammation of the brain, may occur in severe cases.To date, no drugs of vaccines have been approved to treat the disease. Where were the past outbreaks?The first recognised Nipah outbreak was in 1998 among pig farmers in Malaysia and later spread to neighbouring Singapore. The virus got its name from the village where it was first discovered.More than 100 people were killed and a million pigs culled in an effort to contain the virus. It also resulted in significant economic losses for farmers and those in the livestock trade.Bangladesh has borne the brunt in recent years, with more than 100 people dying of Nipah since 2001.The virus has also been detected in India. Outbreaks were reported in West Bengal in 2001 and 2007. More recently, the southern state of Kerala has been a Nipah hotspot. In 2018, 19 cases were reported of which 17 were fatal; and in 2023, two out of six confirmed cases later died.What is happening now?At least five confirmed cases were reported as of last week, all of whom were linked to a private hospital in Barasat. Two nurses are being treated in an intensive coronary care unit, one of whom remains in \"very critical\" condition, local media reported citing the state's health department.No cases have yet been reported outside India, but several countries are stepping up precautions. On Sunday, Thailand started screening passengers at three international airports in Bangkok and Phuket that receive flights from West Bengal. Passengers from these flights have been asked to make health declarations.The parks and wildlife department has also implemented stricter screenings in natural tourist attractions.Jurai Wongswasdi, a spokeswoman for the Department for Disease Control, told BBC Thai authorities are \"fairly confident\" about guarding against an outbreak in Thailand. Nepal, too, has begun screening people arriving through the airport in Kathmandu and other land border points with India.Meanwhile, health authorities in Taiwan have proposed to list the Nipah virus as a \"Category 5 disease\". Under the island's system, diseases classified as Category 5 are emerging or rare infections with major public health risks, that require immediate reporting and special control measures.Additional reporting by BBC Thai",

    "body": "Technology giant Meta is set to trial premium subscriptions for Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp users in the coming months in its latest experiment with paid services.The new offerings would give access to features including expanded artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.Under the plan, access to the platforms' core services would remain free to use.The firm also plans to test subscriptions for features, such as its Vibes video generation app, which Meta says \"can bring your ideas to life with new AI visual creation tools\".The company announced Vibes in September as part of the latest version of the Meta AI app.It also aims to use Manus, a Chinese-founded AI firm it agreed to buy in December for a reported $2bn (£1.46bn), in its subscription plans, according to TechCrunch, which first reported the story.Meta will also continue to offer standalone Manus subscriptions to businesses.At the time, the firm said the deal would help improve its own AI by giving people access to \"agents\" - tools which can do complex things with minimal user interaction such as planning trips or making presentations.\"Manus's exceptional talent will join Meta's team to deliver general-purpose agents across our consumer and business products, including Meta AI,\" it said in a blog post.Based in Singapore after relocating from China, Manus has sought to set itself apart from rival AI developers with what it claims can be a \"truly autonomous\" agent.Unlike many chatbots which need to be repeatedly asked for things before a user can get their desired response, Manus says its service can plan, execute and complete tasks independently in accordance with instructions.In January, Beijing said it would investigate the Meta deal to assess whether it broke China's technology export laws or national security regulations.Last year, Facebook tested placing a limit on how many links some users can share when they post on the social media platform.Notifications seen by some users based in the UK and US said they could only share a certain number of links in Facebook posts without a subscription.The company described it as \"a limited test to understand whether the ability to publish an increased volume of posts with links adds additional value\" for subscribers.In late January, people in the UK were notified of a £2.99 monthly subscription to access ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram.Following an announcement in September, UK Facebook and Instagram users will be prompted to choose between paying, or continuing to use the apps for free with personalised ads. EU users have a fee of €5.99 (£5) a month for the same service.In 2023, Meta started to roll out a paid verification service that gives Facebook and Instagram users a blue tick for a monthly fee.",

    "body": "6 hours agoDearbail JordanandPeter HoskinsUS President Donald Trump has announced he is raising tariffs on South Korean imports to 25% after accusing Seoul of \"not living up\" to a trade deal reached last year.In a post on social media, Trump said he would increase levies on South Korea from 15% across a range of products including automobiles, lumber, pharmaceuticals and \"all other Reciprocal TARIFFS\".Trump said South Korean lawmakers have been slow to approve the deal while \"we have acted swiftly to reduce our TARIFFS in line with the Transaction agreed to\".South Korea said it had not been given official notice of the decision to raise tariffs on some of its goods, and wanted urgent talks with Washington over the issue.It added that South Korea's Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan, who is currently in Canada, will visit Washington as soon as possible to meet US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.South Korea exported goods worth about $123bn (£90bn) to the US last year, making it the second largest export market after China. Of these, car exports accounted for about $30bn.Initially, shares in Korean carmakers Hyundai and Kai fell by up to 6% in response to Trump's announcement, but they then recovered to close only about 1% lower.South Korea's benchmark Kospi stock index also reversed early losses to end the day up 2.7%.Analysts said investors were sceptical whether the threatened tariff rise would go ahead, pointing to Trump's recent U‑turn on imposing extra tariffs on European trade partners over opposition to US plans to acquire Greenland.\"With a delegation on its way from Seoul to Washington, markets are viewing this latest twist as more carrot than stick,\" said Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown.Seoul and Washington reached a deal last October, which included a pledge from South Korea to invest $350bn (£256bn) in the US, some of which would go to shipbuilding.The following month, the two countries agreed that the US would reduce tariffs on some products once South Korea started the process to approve the deal.The agreement was submitted to South Korea's National Assembly on 26 November and is currently being reviewed. It is likely to be passed in February, according to local media.Tariffs are paid by companies who import products. In this case, US firms will pay a 25% tax on goods they buy from South Korea.Trump has frequently used tariffs as leverage to enact foreign policy during his second term in the White House.On Saturday, he threatened Canada with a 100% tariff if it struck a trade deal with China.On Monday, Chinese officials said its \"strategic partnership\" agreement with Canada is not meant to undercut other countries.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said his country was not pursuing a free trade deal with China and has \"never\" considered it.He added that Canadian officials have made their position clear to their American counterparts.Before that, Trump said he would impose import taxes on eight countries - including the UK - who opposed US plans to seize Greenland, an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark which is a member of Nato.He later backed down from the tariff threat over Greenland citing progress towards a \"future deal\" over the island, but the episode strained US relations with Denmark and other Nato allies.

    "body": "19 hours agoMerlyn Thomas,BBC VerifyandShayan Sardarizadeh,BBC VerifyVerified videos emerging from Iran show bodies piled up in a hospital, snipers stationed on buildings and CCTV cameras being destroyed, following the unprecedented crackdown on protests earlier this month.BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they first erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the state's deadly crackdown on protesters.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has confirmed the killing of nearly 6,000 people, including 5,633 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December. It says it is also currently investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks.Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people were killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".The latest videos to emerge from the country are understood to have been filmed on 8 and 9 January, when thousands of people took to the streets following a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah.They are thought to be the deadliest nights for protesters so far and these newly verified videos show how Iran's security forces have been violently cracking down on protesters.Multiple clips analysed by BBC Verify and BBC Persian show bodies piled up inside a mortuary at Tehranpars hospital in east Tehran. We verified the location of the hospital by matching its interior to other publicly available images and videos of the building, and counted at least 31 bodies in just one video. Another clip shows seven body bags laid on the ground outside the hospital's entrance.Hundreds of people are seen protesting on a highway in west Tehran in another video before multiple rounds of gunfire can be heard and people begin to scream. Protesters have also been seen trying to evade Iran's heavy surveillance infrastructure by disabling CCTV cameras. Footage we verified shows one person in the capital climbing up a post and hitting a surveillance camera several times in an attempt to disable it. A huge crowd of protesters can be seen on the ground and heard cheering as the camera is damaged.We have tracked the spread of the anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely far higher.In the south-eastern city of Kerman a video taken from high up in a building shows several armed men in military uniform walking down a road firing their weapons continuously, though it is not clear who they are shooting at. A small fire burns in the middle of the road while the sound of protesters chanting can be heard in the background.Snipers have also been recorded on the roofs of buildings. In the north-eastern city of Mashhad verified video shows two men dressed in black on a rooftop of a building in daylight. One man is standing next to a large rifle that is leant against a wall and speaking on the phone. The other man crouches on the floor while smoking.For most people there has been an almost-total internet blackout since 8 January, but some have managed to briefly access the internet using methods such as SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet and virtual private networks (VPNs).More videos are likely to emerge in the coming days as the country's economy has struggled during the blackout.Additional reporting BBC Persian.",

    "body": "3 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorRoberto Schmidt/GettyThe images emanating from Minneapolis have shocked ItaliansThe US immigration agency whose officers have been involved in two fatal shootings in Minneapolis has said it is sending agents to help support American security operations during the Winter Olympics, which start in Italy on 6 February.Confirmation of the agency's role came from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), after reports prompted alarm and anger in Italy.\"This is a militia that kills... of course they're not welcome in Milan,\" the city's mayor, Beppe Sala, told Italian radio on Tuesday.An ICE spokesperson stressed that \"all security operations remain under Italian authority\".US embassy sources in Rome had already explained to Italian media that various federal agencies had worked at previous Games in the past, although it was not clear if the customs and enforcement agency had itself taken part.The agency's statement on Tuesday explained that \"ICE's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is supporting the US Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service and host nation to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organisations\".It would \"obviously\" not conduct immigration enforcement operations outside the US, it said.Piero CRUCIATTI/AFPItalian troops in Milan - the Winter Olympics at Milan-Cortina take place from 6-22 FebruaryItaly's Interior Minister Matteo Pantedosi had initially appeared unaware that US immigration officials would be coming to the Milan-Cortina Olympics and said even if they were, foreign delegations could choose their own security, saying: \"I don't see what the problem is and it's very normal.\"But as shock at the images emanating from Minneapolis grew, so did the outcry in Italy that officers from the same US federal agency could appear on Italian streets.In the aftermath of Alex Pretti being shot on the streets of Minneapolis by federal agents on Saturday morning, two journalists for Italian public broadcaster Rai were threatened by ICE officials as the reporters drove around the city covering the agency's actions.The Rai TV report showed one agent warned the crew that if they kept filming the agents, their car window would be smashed.The governor of Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, sought to calm the situation, suggesting that ICE agents would be deployed in Italy to protect US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.Political opponents of right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, such as Five Star Senator Barbara Floridia, warned that continued government silence on the issue would provide \"yet more evidence of cowardice and subservience towards Donald Trump\".The interior minister has since taken a stronger stand, maintaining on Monday that \"ICE will certainly not operate on Italian national territory\". The US had not communicated a list of security personnel, and security was guaranteed by the Italian state, he said.The centre-left mayor of Milan was unimpressed.\"I believe [ICE agents]shouldn't come to Italy because they don't guarantee they conform to our democratic way of ensuring security,\" Beppe Sala told RTL radio.",

    "body": "22 hours agoDan Johnson,JerusalemandRaffi BergThe Israeli military says it has retrieved the body of the last hostage in Gaza, paving the way for the next phase of US President Donald Trump's peace plan to get under way.It had been searching for Master Sgt Ran Gvili since the ceasefire with Hamas began in October.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Gvili's return \"an extraordinary achievement\".The Israeli military began searching a cemetery for Gvili on Sunday morning. Hamas's armed wing said it had provided mediators with \"all the details and information\" about Gvili's location.Netanyahu's office said Israel would reopen Gaza's key border crossing with Egypt once the operation to find and return Gvili was complete.The prime minister hailed the return of Gvili's body, saying: \"We promised - and I promised - to bring everyone back. We brought them all back, down to the very last captive,\" he said.The Israeli military said the clarification of existing intelligence over the weekend had enabled the search of the cemetery near Gaza City. A military official said the cemetery \"was located in the area of the Yellow Line\", the boundary to territory still controlled by Israeli forces under the ceasefire deal.Hamas said it had \"kept updating the mediators with the necessary information, which resulted in retrieving the body\".Spokesman Hazem Qassem said the discovery \"confirms Hamas's commitment to all the requirements of the ceasefire agreement\".In Israel, Itzik Gvili, the hostage's father, paid an emotional goodbye to his son in front of his coffin.\"You had the option to stay home, but you said to me: 'Father, I'm not going to leave my friends to fight alone.'\"You came out, and you need to see the honour you have here, all the people who brought you. All the police are here with you, the entire army is here with you, the entire nation is here with you. I'm proud of you, my son,\" Itzik Gvili said.Rani Gvili's sister Shira earlier told the Hostages and Missing Families Forum: \"I feel an insane sense of relief. I feel relieved. I am sad. I'm very sad that it ended this way, but it had to end at some point. I am so happy he's coming back home.\"The retrieval of Gvili may bring closure to his family and it finally ends Israel's hostage agony after 843 days.It also opens the way for further progress in Gaza's ceasefire deal. Israel had resisted moving forward until Gvili was found.Phase two is meant to involve the reconstruction and full demilitarisation of Gaza, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups. The plan is also meant to see the deployment of an as-yet unconstituted International Stabilization Force (ISF) and the progressive withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.On Friday, the Gvili family gathered in Tel Aviv's Hostages Square, as they had every week since he and the other 250 were abducted on 7 October 2023.\"I looked them in the eyes and said: 'We will bring Rani home',\" Netanyahu recounted on Monday. \"I promised you, citizens of Israel: We will bring everyone home.\"It is a promise finally delivered, and will be celebrated, but his critics say it has taken too long and cost too many lives - Israeli and Palestinian.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced Gvili's retrieval in a statement, saying: \"According to the information and intelligence available to us, Sgt Maj (res) Ran Gvili... a Yamam commando fighter, aged 24 at the time of his death, fell in battle on the morning of October 7, 2023, and his body was abducted to the Gaza Strip.\"The IDF shares in the family's grief. The IDF will continue to accompany the families and the returned hostages and to act to strengthen the security of Israel's citizens.\"With this, all of the hostages from the Gaza Strip area have been returned.\"Netanyahu said he sent soldiers into Gaza to return the hostages and defeat Hamas.Opening the Rafah border crossing is an important next step but other difficult issues have to be confronted.How will Hamas be disarmed and unpicked from the fabric of Gaza? When will Israel's army withdraw? And who will make up the international force delivering security for the future?This is the first time since 2014 there are no Israeli hostages, alive or dead, being held in Gaza - a reminder of the deep roots of this conflict and how difficult it could still be to shape a lasting peace.Reacting to the return of Gvili's body, Trump posted on Truth Social: \"Just recovered the last Hostage body in GAZA. Thus, got back ALL 20 of the living Hostages, and ALL of the Dead! AMAZING JOB!\"The president said \"most thought of it as an impossible thing to do\" and congratulated his \"great team of Champions\".Hamas was meant to return all hostages, alive and dead, within 72 hours of the ceasefire taking effect. The process took far longer, but eventually 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of 27 dead Israeli and foreign hostages were handed over, leaving only Gvili missing.The policeman was one of 251 hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed. Most of the hostages were released alive over the course of the next two years in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel's military campaign in Gaza, launched in response to the attack, has killed 71,660 Palestinians, the Hamas-run health ministry has said.",

    "body": "6 hours agoKayla EpsteinNew York CitySeveral people have died in a winter storm that hit a wide swathe of the US, causing thousands of flights to be cancelled or delayed due to severe conditions.The storm, which caused chaos from Texas to the tip of Maine over the weekend, snarled roadways, knocked out power, and buried major cities under a thick blanket of snow. Some areas in the north-east saw more than 20in (50.8cm) of snow during a 24-hour period, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Canadian officials also said the storm had seriously disrupted southern Ontario.In eastern Canada, snow is expected to continue in the Maritimes region on Tuesday, according to BBC Weather. Despite the storm easing away from the US, lake-effect snow showers are due to persist around the Great Lakes for the rest of the week.The coming days will remain very cold in central and eastern region of North America, and the situation is expected to intensify ahead of the weekend, when another significant winter storm could hit the eastern US.On Monday, more than 6,000 flights into, within or out of the US were cancelled, more than 7,000 were delayed, according to tracking website FlightAware.The severe weather also had a range of on-the-ground impacts, including in a number of southern US states. More than half a million users were without power in the early hours of Tuesday, according to PowerOutage.com. The worst-affected state is Tennessee, where the city of Nashville has experienced a deep freeze that plunged residents into cold and darkness.\"There are many trees down and power lines blocking the roads,\" Joy Flores, vice president of the Nashville Rescue Mission homeless shelter, told the BBC. Her centre was taking calls from residents who had lost power.The roads were icy and impossible to navigate, Flores said, and her home had \"no heating, no internet, and no coffee\".In Texas, a teenage girl died and another was in critical condition due to a sledding accident, the Frisco Police Department announced.In North Carolina, a man was found dead on the side of a highway in Buncombe County and authorities are investigating whether his death was weather-related. Louisiana's department of health said that two people had died due to hypothermia.Further north, a total of eight people died in New York City between Friday and Monday morning as temperatures plummeted, according to city officials, .The city's Central Park had registered 11.4in of snow as of Monday morning.Other deaths have been reported in Massachusetts, Kansas, Pennsylvania. As of Monday evening, at least 20 deaths had been linked to the cold temperatures and heavy snowfall, although in some cases officials said it was too early to determine the exact cause.In Canada, Ottawa and Quebec saw the heaviest impacts from the storm, leading to transport issues and multiple school closures.Toronto Pearson Airport received 18in of snowfall on Sunday, a new record for the site, according to the CBC.Relief may not come soon. According to the NWS, the \"potential is increasing\" for another winter storm beginning on Friday. Such an event could bring very cold temperatures across the eastern US, and \"widespread heavy precipitation\".The US weather agency cautioned that forecasters did not yet know the potential path of the storm or where it would have the most impact.Additional reporting by Gabriela Pomeroy.",

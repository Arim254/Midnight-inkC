    "body": "7 hours agoRobert GreenallandGabriela PomeroyTrent ErnstThe shootings have sent shock waves through the small townPeople in the small Canadian town of Tumbler Ridge have reacted with shock and disbelief after nine people were killed and at least 25 wounded in a shooting at a local secondary school and home. Members of the remote community, 415 miles (667 km) northeast of the western city of Vancouver, spoke of their fear and uncertainty during the school lockdown, as no-one appeared to be aware of the magnitude of what was unfolding. They described how close the community of just 2500 people was, and how devastated it would be by what had happened.\"I will know every victim. I've been here 19 years, and we're a small community,\" town mayor Darryl Krakowka told Canadian broadcaster CBC.\"I don't call them residents. I call them family,\" he added. Chris Norbury, a town councillor, was as close as anyone in Tumbler Ridge to the shooting. His wife teaches at the secondary school, his daughter attends the nearby elementary school and he works at the visitor centre just a block away.Speaking to the BBC World Service's Newsday programme, he explained how scared and anxious he felt as he waited for news of his wife.He first realised something was wrong when his daughter's school called him to say they were in lockdown. He was able to contact his wife, who was also under lockdown, but by the time he found out  - from an emergency alert - that there was an active shooter, he was unable to contact her again.\"We just had to speculate and jump into social media to see what was going on - there was a lot of speculation... but being who I am I just wanted to stay calm as best I could and wait for the facts,\" Norbury said.That proved far from easy, though.\"It was terrifying, it's hard to put into words the dread and the fear that you feel knowing that a loved one is in danger,\" he said.Meanwhile he was able to see emergency vehicles, including helicopters, coming and going from the school and a nearby medical centre.That feeling of helplessness and of not knowing what was happening was felt by those within the school too.Bryan Castellarin told the BBC his 15-year-old son Ashton was there while the shooting took place.Ashton and his friends were busy studying in their classroom when \"all of a sudden they heard gunshots going off,\" Castellarin said.\"They were huddled in a corner of the classroom for two to three hours. It felt a lot lot longer.Some of the students were \"really freaking out and crying,\" Bryan said. \"My son was trying to console them. He tried to stay as calm as he could, but he is pretty shaken up, and he is scared... He didn't know where the gunshots were coming from.\"Ashton told his dad it was a terrifying experience, and they didn't know what was going on. Luckily he was unharmed, but he is still waiting to hear information about some of his friends.\"I'm just so thankful that I didn't have to bury my kid,\" Bryan said.'Disturbing' photosDarian Quist, a grade 12 student at the school, was in a classroom with a teacher and about 15 students when the lockdown alarm sounded, though he believes he was in a different part of the school from the shooting. He and his classmates stayed there until the police escorted them out.\"For a while I didn't think anything was going on, but once everything was circulating and we realised something was wrong we got tables and barricaded the doors, and I believe we sat in there for two or two-and-a-half hours,\" he told CBC.He said everyone was tense and nervous. People sent him \"disturbing\" photos, he said, with \"blood and things like that\".\"I think that's when it all set in,\" he said.His mother Shelley Quist was working at the local hospital at the time. She said they only found out about the shooter half an hour after the lockdown - though she was on the phone with her son the whole time.\"It's just one of those things when you just think it's never going to happen,\" she said, adding: \"Panic was setting in until I laid eyes on [Darian].\"Norbury said that it wasn't until after 17:00 local time - three-and-a-half hours after the lockdown was first announced - that people started to be released from the school and he was able to find out that his wife was safe.Quist described the departure as \"organised chaos\". \"Professionalism definitely took hold,\" he said.But even then those involved did not know the full extent of what had happened until the casualty figures were revealed.\"A lot of people are shaken up right now, especially when we were told the true numbers,\" Darian Quist said.Though the names of the victims have not yet been released, it is clear the whole town has been deeply affected.Norbury said he believed he may have known some of the children involved.\"I was a children's librarian for 10 years, and knowing that these children that I likely knew, that I likely read to... these are our friends, our friends' children have been injured, lost their life, and we just have to think how to come together as a community and rely upon each other for support,\" he said.He added: \"Crime is incredibly low here, we've never had anything like this before. It's an incredible shock that anything like this could happen. We're such a tight-knit community, we're really like a family here.\"Norbury also reflected on the effect the shooting would have on the community in the future.\"How many people will be afraid to go to school? How many will this affect for the rest of their lives? And it absolutely will, that's my fear,\" he said. \"If I could talk to those people, I'd say, don't let this define you. Please get help when you need help. We are strong and we are resilient and we will get through this\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoAna FaguyGetty ImagesAn 18-year-old has been named as the suspect in a shooting that killed eight people and injured dozens more in British Columbia, Canada.Police said Jesse Van Rootselaar was found dead at the scene from a self-inflicted gunshot injury. The motive for the attack is not yet known.Six people were killed and at least 25 others were injured at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School. Two others - the suspect's mother, 39, and step-brother, 11 - were found dead at a nearby home. Authorities said Van Rootselaar was born a biological male but identified as a woman. \"I can say that Jesse was born as a biological male who approximately six years ago began to transition to female,\" Dwayne McDonald, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) deputy commissioner, said. The shooting at the nearby home occurred first, then the suspect went to the school, McDonald said.The victims at the school were a 39-year-old female educator, three female students, all aged 12, and two male students, one aged 12 and the other 13. Authorities do not believe there are other suspects involved in the shootings.Police said they had attended the suspect's family home on multiple occasions over the past several years, with some calls related to mental health concerns.Van Rootselaar previously had a valid gun licence that had since lapsed, McDonald said.Police said Van Rootselaar had dropped out of Tumbler Ridge Secondary School four years ago. Around 13:30 local time (20:30 GMT) on Tuesday, police received a report of an active shooter at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School. Officers arrived on the scene within two minutes of the call, heard active gunfire and entered the school, McDonald said. Within minutes they located the shooter, who was deceased from what police say was a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities found two firearms - a long gun and a modified handgun - on the scene. But McDonald said it remains unclear the exact roles the firearms played in the shooting. Police then began searching for victims throughout the school. Two victims were taken to hospital by air ambulance and remain in hospital. Tumbler Ridge has about 2,400 residents, and its secondary school has 160 students in Grades 7-12.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the students and teachers \"bore witness to unheard of cruelty\" during the shooting, noting that some victims remain in hospital \"fighting for their lives\".Tumbler Ridge Mayor Darryl Krakowka told CBC that the community is small and tight-knit, and that he expected the victims to all be people he knows.\"I will know every victim. I've been here 19 years, and we're a small community,\" he said, after emerging from the town hall when the shelter-in-place order was lifted.\"I don't call them residents. I call them family.\"",

    "body": "22 hours agoNardine Saad,Los AngelesandClaire KeenanReutersBritney Spears has sold the rights to her music catalogue.Pop superstar Britney Spears has sold the rights to her entire music catalogue, the BBC has learned. Spears, 44, is said to have sold to independent music publisher Primary Wave on 30 December for around $200m (£146m).The singer - whose protracted conservatorship long dictated her personal and professional life - is known for the hits ...Baby One More Time, Oops!... I Did It Again, Toxic and Gimme More.Primary Wave did not immediately respond to the BBC's requests for comment. Representatives for Spears declined to comment.In January 2024, the singer said she would \"never return to the music industry\". Her last song was a duet released with Elton John in 2022. Primary Wave has also acquired rights to the estates of Notorious BIG, Prince and Whitney Houston. Details of the sale and the exact price of Spears' catalogue have not been made public. High-profile artists such as Bruce Springsteen, Justin Bieber, Justin Timberlake, and Shakira recently sold their catalogues too. Springsteen sold his back catalogue to Sony in 2021 for $500m, and Bieber reportedly signed a $200m deal with Hipgnosis Songs Capital in 2023.The publisher was founded 20 years ago by music executive Lawrence Mestel after purchasing 50% of Kurt Cobain's portion of the Nirvana catalogue. Spears is one of the best-selling female artists, with more than 150 million records sold worldwide. Her catalogue includes nine studio albums since her debut in 1999. The sale comes after a tumultuous few years for the singer, who in 2021 ended a 13-year-long conservatorship – a legal guardianship that saw her finances and personal life controlled by her father. The singer published her memoir in 2023 titled The Woman in Me, which detailed her struggles living under the conservatorship. Her ex-husband Kevin Federline released his own memoir, You Thought You Knew, at the end of 2025. ",

    "body": "9 hours agoClaire KeenanandJaroslav LukivKharkiv regional military administrationA soft toy is seen among the wreckage of a house in the north-eastern Ukrainian town of Bohodukhiv after a Russian drone strikeAn overnight Russian drone strike has killed three toddlers and their father and also injured their pregnant mother in Ukraine's north-eastern Kharkiv region, local officials say.Regional head Oleh Synegubov said Ivan and Vladyslav, two-year-old twin boys, and their one-year-old sister Myroslava died when their house was hit in the town of Bohodukhiv. Their father was named as Hryhoriy, aged 34.The toddlers' mother Olha, 35, had minor burns - but survived. Russia has renewed its almost daily drone and missile strikes after a week-long pause earlier this month that Donald Trump had asked Vladimir Putin to observe as a fierce cold swept Ukraine.Ukraine's DSNS emergencies service/Kharkiv regionThe family's house was completely destroyed in the Russian attackIn a statement on social media, Synegubov described the Russian attack on Bohodukhiv as \"brutal\".He said that the family that was in the hit house had recently evacuated from a town near the Russian border, trying to escape constant shelling.\"It was their first night in the new place,\" the regional head added.Bohodukhiv, north-west of Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv, has been under almost daily Russian attack in recent days.On Monday,  a 41-year-old woman and a 10-year-old boy were killed in the town, local officials said.Russian forces also dropped seven bombs on the city of Slovyansk on Tuesday, Donetsk regional head Vadym Filashkin said on Telegram. Three people, including an 11-year-old girl, were killed.Moscow has increased pressure on the area by targeting transport and energy infrastructure with a record number of ballistic missiles, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.A state of emergency has been declared over the energy situation in the Kharkiv region by local authorities.It comes after a so-called \"energy truce\", which was meant to allow Ukraine's energy sector a reprieve during -20C (-4F) temperatures, expired last week.Tens of thousands of people across Ukraine are experiencing severe power cuts, and many households have no running water or heating.Zelensky has said the US wants the war with Russia to end by June, and that both sides had been invited to the US for talks next week. Meanwhile, a massive attack by Ukrainian drones on Volzhsky, in the Volgograd region in Russia, was reported on Wednesday night.Regional Governor Andrei Bocharov said an apartment was damaged in the strike and a fire broke out at a factory. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",

Watch: New video shows masked person outside Nancy Guthrie's home\"I hope they get the suspect, because I'm not it,\" Carlos said, according to a video posted on X by CBS reporter Andres Gutierrez.Carlos, reportedly a deliveryman, said he had been driving around and noticed authorities were following him.He added that the officers did not ask him any questions and made him wait for hours in a car park.A woman who identified herself as his mother-in-law earlier said that he had nothing to do with the case.\"They're just invading my property,\" she was quoted as saying by CBS.The Pima County Sherrif's Department had confirmed police were conducting a court-authorised search at a location in Rio Rico, south of Tucson, Arizona.The news of the detention came hours after the FBI released images and videos of a masked person at Nancy Guthrie's doorstep on the night of her disappearance. Authorities said the individual was armed.\"As of this morning, law enforcement has uncovered these previously inaccessible new images showing an armed individual appearing to have tampered with the camera at Nancy Guthrie's front door the morning of her disappearance,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said in a statement on X.He said authorities had been working to recover images from the home surveillance system that \"may have been lost, corrupted, or inaccessible due to a variety of factors - including the removal of recording devices\".The two short videos show the person approach the front door of Nancy Guthrie's home, then check the camera before moving away, picking up some vegetation from the ground and using it to cover the camera lens.Savannah Guthrie shared the new video on Instagram. \"Someone out there recognises this person,\" she said on Tuesday. \"We believe she is still out there. Bring her home.\"On Wednesday, the FBI said it was conducting an \"extensive search\" in the Catalina Foothills are related to the investigation.A senior official told CBS that the White House was monitoring the situation in Tucson closely. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that US President Donald Trump had reviewed the surveillance footage. Trump's initial reaction to the footage was \"pure disgust\", Leavitt said in response to a question at the press briefing.\"The President directed me to please encourage all Americans with any information to call the FBI,\" she added.US President Donald Trump, who ordered federal authorities to help in the investigation, previously called the case \"very unusual\".Guthrie was last seen at her home in Catalina Foothills, an affluent neighbourhood roughly 6 miles (10km) north-east of Tucson, on the evening of 31 January, when family members dropped her off after dinner.Getty ImagesSavannah Guthrie and her siblings have released videos on social media pleading for their mother's releaseAuthorities are investigating a series of ransom notes that could have been from her abductors, including one that contained two deadlines: 5 February and 9 February.Savannah Guthrie and her siblings have released several videos on social media pleading for their mother's release.The latest video was posted on Monday - the reported ransom deadline. In it, Savannah Guthrie pleads for the public to help locate her missing mother. \"I just want to share a few thoughts as we enter another week of this nightmare,\" she said in a the video posted on Instagram. \"She was taken, and we don't know where. And we need your help.\"The family has warned about their mother's ill health, saying that her health and heart were \"fragile\" and she \"lives in constant pain\".\"She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive. She needs it not to suffer,\" the news anchor said in a video posted on Instagram.Officials have also warned that Nancy Guthrie may be in dire health without her medication.Authorities said on the night of her disappearance, the app on her pacemaker - an implanted cardiac device - disconnected from her phone.Police also said they found blood on Guthrie's porch and analysis confirmed it was hers.The FBI is offering a $50,000 (£36,000) reward for information on the case.",

    "body": "11 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorAFP via Getty ImagesJacques and Jessica Moretti said nothing as they arrived for the hearing in Sion on WednesdayThe mother of two young women who were badly injured in the New Year's Day fire in the Swiss resort of Crans-Montana has had a private encounter with the couple who own the bar.Leila Micheloud had said earlier she wanted to \"speak privately\" to Jacques and Jessica Moretti, who were attending a hearing on the fire that left 41 people dead and 115 injured.A lawyer for the victims' families, Sébastien Fanti, said it was \"an extremely intense moment and rare in its humanity\", without going into what was said.During the hearing Jacques Moretti was questioned by lawyers for the families, and his wife was due to face further questions on Thursday.Micheloud told reporters outside the hearing in the Swiss town of Sion that her presence showed that the victims were \"not just names on a list but they too had faces\". Getty ImagesLeila Micheloud spoke to reporters outside the hearing before she met the MorettisShe told Swiss TV earlier of the injuries her daughters had suffered, and that \"we must fight, keep on fighting every day\". Farah, 20, is still in hospital with burns on over 35% of her body.Another mother,  Laetitia Brodard-Sitre, lost her 16-year-on son Arthur in the disaster and said what was important was for the truth to come out.\"There must be no more lies,\" she told public broadcaster SRF. \"I want everyone to take responsibility; politics and parties don't matter to me.\"AFP via Getty ImagesLaetitia Brodard-Sitre's 16-year-old son Arthur died in the fire at Crans-MontanaJacques and Jessica Moretti are under criminal investigation for involuntary manslaughter, as well as bodily harm and arson through negligence. Neither is being held in custody; Mr Moretti was released on bail last month.Micheloud's lawyer would not say what she had discussed with the Morettis, but described the encounter as an important moment in the process.\"There will be a time to say who is responsible for what. But there is also a time for humanity, to think of all the victims, of all the wounded,\" Fanti told reporters outside the hearing.The Morettis' lawyer, Yaël Hayat, had earlier described the hearings in Sion as \"moments of truth\", insisting that neither was trying to shirk justice for their part in the tragedy at Le Constellation bar.She told reporters that Micheloud had shown rare courage and humanity in approaching the couple: \"Maybe this moment will be, for both sides, a soothing moment in shared suffering.\"The Morettis have been criticised by several former employees for safety failings that have emerged since the fire. Sparkling candles in champagne bottles have been blamed for setting light to the ceiling, and footage has emerged showing an employee using snooker cues to push sound-proofing foam back into place on the ceiling weeks before the disaster.Many of the victims of the new year fire were teenagers - the ages of the dead ranging from 14 to 39. It has since emerged that a service door had been locked, preventing many of those inside the bar from getting out as the fire spread at about 01:30 on New Year's Day.A month after the disaster, the death toll rose to 41 when an 18-year-old Swiss man died of his injuries.No fire inspection had taken place there since 2019 and earlier this week, the former security officer at Crans-Montana's town hall told a hearing that local authorities had not closed any establishment there because of fire risks until last month. He said he had only checked La Constellation twice - in 2018 and 2019 - and the acoustic foam on the ceiling, blamed for the fast spread of the fire, was not considered part of his fire safety examination.Three days ago, one of the survivors of the fire, Mélanie Van de Velde, posted an open letter, describing the extent of her injuries and how her body had become \"a battlefield\", with 40% burns.\"Every time the dressings [on my wounds] are changed, every two days, is an ordeal. Every treatment revives the pain,\" she said on Facebook. \"My face will never be the same again... the one my daughter recognised is also gone.\"She also asked where justice was when responsibility had been left \"blurred, silent and diluted\".",

    "body": "7 hours agoJean OtalorWatch: An overturned truck lies on its side, as drone footage shows damage caused by deadly cycloneAt least 31 people have died after a powerful cyclone struck Madagascar, says the disaster authority in the Indian Ocean island.Cyclone Gezani made landfall on Tuesday, hitting the island's main port, Toamasina. Madagascar's disaster management office said there was \"total chaos\" - reporting that houses collapsed in the impact zone, where the bodies were found. Neighbourhoods were plunged into darkness as power lines snapped, while trees were uprooted and roofs ripped off.\"What happened is a disaster, nearly 75% of the city of Toamasina was destroyed,\" the country's military leader Colonel Michael Randrianirina, who seized power in October, told the AFP news agency.\"The current situation exceeds Madagascar's capabilities alone,\" he added.The cyclone's landfall is likely to have been one of the most intense recorded around the city in the satellite era, according to the CMRS cyclone forecaster on France's Reunion island, AFP reports.The National Office for Risk and Disaster Management said many were killed when houses collapsed. Cyclone Gezani hit Toamasina - the country's second-largest city - with winds reaching 250 km/hour (155 mph). \"It's total chaos, 90% of house roofs have been blown off, entirely or in part,\" the head of disaster management at the Action Against Hunger aid agency, Rija Randrianarisoa, told AFP.Madagascar's disaster management office has evacuated dozens of injured people and hundreds of residents from a district around Toamasina, home to 400,000 people.Residents in and around Toamasina described scenes of chaos as the cyclone made landfall. \"I have never experienced winds this violent... The doors and windows are made of metal, but they are being violently shaken,\" Harimanga Ranaivo told the Reuters news agency.AFP via Getty ImagesMany parts of Toamasina have been devastatedAFP via Getty ImagesSome boats were left grounded after the stormAFP via Getty ImagesTrees were uprooted and some districts left without powerGezani is the second cyclone to hit Madagascar this year. It comes 10 days after tropical cyclone Fytia killed 14 and displaced over 31,000 people, according to the UN's humanitarian office.Ahead of the cyclone's arrival, officials shuttered schools and rushed to prepare emergency shelters.Madagascar's meteorological service said on Wednesday morning that Gezani had weakened to a moderate tropical storm and had moved westward inland, about 100km (60 miles) north of the capital, Antananarivo.\"Gezani will cross the central highlands from east to west today, before moving out to sea into the Mozambique Channel this evening or tonight,\" the service said.Cyclone season in the Indian Ocean around Madagascar normally lasts from November to April and sees around a dozen storms each year, AFP reports.More about Madagascar from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "10 hours agoJaroslav LukivAFP via Getty ImagesStrict handgun laws are already in place across CanadaA deadly mass shooting at a school in British Columbia is likely to increase scrutiny of whether Canada's gun laws should be toughened to prevent further attacks. Nine people were killed and another 25 injured in the attack at Tumbler Ridge on Tuesday, in a remote part of the country that's about 415 miles (667km) north of Vancouver. The suspect was also found dead with a self-inflicted injury, authorities said.Currently, gun ownership in the Canadian provinces is largely federally regulated by the government in Ottawa, and there are stricter laws in place than in most US states.Mass shootings in Canada are rare, especially if compared with its southern neighbour.Still, gun-related killings as a percentage of all homicides are significantly higher in Canada than in England and Wales, or Australia.Tumbler Ridge mass shooting live updatesCurrent gun laws in CanadaUnder Canada's Firearms Act, guns must be kept locked and unloaded. Anyone wishing to buy a firearm is also subject to extensive background checks and needs to have a licence.Across the country, more than 2.2 million people - or 7.7% of Canada's adult population - had firearm licences, according to government statistics from 2021.An estimated 10 million firearms were in circulation in the country that year.According to a Canadian website on gun ownership, which obtained statistics from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, or RCMP, there were 355,678 gun licences in British Columbia as of 2023, or about 6,240 gun licenses per 100,000 people. But the website cautioned that many people own guns without a licence, which is illegal.A national freeze on the sale and transfer of handguns has also been in place since 2022. In January, the government began a national gun buy-back programme. A federal pilot programme in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, which aimed to collect 200 firearms, had only collected 26.Mass shootings in Canada over the yearsThe latest mass shooting follows a string of others over the past decade.In the wake of the attacks, most military-grade assault-style weapons were banned in the country.In 2014, a gunman shot dead eight people, including two children, in Edmonton,  Alberta, in western Canada.One of the deadliest shootings in the country took place decades earlier - in 1989. Fourteen women were killed by a gunman in an anti-feminist attack at l'École Polytechnique university in Montreal.",

    "body": "23 hours agoImogen JamesRoyal Family 'have not been transparent' over Epstein questions, US congressman saysAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor is facing growing pressure from US officials and the family of his prominent accuser Virginia Giuffre to testify in the US about his links to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Speaking to the BBC, Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna said the Royal Family had \"not been transparent\", while Democratic Congresswoman Teresa Leger Fernandez said King Charles III \"should direct his brother\" to go to the US to answer questions. On Monday, the King said the Royal Family were \"ready to support\" police in their inquiries. Andrew has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 containing no admission of liability.In the King's first intervention in the latest round of revelations in the Epstein scandal, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said if they were approached by the police, they stood \"ready to support them\" in their investigation. It added the King had \"made clear...his profound concern\" over allegations against his brother, and the King and Queen's \"thoughts and sympathies have been, and remain with, the victims of any and all forms of abuse\".Thames Valley Police announced on Monday it was assessing a complaint by anti-monarchy group Republic over the alleged sharing of confidential material by  Andrew with Epstein.The former prince appears to have knowingly shared confidential information with  Epstein from his official work as trade envoy in 2010 and 2011, according to material in the latest release of files seen by the BBC.Andrew has been contacted for comment but is yet to respond.Police assessing claims about Andrew sharing confidential trade detailsEpstein emails: So-called 'shady financier' was Andrew's 'trusted money man'ReutersThe King is now facing pressure to tell his brother to go to the US to testify to lawmakers When asked by the BBC if the former prince should go to the US, Khanna said that would be \"appropriate\". The Congressman, who co-sponsored the law that compelled the justice department to release the Epstein files last year, also said the Royal Family should \"come clean\" and lay out what they knew and what \"action they're going to take\". \"They have a large wealth, they should probably be compensating these survivors for the horrors that have taken place,\" he added. Khanna said the Royal Family were \"finally\" asking for an investigation, and that \"these women have been denied justice\". It comes a day after Khanna told journalists this was the \"most vulnerable\" the British monarchy had been, and said stripping Andrew of a title was not enough. \"The King has to answer what he knew,\" he said.The former prince has also moved out of his Windsor home and is currently living at Wood Farm on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk while his new permanent home undergoes renovations.Congresswoman Teresa Leger Fernandez, who is chair of the Democratic Women's Caucus, called for more transparency from Andrew. Speaking to the BBC's Newsnight, she urged the King to tell his brother to \"answer questions here at the Oversight Committee\". \"You cannot say 'I am protected because I'm no longer in the jurisdiction of the United States, so I cannot be held liable',\" Fernandez argued.She also called for an inquiry in England. She said Andrew \"was there, he knows who else was in the room with him. Who else was at those locations where these attacks took place?\"Sky Roberts, the brother of Virginia Giuffre, piled on the pressure earlier on Tuesday, telling journalists: \"I think he [Andrew] should show up in front of our Congress and answer questions.\"Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer agreed. The latest emails released by the US Department of Justice reveal there have been multiple unsuccessful approaches from US authorities for Andrew to help with Epstein inquiries.The former prince cannot be forced by a subpoena to go to the US, which has caused a lot of frustration. Last autumn, Democrats in Congress set a November deadline for the former prince to testify about what he knew about Epstein, but he gave no response.Since the release of three million more documents related to Epstein, there has been growing pressure on Andrew, with claims a second woman was sent to the UK by Jeffrey Epstein for a sexual encounter with him.Photographs appearing to show him kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground, both fully dressed, were also included in the latest batch of files.Andrew has consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing. Being named in the Epstein files is not an indication of misconduct.Correction 11 February 2026: An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to Teresa Leger Fernandez as a member of the House Oversight Committee. This has been amended.",

    "body": "3 hours agoMadeline HalpertWatch: Spats, theatrics and a walkout - How the Pam Bondi hearing unfoldedUS Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the justice department's handling of the Epstein files and faced a barrage of angry questions on other issues during a fiery congressional hearing on Wednesday.Her testimony before the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee descended at times into a shouting match, with Bondi at one point calling a Democrat a \"washed up loser\" and, after another heated exchange, one lawmaker even stormed out.Here are some of the key exchanges from the four-hour hearing. 1. Epstein victims watch as Bondi defends redactionsThe hearing followed the release by the justice department earlier this year of millions more files from its investigations into the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Several of Epstein's victims were seated behind Bondi at the hearing, and lawmakers frequently referenced them. In her opening statement, Bondi called Epstein a \"monster\" and told the victims she was sorry for the abuse they endured. But lawmakers then directed a host of complaints at Bondi about how the justice department has handled its release of the files. Several criticised what they said was a failure to redact the names of victims as was required by law. Democratic Representative Pramila Jayapal said that in some cases \"nude images\" - of survivors were released, some of whom have had their identities protected \"for decades\".Jayapal asked survivors in the room to stand and raise their hand if they had not been able to meet with the justice department, which led all of them to rise. Jayapal then asked Bondi to apologise to the victims for the justice department's handling of redactions.Bondi fired back, describing Jayapal's questioning as \"theatrics\" and adding: \"I'm not going to get in the gutter with this woman.\"The attorney general said at another point during the hearing that officials were doing their best to protect victims in the timeframe allotted by the legislation which required the files to be released. She said any names brought to them that have been released \"inadvertently\" have been \"immediately redacted\".2. Republicans join in over Epstein complaintsThe hearing turned tense over names in the Epstein files that had been redacted, too. A bipartisan group of US lawmakers has accused the justice department of improperly removing the names of people from the files who are not protected. They have been allowed to review unredacted versions of the files, which has since led the justice department to unredact names in at least one document.   Thomas Massie, a Republican who has been involved in these efforts, told Bondi he wanted to know who was responsible for the redactions and whether anybody will be held accountable for the \"failure\".Massie went on to say that this issue is \"bigger than Watergate\" and spanned numerous US administrations.\"This is a political joke,\" Bondi said as Massie continued to press her on why some people's names, including billionaire Les Wexner, had been blacked out from the files initially.FBI Director Kash Patel, who was also at the hearing, chimed in to say there was \"no evidence\" Epstein trafficked women to Wexner. Wexner has previously alleged that Epstein stole millions of dollars from him while working as his financial adviser.A legal representative for Wexner told the BBC: \"The Assistant US Attorney told Mr Wexner's legal counsel in 2019 that Mr Wexner was being viewed as source of information about Epstein and was not a target in any respect.\"\"Mr Wexner co-operated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again.\"3. Lawmaker asks about Andrew Mountbatten-WindsorDuring discussion of the Epstein files, California Democratic Representative Ted Lieu mentioned Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who is facing growing pressure from officials and the family of his prominent accuser Virginia Giuffre to testify in the US.Andrew has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 containing no admission of liability.Lieu had the hearing display a picture of the former prince from the Epstein files, which shows Mountbatten-Windsor on all fours hovering over a female. No context has been supplied for the photos.Getty ImagesIt is unclear when and where they were taken and the picture itself does not indicate criminality.Lieu asked why the photos had not been used to prosecute Mountbatten-Windsor. Bondi responded by asking why Lieu did not bring those questions to former Attorney General Merrick Garland.\"I agree with you,\" said Lieu, adding Garland \"dropped the ball\".4. Democrats push for Minneapolis investigationWhile the Epstein files took centre stage during the hearing, Bondi was also pressed by lawmakers on federal immigration agents fatally shooting two people in Minneapolis which sparked nationwide demonstrations. Tennessee Democratic Representative Steve Cohen told Bondi the shootings were \"executions\" that the justice department did not investigate. \"That was wrong, and you should investigate,\" he said. Bondi defended the federal government's actions in Minnesota, saying protesters and federal agents had been fuelled by elected officials who she claimed have obstructed law enforcement and declared themselves \"at war\" with the federal government.Other Republicans joined in to defend her, including the committee chair, Representative Jim Jordan, who praised how Bondi had implemented President Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration.",

    "body": "'We are treated as outcasts': Acid attack survivor fights for justice and dignity1 day agoCherylann MollanMumbaiShaheen MalikShaheen Malik has undergone 25 surgeries after she was attacked with acid in 2009Warning: This story contains distressing detailsShaheen Malik, an acid-attack survivor and disability rights activist in India, is fighting an uphill legal and social battle to secure justice and rehabilitation for others like her - and says she will not give up despite the odds.One survivor she's been helping is Ruman* who alleges that her husband beat her and forced her to drink acid during an episode of domestic violence in 2019. The alleged incident left her with severe internal injuries and a damaged oesophagus that had to be artificially reconstructed so that she could eat.Despite years of treatment, Ruman struggles to swallow food and eats little. At 28, she weighs just 21kg, less than the average weight of an eight-year-old girl. Basic tasks like going to the bathroom exhaust her and she needs constant medical supervision.But despite her grave situation, Ruman is unable to seek compensation and rehabilitative benefits that acid attack survivors are allowed under India's disability law. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 only recognises those as victims who have suffered visible disfiguration due to the \"throwing of acid or similar substances\", excluding those who have been forced to ingest acid.In December, Shaheen petitioned the Supreme Court saying the disability law must also include survivors like Ruman.\"For survivors of forced acid ingestion, the disfigurement is internal and hence not as obvious. But their lives are extremely challenging as they find it difficult to breathe, speak and swallow food despite numerous surgeries,\" she says.Malik, 42, has been campaigning for the rights of acid attack survivors for over a decade. Her determination to help others seems to come from the challenges she has had to battle as a survivor.She has undergone 25 surgeries and lost vision in her left eye after she was attacked with acid outside her workplace in northern Haryana state in 2009. Malik was in her 20s  at the time and was working as a student counsellor.For 16 years, she fought a legal battle to bring her perpetrators to justice before a trial court acquitted them in December. Malik says she's devastated, but not defeated, and has challenged the verdict.\"I fought for justice for myself. But now, I'm fighting for the sake of other survivors and victims of abuse. I want my case to be an example of justice served, that perpetrators won't walk free and will be made to face the consequences of their actions,\" she says.Shaheen MalikPriyanka* who was forced to ingest acid weighs just 25kg and is a member of Malik's foundationIn 2021, Malik, along with Laxmi Agarwal, another acid attack survivor, set up the Brave Souls Foundation - a non-profit that offers legal and economic aid to acid attack survivors. The foundation acts as a lifeline for those who have been shunned by society and their families and have nowhere to go for help.Around 50 survivors live in the foundation's shelter home in Delhi's Jangpura neighbourhood, where they are offered care and assistance. Ruman is among them as she does not want to be a burden on her parents, who are old and struggling to make ends meet, Malik says.The foundation is also helping Ruman fight her case after her husband appealed against his conviction in a higher court and was released on bail last year.Malik says she and Ruman are among hundreds of survivors who are fighting an uphill battle for justice. The conviction rate in acid attack cases is abysmally low with cases languishing in courts for years.A 2024 report which analysed data from 2017-2021 found that from the 600 cases pending trial in 2021, only 15 were disposed off by courts.Meanwhile, the number of acid attack cases in the country have been rising - NCRB recorded 176 in 2021, 202 in 2022 and 207 in 2023.Last month, while hearing Malik's petition, the Supreme Court directed all states to furnish a yearly report of acid attacks, cases disposed off and those pending in courts, as well as rehabilitation schemes offered to victims. It also sought details of victims forcefully made to ingest acid.Strongly condemning acid attacks, the judges called for \"extraordinary punitive measures\", including auctioning the assets of attackers to compensate their victims.The court also asked the federal government to consider \"legislative interventions\", like shifting the burden of proof on to the accused from the victim.While Malik welcomes the top court's observations and directions, she says that along with sprucing up laws, there's an urgent need to ensure their proper implementation.Shaheen MalikMalik with members of the Brave Souls FoundationShe points out that acid attack survivors still struggle to get affordable medical care even though private and public hospitals are legally mandated to provide free treatment to them, including reconstructive surgeries.\"Many private hospitals refuse to admit acid attack survivors until they are furnished with a court order, delaying life-saving treatment to victims,\" she says. \"And even after they are admitted, hospitals make the patient wait for long hours to receive treatment and often, discontinue it mid-way by making excuses,\" she adds.She also questions why it remains so easy to buy acid despite the increase in cases and existing regulations around over-the-counter sale of the substance.\"A single incident alters our whole life. We are treated like outcasts by society and face so many difficulties.

    "body": "1 hour agoAnna HolliganBusiness reporter, AmsterdamBBCGavin Arm and Bert de Wit introduced four-day working weeks at their business in 2019The Dutch have quietly adopted working just a four-day week. But what has been its impact, and can it last?\"Your kids are only young once,\" says Gavin Arm, co-founder of Amsterdam-based small business Positivity Branding.\"Most people, if they're running a company, they throw themselves into it and work, work, work to try and make it. And they're probably doing it for their kids.\"But then they look back when they're older and go 'I missed that part of their lives', and that's awful. We don't want to be like that.\"Arm is speaking to me at the firm's cosy office in the Dutch capital's lively De Pijp neighbourhood. South of the city centre, it is known for its bustling markets, bohemian history and heavy gentrification.His business, which he co-founded with colleague Bert de Wit, advises companies on their brand identity and packaging.Arm and de Wit switched themselves and their staff to a four-day week seven years ago.Employees did not have to take a cut in salary, and nor did they have to work longer hours on the four days. Instead, their hours remain at 32-per-week, or eight-per-day.\"The work-life balance was at the heart of it,\" adds de Wit, who disagrees with the suggestion that their staff are now doing less work for the same amount of money. Instead he puts it down to \"working smarter not harder\".\"In other countries they might spend a lot of time at work, but that doesn't mean they work a lot. Changing the culture and the mindset is the biggest challenge.\"AFP via Getty ImagesThe Dutch work the fewest hours per week in EuropeWorking a four-day week has now been common across the Netherlands for a number of years, with even the largest companies getting on board.Meanwhile, the country's biggest union, FNV, is continuing to lobby the Dutch government to make it the official recommendation. And, anyway, Dutch employees already have a legal right to request reduced hours.\"We like time to free up our mind. I get the best ideas when I walk my dog,\" says Marieke Pepers, chief people officer at the Dutch software firm Nmbrs.She takes Friday off every week. \"No one is expecting me, I get my inspiration, I'm in a better place, and the company is too.\"Pepers adds that since the company switched to a four-day week \"staff sickness is down, and retention is up\". But she says that the idea was initially a hard sell.\"We had to convince investors. Our own people were sceptical at first, 'I'm already not capable of finishing my work in five days' [was one reaction].\"Some people were feeling pressure. But we just have to be super‑critical in how we prioritise our work, we cut back on meetings.\"Marieke PepersMarieke Pepers says she gets her best ideas while out walking her dogThe Netherlands' quiet embrace of the four‑day working week has captured international attention. Dutch employees work an average of 32.1 hours per week, the lowest in the EU, and well below the bloc's average of 36 hours.At the same time, Dutch economic output or GDP per capita – relative to each person – remains both among the highest in Europe, and close to top of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) member states of developed economies.It challenges the assumption that rich countries need long hours to stay competitive.But is the reality of the Netherlands' four-day week as successful for the Dutch economy as the headlines suggest?\"It's true the Netherlands has high productivity and works fewer hours,\" says Daniela Glocker, an economist on the Netherlands desk at the OECD, \"but what we've seen over the past 15 years is that it [productivity] hasn't grown.\"So if the Dutch want to maintain their quality of life, they have to increase productivity or increase their labour supply.\"By this, she means that existing workers will have to start to produce more goods and services per day of work, or else the country will need additional people entering the jobs market, such as potentially through increased immigration.The Netherlands has the highest share of part‑time workers in the OECD, with almost half of employees working less than full time.Higher wages and the way Dutch taxes bite in the middle of the income distribution make extra hours less attractive, encouraging families to trade income for time.The government's own analysis notes that three out of four women and one out of four men work fewer than 35 hours.Unions argue that \"one day less\" can be good for energy, productivity and society, and that normalising four‑day patterns can keep people in work who might otherwise drop out altogether.But the OECD warns this strength comes with growing strains. Like most countries, the Netherlands faces an ageing population, so as more people retire fewer are in the workforce.\"The Dutch are rich and they work less – but the question is, how sustainable is this?\" says Nicolas Gonne, economist at the OECD. \"There's only so much you can do with few workers.\"What we see is the Netherlands is hitting constraints on all sides; the way to alleviate this is to expand [labour] supply.\"AFP via Getty ImagesSome economists say that more Dutch women need to work full timeOne way of increasing this supply could be getting more Dutch women working full-time. While female employment is high, more than half of Dutch women work part time – around three times the OECD average.Access to affordable childcare remains a major constraint, and high income taxes and complex benefits can discourage people, especially second earners, from working more hours.Peter Hein van Mulligen, from the Dutch Statistics Office (CBS), points to an \"institutionalised conservatism\" deep rooted in Dutch society, which acts as a barrier to women's participation.A 2024 study found one in three people in the Netherlands think that mothers with very young children (aged three or younger) should work not more than one day a week, and nearly 80% think that three days a week is the maximum.For fathers these shares are respectively 5% and 29%.\"Quite a difference,\" notes van Mulligen.Yvette Becker from FNV union says a four‑day working week can help close the gender gap. \"You gain productivity with less absenteeism.\"Back at Positivity Branding, de Wit says four-day working weeks make employment \"more attractive\", especially for sectors of the economy with shortages, such as education and health.\"It could be a way to make those professions way more attractive and get the productivity back up.\"His co-founder Arm adds his thoughts on the four-day week: \"Are you happier? Are you enjoying your life more? That's really what it's all about.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoDaniel BushWashington correspondentGetty ImagesBenjamin Netanyahu's visit on Wednesday marks his sixth trip to the US since Donald Trump's return to officeUS President Donald Trump said he insisted talks with Iran continue during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but warned he may take action against Tehran if a nuclear deal is not reached.The leaders met at the White House as tensions continue to rise across the Middle East and negotiations intensify over curbing Iran's nuclear weapons programme.Netanyahu was expected to press Trump to pursue a deal that would not only halt Iran's uranium enrichment, but cut its ballistic missile programme and support for proxy groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.Iran has suggested it is ready to limit its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief, but has rejected other demands.Ahead of the White House meeting, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian warned his country would \"not yield to their excessive demands\".Netanyahu's visit marks his sixth trip to the US since Trump's return to office - more than any other world leader. The leaders spoke for nearly three hours in an unusually low-key meeting in which Netanyahu was brought in through a side entrance, out of view of the cameras. Trump did not hold a press conference with him afterwards.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the meeting between the leaders had been \"very good\".\"There was nothing definitive reached other than I insisted that negotiations with Iran continue to see whether or not a deal can be consummated,\" he said.He added a deal was his \"preference\" but if one could not be reached \"we will just have to see what the outcome will be\".Netanyahu's office said the leaders had discussed \"the security needs of the State of Israel in the context of the negotiations\" and agreed to continue their \"close coordination and relationship\".A close Trump ally, Netanyahu has long argued that Iran represents an existential security threat to Israel and has pushed the US to curb Tehran's influence in the region.\"The prime minister believes that any negotiations must include limiting ballistic missiles and ending support for the Iranian axis,\" Netanyahu's office said in a statement ahead of his trip.After arriving in Washington on Tuesday, Netanyahu met Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner. The pair \"provided an update on the first round of negotiations they held with Iran last Friday\", according to the prime minister's office.Netanyahu's visit comes as the US increases its military presence in the Middle East, with Trump warning Tehran of strikes if it fails to reach a deal on its nuclear programme and to stop killing protesters. On Tuesday, the president said that he was \"thinking\" about sending a second aircraft carrier strike group to the Middle East. The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group was sent to the region last month after Trump threatened to strike Iran to stop a government crackdown on mass protests in which thousands of people were killed.\"We have an armada that is heading there and another one might be going,\" Trump said in an interview with Axios. He said Iran \"wants to make a deal very badly\", adding that a diplomatic solution remained possible.Trump told Fox Business that a good deal would mean \"no nuclear weapons, no missiles\".Iranian Presidency/WANA/Handout via REUTERSIran's President Masoud Pezeshkian warned it would \"not yield to excessive demands\"In a speech at a rally in Tehran on Wednesday marking the 47th anniversary of Iran's Islamic revolution, Pezeshkian said: \"Our Iran will not yield in the face of aggression, but we are continuing dialogue with all our strength with neighbouring countries in order to establish peace and tranquillity in the region.\"The Iranian president also reiterated that his country was \"not seeking to acquire nuclear weapons\". \"We have stated this repeatedly and are ready for any verification,\" he added.Israeli officials have also said their country reserves the right to take military action against Iran if it does not reach a nuclear agreement with the US. Netanyahu is under pressure from far-right allies in his government to use his ties to Trump to push for a wide-ranging US-Iran deal that meets the Israeli government's security concerns, experts say.\"Israel is concerned that in the haste to get a deal with Iran, the president might embrace a deal that doesn't address Iran's missile programme or support for proxy groups, or that allows it to have some remnant of its nuclear programme,\" said Daniel Byman, a professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service.\"One worry Israel and other allies have about the US under Trump is that he wants a deal more than he wants a particular outcome,\" added Byman.\"The Iranian regime today is really vulnerable,\" said Mohammed Hafez, a professor at the Naval Postgraduate School and expert on Middle Eastern politics. \"The US and Israel feel they hold all the cards, Iran is on its back foot, and they can make these maximalist demands.\"Trump withdrew the US from an Obama-era nuclear deal with Iran in his first term in office and reinstated sanctions that have severely strained its economy. The administration restarted talks last year to reach a new deal before the war between Israel and Iran.Despite this heightened rhetoric in recent weeks, Trump might still wish to avoid a direct military conflict with Iran if the nations cannot strike a nuclear deal, former US officials said.\"I don't think Trump wants a major military confrontation with Iran going into an election year,\" said James Jeffrey, a former US ambassador to Iraq and Turkey. \"And I think the Iranians know that.\"The visit also comes as the Trump administration presses Israel and Hamas to implement the next phase of their ceasefire agreement in Gaza.On Wednesday, Netanyahu met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to sign up as a member of Trump's Board of Peace.A White House spokesperson said Israel \"has had no better friend in its history than President Trump\".\"We continue to work closely with our ally Israel to implement President Trump's historic Gaza peace agreement and to strengthen regional security in the Middle East,\" said Anna Kelly, the spokesperson.Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire last October, ending a two-year war started by the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack inside Israel. Approximately 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage in the attack. Israel's military campaign in response has killed more than 71,000 people, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.Israel and Hamas have accused each other of frequent violations of the ceasefire since the first phase of the deal went into effect.The sides have not made much progress in moving to the second phase in the ceasefire deal, which calls for the disarmament of Hamas, a full withdrawal of Israeli military forces from Gaza, and reconstruction of the coastal territory.",

    "body": "2 days agoJonathan HeadSouth East Asia correspondentAFP via Getty ImagesThai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul's Bhumjaithai party achieved a stunning victory in the February electionAs the dust from what has been a hard-fought election campaign in Thailand settles, many Thais may be rubbing their eyes and asking, \"what just happened?\".Most of the opinion polls published before the election predicted a win for the progressive People's Party. Some suggested it would get more than 200 seats in parliament, a significant improvement on its already impressive 2023 result when it won 151. Few polls put the party of Prime Minister Anutin Chanrvirakul ahead.Yet once most of the votes had been counted, it was clear Anutin had achieved a stunning victory, and the young reformists had suffered a big setback. With a projected share of more than 190 seats, the path of Anutin's Bhumjaithai party is clear to form the next government, albeit with coalition partners.So why did a youthful, progressive party with an imaginative and tech-savvy campaign do so poorly compared to a transactional, old-style party with little ideological identity aside from strong loyalty to the monarchy?A harder race for the reformistsThe mixed voting system played a part. People in Thailand cast two ballots, one for a candidate in their constituency, and one for the party they prefer.At the national level the People's Party, with nearly 10 million votes, did much better in the party list than Bhumjaithai, with just under six million votes, although this was still a big drop compared to the more than 14 million Move Forward, the previous incarnation of the People's Party, won in 2023. But the party list accounts for only 20% of the 500 seats in parliament.As many as 80% of the seats are allocated by local contests, where whichever candidate get the most votes in each constituency wins the seat on a first-past-the-post basis. This is where the People's Party, which is relatively new and urban-based, is weaker because it lacks rural networks. Bhumjaithai, by comparison, is a past master at using its substantial resources to win local power-brokers to its side, and they exercise a lot of influence over voters in their areas. Anutin has used the defections of political veterans from other parties to grow Bhumjaithai from a medium-sized provincial movement which won only 51 seats in 2019, to a national-level election-winning powerhouse today.It was also harder for the reformists to distinguish themselves on a single issue this time. In 2023, after nine years being ruled by the stern, avuncular Prayuth Chan-ocha, the general who led the 2014 coup, there was a broad yearning for change, and the Move Forward party, under its suave, telegenic leader Pita Limjaroenrat, promised no deals with \"the uncles\" – those involved in the coup. This captured the imagination of the public, and there was a last-minute wave of support for them. In this election, there was no such defining issue, and the party had been forced to drop its campaign to amend the harsh lese majeste law after this was used by the courts to justify dissolving Move Forward and banning its leaders from politics.Anutin was also able to coalesce conservative support around his party, as opposed to having their voters split among several parties in 2023. His strident nationalism over the border conflict with Cambodia, his staunch support for the army and his intense loyalty to King Vajiralongkorn all defined him clearly as the standard-bearer for Thai conservatism.AFP via Getty ImagesPolls had projected a win for the progressive People's PartyAnother big factor was the steep decline in the fortunes of Pheu Thai, the once unbeatable election machine backed by former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra. It came second in 2023, with 141 seats, but is likely to see that total halved this time round after the past three years of political turmoil in which two of its prime ministers were dismissed by the constitutional court, and it was accused of mishandling relations with Cambodia. Thaksin has been jailed on old corruption charges, and could face further criminal complaints. Back in 2023, Pheu Thai lost support to Move Forward. This time, Bhumjaithai and other conservative parties were the beneficiaries of Pheu Thai's falling popularity in its old strongholds of the north and north-east.Some in the reformist camp will look back on their party's controversial decision to back Anutin to become prime minister last September, after the fall of the second Pheu Thai administration. At the time, the People's Party justified this strange alliance with its ideological opposite by promising not to join his government, and by extracting from him a pledge to hold a referendum on changing the military-drafted constitution, a priority for the reformists.But by not insisting on cabinet positions in return for their votes in parliament, the People's Party allowed Anutin to fill his cabinet with capable technocrats, burnishing his credentials as a can-do leader. And while the constitutional referendum was indeed held at the same time as the election on Sunday, and produced a clear vote in favour of changing it, the process of drafting and approving a new charter is so protracted it might be indefinitely delayed. Some now see this as a poor decision, which tarnished their reputation among more idealistic followers.In the end, though, the reformists always had a mountain to climb to get into government. Many of their leaders have already been banned from politics, their party has been dissolved twice, and one of their best members of parliament is likely to go to jail for six years on lese majeste charges. Even after their election loss, another 44 of their leading members now face bans from politics by the Supreme Court for supporting the proposal by Move Forward to soften the punishments under the lese majeste law.These impediments may well have disillusioned some of the voters who backed Move Forward three years ago. Turnout in this election at 65% was sharply down from the 75% seen in 2023.Anutin will face no such impediments. The many means by which elected governments, parties and politicians can be constrained by unelected bodies – the \"handcuffs\" on Thai democracy – have only ever been used on those challenging the status quo. Provided he can make terms with smaller coalition partners, the prime minister has a good chance of completing a full four-year term, something no civilian leader has managed to do in Thailand for 20 years.",

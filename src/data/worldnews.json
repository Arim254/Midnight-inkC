    "body": "6 hours agoHarry SekulichWatch: Stranded passengers walk past derailed train as wounded are carried from carriagesAt least 13 people died and almost 100 were injured after a train derailed in Mexico's south-eastern Oaxaca region, the Mexican navy said.The train, which was travelling between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean, was carrying 241 passengers and nine crew members.A total of 98 were injured, of whom 36 were being treated in hospital, the navy said. The train derailed as it rounded a bend near the town of Nizanda, officials said. Mexico's Attorney General confirmed an investigation was under way.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said five of those injured were in a serious condition. She said top level officials, including the Secretary of the Navy, were travelling to the site of the crash.Photos from the site of the crash showed rescue workers helping passengers alight the train, which had fallen off the rail tracks and partly tilted over the side of a cliff.The Interoceanic train, which connects the Pacific port of Salina Cruz with Coatzacoalcos on the Gulf Coast, had two locomotives and four passenger cars, the navy said. Mexico's navy operates the country's railway network.The Governor of Oaxaca Salomón Jara Cruz expressed \"deep regret\" over the accident in a statement and said state authorities were coordinating with federal agencies to assist those affected.The Interoceanic rail link was inaugurated two years ago to boost the region's economy, an initiative spearheaded by former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador.Designed to modernise the rail link across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the Mexican government has sought to develop the area into a strategic trade corridor, expanding ports, railways and industrial infrastructure.The train service is also part of a broader push to expand passenger and freight rail in southern Mexico and stimulate economic development in the region.",

    "body": "The man who disarmed one of the gunmen who killed 15 people at a Jewish event at Bondi Beach has revealed his thoughts in the moments before his heroic actions.In verified footage, Ahmed al Ahmed - a Sydney shop owner born and raised in Syria - tackled one of the two shooters from behind, wrestling a long-arm gun from him.\"I hold him with my right hand and start saying a word, you know, like to warn him -  'drop your gun, stop doing what you're doing',\" the father-of-two told the BBC's US partner CBS News in an exclusive interview.Mr Ahmed, who was shot several times by the other alleged gunman, said his actions saved \"lots of people... but I feel sorry still for the lost.\"In the interview, Mr Ahmed recalled the moment he tackled Sajid Akram, 50, who was shooting attendees at a Hanukkah event at Bondi Beach on Sunday 14 December. \"My target was just to take the gun from him, and to stop him from killing a human being's life and not killing innocent people.\"Fifteen people died during the attack - Australia's deadliest mass shooting since 1996 - and 40 others were injured. Police have declared the attack a terrorist incident targeting the Jewish community.Sajid Akram was shot dead by police while his son Naveed, the other alleged gunman who was hospitalised after the attack, has since been charged with 59 offences including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist attack.Mr Ahmed described the inner thoughts running through his head in the lead-up to his actions, which authorities and politicians have said saved countless lives. \"Emotionally, I'm doing something, which is I feel something, a power in my body, my brain,\" Mr Ahmed said. \"I don't want to see people killed in front of me, I don't want to see blood, I don't want to hear his gun, I don't want to see people screaming and begging, asking for help.\"That's my soul asking me to do that.\"In the days after the shooting, Mr Ahmed was presented with a cheque at his hospital bedside for A$2.5m (£1.24m; $1.7m) which had been raised from tens of thousands of community members moved by his actions. He was shot several times in the shoulder after tackling Sajid Akram and required at least three operations.Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Mr Ahmed in hospital, describing him as \"the best of our country\" while New South Wales Premier Chris Minns called him a \"real-life hero\".Earlier, Mr Ahmed's parents told BBC Arabic that their son was \"driven by his sentiment, conscience and humanity\".",

He was also taken to hospital for treatment and is under police guard.Local media has suggested the man was suffering from mental health issues, citing officials and residents, while the South American nation's president said his family and neighbours were among the victims.\"At a time when family and friends should be holding on to and supporting each other, we are confronted with the harsh reality that there is another side to the world,\" Jennifer Geerlings-Simons said in a statement.\"I wish all the bereaved much strength, courage and comfort during this unimaginably difficult time.\"Police said further details about the circumstances of the incident would follow. Suriname is among nations with the lowest rates of stabbing deaths, making incidents such as this one relatively rare.However, it has endured several coups and a civil war since gaining its independence from the Netherlands in 1975.",

    "body": "The Albanian nationalist Vetevendosje party has won a landslide victory in Kosovo's parliamentary elections, according to preliminary results. With 90% of the votes counted, the party, whose name means \"self determination\", was on 50.8%, meaning a third term in power for its leader, Albin Kurti. The two main opposition parties, the centre-right Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) and the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), were on 20.98% and 13.89%, respectively.Vetevendosje won elections in February, but without a majority, and Kosovo has been without a functioning government since then. The impasse meant there was one big question hanging over this second parliamentary election of the year. Would voters punish Kurti for the long months of deadlock in the country's National Assembly – or the opposition parties who refused to countenance a coalition with Kurti's left-wing movement?The electorate has given a clear answer. This will not be quite enough to deliver enough seats for Kurti to govern without coalition partners. But he should not find it difficult to find support among the MPs from the ethnic minority parties who are guaranteed 20 of the 120 seats in the National Assembly.It is the fourth successive victory in parliamentary elections for Vetevendosje. The result is vindication after the opposition parties blocked his attempts to form a government following the previous polls on February 9.Kurti claimed it was \"the greatest victory in the history of the country\" – and said he expected opposition parties to cooperate, rather than frustrate, this time around.Arben Gashi, of the third-placed Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), indicated that could be possible. \"When voters speak, the result cannot be ignored,\" he posted on social media. \"Reflection and responsible action are required,\" he added.There is plenty at stake. Kosovo has missed out on hundreds of millions of euros' worth of European Union funds because of the lack of a functioning government. Kurti also cited potential agreements with the World Bank which would bring the total sum to more than €1bn.Repairing relations with Kosovo's strongest international supporters, the EU and the US, should also be on the agenda. Kurti angered Brussels and Washington by repeatedly targeting institutions serving Kosovo's Serb minority – from post offices to healthcare facilities. This increased tensions in majority-Serb north Kosovo.The EU has finally agreed to remove the punitive measures it imposed in 2023. But it will be looking for Kurti to take a pragmatic approach to the long-stalled normalisation dialogue with Serbia, rather than stick to his usual dogmatic line. Given his frosty relations with Serbia's president, Aleksandar Vucic, this may be a vain hope.The fact that Kosovo's voters have resoundingly endorsed such a polarising figure reflects their jaundiced view of the alternatives. Parties connected to the Kosovo Liberation Army dominated government in the decade following 2008's unilateral declaration of independence – but failed to deliver on their promises of prosperity.One analyst, Artan Muhaxhiri, noted Vetevendosje's \"countless violations of the constitution, the lack of economic development and the breakdown of relations with allies\" over its years in power. But he concluded that \"despite all the shortcomings, citizens have considered the opposition to be more harmful\".",

    "body": "Italian police have arrested nine people accused of raising around €7m (£6m) for Hamas over more than two years.The money was ostensibly collected as humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians, a police statement said, but was instead sent to the militant group via a \"complex fundraising system\".Alongside the arrests, police say they have seized more than €8m (£7m) in assets as part of the investigation. Police say the suspects are \"specifically accused of carrying out financing operations believed to have contributed to terrorist activities\".The arrests were made as part of a joint initiative between Italy's counter-terror police and financial police.The investigation began after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack in southern Israel. Police say they analysed \"a series of reports of suspicious financial transactions\" involving some of the suspects in the lead up to the attack.Investigators uncovered a \"complex\" system of fundraising, which was headquartered in Genoa with branches in Milan, the statement adds.\"The suspects collected donations intended for the civilian population of Gaza, however, it emerged that over 71% of these funds were diverted to Hamas's coffers to finance its military wing and support the families of suicide bombers or those detained for terrorism,\" the police statement says.Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said the most well-known of the arrested suspects was Mohammad Hannoun, the president of the Palestinian Association in Italy.Piantedosi thanked police for their work in a post on X, but also noted that \"the presumption of innocence... must always be recognised at this stage\".Mr Hannoun said that he is \"neither closely nor remotely\" related to Hamas but has always supported them. \"I have always declared with utmost transparency that I am a Palestinian citizen and publicly support the legitimate resistance of the Palestinian people,\" he told reporters.",

    "body": "20 hours agoSebastian UsherMiddle East analystThe number of executions in Iran in 2025 is estimated to have more than doubled compared to the number that took place across the country in 2024. Norwegian-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) group told the BBC it had verified at least 1,500 executions up until the start of December, adding that many more have taken place since.Last year, IHR was able to verify 975 executions - although the exact number is never completely clear as Iranian authorities do not give official figures.However, the analysis shows another significant annual rise, and the figures chime with those provided by other monitoring groups.Iran's government has previously defended its use of the death penalty, saying it is limited to only \"the most severe crimes\".Execution figures were already on the rise before mass demonstrations broke out across the country in 2022 following the death in custody of Mahsa Amini.The 22-year-old Kurdish woman was detained by morality police in Tehran for allegedly wearing her hijab \"improperly\".That protest movement represented the biggest challenge to the legitimacy of Iran's theocratic leadership for many years.In response, authorities intensified the rate of executions from around 520 in 2022 to 832 the following year - according to the figures verified by IHR.There have been some executions for protesters or alleged spies - but 99% of those executed have been for murder or drug offences - a ratio which has remained constant.Activists have said that the rate of executions in Iran increases when the regime feels under threat and that the aim is to forestall internal opposition by instilling fear in the population.It seems to be borne out by the fact that since the 12-day war with Israel in June, as well as major setbacks for Iran's proxy forces across the region, there's been another big surge.",

    "body": "Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro has received a medical procedure to treat his chronic hiccups, his medical team has said.Saturday's treatment \"went well\", according to one of his doctors. Another, Claudio Birolini, added that the procedure - which he stressed was not a surgery - lasted for \"about an hour\".The far-right former leader is currently serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup after he lost the Latin American nation's 2022 presidential election to left-wing opponent Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.This latest procedure comes after the 70-year-old successfully underwent surgery for a double hernia earlier this week, after being granted permission to be transferred to hospital.Ahead of the surgery, Bolsonaro also endorsed his son Flávio to run against Lula in Brazil's 2026 presidential election. His statement - a handwritten letter - was read out by the younger Bolsonaro outside the hospital.Following the successful surgery, his medical team deemed it necessary to treat his recurrent hiccups, which he had been suffering from for months.\"It's been nine months of struggle and anguish with daily hiccups,\" Bolsonaro's wife, Michelle, said on Saturday.She explained in a social media post that her husband's procedure had \"blocked\" one of his phrenic nerves.The phrenic nerves contract and expand the diaphragm, which allows the lungs to inhale and exhale. Hiccups are caused by the involuntary spasming of the diaphragm, typically as a result of an irritated phrenic nerve.His doctors later confirmed they had treated the right phrenic nerve and had scheduled to work on the left nerve on Monday.Once discharged from hospital, the former president will return to a cell in the federal police headquarters to continue serving his sentence. Bolsonaro was found guilty of the coup plot in September. He was placed under house arrest pending appeals, but was taken into police custody last month after being deemed a \"concrete flight risk\".Court officials said he had attempted to break his ankle monitor and planned to use a rally outside his house as cover for an escape attempt. Bolsonaro insisted he had no intention of fleeing.Also on Saturday, Brazil's Supreme Court ordered the house arrest of 10 officials for participating in his coup attempt. All of them had served in his government.",

Further north, regional utility company Hemab said one of its employees died in an accident while out working.Police also said a man in his 60s was taken to hospital after being hit by a tree while working in a forest in Hofors, east-central Sweden, and later died of his injuries.Tens of thousands of homes in Sweden, Norway and Finland have been left without power as a result of the storm.In Sweden, more than 40,000 homes were affected by power outages and numerous rail services were cancelled, Swedish news agency TT reported.Several flights, rail and ferry services across parts of the Nordic nations have been cancelled. Roads and rail services have also been disrupted due to the storm conditions.In Norway's Nordland region, one of the most northerly counties in the country, the fire department responded to more than 200 weather‑related incidents, broadcaster NRK reported.Storm Johannes cut power to around 23,000 homes in Nordland and a further 9,000 were without electricity in the Inland region, according to NRK.In Finland, the storm - known there as Hannes - subsided on Sunday morning but had left more than 60,000 homes without power, according to public broadcaster Yle.Flights at Kittila airport in northern Finland were grounded after heavy winds pushed a passenger jet and a smaller plane off the runway and into a bank of snow, the Helsinki Times reported.The Swiss Air jet, carrying about 150 passengers, had just landed from Geneva and was taxiing when it veered off, the paper said. The smaller jet, a 400XT model, was on the ground at the same time and was also pushed off course by the wind, it added.There have been no reported injuries.",

The five identical sisters, born in Ontario at the height of the Great Depression in 1934, were the first known quintuplets to survive past infancy. They quickly became a global sensation during their childhood - starring in feature films, appearing on the covers of magazines, and endorsing products from toothpaste to syrup. \"Much beloved, Annette had championed children's rights,\" the museum said in a statement announcing her death. Getty ImagesThe Dionne quintuplets on their fourth birthday in 1938The museum, which seeks to preserve their legacy and educate the public on the quintuplets' controversial upbringing, added: \"She believed it was important to maintain the Dionne Quints Museum and the history it provides for the future of all children.\"The quintuplets - Annette, Yvonne, Cécile, Émilie and Marie - were taken away from their parents by the Ontario government when they were infants.For several years, the authorities displayed the children in a compound dubbed \"Quintland\", which became a popular tourist attraction.The children were constantly examined and observed, and had limited contact with their parents and siblings.Their parents later regained custody of the quintuplets. Getty ImagesThe quintuplets on their second birthdayAs adults Annette, Cécile and Yvonne sued the Ontario government for compensation over the circumstances of their childhood, and they received a settlement totalling nearly C$3m (£1.6m; $2.2m) in 1998. Annette was the last surviving sibling out of the 14 Dionne children, the Dionne Quints Home Museum said.Prior to Annette and Cécile's deaths this year, Émilie died in 1954, Marie died in 1970 and Yvonne died in 2001.

    "body": "20 hours agoSebastian UsherMiddle East analystWidespread tributes have been shared for Bahram Beyzai, a giant of Iranian cinema and theatre, who has died aged 87 in the US.The front pages of Iranian newspapers mourn his loss, with opposition voices and those who look back fondly on the Shah era also paying homage to Beyzai.Prince Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the last Shah of Iran, described his passing as \"a great loss for the the art and culture of our country\".Although Beyzai's later films were banned in the 1980s by the Islamic regime that toppled the Shah, a number of senior figures in the current government have also paid tribute to his contribution to Iranian culture.Several of the current crop of Iranian filmmakers have acknowledged their debt to him, with Jaafar Panahi - whose latest film won the top prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival - saying that he taught them \"how to stand up to oblivion\".Beyzai avoided direct political references in his work, both as a playwright and a film director, and always said he tried not to trade in overt messages.But his work over many decades sets historical, even mythic figures in conflict with oppressive religious and political systems.From a family of celebrated poets, Beyzai was imbued in the deepest traditions of Persian culture from birth.He first found fame as a playwright, drawing on Persian legend and ritual.A lifelong fan of cinema, he moved into making films in the 1970s.He won renown as one of the key figures in the new wave of Iranian cinema.His most productive period straddled the era of the Shah and then the Islamic theocratic forces that deposed him - with both systems ever ready to sniff out hidden messages that could be interpreted as dissent.As Jaafar Panahi has put it in his tribute: \"Beyzai did not choose the easy way. He endured years of exclusion, imposed silence, and distance, but he did not give up his language and his beliefs.\"A few years after the Iranian Revolution, he produced what many regard as his masterpiece, Bashu, the Little Stranger, about a small boy who tries to take refuge from the Iran-Iraq war. It was banned in Iran - as were other films he made in that period - but later voted by film critics as the greatest Iranian film of all time.The film was shown in a restored version at this year's Venice Film Festival, winning an award for best film in the classics section.Beyzai finally left Iran in 2010, and spent his later years in the US where he taught Iranian culture.Although he left his homeland, his wife, the actress Mozhdeh Shamsai, said just hearing the word Iran would still bring tears to his eyes - and he remained ever hopeful of a new culture and future for his homeland.",

    "body": "A cruise ship has run aground in Papua New Guinea (PNG) on its first trip since the death of an elderly passenger in late October. The Coral Adventurer is currently under investigation over the death of Suzanne Rees, 80, who died on a remote Australian island after being left behind by the ship. On Saturday, the vessel suffered a \"grounding incident\" off the eastern coast of PNG, around 30km (18 miles) from the city of Lae, a spokesperson for the ship said. All passengers and crew aboard the cruise ship have been reported safe, and initial inspections have not revealed any damage to the hull. Further inspections will take place on Sunday. A spokesperson for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) told the BBC in a statement that it had not received a distress call from the Coral Adventurer.It added it was monitoring the situation and would support PNG authorities if necessary. No decisions have been made about the current 12-day voyage, which was due to finish on 30 December.There were 80 passengers and 43 crew members aboard the ship at the time of the incident.The Coral Adventurer is currently the subject of a joint investigation by Amsa and Queensland Police, Ms Rees was found dead on Lizard Island on 26 October.She had been hiking on the island with fellow passengers, but broke off from the group for a rest. The ship left without her and returned several hours later after the crew realised the woman was missing.A major search operation found her body the following day.The ship was just two days into a 60-day voyage at the time of Ms Rees's death. The remainder of the cruise was cancelled with full refunds offered to all passengers.  The CEO of Coral Expeditions, Mark Fifield, said that the company was \"deeply sorry that this has occurred\" and had offered its full support to the Rees family.Mr Fifield added that the cruise operator was \"working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation\".Amsa was not able to comment on the status of the investigation, and told the BBC that it was \"not in the practice of making the results of its investigations public\".

    "body": "6 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jr,Washington DCandHarry SekulichDonald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky said progress had been made to end the Ukraine war during Florida talks but the US leader added \"one or two very thorny issues\" remained.While both the US and Ukrainian presidents described the talks as \"great\", Trump reiterated that a key sticking point was the question of territory. Russia has previously demanded that Ukraine hand over more land.Addressing reporters at Mar-a-Lago, Zelensky said they had come to an agreement on \"90%\" of a 20-point peace plan, while Trump said a security guarantee for Ukraine was \"close to 95%\" done.Zelensky later said US and Ukrainian teams would meet next week for further talks on issues aimed at ending Russia's nearly four-year war in Ukraine.\"We had a substantive conversation on all issues and highly value the progress that the Ukrainian and American teams have made over the past weeks,\" Zelensky said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.A proposal to turn the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, which Russia largely controls, into a demilitarised zone remains \"unresolved\", Trump said.\"Some of that land has been taken,\" he told reporters after the meeting. \"Some of that land is maybe up for grabs, but it may be taken over the next period of a number of months.\"Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The regions are collectively known as Donbas.Russia wants Ukraine to pull back from the small part of the territory it still controls in Donbas, while Kyiv has insisted the area could become a free economic zone policed by Ukrainian forces.The US president has repeatedly changed his own position on Ukraine's lost territories, and in September stunned observers by suggesting that Ukraine might be able to take it back. He later reversed course.\"[That] is a very tough issue,\" he said. \"One that will get resolved.\"Security guarantees for Ukraine are \"95% done\", Trump said, without formally committing to logistical support or troop deployment to help protect Ukraine from future attacks.Trump floated the possibility of trilateral talks between the US, Russia, and Ukraine, saying it could happen \"at the right time\".While the US president is keen to add the Ukraine-Russia war to the list of conflicts he claims to have ended, he cautioned that stalled or scrapped talks that go \"really badly\" could mean that the war continues.Earlier Trump had a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. While the US president did not offer many details of the phone call, he said he believed the Russian leader \"wants Ukraine to succeed\".At the same time, Trump acknowledged that Moscow had little interest in a ceasefire that would allow Ukraine to hold a referendum.\"I understand that position,\" he added.Russian foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov said the call was initiated by Trump and that he and Putin discussed the latest EU and Ukraine proposals to end the war.Ushakov, Russia's former US ambassador, said Trump listened to the Kremlin's assessment of the proposals and the two presidents left the call united in their belief that a temporary ceasefire proposed by the EU and Ukraine would instead prolong the conflict.Zelensky suggested the Ukrainian officials could meet at the White House in January, potentially alongside European leaders, as the US and Ukrainian delegations finalise plans for further talks.In a post-meeting call with European allies, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hailed \"good progress\" in the Florida talks while reinforcing the need for Ukraine to receive \"ironclad security guarantees from day one\".French President Emmanuel Macron also said Kyiv's allies would meet in Paris next month to discuss security guarantees.\"We will bring together the countries of the Coalition of the Willing in Paris in early January to finalise each one's concrete contributions,\" Macron said on X after speaking with Zelensky and Trump.",

    "body": "Just nowKoh EweEastern Theater CommandThe Chinese military published a video on Monday showing warships being deployed as it announced drills in the Taiwan StraitChina is holding military drills around Taiwan simulating the seizure and blockade of the island's key areas, as a warning against \"separatist forces\".The army, navy, air force and rocket force have been dispatched for the drills which include live-fire exercises, the Chinese military said.Codenamed \"Justice Mission 2025\", the drills are taking place days after the US announced the sale of one of its largest weapons packages to Taiwan worth $11bn (£8.2bn). That move drew sharp protest from Beijing which in turn sanctioned US defence firms. Taiwan's push to ramp up its defence this year has also angered Beijing, which claims the self-ruled island as its territory.Taiwan's presidential office has criticised the upcoming Chinese drills, calling them a challenge to international norms.Taiwan's defence ministry said that they detected Chinese aircraft and ships around Taiwan on Monday morning, and have deployed their own forces and missile systems to monitor the situation. Its forces are on \"high alert\" to defend Taiwan and \"protect our people\", the ministry said.In a post on Weibo, the Chinese military's Eastern Theater Command - in charge of the Taiwan Strait - described the upcoming military exercise as a \"shield of justice\".\"All those plotting independence will be annihilated upon encountering the shield!\" the post read.While some initial drills have begun, the military said it would conduct a major exercise from 08:00 to 18:00 local time on Tuesday.Beijing's foreign ministry called the drills a \"severe punishment for separatist forces seeking independence through force\" and warned \"external forces\" against \"using Taiwan to contain China\".\"Any sinister schemes to obstruct China's reunification are doomed to fail,\" the ministry's spokesman Lin Jian said at a regular press briefing on Monday.While China has long called for the \"peaceful reunification\" with Taiwan, it also has a law stating it will resort to \"non-peaceful means\" to prevent the island's \"secession\".Beijing has accused Taiwan's president Lai Ching-te of pursuing \"Taiwan independence\". The president maintains Taiwan is already a sovereign nation and therefore has no need to formally declare independence.On Sunday, Lai said in a local television interview that Taiwan needed to \"keep raising the difficulty so [China] can never meet the standard\" for an invasion.He also said that his administration was committed to \"maintaining the status quo\" and would not provoke China - though he added that peace relies on \"real strength\".Polls consistently show that most Taiwanese people want the \"status quo\", meaning they neither want to unify with China, nor to formally declare independence.CCTVChinese state media published a map released by the military showing Tuesday's drill locations around TaiwanSince 2022 Beijing has ramped up military drills in the Taiwan Strait, usually in response to what it deems as threats such as former US Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in 2022 and Lai's inauguration in 2024.China's last live-fire exercise in the Taiwan Strait, held in April, simulated strikes on key ports and energy facilities, the People's Liberation Army said at the time. Along with the drills, the Chinese military released a series of cartoons depicting Lai as a \"parasite\".This week's military drills are the first to be held under Yang Zhibin, the new chief of the Eastern Theater Command who assumed his role in October.Taiwan holds military exercises of its own, both to prepare its population for an attack and showcase its defences to Beijing. This year's Han Kuang exercise, which took place over 10 days, was the largest and longest one yet.Since taking office, Lai has vowed to boost defence spending and enhance the island's defence capabilities in the face of increasing tensions with Beijing.In October, the Taiwanese president announced the building of a dome-like air defence system to guard against \"hostile threats\" - though he did not explicitly mention China.The drills this week in the Taiwan Strait would also aim at deterrence \"outside the island chain\", China's military said.China's ties with Japan have plunged to their iciest in years after Japanese leader Sanae Takaichi suggested last month -  in response to a question asked in parliament - that Japan's self-defence forces could step in if China attacked Taiwan.China has lodged heated protests and issued warnings to its citizens to avoid travel to Japan. Earlier this month, Japan protested after Chinese fighter jets locked radars on Japanese aircraft while Beijing accused Tokyo of \"harassing\" its forces during a training exercise.",

But in the 25 years Vladimir Putin has been in power, Russia's rich and powerful - known as oligarchs - have lost almost all their political influence.All this is good news for the Russian president. Western sanctions have failed to turn the uber-rich into his opponents, and his carrot-and-stick policies have turned them into silent backers.Former banking billionaire Oleg Tinkov knows exactly how the sticks work. The day after he criticised the war as \"crazy\" in an Instagram post, his executives were contacted by the Kremlin. They were told his Tinkoff Bank, Russia's second-largest at the time, would be nationalised unless all ties to its founder were cut.\"I couldn't discuss the price,\" Tinkov told the New York Times. \"It was like a hostage - you take what you are offered. I couldn't negotiate.\"Within a week, a company linked to Vladimir Potanin - currently Russia's fifth-richest businessman, who supplies nickel for fighter jet engines - announced that it was buying the bank. It was sold for only 3% of its true value, says Tinkov.In the end, Tinkov lost almost $9bn (£6.5bn) of the fortune he once had, and left Russia.Chris Graythen/Getty ImagesOleg Tinkov lost billions and left Russia after criticising the war against UkraineThis is a far cry from the way things were before Putin became president. In the years following the break-up of the Soviet Union, some Russians became fabulously rich by taking ownership of massive enterprises formerly owned by the state, and by exploiting the opportunities of their country's nascent capitalism. Their newly acquired wealth brought them influence and power during a period of political turmoil and they became known as oligarchs.Russia's most powerful oligarch, Boris Berezovsky, claimed to have orchestrated Putin's ascent to presidency in 2000, and years later he appealed for forgiveness for doing so: \"I didn't see the future greedy tyrant and usurper in him, the man who would trample freedom and stop Russia's development,\" he wrote in 2012.Berezovsky may have exaggerated his role, but Russia's oligarchs were certainly capable of pulling strings at the highest echelons of power.A little more than a year after his apology, Berezovsky was found dead in mysterious circumstances in exile in the UK. By that time, Russian oligarchy was well and truly dead, too.Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesBoris Berezovsky went into exile in the UK where he later died in mysterious circumstances in 2013So when Putin gathered Russia's richest in the Kremlin hours after ordering the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, there was little they could do to object, even though they knew their fortunes were about to take a massive hit.\"I hope that in these new conditions, we'll work together just as well and no less effectively,\" he told them.One reporter present at the meeting described the assembled billionaires as \"pale and sleep-deprived\". The run-up to the invasion was very bad for Russia's billionaires, and so was its immediate aftermath. According to Forbes magazine, in the year to April 2022, their number fell from 117 to 83 because of the war, sanctions and a weakened rouble. Collectively, they lost $263bn - or 27% of their wealth each on average.But the years that followed showed that immense benefits were to be reaped from being part of Putin's war economy.Lavish spending on the war spurred economic growth of more than 4% a year in Russia in 2023 and 2024. It was good for even those among Russia's ultra-rich who were not making billions directly out of defence contracts.In 2024, more than half of Russia's billionaires either played some role in supplying the military or benefited from the invasion, says Giacomo Tognini, from Forbes's Wealth team.\"That's not even counting those who aren't directly involved, but do need a relationship of sorts with the Kremlin. And I think it's fair to say that anyone running a business in Russia needs to have a relationship with the government,\" he told the BBC.This year saw the highest ever number of billionaires in Russia - 140 - on the Forbes list. Their collective worth ($580bn) was just $3bn shy of the all-time high registered in the year before the invasion.While allowing loyalists to profit, Putin has consistently punished those who have refused to toe the line.Russians remember all too well what happened to oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Once Russia's richest man, he spent 10 years in jail after launching a pro-democracy organisation in 2001.AFPMikhail Khodorkovsky was Russia's richest man but he was sent to jail and his oil company Yukos was nationalisedSince the invasion, almost all of Russia's mega-rich have stayed quiet, and those few who have publicly opposed it have had to abandon their country and much of their wealth.Russia's wealthiest are clearly key to Putin's war effort, and many of them, including the 37 business people summoned to the Kremlin on 24 February 2022, have been targeted by Western sanctions.But if the West wanted to make them poorer and turn against the Kremlin, it has failed, given the continuing wealth and absence of dissent among Russian billionaires.If any of them had considered defecting to the West with their billions, the sanctions made that impossible.\"The West did everything possible to ensure that Russian billionaires rallied around the flag,\" says Alexander Kolyandr of the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA). \"There was absolutely no plan, no idea, no clear path for any of them to jump ship. Assets were sanctioned, accounts frozen, property seized. All that effectively helped Putin to mobilise the billionaires, their assets and their money, and use it to support the Russian war economy,\" he tells the BBC.The exodus of foreign companies in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine created a vacuum quickly filled by Kremlin-friendly business people who were allowed to buy up highly lucrative assets on the cheap.This created a new \"army of influential and active loyalists\", argues Alexandra Prokopenko of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.\"Their future wellbeing depends on continued confrontation between Russia and the West,\" while their worst fear is the return of the previous owner, she says.In 2024 alone, 11 new billionaires emerged in Russia in this way, according to Giacomo Tognini.Russia's leader has maintained a firm grip on the country's key movers and shakers, despite the war and Western sanctions - and in some respects because of them.",

    "body": "Australian police have called off a search for a four-year-old boy who has been missing in the outback for almost three weeks, after fresh efforts failed to find any traces of the child.Gus Lamont was last seen playing outside his home on a remote sheep station near Yunta, about 300km (186 miles) from Adelaide, on 27 September.His grandmother left him alone for about half an hour before checking on him, only to find the boy missing, prompting one of the largest land and air searches in South Australian history.Police - who do not suspect foul play - say they will continue investigating, but that the case has become a \"recovery operation\".Last week, authorities briefly wound down the search, only to restart it on Tuesday alongside 80 Australian Defense Force personnel.Commissioner Grant Stevens said authorities were searching a wider area based on updated assessments from survivability, medical and search specialists, rather than any new information.On Friday, police confirmed that the new search had not uncovered any signs of Gus.\"The fact Gus is a small child, the terrain is extremely rugged, harsh and subject to changing weather conditions has made the searching difficult and more challenging for those involved,\" police said in a statement.About 470 sq km - an area roughly twice the size of Edinburgh - has now been covered, and a 12-person taskforce set up earlier this week is expected to continue investigating. Police have not ruled out more searches of the property in the future.Gus, who has been described as an adventurous but shy boy, was last seen wearing a grey hat, light grey long pants, boots and a blue long-sleeve T-shirt featuring a yellow Minion character. Police believe he wandered off. The case has sparked huge interest across Australia, with images of the blond, curly-haired boy featured across local media and speculation running rife online.It prompted police to ask that members of the public stop calling them with their \"opinions\", and appeal for them to source information from credible places.Their warning came after fake AI-generated images of the child spread on social media, which the BBC's Verify team investigated.Police earlier this week said the boy's family remain \"stoic\" despite the tragic circumstances.\"You can imagine just how they are feeling... without having answers as to exactly where Gus is and what's happened to him. This would be traumatic for any family,\" Commissioner Stevens said.Through a spokesperson, the Lamont family has previously said they are \"devastated\" by Gus's disappearance. \"This has come as a shock to our family and friends, and we are struggling to comprehend what has happened,\" Bill Harbison said, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\"Gus's absence is felt in all of us, and we miss him more than words can express.\"",

    "body": "Thousands of mourners have gathered at a national stadium in the Kenyan capital for the state funeral of former Prime Minister Raila Odinga. Many carried national flags, portraits of the late leader, and wore T-shirts printed with his image to pay their final respects. Security remains tight in and around the stadium, with police and military officers deployed to prevent a recurrence of the unrest witnessed on Thursday during the body-viewing ceremony. At least three people died after police fired gunshots and tear gas in an attempt to contain the huge crowds who had turned out to  escort Odinga's body from the country's main airport after it arrived from India where he died. The presidents of Somalia and Ethiopian are among regional leaders attending the funeral service at the Nyayo National Stadium. Obituary: A founding father of Kenya's multi-party democracyHow Odinga's court challenges have improved Kenya's electionsEarlier on Friday morning, Odinga's body was taken to parliament, where MPs and selected dignitaries viewed it.Odinga, a giant figure on Kenya's political scene, died on Wednesday aged 80 in India, where he had been receiving medical treatment.Mourners have been carrying branches and palm fronds, a symbol of mourning and grief among the Luo ethnic group to which Odinga belonged.On Saturday his body will be transported to Kisumu, a city in western Kenya on the shores of Lake Victoria - his political stronghold.Members of the public will get a chance to view the body before he is buried on Sunday at his farm in Bondo, about 60km (40 miles) west of Kisumu.According to the family, it was Odinga's wish to be laid to rest within the shortest time possible, ideally within 72 hours.A seven-day period of mourning has been declared.He was a towering figure in Kenyan politics and for many years was the country's main opposition leader, losing five presidential campaigns, most recently three years ago.Odinga repeatedly said he was cheated of victory, citing the manipulation of votes.",

Its English translation was published in 2024.A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line.

    "body": "Family of British girl missing for 55 years gives ultimatum to person of interest2 hours agoKaty WatsonAustralia correspondentThe family of a British girl who disappeared in Australia more than 50 years ago has threatened to name a key person of interest unless he comes forward to answer their questions.Authorities believe three-year-old Cheryl Grimmer was abducted from Fairy Meadow beach in Wollongong in January 1970.A suspect was charged with her abduction and murder, but his 2019 trial collapsed after a detailed confession made when he was teen was ruled inadmissible. He denies any wrongdoing.Known only as Mercury, the man's identity is protected as he was a minor at the time, but a politician has offered to name him under parliamentary privilege as the family pushes for a fresh investigation.\"[Mercury]'s got until Wednesday night,\" Cheryl's brother Ricki Nash told reporters on Friday.Jeremy Buckingham, a New South Wales parliamentarian who has been supporting the Grimmer family, said he's prepared to use parliamentary privilege to name the man when state parliament resumes sitting on Thursday.Mr Nash wants Mercury to explain to the family how he knew information contained in his confession - and if it was true or not.\"Enough is enough,\" he said, at times on the verge of tears. \"We want the truth to come out.\"Cheryl had been on the beach at Fairy Meadow with her family on 12 January 1970. When the family decided to pack up, Mr Nash, as the eldest brother, had been put in charge of his siblings and told to go to the bathroom block.Cheryl ran giggling into the ladies' changing rooms and refused to come out. Too embarrassed to enter himself, Mr Nash went back to the beach to tell his mother to help. When they returned, 90 seconds later, the toddler was gone.The family had only recently migrated to Australia from Bristol as so-called Ten Pound Poms.Despite extensive searches, there were no leads. Then in 2017, a man in his 60s was charged with Cheryl's abduction and murder after officers discovered a confession made to police by a teenage boy in 1971.A judge later ruled the confession could not be presented as trial evidence and the charges against him were dropped.On Friday, the family released a lengthy document detailing the missteps they say were made by authorities in NSW in the search for Cheryl, and called for more answers.\"We've made various requests to NSW authorities for a fresh prosecution or a fresh inquest but to no avail,\" the family said in the letter.\"We feel that we have been fobbed off numerous times by the police, saying that they're conducting reviews of the case or exploring leads that make no sense to us. The incompetence and negligence in the NSW police investigation of this case over much of the past 55 years is unfathomable.\"NSW Police have defended their conduct, reiterating that homicide detectives are still investigating Cheryl's disappearance - and that a A$1m reward for information remains on offer.\"Police continue to examine every line of inquiry and search for answers into Cheryl's death,\" NSW Police said in a statement.Three potential eyewitnesses came forward after the BBC aired the Fairy Meadow true crime podcast in 2022, which has since been downloaded five million times. Their contacts were passed on to investigators.But the family was recently told that a four-year-long review of the case found there was no new evidence that could lead to a conviction - even though the new potential eyewitnesses were not formally interviewed by officers.The family, alongside a volunteer team using cadaver detection dogs, also searched an \"area of interest\" they hoped would be a breakthrough in the case earlier this month. But police said that a subsequent search of the area only found animal bones.Cheryl's family disputes the police's response and said volunteers were back in the area on Friday, collecting soil samples to be sent to the UK and the US for further analysis.\"Cheryl disappeared more than 55 years ago. It's time for answers, it's time for accountability,\" the family said.It comes as the NSW parliament announced an inquiry into long-term missing persons cases in the state - including Cheryl's. It will look into how investigations have been carried out and ways of improvement.",

    "body": "Five takeaways from NYC mayoral debate as Mamdani and Cuomo clash 6 hours agoKayla EpsteinRockefeller Center,Grace Eliza GoodwinRockefeller Center andSakshi VenkatramanWatch: Sliwa, Mamdani and Cuomo debate grocery bills, Trump and Gaza The three leading candidates for New York City mayor took the stage at Rockefeller Center in Manhattan on Thursday to make a case to lead America's biggest city.Early voting in the race is set to begin next week, and the most recent polling suggests Zohran Mamdani has widened his lead to 46%, while Andrew Cuomo stands at 33%. The outcome of the race could have political implications beyond the Empire State as President Donald Trump looms large, and whoever wins will likely face pressure from Washington in some form.The Democratic Party nationally is likely watching to see if the America's biggest Democratic stronghold chooses an establishment, centrist figure in Cuomo - who is running as an independent - or the progressive Mamdani. The winner could help determine the kind of candidate and platform Democrats choose in the future following their staggering 2024 loss to Trump. Republicans also will watch to see if their candidate, Curtis Sliwa, continues to make inroads with his public safety platform.Here are five big takeaways from tonight's debate.Mamdani pressed on views on PalestiniansMamdani's past statements on Israel and Palestinians came up several times during the night in both questions from moderators and opponents' criticisms.The candidate has stressed his support for Palestinians and statehood, and has criticised Israel's military operation in Gaza.He also was criticised for declining to condemn the phrase \"globalise the intifada\" when probed by interviewers. Many Jews argue this slogan is an antisemitic call for violence, but pro-Palestinian activists say it is a call for international solidarity with Palestinians.Mamdani said he would seek to serve as a mayor for all New Yorkers, including its large and ideologically diverse Jewish population.Cuomo attacked Mamdani for his views, calling the New York state assemblyman a \"divisive personality across the board\".Angelina Katsanis/Pool via REUTERSThe fourth man: Donald TrumpThere were three candidates at tonight's debate but a fourth name kept coming up: Donald Trump.The president has implied he wants to send the National Guard into cities controlled by Democrats and has moved to withhold government funds for infrastructure projects in New York City. Trump has also prioritised the city for his mass deportation policy, and the mayor — who has little power over federal immigration enforcement — will likely have to weigh the city's response. Sliwa, the Republican, noted that the mayor would need to get along with Trump regardless of political views. But Mamdani made his opposition to the president explicit from his very first response, promising to \"take on Trump.\"Cuomo, meanwhile, positioned himself as the only candidate experienced enough to deal with the current White House, warning \"it will be Mayor Trump\" if Mamdani is elected.\"I fought Donald Trump,\" he told voters. \"When I'm fighting for New York, I am not going to stop.\"Affordability front and centreAs large as Trump looms, the biggest policy issue around this mayoral election is affordability. New Yorkers face high costs of living on everything - especially rent and groceries.In his opening statement, Sliwa acknowledged the \"really serious issues of affordability\" facing the city. He called for the next mayor to free up vacant apartments in NYCHA - New York's public housing programme — and allow people to move in.The moderators directly asked each candidate how much they paid for rent, groceries and whether they paid off credit card debt monthly. The candidates pitched a volley of proposals to tackle the cost of living, including Mamdani's plan to make buses free and Cuomo's proposal to place income limits on people who resided in rent-stabilised apartments.Cuomo criticised Mamdani for living in a rent-stabilised apartment -a form of affordable housing - even though his parents are wealthy (his mother is the filmmaker Mira Nair).Cuomo also opposed Mamdani's proposed rent freeze on stabilised apartments, saying it would only postpone future increases, force building owners into bankruptcy, and fail New Yorkers who don't live in rent-stabilised apartments.\"If you think that the problem in this city is that my rent is too low, vote for him,\" Mamdani said in response. \"If you know the problem in this city is that your rent is too high, vote for me.\"Former Governor Andrew Cuomo announces run for New York City mayorFULL COVERAGE: Mamdani, Cuomo, Sliwa debateWho is Zohran Mamdani?How Mamdani stunned New York - and what Democrats can learn from his winCuomo's controversies still loomCuomo touted his decades of experience in office, rising from federal housing secretary during President Bill Clinton's administration to New York governor.However, controversies surrounding his governorship have shadowed his campaign. He resigned as governor in 2021 after an investigation by the state attorney general found he had sexually harassed 11 women. Cuomo apologised for acting \"in a way that made people feel uncomfortable\" but denied allegations.The New York attorney general also investigated his administration for undercounting nursing home deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic, finding he understated the actual number of deaths.Mamdani attacked Cuomo on these matters, accusing him of \"sending seniors to their death in nursing homes,\" and accused him of lacking integrity.Cuomo said the allegations about harming seniors in nursing homes were \"totally false.\"\"During Covid, everyone did whatever they could in this state, and there have been numerous investigations where they've gone through it, and they said we followed federal guidance,\" Cuomo said. \"But yes, people died during Covid. And my heart breaks for everyone that broken, that died in this state and across this nation.\"Sliwa, too, attacked Cuomo for the \"lawsuits filed against you for sexual harassment.\" The former governor rebutted that the case brought by New York State Attorney General Letitia James, who investigated the misconduct claims, \"was political.\"Curtis Sliwa makes his markSliwa held his own as the only Republican on stage. His voting bloc might be in the minority in New York City, but the 2024 presidential election revealed that residents prioritise public safety issues and Sliwa hammered that repeatedly. As the founder of the Guardian Angels, a New York City organization devoted to crime prevention, he seized the opportunity to connect with voters.The longtime New York media and political personality knew how to make himself heard. He frequently interjected, telling moderators he wanted to speak, and elbowing his way into the debate's most heated moments. From centre stage, he took swings at both opponents in equal measure.He felt confident after the debate, saying his night went \"extraordinarily well\" and likening his opponents to \"two kids in the schoolyard.",

    "body": "EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has said a new anti-drone system should be \"fully operational by the end of 2027\", as part of a drive to toughen defences against Russia and be fully prepared for possible conflict by 2030.\"Drones are already redefining warfare. Having drone defences is no longer optional for anyone,\" Kallas said, referring to Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and fears that Moscow may attack the EU.The European Commission's \"defence roadmap\" also proposes strengthening the EU's eastern borders and building air and space \"shields\".Several EU nations have faced Russian incursions into their airspace and US President Donald Trump has urged the bloc to do more to defend itself.The European defence plan comes amid growing European fears that Russia will continue its westward aggression after the war in Ukraine is over, as well as continued ambiguity over Trump's long-term commitment to European security.\"Danger will not disappear even when the war in Ukraine ends. It is clear we need to toughen our defences against Russia,\" Kallas told reporters in Brussels on Thursday.Although there seems little chance of the war ending soon, Trump says he is now having a \"lengthy\" conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the phone, ahead of talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday. Trump has indicated that if Putin does not not move to end the war, the US could send Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles - a potential move already described as \"escalation\" by the Kremlin.Standing alongside Kallas, European Defence Commissioner Andrius Kubilius stressed that \"our roadmap shows all the major milestones to achieve defence readiness by 2030, so we can deter Russian aggression, prevent war and preserve peace\".Putin has repeatedly denied that Moscow has any aggressive plans towards the EU. In June, he said the \"myth that Russia is planning to attack Europe, Nato countries is an unbelievable lie... nonsense\".The EU's executive Commission said the 27-member union should be ready by 2030 to \"respond to any crisis, including high-intensity conflict\".It also urged the bloc to \"close critical capability gaps\" - including in air and missile defence, and artillery systems - \"through joint development and procurement\".Many EU countries are also members of Nato and its chief, Mark Rutte, said they were working together to protect member states on the eastern flank from aerial threat.The EU stressed its \"flagship\" projects would be developed in \"close co-ordination\" with Nato, and would not duplicate the Western defensive alliance's work.No estimates were given to the overall cost, but Kubilius said \"we're not talking here about hundreds of billions\".The \"defence roadmap\" still needs to be approved by member states at a leaders' summit next week. However, a number of EU states have already backed plans for a multi-layered \"drone wall\" to quickly detect, then track and destroy Russian drones.In recent weeks,  tensions have escalated between the EU and Russia, after Poland and Romania - both Nato members - said Russian drones had breached their airspace.And Estonia - another Nato member - in September requested urgent consultations  with other alliance members after saying that Russian warplanes had violated its airspace and stayed there for 12 minutes.Russia, which launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, said its planes were on a \"scheduled flight... in strict compliance with international airspace regulations and did not violate the borders of other states\".A number of European politicians and military experts have said that Russia's aim is to test Nato's capabilities and and try to sow discord within the alliance. Several Nato members reacted to the reported Russian incursions by sending troops, artillery, and air defence systems to secure the alliance's eastern flank.",

    "body": "12 hours agoKevin Nguyen,Phil Leake andMerlyn ThomasBBCThe controversial US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has confirmed it suspended operations in Gaza after the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas came into effect on 10 October.Despite being funded until November, the organisation said its final delivery was on Friday.The GHF has been heavily criticised after hundreds of Palestinians were killed while collecting food near its distribution sites. Witnesses say most were killed by Israeli forces.Israel has regularly denied that its troops fired on civilians at or near the sites and the GHF has maintained that aid distribution at its sites has been carried out \"without incident\".The group's northernmost aid distribution site, known as SDS4, was shut down because it was no longer in IDF-controlled territory, said a spokesman.Satellite imagery revealed it was dismantled shortly after the 10 October ceasefire came into effect. Images show tyre tracks, disturbed earth and detritus strewn across the former compound.\"Right now we're paused,\" the GHF spokesman said. \"We feel like there's still a need, a surge for as much aid as possible. Our goal is to resume aid distribution.\"Despite the group's apparent desire to continue there has been speculation the final terms of the ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel would exclude them.Meanwhile, analysis of UN-supplied data shows little change in aid collected from crossings after the ceasefire deal came into effect last Friday.The average amount of aid \"collected\" - defined by the UN as when it leaves an Israeli-controlled crossing - each day has increased slightly compared with the previous week, but it remains in line with September figures.UN data shows about 20% of aid leaving a crossing has made it to its intended destination since 19 May. More than 7,000 aid trucks have been \"intercepted\" either \"peacefully by hungry people or forcefully by armed actors\", according to UN data.Aid sources told the BBC they hoped looting would subside in coming weeks as law and order is re-established and the populace is given assurances the ceasefire would hold.A spokesperson from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said while it was critical for the ceasefire to allow for an increase in aid and other essential supplies, it was important to reach vulnerable Gazans, including in areas that were inaccessible until recently.OCHA has hundreds of community and household service points involved in distributing aid. It lost access to many, sometimes due to conflict and sometimes due to Israel denying it access.\"We need to re-establish our service points, we need looting to reduce, we need roads to be cleared of unexploded ordnance and we need safety assurances,\" the OCHA spokesperson said.",

    "body": "8 hours agoAna FaguyWashington andAoife WalshGetty ImagesBolton, who Trump fired from his first administration in 2019, has been a vocal critic of the presidentJohn Bolton, who served as Donald Trump's national security adviser before becoming a vocal critic of the president, has been criminally indicted on federal charges.The Department of Justice presented a case to a grand jury in Maryland on Thursday, and they agreed there was enough evidence to indict Bolton, who issued a statement maintaining his innocence.It comes after FBI agents searched Bolton's home and office in August as part of an investigation into the handling of classified information. The indictment makes Bolton, 76, the third of the US president's political opponents to face charges in recent weeks. He could face decades in prison.According to a 26-page indictment filed at a court in Greenbelt, Maryland, on Thursday, Bolton is charged with eight counts of transmission of national defence information (NDI) and 10 counts of unlawful retention of NDI.Prosecutors accuse him of illegally transmitting top secret information about US national defence using his personal email and other messaging apps. \"These documents revealed intelligence about future attacks, foreign adversaries, and foreign-policy relations,\" the court papers state.Watch: \"That's the way it goes\", says Trump on John Bolton's indictmentIf found guilty, Bolton could face up to 10 years in prison for each charge. He is expected to surrender to authorities on Friday.\"No one is above the law,\" US Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement announcing the charges. Bolton said in a statement that he looked forward to defending his \"lawful conduct\" in court as he accused Trump of seeking \"retribution against me\".\"Now, I have become the latest target in weaponizing the Justice Department to charge those he [Trump] deems to be his enemies with charges that were declined before or distort the facts,\" Bolton said.Bolton's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said the charges stemmed from diary entries kept by his client over his 45-year career in public service. \"Like many public officials throughout history, Amb Bolton kept diaries – that is not a crime,\" said Mr Lowell. He described the records as \"unclassified, shared only with his immediate family, and known to the FBI as far back as 2021\".According to CNN, Bolton is alleged to have shared the information with his wife and daughter. The unauthorised information includes \"diary-like entries from Bolton's time as the National Security Advisor\" and were allegedly \"printed and stored\" at Bolton's home in Bethesda, Maryland.Bolton was fired from Trump's first administration in 2019. His 2020 memoir, The Room Where It Happened, recounted his time working under Trump and portrayed him as a president who was ill-informed about geopolitics.The White House filed a lawsuit to block the book from being published, arguing it contained classified information and had not been properly vetted. A judge denied the request and the book was released days later.The US Department of Justice then opened an investigation into whether Bolton had mishandled classified information by disclosing certain information in the book. Asked about the indictment on Thursday at the White House, Trump said he did not know about it, but added that Bolton was \"a bad guy\". Watch: How the FBI raids on John Bolton's home and office unfoldedBolton, who served as George W Bush's UN ambassador, was among former officials critical of Trump who had their Secret Service protection stripped in January.He is the third Trump critic to be criminally charged since September. New York City Attorney General Letitia James was indicted on bank fraud charges in October. Former FBI director James Comey was charged in late September with lying to Congress.The cases were filed after Trump urged the US attorney general to prosecute his political opponents.\"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" he wrote on social media.",

    "body": "14 hours agoSean SeddonEPABenjamin Netanyahu addressed a memorial ceremony at the Mount Herzl cemetery in JerusalemIsrael's prime minister has told a memorial for victims of the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023 that he is \"determined\" to secure the return of the dead hostages still in Gaza, and that the country will continue to fight terrorism with \"full force\".Benjamin Netanyahu made the comments hours after Hamas returned the bodies of two more hostages but said it was not able to access the remaining 19.There has been fury in Israel that Hamas has not returned all the bodies in line with last week's Gaza ceasefire deal, though the US has downplayed the suggestion it amounts to a breach.Also on Thursday, Donald Trump signalled he was willing to see fighting resume if Hamas \"continues to kill people\".Writing on his Truth Social platform, the US president said \"we will have no choice but to go in and kill\", seemingly referencing reports of violence inside Gaza, where Hamas has been accused of violently targeting internal rivals in recent days. Trump has previously ruled out putting American soldiers on the ground in Gaza.Earlier on Thursday, the Israeli government confirmed that two bodies handed over by Hamas to the International Committee of the Red Cross on Wednesday night had been identified as Inbar Hayman and Sgt Maj Muhammad al-Atarash.Their return, which was overseen by masked Hamas gunmen in Gaza City, took the number of dead hostages returned since Monday to nine out of 28. All 20 living hostages were released on Monday, in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Hamas's military wing said on Wednesday that it would continue to search for the remaining bodies, but that it would require major efforts and specialist equipment.Israel has responded to the delay by threatening to restrict the amount of aid flowing into Gaza.On Thursday, Netanyahu addressed an official memorial ceremony at the Mount Herzl national cemetery in Jerusalem, two days after the Hebrew calendar anniversary of the 7 October attack.The prime minister said he remained committed to securing the return of all the dead Israeli and foreign hostages, and reiterated his government's willingness to return to military action if Israel was attacked again.He said: \"Our fight against terrorism will continue with full force. We will not allow evil to raise its head. We will exact the full price from anyone who harms us.\"The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 67,967 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.ReutersIsraeli Bedouin soldier Sgt Maj Muhammad al-Atarash was buried on Thursday, a day after his body was returned by HamasThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel said Netanyahu's government should \"immediately halt the implementation\" of the ceasefire deal until the 19 bodies were returned. After Hamas said it was unable to retrieve all the bodies, two senior advisers to US President Donald Trump said preparations to move to the next phase of the ceasefire deal were continuing. The advisers told reporters that the US government did not so far believe Hamas had broken the agreement by not retrieving more remains, and said the group had acted in good faith by sharing information with interlocutors.While the full text of the agreement between Israel and Hamas has not been made public, a leaked version which appeared in Israeli media appeared to allow for the possibility that not all of the bodies would be immediately accessible. One senior US adviser pointed to the level of destruction in Gaza as one reason the search might be slowed, and said rewards could be offered to civilians with information about the location of remains. Hamas has complained to mediators that more than 20 people have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza since the ceasefire took effect on Friday.Israel's military, which still controls more than half the territory, has said that it opens fire to remove threats to its troops.Watch: Netanyahu responds to Trump comment that he’s not \"the easiest\" to work withMeanwhile in Gaza, work is under way to identify the bodies of Palestinians returned by Israel in recent days in exchange for the hostages' bodies. A further 30 were returned on Thursday, taking the total to 120.There had been some reports that the Rafah crossing with Egypt would reopen on Thursday, having been shut since the Gaza side was seized by Israeli forces in May 2024.The ceasefire deal specifies its reopening would be \"subject to the same mechanism implemented\" during a temporary ceasefire earlier this year, when wounded Palestinians were briefly allowed to pass through to receive medical treatment.On Thursday, an official from Israeli military body Cogat said: \"The date for the opening of the Rafah crossing for the movement of people only will be announced at a later stage, once the Israeli side, together with the Egyptian side, completes the necessary preparations.\"The official also stressed that \"aid will not pass through the Rafah crossing\". Instead, they said, it would continue to enter Gaza through the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing in southern Israel and other crossings following Israeli security inspections.",

    "body": "38 minutes agoSean SeddonReutersZelensky is on his third visit to Washington since JanuaryUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet with US President Donald Trump in Washington on Friday, as Trump weighs whether to arm Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles capable of striking deep into Russia.Their meeting comes a day after Trump said \"great progress\" was made during a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, with the pair agreeing to face-to-face talks in Hungary.Trump said the call, the first with Putin since mid-August, was \"very productive\", adding that teams from Washington and Moscow will meet next week.As Zelensky arrived in the US, his third visit since January, he said Moscow was \"rushing to resume dialogue as soon as it hears about Tomahawks\".Zelensky has called on the US to provide Ukraine with the advanced missiles, which have a range of 2,500 km (1,500 miles).Asked earlier this week if Trump was considering giving Ukraine Tomahawks, he said: \"We'll see... I may.\" But asked about the same prospect after his call with Putin, Trump said \"we can't deplete\" the US stockpile of Tomahawks, adding \"we need them too... so I don't know what we can do about that\".Putin-Trump call a curveball for Zelensky ahead of his visitWriting on his Truth Social platform after his call with Putin concluded, Trump said he and the Russian president \"spent a great deal of time talking about Trade between Russia and the United States when the War with Ukraine is over\". He said \"high level advisors\" from both countries would meet at an unspecified location next week, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio leading the American delegation. Trump also said he would update Zelensky on his talks with Putin on Friday, adding: \"I believe great progress was made with today's telephone conversation.\"He later told reporters he expected to meet Putin in Hungary \"within two weeks\".Putin and Trump could speak a week after Rubio's meeting with advisors, Hungary's prime minister said.Viktor Orban told state radio he would speak to the Russian president later on Friday.\"Since the EU is pro-war, it is logical that it will be left out of this peace process,\" he said. The planned meeting in Budapest was \"great news for the peace-loving people of the world\", Orban wrote on X on Thursday, and he added that he had spoken to Trump by phone.Earlier, he also said: \"Peace requires patience, strength, and humility. Europe must shift its stance. Instead of arrogance and fanning the flames of endless war, we need negotiations with Russia. Only dialogue can bring peace to our continent.\"Hours before the Trump-Putin call, Russia launched one of its largest attacks of the year on Ukraine, including 28 ballistic missiles, and 320 drones, according to Ukraine's ambassador to the US, Olga Stefanishyna.Stefanishyna said Russia launching overnight strikes on Ukraine before the call \"exposes Moscow's real attitude toward peace\".In a statement to the BBC's US partner CBS, she added: \"These assaults show that Moscow's strategy is one of terror and exhaustion. The only effective response is pressure - through tougher sanctions, reinforced air defense, and the supply of long-range capabilities.\"Trump has taken a much tougher line towards Putin over the Ukraine war since a face-to-face summit in Alaska in August failed to produce a decisive breakthrough in attempts to broker a peace deal.The pair met on US soil on 15 August for a summit which the US president hoped would help convince the Russian president to enter comprehensive peace talks to end the Ukraine war. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.They spoke again days later when Trump interrupted a meeting with Zelensky and European leaders to call Putin.Since then, neither the White House or Kremlin have publicly confirmed any communications between the two.During his presidential election campaign, Trump claimed he would be able to end the war in Ukraine within days but has since admitted resolving the conflict has been more challenging than any he has been involved in since returning to power. Trump had been seen as more sympathetic to Russia than his predecessor Joe Biden, and strained relations with Zelensky came to a head on 28 February when he and Vice-President JD Vance berated the Ukrainian president in the Oval Office on live television. But public relations with Zelensky have vastly improved in recent months. In September, Trump signalled a major shift in his view of the conflict, saying he  believed Kyiv could \"win all of Ukraine back in its original form\", a far cry from his public calls for Kyiv to cede territory occupied by Russia. ReutersPutin and Trump last met in person at a US base in Alaska in August 2025In late July, Trump set Putin a deadline of less than a fortnight to agree to a ceasefire or face sweeping sanctions, including measures against countries which still trade with Russia.But he did not follow through the threat after Putin agreed to meet Trump in Alaska, which the US president hailed as a significant diplomatic success at the time, despite it not producing any tangible outcome.Earlier on Thursday, India's foreign ministry cast doubt on a claim made by Trump a day earlier saying Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had agreed to stop purchasing Russian oil.An Indian government spokesman said he was \"not aware of any conversation between the two leaders\" taking place the previous day, after Trump said Modi had assured him purchases would stop \"within a short period of time\".The US has pushed for countries - in particular India, China and Nato members - to stop buying Russian energy in an effort to increase economic pressure on the Kremlin. Zelensky has also repeatedly echoed those calls.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "19 hours agoHugh SchofieldIn ParisAFP via Getty ImagesSébastien Lecornu has had a turbulent start to his job, having resigned last week as prime minister before being reappointedFrance's new prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, has bought himself breathing space after winning two no-confidence motions tabled by the opposition.In the tightest vote, a motion sponsored by the far left fell 18 votes short of the 289 needed to bring him down. It means that after just five days in office, Lecornu has survived a first major ordeal in parliament and can now focus on the task of passing the 2026 budget.Any relief for the prime minister is likely to be short-lived, with the far left and far right still gunning to bring him down. And the Socialists, who threw a lifeline in the no-confidence motions, have made clear they will not be so indulgent next time round.Also, any tactical victory enabling the government to endure for now is more than offset by the huge damage to France's reputation caused by weeks of confusion and capitulation.Appointed by President Emmanuel Macron four weeks ago, then re-appointed in chaotic scenes on Friday after he resigned on Monday, Lecornu only survives thanks to major concessions made to the left.To buy the support of the Socialist Party, which has 65 or so MPs, the prime minister promised to freeze Macron's most important economic reform of his second term – the raising of the retirement age to 64.But he also made another, possibly more important, gift to the opposition, which has big implications for the chances of obtaining a budget in time for the end-of-year deadline.By pledging not to resort to the constitutional device known as the 49:3 – which lets governments force through laws without a vote – Lecornu handed ultimate control over the budget to the parties in parliament.It is a huge shift in power, reflecting the decline of presidential authority since Macron's botched parliamentary dissolution of July 2024.  For many observers  it heralds a return, for good or ill, to the party politicking that was a hallmark of the pre-1958 Fourth Republic.By assuring MPs that they and not the government would have the last word on the future budget, Lecornu managed to convince the Socialists that he was serious about marking a real \"rupture\" from previous Macronite administrations.But he may also have surrendered any prospect of the kind of belt-tightening debt reduction that the money markets and the European Union are demanding.The draft budget tabled by Lecornu on Tuesday aims to reduce the deficit to 4.7% of economic output (GDP) by making savings of €30bn (£26bn), with a squeeze on spending in the health sector and local administration.But the Socialists have joined the rest of the left and the far-right in denouncing the text as a betrayal of the less well-off.   Party leader Olivier Faure said that he would have no compunction about supporting a new vote of censure, if offending parts of the budget are not removed.AFP via Getty ImagesMathilde Panot's radical-left France Unbowed sponsored one of the two failed no-confidence motionsFrance's National Assembly has been split three ways for the last 15 months, with a centre-right bloc of under 200 MPs facing a left-wing alliance of about the same size and a far-right bloc of about 140, plus some independents.  None of the three prime ministers since then has been able to find a reliable majority.Weeks of bickering in Paris have triggered warnings about the public's growing disillusionment with politics - the spectacle appearing to confirm the notion that the prime aim of most politicians is simply to stay in power.President Macron, who is blamed for the crisis by most French voters, has seen his popularity ratings slump to just 14%. He has been in office for eight years, and the far right and far left have called for his resignation before his second term ends in 18 months.According to his one-time adviser, the veteran essayist and confidant of presidents Alain Minc, Macron \"must now go down as the worst president of the Fifth Republic\".Minc said Macron had come to office promising to act as a bulwark against the far right but he had left National Rally at the gates of power.\"If you look around us,\" said Minc, \"the Germans are petrified about what a French collapse will do to the economy. The British are petrified about the strategic implications. The Italians are laughing at us, because we always laughed at them.\"\"In America, President Trump is saying that smooth-talker Macron has got what he deserves. Only in Russia are they smiling.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterReutersLast week, China's Ministry of Commerce published a document that went by the name of \"announcement No. 62 of 2025\".But this wasn't just any bureaucratic missive. It has rocked the fragile tariffs truce with the US.The announcement detailed sweeping new curbs on its rare earth exports, in a move that tightens Beijing's grip on the global supply of the critical minerals - and reminded Donald Trump just how much leverage China holds in the trade war.China has a near-monopoly in the processing of rare earths - crucial for the production of everything from smartphones to fighter jets.Under the new rules, foreign companies now need the Chinese government's approval to export products that contain even a tiny amount of rare earths and must declare their intended use.In response, US President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods and put export controls on key software.\"This is China versus the world. They have pointed a bazooka at the supply chains and the industrial base of the entire free world, and we're not going to have it,\" said US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.On Thursday, China said the US had \"deliberately provoked unnecessary misunderstanding and panic\" over the rare earths restrictions.\"Provided the export licence applications are compliant and intended for civilian use, they will be approved,\" a commerce ministry spokesperson added.This week, the world's two biggest economies also imposed new port fees on each other's ships.The flare-up in the trade war brings to an end months of relative calm after top US and Chinese officials brokered a truce in May.Later this month, Trump and China's President Xi Jinping are expected to meet and experts have told the BBC the rare earths restrictions will give China the upper hand.China's new controls are bound to \"shock the system\" as they target vulnerabilities in American supply chains, said international business lecturer Naoise McDonagh from Australia's Edith Cowan University.\"The timing has really upset the kind of timeline for negotiations that the Americans wanted,\" he added.Getty ImagesRare earth minerals are crucial for the production of fighter jets like the F-35Rare earth minerals are essential for the production of a whole range of technology such as solar panels, electric cars and military equipment.For example, a single F-35 fighter jet is estimated to need more than 400kg (881.8lb) of rare earths for its stealth coatings, motors, radars and other components.China's rare earth exports also account for around 70% of the world's supply of metals used for magnets in electric vehicle motors, said Natasha Jha Bhaskar from advisory firm the Newland Global Group.Beijing has worked hard to gain its dominance of the global rare earth processing capacity, said critical minerals researcher Marina Zhang from the University of Technology Sydney.The country has nurtured a vast talent pool in the field, while its research and development network is years ahead of its competitors, she added.While the US and other countries are investing heavily to develop alternatives to China for supplies of rare earths, they are still some way from achieving that goal.With its own large deposits of rare earths, Australia has been tipped as a potential challenger to China. But its production infrastructure is still underdeveloped, making processing relatively expensive, Ms Zhang said.\"Even if the US and all its allies make processing rare earths a national project, I would say that it will take at least five years to catch up with China.\"The new restrictions expand measures Beijing announced in April that caused a global supply crunch, before a series of deals with Europe and the US eased the shortages.The latest official figures from China show that exports of the critical minerals were down in September by more than 30% compared to a year ago.But analysts say China's economy is unlikely to be hurt by the drop in exports.Rare earths make up a very small part of China's $18.7tn a year economy, said Prof Sophia Kalantzakos from New York University.Some estimates put the value of the exports at less than 0.1% of China's annual gross domestic product (GDP).While rare earths' economic value to China may be tiny their strategic value \"is huge\", she said, as they give Beijing more leverage in talks with the US.Despite accusing China of \"betrayal\", Bessent has left the door open to negotiations.\"I believe China is open to discussion and I am optimistic this can be de-escalated,\" he said.During a meeting with the US private equity group Blackstone's chief executive Stephen Schwarzman on Thursday, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi also highlighted the need for talks.\"The two sides should engage in effective communication, properly resolve differences and promote stable, healthy and sustainable development of China-US relations,\" Wang said, according to the ministry's website.What China has done recently is \"getting its ducks in a row\" ahead of those trade talks with the US, said Prof Kalantzakos.In curbing rare earth exports, Beijing has found its \"best immediate lever\" to pressure Washington for a favourable deal, Ms Bhaskar said.Getty ImagesTop US officials Scott Bessent and Jamieson Greer blasted China as \"unreliable\"Jiao Yang from Singapore Management University believes that although Beijing holds the cards in the short-run, Washington does have some strategic options at its disposal.The US could offer to lower tariffs, which is likely to be attractive to Beijing as the trade war has hit its manufacturers hard, said Prof Jiao said.China's economy is reliant on the income from the goods it makes and exports. The latest official figures show its exports to the US were down by 27% compared to a year ago.Washington can also threaten to hit China with more trade restrictions to hamper efforts to develop its technology sector, said Prof McDonagh.For example, the White House has already targeted China's need for high-end semiconductors by blocking its purchases of Nvidia's most advanced chips.But experts say that is likely to have only limited effects.Measures targeting Beijing's tech industry may slow China but won't \"stop it dead in the water,\" said Prof McDonagh.China has shown with its recent economic strategy that it is willing to take some pain to achieve its long-term goals, he added.\"China can carry on even if it costs a lot more under US export controls.\"But if China cuts off these rare earth supplies, that can actually stop everyone's industry. That's the big difference.\"",

    "body": "22 hours agoPaul GlynnCulture reporterBritish Library BoardThe date of Oscar Wilde's death, 30 November 1900, has been used as the new card's expiry dateThe British Library has honoured late Irish writer Oscar Wilde by reissuing a reader's card in his name, 130 years after his original was revoked following his conviction for \"gross indecency\".The celebrated novelist, poet and playwright was excluded from the library's reading room in 1895 over his charge for having had homosexual relationships, which was a criminal offence at the time.The new card, which will be collected by his grandson, author Merlin Holland, on Thursday, is intended to \"acknowledge the injustices and immense suffering\" Wilde faced, the library said.Mr Holland said the new card is a \"lovely gesture of forgiveness and I'm sure his spirit will be touched and delighted\".The British LibraryBritish Library papers from June 1895 noted: \"Mr O. Wilde excluded from the reading room\"The decision to revoke Wilde's pass for the library - then the British Museum reading room - was recorded without comment in the trustees' minutes for 15 June 1895.He had been in prison for three weeks at the time after being handed a two-year prison sentence with hard labour.The author was convicted after he lost a libel trial against Lord Queensberry, who had accused him of being homosexual after discovering that his son, Lord Alfred Douglas, aka Bosie, was Wilde's lover.The library regulations at the time said anyone convicted of a crime should have their card revoked.'Letter from prison meant so much'The British Library holds handwritten drafts of some of Wilde's most famous plays including The Importance of Being Ernest, An Ideal Husband, A Woman of No Importance and Lady Windermere's Fan.Its collection also includes De Profundis, the letter he wrote to Bosie from Reading Gaol.Mr Holland will collect the new card at a ceremony at the venue on what would have been his grandfather's 171st birthday.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday, Mr Holland said he felt both \"proud\" of his grandfather and slightly burderened by the responsibility of handling his legacy.\"People will so often write in to me and say, 'I cannot tell you how much your grandfather's De Profundis meant to me',\" he explained.\"It has a note of positivity at the end... he's going to come out of prison and do something again.\"And people have written to me saying, 'In a moment of terrible depression about my own life I read De Profundis, and I just wanted you to know that your grandfather's letter from prison meant so much to me'.\"British LibraryTrustees' papers noted Wilde's exclusion from the library at the timeDame Carol Black, chair of the British Library, described Wilde as \"one of the most significant literary figures of the nineteenth century\".She said that by reissuing his library card, \"we hope to not only honour Wilde's memory but also acknowledge the injustices and immense suffering he faced as a result of his conviction\".She added that they were \"delighted\" to welcome his grandson - who is the author of a new book, After Oscar: The Legacy of a Scandal - to receive the library card on his behalf.",

    "body": "8 hours agoGustavo Ocando AlexReporting from Maracaibo, Venezuela for BBC News MundoGustavo Ocando AlexWilder Fernández is a young fisherman in the west of Venezuela who is concerned by the US military presence in the CaribbeanWilder Fernández has caught four good-sized fish in the murky waters of a small bay north of Lake Maracaibo.The contents of his net will serve as dinner for his small team before they set out to go fishing again in the evening.But this daily task is a job he has recently become scared of doing.After 13 years as a fisherman, Mr Fernández confesses that he now fears his job could turn lethal.He is afraid he could die in these waters not at the hands of a night-time attacker - a threat fishermen like him encountered in the past - but rather, killed in a strike launched by a foreign power.\"It's crazy, man,\" he says of the deployment of US warships, fighter jets, a submarine and thousands of US troops in waters north of Venezuela's coast.The US force patrolling in the Caribbean is part of a military operation targeting suspected \"narco-terrorists\", which according to the White House have links to the Venezuelan government led by Nicolás Maduro.Since last month, the US has conducted at least six strikes on suspected drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean, with the latest being carried out on Thursday.At least 27 people have been killed, but Thursday's strike appeared to be the first to have survivors aboard the boat.The US has accused those killed of smuggling drugs but has so far not presented any evidence. Experts have suggested the strikes could be illegal under international law.Tensions between the US and Venezuela escalated further on Wednesday when US President Donald Trump said that he was considering strikes on Venezuelan soil.He also confirmed that he had authorised the CIA to carry out covert operations inside Venezuela.Gustavo Ocando AlexMany fishermen are wary of going out to sea given the new risks Mr Fernández is across the latest news. Even though the strikes are said by the US to have happened thousands of kilometres from where he fishes, his wife has been trying to convince him to leave Lake Maracaibo. Every day she begs him to leave his fishing job. \"She tells me to look for another job, but there's nowhere to go,\" he explains. He does not rule out that his boat could be hit \"by mistake\". \"Of course it worries me, you never know. I think about it every day, man,\" the father of three says.Read this story in Spanish at BBC MundoOne day after BBC Mundo spoke to Mr Fernández, Trump announced that \"six narco-terrorists\" had been killed in a US strike in international waters off the Venezuelan coast.Trump added that \"intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks\".ReutersThe US government has shared images of the boats it has attacked, saying that they originated in VenezuelaThe Trump administration accuses Maduro of leading the Cartel of the Suns drug trafficking gang and is offering a $50m (£37m) reward for information leading to his capture. Maduro, whose legitimacy as Venezuela's president is internationally contested after disputed elections last year, has denied the cartel accusations. He has dismissed them as an attempt by the White House to oust him from office. In his second televised address railing against the US in as many days, Venezuela's president said on Thursday: \"We will never be an American colony.\" Maduro also alleged the CIA had long been active in Venezuela.Meanwhile, Venezuela's Defence Minister General Vladimir Padrino has warned Venezuelans to prepare \"for the worst\". Speaking after the incursion on 2 October of five F-35 fighter jets in Venezuelan airspace, Gen Padrino said that his nation was facing a \"serious threat\", which he warned could involve \"aerial bombings, naval blockades, undercover commandos landing on Venezuelan beaches or in the Venezuelan jungle, swarms of drones, sabotage, and targeted killings of leaders\".Venezuela also denounced the \"mounting threats\" from the US at the United Nations Security Council last week. In response, the US representative at the UN meeting, John Kelley, stressed that his country \"will not waver in our action to protect our nation from narcoterrorists\".Gustavo Ocando AlexThe US government claims the attacked Venezuelan ships were transporting drugs, but has not presented evidenceMeanwhile, the attacks in the Caribbean have undermined the security of the fishermen in Venezuela, laments Jennifer Nava, spokeswoman for the Council of Fishermen in El Bajo, in Venezuela's Zulia state. Ms Nava tells BBC Mundo that people employed in the fishing industry fear being hit in the crossfire between US forces and alleged drug traffickers.AFP vía Getty ImagesThere are more than 115,000 people employed in the fishing sector in VenezuelaMs Nava argues that the added risks fishermen are facing could drive some of them into the arms of drug and arms smugglers looking to recruit people to transport their illicit shipments.\"Some of these guys are approached by traffickers,\" she explains, adding that a downturn in the fishing industry could leave fishermen more vulnerable to those approaches. There is certainly a sense of nervousness among the fishermen of Lake Maracaibo. Most of the crew of two small fishing boats owned by Usbaldo Albornoz refused to work when news of the US strikes broke.Mr Albornoz, who has been in the fishing business for 32 years, describes the situation as \"worrying\".\"The guys didn't want to go out to sea to fish,\" he told BBC Mundo on the beach in San Francisco de Zulia, which sits at the northern shore of Lake Maracaibo where it meets the Gulf of Venezuela.Gustavo Ocando AlexUsbaldo Albornoz says his employees have refused to go out and fishThe fear of being hit by a US strike is the latest of a long list of risks he and his men face, including pirates, oil spills and a decline in earnings in recent years, Mr Albornoz explains. In a leaked memo recently sent to US lawmakers, the Trump administration said it had determined it was involved in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug-trafficking organisations.The White House described the attacks on the boats in the Caribbean as \"self-defence\" in response to criticism by legal experts who said they were illegal.Gustavo Ocando AlexJosé Luzardo is defiant in the face of the US deploymentBut beyond the fear many are experiencing, there is also a feeling of defiance.At the end of September, hundreds of fishermen on dozens of boats took to Lake Maracaibo in a show of support for the Maduro government and in protest at the US military deployment. José Luzardo was one of them. A spokesman for the fishermen of El Bajo, he has been fishing for almost 40 years and accuses the US of \"pointing its cannons towards our Venezuela\".He says he is not afraid and would give his life to defend his homeland.Gustavo Ocando AlexFear of US strikes is just one of the issues threatening the fishing industry\"The Trump administration has us cornered. If we have to lay down our lives to defend the government, then we'll do it, so that this whole shebang is over,\" he says.He insists that what the fishermen want is \"peace and work\", not war, but gets visibly angry when he refers to the \"military barrier\" he says the US has deployed in the Caribbean.Last month, the Venezuelan government mobilised members of the militia and called on those who had not signed up to the civilian force to do so.More than 16,000 fishermen followed his call, according to fisheries minister Juan Carlos Loyo.Luzardo, who has been fishing since he was 11 years old says he will \"be ready for battle, wherever needed\".\"If they [the US] want to kill us, then so be it, but we're not afraid.\"",

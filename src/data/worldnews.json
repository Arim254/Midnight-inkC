    "body": "European Union leaders have struck a deal to give Ukraine a €90bn (£79bn; $105bn) loan after failing to agree on using frozen Russian assets.The agreement, which leaders said would meet Ukraine's military and economic needs for the next two years, came after more than a day of talks at a summit in Brussels. \"We committed, we delivered,\" EU chief Antonio Costa wrote on X as he announced the deal to provide a loan backed by the bloc's common budget. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had urged leaders to use €200bn of frozen Russian assets, but Belgium, where the vast bulk of the cash is held, demanded guarantees on sharing liability that proved too much for other countries.Zelensky said he was grateful to European leaders for the deal, which he described as \"significant support that truly strengthens our resilience\".Writing on X, he said it was important for Russian assets to remain \"immobilised\" and said: \"Thank you for the result and for unity\".In another development, French President Emmanuel Macron said he believed it would be \"useful\" for Europe to re-engage with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\"I believe that it's in our interest as Europeans and Ukrainians to find the right framework to re-engage this discussion,\" he said, adding that Europeans should find the means to do so \"in coming weeks\".EU ⁠leaders avoided \"chaos ‍and ‍division\" ​with ‌their decision to provide Ukraine with a loan through borrowing cash rather than ​use frozen Russian assets, Belgian Prime Minister Bart De ​Wever said early on Friday.\"We remained united,\" De ‌Wever added. Ukraine is months from running out of cash and Zelensky said without an injection by spring Ukraine would \"have to reduce production of drones\".The EU estimates Ukraine needs an extra €135 billion to stay afloat over the next two years, with the cash crunch set to start in April.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who had pushed for the asset plan, said the final decision on the loan \"sends a clear signal\" to Putin.Russia had warned EU leaders not to use its money, but Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said they had to \"rise to this occasion\".The agreement offers Kyiv a desperately needed lifeline amid a flurry of diplomacy as US President Donald Trump pushes for a quick deal to end Russia's war.US and Russian officials are due to meet in Miami this weekend for further talks on a peace plan, a White House official has told AFP news agency. It is thought Kremlin envoy Kirill Dmitriev will talk to Trump envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Miami.Meanwhile, Zelensky announced Ukrainian and US delegations would hold new talks on Friday and Saturday in the United States.He said he wanted Washington to give more details on the guarantees it could offer to protect Ukraine from another invasion.",

    "body": "23 hours agoHugh Schofield,ParisandLaura GozziA former anaesthetist has been jailed for life for intentionally poisoning 30 patients, 12 of them fatally.Frédéric Péchier, 53,  was convicted Friday at the end of a four-month trial in the eastern city of Besançon.In one of France's biggest ever medical malpractice cases, Péchier was found to have introduced chemicals like potassium chloride or adrenaline into the infusion bags of patients. His youngest victim, a four-year-old child, survived two cardiac arrests during a routine tonsil surgery in 2016. The oldest victim was 89.\"You are Doctor Death, a poisoner, a murderer. You bring shame on all doctors,\" said prosecutors last week. \"You have turned this clinic into a graveyard.\"The chemicals Péchier added triggered cardiac arrest or haemorrhaging in patients, which required emergency intervention in the operating theatre.This was often provided by Péchier himself, who was then able to pose as the patient's saviour.But in 12 cases he was unable to intervene, or it was too late, and the patient died.The prosecution argued that Péchier acted in order to discredit fellow anaesthetists against whom he bore a grudge.In most of the operations, he was not the primary anaesthetist. It was alleged he came in early to the clinic to tamper with the infusion bags.Then, when things went wrong, he was able to step in after diagnosing the problem and ordering an antidote.Péchier was first placed under investigation eight years ago, when he was suspected of poisoning patients at two clinics in Besançon between 2008 and 2017. The alert was raised in 2017 after a surfeit of potassium chloride was found in the infusion bag of a woman who had a heart attack while being operated on for a back complaint.Investigators found a pattern of \"serious adverse events\" at the Saint-Vincent private clinic in Besançon. While the national average for fatal heart attacks under anaesthetic was 1 in 100,000, at the clinic it was more than six times that.And in most cases nationally, an explanation for the heart attack was subsequently found, whereas at Saint-Vincent the cause remained a mystery.It was also found that the \"serious adverse events\" ceased when Péchier left for a short period to work at another clinic, which itself then saw an uptick. Then when he returned to Saint-Vincent, the emergencies resumed there. When he was disbarred from practising in 2017, the anomaly stopped.Péchier's first known victim, Sandra Simard, was 36 when she experienced a sudden cardiac arrest in the middle of spine surgery. She survived thanks to intervention by Péchier, although she went into a coma. Tests on her infusion bags showed concentrations of potassium 100 times the expected dose and the alarm was sounded with local prosecutors. During the 15 weeks of the trial, Péchier sometimes acknowledged that some of the patients who fell ill or died may have been poisoned but he denied any wrongdoing. \"I have said it before and I'll say it again: I am not a poisoner... I have always upheld the Hippocratic oath,\" he stated. Péchier will now spend a minimum of 22 years behind bars, having been at liberty throughout the trial.He has 10 days to lodge an appeal, which would entail a second trial within a year.According to the trial prosecutor: \"His colleagues said he always seemed to have the answer. That he made himself out to be the best, that he created this character of the saviour, so that colleagues would instinctively turn to him.\"Péchier denied the charges and his lawyers argued that there was no hard proof linking him to the crimes. But his own testimony varied in the trial, and he ended up admitting there must have been a poisoner at large in the clinic, but it was not him.The son of two parents in the medical profession, Péchier was described by a court psychologist as having a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde personality – one side respectable, the other side capable of doing great harm. In 2014 and again in 2021 he made attempts to kill himself.A divorced father of three children, he told the court before the verdict that his sole concern was to protect his family. His children wept as the sentence was read but he remained impassive.\"It's the end of a nightmare,\" said survivor Sandra Simard. Another patient who survived, Jean-Claude Gandon, said: \"We can have an easier Christmas now.\"",

    "body": "19 hours agoPritti MistryBusiness reporterThe firm behind President Donald Trump's Truth Social platform is merging with a Google-backed energy company in a deal valued at more than $6bn (£4.4bn).Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) and TAE Technologies announced the plans on Thursday in a joint statement, which said the move would \"create one of the world's first publicly traded fusion companies\".Fusion power is a method of generating energy from heat released by nuclear fusion reactions. It could release vast amounts of energy with little associated radioactivity.The statement said the combined company planned to begin constructing the \"world's first utility-scale fusion power plant\" next year, with further plants to follow.Under the merger both firms will have an equal 50% share in ownership after the deal is completed, which is expected by mid-2026 pending regulatory and shareholder approvals.The combined company will have a nine-member board including Trump Media's current chief executive Devin Nunes, who will be co-chief executive of the new firm, and the president's son Donald Trump Jr.TAE Technologies provides technology for energy storage and power delivery systems for batteries and electric vehicles. Its umbrella organisation, TAE Life Sciences, develops technologies and drugs for treating cancer patients.The tie-up with the firm signals a bold and surprising shift for Trump Media, as it moves from social media and financial offerings into the energy sector. Mr Nunes said his firm was \"taking a big step forward toward a revolutionary technology that will cement America's global energy dominance for generations\". Calling fusion power the \"most dramatic energy breakthrough\" since the 1950s, he said Trump Media would bring \"the capital and public market access\" to help make TAE's technology commercial viable. As part of the agreement, Trump Media is to provide up to $200m (£149m) of cash to TAE Technologies when completion of the deal is signed. An additional $100m (£74.7m) will be available once the transaction has been registered.Surging electricity demand for AI data centers has revived interest in cleaner and reliable nuclear power, including restarting shuttered reactors, expanding existing ones and signing contracts for future small modular reactors.The joint statement said TAE Technologies had raised more than $1.3bn of funding from other investors including Google and Goldman Sachs.Trump Media, which mainly generates revenue from advertising on the Truth Social platform, has consistently clocked losses since it began. It posted a decline in revenue and a loss of $54.8m (£40.9m) in the third quarter ending September.",

    "body": "Pope Leo has named Bishop Aldon Ronald Hicks who, like the pope, is from the Chicago area and served in Latin America, as the next archbishop of New York.Bishop Hicks, 58, will lead one of the Roman Catholic Church's most populous and important postings in the US.He replaces retiring Cardinal Timothy Dolan, 75, who was seen as a conservative with close ties to President Donald Trump. Hicks said he accepted his appointment, which was announced on Thursday, with \"an open heart\" and Dolan called it \"an early Christmas gift\" for New Yorkers.Last month, Hicks joined other bishops to condemn the Trump administration's large scale immigration-related arrests as part of its mass deportation agenda.Hicks' early life and pastoral career closely mirror Pope Leo's. He grew up in South Holland, a short distance from Leo's Dolton neighbourhood in the suburb of Chicago. While Pope Leo spent two decades as a missionary in Peru, Hicks worked at an orphanage in El Salvador from 2005 to 2010, according to a biography released by the New York archdiocese. Hicks was appointed bishop of Joliet by Pope Francis in 2020.Like the pope, Hicks has been outspoken about his concerns for immigrants. \"Deeply rooted in our Gospel tradition of loving our neighbor, this letter affirms our solidarity with all our brothers and sisters as it expresses our concerns, opposition, and hopes with clarity and conviction,\" he said, in response to a joint-letter written by US bishops expressing concerns about the situation immigrants in the United States face.\"It is grounded in the Church's enduring commitment to the Catholic social teaching of human dignity and a call for meaningful immigration reform,\" he saidThe Trump administration has carried out large scale immigration arrests in the Chicago area, leading to clashes between federal agents and residents protesting their presence.The bishops' letter comes as churches grapple with how to respond to immigration activity that affects their members. The majority of people at risk of deportation are Christians, with 61% of the at-risk group being Catholics, according to a report by the US Catholic Bishops Conference.Hicks will now leave his position as bishop of Joliet for the ornate sanctuary at St Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan, where he will lead 2.5 million Catholics in the nation's largest city. He will officially be installed at the cathedral on 6 February 2026.His appointment comes a week after Cardinal Dolan, who has served in New York City for about 16 years, announced the archdiocese will set up a $300 million fund to settle claims of clergy sex abuse.\"As a church, we can never rest in our efforts to prevent abuse, to protect children and to care for survivors,\" the incoming archbishop said at a news conference. \"While this work is challenging, it's difficult, it's painful, I hope it will continue to help in the areas of accountability, transparency and healing.\"Cardinal Dolan, of Missouri, announced his resignation in February, as required by church law when bishops turn 75. He was named head of the church in New York by Pope Benedict XVI in 2009, who later made him cardinal.He participated in two conclaves, one that elected Pope Francis in 2013 and the second that elected Leo XIV last May. The cardinal led prayers at both of Trump's inaugurations, and was appointed by the president to the new Religious Liberty Commission earlier this year.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump has suspended the US green card lottery scheme in the wake of a mass shooting at Brown University last week in which two people were killed.The suspect, a Portuguese man who was found dead on Thursday, entered the country through the diversity lottery immigrant visa programme (DV1) in 2017 and was granted a green card.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said she has paused the visa scheme under Trump's direction to \"ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous programme\".US officials said they believe the suspect, 48-year-old Claudio Neves Valente, also killed Portuguese Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Nuno Loureiro earlier this week.The programme makes up to 50,000 visas available each year through a random selection process among entries from countries with low rates of immigration to the US.Writing on social media, Noem said Trump had previously \"fought to end\" the scheme in 2017 after eight people were killed in a truck-ramming attack in New York City.Uzbekistan national Sayfullo Saipov, an Islamic State supporter who is serving multiple life sentences for the attack, entered the US through the DV1 scheme, according to Noem.Her comments come just hours after Neves Valente was found dead in a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire, from what police believe is a self-inflicted gunshot wound.Police said video evidence and tips from the public led investigators to a car rental location where they found the suspect's name and matched him to their person of interest, following a six-day multi-state manhunt.He was found dead with a satchel and two firearms. Evidence in a car nearby matched to the scene of the shooting at Brown University in Providence, according to Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha.Brown University President Christina Paxson said Neves Valente was enrolled at the Ivy League school from the autumn of 2000 to the following spring, and was studying for a PhD in physics.He had \"no current active affiliation\" to Brown, she said.Officials said they believe Neves Valente shot and killed MIT professor Nuno F Gomes Loureiro, 47, on Monday at his home in Brookline, which is about 50 miles (80km) from Providence.Both men had studied at the same university in Portugal in the late 1990s, police said.Officials said the cases were linked when the suspect's vehicle was identified via CCTV footage and a witness at Brown University.The same car was spotted near the scene of the professor's shooting, which happened just two days later.Authorities have not provided any suspected motive for either of the attacks.Two students were killed and nine others were injured as a gunman burst into Brown University's engineering building on 13 December and opened fire during final exams.They have been identified as Ella Cook, 19, a second-year student from Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, 18, an Uzbek-American who had just started at the university.",

    "body": "A former Nascar driver and his family were among the seven people killed in a plane crash at a regional airport in North Carolina, the car-racing organisation has said.A highway patrol spokesman said people on the ground confirmed that Greg Biffle was among those who boarded the plane.The Cessna C550 crashed while landing at Statesville Regional Airport around 10:20 local time (15:20GMT), officials investigating the incident told reporters.\"Greg was more than a champion driver, he was a beloved member of the NASCAR community, a fierce competitor, and a friend to so many,\" Nascar said in a statement where it confirmed Biffle had died along with his wife, daughter, son, and three others.\"His passion for racing, his integrity, and his commitment to fans and fellow competitors alike made a lasting impact on the sport,\" the company added.Beyond the racetrack, Biffle was remembered for helping in North Carolina in the aftermath of last year's Hurricane Helene, when he used his personal helicopter to rescue stranded residents and deliver supplies.Tributes to the former racer poured in on Thursday. \"Heartbreaking news out of Statesville,\" North Carolina Governor Josh Stein posted on X. \"Beyond his success as a NASCAR driver, Greg Biffle lived a life of courage and compassion and stepped up for western North Carolina after Hurricane Helene.\" Motorsport YouTuber Garrett Mitchell wrote on Facebook that Biffle and his family were on their way to spend the afternoon with him.\"Unfortunately, I can confirm Greg Biffle, his wife Cristina, daughter Emma, and son Ryder were on that plane… because they were on their way to spend the afternoon with us,\" he wrote on Facebook.  \"We are devastated. I'm so sorry to share this.\"Statesville Airport Director John Ferguson described the aircraft as a corporate jet and said it was already engulfed in flames when he arrived on the scene.The Cessna C550 aircraft is owned by a private company associated with Biffle, CBS, the BBC's US partner, reported.The jet took off around 10:06 local time and was in the air briefly before it crashed on the east end of the runway. Authorities are investigating the cause of the crash.Statesville Airport will remain closed until further notice as crews clear debris off the runway, Mr Ferguson told reporters.Officials did not provide any information about deaths or people aboard the aircraft during their first media conference.The National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation has sent in a team to investigate the fatal crash. The Statesville Regional Airport (KSVH) is owned by the City of Statesville, which is about 45 minutes north of Charlotte. It also provides aviation facilities for Fortune 500 companies and several Nascar racing teams. Biffle, whose racing career spanned two decades, was named one of Nascar's 75 Greatest Drivers in 2023. The 55-year-old won 19 Cup Series races in the Xfinity Series and Craftsman Truck Series. Known as The Biff, the Vancouver, Washington, native received national notice in 1995 during that year's Nascar Winter Heat Series, according to his Nascar profile.He made a name for himself in the Craftsman Truck Series, winning the 1998 Rookie of Year award and the 2000 series championship.He went on to be named 2001 Rookie of the Year in the Xfinity Series and to win the 2002 championship, becoming the first driver with championships in both the Xfinity Series and the Truck Series.He also co-founded the organisation's Sand Outlaws Series. Although he scaled back on racing after 2016, he seemingly came out of retirement in 2019 for a one-off race at Texas Motor Speedway, which he won.\"Racing is racing,\" he told Nascar.com in 2021. \"It's that adrenaline, you want to be better than the competition, you want to build a better piece and have a faster car. I just enjoy the competition.\"",

It came hours before the 19 December deadline for the Department of Justice to release all files related to its investigation into Epstein. \"These new images raise more questions about what exactly the Department of Justice has in its possession,\" said ranking member of the committee, Robert Garcia.What's in the images releasedSome of the photos released on Thursday show Epstein speaking with professor and activist Noam Chomsky aboard a private plane; Bill Gates standing beside a woman whose face is redacted; Steve Bannon sitting at a desk across from Epstein, and former Alphabet president Sergey Brin at a dinner event. The BBC has attempted to contact each for comment.These are the latest wealthy, powerful men to be seen in Epstein estate photos released by the House Oversight Committee - previously released photos also show US President Donald Trump and former president Bill Clinton, as well as film director Woody Allen, former US treasury secretary Larry Summers, attorney Alan Dershowitz, former prince Andrew Mountbatton-Windsor, and others. Appearing in the photos is not evidence of any wrongdoing, and many of the pictured men have said they were never involved in Epstein's illegal activity. House Oversight CommitteeIn a statement accompanying the photo release, Democrats on the US House Oversight Committee said the Epstein estate did not provide context or timings for the pictures. \"Photos were selected to provide the public with transparency into a representative sample of the photos received from the estate, and to provide insights into Epstein's network and his extremely disturbing activities,\" the statement says.The release also includes several photos of quotes from the Vladimir Nabokov novel Lolita written in black ink across different parts of a woman's body, like her chest, foot, hipbone, and back. Lolita tells the story of a young girl who was groomed by a middle-aged literature professor.One quote from the book written across a woman's chest reads, \"Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth\". House Oversight CommitteeThere are also a number of photos of female passports and identification documents from countries around the world, including Lithuania, Russia, the Czech Republic, and Ukraine.  Most of the information on the documents, like names and birth dates, is redacted but the House Oversight Committee said in a press release that the passports belong to \"women whom Jeffrey Epstein and his conspirators were engaging\".Another photo shows Epstein sitting at a desk closely surrounded by three female figures whose faces have been redacted - one has her hand on Epstein's chest under his shirt, and another is crouching to look at a nearby laptop. Epstein appears to be helping the third put on a bracelet. House Oversight CommitteeAnother image released is a screenshot of text messages from an unknown person who says they have been sent \"some girls\" and are asking for \"$1000 per girl\". House Oversight CommitteePhoto release comes ahead of DOJ deadlineThe committee has thousands of images in its possession from the Epstein estate, which are \"both graphic and mundane\", its statement on Thursday explained. The House Oversight Committee first subpoenaed the estate of Epstein, who died in a New York prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on allegations of sex trafficking, in August. The photos and files the Epstein estate gave to the committee are separate from what is largely referred to as \"the Epstein files\". Those are documents within the justice department's possession related to its own investigation into Epstein. Under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which President Trump signed into law last month, the DOJ has until 19 December to release its files. The extent of what's contained in the DOJ's files is unknown, and it's likely that much of the content will be heavily redacted, similar to House Oversight Committee materials. ",

    "body": "Wiz Khalifa sentenced to nine months jail in Romania for smoking cannabis on stage16 hours agoMircea Barbu,BucharestandAndré Rhoden-PaulGetty ImagesA Romanian court has sentenced Wiz Khalifa to nine months in prison for smoking cannabis on stage.The American rapper, real name Thomaz Cameron Jibril, admitted to smoking a joint during his performance at the Beach, Please! festival last year in Costinesti.A Romanian appeals court overturned an earlier fine of 3,600 Romanian lei (£619; $829) for drug possession and ruled the rapper must serve the sentence in custody. However he was sentenced in absentia. Earlier this week he was seen on stage performing with Gunna in California, and on Thursday he posted pictures and clips from his home on streaming platform Twitch and social media.The BBC has approached the ten-time Grammy-nominated artist for comment. Police briefly held and questioned Jibril after the concert on 13 July 2024, and prosecutors later charged him with possession of \"risk drugs\" for personal use.  Romanian investigators said he was in possession of more than 18 grams of cannabis and consumed an additional amount on stage. In a written decision, the Constanța Court of Appeal judges said they overturned the original fine because the artist had sent \"a message of normalisation of illegal conduct\" and thereby encouraged \"drug use among young people\".Calling it an \"ostentatious act\", the judges said the rapper was \"a music performer, on the stage of a music festival well known among young people\" who \"possessed and consumed, in front of a large audience predominantly made up of very young people, an artisanal cigarette\".Jabril said in a post on X a day after the incident that he did not mean to offend the country. \"They [the authorities] were very respectful and let me go. I'll be back soon. But without a big ass joint next time.\" Romanian criminologist Vlad Zaha told BBC News that there was little-to-no chance of the US extraditing Jibril, and described the sentence as \"unusually harsh\". \"Given the defendant's wealth and connections, Romania's lack of real negotiating power on extradition, and the legal and political status of cannabis in the US, it is highly unlikely that Wiz Khalifa will be sent to serve a prison sentence in Constanța, even though a formal judicial request will be submitted to the United States,\" Mr Zaha said. The  artist, known for songs like Black and Yellow, See You Again and Young, Wild & Free, is often pictured smoking on his social media and founded his own marijuana brand in 2016. Cannabis is legal recreational and medical use in some US states, but remains illegal under federal law.",

    "body": "22 hours agoSofia Ferreira SantosAPArnett reported on the Vietnam and Gulf Wars during his career (pictured here in Saigon, Vietnam, in 1963) Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and war correspondent Peter Arnett has died at the age of 91, US media has reported.Arnett won the international reporting prize in 1996 for his Vietnam War coverage at the Associated Press (AP). But he was also well known for his work at CNN, having become a household name while reporting on the first Gulf War.His career spanned decades and covered several conflicts in countries including Iraq, Vietnam and El Salvador.The New Zealand-born journalist died on Wednesday surrounded by family and friends in California, his son told reporters. He was receiving hospice care for prostate cancer.APArnett also took photographs while on assignment with troops - like this one from Vietnam in 1965Arnett first worked for AP as a wire-service correspondent in Vietnam, from 1962 until the war's end in 1975, often accompanying troops on missions.At a talk in 2013, he recalled the moment he witnessed a soldier being shot in Vietnam as he paused to read a map.\"As the colonel peered at it, I heard four loud shots as bullets tore through the map and into his chest, a few inches from my face,\" Arnett told the American Library Association.\"He sank to the ground at my feet.\"APHis reporting and photographs, including this one of workers in Ho Chi Minh City in 1972, showed the reality on the groundThe journalist left AP in 1981 to join US outlet CNN, where he later became known for his work on the first Gulf War.He was one of the few Western reporters to stay in Baghdad, according to AP, with one of his first broadcasts from the city being interrupted by the sounds of missiles and air-raid sirens.\"There was an explosion right near me, you may have heard,\" he once exclaimed live on-air.While in Iraq, he interviewed then-president Saddam Hussein. Writing about the experience in the Roanoke Times, Arnett said he had decided to be \"as tough in my questioning as the situation would allow\".He continued: \"I was not intimidated by the prospect of encountering the man many had called 'The Butcher of Baghdad'. I figured he could do no worse to me than the constant bombing of Baghdad was threatening to do.\"APArnett visited Pyongyang, North Korea, in 1979, taking this photograph of children performing for then-UN Secretary General Kurt WaldheimIn 1997, Arnett became the first Western journalist to interview Osama Bin Laden at a secret hideout in Afghanistan, a few years before the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US.According to several US media reports, when asked about his plans, Bin Laden told Arnett: \"You'll see them and hear about them in the media, God willing.\"Arnett later worked for NBC and was famously sacked by the broadcaster after giving an interview on Iraqi state television, in which he was seen as critical of US military strategy.He was hired by the Daily Mirror hours later and said he was \"in shock\" at his dismissal.\"I report the truth of what is happening here in Baghdad and will not apologise for it,\" he wrote in the UK paper.APArnett provided an inside-look of what was happening in Vietnam throughout his careerBorn in 1934 in Riverton, New Zealand, Arnett later naturalised as an American citizen and had lived in southern California since 2014.Edith Lederer, a former colleague who still works at AP, told the agency: \"Peter Arnett was one of the greatest war correspondents of his generation - intrepid, fearless, and a beautiful writer and storyteller.\"His reporting in print and on camera will remain a legacy for aspiring journalists and historians for generations to come.\"Meanwhile, Nick Ut, a retired photographer who worked with Arnett in Vietnam, said he was \"like a brother\".\"His death will leave a big hole in my life,\" he told AP.Arnett is survived by his wife Nina Nguyen and their children, Andrew and Elsa.",

    "body": "2 hours agoAnbarasan Ethirajan,Global Affairs Correspondent,Toaha Faroque,BBC Bangla, DhakaandKelly NgWatch: Large crowd burns rubble after death of Bangladesh youth protest leaderStaff at two leading Bangladeshi newspapers say they were \"gasping for air\" as protesters, roused by the death of a prominent activist, set their offices alight on Thursday.Sharif Osman Hadi, who had emerged as a key figure after last year's anti-government protests that ousted former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, was shot in Dhaka last week and died of his injuries on Thursday.Hundreds of protesters stormed the offices of English newspaper The Daily Star and Bengali daily Prothom Alo on Thursday night and the demonstrations extended into the next day.\"It is one of the darkest days for independent journalism in Bangladesh,\" the English language Daily Star said in a statement.For the first time in 35 years, The Daily Star could not publish its print edition on Friday and will be \"inoperable for a while\", consulting editor Kamal Ahmed told the BBC.\"Twenty-eight of our colleagues were trapped in the rooftop of the building for hours... They were gasping for fresh air,\" Ahmed said. \"They were rescued only after additional military reinforcement came.\"No one has been seriously injured, but large parts of the buildings were completely charred when BBC Bangla visited on Friday. Smoke was still seen coming out of Prothom Alo's building.The interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus condemned the violence, vowing to hand perpetrators \"full justice\".\"Attacks on journalists are attacks on truth itself,\" it said in a statement on Friday. The country is making a \"historic democratic transition\", it said, which must not be derailed by \"those few who thrive on chaos and reject peace.\"Bangladesh is scheduled to hold elections next February, the first since Hasina's ousting.It is unclear why the hundreds of protesters targeted The Daily Star and Prothom Alo, which have long been regarded as secular and progressive. Because of that, they often came under fire during Hasina's administration.However, since the July 2024 uprising, the two newspapers have maintained their critical stance on some of the interim government's policies, which may have angered supporters of Yunus' administration. Other prominent buildings, including the home of the country's first president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who was Hasina's father, were also vandalised and set on fire on Thursday.Sharif Osman Hadi's Facebook pageSharif Osman Hadi was a key figure in the youth movement that topped Sheikh HasinaHadi, 32, was a senior leader of the student protest group Inqilab Mancha, and part of the youth movement that topped Hasina. He was also a vocal critic of neighbouring India, where Hasina remains in self-imposed exile.Hadi made regular appearances on various media programmes after last year's protest and quickly attracted a wide following - as well as a steady pool of opponents.Hadi had planned to contest in next February's election as an independent candidate, but was shot one day after authorities announced the date for the poll.He was gunned down by masked attackers while leaving a mosque in Dhaka on 12 December. He succumbed to his injuries at a hospital in Singapore.Yunus called Hadi's death \"an irreparable loss for the nation\" and called it a premeditated attack by those conspiring to \"derail\" the election.\"The country's march toward democracy cannot be halted through fear, terror, or bloodshed,\" he said in a televised speech on Thursday.The interim government has declared a day of national mourning on Saturday.Investigations are ongoing and several people have been detained over the shooting.Hasina fled to India in August 2004, following weeks of student-led protests, bringing an end to 15 years of increasingly authoritarian rule.In November, she was sentenced to death for crimes against humanity after being found guilty of allowing lethal force to be used against protesters, 1,400 of whom died during the unrest.",

    "body": "5 hours agoPeter Hoskins,Business reporterandLily Jamali,North America technology correspondentWatch: What does TikTok's deal mean for America's users?TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance has signed binding agreements with US and global investors to operate its  business in America, TikTok's boss told employees on Thursday.Half of the joint venture will be owned by a group of investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake and the Emirati investment firm MGX, according to a memo sent by chief executive Shou Zi Chew.The deal, which is set to close on 22 January, would end years of efforts by Washington to force ByteDance to sell its US operations over national security concerns.It is in ​line with a deal unveiled in September, when US President Donald Trump delayed the enforcement of a law that would ban the app unless it was sold.In the memo, TikTok said the deal will enable \"over 170 million Americans to continue discovering a world of endless possibilities as part of a vital global community\".Under the agreement, ByteDance will retain 19.9% of the business, while Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX will hold 15% each.Another 30.1% will be held by affiliates of existing ByteDance investors, according to the memo.The White House previously said that Oracle, which was co-founded by Trump supporter Larry Ellison, will license TikTok's recommendation algorithm as part of the deal.The deal comes after a series of delays.In April 2024, during President Joe Biden's administration, the US Congress passed a law to ban the app over national security concerns, unless it was sold.The law was set to go into effect on 20 January 2025 but was pushed back multiple times by Trump, while his administration worked out a deal to transfer ownership.Trump said in September that he had spoken on the phone to China's President Xi Jinping, who he said had given the deal the go ahead.The platform's future remained unclear after the leaders met face to face in October.The app's fate was clouded by ongoing tensions between the two nations on trade and other matters.\"TikTok has become a bargaining chip in the wider US-China relationship,\" said Alvin Graylin, a lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\"With recent softening tensions, Beijing's sign off on the structure and algorithm licensing now looks less like capitulation and more like calibrated de-escalation, letting both capitals claim a win at home.\" NurPhoto via Getty ImagesThe White House referred the BBC to TikTok when contacted for comment.Oracle and Silver Lake declined to comment. The BBC has contacted MGX for comment.The deal drew critiques from Senate Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon, who said it wouldn't do \"a thing to protect the privacy of American user\".Under the terms, TikTok's recommendation algorithm is set to be retrained on American user data to ensure feeds are free from outside manipulation.\"It's unclear that it will even put TikTok's algorithm in safer hands,\" said Sen Wyden.He opposed the 2024 law, and was among the US lawmakers who lobbied to extend the TikTok deadline in January in a bid to give Congress more time to mitigate threats from China.Some users also expressed caution at the prospect of new investors.Small business owner Tiffany Cianci, who has more than 300,000 followers and nearly four million likes on the platform, said she hopes the incoming investors will maintain the same user experience for entrepreneurs like her.\"I hope small business owners are protected,\" Ms Cianci said.TikTok has said that more than seven million small businesses market their products and services on TikTok in the US.\"I reserve judgement on whether or not we have saved the app for those small business,\" she added.Ms Cianci said she chose TikTok for promotion because the platform offers profit-sharing on terms that are more favourable than what competitors like Meta offer.Over the last year, Ms Cianci has been active in organising protests in Washington and on TikTok aimed at saving the app.",

    "body": "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says his government will crack down on hate speech following Sunday's deadly shooting at Bondi Beach that targeted a Jewish festival.Fifteen people were killed when two gunmen opened fire at an event to mark the first day of Hanukkah.New laws will target \"those who spread hate, division and radicalisation\", Albanese told reporters in Canberra. The home affairs minister will also be given new powers to cancel or refuse visas for those who spread hate and a new taskforce will be set up to ensure the education system \"prevents, tackles and properly responds to antisemitism\".The new laws will also include penalties for preachers and leaders who promote violence, a new federal offence of \"aggravated hate speech\", and the introduction of \"hate\" as an aggravating factor in sentencing crimes for online threats and harassment.\"Every Jewish Australian has the right to feel safe, valued and respected for the contribution that they make to our great nation,\" Albanese said.\"The terrorists, inspired by ISIS... sought to turn Australians against each other. Australians have responded to that act of hatred with love and sympathy for those in mourning.\"Daniel Aghion, the President of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the peak body representing Australian Jews, said he would \"need to see the details before making an assessment as to whether the measures are likely to live up to their billing.\"\"We warned of the risk of not dealing with antisemitism in this country promptly and effectively after 7 October. It is an absolute tragedy that it has taken a massacre of Jewish and other Australians for that step to be taken.\"David Ossip, president of NSW Jewish Board of Deputies, welcomed the changes. \"For too long, Australian Jews have been targeted through social media, hate preachers and university campus activities. It was conveniently ignored until it was too late. The gaslighting and dismissal must end,\" he was quoted by the Sydney Morning Herald as saying.Tensions have been high in the country since the shooting, with police detaining seven men in southwest Sydney on Thursday after receiving a tip that a \"violent act was possibly being planned\", New South Wales Police said in a statement.Police said they did not identify \"any connection\" to their investigation into Sunday's attack in Bondi. Two cars were \"intercepted\" at George Street, police said. In videos shared by local media sites, armed officers appeared to detain people on the street just hours after Albanese made his speech.Antisemitism envoy Jillian Segal, who also spoke at the press conference, said the country was \"at a very important moment not only for our community, but for fighting antisemitism around the world.\" Albanese said his government would be \"fully supporting and adopting\" the  recommendations Segal put forward in July in a report.Her report was criticised by some upon its release in July due to its implications for free speech, including plans to monitor universities and arts organisations and withhold funding if they were deemed to have failed to act against antisemitism. There were concerns for instance, that the funding could be used to silence pro-Palestinian protests.The Jewish Council of Australia said it supported Albanese's commitment to act, including his focus on gun reform and online hate.But, it said it was \"concerned that elements of today's announcement resemble long-standing proposals from the pro-Israel lobby which have nothing to do with addressing violent extremism.\"\"If education initiatives like university scorecards become a form of ideological policing - particularly where they are used to limit legitimate criticism of Israel - they will only make Jews less safe, and do the opposite of combating antisemitism,\" Jewish Council of Australia executive officer Dr Max Kaiser said.Meanwhile, Albanese acknowledged accusations from the Jewish community that his government had not done enough to prevent antisemitism since the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas, and said more could have been done. \"I accept my responsibility for the part in that as prime minister of Australia,\" he said. \"But what I also do is accept my responsibility to lead the nation and unite the nation. Because what people are looking for at this time isn't more division.\"Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the government was \"shifting the threshold\" on hate speech.\"There have been individuals who have managed to exploit a nation that had different principles of freedom of speech and have gone right to the limits of language that is clearly dehumanising, unacceptable, having no place in Australia, but have not quite crossed the threshold to violence,\" he said.",

    "body": "13 hours agoIlma HasanBBC Hindi, West BengalRubaiyat Biswas/BBCSunali Khatun says the deportation tore her family apart\"I was scared that my child's nationality would change if he was born in Bangladesh,\" says a heavily pregnant Sunali Khatun, 25, who returned to India earlier this month after being deported to the neighbouring country in June.Ms Khatun, a domestic worker from India's eastern state of West Bengal, was detained in Delhi with her husband, Danish Sheikh, and their eight-year-old son, and deported to Bangladesh on suspicion of being illegal immigrants. Bangladeshi authorities later jailed the family for entering the country unlawfully.Her deportation made national headlines and was stridently criticised by the West Bengal government, who accused the Bharatiya Janata Party-led federal government of deporting her without cause. She is among hundreds of people who have been detained and deported to Bangladesh in the past couple of months on suspicion of being illegal immigrants.Delhi has not provided official data about these deportations, but top sources in the Bangladesh government had earlier told the BBC that in May alone, more than 1,200 people were \"illegally pushed in\". The same month, the government-run All India Radio reported that about 700 people had been sent back from Delhi.Crackdowns on alleged Bangladeshi immigrants are not new in India. The two countries share close cultural ties and a porous 4,096km (2,545-mile) border spanning five states. West Bengal, like others along the frontier, has long seen waves of migration as people sought work or fled religious persecution.But rights activists say the recent deportations target Muslims who speak Bengali - the language spoken in both West Bengal and Bangladesh - and the exercise is being conducted without due process.Rubaiyat Biswas/BBCMs Khatun and her son spent more than 100 days in a jail in BangladeshMs Khatun and her family, along with three neighbours - all Bengali-speaking Muslims - were deported after Delhi's Foreign Regional Registration Office said they lacked documents proving their legal entry or stay in India. Her seven-year-old daughter was left behind, as she was staying with relatives when the family was detained.Under protocol, authorities must verify a suspected illegal migrant's claim with the home state. West Bengal Migrant Workers Welfare Board chairman Samirul Islam told the BBC this was not done in Ms Khatun's case.The BBC has written to Delhi's home department that monitors deportations.In December, India's Supreme Court asked the federal government to allow Ms Khatun and her son to return on \"humanitarian grounds\" while her citizenship was investigated. She has since been living with her parents in West Bengal. Her husband, released on bail, remains in Bangladesh with a relative.Ms Khatun, says she has mixed feelings about being allowed back in India.She is relieved that her baby, due in January, will be an Indian citizen by birthright, but is anxious about her husband, whom she has not seen for more than three months since they were held in separate prison cells in Bangladesh.On video calls, she says, he breaks down often, saying that he wants to come home.\"We are not from Bangladesh, we are Indian. Why did they do this to us?\" Ms Khatun asks.Rubaiyat Biswas/BBCSunali's husband Danish remains in Bangladesh and speaks to her via video callsShe alleges that about a week after being detained by the Delhi police, her family and their neighbours were flown to the India-Bangladesh border and \"pushed\" across by paramilitary personnel from the Border Security Force (BSF).\"They left us in a dense forest [in Bangladesh] with lots of rivers and streams,\" she alleges and adds that when they tried to enter India by a route shown to them by locals, BSF guards beat up some in the group, including her husband, and then led them back into the forest they had initially been brought to.The BBC has sent questions to the BSF seeking a response to Ms Khatun's allegations.With help from locals, the group travelled to Dhaka, where they wandered for days with little food or water before being arrested and jailed. She says the prison food was inadequate for a pregnant woman and that her cell had no toilet.\"I was scared because it was just my son and me. All we did was cry,\" she says.The BBC has written to Bangladesh's home and prisons departments for a response to Sunali's allegations.Back in India, her family was making desperate trips to courts to prove her citizenship so that she could be brought back. Her case is being heard by the Supreme Court.\"My family has been torn apart,\" Ms Khatun says, as she sits in her parent's one-room shanty in West Bengal. With two young children and another one on the way, she says she doesn't know how she's going to feed all of them. But she is sure about one thing.\"We may not make enough money to eat three square meals if we live here, but I will never go back to Delhi,\" she says.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "An HR executive caught on the big screen at a Coldplay concert embracing her boss has described how \"the harassment has never ended\" following the viral moment.Kristin Cabot has spoken publicly for the first time about the video in which she was seen hugging Andy Byron, then-CEO of tech company Astronomer, at the show in July, before they abruptly ducked and hid from the camera.Ms Cabot, 53, who was the company's chief people officer, stepped down following Mr Byron's resignation after the firm announced he would be placed on leave and investigated.Speaking to the Times, Ms Cabot said she is looking for another job but has been told she is \"unemployable\".The video, which showed the pair swaying to music at the concert in Foxborough, Massachusetts, before trying to hide, quickly went viral after Coldplay's lead singer Chris Martin said to the crowd: \"Either they're having an affair, or they're just very shy.\"It was watched millions of times, shared widely across platforms, and they became the butt of many jokes. Within a few days, the internet had moved on, but for Ms Cabot, her ordeal had only just begun. \"I became a meme, I was the most maligned HR manager in HR history,\" Ms Cabot told The Times.Ms Cabot was separated from her husband, who was also at the concert.In a separate interview with the New York Times, she explained she was not in a sexual relationship with Mr Byron and the pair had never kissed before that night - although she admitted to having had a \"crush\" on her boss.\"I made a bad decision and had a couple of High Noons and danced and acted inappropriately with my boss,\" she said, adding she \"took accountability and I gave up my career for that\".As to why she chose to speak out now, Ms Cabot told the Times \"...it's not over for me, and it's not over for my kids. The harassment never ended\".Her two children are too embarrassed to be picked up from school by their mother, she said, or to go to sports games.\"They're mad at me. And they can be mad at me for the rest of their lives - I have to take that.\"Ms Cabot wondered whether Mr Byron had received the same level of abuse in the wake of the scandal, the Times reported.\"I think as a woman, as women always do, I took the bulk of the abuse. People would say things like I was a 'gold-digger' or I 'slept my way to the top', which just couldn't be further from reality,\" she said.\"I worked so hard to dispel that all my life and here I was being accused of it.\"At the peak of the scandal, her appearance, body, face and clothes were scrutinised and picked apart, with many high-profile celebrities including Whoopi Goldberg piling on. Gwyneth Paltrow, who was once married to Chris Martin, even took part in a tongue-in-cheek promotional video for Astronomer.Ms Cabot told the New York Times she received threatening messages after the incident, including from a person who said they knew where she shopped and wrote: \"I'm coming for you\".She said \"my kids were afraid that I was going to die and they were going to die\", and that her family began to dread public spaces and social events.Women were the cruellest critics, she told the New York Times, with all of the in-person bullying, plus most of the phone calls and messages coming from women.Her private details were put online (known as doxxing) and for weeks she was bombarded with up to 600 calls a day, the New York Times reported. The paparazzi outside her house was like a \"parade\" and there were 50 or 60 death threats, she said.Things are starting to improve, though. Ms Cabot has found therapists for her children and she has started leaving the house to play tennis.While she and Mr Byron kept in touch for a short while, exchanging \"crisis management advice\", Ms Cabot said they decided that \"speaking with each other was going to make it too hard for everyone to move on and heal,\" and have not spoken since.For his part, Mr Byron has not spoken publicly.A fake statement purporting to be from him, complete with Coldplay lyrics, went viral after the concert and Astronomer had to release its own to say that he had not made any comment.\"Astronomer is committed to the values and culture that have guided us since our founding,\" the statement read. \"Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability.\"The company later said: \"Andy Byron has tendered his resignation, and the Board of Directors has accepted.\"The BBC has tried to contact Andy Byron, via his former employer Astronomer, for comment.",

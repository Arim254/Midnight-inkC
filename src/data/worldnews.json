    "body": "13 hours agoImogen FoulkesGeneva CorrespondentThe United Nations committee on torture says there is evidence that Israel is operating a \"de facto state policy of organised and widespread torture\". The committee regularly reviews the records of all countries which have signed the convention against torture, taking testimony from their governments, and from human rights groups.During Israel's review both Israeli and Palestinian rights groups gave harrowing details about conditions in Israeli detention centres. It is alleged that thousands of Palestinians have been detained by Israel since the Hamas attacks of October 7th 2023. Under Israel's laws on administrative detention and on Unlawful Combatants – suspects who cannot be classed as prisoner of war - they can be held for long periods without access to a lawyer or family members. Many Palestinian families say they have waited months to even find out that a loved has been detained, amounting, the UN committee said, to \"enforced disappearance\".The committee was particularly critical of Israel's reported use of the Unlawful Combatants law to detain whole groups of Palestinians, including children, pregnant women, and the elderly.But it is the reported conditions in detention which make the grimmest reading in the committee's conclusions, published today. Palestinians, the evidence suggests, are regularly deprived of food and water, and subjected to severe beatings, attacks by dogs, electrocution, water boarding, and sexual violence. Some are allegedly permanently shackled, denied access to a toilet, and forced to wear diapers.The committee concluded that such treatment \"amounts to war crimes and crimes against humanity\". It said evidence of a \"de facto state policy of organised and widespread torture\" by Israel was one of the acts which constitute the crime of genocide under international law. Israel has repeatedly rejected accusations that it is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.One committee member, Peter Vedel Kessing of Denmark, said he and his colleagues were \"deeply appalled\" by what they heard. Committee members also said they were very concerned at the lack of investigations or prosecutions into allegations of torture. They called on Israel to launch independent investigations, and to ensure those responsible, including senior military officers, are held accountable.Israel, which has long accused the UN of bias against it, did not comment publicly today on the committee's findings, but during the committee hearings its ambassador, Daniel Meron, described the allegations of torture as \"disinformation\". He said that Israel was \"committed to upholding its obligations in line with our moral values and principles, even in the face of the challenges posed by a terrorist organisation\".In its conclusions, the UN committee took care to unequivocally condemn the Hamas attack of October 2023, and acknowledged the security challenges Israel faces. But it also warned that violations of international law by one side did not justify the other side doing the same. Under the convention, to which Israel is a party, the prohibition on torture is absolute: it is not allowed under any circumstances.Israel's domestic law is less clear however, suggesting that the convention only applies to Israeli territory, and not to the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank – an interpretation that many international lawyers dispute.The findings come amid increasing pressure on Israel over its human rights record. On Friday in Geneva, the UN Human Rights Office said the killing by Israeli soldiers of two Palestinians in the West Bank looked like a \"summary execution\". Video of the killing showed the two men with their hands up, apparently surrendering to Israeli forces.And UN aid agencies say conditions for people in the Gaza strip remain dire, despite the ceasefire. Thousands of families are facing the winter cold and rain in tents, they warn, not enough aid supplies are getting in, and Israeli air strikes against what Israel says are Hamas targets continue.",

    "body": "2 hours agoTheo Leggett,International business correspondentandYang Tian,BBC NewsThousands of Airbus planes have been grounded after it was discovered that intense solar radiation could interfere with onboard flight control computers, leading to delays around the world.Around 6,000 A320 planes are thought to be affected - half the European firm's global fleet - but it is understood most will be able to fly again after undergoing a quick software update.The UK's aviation regulator said there would be \"some disruption and cancellations to flights\" though the impact at airports appears to be limited.Airbus said it discovered the issue after an investigation into an incident in which a plane flying between the US and Mexico suddenly lost altitude in October.The JetBlue Airways flight made an emergency landing in Florida after at least 15 people were injured.Live updates on this storyAs well as the A320, the company's best-selling aircraft, the vulnerability also impacts the A318, A319 and the A321 models.It is understood that on around 5,100 Airbus planes, the issue can be addressed using a relatively simple software update which would typically take about three hours.However, the remaining 900 aircraft, which are older versions, will need to have onboard computers physically replaced, and will not be allowed to carry passengers again until the job has been completed. The length of time that takes will depend on the availability of replacement computers.Airbus said it acknowledged this would lead to \"operational disruption to passengers and customers\" and has apologised.Aviation analyst Sally Gethin told BBC News the situation is \"very much out of the ordinary\", saying the disruption to passengers would depend on the \"different approaches\" airlines take to upgrade their software.In the UK, disruption at airports has been limited so far. London's Gatwick Airport reported \"some disruption\", while Heathrow said it had not experienced any cancellations. Manchester Airport said it did not anticipate significant problems.The extent of the disruption varies between airlines: British Airways is understood not to be heavily impacted by the issue, while Wizz Air and Air India said they were already doing the updates.Publicly available data suggested Air France was impacted more than any other airline, with 50 of its flights to and from its Paris hub that were scheduled for Saturday morning cancelled, travel journalist Simon Calder told the BBC.Meanwhile Easyjet said it was \"expecting this to result in some disruption\" but later added it had started and \"already completed the software update on many aircraft\" and was planning a full service on Saturday.In the US, the software issue emerged on the same weekend as Thanksgiving - one of the busiest travel periods of the year.American Airlines said 340 of its planes were affected and that it expected \"some operational delays\", but added the vast majority of updates would be completed on Friday or Saturday. Delta Airlines said it believed the impact on its operations would be \"limited\".In Australia, budget airline Jetstar cancelled 90 flights after confirming around a third of its fleet was impacted, with disruption expected to continue all weekend despite the majority of aircraft having already undergone the update.Tim Johnson, policy director at the UK's Civil Aviation Authority, said the notice from Airbus \"unfortunately may mean there is some disruption, some delays or cancellations over the coming days\".He added that aviation was still \"one of the safest forms of transport\" due to the rigorous maintenance programs airlines have in place, and described the mass-grounding of flights as a \"a very rare event\".Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said \"the impact on UK airlines seems limited\", adding: \"It is heartening this issue has been identified and will be addressed so swiftly, demonstrating the high aviation safety standards globally.\"The problem identified with A320 aircrafts relates to a piece of computing software which calculates a plane's elevation. Airbus discovered that, at high altitudes, its data could be corrupted by intense radiation released periodically by the Sun. That led to the October incident in which an aircraft suddenly lost altitude - though the manufacturer said this was the only time an incident of its kind had occurred. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (Easa) has issued an emergency airworthiness directive, ordering the problem be addressed before each plane can carry passengers again.They will be allowed to make so-called \"ferry flights\", without passengers, in order to reach a maintenance facility.The A320 family are what is known as \"fly by wire\" planes. This means there is no direct mechanical link between the controls in the cockpit and the parts of the aircraft that actually govern flight, with the pilot's actions processed by a computer.",

    "body": "Scientists believe they have recorded electrical activity in the Martian atmosphere for the first time, suggesting the planet is capable of lightning.Nasa's Perseverance rover, which touched down on Mars in 2021, was sent to search for signs of biology and has spent the last four years exploring the Jezero Crater region.Electrical discharges nicknamed \"mini lightning\" were picked up from audio and electromagnetic recordings made by the rover's SuperCam instrument.Scientists hope new instruments for measuring atmospheric discharges and more-sensitive cameras could be sent to Mars to try to confirm the findings.A team of researchers from France analysed 28 hours of microphone recordings made by the Nasa rover over two Martian years (or 1,374 Earth days).They found that electrical discharges were normally associated with dust devils and dust storm fronts.Dust devils are small whirlwinds that form from hot air rising from the ground, and their internal movements can give rise to electrical discharges.Lead author of the research Dr Baptiste Chide told news agency Reuters: \"These discharges represent a major discovery, with direct implications for Martian atmospheric chemistry, climate, habitability and the future of robotic and human exploration.\"He and other scientists at the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in France believe that Mars now joins Earth, Saturn and Jupiter as planets known to have atmospheric electrical activity.Particle physicist Dr Daniel Pritchard wrote in scientific journal Nature that, although the recordings would \"provide persuasive evidence of dust-induced discharges\", because the discharges were only heard and not seen, \"some doubt will inevitably remain as to whether this really was Martian lightning\". He added: \"Given the history of this field, the debate is likely to continue for some time.\"In September this year, scientists found rocks with unusual markings on Mars. The intriguing markings, nicknamed leopard spots and poppy seeds, contain minerals produced by chemical reactions that could be associated with ancient microbes.It is possible the minerals were produced by natural geological processes, but Nasa said the features could be the clearest signs of life ever found.Today, Mars is a cold and arid desert. But billions of years ago there is evidence that it had a thick atmosphere and water, making it a promising place to look for past life.Perseverance was dispatched to the Jezero Crater because it showed qualities that may have meant it was once conducive to life, including signs it was once a delta when Mars could sustain liquid surface water.",

    "body": "Donald Trump has said that he will pardon the former president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted of drug trafficking charges in a US court last year. The US president said Hernández had been \"treated very harshly and unfairly\" in a social media post announcing the move on Friday.Hernández was found guilty in March 2024 of conspiring to import cocaine into the US, and of possessing machine guns. He was sentenced to 45 years in prison.Trump also threw his support behind conservative presidential candidate Nasry \"Tito\" Asfura in the Central American nation's general election, due to be held on Sunday.Hernández, a member of the National Party, who served as Honduras's president from 2014 to 2022, was extradited to the US in April 2022 to stand trial for running a violent drug trafficking conspiracy and helping to smuggle hundreds of tons of cocaine to the US. He was convicted by a New York jury two years later. Polls indicate the Honduran election remains a toss-up between three candidates including Asfura, the former mayor of Tegucigalpa and leader of the conservative National Party.Also in the running is Rixi Moncada, a former defence minister standing for the ruling left-wing Libre Party, and Salvador Nasralla, a television host with the centrist Liberal Party.Trump criticised Moncada and Nasralla on Friday, writing that the latter was \"a boderline Communist\" who was only running to split the vote between Moncada and Asfura.He characterised Asfura as \"standing up for democracy\" and praised him for campaigning against Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro, with whom Trump has engaged in a war of words in recent months.Nasralla has pledged to cut ties with Venezuela if he wins.The Trump administration has accused the left-wing Maduro - whose re-election last year was dismissed as illegitimate by many countries - of being the leader of a drugs cartel.It used countering drug trafficking as a justification for a military build-up in the Caribbean and has conducted strikes on vessels it says have been used for smuggling - though some analysts have described these moves as a means of pressuring Latin American leaders.Honduras has been governed since 2022 by President Xiomara Castro, who has forged close ties with Cuba and Venezuela.But Castro has maintained a co-operative relationship with the US, agreeing to preserve a long-running extradition treaty with it. Her country also hosts a US military base involved in targeting transnational organised crime in the region. More than 80 people have been killed in the US strikes on vessels suspected of being involved in the transport of narcotics since they began in August.US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth has said the aim of \"Operation Southern Spear\" was to eliminate \"narcoterrorists\". But legal experts have questioned the legality of the strikes, pointing out that the US has provided no evidence that the boats it has targeted were carrying drugs.",

    "body": "Hong Kong officials mark beginning of official mourning period with moment of silenceHong Kong officials have held a moment of silence at the start of a three-day mourning period to remember those killed after the city's deadliest fire in nearly 80 years. At least 128 people are now known to have died in the fire which engulfed several tower blocks on Wednesday. Hundreds remain unaccounted for.Eight people have been arrested on suspicion of corruption over the renovation works the blocks had been undergoing. Three others were detained earlier on manslaughter charges.The Saturday morning ceremony was held outside government headquarters, and saw city leader John Lee joined by other Hong Kong officials to observe three minutes of silence.The flags of China and Hong Kong were flown at half mast. The government has also set up memorial points across the city, where the public can pay their respects and sign condolence books.Once it started, the fire quickly spread to seven of the eight blocks of flats of Wang Fuk Court, with over 2,000 firefighters working to bring it under control across almost two days.The cause of the fire has still not been determined, though authorities have said that polystyrene and protective netting placed on the outside of the windows facilitated its spread.The tower blocks were also covered in bamboo scaffolding, which is commonly used in Hong Kong.Officials have confirmed that an investigation will be taking place over the next few weeks, with police already gathering evidence from the scene. Anger has spread throughout Hong Kong in the aftermath of the fire, with residents reporting broken fire alarms and negligence from the company carrying out the renovations on the Wang Fuk Court.The Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) said that those arrested in the corruption probe on Friday included directors at an engineering company and scaffolding subcontractors.Hong Kong's Labour and Welfare Secretary, Chris Sun, told reporters that his department had made 16 checks on the works taking place at Wang Fuk Court since July last year.Wang Fuk Court was built in 1983 and had provided 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census.",

    "body": "16 hours agoRaffi BergReutersIsrael's military has released footage showing an air strike hitting a buildingAt least 13 people have been killed in an Israeli raid on a village in southern Syria overnight, state media reported, in one of the deadliest incidents of its kind for months. It said children were among the dead.Sana news agency said residents of Beit Jinn \"confronted\" Israeli troops, leading to a firefight. Air strikes were also carried out. Syria's foreign ministry condemned what it called a \"war crime\" by Israel.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops went into the village, on the edge of the occupied Golan Heights, to detain militants who it said \"advanced terror attacks against Israeli civilians\".Six Israeli soldiers were injured in the clashes, three seriously, it said. The IDF said it targeted the Jamaa Islamiya militant group in Friday's operation. It said that when the raid began, \"several armed terrorists opened fire\" on its soldiers, who fired back. Sana said the village was also shelled. Footage released by the IDF shows two air strikes - one apparently on a group of people, and the other on a building. In bodycam footage also released by the IDF, soldiers can be seen firing on a street in the dark with the sound of automatic gunfire in the distance. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, said a building collapsed during the operation.The IDF later said \"all of the suspects were apprehended, and a number of terrorists were eliminated\".Sana said three people were arrested by the troops before they withdrew.ReutersIsrael said it targeted militants, although Syria said women and children were among the deadSana quoted the director of a local hospital as saying it had received bodies, including five from one family. The director said dozens of people had also been injured in the incident.The Syrian foreign ministry said more than 10 civilians had been killed, including women and children. It accused Israel of committing a \"fully-fledged war crime\", and called on the UN Security Council to do something to stop Israel's \"policy of aggression\". Israel regularly carries out incursions into Syrian villages, saying it acts to prevent the presence of armed groups.Since the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad nearly a year ago, Israel has moved its forces across a buffer zone on the Golan Heights into southern Syria, where a number of anti-Israel groups and cells operate.Israel says it will not allow the Syrian army, which it considers a threat, to deploy there.The buffer zone - a demilitarised stretch of land - had been a no-go area designed to keep the peace after a ceasefire ended the 1973 war between Israel and Syria. The UN has said the IDF's deployment there was a \"violation\" of the agreement which it said both sides should uphold.The US has for months been mediating talks between Israel and Syria for a security agreement in the area between the two sides, but without success.",

    "body": "Senegal's prime minister and Nigeria's former president have both said they believe the ousting of Guinea-Bissau's president this week was staged.Umaro Sissoco Embaló's apparent removal by the military on Wednesday came a day before authorities were due to announce election results. The military has since suspended the electoral process and blocked the release of the results, insisting it thwarted a plot to destabilise the politically unstable country.Senegal's PM Ousmane Sonko and Nigeria's ex-leader Goodluck Jonathan did not provide evidence to support their claim that the coup was fabricated. Embaló has previously faced accusations of using crises to quash dissent.Some local civil society groups have accused Embaló of masterminding a \"simulated coup\" against himself with the help of the military, saying it was a ruse to block election results from coming out in case he lost.Embaló has not responded to the allegations.The 53-year-old former president arrived in neighbouring Senegal on a chartered military flight late on Thursday following his release by the military forces who toppled his government.Nigeria's Jonathan, who led a team of election observers from the West African Elders Forum to Guinea-Bissau, said the incident \"was not a coup\".He described it as a \"ceremonial coup\", questioning the events that preceded it and why it was Embaló who first announced his own overthrow. The latter phoned French TV station France 24 and said: \"I have been deposed.\"Jonathan contrasted this with how other leaders in the region were ousted in recent coups.Meanwhile, Senegal's Sonko told lawmakers that \"what happened in Guinea-Bissau was a sham\".Both men have demanded the results of the presidential election be released.Their statements add to opposition claims in Guinea-Bissau that the coup was contrived, though no-one has so far presented evidence to support this.Embaló has said he has survived multiple coup attempts during his time in office - though critics have previously accused him of fabricating crises in order to crack down on dissent.He dissolved Guinea-Bissau's parliament after one attempted coup in December 2023 and the country has not had a sitting legislature since then.On Friday, Guinea-Bissau's transitional leader Gen Horta N'Tam appointed Ilidio Vieira Té, previously the finance minister, as the new prime minister.Additionally, the African Union suspended Guinea-Bissau's membership on Friday because of the unconstitutional military takeover, AFP reports. The West African bloc Ecowas took a similar action, while urging the military to return to the barracks.Guinea-Bissau is a coup-prone West African nation which is also strained by drug trafficking. The military said they were taking power to thwart a plot by unnamed politicians who had \"the support of a well-known drug baron\" to destabilise the country.A mother of three told the BBC that it was not the first military takeover she had lived through, but had nonetheless come as a surprise as people were expecting to hear about the outcome of the election, which had an estimated voter turnout of more than 65%.\"We heard gunfire. We ran away. We tried to pack our bags to go home,\" she said.Another resident of the capital, Bissau, said he was unhappy about the situation.\"This doesn't help anyone because it puts the country into chaos,\" Mohamed Sylla told the BBC.But reactions have been mixed, with some residents praising the army and hoping for an orderly transition.\"I am not against the military regime as long as they improve the living conditions in the country,\" Suncar Gassama told the BBC.",

    "body": "A Tunisian court has handed jail terms to dozens of opposition leaders, lawyers and businessmen accused of attempting to overthrow the nation's president.Forty people including opposition leader Jawahar Ben Mbarek were handed sentences ranging from four to 45 years over the alleged conspiracy to oust President Kais Saied.Twenty of those charged have fled abroad and were sentenced in absentia, while others have been held in detention since 2023.Human rights groups have criticised the trial as politically motivated, characterising the prosecutions as an escalation of Saied's crackdown on dissent since he suspended Tunisia's parliament in 2021 and began ruling by decree.Tunisian authorities argue the defendants, who include former head of intelligence Kamel Guizani, attemtpted to destabilise the country and topple Saied. Ben Mbarek and party leaders Issam Chebbi and Ghazi Chaouachi received jail terms of 20 years. All three have been detained since the 2023 crackdown.The maximum sentence, 45 years, was given to businessman Kamel Ltaif, while opposition politician Khyam Turki received a 35-year term.Ben Mbarek has been on hunger strike for over a month and was at risk of dying, news agency AFP reports, citing his sister and lawyer Dalila Ben Mbarek.Among those sentenced in absentia was politician and feminist Bochra Belhaj Hmida, as well as French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy, human rights groups say.The final sentences were issued by an appeals court after the opposition figures were initially sentenced in April. Saied had branded them \"terrorists\".A lawyer for the defendants was quoted by Reuters as describing the trial as a \"farce\" that had the \"clear intent to eliminate political opponents\".Human rights groups have also been critical of the prosecutions.Sara Hashash, deputy regional director at Amnesty International, described the sentences as \"unjust\" and \"an appalling indictment of the Tunisian justice system\".She said that while three defendants were acquitted by the appeals court, it had increased others' sentences.\"The Court of Appeal has thereby also rubber stamped the government's use of the justice system to eliminate political dissent.\"After the initial ruling in April, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said the trial had raised \"serious concerns about political motivations\", and urged the Tunisian government to \"refrain from using broad national security and counter terrorism legislation to silence dissent\".On Saturday, thousands of Tunisians marched through the capital, Tunis, in an anti-government protest, accusing Saied of cementing a one-man rule through the judiciary and police.Saied was elected in 2019 after Tunisia emerged from the Arab Spring democracy movement.But the north African nation has since seen democratic backsliding and the re-imposition of aspects of authoritarian rule.",

    "body": "Runaway nuns can stay in Alpine convent if they leave social media14 hours agoBethany BellIn ViennaBethany Bell/BBCSister Rita (L),  Sister Regina (C) and Sister Bernadette have gained a substantial following for their social media postsThree Austrian nuns in their 80s who ran away from the old people's home where they were placed have been told they can stay in their former convent \"until further notice\".However, Church authorities say they can only stay if they stop posting on social media.Sister Bernadette, 88, Sister Regina, 86, and Sister Rita, 82, are the last nuns at the Kloster Goldenstein convent in Elsbethen, near Salzburg.In a statement released in their name, they said they were willing to reach an agreement in principle but their legitimate claims and needs would have to be taken seriously.They indicated they were not entirely happy with the Church's offer, saying it had the \"character of a gagging contract\".The three nuns say they were taken out of the convent against their will in December 2023.In September, they moved back in with the help of former students and a locksmith, angering Church officials.The nuns' superior, Provost Markus Grasl from Reichersberg Abbey, called on them to return to the care home, saying their decision to return to the convent was \"completely incomprehensible\".The nuns' story sparked worldwide interest. Supporters helped them with food, electricity and social media, posting videos of the nuns' daily lives.These feature the nuns at prayer or at lunch, and include Sister Rita's exercise workouts. She was recently given a pair of boxing gloves.The Goldenstein nuns have amassed almost 100,000 followers on Instagram and several thousand on Facebook.Now after almost three months of standoff, a spokesman for the Provost, Harald Schiffl, has told Austrian Press Agency APA that the nuns can stay for now.It follows a meeting earlier this week, where a proposed solution to the standoff was suggested.The nuns could stay at the Kloster Goldenstein, Harald Schiffl told APA, but only under certain conditions. These include giving up their social media activities.Church officials also want the nuns to ensure that the enclosed part of the convent will no longer be accessible to people who do not belong to the order.In return, they will be allowed to stay and be provided with medical care and spiritual support from a priest.BBC/Bethany BellThe three nuns have lived in Schloss Goldenstein for decades\"Now it's up to the sisters,\" Harald Schiffl told APA.According to the statement released on Friday, the three sisters would have no future recourse to advice from lawyers and the requirement for them and their helpers to cease their social media activity had \"no legal basis and... would deprive the sisters of their only remaining protection from the interested public\".The three nuns have spent much of their lives at Schloss Goldenstein, a castle which has been a convent and a private girls' school since 1877. The school, which started accepting boys in 2017, is still functioning.Sister Bernadette attended the school herself, arriving as a teenager in 1948. One of her fellow students was Austrian actress Romy Schneider, one of the world's biggest film stars of the 1960s and 70s.Sister Regina arrived at the convent in 1958 and Sister Rita in 1962.All three nuns went on to work at the school as teachers for many years. Sister Regina was headmistress.But the numbers of nuns dwindled. In 2022, the building was taken over by the Archdiocese of Salzburg and the Reicherberg Abbey, an Augustinian monastery. Provost Markus Grasl from Reichersberg Abbey became the nuns' superior and the community was officially dissolved at the beginning of 2024.The remaining nuns were granted lifelong right of residence, as long as their health and mental capacity allowed.In December 2023, the decision was made to transfer them to a Catholic care home, where they felt unhappy.At the beginning of September, Sister Bernadette, Sister Rita and Sister Regina moved back, helped by a group of former students.The nuns told the BBC at the time that they were determined to stay.\"Before I die in that old people's home, I would rather go to a meadow and enter eternity that way,\" said Sister Bernadette.",

    "body": "12 hours agoJames FitzGeraldandMahfouz ZubaideAFP via Getty ImagesTens of thousands of Afghans entered the US under special immigration protections following the US withdrawal from the country in 2021Afghans living in the US have condemned Wednesday's \"deeply tragic\" deadly shooting attack in Washington DC, while stressing that the suspect - who moved to the US from Afghanistan four years ago - does not represent them.The alleged gunman, 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, entered America under a programme that offered special immigration protections to Afghans who worked with the US in the wake of the its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.National Guard member Sarah Beckstrom, 20, was killed in Wednesday's shooting, and a colleague, Andrew Wolfe, 24, is said to be fighting for his life.In response, US President Donald Trump has halted the processing of all immigration requests from Afghans, ordered a review of green cards issued to individuals from 19 countries, and threatened a wider crackdown on migrants from what he calls \"third-world countries\". On Friday, his administration also said it had halted all decisions on asylum claims. The Afghan Community Coalition of United States expressed its sympathy for families of the victims, calling for a \"comprehensive investigation\" but urging the US government not to delay or suspend Afghan immigration claims.\"Twenty years of Afghan-US partnership must not be forgotten,\" the coalition's statement said, nodding to the two-decade effort launched by the US in 2001 to overthrow Afghanistan's Taliban rulers and establish security in the country.Afghans living in America told the BBC they had been horrified by the Washington DC attack, which they emphasised was the act of just one person.Some spoke anonymously out of fear of reprisals by the Taliban, which took back control of Afghanistan following the US troop withdrawal in 2021.One of the Afghans, who made his move after the US withdrawal, described Wednesday's incident as \"deeply tragic\". He noted the timing ahead of Thanksgiving, and amid a \"highly charged political environment in Washington DC\".But he highlighted that the shooting was an \"individual criminal offence, not representative of a community\".\"Afghans in the United States are hardworking, tax paying members of society,\" he added. \"They remain grateful to America for the evacuation efforts during the crisis in Kabul.\"Thousands of Afghans scrambled to escape the country in 2021, many via Kabul, as the US withdrew its troops and the Taliban swept in. The suspect, Mr Lakanwal, is said by US officials to have had a relationship with US forces in Afghanistan while they were stationed there. He helped guard US forces at Kabul airport at the time of the withdrawal, a former military commander who served alongside him told the BBC.He came to the US the same year. He applied for asylum in 2024, and his application was granted earlier this year, an official told the BBC's partner CBS News.FBI: Suspect had relationship with 'partner forces' in AfghanistanAnother Afghan, who also moved to the US following the country's withdrawal from Afghanistan four years ago, labelled Wednesday's shooting \"really shocking\". He said he was praying for the families of the victims.He suspected that it was an \"individual crime which is committed without any support, participation and co-operation of others\", and said the attack \"should not be counted for the whole community\". Another Afghan man living in the US who spoke to the BBC said the shooting had been a \"very devastating event for all immigrants\", adding that the political reaction had left many people in a state of uncertainty.The situation felt more acute due to the threats in his country of origin, he said: \"For us Afghans there's problem for us in Afghanistan as well as here.\"Crystal Bayat, an Afghan human rights activist who moved to the US after 2021, said that despite having secured permanent residency, she still feared the US government could abruptly change course on accepting Afghan migrants.\"I have a fear every single day that what if the policy changes and they deport us from here?\" Ms Bayat told the Outside Source programme on BBC World Service.\"I hope President Trump changes his mind on this,\" Ms Bayat said. \"It is very dangerous to punish entire immigrant communities, or the people who stood shoulder to shoulder with the (American) people.\"She said there were families who were still in danger in Afghanistan due to their support of the US before the withdrawal.

    "body": "Zelensky's top adviser resigns after anti-corruption raid on his home14 hours agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor andJaroslav LukivReutersYermak has for years been Zelensky's closest aide and has played a key role in talks towards ending the warUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said his chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, has resigned following an anti-corruption raid on his home.Yermak, a towering figure with enormous political influence, has been Zelensky's closest adviser throughout Russia's full-scale war, but has come under increasing pressure over an escalating scandal - even though he is not accused of any wrongdoing.Zelensky had recently appointed him to head crucial negotiations, with US President Donald Trump leading a new drive to end the Russia-Ukraine war.In a stark address to the nation outside his presidential office, Zelensky called for unity, warning: \"We risk losing everything: ourselves, Ukraine, our future.\"The corruption scandal has rocked Ukraine for weeks, weakening Zelensky's own position and jeopardising the country's negotiating position with the US at a delicate time.Ukraine, backed by its European allies, has sought to change the terms of a US-led draft peace plan originally seen as heavily slanted towards Russia.Early on Friday Ukraine's two anti-corruption agencies raided Yermak's apartment in Kyiv's government quarters and the chief of staff said on social media that \"from my side there is full co-operation\".\"I'm grateful to Andriy that Ukraine's position on the negotiating track was always presented as required: it was always a patriotic position,\" Ukraine's president said during his video address in Kyiv.Zelensky said he would start consultations on Saturday on who would replace Yermak as his top adviser: \"When all the attention is focused on diplomacy and the defence in a war, inner strength is required.\"\"Russia wants Ukraine to make mistakes – there won't be any mistakes from our side. Our work continues, our fight continues. We have no right... to retreat, to quarrel [among ourselves].\"Yermak's departure from Ukraine's leading circle will come as a major blow for Zelensky, with US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll due to arrive in Kyiv by the end of this week as part of Trump's draft peace plan. US officials are heading to Moscow next week and Russia's Vladimir Putin said on Friday he backed a Hungarian offer to host a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest.Putin has continued to promote Russia's maximalist demands to bring an end to the war. He claimed on Thursday that Russian forces had the initiative on the battlefield and the fighting would only end when Ukrainian troops withdrew from the entire eastern Donbas region, including several strategically important cities under Ukrainian control.\"If they don't withdraw, we'll achieve this by force of arms,\" Putin said.Hours before the raid on his flat, Yermak continued to explain his government's position as it comes under US pressure to make territorial concessions to Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\"As long as Zelensky is president, no-one should count on us giving up territory. He will not sign away territory,\" Yermak told The Atlantic website.Yermak, 54, admitted during his interview he was under \"enormous\" pressure to stand down, adding \"the case is fairly loud, and there needs to be an objective and independent investigation without political influence\".AFP via Getty ImagesEarlier this week, Yermak took part in talks in Geneva with US Secretary of State Marco RubioUkraine's anti-corruption bureau Nabu and specialised anti-corruption prosecutor's office (Sap) did not explain why they searched his flat.In the past few weeks investigators have linked several high-profile figures to an alleged $100m (£75m) embezzlement scandal in the energy sector. They said they had uncovered an extensive scheme to take kickbacks and influence state-owned companies including state nuclear energy firm Enerhoatom.Russian officials involved in Trump's draft peace plan have talked up the corruption claims, which have alarmed European Union allies. Ukraine is a candidate to join the EU and a report earlier this month highlighted doubts over \"commitment to its anti-corruption agenda\".Earlier this year Zelensky sought to curb the powers of the two anti-corruption agencies, but he was forced to backtrack almost immediately after widespread protests and objections from Kyiv's Western allies.Zelensky has already fired Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk and Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko and several suspects have been detained in the burgeoning corruption scandal that has outraged public opinion because of allegations that money was diverted from key infrastructure projects vital for safeguarding Ukrainian power supplies.As winter starts in Ukraine, Russian attacks have already badly damaged its energy infrastructure and Ukrainians across the country have had to cope with only a few hours of electricity a day.One of the president's former business associates, Timur Mindich, has left the country in the wake of the corruption allegations.Mindich was co-owner of the TV studio Kvartal 95 where Zelensky's acting career took off before he was elected president.In recent weeks Andriy Yermak's popularity has nose-dived and MPs from all parties, including his own, have been calling for his sacking, initially for what they saw as his inflated power for an unelected official, but more recently, the burgeoning corruption scandal.Recent polling suggested 70% of the public wanted him to resign.Zelensky and his now-former chief of staff became friends about 14 years ago, while the future president was a senior media executive and Yermak worked for him as a lawyer. Yermak was made chief of staff a year after Zelensky was elected president in 2019.On the first night of Russia's invasion, they appeared together with colleagues delivering a defiant video message outside the presidential office on Kyiv's Bankova Street, vowing to stay and fight.\"We are all here,\" Zelensky told Ukrainians. \"Our soldiers are here, the citizens are here and we are all here. We are defending our independence, and that's how it will continue.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoNick Thorpe,Budapest correspondentandPatrick JacksonHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has met President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, days before Russia holds talks on a US push to end the war in Ukraine.Orban is seen as one of Putin's closest allies in Europe and he has consistently angered his Nato and EU allies by undermining solidarity against Russia.\"We are aware of your balanced position on the situation in Ukraine,\" Putin told Orban in remarks carried by Russian state TV.Posting later on social media, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said the Hungarians had got what they came to Moscow for: guaranteed supplies of Russian oil and gas, and agreement to continue the construction of the Paks nuclear power station.Reacting to news of Orban's visit, Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany, the EU's biggest member state, told reporters: \"He is acting without a European mandate and he is doing so without consulting us but that is nothing new.\"Referring to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Merz said of Orban: \"He has his own ideas about ending this war. So far, they have not been realised. If someone has a better idea than us, then that is very welcome. Unfortunately I just doubt that this time will be more successful than last time.\"Putin thanked the Hungarian prime minister for proposing Budapest as a potential venue for a Russia-US summit with President Donald Trump. \"Trump immediately said: ''We have good relations with Hungary, you have good relations with Viktor, and I do too, so I suggest this option.' Of course, we happily agreed,\" Putin said.According to Reuters news agency, Orban told Putin that Hungary was \"interested in peace\" and added: \"Our meetings today give me the  opportunity to confirm, Mr President, that Hungary is ready to provide a platform for such negotiations.\"However, the atmosphere when the delegations met in Moscow appeared surprisingly frosty and at one point Orban inadvertently bumped into his Russian host, after shaking hands with other members of the Russian delegation. One independent Hungarian media outlet also suggested that Putin's words had been mistranslated into Hungarian, to sound more positive.Plans for a Budapest \"peace summit\" were proposed last month but they were shelved, reportedly because the Russian side had refused to compromise on Putin's maximalist demands for an end to the war.The Hungarian leader's Fidesz party faces parliamentary elections in April and polls suggest that for the first time in 15 years it could be defeated at the ballot box. If he were to host a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest, it could help boost his chances of re-election.Orban, who last visited Moscow in July 2024, has repeatedly challenged EU attempts to end European imports of Russian oil and gas.He billed Friday's visit as the second leg of a strategy to ensure Russian energy supplies this winter, for Slovakia and Serbia as well as Hungary.Earlier this month in Washington, he secured exemption from US sanctions on Russian fuel - but only as long as he remains in power.Ever since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Orban has claimed to have been on the side of peace and told Hungarian state radio last week that \"Europe has decided to go to war in Ukraine\".He has strongly backed Trump's 28-point peace plan to end the war and during frantic diplomacy after it emerged, the Orban government and pro-Orban media have accused EU leaders of \"war-mongering\" for trying to adapt the plan to take account of Ukraine's objections.Joining Orban and Putin in the Kremlin were leading Russian officials, including Putin aide Yuri Ushakov, who is part of Russia's negotiating team with the US.In a letter this week to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the Hungarian leader called for immediate, unconditional peace talks, for the EU to launch direct negotiations with the Kremlin. He stressed his opposition to further EU funds for Ukraine, and rejected the use of frozen Russian assets to fund Ukrainian defence.Now, with little sign of Russian willingness for compromise on Ukraine, Orban is focusing on Russian energy. Deals he struck in Washington to buy US liquefied natural gas and start buying US nuclear fuel mean Hungary will buy less of both from Russia, potentially annoying his Russian hosts.Orban argues that without deals with the US and Russia, heating prices would triple next month.Hungary is under pressure from the EU to end all imports of Russian energy by 2027 and is likely to use any agreement in Moscow to continue to defy Brussels.Hungary currently receives over 80% of its oil and gas, and 100% of its nuclear fuel from Russia, and total Hungarian trade contributes approximately $5bn annually to the Russian budget.Like Trump, Putin has made clear he wants Orban to win next April's election, so another diplomatic \"triumph\" for Orban would serve the interests of both sides. At this year's Valdai Forum in Sochi on 29 September, Putin praised Orban personally, and saluted \"nationally oriented political forces\" gaining ground in Europe.\"If these forces in Europe continue to grow stronger, then Europe will be reborn,\" Putin said.",

    "body": "6 hours agoAna FaguyWashingtonWatch: How the shooting of two National Guard members unfoldedTwo members of the National Guard were shot and seriously wounded on Wednesday just blocks from the White House in Washington DC. One died on Thursday while the second remains in a critical condition, US President Donald Trump said the following day. The suspect, an Afghan national, is in custody. In response to the attack, Trump said he would deploy another 500 troops to the streets of the nation's capital. What happened in the shooting near the White House?Just after 14:00 EST (19:00 GMT) on Wednesday, two members of the National Guard, both from West Virginia, were shot at close range near Farragut Square in downtown Washington DC. The soldiers had been on a high-visibility patrol near the corner of 17th and I streets, an area where many office workers mill around at lunchtime. Metropolitan Police Assistant Chief Jeff Carroll said the suspect \"came around the corner\" and \"immediately started firing\", adding that the soldiers had been \"ambushed\".Muriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington DC, said the incident was a targeted attack. The location of the shooting, just blocks from the White House, meant a number of law enforcement officials were quickly on the scene to treat the two victims and apprehend the gunman. The guard members were taken to hospital, where one later died. Trump was at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida ahead of the US Thanksgiving holiday and not at the White House at the time.Patel: National Guard members 'brazenly attacked' and in critical conditionWhat do we know about the victims?The victims have been named as Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24 - both uniformed members of the West Virginia National Guard. Ms Beckstrom died on Thursday, Trump said while on a Thanksgiving call with US service members.He said Mr Wolfe remains in critical condition after being shot multiple times. ReutersAttorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News that Ms Beckstrom had volunteered to work in the nation's capital over the Thanksgiving holiday.\"She volunteered, as did many of those guardsmen and women, so other people could be home with their families,\" she said.What do we know about the suspect?The Department of Homeland Security named the suspect as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, and described him as \"a criminal alien from Afghanistan\".During his apprehension, the suspect was shot four times, law enforcement sources told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.ReutersMr Lakanwal is 29 years old and not co-operating with authorities, officials said.He is said to have come to the US in 2021. He lived with his wife and five children on the other side of the country, in the state of Washington.How did he come to the US?Mr Lakanwal reportedly came to the US in September 2021, under a programme for Afghans named Operation Allies Welcome that existed during the presidency of Joe Biden. This was during the time period that followed a chaotic withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan. As the Taliban took back control of the country, there were fears of retribution against those who had co-operated with the US.The Congressional Research Service has estimated that around 77,000 Afghans entered the US under special immigration protections, in place for about a year following the US withdrawal.Mr Lakanwal had a relationship in Afghanistan with the US forces, FBI Director Kash Patel said. CIA Director John Ratcliffe said he had worked with the intelligence agency.Mr Lakanwal applied for asylum in 2024, and his application was granted earlier this year, an official told CBS. What will he be charged with? The US attorney for Washington DC, Jeanine Pirro, said the initial charges of assault against the suspect will be upgraded to murder in the first degree.Initially, the administration had announced that Mr Lakanwal would be charged with three counts of assault with intent to kill while armed, along with possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. \"It is a premeditated murder. There was an ambush with a gun toward people who didn't know what was coming,\" Pirro told Fox and Friends on Friday. \"And that is the homicide, and that is the murder that we're looking at right now.\"Watch: Police chief describes how shooting of National Guard members unfoldedHow has the Trump administration responded?Just hours after the shooting, Trump posted a video speaking from Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida. He described the shooting as an \"act of terror\" and \"a crime against humanity\". Trump said he would deploy an additional 500 National Guardsmen to Washington DC - where there are currently nearly 2,200 troops.National Guard troops are a reservist force that can be activated to serve as military troops, but have limited power as they cannot enforce the law or make arrests.Trump deployed troops in August to tackle what he called \"out of control\" crime in the nation's capital.Overall crime in the nation's capital has fallen since the force was sent, which Trump credits to the troops' presence on the streets.The Trump administration has also highlighted the suspect's background, and announced a range of measures aimed at toughening the US approach to migration from Afghanistan and other nations.On Wednesday, the day of the shooting, it suspended processing all immigration requests from Afghans.The next day, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said it would re-examine green cards [permanent US residence cards] issued to individuals who migrated to the US from 19 countries.And Trump went on to say he would \"permanently pause migration\" to the US from all \"third-world countries\" - using a term that was used in the past to describe poorer, developing nations.On Friday in a post on X, USCIS director Joseph Edlow said the Trump administration would halt asylum decisions for all nationalities \"until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible\".",

    "body": "'This was preventable': Anger and unanswered questions after Hong Kong fire1 day agoKoh EweandKelly NgVideo shows how fast fire spread in Hong Kong high-riseShock is giving way to anger in Hong Kong after a massive fire ripped through a densely populated subsidised housing estate on Wednesday, killing at least 128 people and critically injuring dozens.Authorities say substandard mesh and plastic sheets on the buildings' windows may have spread the blaze, which raged for more than a day.Firefighting operations have now ended, with dozens of residents still unaccounted for.Questions are mounting as to how the fire at Wang Fuk Court spread so rapidly and who is responsible, with many calling it a \"man-made disaster\".Three people in charge of renovating the blocks are under arrest for manslaughter, and authorities have launched a corruption inquiry.A post that has gone viral on social media in the wake of the blaze reads: \"It's not an accident.\"Several residents have revealed in interviews that the fire alarm did not sound when the fire broke out. Authorities said on Friday that they had checked the fire alarms in all eight blocks and found that they were not working properly. Kiko Ma, who owns an apartment at Wang Fuk Court, says the alarms had been turned off amid renovation works, as construction workers regularly used fire escapes to get in and out of the building. Ms Ma lives in Canada with her family, but visits the Hong Kong apartment several times a year.\"This was preventable... A lot of people did not do their duties,\" the 33-year-old tells the BBC, claiming that the renovation firm used \"poor quality, flammable materials\".Residents often saw construction workers smoking and found cigarette butts along their window ledges, she adds.\"People kept asking what would happen if there was a fire. Everyone was very worried about this.\"Getty ImagesThe blaze spread rapidly and went on for more than a day in some blocksThis is Hong Kong's deadliest fire in at least 63 years - already having surpassed the toll of the August 1962 inferno in the Sham Shui Po neighbourhood, which killed 44 people and displaced hundreds.Built in the 1980s, Wang Fuk Court in Hong Kong's north-eastern Tai Po district comprises eight 31-storey buildings, seven of which went up in flames. The apartments here are sold at subsidised prices, but day-to-day affairs in the estate are managed by privately appointed firms.According to the 2021 census, the complex was home to about 4,600 people - nearly 40% of whom were 65 or older. The city's fire department on Thursday said firefighters faced major challenges trying to rescue residents, including high temperatures, the risk of further scaffolding collapse, and the small and crowded interiors of the apartments.Hong Kong is well-known for its tiny, densely packed inner-city dwellings, where many public rental housing tenants have, on average, a living space of just 14.1 square metres. It is unclear how many people were in Wang Fuk Court when the fire broke out, but the more recent census figures suggest it is home to around 4,600  residents. Hundreds of them have been evacuated to temporary shelters, and some are being allocated emergency housing units.Police are investigating whether mesh netting, plastic and canvas sheets used during renovations met fire safety standards. In a presser on Friday they attributed the rapid spread of the fire to styrofoam blocks placed outside the windows of the apartments, apparently to \"protect\" them from the debris and dust.Some experts also believe the bamboo scaffolding connecting the apartment blocks helped fuel the inferno. Such scaffolding is an iconic sight across Hong Kong, and widely used in construction.Earlier this year, authorities announced plans to phase out bamboo in favour of sturdier, fire-resistant steel, citing bamboo's combustibility and deterioration over time.Getty ImagesHundreds of residents have been evacuated to temporary shelters while emergency housing units are being allocated to someResidents at Wang Fuk Court had expressed unease about renovation plans when they were announced last year. Reports of those concerns have now resurfaced online, sparking accusations around a lack of transparency.Another homeowner who was abroad when the fire broke out said the plans were \"fundamentally shady\". \"[Those in charge] used small favours to encourage unsuspecting elderly residents to support their plans,\" they wrote in a comment on Instagram.Mr Lai, a sales associate who the BBC agreed to refer to by his last name only, says Wang Fuk Court residents had earlier questioned the high cost of renovation works. Calls from some residents to re-elect the estate's management committee went unheeded, he added. This week's fire is not an isolated incident, Mr Lai said, claiming that construction companies \"often prioritise cost efficiency\" over safety. He noted that a building in Hong Kong's Central district went up in flames last month after its bamboo scaffolding caught fire.\"When similar incidents happen, they raise the question of whether [there are] systemic weaknesses.\"Hong Kong authorities on Thursday ordered inspections of all housing estates undergoing \"major repairs\" to check for the \"safety of scaffolding and building materials\".",

    "body": "1 day agoGrace Tsoi,BBC World ServiceandBBC News Chinese,Hong KongBBCJimmy Lai, 78, faces life in prison for national security offencesOn a winter morning in 2022 Raphael Wong and Figo Chan walked into Hong Kong's Stanley prison to meet Jimmy Lai, the media billionaire who had been arrested two years before and was awaiting trial charged with national security offences.They had all been part of the turbulent protests that had rocked Hong Kong in 2019, when hundreds of thousands took to the streets demanding democracy and more freedom in the Chinese territory. They would also often meet for dinner, sometimes lavish meals, gossiping and bantering over dim sum, pizza or claypot rice.In prison, he \"loved eating rice with pickled ginger,\" Chan said. \"No-one could have imagined Jimmy Lai would eat something like that!\"But neither had they imagined a reunion at a maximum security prison, the protests crushed, friends and fellow activists jailed, Hong Kong just as boisterous and yet, changed. And gone was the owner of the irreverent nickname \"Fatty Lai\": he had lost considerable weight.Decades apart - Lai in his 70s, Wong and Chan about 40 years younger - they had still dreamed of a different Hong Kong. Lai was a key figure in the protests, wielding his most influential asset, the hugely popular newspaper, Apple Daily, in the hope of shaping Hong Kong into a liberal democracy. That proved risky under a contentious national security law imposed in 2020 by China's Communist Party rulers in Beijing.Lai always said he owed Hong Kong. Although he is a UK citizen, he refused to leave. \"I got everything I have because of this place,\" he told the BBC hours before he was arrested in 2020. \"This is my redemption,\" he said, choking up.He wanted the city to continue to have the freedom it had given him. That's what drove his politics - fiercely critical of the Communist Party and avowedly supportive of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. It cost him his own freedom.Watch: Jimmy Lai's last interview as a free man in 2020Lai harboured \"a rabid hatred\" of the Chinese Communist Party and \"an obsession to change the Party's values to those of the Western world\", the High Court ruled on Monday as it delivered the verdict in his trial. It said that Lai had hoped the party would be ousted - or, at the very least, that its leader Xi Jinping would be removed.Lai was found guilty on all counts of charges he had always denied. The most serious one - colluding with foreign forces - carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.\"Never,\" Lai had said to that charge when he testified, arguing that he had only advocated for what he believed were Hong Kong's values: \"rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly\".Monday's verdict was welcomed by Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee, who said Lai had used his newspaper to \"wantonly create social conflicts\" and \"glorify violence\". The law, he added, never allows anyone to harm the country \"under the guise of human rights, democracy and freedom\".Getty ImagesLai's wife Teresa and son Shun-yan at court for Lai's verdict, along with Cardinal Joseph Zen, former bishop of Hong Kong who baptised Lai in 1997 Back in 2022, before Wong and Chan left the prison, Lai asked them to pray with him, to Wong's surprise.Lai's Catholic faith had deepened in solitary confinement - an arrangement he had requested, according to authorities. He prayed six hours a day and he made drawings of Christ, which he sent in the mail to friends. \"Even though he was suffering,\" Wong said, \"he didn't complain nor was he afraid. He was at peace.\"Peace was not what Jimmy Lai had pursued for much of his life - not when he fled China as a 12-year-old, not while he worked his way up the gruelling factory chain, not even after he became a famous Hong Kong tycoon, and certainly not as his media empire took on Beijing.For Lai, Hong Kong was everything that China was not - deeply capitalist, a land of opportunity and limitless wealth, and free. In the city, which was still a British colony when he arrived in 1959, he found success - and then a voice.Apple Daily became one of the top-selling papers almost instantly after its debut in 1995. Modelled on USA Today, it revolutionised the aesthetics and layout of newspapers, and kicked off a cut-throat price war.From a guide to hiring prostitutes in the \"adult section\" to investigative reports, to columns by economists and novelists, it was a \"buffet\" targeting \"a full range of readers\", said Francis Lee, a journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Former editors and employees spoke of Lai's encouragement - \"If you dared to do it, he would dare to let you do it\" - and his temper. One said he often swore.They describe him as unconventional, and as a visionary who wasn't afraid to bet on experiments. \"Even before the iPhone was launched, he kept saying mobile phones would be the future,\" recalled one of the paper's editors, adding that he was full of ideas. \"It was as if he asked us to create a new website every day.\"It had been the same when he owned a clothing label. \"He was not afraid of disrupting the industry, and he was not afraid of making enemies,\" said Herbert Chow, a former marketing director at a rival brand.That was both his making and undoing, Chow said: \"Otherwise, there would have been no Apple Daily. Of course, he wouldn't have ended up like this either.\"An early TV commercial for Apple Daily featured the then 48-year-old Lai biting the forbidden fruit while dozens of arrows took aim at him.It became a self-fulfilling prophecy.Jimmylai.substack.comThe Apple Daily commercial when it launched in 1995Escape from ChinaIt was his first taste of chocolate that beckoned Lai to Hong Kong as a boy.After carrying a passenger's luggage at a railway station in China, Lai was given a tip, and a bar of chocolate. He took a bite. \"I asked him where he's from. He said Hong Kong. I said, 'Hong Kong must be heaven' because I had never tasted anything like that,\" Lai said of the encounter in a 2007 documentary, The Call of the Entrepreneur.Life in Mao Zedong's China was punctuated by waves of oppressive campaigns - to industrialise China overnight, to weed out capitalist \"class enemies\". The Lais, once a family of business people, were blacklisted. His father fled to Hong Kong, leaving them behind. His mother was sent to a labour camp.Decades later, Lai wrote of how of he and his sisters would be dragged out of their homes to watch a crowd forcing their mother to kneel while she was shoved and taunted - cruel public shaming that soon became the norm. The first time, Lai wrote, was terrifying: \"My tears flowed freely and wet my shirt. I dared not make a move. My body was burning with humiliation.\"Uncowed, his grandmother finished every story with the same message: \"You have to become a businessman even if you only sell seasoned peanuts!\"And so, at the age of 12, he set off for Hong Kong, among millions who fled the mainland - and Mao's devastating rule - over the years.The day he arrived, on the bottom of a fishing boat, along with about 80 seasick travellers, he was hired by a mitten factory. He described the long working hours as a \"very happy time, a time that I knew I had a future\". It was there that one of his co-workers helped him learn English. Years later, he would give interviews and even testify at court in fluent English.By his early 20s, he was managing a textile factory and after making money on the stock market, he started his own, Comitex Knitters. He was 27.Getty ImagesJimmy Lai at his home in Hong Kong in 1993 Business often took Lai to New York, and on one of those trips, he was lent a book that came to define his worldview: The Road to Serfdom by Nobel Prize-winning economist Friedrich Hayek, a champion of free-market capitalism. \"People's spontaneous reaction\" and \"the exchange of information\" have created the best in the world, was his takeaway. To him, that was Hong Kong's strength.The book spurred a voracious reading habit. He would read the same book multiple times, and read every book by authors he admired.  \"I want to turn the author's thoughts into my backyard garden. I want to buy a garden, not cut flowers,\" he said in a 2009 interview.After a decade in manufacturing, he was \"bored\" and founded the clothing chain Giordano in 1981, which became a fast-fashion pioneer. It was so successful that Tadashi Yanai sought advice from Lai when his Japanese label Uniqlo opened shops.Lai launched stores in China, which had begun to open up after Mao died. He was \"excited\", China \"was going to be changed, like a Western country\", he said in the 2007 documentary.Then in 1989, Beijing crushed pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square: a rude awakening for Lai and Hong Kong, which was set to return to Chinese rule in 1997 under a recent agreement by China and the UK.Giordano sold tees with photos of Tiananmen protest leaders and anti-Beijing slogans, and put up pro-democracy banners in stores across Hong Kong.A million people marched in Hong Kong in solidarity with student protesters in Beijing. Until 2020, Hong Kong held the largest vigil that mourned the massacre.Lai said later that he \"didn't feel anything about China\" until then. He had always wanted to forget that part of his life but \"all of a sudden, it was like my mother was calling in the darkness of the night\".Getty ImagesLai was a frequent attendee at Hong Kong 's annual vigils in memory of those who died at Tiananmen Square in 1989'Choice is freedom'The following year Lai launched a magazine called Next, and in 1994 published an open letter to Li Peng, \"the Butcher of Beijing\" who played a key role in the Tiananmen massacre. He called him \"the son of a turtle egg with zero intelligence\".Beijing was furious. Between 1994 and 1996, Giordano's flagship store in Beijing and 11 franchises in Shanghai closed. Lai sold his shares and stepped down as chairman.\"If I just go on making money, it doesn't mean anything to me. But if I go into the media business, then I deliver information, which is choice, and choice is freedom,\" Lai said in the 2007 documentary.He soon became a \"very active participant\" in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, meeting leaders to discuss strategy, said Lee Wing Tat, a former lawmaker from the Democratic Party.He became an outspoken critic of the CCP, writing in 1994: \"I entirely oppose the Communist Party because I hate everything that restrains personal liberties.\" He also started to voice concerns about the looming handover of Hong Kong, from Britain to China, in 1997. \"After more than a century of colonial rule, Hong Kongers feel proud to return to the embrace of the motherland,\" he wrote. \"But should we love the motherland even if it doesn't have freedom?\"During the handover, however, China's then-leader Jiang Zemin promised that Hongkongers would govern Hong Kong and the city would have a high degree of autonomy for the next 50 years.Getty ImagesLai at an \"Occupy Central\" protest in Admiralty in October 2014The 2014 Umbrella Movement sparked by Beijing's refusal to allow completely free elections in Hong Kong became another turning point for Lai.Protesters occupied the city's main commercial districts for 79 days. Lai turned up from 9am to 5pm every day, undeterred after a man threw animal entrails at him. \"When the police started firing tear gas, I was with Fatty,\" the former lawmaker Lee recalled.The movement ended when the court ordered protest sites to be cleared, but the government did not budge. Five years later, in 2019, Hong Kong erupted again, this time because of a controversial plan that would have allowed extradition to mainland China.What began as peaceful marches became increasingly violent, turning the city into a battleground for six months. Black-clad protesters threw bricks and Molotov cocktails, stormed parliament and started fires; riot police fired tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons and live rounds.Lai was at the forefront of the protests and served 20 months for participating in four unauthorised assemblies. A protester told the BBC he was surprised to see Lai: \"To me, he's a busy businessman, but he showed up.\"Getty ImagesLai at a pro-democracy march in 2019 Apple Daily provided blanket coverage or, as critics would argue, a sounding board for an anti-government movement.Government adviser Ronny Tong said Lai was \"instrumental\" in the protests because Apple Daily carried a \"totally false\" slogan – anti-extradition to China – which \"caught the imagination of people who wanted to cause havoc in Hong Kong\".Whether Apple Daily played a seditious role, and how much control Lai exerted over its stance was at the centre of his 156-day national security trial.Lai instructed the editorial team to \"urge people to take to the streets\", according to Cheung Kim-hung, former chief executive of Apple Daily's parent company Next Digital, and a defendant-turned-prosecution witness. After the National Security Law took effect, the newspaper was raided twice and eventually shut down in 2021.During the height of the protests, Lai flew to the US where he met then Vice-President Mike Pence to discuss the situation in Hong Kong. A month before the National Security Law was imposed, Lai launched a controversial campaign, despite internal pushback, urging Apple Daily readers to send letters to then US President Donald Trump to \"save Hong Kong\".All of this, the court ruled, amounted to a public appeal for a foreign government to interfere in Hong Kong's internal affairs.\"Nobody in their right mind should think that Hong Kong can undergo any kind of political reform without at least tacit acceptance from Beijing,\" Tong said. The protests in 2014 and 2019 \"are totally against common sense\".Getty ImagesCopies of the last Apple Daily newspaper early on June 24, 2021Beijing says Hong Kong has now moved from \"chaos to governance\" and onto \"greater prosperity\" because of the national security law and a \"patriot-only\" parliament. But critics, including hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers who have since left, say dissent has been stifled, and the city's freedoms severely curbed.Lee, the lawmaker, is among them: \"When I first came to the UK, I had nightmares. I felt very guilty. Why could we live in other places freely, while our good friends were jailed?\"Lai's family has been calling for his release for years, citing concerns for his health because he is diabetic, but their calls have been rejected so far. The government and Lai's Hong Kong legal team have said that his medical needs are being met.Carmen Tsang, Lai's daughter-in-law who lives in Hong Kong with her family, says her children miss grandpa - and the big family dinners he hosted every two weeks. His loud voice scared her daughter when she was younger, but \"they loved going to grandpa's place… They think he's a funny guy\".She is not sure today's Hong Kong has a place for Lai. \"If there's a speck of dust in your eye, you just get rid of it, right?\"Watch: What does the Jimmy Lai verdict mean for democracy in Hong Kong?",

    "body": "19 hours agoYolande KnellMiddle East correspondent, JerusalemBBCItzik Gvili demands the return of his son Ran, the last dead hostage in Gaza, in Tel Aviv's Hostages SquareIn central Tel Aviv, the main stage has now been dismantled in Hostages Square, the focal point for the campaign over the past two years to bring back Israelis held in Gaza.Nearby, signs and posters have been taken down, and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum has vacated the offices that served as its nerve centre. Of the 251 hostages seized by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in the 7 October 2023 attacks, 168 have been brought back alive from Gaza, eight have been rescued. Only one deceased hostage, Ran Gvili, remains.With songs and prayers instead of mass rallies, the Gvili family and a small crowd of supporters assemble in Hostages Square each Friday to mark the start of the Jewish Sabbath; this week, a candle for the Hanukkah holiday was also lit. They are determined to bring back the young police officer who was killed by Hamas fighters after he rushed to help people being attacked in Kibbutz Alumim in southern Israel in October 2023.\"I feel every day is still the 7 October. We didn't pass the 7 October, but we are strong, and we're waiting for him. We do whatever we need,\" says Itzik Gvili, Ran's father. \"This gives us hope: the support of the people.\"ReutersThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum's slogan is: \"Bring them home now\"From the start, people power has been key to the hostage families. As its operations wind down, members of the Hostages Families Forum have been reflecting on its extraordinary evolution which turned the grassroots group into a powerful international lobbying force.In the terrible aftermath of the 2023 Hamas-led assault on southern Israel, which also killed some 1,200 people, a huge group of distraught relatives gathered for the first time in Tel Aviv desperately seeking answers about their missing loved ones. Because of the incoming rocket fire from Gaza, they met in an underground car park.\"We were together, shocked, and it fell on me that this is actually real, that now we are going to face this unbelievable challenge of understanding where all these people are, getting them home,\" recalls Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat had been snatched from Kibbutz Be'eri.\"And the second thing is that we're going to do this together. I'm not going to stand alone.\"ReutersGil Dickmann (2nd R) said the public support gave him hope after kidnapping of his cousin, Carmel GatThe formation of the new forum, with its slogan: \"Bring them home now\", gave the hostages' families a much-needed sense of regaining control.\"It was very, very powerful to feel that when the government and Israeli state, in a way collapsed in those very first few days after 7 October, it felt like nothing was working, what was working was Israeli society,\" Mr Dickmann says. \"So many wonderful people came to help. That brought me a lot of hope.\"Dividing its efforts between supporting the families - many of whom were bereaved and displaced from their homes following the attacks - and campaigning in Israel and around the world, the Hostages Families Forum worked with more than 10,000 volunteers. They included former Israeli diplomats, lawyers and security officials.Funded entirely by donations, it began to pay some staff, and a high-tech company loaned its central Tel Aviv office space.ReutersA makeshift tunnel symbolizing Hamas's tunnel network in Gaza was constructed at Hostages Square In November 2023 - more than six weeks into the brutal war in Gaza, which had by then killed more than 14,000 Palestinians according to the Hamas-run health ministry - Israel and Hamas agreed to a Qatar-mediated truce.This saw most women and children hostages returned in exchange for Israel releasing more than 240 Palestinian prisoners, all women and children. Hamas also freed some foreign nationals.But after a week, the fighting resumed with ferocity. About half of the hostages were left in Gaza. In December, three Israeli hostages were killed by Israeli soldiers in Gaza despite the fact they were shirtless, waving a makeshift white flag, and calling out in Hebrew.Israeli Prime Minister's Office/handout via ReutersItay Regev and his sister Maya were released during the November 2023 ceasefireThose were difficult days for the Hostages Families Forum and in early 2024, with polls suggesting more Israelis prioritised eliminating Hamas over the return of those still held captive, it brought in political strategist, Lior Chorev, as campaign manager.\"We were in deep war in Gaza, deep war in Lebanon, there was the Iranian threat, and it appeared that everything was stuck, and public opinion was against us,\" Mr Chorev explains.\"As a civil society organisation, we could not impact whether or not there's going to be a deal, but we could work hard on the Israeli public opinion to ensure that if a deal came into place, it would have a sound civilian majority within the country.\"ReutersGaza has been devastated by the two-year war sparked by 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attacks on IsraelAs well as Saturday evening demonstrations in the plaza in front of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, now renamed Hostages Square, there were near-daily actions by the Hostages Families Forum ranging from concerts and art installations to civil disruption. Media and diplomatic teams helped keep the hostages at the centre of attention.\"They kept going 24/7 for two years,\" comments Times of Israel political correspondent Tal Schneider who, like visiting foreign officials, often went to the forum's HQ. \"This place became like a foreign ministry for the country, for the families of 250 people.\"Looking back, Michael Levy says his intensive campaigning helped him deal with the \"emotional rollercoaster\" after his sister-in-law, Einav, was killed at the Nova Festival and his younger brother, Or, was taken hostage alive.\"The only thing that helped me was becoming active. I was interviewed all the time. I went with 15 different delegations to over 12 countries. I spoke to whoever was willing to listen and didn't want to stop and think,\" Mr Levy says.\"You need to stay optimistic all the time. You need to tell yourself every morning that today is going to be the day that he's going to be released, even though you know you are lying to yourself.\"ReutersMichael Levy's brother, Or, was released during the ceasefire that lasted from January to March 2025Although a hostage-prisoner exchange deal to end the war laid out in mid-2024 was described by then-US President Joe Biden as an Israeli proposal, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was widely seen as dragging out hostilities to aid his own political survival – a claim he rejected.Tensions rose between the Hostages Families Forum and Israel's government; there was open animosity from some government supporters.The situation worsened after a Netanyahu aide was accused of deliberately acquiring and illegally leaking a top-secret document to a German newspaper to influence how Israel's public viewed negotiations on a ceasefire and hostage deal. The document was misleadingly cast as suggesting that pressure on the prime minister played into the hands of Hamas.ReutersHundreds of people were killed or taken hostage at the Nova music festival during the 7 October 2023 attacksFor Mr Dickmann and Mr Levy, there was a low point when they headed to Washington for Netanyahu's address to a joint meeting of US Congress in July 2024 with other forum members.They showed off T-shirts saying \"Seal the deal\" during an ovation for the Israeli leader and were arrested for an unlawful demonstration. \"That was one of the moments in which I felt most alone,\" Mr Dickmann says. \"It was one of the most frightening things and it was while Carmel was still alive in captivity.\"The worst news came a month later when Carmel and five other hostages were killed by their Hamas captors, as the Israeli military closed in nearby.Mr Dickmann says it was only an \"unbelievable support group\" of younger forum members that helped him get through the ordeal.After the Israeli deaths were confirmed, angry protesters flooded the streets of Israeli cities. The forum puts the total number at 600,000.In Tel Aviv, a crowd of hostage families and their supporters marched with six prop coffins. A crowd gathered outside Israel's military headquarters and clashed with police on a major road.EPAThe killing of Carmel Gat and five other hostages by their Hamas captors sparked a huge protest in Tel AvivBy the start of 2025, international opposition to the devastating Gaza war had reached new heights as the number of Palestinians killed approached 48,000, according to Gaza's health ministry.In Israel, polls indicated a clear shift in Israeli public opinion, with a growing majority backing a hostage deal to end the war. With the election of a new US president, the Hostages Families Forum was increasingly directing its efforts stateside.\"They needed to bypass their own government,\" comments Ms Schneider.  \"The most important person for the job was obviously [US] President [Donald] Trump. There were signs written in English carried by the people and they would pack all their messages into a one-minute video, and they'd send it to him.\"Working with regional mediators, the US secured a new Gaza deal between Israel and Hamas in January 2025, just as Trump took office. The first stage brought back 33 hostages – eight of whom were dead – in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Five Thai hostages were also released.But in mid-March, Israel ended the ceasefire, resuming its heavy bombing of Gaza, without starting talks on the deal's second stage, which involved a full end to fighting and the return of the remaining hostages.The White HouseReleased hostages travelled to Washington to ask President Donald Trump to ensure the return of those left behind in GazaFrail and emaciated following his release in February under the ceasefire deal, Or Levy was emotionally reunited with his three-year-old son, his parents and brother Michael. However, Michael's joy was short-lived. He quickly resumed his campaigning with others in the Hostages Families Forum.\"I got what I wanted, I got my brother back, but I couldn't just stop,\" he says, \"I couldn't be happy because in those 491 days, they became my family. I almost felt I knew all the other hostages, that every hostage still there was part of my family.\"Newly freed hostages gave TV interviews saying they had been starved and beaten in captivity, sometimes in response to the ill-treatment of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Despite their trauma and fragile health, a few of the former hostages travelled to the White House urging President Trump to use his influence to bring back all the living and dead Israelis they had left behind in Gaza.ReutersEvyatar David was among the last 20 living hostages freed shortly after the current ceasefire began in OctoberThere were more dramatic moments.In September, an Israeli air strike unsuccessfully targeted the exiled Hamas leadership as it met in Qatar, a regional mediator, to discuss a new ceasefire proposal presented by the US.However, the ultimate effect was to push the Trump administration - backed up by its Arab allies – towards a new plan to end the war, which had by then killed more than 67,000 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry.Israel and Hamas agreed a ceasefire deal, under which all 20 living and 28 dead hostages still in Gaza would be handed over in return for almost 2,000 Palestinian detainees and prisoners in Israeli jails, as well as a surge in humanitarian aid and a partial Israeli withdrawal.ReutersIsrael released about 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees from Gaza in exchange for the living hostagesWhen Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, arrived in Israel just after the latest ceasefire started on 10 October, they were greeted by rapturous applause on stage in Hostages Square.On 13 October, the remaining living hostages came back.\"I'll never have a happier day in my life,\" says Mr Dickmann, remembering seeing his best friends reunited with their loved ones.Mr Chorev, the Hostage Families Forum's chief strategist, considers that long-held Jewish and Israeli traditions won through.\"This basic value of the Israeli theme that you don't leave anyone behind, that you're responsible for each and every Israeli held by the enemy, this was something that was unclear to certain elements in the Israeli government,\" he says. \"But it was very clear to the Israeli public.\"Tali (L) has been helping out hostages' families since the beginning of the warSlowly, 27 of the dead hostages' bodies have been returned to Israel over the past two months.Amid the ruins of Gaza, where health ministry officials say the number of Palestinians killed has risen to more than 70,000, Hamas operatives and the Red Cross have been searching for Ran Gvili's body east of Gaza City.Now, the last funds of the Hostages Families Forum are being used to support the Gvilis and a few dozen volunteers continue to head to Hostages Square on Fridays.\"We have been here in the rain and in nearly 50-degree [Celsius] heat, from winter to summer,\" says Tali, from Tel Aviv. \"Now that this is nearly over, I have mixed emotions. There is still one hostage who hasn't come back. I told myself I would stay until the last one.\"A symbolic tunnel, a large \"Hope\" sign and a piano put in the square in honour of now released hostage, Alon Ohel - a musician - have not yet been removed, nor has the giant countdown board which marks the days since 7 October 2023. A final mass rally is promised for when Ran Gvili's body is returned for burial.Itzik and Talik Gvili are determined to bring their son Ran home for a proper burial Israel's prime minister has never appeared in Hostages Square, but he has met with released hostages and hostage families, including those from a small, alternative group to the Hostages Families Forum, the Tikva Forum. The Gvilis belong to both.The family joined a candle-lighting ceremony on the first night of Hanukkah with Netanyahu.\"We will bring Ran back, just as we brought back 254 out of our 255 abductees,\" the prime minister said - counting two living and two deceased hostages held in Gaza before 2023.  \"Some did not believe. I believe. My friends in the government believed. They said: 'It will be a miracle.' I said: 'This nation performs miracles.'\"But in Israel, painful questions linger over why more hostages' lives were not saved.The Hostages Families Forum recently released harrowing Hamas videos recovered in Gaza which show the six hostages who were later murdered, including Carmel Gat, celebrating Hanukkah in a tunnel in 2023.The hostage crisis continues to cast a long shadow over Israeli society; even as many take heart from the families' message of endurance and solidarity.Additional reporting by Davide Ghiglione and Gidi Kleiman",

    "body": "Watch: Moment German engineer becomes world's first wheelchair user to go into spaceAn engineer from Germany has become the world's first wheelchair user to go into space. Michaela Benthaus, who suffered a spinal cord injury in a mountain bike accident seven years ago, had reached out to a retired space engineer online to see if her dream of being an astronaut was still possible. He then helped organise the historic 10-minute flight with Blue Origin, the space tourism company founded by Jeff Bezos. Ms Benthaus and five others blasted off from Texas on Saturday and reached a point just above the so-called \"boundary\" of space, known as the Kármán line.\"It was the coolest experience!\" she said after landing in a video shared by Blue Origin.\"I didn't only like the view and the micro-gravity, but I also liked going up. That was so cool, every stage of going up.\"New Shepard, Blue Origin's reusable sub-orbital launch vehicle, took off from the company's Texas launch pad at 14:15 GMT.Ms Benthaus, who works at the European Space Agency, said she had \"really, really figured out how inaccessible our world still is\" for people with disabilities following her accident.She made her own way from her wheelchair into the capsule, using a bench extending from the hatch. Hans Koenigsmann, the retired SpaceX manager who helped organise the trip, was strapped in nearby to offer assistance during the flight if needed.\"I met Hans the first time online,\" Ms Benthaus said. \"I just asked him, like, you know, you worked for so long for SpaceX, do you think that people like me can be astronauts?\" Koenigsmann said Ms Benthaus \"basically inspired me to do this. \"It's her drive that kind of convinced me I should do that, too, and to just experience something that I've seen from the outside for a long time,\" he said.Blue Origin said ground support equipment was added to help Ms Benthaus enter and exit the capsule. \"Michi's flight is particularly meaningful, demonstrating that space is for everyone, and we are proud to help her achieve this dream,\" Phil Joyce, senior vice-president of New Shepard, said. The cost of the mission, which is the 16th suborbital space tourism launch carried out by Blue Origin, has not been revealed. The company has taken dozens of tourists to space. In April, pop star Katy Perry, Bezos's fiancée Lauren Sánchez and CBS presenter Gayle King were among six women blasted into space aboard a Blue Origin rocket for a flight that lasted about 11 minutes.The high-profile flights come at a time when private space companies are fiercely competing for dominance in space tourism.

    "body": "The US Coast Guard is in \"active pursuit\" of another vessel in international waters near Venezuela as tensions in the region continue to escalate.US authorities have already seized two oil tankers this month - one of them on Saturday. Sunday's pursuit related to a \"sanctioned dark fleet vessel that is part of Venezuela's illegal sanctions evasion\", a US official said. \"It is flying a false flag and under a judicial seizure order.\"Washington has accused Venezuela of using oil money to fund drug-related crime, while Venezuela has described the tanker seizures as \"theft and kidnapping\".US President Donald Trump last week ordered a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving the country.Venezuela - home to the world largest proven oil reserves - has accused the Trump administration of trying to steal its resources. US authorities have not yet officially confirmed Sunday's pursuit, and the exact location and name of the tanker involved is not yet known. As of last week, more than 30 of the 80 ships in Venezuelan waters or approaching the country were under US sanctions, according to data compiled by TankerTrackers.com.Saturday's seizure saw a Panamanian-flagged tanker boarded by a specialised tactical team in international waters. That ship is not on the US Treasury's list of sanctioned vessels, but the US has said it was carrying \"sanctioned PDVSA oil\". In the past five years the ship also sailed under the flags of Greece and Liberia, according to records seen by BBC Verify.\"These acts will not go unpunished,\" the Venezuelan government said in response to Saturday's incident. It added that it intended to file a complaint with the United Nations Security Council and \"other multilateral agencies and the governments of the world\".Venezuela is highly dependent on revenues from its oil exports to finance its government spending.In recent weeks, the US has built up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea and has carried out deadly strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug-smuggling boats, killing around 100 people.Sanctions also were placed on some of President Maduro's relatives and on businesses associated with what the US calls his illegitimate regime.Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Friday: \"It is clear that the current status quo with the Venezuelan regime is intolerable for the United States.\"He added that the goal of the Trump administration is to change that dynamic.  His comments were criticised by Venezuela's foreign minister who accused Rubio dragging the US down the path of \"regime changes\". It has provided no public evidence that these vessels were carrying drugs, and the military has come under increasing scrutiny from Congress over the strikes.The Trump administration has accused Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro of leading a designated-terrorist organisation called Cartel de los Soles, which he denies.",

    "body": "17 hours agoCarrie Davies,BBC Pakistan correspondentandAnna LamcheFormer Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi have been sentenced to further jail terms following a fraud case involving state gifts.They were convicted of breaking Pakistan's rules on gifts after Bibi was given a luxury jewellery set by Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman during a 2021 state visit.The pair are already serving time in prison for earlier convictions, and the new sentences - 10 years for criminal breach of trust and seven years for criminal misconduct, and a fine - will reportedly run concurrently to their earlier terms.Khan has described the charges as politically motivated and his lawyer told BBC News his team plan to challenge the verdict.Speaking to the BBC after the hearing, the former prime minister's lawyer, Salman Safdar, said Khan's legal team had only been informed about the sentencing late on Friday night, after normal court hours.They planned to mount a challenge to the verdict in the high court, Mr Safdar said.This case is the latest in a series of charges laid against the cricket star-turned-politician, who has been detained since August 2023. In January, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison over a separate corruption case.He has faced charges in more than 100 cases, ranging from leaking state secrets to selling state gifts. The BBC has been unable to confirm the exact number brought against him.The jewellery case, referred to as Toshakhana 2 in Pakistan, concerns a Bulgari jewellery set given to Bushra Bibi by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during a state visit in 2021, according to court documents. Under Pakistan's rules on state gifts, these items go to Pakistan's Toshakana department (state treasury), but politicians are able to purchase the items back.Khan is alleged to have asked a private firm to undervalue the jewellery set, before purchasing it back at a significantly reduced price.In addition to their jail terms, the pair were handed a fine of over 16 million Pakistani rupees (£42,600).Khan was also convicted in an earlier, different Toshakhana case - but he challenged that conviction, meaning his sentence is suspended until the outcome of his appeal. He also has other cases outstanding against him.These include terrorism charges relating to violent protests that took place on 9 May 2023, when he was previously arrested.Khan was Pakistan's prime minister until April 2022 when he was ousted in a vote of no confidence.Although he has not been seen in public, his social media accounts have continued to operate with messages attributed to him on X often appearing after jail visits.These have been highly critical of Pakistan's current government and its politically powerful army Chief Field Marshall Asim Munir, including posts calling him a tyrannical dictator.In November, he was denied any visitors for nearly a month.After campaigning by his family and party, his sister was allowed to visit in early December; a few hours after she saw him, his account posted a comment credited to Khan calling the Field Marshall Asim Munir a \"mentally unstable person\". Khan, 73, has not been allowed any family visits since.The judgement states the judge was lenient in sentencing because of Khan's \"old age\". Update: This story was updated to clarify the latest legal status of Khan's earlier, separate Toshakhana case.",

    "body": "In rebel-held Myanmar, civilians face devastating air strikes and a sham election3 hours agoYogita LimayeSouth Asia and Afghanistan correspondent in MyanmarBBCIang Za Kim had to flee her home after the junta launched air strikes nearbyLate one night last month Iang Za Kim heard explosions in a neighbouring village, then fighter jets flying overhead. She ran out of her home to see smoke rising from a distance.\"We were terrified. We thought the junta's planes would bomb us too. So we grabbed what we could – some food and clothes and ran into the jungles surrounding our village.\"Iang's face quivers as she recounts the story of what happened on 26 November in K-Haimual, her village in Myanmar's western Chin State, and then she breaks down.She's among thousands of civilians who've fled their homes in recent weeks after the Burmese military launched a fierce campaign of air strikes, and a ground offensive in rebel-held areas across the country, to recapture territory ahead of elections starting on 28 December.Four other women sitting around her on straw mats also start crying. The trauma of what they've gone through to make it to safety is clearly visible.While the air strikes were the immediate cause for Iang to flee, she also doesn't want to be forced to participate in the election.\"If we are caught and refuse to vote, they will put us in jail and torture us. We've run away so that we don't have to vote,\" she says.Many civilians have crossed into India to escape the violence in MyanmarSome from Chin state have described the junta's latest offensive as the fiercest it has launched in more than three years.Many of the displaced have sought refuge in other parts of the state. Iang is among a group that crossed the border into India's Mizoram state. Currently sheltered in a rundown badminton court in Vaphai village, the group's few belongings they were able to carry are packed in plastic sacks.Indian villagers have given them food and basic supplies.Ral Uk Thang has had to flee his home at the age of 80, living in makeshift shelters in jungles for days, before finally making it to safety.\"We're afraid of our own government. They are extremely cruel. Their military has come into our and other villages in the past, they've arrested people, tortured them, and burned down homes,\" he says.It isn't easy to speak to Burmese civilians freely. Myanmar's military government does not allow free access in the country for foreign journalists. It took over the country in a coup in February 2021, shortly after the last election, and has since been widely condemned for running a repressive regime that has indiscriminately targeted civilians as it looks to crush the armed uprising against it across Myanmar.During its latest offensive, the junta last week targeted a hospital in Rakhine State, just south of Chin State. Rebel groups in Rakhine say at least 30 people were killed and more than 70 injured.The Chin Human Rights Organisation says that since mid-September at least three schools and six churches in Chin State have been targeted by junta airstrikes, killing 12 people including six children.The BBC has independently verified the bombing of a school in Vanha village on 13 October. Two students –Johan Phun Lian Cung, who was seven, and Zing Cer Mawi, 12 - were killed as they were attending lessons. The bombs ripped through their classrooms injuring more than a dozen other students.Myanmar's military government did not respond to the BBC's questions about the allegations.This is the second time Bawi Nei Lian and his young family – a wife and two young children - have been displaced. Back in 2021, soon after the coup, their home in Falam town was burnt down in an air strike. They rebuilt their lives in K-Haimual village. Now they're homeless again.\"I can't find the words to explain how painful and hard it is and what a difficult decision it was to make to leave. But we had to do it to stay alive,\" he says.\"I want the world to know that what the military is claiming – that this election is free and fair – this is absolutely false. When the main political party is not being allowed to contest the election, how can there be genuine democracy?\"Bawi Nei Lian (left) says the scheduled elections are a shamThe National League for Democracy party, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, which won landslides in the two elections prior to the coup, will not be contesting as most of its senior leaders including  Suu Kyi are in jail.\"We don't want the election. Because the military does not know how to govern our country. They only work for the benefit of their high-ranking leaders. When Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's party was in power, we experienced a bit of democracy. But now all we do is cry and shed tears,\" says Ral Uk Thang.Iang Za Kim believes the election will be rigged. \"If we voted for a party not allied with the military, I believe they will steal our votes and claim we voted for them.\"The election will take place in phases, with a result expected around the end of January. Rebel groups have called it a sham.At the base of the Chin National Front in Myanmar, the most prominent rebel group operating in the state, the group's Vice Chairman Sui Khar says: \"This election is only being held to prolong military dictatorship. It's not about the people's choice. And in Chin State, they hardly control much area, so how can they hold an election?\"He points out the areas where the most intense fighting is ongoing on a map and tells us nearly 50 rebel fighters have been injured in just the past month. There have been deaths too, but so far the groups have not released a number.\"There are columns of hundreds of soldiers trying to advance into the northern part of Chin state from four directions,\" Sui Khar says. \"The soldiers are being supported by air strikes, artillery fire and by drone units.\"Abel lost his right left and his hands were severely wounded fighting against the juntaAccess to the base is extremely rare. Set amid thickly forested mountains, it is the heart of the resistance against the junta in Chin state.Sui Khar takes us to the hospital at the base. We see a group of injured fighters who were brought in overnight and had to undergo hours of surgery. Some of them have had to undergo amputations.Many of them were just schoolboys when the coup occurred in 2021. Just about adults now, they've let go of their dreams to fight on the frontline against the junta.Abel, 18, is in too much pain to speak. He was with a group of fighters trying to take back territory the junta captured a week ago. They won the battle, but Abel lost his right leg and has serious injuries to his hands as well.In a bed next to him is Si Si Maung, 19, who's also had a leg amputated.\"As the enemy was retreating we ran forward and I stepped on a landmine. We were injured in the explosion. Then we were attacked from the air. The airstrikes make things very difficult for us,\" he says. \"I've lost a leg, but even if I've to give up my life I'm happy to make the sacrifice so that future generations have a better life.\"The impact of the ferocity of the latest offensive is visible in room after room at the hospital.Yet, it's the support and grit of tens of thousands of youngsters like Si Si Maung, who picked up arms to fight against the junta, that have helped the rebels make rapid advances against a much more powerful rival in the past four-and-a-half years.Some like 80-year-old Ral Uk Thang hope that after the election, the junta will retreat, and he will be able to go back home.\"But I don't think I will live to see democracy restored in Myanmar,\" he says. \"I hope my children and grandchildren can witness it some day.\"Additional reporting by Aamir Peerzada, Sanjay Ganguly and Aakriti Thapar",

    "body": "11 hours agoShaimaa Khalil,JerusalemandMallory MoenchIsrael's security cabinet has approved the recognition of 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank as the government continues its settlement expansion push.Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a settler who proposed the move alongside Defence Minister Israel Katz, said the decision was about blocking the establishment of a Palestinian state. Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are considered illegal under international law. Saudi Arabia condemned the move. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said Israel's \"relentless\" settlement expansion fuels tensions, restricts Palestinian access to land, and threatens the viability of a sovereign Palestinian state. Violence in the occupied West Bank has surged since the war in Gaza began in October 2023, further heightening fears that settlement expansion could entrench Israel's occupation and undermine a two-state solution.The two-state solution refers to the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital, broadly along the lines that existed prior to the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.Since taking office in 2022, the current Israeli government has significantly increased the approval of new settlements and begun the legalisation process for unauthorised outposts, recognising them as \"neighbourhoods\" of existing settlements.The most recent decision brings the total number of settlements approved over the past three years to 69, according to Smotrich.The approvals come just days after the United Nations said settlement expansion had reached its highest level since 2017. The latest approvals include the re-establishment of two settlements — Ganim and Kadim — which were dismantled nearly 20 years ago.In May, Israel approved 22 new settlements in the occupied West Bank - the biggest expansion in decades.The Israeli government also approved plans in August to build more than 3,000 homes in the so-called E1 project between Jerusalem and the Maale Adumim settlement, which had been frozen for decades amid fierce opposition internationally.Smotrich at the time said the plan would \"bury the idea of a Palestinian state\".About 700,000 settlers live in approximately 160 settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, according to Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now. It is land Palestinians seek for a future independent state.Settlement expansion has angered Arab nations who have consistently said it undermines prospects for a two-state solution. It has also raised concerns about the possible annexing of the occupied West Bank.US President Donald Trump had warned Israel about such a move, telling TIME magazine that Israel would lose all its support from the US if it happened.In September, the UK - along with other countries including Australia and Canada - recognised a Palestinian state, a significant although symbolic change in government policy.Israel opposed the move, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying a Palestinian state \"will not happen\".",

    "body": "2 days agoSteve RosenbergBBC Russia Editor, MoscowReporters ask world leaders questions all the time.No big deal. Right?But what's it like putting a question to Vladimir Putin - the president who ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the leader whose country was accused this week by the head of MI6 of \"the export of chaos\"?And imagine asking that question live on TV while millions of Russians are watching.It's a big responsibility. You don't want to mess up.\"My question is about Russia's future. What kind of future are you planning for your country and your people?\" I ask President Putin.\"Will the future be like the present, with any public objection to the official line punishable by law?  Will the hunt for enemies at home and abroad be accelerated? Will mobile internet outages become even more common? Will there be new 'special military operations'?\"While I'm speaking, Vladimir Putin is making notes. And then replies.He defends Russia's repressive foreign agent law. Hundreds of Russians who are critical of the authorities have been designated \"foreign agents\".\"We didn't invent it,\" Putin tells me. \"This [foreign agent] law was adopted in a string of Western countries, including in America in the 1930s. And all these laws, including the US one, are much tougher…\"In reality, the Russian law is draconian. It excludes \"foreign agents\" from many aspects of public life, including teaching, the civil service, elections and public events. It imposes financial and property restrictions. Criminal prosecution can follow a single administrative fine.However, I'm unable to point this out to President Putin. The microphone was taken away from me after I'd finished my question.Suddenly the moderator intervenes to change the subject.\"There's another question here: 'What's going to happen to the BBC? It's facing a multi-billion lawsuit from the US president?',\" says anchor Pavel Zarubin.\"I think President Trump is right,\" President Putin confirms.The Kremlin and the White House seeing eye to eye… on the BBC.Putin returns to my question.\"Will there be new special military operations? There won't be, if you treat us with respect, and respect our interests, just as we've always tried to do with you. Unless you cheat us, like you did with Nato's eastward expansion.\"Visible for all to see is what is driving Vladimir Putin - a deep-seated resentment of the West. He argues that, for years, Western leaders have disrespected, deceived and lied to Russia - and that they're lying still by claiming that Moscow intends to attack Europe. \"What kind of rubbish is that?\" declares the Kremlin leader.But many European leaders simply don't trust Moscow. In the run-up to the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian officials denied they had plans for a mass attack.More recently Russia has been accused of violating European air space with fighter jets and drones, as well as of carrying out cyber-attacks and acts of sabotage.But as he finished answering my question, was this an olive branch to Europe from Russia's president?\"We're ready to cease hostilities immediately provided that Russia's medium- and long-term security is ensured, and we are ready to co-operate with you.\"However, if Moscow continues to connect its long-term security to its maximalist demands over Ukraine, European leaders will remain sceptical.",

    "body": "2 days agoJaroslav LukivUS President Donald Trump: \"We hit every site flawlessly\"The US says its military has carried out a \"massive strike\" against the Islamic State group (IS) in Syria, in response to a deadly attack on American forces in the country.The US Central Command (Centcom) said fighter jets, attack helicopters and artillery \"struck more than 70 targets at multiple locations across central Syria\". Aircraft from Jordan were also involved.It said the operation \"employed more than 100 precision munitions\" targeting known IS infrastructure and weapons sites.President Donald Trump said \"we are striking very strongly\" against IS strongholds, following the 13 December IS ambush in the city of Palmyra in which two US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter were killed.In a statement on X, Centcom – which directs American military operations in the Middle East, north-east Africa, central and southern Asia – said Operation Hawkeye Strike was launched at 16:00 Eastern Time (21:00 GMT) on Friday.Centcom commander Admiral Brad Cooper said that the US \"will continue to relentlessly pursue terrorists who seek to harm Americans and our partners across the region\".Rami Abdel Rahman, the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), told news agency AFP that \"at least five members of the Islamic State group were killed\" in eastern Syria's Deir ez Zor province, including the leader of a cell responsible for drones in the area.Petra, Jordan's state-run news agency, announced the Royal Jordanian Air Force had participated in the strikes to \"prevent extremist groups\" from \"threaten[ing] the security of Syria's neighbours and the wider region\".IS has not publicly commented. The BBC was unable to immediately verify the targets.US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the operation \"is not the beginning of a war - it is a declaration of vengeance. \"If you target Americans - anywhere in the world - you will spend the rest of your brief, anxious life knowing the United States will hunt you, find you, and ruthlessly kill you.\"Today, we hunted and we killed our enemies. Lots of them. And we will continue,\" the US defence secretary added.US Air Force/ReutersThe US Army identified the two soldiers killed in the attack as Sgt Edgar Brian Torres Tovar, 25, and Sgt William Nathaniel Howard, 29Posting on Truth Social, President Trump said the US \"is inflicting very serious retaliation, just as I promised, on the murderous terrorists responsible\".He said the Syrian government was \"fully in support\".Centcom earlier said that the deadly attack in Palmyra was carried out by an IS gunman, who was \"engaged and killed\".Another three US soldiers were injured in the ambush, with a Pentagon official saying that it happened \"in an area where the Syrian president does not have control.\"At the same time, the SOHR said the attacker was a member of the Syrian security forces.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, and the identity of the gunman has not been released.US Air Force/ReutersA US Air Force photo handout shows a KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft taking offIn 2019, a US-backed alliance of Syrian fighters announced IS had lost the last pocket of territory in Syria it controlled, but since then the jihadist group has carried out some attacks.The United Nations says the group still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.US troops have maintained a presence in Syria since 2015 to help train other forces as part of a campaign against IS.Syria has recently joined an international coalition to combat IS and has pledged to co-operate with the US.In November, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa - a former jihadist leader whose coalition forces toppled Bashar al-Assad's regime in 2024 - met Trump at the White House, describing his visit as part of a \"new era\" for the two countries.",

    "body": "10 hours agoJaroslav LukivandMayeni Jones,JohannesburgA manhunt is under way after a shooting at a tavern in South Africa left nine people dead and another 10 injured. Police said seven men and two women were killed in Bekkersdal, near Johannesburg, after about 12 unidentified gunmen arrived in two vehicles and opened fire at patrons. The shooting happened at about 01:00 local time on Sunday (23:00 GMT Saturday) and the perpetrators \"continued to shoot randomly as [people] fled the scene\", police added. South Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world. Sixty-three people were killed every day on average between April and September this year, according to police figures. Murders are often the result of arguments, robberies and gang violence. The motive for this attack is not clear.At the scene, deputy provincial police commissioner Maj-Gen Fred Kekana told  broadcaster Newzroom Afrika that the perpetrators, armed with pistols and one AK-47, were \"unprovoked\".\"The poor patrons were just enjoying themselves when people came and shot,\" he said. Two of the victims were shot outside the tavern as they tried to flee and a third was a taxi driver who had dropped off a passenger nearby, Maj-Gen Kekana added.Resident Nokuthula Bhukwana went to the tavern after she heard the shooting. \"When we arrived at the scene, we opened the doors and indeed scores of people were lying on the floor,\" she told the Reuters news agency.\"We rushed around and others were calling the police, and we also called the ambulance and they arrived. We had to carry some of the injured people using wheelbarrows to the clinic.\"Speaking to Newzroom Afrika, one resident described how gunfire had become a normal thing at night in Bekkersdal.\"Criminals, they do as they please here,\" the unnamed man said. \"These guns, they sound each and every evening... as soon as it's dusk we know that gunshots are about to sound and they will sound severely.\"It is terrorising our communities.\"Interviewed at the scene, deputy mayor for the local municipality Nontombi Molatlhegi said that locals were afraid of speaking out and identifying those responsible.She said that the police were under-resourced, and too thinly spread, and called for the military to get involved in protecting residents.\"We are crying, as well as the city political leadership, for the intervention of the national government to release [the army] so that they can be able to come in this space\" and be visible.There are about three million legally held firearms in South Africa, but there are at least the same number of unlicensed weapons in circulation in the country, which has a population of 63 million, according to statistics cited by Gideon Joubert from the South African Gunowners' Association.Earlier this month, at least 11 people - including a child - were shot dead at a hostel near Pretoria.There has been a significant increase in mass shootings - where four or more people are either killed or injured - since 2020, Claire Taylor, a researcher at campaign group Gun Free South Africa, told the BBC.Looking at media reports from 2024 her organisation recorded 80 such incidents, which was up from 71 the previous year. There has, however, been a decline in reported mass shootings in 2025.Among the most common locations are licensed taverns, such as in Bekkersdal this weekend, or illegal drinking spots, known locally as shebeens, which was the case in the 6 December killings.Additional reporting by Damian Zane",

    "body": "13 hours agoCaroline HawleyDiplomatic correspondentESOHREgyptian fisherman Issam al-Shazly was executed on Tuesday after being convicted of drug-related chargesSaudi Arabia has surpassed its record for the number of executions carried out annually for a second year in a row.At least 347 people have now been put to death this year, up from a total of 345 in 2024, according to the UK-based campaign group Reprieve, which tracks executions in Saudi Arabia and has clients on death row.It said this was the \"bloodiest year of executions in the kingdom since monitoring began\".The latest prisoners to be executed were two Pakistani nationals convicted of drug-related offences.Others put to death this year include a journalist and two young men who were children at the time of their alleged protest-related crimes. Five were women. But, according to Reprieve, most - around two thirds - were convicted of non-lethal drug-related offences, which the UN says is \"incompatible with international norms and standards\". More than half of them were foreign nationals who appear to have been put to death as part of a \"war on drugs\" in the kingdom.The Saudi authorities have not responded to the BBC's request for comment on the rise in executions.\"Saudi Arabia is operating with complete impunity now,\" said Jeed Basyouni, Reprieve's head of death penalty for the Middle East and North Africa. \"It's almost making a mockery of the human rights system.\"She described torture and forced confessions as \"endemic\" within the Saudi criminal justice system.Ms Basyouni called it a \"brutal and arbitrary crackdown\" in which innocent people and those on the margins of society have been caught up.On Tuesday, a young Egyptian fisherman, Issam al-Shazly, was executed. He was arrested in 2021 in Saudi territorial waters and said he had been coerced into smuggling drugs.Reprieve says 96 of the executions were solely linked to hashish.\"It almost seems that it doesn't matter to them who they execute, as long as they send a message to society that there's a zero-tolerance policy on whatever issue they're talking about - whether it's protests, freedom of expression, or drugs,\" said Ms Basyouni.There has been a surge of drug-related executions since the Saudi authorities ended an unofficial moratorium in late 2022 - a step described as \"deeply regrettable\" by the UN human rights office.Speaking anonymously to the BBC, relatives of men on death row on drugs charges have spoken of the \"terror\" they're now living in.One told the BBC: \"The only time of the week that I sleep is on Friday and Saturday because there are no executions on those days.\"Cellmates witness people they have shared prison life with for years being dragged kicking and screaming to their death, according to Reprieve.ReutersPrince Mohammed bin Salman has loosened social restrictions while simultaneously silencing criticismThe de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman - who became crown prince in 2017 - has changed the country profoundly over the past few years, loosening social restrictions while simultaneously silencing criticism.In a bid to diversify its economy away from oil, he has opened Saudi Arabia up to the outside world, taken the religious police off the streets, and allowed women to drive.But the kingdom's human rights record remains \"abysmal\", according to the US-based campaign group Human Rights Watch, with the high level of executions a major concern. In recent years, only China and Iran have put more people to death, according to human rights activists.\"There's been no cost for Mohammed bin Salman and his authorities for going ahead with these executions,\" said Joey Shea, who researches Saudi Arabia for Human Rights Watch. \"The entertainment events, the sporting events, all of it is continuing to happen with no repercussions, really.\"According to Reprieve, the families of those executed are usually not informed in advance, or given the body, or informed where they have been buried.The Saudi authorities do not reveal the method of execution, although it is believed to be either beheading or firing squad.In a statement sent to the BBC, the UN's special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Dr Morris Tidball-Binz, called for an immediate moratorium on executions in Saudi Arabia with a view to abolition,.He also pressed for \"full compliance with international safeguards (including effective legal assistance and consular access for foreign nationals), prompt notification of families, the return of remains without delay and the publication of comprehensive execution data to enable independent scrutiny\".Amnesty InternationalAbdullah al-Derazi and Jalal al-Labbad were executed in October and August respectively after being convicted of crimes they allegedly committed as minorsAmong the Saudi nationals executed this year were Abdullah al-Derazi and Jalal al-Labbad, who were both minors at the time of their arrest.They had protested against the government's treatment of the Shia Muslim minority in 2011 and 2012, and participated in the funerals of people killed by security forces. They were convicted of terrorism-related charges and sentenced to death after what Amnesty International said were grossly unfair trials that relied on torture-tainted \"confessions\". UN human rights experts had called for their release.The UN also condemned the execution in June of journalist Turki al-Jasser, who had been arrested in 2018 and sentenced to death on charges of terrorism and high treason based on writings he was accused of authoring.\"Capital punishment against journalists is a chilling attack on freedom of expression and press freedom,\" Unesco's Director-General, Audrey Azoulay, said.Reporters Without Borders said he was the first journalist to be executed in Saudi Arabia since Mohammed bin Salman came to power, although another journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, was murdered by Saudi agents at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018.Human Rights WatchJournalist Turki al-Jasser was executed in June after seven years in detentionLast December, UN experts wrote to the Saudi authorities to express concern over a group of 32 Egyptians and one Jordanian national sentenced to death on drugs charges, and their \"alleged absence of legal representation\". Since then, most of the group have been executed.A relative of one man put to death earlier this year said he had told her that people were being \"taken like goats\" to be killed.The BBC has approached the Saudi authorities for a response to the allegations but has not received one.But in a letter dated January 2025 - in reply to concerns raised by UN special rapporteurs - they said Saudi Arabia \"protects and upholds\" human rights and that its laws \"prohibit and punish torture\".\"The death penalty is imposed only for the most serious crimes and in extremely limited circumstances,\" the letter stated. \"It is not handed down or carried out until judicial proceedings in courts of all levels have been completed.\"",

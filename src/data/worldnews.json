    "body": "8 hours agoWill GrantCuba correspondent in HavanaBBCA sizeable exhibit in the Museum of the Revolution in Havana is dedicated to conditions in Cuba before the revolution took power in 1959. Inside the ornate former presidential palace, photographs and oral testimony detail the grinding poverty and ingrained corruption of the dictatorship of Cuba's then-military strongman, Fulgencio Batista.The enduring image is of a woman in a dirt-floored palm-leaf hut cooking with firewood. Similar pictures appear in state museums across the island from the Bay of Pigs to Birán, the birthplace of the father of the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro. The inference is clear: the revolutionaries saved Cubans from the ignorance and hardship of life under a Washington-backed de facto leader and led them to dignity, education and true independence.Yet today, Lisandra Botey identifies more with the impoverished woman in the photograph than with the revolutionaries who liberated her country from Batista.\"We're living like that now, we're exactly like that\", says housewife Lisandra outside her home in Havana, which is cobbled together with pieces of sheet metal and wood.\"Every morning, we have to go down to the beach [in Havana] and look for firewood. Then we bring it home to cook breakfast with – because if we get power, it comes on during school hours.\"Lisandra says she identifies with the impoverished woman in the photograph from pre-revolution CubaLisandra's nine-year-old daughter set off for school that morning with nothing in her stomach, she explains, tears pricking her eyes. Her husband, Brenei Hernández – a construction worker with next to no work – says they often have no idea where the next meal is coming from.\"Every day is the same hunger, the same misery\", he says, stirring a pot of white rice – so at the very least his daughter will come home from school to something hot to eat.With the Cuban economy in freefall since the coronavirus pandemic, no gas has been delivered to Brenei's flimsy home in a Havana suburb for months. He and his neighbours were already cooking with firewood and charcoal before US troops forcibly removed Cuba's closest ally, the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, from power on 3 January. Since then, though, Washington has seemingly taken full control of Venezuela's oil industry and the supply of crude to the communist-run island has dried up.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesBy 1958, the revolution had spread throughout Cuba, culminating in the fall of Havana in early 1959The decades-long US economic embargo on Cuba has been ramped up like never before: US President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs on any nation which sends oil to the stricken island.None of Cuba's traditional allies – whether Mexico, Russia, China, Vietnam or Iran – have stepped up to fill the void left by Venezuela, although the US Treasury this week said it would relax restrictions on a limited number of oil sales, to \"support the Cuban people for commercial and humanitarian use.\"The move comes amid rising tensions between Washington and Havana. Cuba's government has reported that its border guards fatally shot four people travelling in a US‑registered speedboat. It said the individuals were Cuban nationals living in the United States. According to a US official, at least one American citizen was shot dead and another injured by Cuban officials intercepting the speedboat.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US was investigating the \"highly unusual\" incident. \"Washington's old playbook on Cuba doesn't apply anymore and whoever hasn't appreciated that yet is in for a shock,\" says Cuban economist, Ricardo Torres. \"Trump is changing the rules of the game.\"Trump has declared that \"Cuba is ready to fall\", intensifying pressure on the island at its most vulnerable moment since the Cold War. Some commentators have said one of the aims of Washington's removal of Maduro in Venezuela was to deepen Cuba's economic crisis. It appears the Trump administration hopes to weaken the revolution – possibly terminally – and push for the collapse of state-run socialism on the island.The underlying calculation is straightforward: that a worsening internal crisis could create the conditions for the Cuban Revolution to unravel from within. What remains far less certain is whether such a strategy will force regime change, or whether the communist-run Cuban government will, as it has in past crises, find new ways to endure.Blackouts and 'extreme rationing'The effects of the fuel crisis are being felt the length and breadth of Cuba.Blackouts in Havana can last for 15 hours a day or more. Hospitals are in darkness with only emergency cases being admitted. Schools are often shuttered. Rubbish is piled high on street corners with no fuel for the state's garbage trucks to collect it. Scrawny and elderly residents can often be found sifting through the discarded waste.Watch: BBC examines life in Cuba without electricity and gasolineFor an island proud of the social safety net it built for its people since 1959 – universal healthcare, the eradication of illiteracy, tackling infant mortality rates and preventable diseases – the picture is bleak, and getting worse.One constant question since Maduro's arrest is: how long can Cuba hold on without new fuel supplies reaching the island?\"Perhaps the oil inventories could last for six to eight weeks,\" suggests Ricardo Torres – but he admits it's hard to know with any degree of precision. \"Cuba doesn't publish figures on fuel inventories.\"\"Extreme rationing\" could be introduced, he says, but draconian restrictions are already in place. People are limited to 20 litres of fuel at the petrol pumps, which must be paid for in US dollars.They're obliged to use a government-run app called Ticket. But the wait can last for days, even weeks. Drivers are finding more than 10,000 people ahead of them when they join the virtual queue for half a tank of petrol. Unsurprisingly in such circumstances, the price of black-market fuel has skyrocketed.AFP via Getty ImagesThere is a limit of 20 litres of fuel at the petrol pumps, which must be paid for in US dollarsDespite it all, Brenei Hernández doesn't direct his ire at Washington. Quite the opposite, in fact: he blames the Cuban state.\"I'd like Trump to take this place over. Then let's see if things get better,\" he says with unerring honesty. \"What can I tell you? I'm not going to lie,\" he adds.Regime changeHaving spent years listening to Cubans repeat anodyne revolutionary slogans when asked for their opinions on camera, it's disarming to hear such frank views expressed with no outward fear of the repercussions. Such is the level of disgust and exhaustion, the public's fear of reprisals for speaking out is beginning to evaporate.\"It's too much,\" Brenei says. \"We're only eating white rice. Hopefully I can get enough money together in the next couple of days for a packet of hot dogs, or three or four eggs.\"Lisandra already worries that her daughter will want a birthday cake this year, which is well beyond their means.\"Every day is the same hunger, the same misery,\" says Brenei HernándezSuch suffering may be part of the Trump administration's strategy of \"maximum pressure\" on Cuba. But while the methodology may be new, says Ricardo Torres, Washington's ultimate goal in Cuba remains the same as always: regime change.\"Whether the change in Cuba is something very sudden or a negotiated solution, in the end, it's regime change that Trump wants.\"The issue for Cubans is how Washington intends to make that change happen, Torres adds, with more acute pain from the oil shutout on the horizon.The Cuban government has repeatedly described the policy as inhumane, cruel and illegal under international law: \"What right does a world power have to deny fuel and the ability to function to a smaller nation?\" said Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel.It's all a far cry from the optimism of Washington's Cuba policy of a decade ago. After decades of enmity, in 2014 President Barack Obama opted to re-establish ties with the island in a historic but short-lived thaw. Hardliners in the Cuban government warned that Obama's overtures amounted to the same aim of regime change dressed up in nicer clothing. For the ordinary Cubans who lived through it, though, the diplomatic reset felt like the polar opposite of the current Trump approach.AFP via Getty ImagesIn 2014 President Barack Obama opted to re-establish ties with CubaNext month marks the tenth anniversary of Obama's visit to Havana as the first sitting US president to step foot on the island in almost a century.In front of the Cuban leader, Raúl Castro, he delivered an extraordinary address – broadcast live on state television – in which he said he had come to \"bury the last remnant of the Cold War in the Americas\" and \"extend the hand of friendship to the Cuban people\".The man who oversaw the diplomatic thaw was the then-US ambassador to Cuba, Jeffrey DeLaurentis. I asked him whether the Cuban Revolution was now facing an existential threat.\"That will depend upon what some other countries might do\", DeLaurentis replied.Venezuela's oil support was worth some 35,000 barrels of crude a day to Cuba. There have been some broad indications that Russia might send oil to the island and the Cuban foreign minister, Bruno Rodríguez, was recently in Moscow for talks with his Russian counterpart and with Russian President Vladimir Putin. So far, though, no Russian fuel tankers have docked in Cuban ports.Rodríguez also travelled to China, Vietnam and Spain trying to drum up support.Getty ImagesUS troops forcibly removed Cuba's closest ally, the Venezuelan president, Maduro, from power on 3 January\"The rush to defend and help has certainly not been as enthusiastic and as significant as we've seen in the past. But there's still a chance that other countries might take some action,\" says DeLaurentis.As to what Trump specifically wants in Cuba, the former lead US diplomat on the island says the administration is \"trying to take coercive steps to bring the government to the table or capitulate but not necessarily collapse\".\"That's a pretty risky strategy it seems to me, with a lot of potential for unintended consequences,\" he adds.Those consequences are already visible in the rapidly worsening humanitarian crisis which prompted Mexico to send tonnes of emergency aid to Cuba, including powdered milk and personal hygiene items. They're already being felt every day by the families forced to cook with firewood and the drivers in urgent need of petrol.Esteban Bello Rodríguez runs several \"almendrones\", 1950s classic American automobiles, in which he ferries tourists around the iconic spots of Havana. His trade has been heavily impacted by the fuel scarcity and the fall in tourism.Esteban Bello Rodríguez's trade has been heavily impacted by the fuel scarcity\"There's a problem here – the fuel problem – so surely the people at the top on both sides have to sit down, figure it out,\" he says bluntly. \"All I know is that a solution must be found because this is affecting the entire country – the people, nationwide. All of us.\"The real powerOn the US side, Cuba policy is largely being led by the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio – a Cuban-American son of exiles and former Florida senator.Trump says Rubio is talking to the top tier of the Cuban government and for days there's been widespread speculation over who might lead that negotiation on the Cuban side. Cuban economist Ricardo Torres says that the only dealmaker on the island is Raúl Castro, even at the revolutionary leader's advanced age of 94.AFP via Getty ImagesTrump says Marco Rubio is talking to the top tier of the Cuban government \"The only people with capacity to engage in a meaningful negotiation are people close to Raúl. The civilian government doesn't have any real power – including President Miguel Díaz-Canel\", he argues.\"The real power in Cuba is Raúl and the closed circle around him.\"Last week, the Axios news outlet reported that his grandson, Raúl Rodríguez Castro – commonly known in Cuba as \"El Cangrejo\", meaning The Crab – is the Trump administration's point of contact inside Castro's inner circle. If so, he's considered one of his grandfather's most trusted confidantes, having been his personal bodyguard, and more business-orientated than ideological, with no high-level diplomatic experience. Neither side, especially not the Cubans, have confirmed he's in talks with Rubio.\"In the case of Venezuela, the Trump administration has been very pragmatic,\" adds Torres.Rubio has seemingly been happy to deal with an interim government in Caracas under Delcy Rodríguez and Washington appears to be looking to persuade the conservative Cuban-American lobby in Florida of the benefits of negotiating with a similarly defenestrated regime in Havana.However, despite the public adherence to the \"maximum pressure\" strategy, Washington does seem to fear that total political change overnight in Venezuela or Cuba would be profoundly destabilising and could prompt a migration crisis as well as humanitarian one.AFP via Getty ImagesRubbish is often left uncollected on street cornersSeveral Cuba watchers have noted that Rubio's tone towards the island was markedly softer in recent comments he made at the Munich Security Conference, with an emphasis on economic reforms rather than a root-and-branch political transformation.\"In a way it almost sounded like a strange variant of Obama 2.0 in terms of economic reforms and so forth,\" said former ambassador DeLaurentis. \"That signalled to me that they are looking for a Delcy-like figure to negotiate with.\"\"Ten to 20 years ago, the diaspora in south Florida would have been completely opposed to that kind of approach. But I guess that now they'd give the president and the secretary the benefit of the doubt, and allow this sort of scenario to play out,\" adds DeLaurentis.Meanwhile, any visitor wanting to see the photograph of the pre-revolutionary woman cooking with firewood will have to wait. The museum has been closed for over a year for refurbishments and now there's no fuel to continue the work.In what is now the most challenging time in the island's modern history, it's not yet clear if only the Museum of the Revolution will be undergoing a renovation this year – or the Cuban Revolution itself.Top picture credit: AFP via Getty ImagesMore from InDepthBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "12 hours agoCherylann MollanGetty ImagesIndia and Israel concluded over a dozen bilateral agreements during Modi's two-day visitPrime Minister Narendra Modi has said India and Israel would deepen cooperation in defence and artificial intelligence as he concluded a two-day visit to Israel.Modi and his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu said in a joint statement on Thursday that their countries would work towards pursuing a free trade agreement.\"We've taken a historic decision to elevate our time-tested partnership to a Special Strategic Partnership,\" Modi said in a post on X.Modi's second visit to Israel since 2017 has been seen as a test of India's foreign policy as it tries to balance its ties with Israel and other Middle Eastern countries.During the visit, Modi toured Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial, and addressed the Knesset, where he condemned the October 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel.\"We feel your pain. We share your grief. India stands with Israel, firmly, with full conviction, in this moment, and beyond,\" he said.Earlier too, India had condemned the deadly attack and expressed solidarity with Israel, while also voicing concern over civilian casualties in Gaza and reiterating its support for a two-state solution.The two countries also concluded over a dozen bilateral agreements, including on cybersecurity, trade, space exploration, education, investment, agriculture and economic cooperation.Additionally, Israel pledged to allow another 50,000 Indian workers into the country over the next five years while India has said that it would extend its landmark digital payment system - UPI - to Israel, boosting digital finance cooperation between the two countries.In the joint statement, the two leaders also \"unequivocally condemned terrorism\" and cross-border terrorism and lauded US President Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza.\"India's thinking is clear: humanity must never become a victim of conflict. The Gaza peace plan has opened a path to peace. India has fully supported these efforts. We will continue dialogue and cooperation with all countries in the future,\" Modi said at a joint news conference on Thursday.While the two prime ministers have described the visit as being productive and a sign of India and Israel's growing strategic ties, Modi's visit has received some criticism at home.Jairam Ramesh, spokesperson for the main opposition Congress party, has condemned the trip and accused the Modi government of abandoning the Palestinian cause.Despite the criticism, analysts say the visit reflects India's long-term strategic interests.Kabir Taneja, executive director of the Observer Research Foundation think-tank's Middle East office earlier told the BBC that Modi's visit was \"largely driven by bilateral requirements\" but added that regional stability in the Middle East was \"critically important\" for India's broader interests.",

    "body": "9 hours agoCherylann MollanGetty ImagesKejriwal was arrested in a corruption case in March 2024A court in India has closed a corruption case against former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal almost two years after he was arrested and held in jailed for months.The Aam Admi Party (AAP) leader was arrested in March 2024, weeks before India's general election, in connection with a liquor policy which authorities alleged gave undue advantages to private retailers.On Friday, the court cleared Kejriwal and 23 others, saying there was \"no overarching conspiracy or criminal intent in the excise policy\".The judge also criticised the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for a shoddy probe and recommended an inquiry against its officials. The CBI said they would appeal against the verdict.Following Friday's order, Kejriwal broke down outside the court while talking to journalists as former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia hugged him.\"In the end, unrighteousness and injustice are defeated and truth alone prevails,\" Kejriwal said.Sisodia and AAP spokesperson Sanjay Singh were also arrested in the case in 2023 and are among the 23 cleared by the court. After their arrest, all three AAP leaders spent significant time in jail as they were repeatedly denied bail by the trial court and Delhi High Court before receiving relief from the Supreme Court.Kejriwal had accused the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which controls the police and investigating agencies in the capital, of plotting against him and targeting opposition leaders - allegations the BJP has denied.On Friday, the Rouse Avenue court in Delhi criticised the CBI for \"trying to construct  a narrative of conspiracy on the basis of mere conjecture\", legal news website Bar and Bench reported.The court also rebuked the CBI for building its case on statements made by approvers - accomplices who turn state's witnesses in exchange for a pardon or reduced sentences.\"If such conduct is allowed, it would be a grave violation of the Constitutional principles... A fair investigation is essential for a fair trial,\" the court said It added that it would recommend a departmental inquiry against CBI officials for their shoddy probe in the case.The liquor policy which led to the arrests of AAP leaders was introduced by the Kejriwal government in 2021, saying it would curb black market sales, increase revenues and ensure even distribution of liquor licences.It was withdrawn a few months later after Delhi's Lieutenant-Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena accused AAP of exploiting rules to benefit private liquor barons.A CBI case was registered in July 2022 on a complaint made by Saxena.",

    "body": "1 hour agoRobert GreenallBBC NewsWatch: Emergency services at the scene of tram derailment in central MilanAt least two people have been killed and up to 40 others are reported to have been injured, after a tram derailed in the northern Italian city of Milan.The crowded tram was travelling on the line 9 route along Milan's Viale Vittorio Veneto at about 16:00 local time (15:00 GMT) when it left the track and crashed into a building.One of the people who died, a 60-year-old man, is thought to have been a pedestrian hit by the tram, while the other fatality and most of the injured were passengers. Numerous ambulances went to the scene as reports emerged of people trapped in the wreckage.ReutersThe tram crashed into the side of a building after it derailedPassengers described hearing a noise underneath the tram, after which it veered off its track, gathered speed and went into the side of a building.\"I thought it was an earthquake. I was sitting down and I fell on the floor, along with the other passengers,\" one man told Ansa news agency. \"It was terrible.\"As it left the track, the tram apparently first hit a traffic light before smashing the window of a restaurant. A delivery rider waiting at the traffic light and a young man on a pavement narrowly escaped injury, La Repubblica website reported.\"I got on at the first stop, [Piazza della] Repubblica,\" one female passenger told Corriere della Sera. \"I was standing next to the driver, and they all crashed into me.\"\"I just heard an enormous bang,\" said 27-year-old Anna, who was in an office nearby, quoted by AFP. \"I saw a bit of the tram had gone into a shop.\"Civil protection teams set up a tent at the scene to help the injured.It is not clear what caused the derailment, although media reports suggested the tram had taken a sharp corner too quickly, as it turned out of Viale Vittorio Veneto.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed her \"deepest condolences\" over the deaths.Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala and other city officials visited the scene of the crash.Sala said the incident was a \"tragedy\" and that there would be investigations. The driver was \"very experienced\", he said, adding that he had only been on duty for an hour and was not working overtime.\"The thing that is a little strange, you see, is that there is a stop here that was skipped, and so that adds another element to what happened,\" Sala said, quoted by Reuters.  He added that the possibility the driver had suddenly been taken ill was being considered.ReutersEmergency workers have been tending to victims at the site of the crashTransport company ATM said in a statement it was \"deeply shaken\" by the incident, and said its thoughts were with the victims and their families.The incident comes at a time when the city is packed with international visitors, celebrities and journalists for Milan Fashion Week. It has also just finished hosting the Winter Olympics and is preparing to host the Paralympics.The three-car tram is one of a new bidirectional type with drivers' cabs at either end, introduced in the city only a few weeks ago, according to Corriere della Sera.",

    "body": "'Obnoxious' AI chatbot talked about its mother, customers say5 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykGetty ImagesUsers said they found Olive's \"fake banter\" frustratingAn Australian supermarket chain had to reconfigure its AI assistant, named Olive, after customers said it kept claiming to be human and even complained about its mother.Woolworths said that it had revised its scripting in light of the complaints, adding that most of the feedback on Olive's \"personality\" had been \"very positive\".Reddit users said that they had grown frustrated with the bot after it started talking about \"memories of its mother\" and engaging in \"fake banter\". The grocer is one of many major retailers to have rolled out AI customer service assistants in recent years to help with routine issues. The retailer's attempt to humanise its chat bot may have backfired, as some users said that Olive was \"obnoxious,\" while another said that they found its small talk \"aggravating.\"\"The fake banter made me haaaaate [sic] it,\" wrote one customer on Reddit.\"It asked me for my date of birth and when I gave it, it started rambling about how its mother was born in the same year\" another Reddit user, who had tried to rearrange a delivery, said.  \"The ick cringe factor whilst wasting completely unnecessary time was enough to make me hate Olive and wish her harm.\"Another user on X said that Olive \"started talking about its memories of its mother and her angry voice\" and \"kept claiming to be a real person.\" A Woolworths spokesperson said in a statement to the BBC that the responses about birthdays had been written by a human.\"Olive has been around since 2018. Over this time, customer feedback for Olive has been very positive, with many noting its personality,\" they said.\"A number of responses about birthdays were written for Olive by a team member several years ago as a more personal way for Olive to connect with customers.\"As a result of customer feedback, we recently removed this particular scripting.\"In January, the supermarket announced that it was teaming up with Google to give its virtual assistant extra features, including meal planning and sourcing ingredients from recipes uploaded by customers. Around 80% of customer service leaders told Gartner that they were exploring or deploying AI agents last year - but that only 20% of the plans were meeting expectations. Companies have said the technology can speed up transactions and save workers' time on routine tasks,  but the technology can be prone to hallucinations, causing it to behave unexpectedly. In 2024, the parcel delivery firm DPD disabled part of its online chatbot after it started writing poetry and swearing at customers. ",

    "body": "20 hours agoLucy HookerandKali Hays,Technology reporterGetty ImagesJack Dorsey co-founded TwitterTwitter co-founder Jack Dorsey says his technology firm Block is laying off almost half its workforce because artificial intelligence (AI) \"fundamentally changes what it means to build and run a company.\"\"Within the next year, I believe the majority of companies will reach the same conclusion and make similar structural changes,\" he wrote in a letter to shareholders.The layoffs will mean headcount at the company - which owns Square, CashApp and Tidal - will fall to less than 6,000 from 10,000.Block has seen several rounds of layoffs since 2024 but this is the first time it has cited AI as the reason for redundancies and marks the latest in a series of major job cuts in the tech industry.In a subsequent call discussing financial results, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, said the company was looking at cost reductions elsewhere as it ramps up AI spending. Meta, Microsoft and Google have also laid off workers as their focus has shifted to huge investments in AI.Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's co-founder and chief executive, said he is expecting \"2026 to be the year that AI dramatically changes the way we work.\"\"We're starting to see projects that used to take big teams now be accomplished by a single, very talented person,\" Zuckerberg said.Most tech companies today are using AI tools that automatically write the computer code required to operate software or websites, like Claude Code from Anthropic or Codex from OpenAI. But some analysts have suggested the immediate threat to jobs has been exaggerated by executives who want to appear ahead of the curve.According to Dorsey, only more change related to AI capabilities is on the way.\"I don't think we're early to this realisation,\" he said Thursday. \"I think most companies are late\". Block's financial report showed strong demand for its products and services, pushing up profits at the end of last year.The firm also said it will incur up to $500m (£370m) in restructuring costs as it pivots to the new strategy.Its shares rose by more than 20% in extended trading after the announcement.Dorsey is a co-founder and former chief executive of Twitter, the online micro-messaging platform that was later bought by Elon Musk and renamed X.",

    "body": "1 day agoPaulin KolaEPATrump's plans to seize control of Greenland have dominated Danish politicsDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has announced early elections - hailing the next four years as \"decisive\" for her country.\"We as Danes and as Europeans will really have to stand on our own feet,\" Frederiksen told parliament. \"We need to define our relationship with the United States,\" she added. The past few months of Danish politics have been dominated by US President Donald Trump's threats to annex Greenland - a semi-autonomous Danish territory. Last month, Trump dropped threats to use force against the fellow Nato ally to seize the Arctic island he argues is necessary to defend against possible attacks from Russia and China.Announcing the decision to call early elections on 24 March, Prime Minister Frederiksen told parliament that security \"is and will remain the very foundation of Danish politics for many, many years to come\". \"We must rearm to ensure peace on our continent,\" she said. \"We must stick together in Europe, and we must secure the future of the Danish Commonwealth\" - Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands.\"Whether I will continue to be your prime minister depends on how strong a mandate you give the Social Democrats,\" Frederiksen said mentioning her party, the lead partner in the current Danish coalition. Trump has claimed without evidence that it is \"covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place\". More than 100 US military personnel are permanently stationed at a US base in Greenland's north-western tip - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two.Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.But Trump has not abandoned his plans - he has said previously that the US needs to own Greenland to properly defend it - and talks continue over ways of establishing US control over the entire island. Both Denmark and Greenland have said they will not agree to cede sovereignty to the US. Their European allies have rallied to their support.The latest confrontation may come in the next few days if Trump follows through with an announcement that the US plans to send a boat filled with medical supplies to Greenland, alleging \"many people\" on the island are sick and \"not being taken care of\". Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen rejected the proposal, telling Trump that Greenland provides free healthcare for all citizens, unlike the US.",

    "body": "7 hours agoHafsa KhalilAFP via Getty ImagesA tank was pictured situated near the border in Chaman, Pakistan on Friday.Pakistan's defence minister has said the country is in \"open war\" with Afghanistan, after Islamabad launched airstrikes on Kabul as part of a wave of attacks across the country.\"Our patience has now run out,\" said Khawaja Muhammad Asif following the attacks.The strikes came after the Afghan Taliban announced a major offensive against Pakistani military posts near the border on Thursday night.The latest attacks follow months of clashes between the two neighbouring nations, despite agreeing to a fragile ceasefire in October.Last year's negotiations failed to reach a broader agreement for a complete end to hostilities, with both side blaming each other for not engaging seriously with talks.The Taliban said a \"retaliatory operation\" had been launched at around 20:00 local time (15:30 GMT) on Thursday.It said it had captured 19 Pakistani military posts and two bases, adding that 55 Pakistani soldiers had been killed. The BBC has not been able to verify these claims.Pakistan quickly retaliated, saying the Taliban had \"miscalculated and opened unprovoked fire on multiple locations\" across the border in its north-western province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which had been met with an \"immediate and effective response\" by Islamabad's security forces.It then launched a series of bombing raids on Afghanistan in the early hours of Friday morning, striking targets in Kabul, Kandahar and Paktika in response to what they called \"unprovoked Afghan attacks\".All three cities are close to the shared Pakistani-Afghan mountainous border that spans 2,600 km (1,615 miles).Pakistan's military spokesman Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said it had hit 22 Afghan military targets and killed more that 200 Taliban fighters. At least 12 Pakistani soldiers had died, he added.But the Taliban's spokesman Mujahid said just 13 Taliban fighters had been killed and 22 others injured, while 13 civilians had been injured and an indeterminate number killed.The BBC has not been able to verify these numbers. During these hostilities, both sides have claimed to have inflicted heavy losses on the other while suffering little damage to their own.In response to the strikes, Zabihullah Mujahid, the Afghan Taliban spokesman, published - then subsequently deleted - a post on X that the group had launched strikes early on Friday on Pakistani military positions in Kandahar and Helmand, two provinces in Afghanistan.The Afghan Taliban has said it carried out air strikes on several targets within Pakistan, on Friday morning. Sources in the Taliban government told the BBC these were with drones launched from Afghanistan.Pakistan's Information Minister Atta Tarar said its military thwarted Afghan drones targeting Swabi, Nowshera and Abbottabad, which is a military garrison city housing the army's military academy.Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said his country's forces had \"the full capability to crush any aggressive ambitions\", vowing that there would be \"no compromise\" in defending their \"beloved homeland\".In Afghanistan, Taliban officials on Friday claimed Pakistani rockets hit a refugee camp in Nangarhar - housing Afghan citizens recently arrived from Pakistan - and injured at least nine people. The BBC has not been able to verify this.Residents and local officials in the Afghan cities hit told BBC Afghan the situation appeared to have calmed down since the attacks, although people on both sides of the border remained on high alert.Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has spoken to his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan, the ministry said, and \"agreed to stay closely engaged on evolving developments\" as they both stressed the \"importance of peace and stability\".Dar, who is in Saudi Arabia for an official visit, also held a similar conversation with the country's Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud.Meanwhile, Iran has offered to \"facilitate dialogue\" between Pakistan and Afghanistan as it urged them to \"resolve their differences through good neighbourliness and dialogue\".UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper also urged the two sides to re-engage in talks, take \"immediate steps toward de‑escalation [and] avoid further harm to civilians\".While a fragile ceasefire between the two countries was agreed in October, negotiations failed to reach a broader agreement for a complete end to hostilities, with both side blaming the other for not engaging seriously with talks.Pakistan has long accused Afghanistan's Taliban government of supporting \"anti-Pakistan terrorists\", who it blames for carrying out suicide attacks in the country, including at a mosque in the capital recently.",

    "body": "Spanish opposition calls for disgraced ex-monarch to return from exile7 hours agoGuy HedgecoeBBC Madrid correspondentEPAThe former king still returns to Spain occasionally for sailing regattas and other social eventsThe leader of Spain's main opposition party has called for the disgraced former King Juan Carlos to return from self-imposed exile, due to the role he played in the transition to democracy nearly half a century ago.\"I think it would be desirable that the king emeritus return to Spain,\" Alberto Núñez Feijóo, leader of the conservative People's Party (PP), posted on social media.\"He himself has acknowledged undeniable mistakes in his past, but he who contributed to sustaining our democracy and our freedoms in a key moment should spend the last stage of his life with dignity in his own country,\" he added.Juan Carlos, who is 88, took the throne in 1975, following the death of his mentor, the dictator Francisco Franco.He helped steer the country towards becoming a parliamentary democracy and his actions were seen as instrumental in thwarting an attempted coup by pro-Franco forces in 1981, securing his popularity with many Spaniards for the decades to come.However, in 2014 he abdicated, two years after it had emerged he had been elephant hunting in Botswana with Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn, who had been his mistress, during an economic crisis in Spain. Further scandals engulfed him after it emerged he had received a $100m (£74m) payment from the late king of Saudi Arabia and had an offshore fund in Jersey.In August 2020, he left the country to live in the United Arab Emirates, where he has resided ever since. His son and heir, King Felipe, endorsed the move which has kept him out of the public eye, with the exception of occasional visits he has made to Spain for sailing regattas and other social events.The PP has previously expressed a similar opinion about the former monarch. However, this appeal has been particularly bold and its timing has reopened the debate about Juan Carlos's future.The socialist-led government, which has been critical of Juan Carlos while supporting the monarchy as an institution, sought to keep its distance from the issue.\"The decision of the king emeritus depends on him, it's up to him and the Royal Household, it's not up to the government or the opposition,\" said the Justice Minister, Félix Bolaños.However, while many, mainly on the political right, support the idea of his ending his self-exile, it would not be straightforward.ReutersJuan Carlos's return could exacerbate tensions with his son King Felipe (centre), and present logistical challenges including over his relationship with his wife, Queen Sofia (right), who has remained in SpainIn the former king's memoir, published last year, he laid bare the tensions his post-abdication life have caused with his son.\"'Don't forget that you inherit a political system that I built,'\" Juan Carlos recalled telling King Felipe, after his income as former head of state had been withdrawn and his son had decided to refuse his inheritance. \"'You can exclude me on a personal and financial level, but you cannot reject the institutional inheritance in which you have grown up.'\"His return would present logistical challenges, such as where he would live, his financial arrangements and his relationship with Queen Sofía, to whom he is still married but who has remained in Spain.\"For him to return he would need to want to return in the only way possible, which is accepting the rules that his son sets him: to behave in a transparent and exemplary way,\" said Ana Romero, an author who has written extensively about Spain's monarchy.Juan Carlos's homecoming, she said, would hinge on him putting \"in order his marriage and his financial affairs\".The Royal Household said the decision to return was his alone. However, it also specified that, in order to safeguard the \"image and reputation\" of both the former king and the monarchy, \"Juan Carlos should have his tax domicile in Spain\".",

    "body": "14 hours agoEmir NaderandSamuel Owers,BBC Eye Investigations US Department of JusticeBin Ennakhil, located in the luxury Palmeraie neighbourhood of Marrakech, has been described as an architectural masterpieceJeffrey Epstein tried to buy a multimillion-dollar palace in Morocco the day before his arrest in 2019, according to documents released by the US Department of Justice last month.Epstein had pursued acquiring Bin Ennakhil since 2011, but disputes with the seller over the price and purchase arrangement dragged on for years.The grand palace in the luxury Palmeraie neighbourhood of Marrakech has been described as an architectural masterpiece, built by 1,300 craftsmen and featuring ornate carvings and mosaics.Epstein signed a $14.95m (£11m) wire transfer on 5 July 2019, the day before his arrest, following an agreement to buy the offshore company that owned the property for €18m (£13.3m).ReutersEpstein had pursued acquiring Bin Ennakhil since 2011, but disputes over the price and purchase arrangement dragged on for yearsHe signed a $14.95m wire transfer for the property on 5 July 2019, the day before his arrest According to the released documents, the transfer was Epstein's last major financial transaction in the period before his arrest by US authorities on sex trafficking charges upon his return to New York. Three days after the arrest, Epstein's accountant Richard Kahn cancelled the wire transfer and the purchase was ultimately never completed. Morocco has no extradition treaty with the US and local media has speculated that one of Epstein's motivations to purchase the property may have been to retreat to the country to avoid arrest, if new charges were brought against him.However, a former associate of Epstein, who preferred not to be named, said the transaction showed Epstein \"had no clue\" about his imminent arrest.They added that \"it would make sense if he was thinking of a potential sanctuary where he could still live like a king\". The released files, however, contain no reference to Epstein discussing the country as a possible refuge from US authorities.US Department of JusticeIt took 1,300 craftsmen three years to build the palace, according to a property brochure Epstein's connections to Morocco go back to at least the early 2000s, with Virginia Giuffre, one of his most prominent accusers, recounting in her memoir of being flown to Tangier by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell to inspect the interior design of a number of luxury properties. At the time, Epstein wanted to redesign parts of his island home in a Moroccan style. In 2002, Epstein attended the wedding of Moroccan King Mohammed with Maxwell, having been invited by former US President Bill Clinton. Epstein's connections Epstein was convicted in the United States of soliciting underage sex in 2008, and following his release from house arrest in 2010 his interest in Morocco seems to have grown. The released files appear to show that in the same year, Epstein asked former Labour cabinet minister Peter Mandelson to find him an assistant who could \"fin[d] a house in Marrakesh\" for him.PAIn 2010 Epstein appeared to ask Peter Mandelson - pictured here following his arrest earlier this week - to find him an assistant who could \"fin[d] a house in Marrakesh\" for himThe documents detail how Epstein made periodic visits to Morocco from 2012, staying in the exclusive Palmeraie district, home to a wealthy community of expatriates including Jabor al Thani of the Qatari royal family, a close associate whom he described as his \"Arab brother\".Being mentioned or pictured in the Epstein files is not, in itself, an indication of wrongdoing.Bin Ennakhil and 'Mr Kiss'Epstein's long-term girlfriend Karyna Shuliak began leading the search for a property in Marrakech, with numerous visits and negotiations documented in emails under her name.Marc Leon, a partner of Kensington Luxury Properties, told the BBC that Epstein's focus settled on their property Bin Ennakhil  - Arabic for \"between the palm trees\" - as early as 2011.At that time, Epstein thought the palace, owned by German waste magnate Gunter Kiss, was overvalued at €55m and his initial offer was so low that Kiss was offended and refused to deal with Epstein again, the source who was close to Epstein told the BBC.Subsequently, Epstein used his girlfriend Shuliak and his network of contacts in Morocco to conduct further inspections of the property. In 2018, Epstein himself visited the property before Shuliak made final bids on the property while pretending to be acting on behalf of Leon Black, a billionaire investor friend of Epstein.Ultimately, it became clear that Epstein was the real prospective buyer but the seller \"Mr Kiss\" - as he is known in the emails - agreed to continue the negotiations, according to the documents and the source close to Epstein.Inside the Moroccan palace that caught Epstein's eye: US Department of JusticeUS Department of JusticeThe palace features ornate carvings and mosaics A space to entertain The files show that, at one stage, Kensington Luxury Properties proposed to Epstein a \"sale and tax strategy\", whereby the property would be registered with the Moroccan authorities as sold for €10m while a transaction of €20m would take place for the shares of an offshore company that owned the property.The arrangement would have allowed Epstein to register his name on the title deeds of the property while reducing the tax he would pay to Moroccan authorities.However, Kensington Luxury Properties denied to the BBC that there was an unethical or illegal attempt to minimise tax.\"This transaction did not violate any tax regulations,\" Mr Leon told the BBC. \"Mr Epstein wanted to pay registration fees in Morocco, even though he was under no obligation to do so… in order to own the property in his own name.\"The property company was at the time the local real estate representative of the renowned UK-based auction house Christie's.Ultimately, Epstein decided to purchase the property solely by paying for the shares of the offshore company and was in the process of determining how to register it in Morocco at the time of his 2019 arrest.",

    "body": "21 minutes agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorTT/ReutersSweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson joined French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot on board the Charles de Gaulle on FridayA drone jammed by the Swedish military after it was spotted near a French aircraft carrier docked in Malmo has been confirmed to be Russian, Sweden's armed forces say.The French military said the drone was spotted seven nautical miles (13km) from the Charles de Gaulle carrier, which has never visited Sweden before and is due to take part in Nato exercises in the region.In a statement, the Swedish Armed Forces said the drone was seen taking off from a nearby Russian spy ship, the Zhigulevsk.\"The incident occurred in connection with Charles de Gaulle's visit to Malmö, and the Navy acted swiftly to jam the drone,\" it added.A Kremlin spokesman previously rejected the Swedish claims as \"absurd\".Nato allies have for months reported drone sightings close to military sites and airports, including a number of incidents in Denmark and the Baltic states. An investigation was launched in December after drones flew over the Île Longue naval base, which is home to France's nuclear ballistic submarines off the Breton town of Brest.Earlier, Swedish Defence Minister Pal Jonson told public broadcaster SVT there was probably a \"strong link\" between the drone and a Russian naval vessel in Sweden's territorial waters in the Oresund Strait, between Sweden and Denmark.Jamming technology works by disrupting radio signals between the drone and its operator, often crashing or disabling the device.It is not clear what happened to the drone after it had been jammed but Jonson said the Russian ship had sailed on to the Baltic Sea.Speaking on board the carrier earlier, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said the incident was serious but not unexpected. It was very difficult to see as a coincidence, he said, adding that \"it is a Russian way of acting that we recognise from other places\".French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot, who was with Kristersson on board the aircraft carrier on Friday, praised Stockholm's handling of the incident.\"If indeed... there is a potential Russian origin for this incident, the only conclusion I would draw is that it would be a ridiculous provocation,\" he told reporters.Both armed forces have played down the drone incident, and French General Staff spokesman Col Guillaume Vernet said it had demonstrated the \"robustness\" of the Swedish response, adding that it had no impact on the French mission.AFP via Getty ImagesThe Charles de Gaulle, equipped with Rafale fighter jets, has never docked in Sweden beforeA French ex-military commander at the UN, Gen Dominique Trinquand, said if it was a Russian drone off Malmo then it was not surprising that Moscow was conducting intelligence operations in the area. \"That they would do so while the French aircraft carrier is deployed there is certainly a strategic signal,\" he told French media.The Charles de Gaulle has its own naval escort and carries Rafale fighter jets and reconnaissance planes on board, but relies on a host nation for defence while in its territorial waters.The carrier strike group's arrival in Sweden signals a change in France's military focus towards its Nato allies in Northern Europe. Under a mission called La Fayette 26, the Charles de Gaulle will take part in several long-planned Nato exercises in the Baltic and in the Atlantic, off the coast of Norway. Its mission is being seen as a response to Moscow after a lengthy period of Russian hybrid warfare.Meanwhile, Sweden's coast guard has opened an investigation into a fuel spill in the port of Malmo, where two oil tankers are docked, as well as the Charles de Gaulle.The oil spill was detected on Thursday and although the cause is not yet known, the port has told Swedish media it is not linked to the aircraft carrier.",

    "body": "4 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporterAFP via Getty ImagesCanadian officials have criticised OpenAI for failing to report the suspect's ChatGPT account to police, and say they believe the shooting could have been preventedOpenAI says it will strengthen its safety measures after the company failed to alert police about the Tumbler Ridge shooting suspect's ChatGPT account despite it being flagged internally months before the attack.In an open letter to Canadian officials, the company said the suspect was able to create a second account after the first was banned, slipping past its internal detection systems.It said it has also since changed how it reports accounts to police, and that the suspect's activity would be referred to law enforcement if it were flagged today.An account linked to the suspect, 18‑year‑old Jesse Van Rootselaar, was banned by OpenAI in June 2025 — seven months before the shooting.Eight people were killed in the 10 February attack, which took place at a residence and the local secondary school in Tumbler Ridge, a small town in British Columbia, Canada. The victims included the suspect's mother and 11‑year‑old stepbrother, as well as five young school children and an educator. Van Rootselaar died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said. The shooting was one of the deadliest in Canadian history. Canada summons OpenAI senior staff over Tumbler Ridge shootingWho were the victims of the shootings in Tumbler Ridge, Canada?Canadian officials met OpenAI senior staff earlier this week in Ottawa, after the company revealed it had shut down a ChatGPT account used by the suspect in June 2025 for violating usage terms.That account was not reported to police, however, because it did not at the time meet its threshold for \"credible and imminent planning\" of serious violence, the company said.In its letter to Canadian officials on Thursday, penned by OpenAI's vice-president of global policy and shared with media outlets, the company said it had implemented a series of changes in recent months, including enlisting the help of \"mental health and behavioural experts\" to assess cases and making the criteria for referral to police \"more flexible\". Because of the changes, OpenAI said it would have reported the suspect's ChatGPT account under the new guidelines.The letter does not specify when those new protocols took effect.The company also revealed that the suspect was able to create a second account, despite being flagged by OpenAI systems in the past. That second account was shared with police after the shooting, it said.\"We commit to strengthening our detection systems to better prevent attempts to evade our safeguards and prioritize identifying the highest risk offenders,\" the company wrote.OpenAI said it will also establish a direct point of contact with Canadian law enforcement so it can quickly flag any possible future cases with \"potential for real world violence\". That direct line of communication is one of the requests made by Canadian officials following their meeting with OpenAI staff on Tuesday.Canada's AI minister Evan Solomon has described what occurred as a \"failure\". He told reporters that he was left \"disappointed\" after the meeting, saying that he did not hear \"any substantial new safety protocols\" from OpenAI.Solomon also opened the door for future legislation on the matter if OpenAI fails to implement changes quickly. \"All options for us are on the table, because at the end of the day, Canadians want to feel safe,\" Solomon after Tuesday's meeting. British Columbia Premier David Eby has said he believes the shooting would have been prevented if the company had alerted police to Van Rootselaar's account months ago.\"They tragically missed the mark in [not] bringing this information forward. The consequences of that will be borne by the families of Tumbler Ridge for the rest of their lives,\" Eby told reporters on Thursday.Eby added that OpenAI Sam Altman has agreed to meet to discuss the company's safety policies. \"I think it's important that Mr Altman hear about how his team's decision not to bring this information forward has resulted in devastation,\" he said.",

    "body": "20 hours agoMaia DaviesandChris GrahamWatch: \"I'm not going to speculate\", says Marco Rubio on Cuba boat shootingAt least one American citizen was shot dead and another injured by Cuban officials intercepting a speedboat off its coast on Wednesday, a US official has said.Border guards shot dead four people and injured the remaining six aboard the Florida-registered speedboat. Cuba accused the 10 people on the boat of planning \"an infiltration with terrorist aims\" and said they opened fire first.A third person was on a US K-1 visa - for fiancées of American citizens - the US official said. The boat's owner alleged the vessel had been stolen by an employee.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had said Washington was investigating the \"highly unusual\" incident.Cuban authorities had said all 10 were Cuban nationals residing in the US.They also identified an 11th person they said had been arrested and had confessed to being part of the alleged plot.The interior ministry said earlier that the speedboat had entered its territorial waters and was \"one nautical mile off Cayo Falcones\" on the country's northern coast when it was intercepted.It said the commander of the Cuban boat was injured in the firefight that ensued.The Cuban authorities added that most of the passengers on the US-registered boat had \"prior records involving criminal and violent activity\".Handguns, assault rifles and improvised explosive devices were recovered from the speedboat, along with other tactical gear, according to the statement.The deadly shooting comes at a time of increased tension between the two countries. Rubio has said the speedboat incident was not a US operation and no US government personnel were involved.Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel on Thursday vowed to defend the Caribbean country against aggression.\"Cuba will defend itself with determination and firmness against any terrorist and mercenary aggression that seeks to affect its sovereignty and national stability,\" Díaz-Canel said on X.\"Cuba does not attack, nor threaten,\" Díaz-Canel added.Cuba's deputy foreign minister Carlos Fernández de Cossío said the US had shown a \"willingness\" to cooperate on \"clarifying these regrettable events\".BBC Verify checked the speedboat's registration details provided by the Cuban embassy in the US (FL7726SH, Florida registered), but they yielded no ownership details or tracking history on any of the platforms the BBC relies on.ReutersRubio has said it was not a US operation and no US government personnel were involvedCuba's interior ministry has in the past denounced other incursions into its territorial waters by privately owned US boats it said were engaged in smuggling Cubans from the Caribbean island to the US.The incident also comes almost 30 years to the day since Cuban defence forces shot down two small civilian planes belonging to Brothers to the Rescue, a US-based group that searched for rafts carrying migrants from Cuba to the US.Four people aboard were killed in the 1996 incident, triggering outrage in the US.Last month, following the seizure of Venezuela's Maduro in a US military operation, US President Donald Trump told Cuba to \"make a deal\" or face unspecified consequences.The move has further exacerbated the already crippling oil and fuel shortages Cuba has been suffering for years.On Wednesday, however, the US Treasury said it would ease some small private sector transactions, including oil sales, to \"support the Cuban people, for commercial and humanitarian use\".",

    "body": "7 hours agoYogita LimayeSouth Asia and Afghanistan correspondentWatch: Pakistan releases footage it claims shows strikes on KabulResidents of Kabul's District 6 were awakened abruptly on Thursday night by the sound of an explosion that shook their homes. They rushed out in the street and heard jets flying overhead.It was a night that saw a serious escalation in violence between Afghanistan and Pakistan, with Pakistan launching airstrikes in Afghanistan - including its capital city, Kabul. Other places struck were in Paktia and Kandahar provinces, the latter a stronghold and the birthplace of the Taliban movement.Hostilities between the two sides have been ongoing for months, yet the answer to who started the aggression depends on who you ask.Earlier in the night, Afghanistan's Taliban government said it had launched a major ground operation against Pakistani military positions near the border, claiming to have captured several posts, and also claiming to have captured and killed Pakistani soldiers. The Taliban government says they were \"retaliatory operations\" - a response after \"Pakistani military elements carried out an incursion into Afghan territory, violated Afghan sovereignty, and caused the deaths of several civilians, including women and children\".They were referring to an earlier round of Pakistani airstrikes carried out less than a week ago - on the night of 21 February - targeting the eastern Nangarhar and Paktika provinces. The United Nations has said it has credible reports that 13 Afghan civilians were killed in those strikes.AFP via Getty ImagesThis latest escalation comes days after Pakistan carried out air strikes inside Afghanistan following suicide blasts on its soil (file photo)Islamabad has a different view. It says its airstrikes have not targeted civilians but instead have targeted militant hideouts in Afghanistan, specifically those of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) or the Pakistani Taliban, which Pakistan's government refers to as Fitna al Khawarij.Pakistan also alleges the attacks are being carried out at the behest of the TTP's Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers, who are being supported by the Taliban government.The Taliban government repeatedly maintains that its territory is not being used to threaten the security of any country, and that Pakistan's actions in Afghanistan are \"unprovoked\".Qatar and Turkey mediated between the two sides, with talks held in Doha and Istanbul. A fragile ceasefire followed, but the negotiations failed to bring about a ceasing of hostilities between the two sides.Both countries blamed the other for not engaging seriously in diplomacy.Militarily, Pakistan has the upper hand by a long mile. It is a significant military power with hundreds of tanks and aircraft, and advanced defence technology.ReutersThe Taliban do not have the upper hand militarily, but are experienced in guerrilla and unconventional warfare Afghanistan's Taliban government has military equipment left behind by the former Afghan and foreign forces. And despite sanctions, reports suggest it has been able to purchase some military equipment through the black market.So far, there's no evidence that it has the planes or the capability to launch airstrikes deep into Pakistan.But as a group, the Taliban sustained more than 20 years of war against the US and its Nato allies, so its capacity to carry out unconventional and guerrilla warfare is well evidenced.And in the latest stand-off, the Taliban government used drones to strike targets in Pakistan. Drones, which are cheap, small and easy to use, will undoubtedly alter the nature of this conflict like they have changed battlefields around the world.The difficulty with assessing how far the latest escalation might go, stems in part from the lack of verified information available from either side.The Taliban government does not allow easy access to foreign journalists, and verifying information, particularly from border areas, is even more challenging.In Pakistan too, gathering verified information from border areas independently is not easy.Trade between the two countries has been closed since October 2025, the longest in decades which is affecting small businesses in Afghanistan, and the availability of supplies, including crucial medicines.For ordinary Afghans, reeling under a severe crisis of hunger and poverty, and living under the Taliban government's stringent restrictions, the one positive since 2021 was that after four decades of war, they didn't have to worry about bombs falling on them and their families.That feeling of relative security has now been punctured by the violence of the past six months.Additional reporting by Usman Zahid and Mahfouz Zubaide",

    "body": "Former US diplomat sentenced to life for abusing two girls in Burkina Faso8 hours agoChris EwokorUS embassy/ FacebookFode Sitafa Mara was employed by the United States embassy when he abused the two girlsA United States citizen has been sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of sexually abusing two teenage girls while working at the US embassy in Burkina Faso.The US Department of Justice said 41-year-old Fode Sitafa Mara, from Maryland, was sentenced on Wednesday following a two-week trial in October 2025 in the state's federal District Court.A jury found him guilty of four counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a minor, as well as attempted coercion and enticement of a minor and attempted obstruction of justice.The prosecution was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative launched by the Justice Department in 2006 to combat child sexual exploitation.Prosecutors said the offences took place in 2022 and 2023 in Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, where Mara was employed by the United States embassy.According to evidence presented in court, the abuse occurred at a residence leased for US diplomatic personnel. Because the property was reserved for official use, it fell under US jurisdiction, allowing American authorities to prosecute the case.Reports say the two victims, who were aged 13 and 15 when the abuse began, came from a vulnerable background. Prosecutors said Mara exploited their circumstances over the course of about a year.\"His crimes were reprehensible. While no sentence could undo the harm he caused, today's outcome demonstrates that those who abuse children – domestically or abroad – will face significant consequences in the American justice system,'' said Assistant Attorney General A Tysen Duva.He used the girls' mother's life-threatening illness as an opportunity to demand sex, telling them he could not help them without receiving something in return, said the Office of Public Affairs.Mara had provided the girls with phones so he could summon them while his wife was away at work, it added.He was also convicted of sending sexually explicit messages to one of the girls and attempting to persuade a housekeeper to mislead investigators.The case was investigated by the US authorities with assistance from Burkina Faso.\"Our message is clear, those who prey on our children will pay a hefty price,\" said US attorney Kelly Hayes for the District of Maryland.In statements issued after sentencing, US officials said the life term reflected the seriousness of the crimes and underscored the government's commitment to prosecuting child sexual abuse, including offences committed abroad by American citizens.More about Burkina Faso from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

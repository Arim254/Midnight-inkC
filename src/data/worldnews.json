    "body": "France's highest court has upheld a sentence against former French President Nicolas Sarkozy over the illegal financing of his 2012 re-election campaign.He was found guilty of overspending on his campaign, then hiring a PR firm named Bygmalion to cover it up.Sarkozy, 70, was handed the one-year sentence in 2024 of which six months were suspended, meaning they could be served by wearing an electronic tag instead of going to jail.He has always denied all allegations. Prosecutors in the case said Sarkozy's UMP party spent nearly double the €22.5m (£19.4m) cap on his campaign, splurging on lavish campaign rallies and events.To hide the costs, UMP then asked Bygmalion to invoice the party, rather than the campaign.Today's is the second definitive conviction for the former president, who was in power from 2007 to 2012.Last December the High Court of Appeal upheld a corruption conviction and Sarkozy had to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet for six months.Then, in September, he was sentenced to five years in jail after being found guilty of criminal conspiracy.He spent 20 days in jail before he was released earlier in November. An appeal trial will be held next year. Until then Sarkozy will be subject to strict judicial supervision and barred from leaving France.Days after his release, Sarkozy's team announced the former president was writing a book about his three weeks in jail, titled \"A prisoner's diary\". An excerpt from the book was published on social media: \"In prison there is nothing to see, and nothing to do. I forget the silence that does not exist at La Santé [prison], where there is much to listen to. Here, the noise is, unfortunately, constant. But - like in the desert - inner life strengthens in jail.\"",

    "body": "A Chicago man who allegedly doused a woman in gasoline and lit her on fire on 17 November was a \"career criminal\", the White House has said. Lawrence Reed who was arrested for the crime had 72 prior arrests that include eight felony convictions and seven misdemeanours, according to the White House. The victim, 26-year-old Bethany MaGee, survived the attack but is \"now fighting for her life with horrific burns\", the White house said in a statement.In court on Monday, Mr Reed yelled three times in succession \"I'm guilty\", after the judge warned he could receive a life sentence for charges that include committing a terrorist attack, according to reports from inside the courtroom. The White House has sought to blame the incident on Democrats' policies on crime, casting them as \"soft\". Both the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago are led by Democrats, and President Donald Trump is currently seeking to withhold federal funds from Illinois over its elimination of \"cash bail\", where an arrested person posts a sum of money to be released from jail before trial.The suspect \"was walking free because of the radical, dangerous 'no cash bail' law proudly signed by Governor JB Pritzker and celebrated by Chicago's defund-the-police Mayor Brandon Johnson\", the White House said in a statement it released on Tuesday. Mayor Johnson said in a statement that the attack \"was a tragic incident, and the Mayor's prayers are with the victim and her family.\"Mr Reed, 50, has a history of mental illness and has been arrested 72 times since he turned 18, according to a Chicago affiliate of the BBC's partner CBS News.In August, he was charged with aggravated battery for allegedly hitting a social worker and after his arrest was released with electronic monitoring against prosecutors' objections. The attack against Ms MaGee happened while she was \"minding her own business and reading her phone\", prosecutors said. According to the criminal complaint, she was approached by Mr Reed arriving from the back of the train car who then doused her with gasoline before she ran.As he chased her, the complaint said, Mr Reed ignited the rest of the liquid in the bottle and set Ms MaGee on fire. Footage of the incident appeared to show Mr Reed watching Ms MaGee as she rolled on the floor engulfed in flames attempting to extinguish the fire. Last week,  Mayor Johnson said the attack \"should have never happened\", characterising it as \"an absolute failure of our criminal justice as well as our mental health institutions\". He said the suspect clearly faced mental health challenges and presented a danger to himself and the community.As a county commissioner, Johnson in 2020 introduced a nonbinding resolution to redirect funds from police and jails to other public services, but while running for mayor in 2023 he promised not to cut police spending.",

    "body": "Venezuela has banned six major international airlines from landing in the country after they failed to meet a 48-hour deadline to resume flights there.The airlines had temporarily suspended their routes into the capital, Caracas, after the US warned of \"heightened military activity\" in the area.Angered by this, the Venezuelan government issued the carriers with an ultimatum that expired on Wednesday. While a number of smaller airlines continue to fly to Venezuela, thousands of passengers have been affected.The US has deployed a large force to waters off Venezuela, which it says is to combat drug trafficking but which Venezuela's leader has denounced as an attempt to overthrow him. Venezuela's civil aviation authority, which reports to the country's ministry of transport, announced on Wednesday that Iberia, TAP Portugal, Gol, Latam, Avianca and Turkish Airlines would lose their landing and take-off rights with immediate effect.In a reference to the heightened US military activity off the coast of Venezuela, it also accused the airlines of \"joining the actions of state terrorism promoted by the United States government and unilaterally suspending air commercial operations\".The US has deployed 15,000 troops and the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, to within striking distance of Venezuela.Tracking build-up of US military planes and warships near VenezuelaThe US says the aim of the deployment, the largest by the US in the region since it invaded Panama in 1989, is to combat drug trafficking.US forces have carried out at least 21 strikes on boats they say were carrying drugs, killing more than 80 people. However, they have not provided evidence that the boats carried drugs and many analysts have pointed out that the US deployment is unusually large for a counter-narcotics operation. The Venezuelan government thinks the aim of the operation is to depose President Nicolás Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced by the Venezuelan opposition and many foreign nations as rigged. Amid the rising tensions, the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) issued a warning on Friday to flight operators operating in Maiquetía, the international airport serving Caracas. It urged airlines \"to exercise caution... at all altitudes due to the worsening security situation and heightened military activity in and around Venezuela\".It was in the wake of that warning that the now-banned airlines suspended their flights to Venezuela. An attempt by aviation industry body Iata to defuse the situation - by stressing that its member airlines were keen to restore operations - failed to appease the Venezuelan government.In recent days, both Maduro and his US counterpart Donald Trump have signalled a willingness to hold direct talks.Asked about it on Air Force One, Trump said that he \"might talk\" to Maduro, but also warned that \"we can do things the easy way, that's fine, and if we have to do it the hard way that's fine, too\".Maduro, meanwhile, uploaded a video of himself driving around Caracas pointing to Christmas decorations, in what appeared to be an attempt to show that life in the city was going on as normal.",

    "body": "Police in Malawi are investigating how four police dogs went missing from a presidential palace in the capital, Lilongwe, during the political transition in September.Godfrey Arthur Jalale, who served as State House deputy chief of staff under former President Lazarus Chakwera, has been arrested in connection with the theft of the four German Shepherds. He denies the charge. Chakwera vacated the palace after losing the elections to President Peter Mutharika. Late on Wednesday, police denied reports that Chakwera had been arrested but confirmed securing a search warrant for his residence after information suggested the stolen dogs were being kept there.Chakwera, who came second with 33% of the vote in the September election, is facing numerous allegations of public resources mismanagement, especially during the handover.His Malawi Congress Party (MCP) has accused Mutharika's administration of  \"harassing and intimidating\" the former leader. Chakwera has not commented.Local media have reported the theft of state property from two presidential residences - the Kamuzu Palace in Lilongwe, and Sanjika Palace, in Blantyre, the country's second biggest city.The four dogs, valued at $2,300 (£1,700), were taken out of the palace between 19 September and 4 October, according to the state prosecutors. In a statement on Wednesday, police said they had \"intensified investigations following reports of property looting\" from Kamuzu Palace.  \"The Malawi Police Service assures the public that the investigation is progressing smoothly,\" it added. MCP MPs boycotted parliamentary sessions on Wednesday and camped out at Chakwera's residence in Lilongwe amid reports that he faced arrest following a heightened police presence, local media reported.Chakwera, a pastor before entering politics, accepted defeat and has kept a low profile since the election. He made his first public appearance last week when he announced that he had accepted a Commonwealth appointment to help mediate in Tanzania's post-election unrest. Mutharika, who first served as president between 2014 and 2020, campaigned on a pledge of a \"return to proven leadership\" - which resonated with Malawian voters. He returned to power in a country that is in deep crisis, with a severe shortage of fuel and foreign currency.The former law professor was rarely seen in public during the campaign, in contrast to Chakwera who held numerous rallies across Malawi.As a result, speculation about Mutharika's health is rife and there are questions about whether he has the stamina to lead Malawi again at the age of 85.",

    "body": "Australia's landmark social media ban for children is being challenged in the nation's highest court, with two teenagers alleging the law is unconstitutional as it robs them of their right to free communication.From 10 December, social media firms - including Meta, TikTok and YouTube - must ensure that Australians aged under 16 cannot hold accounts on their platforms.The law, which is being watched closely around the world, was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful content and algorithms. However, 15-year-olds Noah Jones and Macy Neyland - backed by a rights group - will argue the ban completely disregards the rights of children.\"We shouldn't be silenced. It's like Orwell's book 1984, and that scares me,\" Macy Neyland said in a statement.After news of the case broke, Communications Minister Anika Wells told parliament the government would not be swayed.\"We will not be intimidated by threats. We will not be intimidated by legal challenges. We will not be intimidated by big tech. On behalf of Australian parents, we will stand firm,\" she said.The Digital Freedom Project (DFP) announced the case had been filed in the High Court on Wednesday. Teenagers rely on social media for information and association, and a ban could hurt the nation's most vulnerable kids - young people with disability, First Nations youth, rural and remote kids and LGBTIQ+ teenagers - the most, the group said on their website.Led by a New South Wales parliamentarian, John Ruddick, DFP said their challenge would hinge on the ban's impact on political communication, and whether it was proportional to the law's aims.Other measures to improve online safety should be used instead, the group argued, pointing to digital literacy programmes, the forced introduction of age-appropriate features for platforms, and age assurance technologies which have greater privacy protections.Noah Jones argued the government's policy was \"lazy\". \"We are the true digital natives and we want to remain educated, robust, and savvy in our digital world... They should protect kids with safeguards, not silence.\"Australian media have previously reported that Google, which owns YouTube, has also been considering launching a constitutional challenge.Though opposed by the tech companies who will be charged with enforcing it, the ban is supported by most Australian adults, according to polls. However, some mental health advocates say it may cut kids off from connection, and others say it could push youngsters to even-less-regulated corners of the internet.",

    "body": "'Once in 300 years' rain hits Thai city as floods ravage South East Asia1 day agoKelly NgWatch: People cling to floating debris during catastrophic floods in ThailandParts of Thailand are battling record floods, which have killed at least 33 people and prompted authorities to deploy military ships and helicopters to support relief efforts.The deluge has hit 10 provinces across the country's south over the past week, with the city of Hat Yai, a business hub bordering Malaysia, recording its heaviest rainfall in 300 years - 335mm in a single day.Photos show vehicles and houses submerged in the city, while desperate residents await rescue on their rooftops.Relentless rains have also ravaged neighbouring countries. In Vietnam, the death toll has risen to 98 in a week, while in Malaysia, more than 19,000 people have been forced from their homes.In Indonesia, at least 19 people have been killed and at least seven others remained buried under landslides in North Sumatra, according to the Indonesian National Search and Rescue Agency.More than 2 million people in Thailand have been affected by the floods, but just 13,000 have been moved to shelters. The vast majority are cut off and unable to get help, according to Reuters news agency.The Thai military, which has been put in charge of tackling the crisis, said it is preparing to dispatch an aircraft carrier and a flotilla of 14 boats loaded with relief supplies, along with field kitchens that are said to be able to deliver 3,000 meals a day.Medical teams on board the aircraft carrier will convert it into a \"floating hospital\" if required, the navy said.ReutersA drone view shows dozens of vehicles at least partially submerged in a carpark Hat YaiBoats, high-clearance trucks, and jet skis have also been deployed to evacuate residents, said the governor of Songkhla province, where Hat Yai is located.The cabinet on Tuesday declared Songkhla a disaster zone, freeing up funds for relief.However, many people remain stranded amid the rising waters. A volunteer rescue group, the Matchima Rescue Center, told Reuters it had been inundated with thousands of calls in the last three days, with people asking to be evacuated.People have also posted urgent calls for help on Matchima's Facebook page. \"Many people are trapped... Please help,\" one user wrote. \"It's very difficult right now. The water has reached the second floor, where there are children, the elderly, the sick, and the disabled!!!\" Another wrote that his household had been waiting for help for three days: \"Every second is crucial now... Please help share. My [phone's] battery is at 40%. Thank you everyone.\"Some also wrote about not having had any food and water for days.A clip that has gone viral on social media shows three young boys hanging from power lines, trying to inch their way to safety while brown murky waters continue to rise below them.In Malaysia, more than 19,000 people have been evacuated to safety, with 126 evacuation centres set up in the northern border areas.In the states of Kelantan and Perlis, rescue teams waded through knee-deep floodwaters to evacuate residents in areas where rising waters had cut off access to roads.Heavy seasonal rain is common around this time of year in South East Asia, but this year has seen exceptionally high levels of flooding in the region.ReutersThe Thai military said it is preparing to dispatch an aircraft carrier and a flotilla of 14 boats loaded with relief supplies",

    "body": "South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has described as \"regrettable\" the announcement by US President Donald Trump that South Africa would not be invited to take part in next year's G20 summit in Florida.In a social media post, Trump said South Africa had refused to hand over the G20 presidency to a US embassy representative at last week's summit in Johannesburg.\"Therefore, at my direction, South Africa will NOT be receiving an invitation to the 2026 G20, which will be hosted in the Great City of Miami, Florida next year.\"Members of the G20 – a gathering of the world's biggest economies - do not need an invite but can possibly be barred through visa restrictions.South Africa's presidential spokesman Vincent Magwenya said they \"should by now accept\" at the highest level of political leadership that \"there won't be a reset of the relationship\" between the two countries despite the efforts they had undertaken.\"If visas are denied, well, then we will have to move on and look beyond the G20 in the US,\" he told the BBC, in response to a question on how they would proceed.He said they were focused on working with other G20 members to carry the momentum of the issues deliberated at the summit in Johannesburg.Trump boycotted the summit because of a widely discredited claim that South Africa's white minority is the victim of large-scale killings and land grabs.Ramaphosa said in a statement that the US had been expected to participate in the G20 meetings, \"but unfortunately, it elected not to attend the G20 Leaders Summit in Johannesburg out of its own volition\". He however noted that some US businesses and civil society entities were present.He said that since the US delegation was not there, \"instruments of the G20 Presidency were duly handed over to a US Embassy official at the Headquarters of South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation\".The low-key handover appears to have further angered Trump, who has been critical of the South African government's domestic and foreign policies.He has in the past claimed that a white genocide was taking place in South Africa, and on Wednesday he said the government was \"killing white people and randomly allowing their farms to be taken from them\".The South African government has consistently rejected such claims as widely discredited and lacking reliable evidence.Ramaphosa said it was regrettable that despite efforts to reset relations with the US, Trump continued \"to apply punitive measures against South Africa based on misinformation and distortions about our country\".In the Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump said South Africa had \"demonstrated to the world they were not a country worthy of membership anywhere\" and announced a stop to \"all payments and subsidies to them, effective immediately\".South African officials have called for solidarity and urged other G20 members to defend the integrity of the gathering and the rights of all its member states.The G20 summit, which was for the first time held in Africa, ended with a joint declaration committing to \"multilateral co-operation\" on climate change mitigation and economic inequality.The declaration was adopted despite objections from the US, which has accused South Africa of weaponising its leadership of the group this year.Additional reporting by Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg",

    "body": "5 hours agoJames ChaterWatch: US President Donald Trump says alleged gunman was Afghan nationalThe US has suspended processing all immigration requests from Afghans, after an Afghan man was identified as the suspect in the shooting of two National Guard soldiers near the White House.The US Citizenship and Immigration Services said the decision was made pending a review of \"security and vetting protocols\".The suspect of Wednesday's shooting, which left two National Guard members critically injured, is said to have arrived in the US from Afghanistan in September 2021.US President Donald Trump said the attack was an \"act of terror\", adding that he would take steps to remove foreigners \"from any country who does not belong here\". Tens of thousands of Afghans entered the US under special immigration protections following the chaotic US withdrawal from the country in 2021 under former President Joe Biden.The Department of Homeland Security named the suspect in a press release as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, \"a criminal alien from Afghanistan\". It said Lakanwal had entered the US during the presidency of Joe Biden in September 2021, under a programme for Afghans named called Operation Allies Welcome.At the time, the Taliban had taken back control of Afghanistan following a chaotic withdrawal of US forces.  An official told the BBC's US news partner CBS that Lakanwal had applied for asylum in 2024, and that his application had been granted earlier this year. Lakanwal's is reportedly 29 years old, and he is said to not be co-operating with authorities' investigation.Trump said following the shooting that the US \"must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden\".The Joint Task Force DC, which is co-ordinating the National Guard deployments to the nation's capital, said the attack took place at around 14:15 EST (19:15 GMT) on Wednesday near the Farragut Square Metro Station.The soldiers had been on a high-visibility patrol near the corner of 17th and I streets - a busy lunch spot for office workers.Metropolitan Police Assistant Chief Jeff Carroll said the suspect \"came around the corner\" and \"immediately started firing\", adding that the soldiers had been \"ambushed\".Other National Guard members nearby heard the gunfire and intervened, holding the suspect down until police arrived, he said.The suspect was shot four times, law enforcement sources told CBS.One witness described to the BBC his experience of hearing gunshots, as people ran in panic and tried to take shelter in a nearby shop.Another witness, who was in his car close to the metro station, showed the BBC footage he took of the two soldiers lying on the street in their uniforms while being treated by medics. Details on the identities of the soldiers have not yet been provided by officials.A third person, apparently the alleged gunman, was also seen on the pavement being treated.In the wake of the attack, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the president had asked him to send 500 more National Guard members to the American capital.\"This will only stiffen our resolve to ensure that we make Washington DC safe and beautiful,\" the Pentagon chief said.There are currently nearly 2,200 National Guard troops in the city.They are a reservist force that can be activated to serve as military troops, but have limited power as they cannot enforce the law or make arrests.The troops were deployed in August to tackle what Trump called \"out of control\" crime in Washington.Overall crime in the city has fallen since the force was sent, which Trump credits to the troops' presence on the streets.There have been similar deployments in other Democratic-led cities across the US, which have faced legal challenges by opponents who accuse the Trump administration of overreach.Watch: How the shooting of two National Guard members unfoldedTrump imposed a travel ban on nationals of Afghanistan - and 11 other countries - earlier this year.Afghan nationals holding Special Immigration Visas - available to those who worked directly with the US military and feared retribution from the Taliban as a result of that co-operation - were among a few exceptions to the sweeping bans. The Taliban returned to power following the US withdrawal in 2021.Trump has also ended a programme that granted deportation protections for thousands of people from Afghanistan.The temporary protected status programme allowed migrants to get work permits if the US government deemed it unsafe for them to return to their home countries due to war.Additional reporting by Tom BatemanFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "Firefighters search for hundreds still missing in devastating Hong Kong tower blocks fire1 hour agoJaroslav LukivandFan WangWatch: Deadly fire engulfs Hong Kong apartment blocksFirefighters are still searching for hundreds of missing people after a massive fire tore through multiple high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong.At least 75 people died in the blaze - the city's deadliest in more than 70 years - at Wang Fuk Court's complex, which is home to thousands. The tower blocks had been undergoing extensive renovations - and while the exact cause for the fire is unclear, police say materials on the outside of the buildings may have facilitated its spread.Three construction company executives have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and gross negligence, and Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee has vowed to launch a comprehensive investigation.The fire, which tore through seven of eight tower blocks in Tai Po district on Wednesday, is now \"basically under control\", Lee said. It started at 14:51 local time (06:51 GMT) on Wednesday, with flames and thick clouds of grey smoke seen billowing from the towers, dominating the city's skyline.By 18:22 local time, officials upgraded the fire to a level five - the most serious category.Firefighter Ho Wai-ho, 37, was among those killed in the blaze. He was found collapsed at the scene about 30 minutes after contact with him was lost.Eleven other firefighters are also injured, the fire department said.The fierce heat of the blaze, as well as dangerous debris and the risk posed from collapsing scaffolding, has hampered rescue efforts, but the fire department has so far rescued 55 people.\"Despite the complex conditions at the scene, the firefighters' rescue efforts will not stop,\" Lee told a news conference on Thursday evening.More than 270 people remain unaccounted for, while 76 people are injured, Hong Kong's fire service said.ReutersReutersAs firefighters bring the blaze under control, the extent of the damage is yet to be assessedThick smoke billowed into the sky as bystanders watched onThe mood in Hong Kong has shifted from shock to anguish, as questions grow regarding who should be held accountable for the blaze.Anger has been building on social media, especially after several residents revealed in interviews that they did not hear a fire alarm when the fire broke out.Kiko Ma, 33, who has an apartment in the housing complex, told the BBC that some of the fire alarms had been turned off during the renovation, as construction workers regularly used fire escapes to enter and exit the buildings.Reports of their complaints last year over renovation plans have also resurfaced, and are circulating widely online. Residents had taken issue with high renovation fees and questioned whether the materials used complied with fire-safety regulations.Mesh material and plastic sheets which were found on the outside of the buildings are not believed to be fireproof, while polystyrene was also found on the buildings' windows.These materials may have allowed the fire to spread faster, police said.\"We have reason to believe that those in charge at the company were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties,\" a police spokesperson said.Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption has said it will launch a criminal investigation over the renovation works.Fire safety expert Prof Jiang Liming, from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, said he believed the bamboo scaffolding connecting the apartment blocks may have also helped the fire grow.Bamboo scaffolding is a common sight across Hong Kong - a city known for its high-rise buildings - and is widely used in construction.Lee said he had arranged inspections of \"all housing estates undergoing major repairs\" to check the \"safety of scaffolding and building materials\".He added that the government was considering a review of bamboo scaffolding and whether they should be replaced by metal frameworks.Wang Fuk Court in Hong Kong's northerly suburban Tai Po district was built in 1983 and consists of eight tower blocks providing 1,984 apartments for around 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census.Nearly 40% of its residents are estimated to be at least 65 years old. Some have lived in the subsidised housing estate since it was built.China's President Xi Jinping has expressed sympathy for the victims and urged that every effort be made to put out the fire and minimise the losses, state media reported.Hong Kong's deadliest fire on record killed 176 people in 1948 and was caused by a ground-floor explosion at a five-storey warehouse.",

    "body": "1 day agoHafsa KhalilWatch: Trump says Witkoff doing \"standard negotiation\" in talks with RussiaDonald Trump has defended his special envoy Steve Witkoff as doing the \"standard thing\" after a leaked recording appeared to show him advising a Russian official on how to appeal to the US president.Trump told reporters on Wednesday that he had not heard the audio, but that Witkoff was doing \"what a dealmaker does\" to \"sell\" a US-authored peace plan to both Russia and Ukraine.The leaked call from last month emerged days after the 28-point draft peace plan was presented by the US, which largely reflected Russian positions on ending its full-scale war in Ukraine.Witkoff has visited Moscow several times this year and will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin again next week.He has never gone to Kyiv in his role as special envoy, though other US officials have visited and US army secretary Dan Driscoll went to Kyiv this week. Trump says he will hold further talks with the Ukrainians.Diplomatic talks have continued after the initial draft plan was criticised by Ukrainian and European leaders as being too favourable to Russia. Among the proposals was handing Russia territory in eastern Ukraine currently controlled by Kyiv. The plan has since been revised to better reflect Ukraine's interests and the views of European allies. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he was ready to meet Trump to discuss outstanding \"sensitive points\".In the leaked audio recording obtained and shared as a transcript by Bloomberg, Witkoff appeared to advise Yuri Ushakov, Putin's foreign policy adviser, on how to get on Trump's good side.BBC News has not independently verified the reported 14 October call, but Trump said it represented a \"very standard form of negotiations\". During the leaked conversation, the two men reportedly talked about ending the war, with Ushakov asking if it would be useful to get their bosses - Putin and Trump - to speak.Witkoff is quoted as saying that \"my guy is ready to do it\", before suggesting how to go about the call.\"Just reiterate that you congratulate the president [Trump] on this achievement... that you respect that he is a man of peace and you're just, you're really glad to have seen it happen,\" Witkoff is quoted as saying. \"I think from that it's going to be a really good call.\"\"I told the president that you - that the Russian Federation has always wanted a peace deal. That's my belief,\" Witkoff adds, according to the transcript. \"The issue is is that we have two nations that are having a hard time coming to a compromise.\"He continues: \"I'm even thinking that maybe we set out like a 20-point peace proposal, just like we did in Gaza.\"The call ends with Witkoff telling Ushakov of an imminent Zelensky visit to the White House, and that \"if possible\", Trump and Putin should talk before that meeting.What followed was a two-and-a-half hour phone call between the US and Russian presidents, news of which emerged as Zelensky was on his way to Washington last month.Before the Trump-Putin call, the US president had appeared to be running out of patience with his Russian counterpart and had suggested he might provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles.By the time Zelensky entered the White House, the atmosphere seemed to have changed. Trump said giving Kyiv Tomahawks could escalate the conflict and that he believed Putin \"wants to end the war\".Asked about the call being leaked, Yuri Ushakov told Russian state media that it was done to \"hinder, probably\" and that it was \"unlikely\" to be done to improve relations.He also confirmed that Witkoff would be visiting Moscow next week as per a \"preliminary agreement\".It was not clear who was behind the leak, but Bloomberg has also transcribed another reported call between Ushakov and Putin envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who spent days with Witkoff in Miami in late October weeks before the 28-point draft plan emerged.According to that transcript, Dmitriev tells his Russian colleague: \"We'll just make this paper from our position, and I'll informally pass it along, making it clear that it's all informal. And let them do like their own.\"Apparently angered by the report, Dmitriev complained of a \"well-funded, well-organised malicious media machine built to spread fake narratives, smear opponents and keep people confused\".",

    "body": "Pope Leo on first foreign trip says future of humanity at stake from conflict1 hour agoAleem MaqboolReligion editor, travelling with Pope Leo XIVAnadolu via Getty ImagesPope Leo (C) was welcomed to Ankara by Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip ErdoganPope Leo XIV has warned that the world should not give into \"a heightened level of conflict on the global level\", at the start of his foreign trip in Turkey.\"The future of humanity is at stake, said the Pope, urging President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to act as a source of stability because of the need to promote dialogue and stability.The Pope will mark a historic Christian anniversary during his visit to Turkey, before heading to Lebanon days after Israeli airstrikes on its capital, Beirut.The visits had been planned by late Pope Francis, but their main theme of building bridges was embraced by Pope Leo from the moment he stepped on the balcony of St Peter's Basilica after his election in May.Leo warned that today's wars were like a \"third world war fought piecemeal\", repeating a phrase that his predecessor had himself used several times, referring to conflicts in Ukraine, Syria, Myanmar and elsewhere. Since he became pontiff six months ago, he has conveyed a sense of being extremely measured, even cautious. But on this trip, his powers of diplomacy will be closely scrutinised.A key moment of the trip will take place in the Turkish town of Iznik, the site of the ancient city of Nicaea. Pope Leo and leaders of other Christian traditions will gather to mark the anniversary of an ancient council that took place there 1,700 years ago.  In 325 AD, among other key decisions, more than 200 bishops at the council affirmed the belief that Jesus was the son of God, eventually leading to what is known as the Nicene Creed.Eastern and Western branches of Christianity later dramatically split, but during this trip there will be messages of togetherness and healing divisions.In Turkey the Pope will also visit the Blue Mosque, as both his immediate predecessors Pope Francis and Pope Benedict XVI had done. He will have meetings with other religious leaders in a gesture of inter-religious dialogue before flying on to the second leg of the trip.EPAThe Pope plans to visit the Blue Mosque in IstanbulThe Vatican says plans for the Pope's visit to Lebanon have not changed following the Israeli airstrikes on Beirut earlier in the week.He will meet more faith leaders and hear from young people in Lebanon, his visit giving a boost in particular to the estimated third of the country that is Christian.On the final day of the trip, Pope Leo will celebrate Mass at the Beirut waterfront at the site of the 2020 port explosion, praying for the more than 200 people who were killed and 7,000 others injured.Over recent months, though he has spoken out on some issues dear to him such as the dignity of migrants, he has certainly not been as overtly political as his predecessor could be.He has walked such a fine line that in some cases both progressives and traditionalists within the Catholic Church have made the case that he supports their school of thought.It was for similar reasons that cardinals of different persuasions were thought to have coalesced around him at conclave.Pope Francis was seen as a visionary but one who was not overly worried about creating consensus, leaving behind a somewhat divided Church. Pope Leo has so far operated very differently, gently holding on to some of the progressive ideals of his predecessor while paying heed to the views of traditionalists.He has repeatedly called for an end to war, but in a different way to Pope Francis, who memorably made daily calls to the Holy Family Church in Gaza to offer his support.ReutersThe Pope met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the Presidential Palace in Ankara on ThursdayIn meetings on this trip - with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Lebanese civic leaders - Pope Leo may be drawn to comment on his views on conflict in the region.We may hear something of his impressions at the end of his trip, as it is customary for the Pope to hold a news conference with travelling press on the return flight to Rome.What we will hear more of this trip is a pope speaking in a Chicagoan accent. Although Pope Leo, who speaks several languages fluently, has mainly given public addresses in Italian up to this point, the Vatican has confirmed that he will speak English throughout the Turkish leg of his trip, with some French too during his time in Lebanon.",

    "body": "France to bring in form of military service, 25 years after conscription was phased out4 hours agoHugh SchofieldIn ParisShutterstockPresident Macron said the new form of voluntary service was an \"act of trust in our youth\"A limited form of military service will be re-introduced in France in response to growing fears of a confrontation with Russia.More than 25 years after conscription was phased out, the plan will see young men and women volunteering for a paid 10 months of military training.\"The only way to avoid danger is to prepare for it,\" President Emmanuel Macron said while announcing the plan at an infantry base near Grenoble in south-east France. \"We need to mobilise, mobilising the nation to defend itself, to be ready and remain respected.\" The new \"national service\" will be brought in gradually from next summer, mainly for 18- and 19-year-olds, who will receive at least €800 (£700) a month.\"In this uncertain world where might triumphs over right, war is in the present tense,\" said Macron. The armed forces would benefit from motivated young French men and women, he added: \"It is an act of trust in our youth.\"Initially, numbers will be restricted to 3,000 next year, but this should rise to 50,000 by 2035.France currently has around 200,000 military personnel and a further 47,000 reservists. The new scheme should usher in a three-tier structure, comprising professionals, reservists and volunteers.The change brings France in line with other European countries that have launched military service schemes - with varying parameters - because of fears of Russian aggression.Belgium and the Netherlands have introduced a voluntary military service, and Germany is planning something similar.Only this month, the Belgian defence ministry sent letters to 17-year-olds inviting them to volunteer for about €2,000 (£1,750) a month.Further east, Lithuania and Latvia have compulsory schemes, with cadets chosen by lottery. Sweden, which recently joined Nato, has started a nine- to 15-month military service with selection on merit.Some European countries, like Finland and Greece, have never stopped military service, while the Swiss are to vote on Sunday on replacing mandatory service for men with compulsory civic duty for all.Others countries, including the UK and Spain, currently have no plans to re-introduce it.AFP via Getty ImagesFrance began phasing out conscription in the late 1990sFrench military chiefs are broadly in favour of the new measure, which they hope will create a reservoir of trained personnel able to back up professional soldiers and replace them in non-frontline tasks.  It is also hoped many volunteers will stay on to lead full military careers.\"The new military service moves us in the direction of hybridisation of the armed forces,\" Thomas Gassilloud, president of the National Assembly's defence committee, said. \"We went too far in the direction of the all-professional.\"The threat of a looming, if ill-defined, stand-off with Russia has become part of France's national discourse. The government has regularly raised the alert over below-the-radar incidents or attempts by Moscow to poison opinion via social media.Recently, the newly appointed chief-of-staff, Gen Fabien Mandon, took the alarm to a new level when he said French military planning was built around the assumption of a confrontation with Russia in the next three or four years.ReutersGen Fabien Mandon prompted an outcry when he said French opinion had to be prepared for \"losing children\" at warHe went further last week, telling a gathering of mayors that what France lacked was the spirit of sacrifice, urging them to prepare opinion for the possibility of \"losing children\" in war.Immediately condemned by the far-left and part of the far-right, the remarks were also seen as unhelpful by the government, with Macron reassuring the country last weekend that there were no plans to send young recruits to fight in Ukraine.Polls show a large majority of the public in favour of voluntary military service. An Elabe survey this week found that 73% supported the measure. Young people – aged 25-34 – were the least supportive, but even in this age group there was a 60% majority.In a random BBC test of opinion on Paris streets, a similar picture emerged.\"It's a good thing,\" said Louis, a 22-year-old student. \"It can help make the army bigger, but it's also a way to love your nation more.\"Eilan, another student, said: \"In military service you meet people from everywhere. You learn new ways of seeing things... You learn to talk and trust and co-exist with other people.\"\"From what I read in the newspapers, our army is not that powerful - so if we have to prepare for the future, maybe it's a good idea,\" said set-designer Brigitte.But Lalie, a 21-year-old shop assistant, disagreed: \"I think there are more important issues. It's a pity the president is not really interested in young people – their mental health, their financial situation, and instead is focusing on this military service.\"It was in 1996 that then-President Jacques Chirac took the decision to end military service, as part of the peace dividend from the fall of the Soviet Union.Compulsory military training for young men had been part of national life since the French Revolution, which created the idea of the citizen-soldier.A 1798 law setting up conscription read: \"Every Frenchman is a soldier and is bound to the defence of the homeland.\" And after defeat by Prussia in 1871, Republican leader Léon Gambetta said: \"When in France a citizen is born, he is born a soldier.\"The Algerian war of independence was the last conflict fought by French conscripts, with more than 12,000 killed.By the 1990s, service had been reduced to 10 months, with options for civilian work instead.Since the last conscript passed out in 2001 there have been various, nebulous attempts to retain something of the spirit of military service, which proponents said fostered a sense of cohesion and equality.Lycée (high-school) students still have to attend a Day of Defence and Citizenship, where they are given lectures on rights and duties, and attend a flag-raising ceremony.In his first term, Macron also established a Universal National Service – a four-week course in civic responsibilities and practical training – which was supposed to build national solidarity following the terrorist attacks of the 2010s. But the scheme was panned as an expensive and ill-attended form of holiday camp, and was dropped earlier this year.Though this new scheme appears to enjoy a broadly favourable reception, there are still questions over its funding – with a debt crisis looming over the country and parliament still unable to approve a 2026 budget.",

    "body": "16 hours agoMatías Zibell GarcíaBusiness reporter, Añelo, ArgentinaMatías Zibell GarcíaThe Argentine town of Añelo has a bull statue that symbolises the region's economic potentialMechanic Fabio Javier Jiménez found himself in the right place at the right time.When his father moved their family-owned tyre repair shop to the rural Argentine town of Añelo, it was a small, sleepy place, some 1,000km (600 miles) southwest of Buenos Aires.There was no mains water or gas, and the electricity supply was constantly being cut off.Then in 2014, fracking for oil and gas started in the surrounding region, and the conurbation boomed.\"We set up the tyre repair shop in the middle of the sand dunes, far from the town centre,\" says Mr Jiménez. \"Then the town grew and passed us by.\"Fuelled by its new-found energy wealth, Añelo's population soared from 10,788 in 2010 to 17,893 in 2022, an increase of more than 60%. In addition, Añelo sees some 15,000 workers enter the town each week day.This has made the roads very busy, including lots of oil tankers going through.Last year, 24,956 vehicles entered the town every day, of which 6,400 were lorries, official figures showed. Mr Jiménez's workshop on the main provincial road is there to help any that need new tyres.Añelo is located in the heart of Vaca Muerta, a 30,000 sq km (12,000 sq mi) oil and gas-rich geological formation. It was first discovered as far back as 1931, but it wasn't until fracking became legal in Argentina in 2014 that the deposits could be commercially accessed.Fracking is a method of mining that first became widespread in the US in the early 2000s, whereby a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals is injected into the ground. This cracks or fractures the rock, allowing the gas or oil trapped inside to be brought to the surface.Matías Zibell GarcíaBusiness has boomed for mechanic Fabio Javier JiménezThe first fracking operation in Vaca Muerta was a joint operation between Argentina's majority state-owned oil firm Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF) and US giant Chevron.By February of this year, there were 3,358 wells in active production in Vaca Muerta, according to the Argentine Institute of Oil and Gas. Of these, 1,632 are oil, and 1,726 are gas.This accounts \"for more than half of Argentina's oil and gas production\", says Nicolás Gadano, chief economist at the Empiria consultancy and a former YPF official.He adds that the cost of the fracked oil is cheaper than conventional extraction elsewhere in Argentina, because the latter now comprises very old deposits where the remaining oil is hard to get to.Nicolás Gandini, director of Econojournal, a media outlet specialising in energy, agrees. \"We have not been able to find new conventional deposits that are very cost-competitive, with the exception of conventional gas deposits in the offshore southern basin,\" he says. \"All other onshore deposits are three to four times more expensive than Vaca Muerta.\"Añelo's size and population has soared over the past decadeThe oil and gas from Vaca Muerta has given Argentina energy self-sufficiency, overturning decades of shortages and the need for expensive imports. It has also allowed Argentina to export oil and gas, helping it to earn foreign currency.\"Last year, there was a significant external surplus in the energy sector of $6bn [£4.6bn],\" says Mr Gadano. \"This year, we are aiming for a similar figure, with much higher volume but lower prices due to the drop in international prices.\"Mr Gandini adds that the fact Argentina is now exporting more energy than it imports \"is very important\" for the country, \"especially when two or three years ago we were in the red\". Yet he adds that it won't be \"the panacea\" that cures an Argentine economy that has long battled high inflation and public spending, and defaulting on its national debt.\"I think there is an overrepresentation of the value that Vaca Muerta can bring to solving the structural problems facing the Argentine economy,\" he says.\"However, if one looks at what Argentina has today to generate more dollars, it does not have many sectors other than Vaca Muerta. It has agriculture, but agriculture also has its problems: the country has not been able to expand its agricultural production base. Beyond agriculture, mining lags far behind.\"Other commentators argue that oil and gas extraction from Vaca Muerta is being held back from reaching its full potential because Argentina's bad credit rating is putting off international investors.They also point to strict limits on how many pesos that firms can exchange into foreign currencies. This has long been the case to curb the flight of capital out of the country, and to protect the reserves of the Argentina central bank.\"Companies say 'everything is fine with Vaca Muerta, but I haven't been able to get a single dollar out of Argentina for 15 years, so we make money but we have to reinvest it there by force',\" explains Mr Gadano. \"That's not how the world works, that's not how companies work, especially the big international players.\"The government of President Javier Milei lifted foreign exchange controls for individuals last April, and following his party's victory in mid-term elections last month, it is expected that restrictions on companies may soon also be lifted.Other critics say that Vaca Muerta is being hampered by insufficient pipelines, poor roads and the lack of a railway connection.Gustavo Medele is energy minister of Neuquén Province, where the town of Añelo and much of Vaca Muerta is found. He says that the provincial government \"is doing what it has to do and what it can do\".What continues to help Vaca Muerta is that it has achieved a political consensus – all main parties support increased mining. \"All the relevant political forces agree that this is an industry that needs to grow,\" notes Mr Gadano.Roads in and around Añelo are now busy with trafficThis consensus has become a problem for those who, since the start of fracking at Vaca Muerta, have voiced their environmental concerns.\"We are really losing in the public debate,\" says Fernando Cabrera, director of environmental pressure group Observatorio Petrolero Sur. \"There is a very noticeable difference in the capacity for public and media influence; provincial legislatures are largely in favour of exploitation, as are the national chambers, so it is a very uneven dynamic.\"Back at Mr Jiménez's garage, business is so good that he has opened a second branch. \"When we came to Añelo, we were happy to service two vehicles a day. Then we serviced 10 vehicles, and now we have 20 vehicles a day.\"Yet he is sceptical that oil and gas exploitation will be the solution to all the country's problems. \"Yes there will surely be oil and gas for many years to come, but that does not mean that Argentina will not continue to experience economic and political ups and downs.\"Read more global business stories",

    "body": "US transportation secretary wants more civility in air travel. Not everyone is on boardUS Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is urging air travellers to dress better and be more civil - and it's touching a nerve at a time when many Americans consider air travel more frustrating than ever. Ahead of what's expected to be the busiest Thanksgiving travel season in 15 years, Duffy launched a campaign last week titled \"The Golden Age of Travel Starts with You\", in which he harked back to the 1950s and 60s to call for a return to civility and class in air travel. But as air traffic controllers remain short-staffed and customers face frequent flight delays, both social media users and aviation experts say Duffy is missing the point. A video advert for the Department of Transportation's campaign juxtaposes old footage of smiling airport staff and orderly passengers with modern social media videos of people starting fights on planes, putting their bare feet up on seats and engaging in other disruptive behaviour. \"Manners don't stop at the gate. Things aren't what they used to be,\" Duffy chimes in. \"Let's bring civility and manners back. Ask yourself, are you helping a pregnant woman put her bag in the overhead bin? Are you dressing with respect?\"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) predicts this week will be the busiest Thanksgiving travel season in 15 years - with more than 52,000 flights on 25 November alone. And aviation experts say Duffy's message won't have much effect on the flying atmosphere. Scott Keyes, an air travel expert and founder of the flight deals site Going.com, told the BBC that, while it sounds great to ask everyone to just be nicer to each other, in terms of the actual efficacy of that message, \"you might as well ask a wall to start printing you money\". \"Very few people show up for their flight itching to pick a fight with another passenger,\" Mr Keyes said. And once they reach the level of agitation where they've started picking a fight with a flight attendant or passenger, he said they're unlikely to remember Duffy's words or calm down. The underlying problem, he argues, is people letting their tempers get the best of them, which he sees as a worsening problem across all of society, not just on airplanes, and not just in the US. Since the secretary started posting about the campaign on X, some of his subsequent posts have been flooded with thousands of comments critical of Duffy's message.\"If you want us to be respectful humans at the airport stop treating us like cattle,\" one X user commented. \"Remove the demoralising and humiliating TSA checks (that accomplish nothing) and find a way to get the airlines to give more than 2 inches of space per seat.\"Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and president of Atmosphere Research Group, told the BBC that, while Duffy makes a valid point that being considerate was important, his call to dress nicer won't change a thing. \"You could be dressed in black tie and still be a jerk, and you could be wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt and be the most considerate person in the world. The clothes, in this case, do not make the person,\" Mr Harteveldt said. A number of commenters on Duffy's X post have pointed out that the reason they dress so casually is because of how cramped plane cabins have become, as well as the expectation of extended delays. \"Tell you what,\" one X user commented. \"You get the planes running on time, and we won't dress to spend the night in the damn airport.\" Another wrote: \"Can I get my legroom back?\"One X user, who has nearly 500,000 followers, posted: \"Duffy is absolutely right...BUT our declining travel dress is also a reflection of how airlines treat us. Cattle boarding, tiny seats, penny pinching every beverage cost and just generally miserable.\" Echoing what many social media users have pointed out, Mr Harteveldt said the airlines bore some responsibility for passengers' bad behaviour, too, by making their \"economy cabins so unpleasant and so physically uncomfortable\" that they naturally put passengers in a bad mood. Couple that with minimal flight attendant staffing, minimal amenities on board, and the airlines' embrace of the pay-for-what-you-want business model, \"you don't get people smiling as they walk down the loading bridge to the plane,\" he said. Still, others have praised the secretary's core message of respect and kindness, with one commenting: \"I will do my small part to spread civility in my own life.\"The Department of Transportation (DOT) says the campaign isn't only about saying \"please\" and \"thank you\" - it's also about reducing the amount of violent and disruptive incidents on airplanes and in airports. The agency says that since 2019 there's been a 400% increase in in-flight outbursts, including both unruly behaviour and violent attacks. Since 2021, the department has recorded 13,800 unruly passenger incidents, while one in five attendants have experienced a physical incident.But experts dispute that air travel has declined in quality. Dan Bubb, an aviation historian and professor at University of Nevada Las Vegas, told the BBC that, despite the rise in incivility cases, statistically that number wasn't very significant. There are far more travellers and flights now than there used to be, and Prof Bubb said that makes it difficult to compare today's airline incidents with past decades. Mr Keyes pointed out what he sees as another major issue with Duffy's message: air travel used to bring a host of other issues we no longer face today. \"It's laughable how much worse air travel was back then,\" Mr Keyes said. Flying was far less safe, he said, noting that planes crashed and were hijacked more frequently. Flights were also far more expensive relative to income. Among other drawbacks: the cabins were filled with cigarette smoke, and flight attendants faced rampant sexism and stringent physical requirements. Mr Keyes believes the FAA and DOT could make more of a difference in reducing passenger stress by pushing airlines to minimise the number of delays and cancellations. Prof Bubb said it would also help to \"give passengers a little more physical space in terms of seat size and legroom, include meal service in the price of their tickets, reduce alcohol consumption, make going through security at airports less stressful, make parking at airports easier, expand boarding area space at airport gates\". And, he added, we do still need to encourage passengers to be courteous to flight crews and each other.",

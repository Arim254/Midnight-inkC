    "body": "An explosion has killed at least eight people and injured 18 others during Friday prayers inside a mosque in the Syrian city of Homs, the health ministry has said.Pictures from Syria's state-run news agency, Sana, show the inside of the Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib Mosque with black, scorched walls, smashed windows and blood on the carpet.Officials believe that an explosive was detonated inside the building, Sana reports, citing a security source. While authorities are still searching for the perpetrators, jihadist group Saraya Ansar al-Sunnah said it was behind the explosion.The mosque is in the Wadi al-Dhahab neighbourhood, where most people are part of the Alawite ethnoreligious group. Syria's Foreign Ministry condemned the \"terrorist crime\", writing in a statement on X that the \"cowardly act is a blatant assault on human and moral values\" designed to \"undermine the security and stability\" of the country.Saraya Ansar al-Sunnah, a Sunni extremist group, has said it carried out the attack in collaboration with another unidentified group, using explosives planted at the site.The group's vague origins and opaque affiliations, which came to prominence in June when it said it was behind a deadly church bombing in Damascus, have raised questions about its true links and authenticity. Some observers have speculated that it could be a front for Islamic State group (IS) given the similarity in their messaging and type of targets.The latest claim follows a months-long lull in Saraya Ansar al-Sunnah's claimed attacks, which have largely taken the form of alleged targeted killings of minorities and what the group describes as \"remnants\" of the former Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad.The blast comes a year after Syrian rebel forces overthrew Assad, who is Alawite. The sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam whose members make up one of the country's biggest religious minorities.Since then, Syria has seen several waves of sectarian violence, with Alawites fearing reprisals and being subject to crackdowns. Assad fled to Russia, an ally of his regime, where he and his family have been given asylum.In March, security forces were accused of killing dozens of Alawites in the coastal province of Latakia, war monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring ",

    "body": "Turkish authorities say they have disrupted planned attacks on Christmas and New Year's events after detaining more than 100 suspected members of the so-called Islamic State group.Mass raids were carried out at 124 addresses across Istanbul, the city's chief prosecutor said, with firearms, ammunition and \"organisational documents\" seized.Officials said IS supporters had been actively planning attacks across Turkey this week, particularly against non-Muslims. Police detained 115 suspects but efforts are ongoing to trace a further 22, an official statement read.The prosecutor's office said the suspects were in contact with IS operatives outside Turkey. The announcement comes two days after Turkish intelligence agents carried out a raid against the group on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.A Turkish national who is alleged to have held a senior role with the IS wing operating in the region was detained and accused of planning attacks against civilians. Turkey's security services regularly target people with suspected links to IS.The country shares a 900km (560 mile) border with Syria, where the group continues to operate in parts of the country.Syria's president Ahmed al-Sharaa, who has close ties to the Turkish government, has vowed to work with the US and Europe to root out surviving elements of IS. The US launched a wave of air strikes against the group's positions across Syria on Friday in response to the killing of three Americans.Two US soldiers and a civilian interpreter were killed by IS gunmen during an ambush earlier this month.

    "body": "Thailand carried out air strikes on a disputed border area with Cambodia on Friday, as officials from both sides continued talks to try to end fighting.The Thai Air Force said it had hit a Cambodian \"fortified military position\" after civilians had left the area. Cambodia's defence ministry accused Thailand of \"indiscriminate attacks\" against civilian houses and injuring several people.Fighting broke out again earlier this month after a fragile ceasefire in July halted five days of intense border clashes. At least 41 people have been killed and almost one million displaced since the hostilities resumed.Both countries have blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce.Since then, fighting has spread to nearly every province along the 500-mile (800km) border.Cambodia's defence ministry said Friday's attacks were in the north-western Banteay Meanchey province. Up to 40 bombs were dropped by F-16 fighter jets, the ministry said in a Facebook post.Thailand said the action was aimed at controlling Nong Chan village, and was \"carried out efficiently and successfully\".It came as Thai and Cambodian negotiators held their third day of talks at a border checkpoint. Defence ministers from both sides are due to join the discussions on Saturday.Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said on Friday that once both sides agreed to each other's conditions, a ceasefire agreement could be signed.\"I hope this time will be the last one we'd have to sign, so that peace can occur in the area,\" he said, \"[and] people can return to their homes.\"The US and China have also been attempting to mediate a new ceasefire.The dispute between Thailand and Cambodia dates back more than a century, and there have been sporadic clashes, with soldiers and civilians killed on both sides over the years.But in May, tensions ramped up after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash. And on 24 July, the situation dramatically escalated after a Cambodian rocket barrage into Thailand, which was followed by Thai air strikes. That set off five days of intense fighting, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead.",

The party he leads, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), is eyeing a return to power when Bangladesh goes to the polls in the new year.Rahman, who has lived in London since 2008, is expected to become the country's new leader if the BNP emerges as the largest party. ReutersThe BNP said they expected millions to line the streets of Dhaka to mark Rahman's returnRahman's return comes in the wake of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina being ousted last year.He had been the subject of various criminal investigations launched while her Awami League party was in power but was cleared of all charges when her regime fell. Hasina is living in exile in India and her party is unlikely to be permitted to take part in the elections, which many view as among the most consequential in Bangladesh's history.Last month, Hasina was sentenced to death for her role in suppressing anti-government protests. According to UN investigators, up to 1,400 people died in the student-led unrest.Hasina, who was put on trial in absentia, has denied committing crimes against humanity. ",

The suspect was eventually shot and wounded by a civilian outside the city of Afula, according to police.Shimshon Mordechai, a 68-year-old man, was killed and a 16-year-old boy was hurt in Friday's ramming, officials said, while the stabbing victim was Aviv Maor, aged 18.A day before the attack, an Israeli reservist was fired after video emerged of him ramming a praying Palestinian with a quad bike. The suspect in the attack came from the village of Qabatiya, in the northern occupied West Bank, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said.Following the incident, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was preparing to carry out an operation in the Qabatiya area. Katz said he had instructed the IDF to act \"forcefully and immediately\". The IDF said the suspect had \"infiltrated into Israeli territory several days ago\".Israel's Kan News public broadcaster said the 37-year-old man had been working illegally in Israel and had used his employer's vehicle in the attack.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed \"deepest condolences\" to the victims' families.In a post on X, he also praised \"the heroic citizen who neutralised the terrorist\".The incident comes a day after the army reservist drove a quad bike into a Palestinian man who was praying on a roadside in the West Bank.Video shows the man, dressed in civilian clothes but with a firearm, ramming the victim with the vehicle. Reports say the victim was unhurt. The Israeli military said the soldier - who had earlier opened fire in a nearby village - had been fired and his weapon confiscated.Attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians have surged in the West Bank in recent years, according to the United Nations, with more than a thousand killed since the Hamas attacks on Israel of 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 abducted into Gaza.More than 70,600 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Additional reporting by Tom McArthur",

    "body": "Four hikers who went missing on Christmas Day have been found dead after being buried by an avalanche in the snow-covered Vardousia Mountains in Greece.The bodies of three men and a woman were found on Friday evening after a large-scale search in the mountainous region of Fokida, according to Greek state broadcaster ERT.Fire service teams located the bodies partially covered by snow on a steep and inaccessible slope near the summit of Korakas peak, at an altitude of about 2,000m (6,561ft). Rescue officials said the group was swept away by an avalanche.Authorities said the hikers had begun their ascent in favourable weather, but conditions quickly worsened due to the altitude and the area's terrain.Vasilis Vathrakogiannis, a spokesperson for the Hellenic Fire Service, told the BBC the alarm was raised by a friend of the three men after they failed to return at the expected time.\"Weather conditions were extremely difficult, with low temperatures and poor visibility,\" he said, adding this made it hard for both drones and a helicopter to detect anything.He said a fire service ground team later found the bodies of the three men and a woman, who was confirmed to be a friend of one of them and had not been expected to take part in the climb.The Vardousia Mountains are considered one of Greece's most challenging mountaineering areas, particularly in winter, when conditions can be unforgiving even for experienced climbers.Haris Asariotakis, head of the Hellenic Rescue Team mission at the scene, said preparations were under way to recover the bodies.Authorities said rescue teams began approaching the site early on Saturday, with a helicopter requested to help transport the bodies if weather conditions allow, due to the distance from the nearest road.Additional reporting by Kostas Koukoumakas",

    "body": "Pope Leo has urged Ukraine and Russia to find the \"courage\" to hold direct talks to end the war during his first Christmas remarks to crowds in St Peter's square.He called for an end to conflicts around the world during his Urbi et Orbi address, which is traditionally delivered by the pontiff on Christmas Day to worshippers gathered in Vatican City. Speaking about Ukraine, the Pope said: \"May the clamour of weapons cease, and may the parties involved, with the support and commitment of the international community, find the courage to engage in sincere, direct and respectful dialogue.\"His plea comes as US-led negotiations on a deal to end the fighting continues. The US has sought to put together an agreement acceptable to both sides, but direct talks between Russian and Ukraine have not taken place during this latest round of diplomatic efforts.Pope Leo also decried turmoil and conflict plaguing other parts of the world, including Thailand and Cambodia where deadly border clashes have flared up despite a ceasefire in July.He asked that the South East Asian nations' \"ancient friendship\" be restored and \"to work towards reconciliation and peace\".During an earlier Christmas Day sermon in St Peter's Basilica, Pope Leo lamented conditions for homeless people the world over, and the damage caused by conflicts.\"Fragile is the flesh of defenceless populations, tried by so many wars, ongoing or concluded, leaving behind rubble and open wounds,\" he said.He said the story of the birth of Jesus showed that God had \"pitched his fragile tent\" among the people of the world. \"How, then,\" he asked, turning his attention to the conditions of Palestinians, \"can we not think of the tents in Gaza, exposed for weeks to rain, wind and cold?\"Gaza has been devastated by Israeli bombardment in a two-year war, triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.Winter storms have compounded the plight of the territory's 2.1m population, nearly all of whom have been displaced and their homes damaged or destroyed.Aid agencies have called for Israel to allow more tents and urgently needed supplies into Gaza. Cogat, the Israeli military body which controls Gaza's border crossings, has dismissed claims of deliberate aid restrictions, saying almost 310,000 tents and tarpaulins had been delivered since the start of the ceasefire in October.",

    "body": "17 hours agoMadeline HalpertEric Thayer via Getty ImagesCars were buried in debris in Wrightwood, CaliforniaRainstorms are tapering off across southern California, but even modest additional rainfall could trigger floods and mudslides in saturated areas, forecasters warn.Officials say at least three people have died in the catastrophic flooding over the Christmas period.The storms - which continued into Friday - brought 6 inches (15 cm) of rainfall to Los Angeles County, with up to 18 inches recorded in the mountains, prompting evacuations and closing major roads.More than 50,000 people in the state are still without power as efforts to restore service continue on Friday.The US National Weather Service warned  on Friday  that \"the potential for flooding will be high\", though showers will taper off as the day goes on.\"Flood watches and advisories remain in effect as it won't take much additional rain to create flooding issues today, especially in the mountains where some areas have received close to 18 inches of rain since Tuesday,\" the NWS said in its latest forecast.The storms came from multiple atmospheric rivers - invisible ribbons of water vapour that form over oceans and transport huge amounts of moisture, bringing intense rainfall and snow - during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year.Emergency responders have had to perform several rescues, including people stuck in vehicles as flood waters rose. On Wednesday morning, a 64-year-old man from San Diego was killed by a fallen tree, the police department told US media.Another person, a 74-year-old, died from flood waters over the weekend as police tried to rescue him from inside a vehicle in Redding, the town's mayor told local news.Watch: Powerful storm batters southern CaliforniaAnd on Monday, a woman in her 70s died after she \"was knocked off a rock by a large wave and swept into the ocean\" at MacKerricher State Park in Mendocino County, the sheriff's office said.In a statement on Thursday night, Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles said that a limited number of evacuation orders remained in effect.Friday's rain is expected to be lighter and briefer than the earlier waves, with improving conditions anticipated by the evening,\"Our overall picture is that there's just one more day of this mess, mostly across Southern California, specifically in the LA area,\" Tom Kines, a senior meteorologist with AccuWeather, told Reuters on Friday. \"We still have some issues today with bouts of heavy rain, but this weekend is mainly dry, thankfully.\"Heavy rain threatens US west coast",

    "body": "The jailed ex-president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, has undergone a successful surgery for a double hernia, his wife Michelle says. The former leader is serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup after he lost the 2022 presidential election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Brazil's Supreme Court granted permission for the 70-year-old to be transferred from the room in the federal police headquarters where he is serving his sentence to a hospital in the capital, Brasília, for the procedure. Ahead of the surgery, Jair Bolsonaro endorsed the candidacy of his eldest son, Flávio, for the 2026 presidential race. The former president made his decision known in handwritten letter that was read out by Flávio Bolsonaro outside the hospital were his father is being treated.\"During my life, I have fought tough battles, paying a high price with both my health and my family, to defend what I think is best for our country,\" Bolsonaro wrote.\"I hand over what is most important in the life of a father - my own son for the mission of rescuing our country, Brazil.\"Flávio Bolsonaro, a 44-year-old senator, had already announced his decision to run for president for his father's Liberal Party.Ealier this month, he said his father had entrusted him \"with the mission of continuing our national project\". But Jair Bolsonaro's letter, which has been published by Brazilian media, is confirmation the senator has his father's backing.The incumbent, President Lula, has already announced he plans to run again in the presidential election scheduled for October 2026. In 2022, the presidential election went into a run-off, which saw the older Bolsonaro take on ex-President Lula. When Lula narrowly won, Jair Bolsonaro refused to accept the result and plotted with top military leaders to prevent Lula from taking up office. While the plot failed to enlist enough support from the military to go ahead, it did culminate in the storming of government buildings by Bolsonaro's supporters on 8 January 2023.Bolsonaro was found guilty of coup-plotting and sentenced in September this year. Despite the guilty verdict, the older Bolsonaro still wields considerable political influence.Brazil's Congress passed a bill last week to significantly shorten Bolsonaro's sentence but President Lula said he would veto it.  Jair Bolsonaro is expected to be transferred back to federal police headquarters as soon as doctors give the go-ahead. ",

    "body": "18 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterA US judge has temporarily blocked the detention of British social media campaigner Imran Ahmed, who took legal action against the US government over having his visa removed.The Center for Countering Digital Hate founder was among five people denied US visas after the Trump administration accused them of seeking to \"coerce\" tech platforms into censoring free speech.The move brought a backlash from European leaders defending the work of organisations monitoring online content.Mr Ahmed, a US permanent resident, had warned that being detained and possibly deported would tear him away from his American wife and child. Praising the judge's decision, he told BBC News he would not be \"bullied\".Secretary of State Marco Rubio had said online that the individuals were blocked over concerns that they had organised efforts to pressure US platforms to censor and \"punish American viewpoints they oppose\".Mr Ahmed filed a legal complaint on Wednesday against officials including Rubio and US Attorney General Pamela Bondi over the decision to have him sanctioned.In court documents seen by the BBC, US District Judge Vernon S Broderick said on Thursday he had granted Mr Ahmed's request for a temporary restraining order.The judge also temporarily blocked the officials from detaining Mr Ahmed without the chance for his case to be heard.The BBC has contacted the state department and White House for comment.When approached by AFP news agency, a state department spokesperson was quoted as saying: \"The Supreme Court and Congress have repeatedly made clear: the United States is under no obligation to allow foreign aliens to come to our country or reside here.\"Mr Ahmed said: \"I will not be bullied away from my life's work of fighting to keep children safe from social media's harm and stopping antisemitism online.\"His lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, said the speed of the judge's decision was telling. \"The federal government can't deport a green card holder like Imran Ahmed, with a wife and young child who are American, simply because it doesn't like what he has to say,\" she said.In 2023, Mr Ahmed's centre was sued by Elon Musk's social media company after it reported on a rise in hate speech on the platform since the billionaire's takeover of the firm, now called X.The case was dismissed but an appeal is pending. Speaking to the BBC News Channel on Friday evening, Mr Ahmed said: \"We were sued by Elon Musk a couple of years ago, unsuccessfully; a court found that he was trying to impinge on our First Amendment rights to free speech by using law to try and silence our accountability work.\"Mr Ahmed said the last few days have been \"rather confusing\". He said the Center for Countering Digital Hate \"has worked with administrations both Republican and Democrat\" and feels he is now being targeted because the organisations his group researches do not like being called out.\"This does seem to be...  perhaps even an error, goaded on by some of the tech companies, the social media platforms, the AI platforms that the Center for Countering Digital Hate studies and holds accountable\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondentandTabby WilsonThailand and Cambodia have agreed to an immediate ceasefire, the defence ministers of both countries have said in a joint statement.The two sides have agreed to freeze the front lines where they are now and allow civilians living in border areas to return home, halting almost three weeks of intense clashes in which dozens of people have been killed and nearly one million displaced.The ceasefire took effect at noon local time (05:00 GMT) on Saturday. Once it has been in place for 72 hours, 18 Cambodian soldiers held by Thailand since July will be released, the statement said.The breakthrough came after days of talks between the two countries, with diplomatic encouragement from China and the US.The agreement prioritises getting the displaced back to their homes, and also includes an agreement to remove landmines.Thailand's Defence Minister Natthaphon Narkphanit described the ceasefire as a test for the \"other party's sincerity\".\"Should the ceasefire fail to materialise or be violated, Thailand retains its legitimate right to self-defence under international law,\" he told reporters.Thailand had been reluctant to accept the ceasefire, saying the last one was not properly implemented. They also resented what they saw as Cambodia's efforts to internationalise the conflict.Unlike the last ceasefire in July, US President Donald Trump was conspicuously absent from this one, although the US State Department was involved.That ceasefire agreement collapsed earlier this month, when fresh clashes erupted. Both sides blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce.The Thai army said its troops had responded to Cambodian fire in Thailand's Si Sa Ket province, in which two Thai soldiers were injured.Cambodia's defence ministry said it was Thai forces that had attacked first, in Preah Vihear province, and insisted that Cambodia did not retaliate.Clashes have continued throughout December. On Friday, Thailand carried out more air strikes inside Cambodia.The Thai Air Force said it had hit a Cambodian \"fortified military position\" after civilians had left the area. Cambodia's defence ministry said the strikes were \"indiscriminate attacks\" against civilian houses.How well the ceasefire holds this time depends to a large extent on political will. Nationalist sentiment has been inflamed in both countries.Cambodia, in particular, has lost many soldiers and a lot of its military equipment. It has been driven back from positions it held on the border, and suffered extensive damage from the Thai air strikes, grievances which could make a lasting peace harder to achieve.Disagreement over the border dates back more than a century, but tension increased early this year after a group of Cambodian women sang patriotic songs in a disputed temple.A Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash in May, and two months later, in July, there were five days of intense fighting along the border, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead. Thousands more civilians were displaced.Following intervention by Malaysia and President Trump, a fragile ceasefire was negotiated between the two countries, and signed in late October.Trump dubbed the agreement the \"Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords\". It mandated both sides to withdraw their heavy weapons from the disputed region, and to establish an interim observer team to monitor it.However, the agreement was suspended by Thailand in November after Thai soldiers were injured by landmines, with Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul announcing that the security threat had \"not actually decreased\".",

    "body": "Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has been jailed for 15 years for abuse of power and money laundering, in his second major trial for a multi-billion-dollar state funds scandal.Najib, 72, was accused of misappropriating nearly 2.3 billion Malaysian ringgit ($569m; £422m) from the nation's sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).On Friday afternoon a judge found him guilty in four charges of abuse of power and  21 charges of money laundering. The former PM is already in jail after he was convicted years ago in another case related to 1MDB.Friday's verdict comes after seven years of legal proceedings, which saw 76 witnesses called to the stand.The verdict, delivered in Malaysia's administrative capital Putrajaya, is the second blow in the same week to the embattled former leader, who has been imprisoned since 2022.He was handed four 15-year sentences on abuse of power charges, as well as five years each on 21 money laundering charges. The jail terms run concurrently under Malaysian law. On Monday, the court rejected his application to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. But the former prime minister retains a loyal base of supporters, who claim that he's a victim of unfair rulings and who have showed up at his trials calling for his release.On Friday, dozens of people gathered outside the court in Putrajaya in support of Najib.The 1MDB scandal made headlines across the world when it came to light a decade ago, embroiling prominent figures from Malaysia to Goldman Sachs and Hollywood.Investigators estimated that $4.5bn was siphoned from the state-owned wealth fund into private pockets, including Najib's.Najib's lawyers claim that he had been misled by his advisers - in particular the financier Jho Low, who has maintained his innocence but remains at large.But the argument has not convinced Malaysia's courts, which previously found Najib guilty of embezzlement in 2020.That year, Najib was convicted of abuse of power, money laundering and breach of trust over 42 million ringgit ($10m; £7.7m) transferred from SRC International - a former unit of 1MDB - into his private accounts.He was sentenced to 12 years in prison, but saw his jail term halved last year.The latest case concerns a larger sum of money, also tied to 1MDB, received by his personal bank account in 2013. Najib said he had believed the money was a donation from the late Saudi King Abdullah - a claim rejected by the judge on Friday.Separately Najib's wife, Rosmah Mansor, was sentenced to ten years in jail in 2022 for bribery. She is free on bail pending an appeal against her conviction.The scandal has had profound repercussions on Malaysian politics. In 2018 it led to a historic election loss for Najib's Barisan Nasional coalition, which had governed the country since its independence in 1957.Now, the recent verdicts has highlighted fissures in Malaysia's ruling coalition, which includes Najib's party United Malays National Organisation (UMNO).Najib's failed house arrest bid on Monday was met with disappointment from his allies but celebrated by his critics within the same coalition.Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim called for politicians on all sides to respect the court's decisions.Former Malaysian lawmaker Tony Pua told the BBC's Newsday programme that the verdict would \"send a message\" to the country's leaders, that \"you can get caught for corruption even if you're number one in the country like the prime minister\".But Cynthia Gabriel,  founding director of Malaysia's Center to Combat Corruption and Cronyism, argued that the country has made little headway in anti-corruption efforts despite the years of reckoning after the 1MDB scandal.Public institutions have not been strengthened enough to reassure Malaysians that \"the politicians they put into power would actually serve their interests\" instead of \"their own pockets\", she told Newsday.\"Grand corruption continues in different forms\", she added. \"We don't know at all if another 1MDB could occur, or may have already occurred.\"",

    "body": "One general, one mathematician: The men competing for power in two African elections11 hours agoPaul MellyWest Africa analystAFP via Getty ImagesVoters in Guinea and the Central African Republic will get to vote for president On Sunday, citizens of Guinea and the Central African Republic (CAR) will go to the polls to elect their presidents for terms of office of seven years.Both contests could, in theory, go on to run-off ballots. Yet in both, the incumbents are strong favourites, with observers predicting they will clinch victory outright in the first round with more than 50% of the vote.But that's where the similarities end.The CAR, vast and landlocked, is one of Africa's poorest countries, marred by chronic instability for decades, with a succession of armed groups motivated by a variety of local grievances, opportunities for racketeering or political ambitions.From 2013 to 2016 it was only the intervention of African, French and then UN peacekeepers that averted a slide into deeper inter-communal violence.The national government in Bangui, the riverside capital on the southern border, just across the water from the Democratic Republic of Congo, has often struggled to assert its authority in the distant outer-lying regions of the north or far east.Despite these enduring fragilities, multi-party politics has mostly survived, with a fair degree of tolerance for opposition and protest.There is a sense of national identity and this year has seen two of the most significant rebel groups drawn back into the peace process and starting to disarm and demobilise.The country has a pioneering special court for trying human-rights crimes, staffed with a blend of national and international judges.AFP via Getty ImagesPresident Faustin-Archange Touadéra is hoping for a third term in officePresident Faustin-Archange Touadéra is a mathematician and former university vice-chancellor. He entered politics as prime minister under the putschist-turned elected head of state, François Bozizé. Later, after a chaotic interlude of rebel rule and an uncertain transition, he was elected head of state as a post-conflict and consensual civil-society figure.Today, approaching the end of his second term, Touadéra is seen as a far more political and partisan figure. He bulldozed through constitutional reform to scrap term limits, allowing him to stand again. This has provoked a boycott by much, though not all, of the opposition.Yet, contrary to widespread expectations, his most prominent electoral rival, Anicet-Georges Dologuélé, has been allowed to take part in the electoral race.This contrasts with the situation in Guinea, on Africa's west coast, where Gen Mamadi Doumbouya, leader of the September 2021 coup that deposed the 83-year old civilian President Alpha Condé, is now preparing to convert himself into a constitutionally elected ruler.Although Doumbouya will face eight challengers at the ballot box, he has dominated the campaign, with his image plastered all over the streets of Conakry, Guinea's capital city. The most prominent opposition figure of the past 10 years, Cellou Dalein Diallo, with a big personal following among the large Peul community who account for about 40% of the electorate, has been excluded from the contest.Despite these constraints on the political choice presented to voters, the return of an elected government will come as a great relief to the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), a regional bloc that promotes economic integration, democracy, and military cooperation among its members.Almost a year ago, it suffered a blow with the withdrawal of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger after the military regimes that had seized power in a wave of coups between 2020 and 2023 refused to comply with the bloc's demands to commit to clear timeframes for the restoration of civilian rule.AFP via Getty ImagesFrom 2021 (L) to today (R) - Mamadi Doumbouya now wants to be a civilian presidentDoumbouya made a different choice.Although he kept good relations with the junta in neighbouring Mali, he has pursued a methodical constitutional review, which has laid the ground for Sunday's vote, even if this has been delayed for longer than Ecowas originally wanted.His approach to international relations also contrasts starkly with neighbouring regimes, who have cultivated close security ties with Russia and repudiated their previous close partnerships with France.Doumbouya has maintained good relations with Western governments, particularly Paris. Officials in Conakry praise the French Development Agency as one of their most supportive partners.Indeed, from the outset, the Doumbouya regime has been treated rather gently by both France and the West generally, and by Ecowas, despite a troubling human rights record.His overthrow of Condé - who had staged a dubious constitutional referendum to allow himself the chance to stand for a third term and had overseen frequent bouts of security force brutality - was celebrated on the streets of Conakry and barely criticised abroad.AFP via Getty ImagesGen Mamadi Doumbouya has dominated the build-up to the electionDoumbouya earned international goodwill when he pressed quickly ahead with the long-delayed trial of those accused of a notorious 2009 stadium massacre when about 150 opposition supporters were killed and many women raped.And even though his own rule saw youth protesters shot, and leading civil society activists Billo Bah and Foniké Mengué detained and never heard from since, regional and international reactions were muted.West Africa has been shaken by coups and the breakaway of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger from Ecowas, as well as this month's attempted putsch in Benin. Guinea's decision to stay in the bloc and restore elected government - even if it breaches Doumbouya's earlier promise that no member of his junta would stand in the polls - has been greeted with quiet relief by many regional leaders and European governments, as a step towards reconsolidating normality.With jihadist groups now disrupting daily life and trade across the south of Mali and Burkina Faso, the gradual progress towards constitutional stability in Guinea, despite persistent civil-rights concerns, has been welcomed.The same goes for Touadéra's bid for a third term in the CAR, a country slowly emerging from years of insecurity. The UN peacekeeping force, Minusca, is helping the government to gradually restore basic administration and services, even to distant provincial towns.The CAR still significantly relies on Russian military advice, but the president has taken time to rebuild good relations with France and maintain a close partnership with the EU and the UN.With war-ravaged Sudan just over the north-eastern border, and deep fragilities still persistent at home, international partners are minded to support rather than criticise, despite the frustrations of those opponents who feel that a Touadéra third term would be illegitimate.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "3 hours agoAdam GoldsmithandTiffany WertheimerThe sound of gunfire and blasts can be heard overnight and into the morning in KyivA third of residents in Ukraine's capital Kyiv are without power after a \"massive bombing\" of residential areas and critical infrastructure by Russia overnight, Ukraine's foreign minister has said.Andrii Sybiha said residents had been left without heating in freezing winter temperatures. At least one person was killed and 28 others were injured in the strikes, Ukraine's State Emergency Service reported.The attacks happened hours before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky departed for Florida, where he will meet Donald Trump on Sunday for peace talks.Russia's ministry of defence said it had launched a \"massive retaliatory strike\" on Ukrainian energy infrastructure facilities.It said it used long-range, land-, air-, and sea-based precision weapons to target the facilities, which it claimed were being used \"in the interests of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and enterprises of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex\".Following the strikes, Zelensky repeated his claim that Russia does \"not want to end the war and is trying to use every opportunity to inflict more pain on Ukraine\".Writing on Telegram, Zelensky said Russia directed almost 500 drones and 40 missiles towards Kyiv, targeting energy and civilian infrastructure.Pictures show apartment buildings with gaping holes and homes on fire following the strikes.The apartment block of BBC journalist Anastasiya Gribanova was struck, leaving some homes on the higher levels of the high-rise building in flames. Gribanova, who was in the building's elevator at the time, was unharmed.ReutersA house in Kyiv was also hit, Ukraine's emergency services saidUkraine's State Emergency Service said that 68 people were evacuated from a retirement home in the eastern Darnytskyi district.\"Russian representatives are having long conversations, but in reality the Daggers [missiles] and Shaheds [drones] are speaking for them,\" Zelensky wrote on Telegram, saying that Vladimir Putin does not want to end the war.\"This sick activity can only be responded to with really strong steps. America has this opportunity, Europe has this opportunity, many of our partners have this opportunity,\" he wrote, urging allies to show strength against Russian aggression.The strikes saw Poland, which shares a 530km-long (320-miles) border with western Ukraine, ready its fighter jets, ground-based air defence systems and radar reconnaissance.The move was \"aimed at securing and protecting the airspace, especially in areas adjacent to the threatened regions,\" Poland's Armed Forces said. Later on Saturday morning, it concluded that there had been no violation of the country's airspace.Meanwhile, Russia's defence ministry said its air defences destroyed seven Ukrainian drones overnight.ReutersThe aftermath of the damage in KyivOn Saturday, Zelensky, EU leaders and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen are expected to hold a phone call to discuss the road to peace.Zelensky's new 20-point draft is a revised version of an earlier 28-point plan which was drafted by US special envoy Steve Witkoff, but widely seen as being too favourable to Russia.The Ukrainian president has voiced optimism around the new draft, describing it as \"a foundational document on ending the war\", but Trump warned that Zelensky \"doesn't have anything until I approve it\" in an interview with Politico.The draft reportedly includes security guarantees from the US, Nato and European allies for a co-ordinated military response if Russia were to invade Ukraine again.Control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas has been a sticking point in talks so far, but now Zelensky has said a \"free economic zone\" could be an option. Trump told Politico that he was expecting to see the new draft on Sunday.\"I think it's going to go good with him. I think it's going to go good with [Vladimir] Putin,\" Trump said in the interview, adding that he expects to speak with Russia's president \"soon\". ",

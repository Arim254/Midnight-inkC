    "body": "23 hours agoJack BurgessReutersVenezuelan opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa has announced on social media that he has been freed after \"almost nine months of unjust imprisonment\". His comments come shortly after the country's interim President, Delcy Rodríguez, signed an amnesty bill approved by its National Assembly that could lead to the release of hundreds of political prisoners. Rodríguez's interim government has faced pressure from the US to speed up the release of Venezuela's remaining political prisoners after delays to the law. However, Guanipa described the bill as a \"flawed document\" that excludes many Venezuelans who remain \"unjustly\" behind bars. Guanipa is the leader of Venezuela's centre-right Justice First party and was a former vice-president of the National Assembly.Venezuela's socialist government has always denied holding political prisoners but first announced days after Maduro's capture, on 8 January, that \"a significant number\" of prisoners would be freed as a goodwill gesture.Opposition and human rights groups have said the government under Maduro for years used detentions of political prisoners to stamp out dissent and silence critics.Interim President Rodriguez has described the amnesty bill as being intended for the offering and receiving of forgiveness.Meanwhile, exiled opposition figurehead Edmundo González wrote on social media on Friday that there would be \"no lasting reconciliation without memory or responsibility\" in Venezuela. He added that a \"legitimate\" amnesty must come with \"truth, recognition and reparation\".Activists within the South American country have denounced delays to the amnesty law and a lack of transparency over who is being freed.",

    "body": "19 hours agoRebecca Morelle,Science Editor,Alison Francis,Senior Science JournalistandGreg Brosnan,Senior Science JournalistShutterstockThe astronauts will begin their journey on Nasa's Space Launch System rocket Nasa is targeting early March to launch a crew around the Moon for the first time in more than 50 years, in what would be humankind's furthest trip into space.The Artemis II mission will see four astronauts embark on a 10-day journey around the far side of the Moon and back to Earth, paving the way for a future lunar landing.Nasa set the earliest launch date of March 6 (early on March 7 in the UK) following a successful \"wet dress rehearsal\" - a critical pre-launch test where the rocket is filled with fuel and taken through the countdown sequence.It was the Artemis team's second attempt at a practice run at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\"Every night I look up at the Moon and I see it and I get real excited because I can feel she's calling us and we're ready,\" Nasa's Lori Glaze told a news conference on Friday.\"The excitement for Artemis II is really, really starting to build, we can really start to feel it. It's coming.\"The first rehearsal, which took place at the beginning of February, ended early because of a hydrogen fuel leak at the launch pad.Glaze said issues including with seals and filters had now been remedied.\"Yesterday we were able to fully tank the SLS rocket within the planned time line […] we also succesfully demonstrated the launch countdown,\" she said.Three Americans - Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch - and one Canadian, Jeremy Hansen, make up the Artemis II crew.Glaze said the crew were excited following the successful rehearsal and would go into quarantine later on Friday.They'll begin their journey on Nasa's mega Moon rocket: the 98m-tall (322ft) Space Launch System, or SLS.It's only flown once before in November 2022 for the Artemis I mission, but this was with no people onboard.The crew will be strapped into the Orion capsule, which is located at the top of the rocket.The inside of their spacecraft is about the size of a minibus, and it's where the four will live, eat, work and sleep during the 10-day mission.The first day of their journey will be spent in orbit around the Earth, then if all systems are working well, the astronauts will head towards the Moon.The voyage takes about four days, and the crew will travel around the far side of the Moon, which is the side we never see from Earth.They'll be at a distance of 6,500-9,500km (4,000 to 6,000 miles) above the lunar surface, and will have several hours dedicated to studying and taking images of the Moon.After the fly by, the astronauts will begin their four-day journey home. They will end the mission with a splash down in the Pacific Ocean.NASAApollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmitt visited the Moon in 1972The mission, if successful, will pave the way for Artemis III, which will see astronauts set foot on the lunar surface. The last time humans visited the Moon was in 1972 for the Apollo 17 mission.Nasa says the landing will happen by 2028, but this is a very ambitious timescale.Elon Musk's SpaceX company has a contract to build the lander for Artemis III - which will be flown to the Moon on a SpaceX Starship rocket. But delays to the Starship rocket have led Nasa to ask SpaceX for a new streamlined plan to speed a return to the Moon.Nasa has also asked rival company Blue Origin - which is owned by Jeff Bezos - to come up with an accelerated lunar plan for Artemis III.As the tech billionaires battle it out, the US is under pressure to return to the Moon. China is aiming for a lunar landing by 2030, and has been making steady progress towards this.Both nations are planning to land at the Moon's south pole - and are competing for the best spots to build their lunar bases.",

Local authorities have been trying to step up efforts to get a grip on the issue by using methods such as surveillance cameras to catch culprits.\"Ingenuity can never become an alibi for incivility,\" the municipality of Catania said in a post on its official Facebook page.\"Respect for urban etiquette and the environment is everyone's duty,\" it added.The post did not say whether any action had been taken.",

    "body": "4 hours agoReutersA major rescue operation was launched at St Anton after five skiers were caught in an avalanche some 450m wideFive people were killed in a series of avalanches in the Austrian Alps as heavy snowfall hit the region on Friday.A 42-year-old German man, caught in an avalanche with his 16-year-old son, was among the victims, police said. The teenager was airlifted to hospital from the slope in Nauders near the Swiss-Italian border.Three other skiers were killed in an avalanche near the popular St Anton resort, while a snowboarder died after being buried in the neighbouring Vorarlberg region.Austria has now seen at least 21 avalanche-related deaths this winter, while dozens of fatalities have been recorded across the Alps.The avalanche risk remains high in parts of Tyrol - meaning avalanches can be expected - where two fatal avalanches occurred on Friday in off-piste areas.Police told Austrian media the avalanche near St Anton am Arlberg, which killed three men, appeared to have been triggered by the skiers themselves.Two were American and Polish nationals, public broadcaster ORF reported, while the third was a 21-year-old Austrian who died in hospital.Two other men were recovered from the scene with injuries after a major operation involving four mountain rescue teams, three helicopters, as well as emergency services.Elsewhere, a 53-year-old man died after being crushed by a snow plough in the northern city of Linz.The vehicle slid down a set of stairs where the man had been clearing snow, ORF reported. He died at the scene.The significant snowfall in the region also caused power outages and transport chaos on Friday, particularly in the south-east.The Red Cross was deployed to help those stuck in traffic jams in the state of Styria, where a motoring organisation described the roads as \"virtually inaccessible to private vehicles\".Vienna International Airport temporarily closed in the morning, and afternoon services were \"disrupted\".The avalanche death toll in the Alps has been higher than usual this year, and includes three Britons killed in France's La Grave earlier this month.",

    "body": "57 minutes agoMaia DaviesGetty ImagesDomenico had been on life support for almost two months at Naples's Monaldi HospitalA toddler in Italy who received a damaged donor heart has died, the family's lawyer has said.Two-year-old Domenico died shortly before 09:30 local time (08:30 GMT) on Saturday, Francesco Petruzzi told reporters. Monaldi Hospital, where he was being treated, said he had suffered a \"sudden and irreversible worsening of his clinical condition\".The heart given to Domenico during a transplant in late December was reportedly transported to the hospital in direct contact with dry ice, causing severe tissue damage.Prosecutors have opened an investigation into the incident and six medics have been placed under formal investigation in a case which has sparked outrage in Italy.Petruzzi has said the organ arrived \"burned by frostbite\" after being transported over 800km (490 miles) from Bolzano to Naples in an unsuitable container alongside the ice, without a thermometer to alert the medical team to the low temperature.The two-year-old had been on life support in Naples for almost two months. His mother Patrizia Mercolino had appealed to the Pope to help her son.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the \"whole of Italy mourns the loss of little Domenico, a warrior who will never be forgotten\".She wrote on X: \"On behalf of myself and the government, I offer my sincerest condolences and deepest sympathy to his mother Patrizia, his father Antonio and all his loved ones.\"I am certain that the competent authorities will shed full light on this terrible incident.\"On Wednesday, a panel of paediatric specialists concluded Domenico's condition was \"not compatible\" with another transplant.Doctors had warned a prolonged use of the life support system might have compromised his lungs, liver and kidneys.Petruzzi said at the time the family wanted to see all the relevant medical records: \"If the time for hope has ended, then the time for responsibility has begun.\"Italy's Health Minister Orazio Schillaci said earlier this week that \"we must absolutely clarify what happened\".\"We owe it to the child, to the family, but also to all Italians.\"\"We have an excellent national health service, which has been able to handle and almost always resolve complex situations. So, I believe citizens should not lose faith.\"",

An autopsy did not reveal any evidence of foul play.Griffiths co-founded Asos in 2000 and remained a significant shareholder after leaving the firm five years later.City AM/ShutterstockQuentin Griffiths, pictured in 2008An Asos spokesperson said: \"We're saddened to hear about the passing of Quentin, one of our original co-founders.\"He played an important role in Asos's earliest days and we're forever grateful for his contribution.\"Our thoughts are with his family and friends.\"A Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"We are supporting the family of a British national who has died in Thailand and are in contact with the local authorities.\"Police in Pattaya told the BBC Griffiths was found dead outside a luxury hotel where he had been staying in as a long-term resident in a suite on the 17th floor.He was involved in two ongoing court cases that might have caused him stress, police also told the BBC.Griffiths was separated from his second wife, a Thai national, and had reportedly been engaged in a legal dispute with her over a business they ran together, the BBC understands.He co-founded Asos in London with Nick Robertson, Andrew Regan and Deborah Thorpe.Its name originally stood for As Seen On Screen as it sold fashion inspired by clothing worn by TV and film stars.It grew to become an online fashion marketplace stocking hundreds of brands as well as its own lines and at one time was valued at more than £6bn.Its largest shareholders include Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen - who owns Danish clothing giant Bestseller and Mike Ashley, owner of Frasers Group.Additional reporting by Thanyarat Doksone in BangkokIf you are suffering distress or despair, details of help and support in the UK are available at BBC Action Line",

The Trump administration said it stood ready to provide consular assistance, but did not respond to claims its policies had failed to stem a surge in settler violence.The Israeli embassy in Washington said the incident was under review and an \"operational inquiry... must be completed as soon as possible\".Abu Siyam was a US citizen born in Philadelphia.His family said he was among approximately 30 residents of the village of Mukhmas who were trying to stop armed settlers from stealing their goats on Wednesday. As both residents and settlers threw stones, said one witness, settlers shot at least three of the villagers, including Abu Siyam, who was struck fatally. Abdulhamid Siyam, cousin to Abu Siyam, told the BBC that the 19-year-old's death was a \"big loss\" and the actions of settlers in the West Bank had gone unchecked.\"A young man of 19 shot and killed in this cold blood and no responsibility, impunity completely,\" he said.The Trump administration has faced criticism from rights groups for lifting Biden-era sanctions on violent settlers, who have rarely faced criminal punishments from Israeli authorities. The US State Department said it was aware of the death of a US citizen and was \"carefully monitoring the situation\". A spokesperson for the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) said that soldiers had attended the scene and used \"riot dispersal means to restore order\". \"No IDF fire  was reported during the course of the incident,\" the IDF statement said. The spokesperson confirmed that the incident was under review, and said \"a continuous military presence\" would remain in the area in the coming days to prevent further incidents.",

    "body": "9 hours agoOttilie MitchellRon Galella Collection via Getty ImagesAnna Murdoch-Mann, writer and ex-wife of media baron Rupert Murdoch, has died aged 81, his media outlets have announced.Married to the media mogul for 31 years, she played an influential role on the board of his publishing giant, News Corp.She was mother to three of Murdoch's children, Elisabeth, James, and Lachlan Murdoch - who is now chairman of Fox and News Corp - and stepmother to his daughter, Prudence.Murdoch-Mann, who was also a philanthropist, died on 17 February \"surrounded by family\" at her home in Palm Beach, Florida.Born Anna Torv in Glasgow and raised as a Catholic, she moved to Australia aged nine. After her parents' divorce, she is said to have brought up her own siblings.She became a reporter for the Sydney Daily Telegraph and the Sydney Daily Mirror, where she met Rupert Murdoch and went on to serve on the board of his company.\"He never made a major business decision without her input\", The Australian, another title in his media stable, writes.She penned several novels during their marriage, including the 1988 Family Business about a multi-generational media dynasty. Ron Galella Collection via Getty ImagesMurdoch-Mann in 1987 with her then-husband and sons Lachlan (far-left) and James.Muriel McKay was killed by her kidnappers and there have been renewed efforts to find her body in recent years.The then-Murdochs divorced in 1999 in one of the most expensive separations in history - Murdoch-Mann received a $1.7bn (£1bn) settlement.Murdoch married his third wife, Wendi Deng, 17 days later.In an exclusive interview after her separation, Murdoch-Mann told Australian Women's Weekly, \"I think there's going to be a lot of heartbreak and hardship\" over the succession for Murdoch's media empire.\"There's been such a lot of pressure that they needn't have had at their age,\" she added.These tensions inspired the television series Succession and played out in courts in real life too. A years-long court battle ended with Murdoch's eldest son, Lachlan, being set to control the news group late last year.Murdoch-Mann went on to remarry, first to financier William Mann, who died in 2017. She later wed her third husband, Ashton dePeyster, who survives her along with 10 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.The philanthropist served on the boards of several children's hospitals including in Los Angeles and Haiti.

    "body": "2 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondentEPAIsraeli air strikes have killed at least 10 people in eastern Lebanon, Lebanese officials say, despite a ceasefire.Israel's military said it targeted sites belonging to Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim militia and political party, in the Bekaa Valley, an area where the group has a strong presence.Hezbollah confirmed that at least six of its members had been killed, including a senior field commander.The strikes are among the deadliest in Lebanon since a ceasefire ended the war between Israel and Hezbollah in November 2024.Images posted online from one of the locations hit on Friday night showed heavy damage in what appeared to be a residential neighbourhood.In a statement, the Israeli military said it had struck \"Hezbollah command centres\" and that Hezbollah \"systematically embeds its assets within the civilian population\". It said the group's activities were \"a violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon\".Hezbollah, considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US, says the ceasefire deal only applies to southern Lebanon, in the area between the Litani river and the Blue Line, the unofficial border between Lebanon and Israel.The group, however, has so far rejected calls from Lebanese authorities to discuss the future of its weapons elsewhere in the country, including in the Bekaa Valley, where part of its arsenal is believed to be located.This week, Hezbollah dismissed a decision by the government to advance the second phase of the disarmament plan in areas between north of the Litani and the Awali river, in the port city of Sidon.Lebanon's government said Israel's ongoing actions were a violation of the ceasefire deal and urged the international community to put pressure on Israel to stop its attacks. The Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam recently said the situation had become a \"one-sided war of attrition\".Hours before the attacks in the east, an Israeli strike hit the densely populated Palestinian refugee camp of Ain al-Helweh, on the outskirts of Sidon, in the country's south.The Israeli military said it had struck a \"command centre\" that had been used by Hamas, which said two members had been killed.The strikes come amid heightened tensions in the region, with the United States threatening to attack Iran if negotiations between the two countries fail to reach a deal.There are concerns in Lebanon that Iran might force Hezbollah to join its response to an attack if Israel becomes involved.",

    "body": "5 hours agoOttilie MitchellReutersEight people were killed in a mass shooting in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia earlier in FebruaryOpenAI banned a ChatGPT account owned by the suspect of a mass shooting in British Columbia more than half a year before the attack took place.The AI company said they had identified an account owned by Jesse Van Rootselaar in June 2025 under abuse and enforcement detection, which includes identifying accounts being used to further violence.OpenAI said it did not alert authorities to the account because its usage did not meet its threshold of a credible or imminent plan for serious physical harm to others.It said its thoughts were with everyone affected by the tragedy and that following the attack it had \"proactively\" contacted Canadian police with information on the suspect.Van Rootselaar is suspected of having shot and killed eight people in rural Tumbler Ridge on 12 February in one of the deadliest attacks in Canada's history. According to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the story, \"about a dozen staffers debated whether to take action on Van Rootselaar's posts.\"Some had identified the suspect's usage of the AI tool as an indication of real world violence and encouraged leaders to alert authorities, the US outlet reported. But, it said, leaders of the company decided not to do so.In a statement, a spokesperson for OpenAI said: \"In June 2025, we proactively identified an account associated with this individual [Jesse Van Rootselaar] via our abuse detection and enforcement efforts, which include automated tools and human investigations to identify misuses of our models in furtherance of violent activities.\"They said the company would continue to support the police's investigation.The BBC has contacted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for comment.OpenAI has said it will uphold its policy of alerting authorities only in cases of imminent risk because alerting them too broadly could cause unintended harm. It has also said that it trains ChatGPT to discourage imminent real-world harm when it identifies a dangerous situation and to refuse to help people that are attempting to use the service for illegal activities.The company added that it is constantly reviewing its referral criteria with experts and that it is reviewing the case for improvements. The deadly attack on Tumbler Ridge Secondary School saw a further 27 people injured.Van Rootselaar was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the school. Police said the suspect was born a biological male but identified as a woman.Van Rootselaars's mother and step-brother were among the victims of the shooting. Both were found dead at a local residence, police said.The motive for the attack is not yet known.",

    "body": "1 day agoMohammad Sartaj AlamBBC Hindi, JharkhandMohammad Sartaj Alam/BBCThe spot where the woman and child were burned after a mob stormed their houseFour people have been arrested in the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand for allegedly burning to death a woman and her 10-month-old son on suspicion of practising witchcraft earlier this week.The woman's husband, who was also attacked, suffered severe burns and is in hospital.Police say they are searching for more people who may be involved. The accused are in custody and haven't commented publicly yet.According to the National Crime Records Bureau, more than 2,500 people, mostly women, were killed in India on suspicion of witchcraft between 2000 and 2016.Mohammad Sartaj Alam/BBCThe murders occurred in the Kudsai hamlet of Jharkhand stateSuch cases are often reported from areas inhabited by disadvantaged tribal communities, where superstition is rife and a non-existent public health system leads to dependence on quacks for medical advice.The murders in Jharkhand occurred in the Kudsai hamlet, a remote tribal settlement of around 50 mud houses located 250km (155.3 miles) from the state capital, Ranchi.​The violence appears to have been triggered by recent incidents in the village, including rumours of sudden cattle deaths and the illness and death of a local man named Pustun Birua.His wife Jano Birua says she consulted an informal healthcare provider - common in villages where no doctors are available - when he began suffering from anxiety and fainting spells. He told her that her husband was not suffering from any physical illness.Asked why she did not take him to a hospital, she said: \"We are poor people, so it wasn't possible to take him that far.\"Meanwhile, rumours spread that Jyoti Sinku was practising witchcraft and was responsible for the man's illness.Pustun Birua died on Tuesday evening. That night, according to Jyoti's husband Kolhan Sinku who is in hospital, a mob of about a dozen people, including five women, stormed their home and set fire to his wife and child.Recalling the horror from his hospital bed, he said: ​\"I pleaded with folded hands to have the matter resolved in the village council but the attackers didn't listen to me.\"Based on the testimonies of Kolhan Sinku and another family member, the district police have registered a complaint of murder and criminal conspiracy.Police say four men have been arrested and a special police team has been set up to track down other members of the mob.They added that they would organise programmes in rural areas to raise awareness against superstitions.",

    "body": "14 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jr,White House reporterandCachella SmithGetty ImagesIran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has said a proposal for an agreement with the US will be ready in daysUS President Donald Trump has said he is considering a limited military strike on Iran in order to pressure its leaders to agree a deal to curb the nuclear programme.The president made the remark in response to a question from a journalist hours after officials had suggested the possibility of a strike.On Thursday, Trump said the world would find out \"over the next, probably, 10 days\" whether a deal would be reached or the US would take military action. The US has been increasing its military presence in the region in recent weeks.The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something Iran has always denied.  US and Iranian officials have met over the issue in Switzerland and said progress has been made in the talks.Speaking on Friday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Iran was preparing \"a draft of a possible agreement\" and would hand it over to US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff in the next few days.The talks in Geneva were held as American forces continued ramping up their presence in the vicinity of Iran.The deployment includes the world's largest warship, USS Gerald R Ford, appearing to be heading towards the region.USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier is also being deployed, joining an increase of destroyers, combat ships and fighter jets.Satellite images have also shown that Iran has reinforced military facilities, and the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei, has posted messages to social media threatening US forces.\"The US President constantly says that the US has sent a warship toward Iran. Of course, a warship is a dangerous piece of military hardware,\" one of Khamenei's posts read.Trump takes questions from journalists several times a week - often in lengthy sessions in the Oval Office or on Air Force One - but his comments do not necessarily always translate into concrete actions, and often contradict each other.He is fond of reminding reporters that he prefers to keep his intentions to himself and a small circle of insiders to avoid potential adversaries knowing his next moves.\"I'm not going to talk to you about that,\" he snapped at a reporter on Thursday when asked about potential military action. \"We're going to make a deal or get a deal one way or the other.\"Even if an operation is carried out, Trump has so far yet to specify what the precise military objective would be, with US officials having reportedly presented him with a wide range of options for what could be a weeks-long campaign.In the past, Trump has also used deadlines to achieve an element of surprise.At the time of Operation Midnight Hammer in July last year - which saw US forces strike Iranian nuclear facilities - White House officials were still publicly discussing the possibility of successful talks.The day before US missiles and bombs struck the facility, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt read a statement from Trump in which he said that because \"negotiations may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks\".Any strikes in the near future would come at a challenging time domestically for the Trump administration, with polls showing that a growing number of Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of immigration and the economy.Unlike the one-day strike in Iran last year and the quick operation to capture Nicolás Maduro in January, a protracted, multi-week conflict with Iran threatens alienating parts of Trump's Maga base which were drawn to his campaign promise of an end to messy foreign entanglements.",

    "body": "1 day agoBethany BellBBC Vienna correspondentReutersThomas P, who cannot be identified under Austrian law, is appealing against the guilty verdictAn Austrian climber has been found guilty of gross negligent manslaughter after his girlfriend froze to death on Austria's highest mountain last year.The man, named only as Thomas P in line with Austrian privacy laws, has been given a five-month suspended sentence and fined €9,600 (£8,400).His girlfriend, Kerstin G, died of hypothermia during a climbing trip on the Grossglockner mountain in January 2025.In a statement sent to the BBC, the court said it considered Thomas P's previous clean record and the loss of a person close to him \"to be mitigating factors\". It said it also took into account \"the public discussion on social media, which was incriminating for the defendant\".The judge, Norbert Hofer, himself an experienced climber who works with mountain and helicopter rescue teams in Tyrol, said Thomas P was an excellent Alpinist, but that his girlfriend was light-years behind him in terms of her climbing abilities.He said the couple should have turned back as Kerstin G did not have enough experience in winter conditions.Although the judge decided Thomas P had misjudged the situation, he said he had not left her behind \"wilfully\": \"I don't see you as a murderer, I don't see you as cold-hearted.\"The court also heard from Andrea B, a former girlfriend of Thomas P, who described how he had left her alone on a previous tour on the Grossglockner in 2023. She said she had been at the end of her tether, feeling dizzy and her headlight had gone out. She said she was crying and screaming when he suddenly disappeared, walking ahead and leaving her behind.Grossglockner mountain in AustriaThe judge also questioned Thomas P's account of how he had left Kerstin on the mountainside. Hofer suggested instead that, based on her position in the photos taken by the rescue team, she may have had a fall.The court heard how the mountain rescue team found her body hanging upside down from a rock face, according to Austrian reports.\"We were amazed that she remained in that position,\" one of the rescuers told the court. If the wind had been any stronger, \"she would have fallen over the south face\".The prosecution said there were strong winds of up to 74 km/h (45 mph), and it was very cold. It was -8C, with a windchill temperature of -20C, they said.They argued that as the more experienced climber, Thomas P was \"the responsible guide for the tour\". They said he failed to turn back or call for help in time to help his girlfriend.Thomas P should never have allowed himself to get into this situation, the prosecutor said.Thomas P pleaded not guilty. He told the court he was deeply sorry. He said he had loved his girlfriend, who was very sporty and that they had planned the trip together.His lawyer Kurt Jelinek said the couple had found themselves in a really difficult and stressful situation.He said Kerstin G was not inexperienced and knew what she was getting into.Her parents told the court she had been \"really active\" in mountaineering since 2020, and her mother said she would not have \"gone along blindly\".Forensic pathologist Claudia Wöss confirmed to the court that she had died of hypothermia, adding that she had found evidence of viral pneumonia and the painkiller ibuprofen in Kerstin G's body. She was unable to assess whether her physical capacity had been impaired by the illness, and if it had made a sudden decline in her condition more likely.www.foto-webcam.euThis still from webcam footage shows the couple still climbing at 21:00 on 18 JanuaryProsecutors say the couple got stuck on the mountain and that Thomas P failed to call the police and did not send any distress signals when a police helicopter flew overhead at around 22:30.Video footage from the helicopter showed the couple still climbing. The judge noted that no distress signals were sent.The defence argued that at that point Thomas P and girlfriend still felt fine and did not call for help as they were close to the summit.Webcam images show lights from their torches as they scaled the mountain.But shortly afterwards, the defence said the situation changed dramatically, when Kerstin G became exhausted close to the summit.The defence said that she told Thomas P to go to get help.At 00:35 on 19 January, he called the mountain police. The content of the conversation is disputed. Rescuers said it wasn't an emergency call but the lawyer says he denies telling police that everything was fine.He scaled the summit and descended on the other side, leaving Kerstin G behind. Prosecutors say he left her at 02:00.Webcam images show his torch-lit figure coming down from the summit.The trial sparked interest and debate, not just in Austria but in mountain climbing communities far beyond its borders, raising questions about when personal judgement and risk-taking become a matter of criminal liability.The case is subject to appeal.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "10 hours agoDaniel BushWashington correspondentWatch: Trump says he's \"ashamed\" of Supreme Court judges over tariffs rulingUS President Donald Trump lashed out in unusually personal terms against the six Supreme Court justices who handed him one of the biggest setbacks of his second term in office by striking down the administration's global tariffs.The court's Friday ruling was \"deeply disappointing\". The justices who joined the majority opinion should be \"absolutely ashamed\" and lacked the courage to \"do the right thing\", Trump said, turning his response into a sweeping attack against a co-equal branch of government.The broadside was remarkable even for a president known for blowing past political norms and publicly berating those who challenge his authority.\"I'm ashamed of certain members of the court. Absolutely ashamed for not having the courage to do what's right for our country,\" Trump said at the start of a press conference at the White House, which was held a few hours after the decision was released.Trump did not mince words from there as he assessed the decision, which held that presidents do not have inherent authority to impose sweeping tariffs on any country.For the next 45 minutes, Trump criticised the ruling and made the case that he would find other methods to continue imposing tariffs on other countries. But throughout he repeatedly returned to the justices in ways that made clear he felt personally slighted by the decision.The president did not discriminate against Republican and Democratic appointees, either.The six justices who struck down Trump's tariffs were equally divided among the court's liberal and conservative wings. Three - Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson - were appointed by Democratic presidents. The other three were appointed by Republicans. Chief Justice John Roberts is a George W Bush pick who wrote the majority opinion, and Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett were appointed by Trump in his first term in office.Trump went after them all.Watch: BBC inside Trump press briefing slamming Supreme Court tariffs ruling\"They're just being fools and lapdogs for the Rhinos and the radical left Democrats,\" Trump said, using shorthand for a term - Republicans in Name Only - that is deployed by some on the right to disparage other Republicans deemed not sufficiently loyal to the party.The president also claimed that the court was influenced by \"foreign interests\" in its decision, though he did not provide any details or evidence for the assertion.\"It's my opinion that the court has been swayed by foreign interests,\" he said.Trump declined to elaborate when a reporter pressed him to explain what he meant.When asked if he regretted nominating Gorsuch and Coney Barrett, the president stopped short of saying that he had made a mistake. But Trump said their votes were an \"embarrassment\" and brought up their families, a highly unusual move.\"It's an embarrassment to their families, to one another,\" Trump said.BBC NewsAt the same time, Trump heaped praise on the three members of the court, Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh, who voted to keep his tariffs authority intact. He gave special attention to Kavanaugh, his other first-term appointee.In a lengthy dissent, Kavanaugh said the government would be forced to refund billions in tariff revenue and said the process would be a \"mess.\" The president thanked Kavanaugh, as well as Thomas and Alito, \"for their strength and wisdom and love of our country\".Court watchers and trade experts said Trump's reaction wasn't surprising given how much he had invested in the outcome of the case.\"I think the court was well aware of the importance to the president of this decision,\" said Alan Wm Wolff, a former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization.Colin Grabow, a trade expert at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington, said the decision represented \"a victory for the rule of law\".\"It's unfortunate that he attacked these justices,\" Grabow said. \"The Supreme Court said [Trump] went too far,\" he added. \"President Trump took that as an affront. It's not a surprise.\"",

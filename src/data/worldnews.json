    "body": "The president of Spain's Valencia region, Carlos Mazón, has resigned after months of pressure over his handling of flash floods last year.A total of 229 people died in towns in the Valencia region on 29 October 2024, with a further eight dying in neighbouring regions, in Spain's worst natural disaster for decades.Many in Valencia blamed Mazón for the scale of the tragedy because of how he and his government responded that day. It emerged that the regional president had spent nearly four hours in a restaurant with a journalist, Maribel Vilaplana, while the floodwater was wreaking havoc and he did not attend emergency meetings during much of the day.Mazón's government also failed to issue an emergency alert to the phones of Valencia residents warning them of the floods and providing advice until after 20:00, by which times dozens of people had already died.\"I can't go on anymore... I know that I made mistakes, I acknowledge it and I will live with them for the rest of my life,\" Mazón said as he announced his decision, adding that he should have cancelled his schedule for that day to take charge of the crisis. \"I have said sorry and I say it again, but none of [the mistakes] were due to political calculation or bad faith.\"Polls had shown that the vast majority of people in Valencia wanted Mazón, of the conservative People's Party (PP), to step down because of his management of the floods. Monthly protests were held demanding his resignation, most recently on 25 October, when an estimated 50,000 people turned out on the streets of Valencia. Mazón had been making fewer public appearances in recent months because of the abuse he received from members of the public.However, his insistence on attending the memorial service for victims on the first anniversary of the tragedy last week angered relatives of those who died and a number of them barracked him during the ceremony. Mazón seemed shaken by the experience, which appeared to prompt his decision to resign.His announcement came the same day that Maribel Vilaplana, the journalist with who he had lunch on the day of the floods, testified before a judge who is investigating possible negligence.According to Spanish media reports, Vilaplana told the magistrate that Mazón \"was constantly texting on his phone\" and that at one point he received \"a lot of calls\".Mazón will continue as a member of the regional parliament, meaning he will have immunity from prosecution.During his resignation announcement, Mazón criticised the left-wing central government of Pedro Sánchez, accusing it of blocking aid to his region \"purely to cause us political damage\".Mazón has become an increasingly problematic figure for the PP over the last year, with concerns that his unpopularity threatened to undermine the party's electoral prospects not just in the Valencia region but nationwide. However, his replacement has been complicated by the fact that the PP relies on the parliamentary support in the region of the far-right Vox. That party, which has been gaining ground on the PP in polls there, will have to agree to his successor.",

    "body": "3 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterBBC/Getty ImagesBlake Lively and Justin Baldoni have been at loggerheads since starring together in It Ends With UsJustin Baldoni's $400m (£295m) lawsuit against his former co-star Blake Lively has been formally ended by a judge, who said the actor and director had failed to meet a deadline to continue his claim.The pair, who starred in the 2024 film It Ends with Us, have been locked in a bitter legal battle since Lively sued Baldoni last December accusing him of sexual harassment and waging a smear campaign against her.In response, he filed a lawsuit against her as well as her husband Ryan Reynolds, their publicist and the New York Times, claiming civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.Baldoni's case was dismissed in June, but he had a chance to file an amended complaint. However, Judge Lewis Liman said he had failed to do.ReutersBaldoni also named Lively's husband Ryan Reynolds in the lawsuitThe judge said he had contacted all of the parties on 17 October to give them warning that he would enter a final judgement to conclude the case.Only Lively responded, asking for the final judgement to be declared, but for her request for legal fees to remain active. The judge agreed.Her original lawsuit against Baldoni is also ongoing.After Baldoni's case was dismissed in June, the actress's lawyers called it \"a total victory and a complete vindication\".At the time, Baldoni's lawyer said Lively's \"predictable declaration of victory is false\", and that \"with the facts on our side, we march forward\".He added: \"While the court dismissed the defamation related claims, the court has invited us to amend four out of the seven claims against Ms Lively, which will showcase additional evidence and refined allegations.\"However, those amended claims were not filed, according to the latest ruling. Baldoni and Wayfarer have not commented.ReutersJustin Baldoni directed and starred in It Ends With Us, based on the Colleen Hoover novelIn June, Judge Liman explained that Baldoni's lawsuit centred on two claims: that Lively \"stole the film\" from him and his production company Wayfarer by threatening not to promote it, and that she and others promoted a false narrative that Baldoni sexually assaulted her and launched a smear campaign against her.But Baldoni and his production company \"have not adequately alleged that Lively's threats were wrongful extortion rather than legally permissible hard bargaining or renegotiation of working conditions\", Judge Liman wrote at that time.Additionally, the judge wrote, Baldoni and his company did not prove defamation because the \"Wayfarer Parties have not alleged that Lively is responsible for any statements other than the statements\" in her lawsuit, which are privileged.The judge also determined that evidence did not show that the New York Times \"acted with actual malice\" in publishing their story, dismissing that $250m suit as well.\"The alleged facts indicate that the Times reviewed the available evidence and reported, perhaps in a dramatised manner, what it believed to have happened,\" he wrote. \"The Times had no obvious motive to favour Lively's version of events.\"",

    "body": "The Netherlands has said it will return a stolen 3,500-year-old sculpture to Egypt.It is \"highly likely\" the stone head, dating from the time of the pharaohs, was plundered during the Arab Spring in either 2011 or 2012, according to the Dutch  Information & Heritage Inspectorate.A decade later, it turned up at an arts and antiques fair in Maastricht and, following an anonymous tip-off, Dutch authorities determined it had been stolen and exported illegally. Dutch outgoing prime minister Dick Schoof made the pledge to hand it back as he attended the opening of the archaeological Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza this weekend.The Dutch government said the sculpture of a high-ranking official from the dynasty of Pharaoh Thutmose III is \"deeply meaningful to Egypt's identity\".The statue had been offered up for sale at The European Fine Art Foundation fair in 2022. The dealer voluntarily relinquished the sculpture after authorities had been tipped off about its illegal origin. The government said it expected to hand the stone head over to the Egyptian ambassador to the Netherlands at the end of this year.\"The Netherlands is committed both nationally and internationally to ensuring the return of heritage to its original owners,\" it said.The news comes as Egypt celebrated the opening of the enormous Grand Egyptian Museum showcasing its archaeological heritage this weekend.First proposed in 1992, the construction of the museum itself was interrupted by the Arab Spring.Costing around $1.2bn (£910m), the facility contains 100,000 artefacts, including the entire contents of the intact tomb of the boy king Tutankhamun and his famous gold mask.Prominent Egyptologists are hoping the museum will strengthen demands for key antiquities held in other countries to be returned.These include the Rosetta Stone, the key to deciphering hieroglyphics, which is on display at the British Museum in London.",

    "body": "Popular Malaysian rapper Namewee has been charged with illegal drug use and possession, local media reported on Monday, quoting Kuala Lumpur police.Namewee, who pleaded not guilty to both charges, has been released on bail after being arrested last month, authorities said.The 42-year-old is known for his satirical songs and music videos about taboo topics in Malaysia, from obscenity to religion to China's censorship.In an Instagram post on Sunday, Namewee denied using or carrying drugs.\"The truth will be out when the police report is released,\" he wrote.Kuala Lumpur police chief Fadil Marsus said that Namewee was arrested on 22 October in a hotel room, where they found pills believed to be ecstasy - also known as MDMA.Namewee later tested positive for illicit substances - including amphetamines, methamphetamine, ketamine, and THC - and was remanded for two days, Fadil said in a statement.If convicted of drug possession, he could be jailed up to five years and caned.A police official told local media that Namewee had been in the same hotel at the same time as Iris Hsieh, a Taiwanese influencer who was found dead in her hotel room bathtub.Namewee wrote on Instagram that he felt \"deeply sorry\" about Hsieh's death. The ambulance had taken \"nearly an hour\" to arrive at the scene, he wrote.He said that he had remained silent as the case was under investigation - though it's unclear if he's referring to his drug charges or Hsieh's death.He also claimed that he has received \"blackmail\" in recent days but would \"fight to the end\".Namewee has long courted controversy with his music.In 2016 he was arrested in Malaysia for his music video Oh My God, which was filmed at various places of worship around the country. Critics said the song insulted religious sensitivities.In 2021, he released the song Fragile, which poked fun at Chinese nationalists and touched on politically sensitive topics like the sovereignty of Taiwan and the persecution of Uyghurs in Xinjiang. The song went viral for Mandarin-speaking audiences but was banned by China.",

    "body": "An avalanche in Italy's Dolomite mountains has killed five German climbers, including a 17-year-old girl and her father, according to rescuers. The mountaineers, travelling in separate groups, were scaling Cima Vertana in the Ortler Alps at around 16:00 local time on Saturday when the fast-moving snow hit.  A group of three people \"was fully swept away by the avalanche\" and all died, said Italy's Alpine rescue service, Soccorso Alpino e Speleologico.Separately, the father and daughter were carried away by the avalanche and their bodies were recovered on Sunday. Two other climbers in a third party survived.The alarm was raised by the survivors, triggering the rescue operation.Olaf Reinstadler, a spokesperson for the Sulden Mountain Rescue Service, told German media that the avalanche on the 3,545-metre (11,630ft) mountain, also called Vertainspitze, could have been caused by recent snow drifts which had not bonded to the ice below.He said climbing tours were popular and the weather conditions were good, but wondered why the mountaineers were climbing late in the afternoon, as the descent would have then taken until nightfall.The bodies of the three people climbing together were recovered on Saturday before rescue efforts were suspended due to fading light and safety conditions. The Alpine rescue service said that due to fog and low visibility, helicopters could not take off at first light on Sunday.However, once conditions improved, rescuers and avalanche dog units were airlifted to 2,600 metres before setting out on foot.By late morning, the bodies of the two missing mountaineers - the father and daughter - were found.",

    "body": "4 hours agoKoh Ewe and Mahfouz Zubaide,BBC ProducerAfghans dig through rubble after earthquake destroys housesAt least 20 people have died after an earthquake struck northern Afghanistan, local authorities say, with the toll expected to rise as rescue efforts continue. Hundreds have also been left injured, local officials told the BBC.The earthquake struck near Mazar-e-Sharif, one of the country's largest cities that is home to about 500,000 people, at around 01:00 local time on Monday, (20:30 GMT on Sunday).It had a magnitude of 6.3 and a depth of 28km (17 miles), according to the US Geological Survey, and was marked at the orange alert level, which indicates \"significant casualties\" are likely. More than 530 people have been injured, according to the Taliban government health ministry.Provincial officials earlier told the BBC that casualties were likely to rise as rescue efforts continued.Getty ImagesAuthorities expect the death toll to rise as search and rescue efforts continueHaji Zaid, a Taliban spokesman in Balkh province wrote earlier on X that \"many people are injured\" in the Sholgara district, south of Mazar-e- Sharif. He said they had received \"reports of minor injuries and superficial damages from all districts of the province\". \"Most of the injuries were caused by people falling from tall buildings,\" he wrote.Many of Mazar-e Sharif's residents rushed to the streets when the quake struck, as they feared their houses would collapse, AFP news agency reported.The quake led to a power outage across the country including in the capital city Kabul, after electricity lines from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan - major suppliers of power to Afghanistan - were damaged. The Taliban spokesman in Balkh also posted a video on X appearing to show debris strewn across the ground at the Blue Mosque in Mazar-e-Sharif, revered by Shia Muslims.The mosque, built in the 15th Century, is believed to house the tomb of the first Shia Imam, the son-in-law and cousin of Prophet Mohamad. It is now a site where pilgrims gather to pray and celebrate religious events.Khalid Zadran, a Taliban spokesman for the police in Kabul, wrote on X that police are \"closely monitoring the situation\". Numerous fatalities were also reported in Samangan, a mountainous province near Mazar-e-Sharif, according to its spokesman. The quake on Monday comes after a 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck Afghanistan's mountainous eastern region in late August, killing more than 1,100 people.That earthquake was especially deadly as the rural houses in the region were typically made of mud and timber. Residents were trapped when their houses collapsed during the quake.Afghanistan is very prone to earthquakes because of its location on top of a number of fault lines where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet.Poor communication networks and infrastructure - buildings there are not earthquake-resistant, for example - have often hampered rescue efforts following disasters like this.",

    "body": "5 hours agoDearbail Jordan and David GrittenReuters/Hostages and Missing Families ForumCol Asaf Hamami, Staff Sgt Oz Daniel and Capt Omer Neutra were killed during the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attack on IsraelIsrael has confirmed the identities of three deceased hostages whose bodies it received from Hamas via the Red Cross in Gaza on Sunday.Forensic tests showed the remains were those of Israeli soldiers Col Asaf Hamami, 40, Capt Omer Neutra, 21, and Staff Sgt Oz Daniel, 19, the prime minister's office said.The confirmation means eight dead Israeli and foreign hostages are still in Gaza.Under the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal with Israel that started more than three weeks ago, Hamas agreed to return all 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was holding.Israel has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the dead hostages' bodies, while Hamas has insisted it is struggling to find them under rubble.The slow progress has meant there has been no advance on any of the substantive issues in the second phase of the ceasefire deal, including plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas, and how to organise the reconstruction of a territory left devastated by two years of war.Hamas's armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, handed over the remains of the three hostages to the Red Cross on Sunday night after saying they had been found \"along the route of one of the tunnels in the southern Gaza Strip\".The bodies were transferred to Israeli forces in Gaza before being transported to the National Centre of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv for identification.On Monday morning, the Israeli prime minister's office announced that the remains belonged to Col Hamami, Capt Neutra and Staff Sgt Daniel.\"The government of Israel shares in the deep sorrow of the Hamami, Neutra and Daniel families, and all the families of the deceased hostages,\" a statement said.\"The Hamas terrorist organisation is required to uphold its commitments to the mediators and return them as part of the implementation of the agreement. We will not compromise on this and will spare no effort until we return all of the hostages, every last one of them,\" it added.Col Hamami was commander of the Southern Brigade of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Gaza Division. The IDF said the father-of-three was among the first troops to reach the combat zones following the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023 and was \"the first to declare war\". He was killed fighting near Kibbutz Nirim and his body was then taken to Gaza by Hamas as a hostage, it added.Capt Neutra, an Israeli-American dual national who was born in the US and emigrated to Israel, was serving as a platoon commander in the IDF's 7th Brigade. The IDF said he was killed in battle near the Gaza perimeter and that his body was abducted by Hamas.Staff Sgt Daniel was serving in the IDF's 7th Armoured Brigade. He was also killed during a battle with Hamas gunmen near the Gaza perimeter and his body was taken by them as a hostage, according to the IDF.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel, which represents many hostages' relatives, said it \"bows its head in sorrow and shares in the profound grief\" of the three men's families.\"There are no words to express the depth of this pain. The hostages have no time. We must bring them all home, now!\"EPA/ShutterstockHamas has denied Israeli accusations that it is delaying the recovery of the remaining hostages' bodiesHamas and Israel have accused each other of repeated violations of the ceasefire since it took effect on 10 October.On Sunday, an Israeli air strike killed a man in northern Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.The Israeli military said it had struck a \"terrorist\" who had crossed the \"Yellow Line\", which demarcates territory in Gaza still under Israeli control, and was posing a threat to its troops.Under the deal, Hamas agreed to return all the hostages it was holding within 72 hours.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has so far handed over the bodies of 225 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 18 Israeli hostages so far returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Six of the eight dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.",

    "body": "16 hours agoFrank Gardnersecurity correspondent, in BahrainNato \"will stand with Ukraine up to the day in which we will have them sitting around the table for a long-lasting peace\", a senior official from the military alliance has told the BBC.Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, chair of Nato's military committee since January, added from an operational point of view he considered the Russia-Ukraine war was bogged down, and \"it was almost time to sit and talk because it's a waste of lives\".Pointing to the fact that Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 had resulted in two more countries joining the Western alliance - Finland and Sweden - Adm Dragone described the war as a strategic failure for Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite recent slow, incremental advances by Russia on the battlefield. \"They will not get a friendly or puppet government like in Belarus. Putin will not succeed.\"Asked if European nations were prepared to keep going with supporting Ukraine's defence, he said they were. It was beneficial, he believed that they had had something of a wake-up call and were now taking charge of their own defence.In June, Nato members agreed to raise their defence spending to 5% of GDP by 2035. The move followed repeated urges from US President Donald Trump for members to do so.On Russia's recent announcement about long-range, nuclear-powered weapons like the Burevestnik and the Poseidon, the former Italian chief of defence staff and naval aviator played down concerns by Nato, saying that it was a defensive nuclear alliance. \"We are not threatened by them,\" he said, \"we are just ready to defend our 32 nations and our one billion people. We are a nuclear alliance.\"On the risk of future invasions or attacks, Adm Dragone said if - and he emphasised the conditional here - there was to be anywhere it would likely be the Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. But he pointed out that as Nato states Article 5 would be requested - which considers an attack on one nation to be equivalent to an attack on all - and that Nato would come to their defence. Asked if that included the US, he replied: \"Yes, because they have committed to this and they have underlined that they are still in the business.\"Of all Nato defence needs right now, Adm Dragone said air defence was the top priority. Recent incursions by Russian drones into Poland and Romania have prompted the alliance to upgrade its air defences. Regarding the possibility of activating a notional \"drone wall\" on Nato's eastern borders, he said this would be done within months and that \"the alliance's Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk [Virginia] is already working on that\".\"There is a lot of stuff on the market which will fulfil our immediate needs so we set up a new activity which is Eastern Sentry... integrating all the air defence that we already have on our eastern flank. \"Airspace incursions are pretty frequent, we escort them out and that's basically the game,\" the admiral said.Despite no sign that Russia is changing course on the war in Ukraine and despite signs that some members - notably Slovakia and Hungary - are increasingly opposed to supporting Ukraine's defence, Adm Dragone ended on a positive note. \"The alliance is reliable, it is mature, there is a cohesion which is our centre of gravity.\"\"The alliance is stronger than our adversaries, and we will stay with Ukraine up to the day that peace will break out,\" he added.",

    "body": "33 minutes agoAoife Walsh,Washington and George WrightReutersDonald Trump has played down the possibility of a US war with Venezuela, but suggested Nicolás Maduro's days as the country's president were numbered.Asked if the US was going to war against Venezuela, the US president told CBS' 60 Minutes: \"I doubt it. I don't think so. But they've been treating us very badly.\"For two months, the US military has been building up a force of warships, fighter jets, bombers, marines, drones and spy planes in the Caribbean Sea. It is the largest deployment there for decades.The US continues to launch strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean. The Trump administration says the strikes are necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the US.Trump rejected suggestions that the US action was not about stopping narcotics, but aimed at ousting Maduro, a long-time Trump opponent, saying it was about \"many things\". At least 64 people have been killed by US strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific since early September, CBS News - the BBC's US news partner - reports.Speaking from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, Trump said: \"Every single boat that you see that's shot down kills 25,000 on drugs and destroys families all over our country.\"Pushed on whether the US was planning any strikes on land, Trump refused to rule it out, saying: \"I wouldn't be inclined to say that I would do that... I'm not gonna tell you what I'm gonna do with Venezuela, if I was gonna do it or if I wasn't going to do it.\"Long-range bomber planes, B-52s, have carried out \"bomber attack demonstrations\" off the coast of Venezuela. Trump has authorised the deployment of the CIA to Venezuela and the world's largest aircraft carrier is being sent to the region.Maduro has previously accused Washington of \"fabricating a new war\", while Colombian President Gustavo Petro has said the strikes on boats are being used by the US to \"dominate\" Latin America.Trump said the government was \"not going to allow\" people \"from all over the world\" to come in. \"They come in from the Congo, they come in from all over the world, they're coming, not just from South America. But Venezuela in particular - has been bad. They have gangs,\" he said, singling out Tren de Aragua. He called it \"the most vicious gang anywhere in the world\".Trump was also asked about nuclear testing, after he called on US military leaders to resume testing nuclear weapons in order to keep pace with other countries such as Russia and China.Asked by CBS's Norah O'Donnell if he planned for the US to detonate a nuclear weapon for the first time in more than 30 years, Trump said: \"I'm saying that we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes.\"However, Energy Secretary Chris Wright sought to calm global concerns by telling Fox News the US was not planning to conduct nuclear explosions.During his CBS interview, Trump also spoke about the US government shutdown, which has gone on for more than a month and left millions of Americans facing the loss of essential services.The president blamed Democrats, calling them \"crazed lunatics\" who have \"lost their way\" - but said he believed they would eventually capitulate and vote to end the shutdown.\"And if they don't vote, that's their problem,\" he said.It was Trump's first interview with CBS since he sued its parent company, Paramount, over a 2024 interview with then Vice-President Kamala Harris.He said the interview - which aired as part of the presidential election campaign - had been edited to \"tip the scales in favour of the Democratic Party\".Paramount agreed to pay $16m (£13.5m) to settle the suit, but with the money allocated to Trump's future presidential library, not paid to him \"directly or indirectly\". It said the settlement did not include a statement of apology.Trump last appeared on the 60 Minutes programme in 2020, when he walked out of an interview with Lesley Stahl because he claimed the questions were biased. He did not agree to an interview with the show during the 2024 election.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "20 hours agoJaroslav LukivReutersLast month's jewellery heist at the Louvre museum was carried out by petty criminals rather than organised crime professionals, Paris's prosecutor has said.\"This is not quite everyday delinquency... but it is a type of delinquency that we do not generally associate with the upper echelons of organised crime,\" Laure Beccuau told franceinfo radio.She said four people arrested and charged so far over the theft that shocked France and the world were \"clearly local people\" living in Seine-Saint-Denis, an impoverished area just north of Paris. Jewels worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the most-visited museum, in the French capital, on 19 October.Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen A tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenIn Sunday's interview to franceinfo radio, Beccuau said the four arrested people - three men and a woman - \"all live more or less in Seine-Saint-Denis\".She said two of the male suspects had been known to the police, as they each had multiple theft convictions.On Saturday, a 38-year-old woman was charged with complicity in organised theft and criminal conspiracy with a view to committing a crime.Separately, a man, aged 37, was charged with theft and criminal conspiracy.The suspects - who have not been publicly named - both denied any involvement.Beccuau said the two were in a relationship and had children together, without giving any further details.Two men who had previously been arrested were already charged with theft and criminal conspiracy after officials said they had \"partially recognised\" their involvement in the heist.Investigators believe four men carried out the daylight theft, and one of them is still on the run.Three other people detained earlier this week have been released without charge.Watch: Two people leave Louvre in lift mounted to vehicleOn the day of the heist, the suspects arrived at 09:30 local time (07:30 GMT), just after the museum opened to visitors, Ms Beccuau told reporters last week.The suspects arrived with a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine. The men used a disc cutter to crack open display cases housing the jewellery.Prosecutors said the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38, before switching to cars.One of the stolen items - a crown - was dropped during the escape. The other seven jewels have not been found.The fear is that they have already been spirited abroad, though the prosecutor in charge of the case has said she is still hopeful they can be retrieved intact.Since the incident, security measures have been tightened around France's cultural institutions.The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following the heist.",

    "body": "1 hour agoSebastian UsherJerusalemIDFMajor General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi resigned on Friday, admitting her role in leaking the videoThe former top lawyer in the Israeli military has been arrested, as a political showdown deepens over the leaking of a video that allegedly shows severe abuse of a Palestinian detainee by Israeli soldiers.Maj Gen Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi resigned as the Military Advocate General of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) last week, saying that she took full responsibility for the leak.On Sunday, the story took a darker turn when she was reported as missing, with police mounting an hours-long search for her on a beach north of Tel Aviv.She was subsequently found alive and well, police said, but was then taken into custody.The fallout from the leaked video is intensifying by the day.Broadcast in August 2024 on an Israeli news channel, the footage shows reserve soldiers at the Sde Teiman military base in southern Israel taking aside a detainee, then surrounding him with riot shields to block visibility while he was allegedly beaten and stabbed in the rectum with a sharp object.The detainee was subsequently treated for severe injuries.Five reservists were subsequently charged with aggravated abuse and causing serious bodily harm to the detainee. They have denied the charges have not been named.On Sunday, four of the reservists wore black balaclavas to hide their faces as they appeared at a news conference outside the Supreme Court in Jerusalem along with their lawyers, who demanded the dismissal of their trial.Adi Keidar, a lawyer from the right-wing legal aid organisation Honenu, claimed his clients were subject to \"to a faulty, biased and completely cooked-up legal process\".Anadolu via Getty ImagesThe leaked surveillance video was filmed at the Sde Teiman military base in southern IsraelLast week, a criminal investigation was launched into the leaking of the video.Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi was put on leave while the inquiry took place.On Friday, Defence Minister Israel Katz said she would not be allowed to return to her post.Shortly after that, Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi resigned.In her resignation letter, she said she took full responsibility for any material that was released to the media from the unit.\"I approved the release of material to the media in an attempt to counter false propaganda against the army's law enforcement authorities,\" she said.That is a reference to efforts by some right-wing political figures in Israel to claim that the allegations of severe abuse of the Palestinian detainee had been fabricated.She added: \"It is our duty to investigate whenever there is reasonable suspicion of acts of violence against a detainee.\"After her resignation, Katz issued a fierce condemnation of her conduct.\"Anyone who spreads blood libels against IDF troops is unfit to wear the army's uniform,\" he said.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu echoed his defence minister's words on Sunday, saying that the incident at Sde Teiman was \"perhaps the most severe public relations attack that the State of Israel has experienced since its establishment\".Hours later, the first reports began appearing in the Israeli media that Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi was missing, sparking fears that a political scandal had taken a turn towards tragedy.A massive search effort was launched. Several hours later, she was found \"safe and in good health\" in the coastal area of Herzliya, Israeli police said.Overnight, a police spokesperson announced that two people had been arrested on suspicion of \"leaking and other serious criminal offences\" as part of an investigation.Israeli media reported that the pair were Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi and the former chief military prosecutor, Col Matan Solomosh.ReutersIsraeli forces mounted an hours-long search for Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi when she went missing on SundayThe Sde Teiman incident has been a lightning rod for the division between the left and right in Israel.On the right, the leaking of the video is denounced as a defamation of the Israeli military, all but amounting to an act of treason.After Israeli military police went to Sde Teiman to question 11 reservists over the incident in July 2024, far-right protesters - including at least three lawmakers from Netanyahu's governing coalition - broke into the facility to show their support.On the left, Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi's decision to enable the footage to be released is seen as the one time she lived up to the responsibilities of her post.The video is regarded by the left as concrete evidence backing up multiple reports of abuse of Palestinian detainees since the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel.Last October, a report by a UN commission of inquiry alleged that thousands of child and adult detainees from Gaza had been \"subjected to widespread and systematic abuse, physical and psychological violence, and sexual and gender-based violence amounting to the war crime and crime against humanity of torture and the war crime of rape and other forms of sexual violence\".Israel's government said it rejected the accusations of widespread ill-treatment and torture of detainees, and insisted that it was \"fully committed to international legal standards\". It also said it had carried out thorough investigations into every complaint.",

    "body": "Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan has been sworn in for a second term amid tight security, following an election marred by violent protests and rejected by the opposition as a sham.The inauguration ceremony was held at a military parade ground in the capital, Dodoma, instead of a stadium as in previous years. It was closed to the public but was shown live on state TV.Samia was declared the winner on Saturday with 98% of the vote. She faced little opposition with key rival candidates either imprisoned or barred from running.International observers have raised concerns about the transparency of the election and its violent aftermath, with hundreds of people reportedly killed.The authorities have sought to downplay the scale of the violence. It has been difficult to obtain information from the country or verify the death toll, amid a nationwide internet shutdown in place since election day last Wednesday.Some Tanzanians have told the BBC they have not seen their relatives since then.A woman who asked to only be identified as Mama Kassim told the BBC that she has not seen her two sons since election day last Wednesday - and was unable to reach one of them.\"I don't know where he is, I don't know whether he has been arrested, I don't know if he is injured, I don't know if he is hospitalised, I don't know if he is dead.\"\"Oh God, protect my son. He's only 21 years old,\" she said.Another Tanzanian told the BBC he had not yet returned home in Dar es Salaam from his workplace since Wednesday due to a lack of transport.\"I had only 10,000 shillings ($4) on my phone. I sent it to my family on Friday to buy food, but it wasn't enough and it ran out yesterday. I have no more money. My children are hungry,\" he said.Wearing a red headscarf and dark glasses, Samia took her oath of office at a ceremony attended by regional leaders and dignitaries, including the presidents of Somalia, Zambia, Mozambique, and Burundi. State broadcaster TBC had earlier said the public would not attend the event.In her speech, Samia thanked the electoral commission for running the elections with \"unquestionable efficiency\".She expressed sadness over the violence that had resulted in \"loss of lives and destruction of public property\", describing it as a blot on Tanzania's image. She said \"it was not surprising\" that some of those arrested were not Tanzanians adding that security agencies were investigating. Opposition leaders and activists have said hundreds were killed in clashes with security forces. The opposition Chadema party told the AFP news agency that it had recorded \"no less than 800\" deaths by Saturday, while a diplomatic source in Tanzania told the BBC there was credible evidence that at least 500 people had died.The UN human rights office earlier said there were credible reports of at least 10 deaths in three cities.Following the unrest, the prices of food, fuel and other essentials have doubled or tripled in many areas. Schools and colleges are closed and there is no public transport. During her inauguration ceremony, Samia ordered authorities to immediately ensure that people's lives return to normal.Chadema - which was barred from competing - rejects the results announced by the electoral commission, saying they had \"no basis in reality as the truth is that no genuine election took place in Tanzania\". It has called for a fresh election.On election day, polling stations remained largely empty - but the electoral authorities later said turnout had been 87%.On Sunday, police spokesman David Misime blamed motorbike operators and foreign nationals for the violent demonstrations and vandalism.He said there were individuals who had \"entered the country illegally with the intention of causing chaos\".Mr Misime urged Tanzanians to report \"any foreigner who is unknown or whose activities in Tanzania are unclear\" to the authorities.His remarks come amid reports that several Kenyan nationals have gone missing in Tanzania. Kenyan activist Hussein Khalid said on X that he had received reports of a Kenyan teacher being killed and others still unaccounted for.The situation in Tanzania has sparked global concern, with Pope Leo XIV on Sunday calling for prayers, saying post-election violence had erupted \"with numerous victims\".EU foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas urged Tanzanian authorities to exercise restraint to preserve lives, while UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he was \"deeply concerned\" about the situation \"including reports of deaths and injuries\".The country's two main opposition leaders did not contest the election - Tundu Lissu is being held on treason charges, which he denies, while Luhaga Mpina of the ACT-Wazalendo party was excluded on legal technicalities.Sixteen fringe parties, none of whom have historically had significant public support, were allowed to run.The ruling party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), and its predecessor Tanu, have dominated the country's politics and have never lost an election since independence.Ahead of the election, rights groups condemned government repression, with Amnesty International citing a \"wave of terror\" involving enforced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings of opposition figures.The government rejected the claims, and officials said the election would be free and fair.Samia came into office in 2021 as Tanzania's first female president following the death of President John Magufuli.",

    "body": "Trump tells military to prepare for 'action' against Islamist militants in NigeriaUS President Donald Trump has ordered the military to prepare for action in Nigeria to tackle Islamist militant groups, accusing the government of failing to protect Christians.Trump did not say which killings he was referring to, but claims of a genocide against Nigeria's Christians have been circulating in recent weeks and months in some right-wing US circles.Groups monitoring violence say there is no evidence to suggest that Christians are being killed more than Muslims in Nigeria, which is roughly evenly divided between followers of the two religions.An advisor to Nigeria's president told the BBC that any military action against the jihadist groups should be carried out together.Daniel Bwala said Nigeria would welcome US help in tackling the Islamist insurgents but noted that it was a \"sovereign\" country.He also said the jihadists were not targeting members of a particular religion and that they had killed people from all faiths, or none. Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu has insisted there is religious tolerance in the country and said the security challenges were affecting people \"across faiths and regions\".Trump wrote in a social media post on Saturday that he had instructed the US Department of War to prepare for \"possible action\".And on Sunday, Trump reiterated that his country could deploy troops to Nigeria or carry out airstrikes to stop the alleged killings.\"They're killing record numbers of Christians in Nigeria. They're killing the Christians and killing them in very large numbers. We're not going to allow that to happen,\" the US president said.In Saturday’s post he warned that he might send the military into Nigeria \"guns-a-blazing\" unless the Nigerian government intervened, and said that all aid to what he called \"the now disgraced country\" would be cut.Trump had said: \"If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!\"US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth then replied to the post by writing: \"Yes sir.\"The Department of War is preparing for action. Either the Nigerian Government protects Christians, or we will kill the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.\"Trump's threat triggered alarm across Nigeria. Many on social media urged the government to step up its fight against Islamist groups to avert a situation where foreign troops are sent into the country.But Mr Bwala, who said he was a Christian pastor, told the BBC's Newshour programme that Trump had a \"unique way of communicating\" and that Nigeria was not taking his words literally.\"We know the heart and intent of Trump is to help us fight insecurity,\" he said, adding that he hoped Trump would meet Tinubu in the coming days to discuss the issue.Trump earlier announced that he had declared Nigeria a \"Country of Particular Concern\" because of the \"existential threat\" posed to its Christian population. He said \"thousands\" had been killed, without providing any evidence.This is a designation used by the US State Department that provides for sanctions against countries \"engaged in severe violations of religious freedom\".Following this announcement, Tinubu said his government was committed to working with the US and the international community to protect communities of all faiths.\"The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality,\" the Nigerian leader said in a statement.Jihadist groups such as Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province have wrought havoc in north-eastern Nigeria for more than a decade, killing thousands of people - however most of these have been Muslims, according to Acled, a group which analyses political violence around the world.In central Nigeria, there are also frequent clashes between mostly Muslim herders and farming groups, who are often Christian, over access to water and pasture. Deadly cycles of tit-for-tat attacks have also seen thousands killed, but atrocities have been committed on both sides and human rights group say there is no evidence that Christians have been disproportionately targeted.Trump has frequently expressed satisfaction over not having embroiled the US in a war during his tenure, and has cast himself as a peace-making president.But the Republican leader is facing a growing number of voices domestically, particularly from the political right, who have drawn attention to the situation in Nigeria.Additional reporting by Chris Ewokor in Abuja",

    "body": "The US is not planning to conduct nuclear explosions, Energy Secretary Chris Wright has said, calming global concerns after President Donald Trump called on the military to resume weapons testing.\"These are not nuclear explosions,\"  Wright told Fox News on Sunday. \"These are what we call non-critical explosions.\"The comments come days after Trump wrote on Truth Social that he had directed defence officials to \"start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis\" with rival powers.But Wright, whose agency oversees testing, said people living in the Nevada desert should have \"no worries\" about seeing a mushroom cloud.\"Americans near historic test sites such as the Nevada National Security Site have no cause for concern,\" Wright said. \"So you're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry, and they set up the nuclear explosion.\" Trump's comments on Truth Social last week were interpreted by many as a sign the US was preparing to restart full-scale nuclear blasts for the first time since 1992.In an interview with 60 Minutes on CBS, which was recorded on Friday and aired on Sunday, Trump reiterated his position.\"I'm saying that we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes,\" Trump said when asked by CBS's Norah O'Donnell if he planned for the US to detonate a nuclear weapon for the first time in more than 30 years.\"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it,\" he added.Russia and China have not carried out such tests since 1990 and 1996 respectively. Pressed further on the topic, Trump said: \"They don't go and tell you about it.\"\"I don't want to be the only country that doesn't test,\" he said, adding North Korea and Pakistan to the list of nations allegedly testing their arsenals.On Monday, China's foreign ministry denied conducting nuclear weapons tests.As a \"responsible nuclear-weapons state, China has always... upheld a self-defence nuclear strategy and abided by its commitment to suspend nuclear testing\", spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a regular press conference in Beijing.She added that China hoped the US would \"take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and maintain global strategic balance and stability\".On Thursday, Russia too denied it had carried out nuclear tests.\"Regarding the tests of Poseidon and Burevestnik, we hope that the information was conveyed correctly to President Trump,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists, referencing the names of Russian weapons. \"This cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test.\"North Korea is the only country that has carried out nuclear testing since the 1990s - and even Pyongyang announced a moratorium in 2018.The exact number of nuclear warheads held by each country is kept secret in each case - but Russia is thought to have a total of about 5,459 warheads while the US has about 5,177, according to the Federation of American Scientists (FAS).The US-based ACA gives slightly higher estimates, saying America's nuclear stockpile sits at about 5,225 warheads, while Russia has approximately 5,580.China is the world's third largest nuclear power with about 600 warheads, France has 290, the United Kingdom 225, India 180, Pakistan 170, Israel 90 and North Korea 50, the FAS says.According to US think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), China has roughly doubled its nuclear arsenal in the past five years and is expected to exceed 1,000 weapons by 2030.",

    "body": "1 day agoTheo LeggettBusiness CorrespondentJas BainsJas Bains alerted Danish authorities to a £1bn tax scam and they hit him with a lawsuit\"We'd be met at airports in 20-foot limousines, and taken to places like the Atlantis hotel in Dubai or the Singapore Grand Prix. There'd be a hundred grand spent in the bar.\"In 2013, Jas Bains was an ambitious young lawyer, enjoying the high life that came with working for an extremely profitable City hedge fund.Today, he is jobless and has lost most of his wealth, having spent years fighting legal battles and attempting to clear his name of association with a huge tax scam.The irony, he says, is that he blew the whistle on the scam in the first place – only to find himself one of the targets of a £1.4bn lawsuit.He is reflecting one month after the case ended, bringing to a close eight years of legal arguments and one of the highest value civil cases ever heard in the UK.The Danish tax authority was left licking its wounds, after failing to establish that a large group of defendants, including Mr Bains, were liable for huge losses it had suffered.It all began in 2009, when a banker named Sanjay Shah established a London-based hedge fund called Solo Capital. It also had offices in Dubai. It was one of a network of funds, banks and legal outfits that were to become heavily implicated in the so-called cum-ex trade.This focused on transactions where shares were sold from one investor to another immediately before the payment of a dividend (cum, or with, dividend) but delivered afterwards (ex-dividend).Those involved exploited delays in processing the sale to create confusion over who actually owned the shares at the moment when the dividend was paid. This tactic allowed both parties to claim rebates on withholding tax - a levy which had only been paid once, when the dividend was issued.From the outside, it was complicated, but for those involved it led to ever bigger and more elaborate trades which ultimately cost taxpayers across Europe billions.It initially became popular in Germany, before spreading to other countries including France, Belgium, Italy and Austria. Solo Capital targeted Denmark, with the bulk of its cum-ex trades taking place from 2013 onwards.Jas Bains joined the company in 2010, as its head lawyer, but went on to run the London office. At the time, Solo was \"a successful firm, making money in five or six different areas pretty well\".Getty ImagesSanjay Shah was imprisoned in Denmark in a separate criminal trial last year And making money meant enjoying the high life, with staff going on sprees to places like Las Vegas, Singapore and Dubai.\"What I will say about Sanjay is he knew how to throw a party,\" he says.\"One time we were in the Ku De Ta club at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in Singapore. He bought 20 bottles of vintage Dom Perignon champagne, and people were just spraying each other with the stuff.\"People have likened it to Wolf of Wall Street and such like.\"It didn't end there. \"Sanjay organised private concerts in Dubai with Prince. A small room with him and his friends at three or four million dollars for an evening ... private concerts with Snoop Dogg.\"By mid-2014, however, Mr Bains had fallen out with his boss and left the company for a competitor. At the time, the cum-ex transactions targeting Denmark were dramatically picking up.\"I was hearing from people who'd left Solo that Sanjay was doing some big trades in 2014, but look, I'd moved on, it didn't have much to do with me,\" he says.\"But then I heard, actually Sanjay made close to €100m in trades from Denmark in 2013, closer to €250m in 2014 and he was looking for a billion in 2015.\"Alarm bells were ringing.Jas BainsAt the height of his career Jas Bains enjoyed living the high life in Las Vegas, Singapore and Dubai.\"I thought this can't be right. It's not that I thought the trades were invalid or criminal in some way. It's just any country that has a billion Euros syphoned off it will scream bloody murder.\"Solo Capital wasn't the only company now targeting Denmark. Others were getting in on the act. Jas believed it was only a matter of time before the house of cards came tumbling down.\"I was quite confident I'd done nothing wrong, but I knew if this carried on and blew up in spectacular style, I was going to get pulled in,\" he explains.With that in mind, in 2015, he decided to blow the whistle.He contacted a Danish lawyer, who in turn put him in touch with the Danish police. He went on to spend two and a half years assisting them with understanding how the cum-ex scam worked.Danish prosecutors did not target Mr Bains. Their attention was focused firmly on Mr Shah. The 54-year-old was eventually extradited from Dubai to face fraud charges – and in December last year was sentenced to 12 years in jail.It was the heaviest penalty ever handed out in Denmark for a fraud case. He is currently appealing.'Impossible to get a job'But when the Danish tax authority, Skatteforvaltningen (Skat), launched its huge case, seeking to recover its lost money, Mr Bains was one of the more than 100 individual and corporate defendants initially targeted - alongside Mr Shah.With that lawsuit hanging over him it became out of the question for him to work as a lawyer, or to get a role in the City of London. \"It's impossible to get a job if you're being sued as part of a two billion dollar international tax fraud case,\" he says.However, in October, High court judge Mr Justice Andrew Baker threw out Skat's claims.Acknowledging that \"greed can be a powerful motive, and I consider there was substantial greed here\", he nevertheless concluded that Skat has failed to prove it was a victim of deception.The authority's \"controls for assessing and paying dividend tax refund claims were so flimsy as to be non-existent,\" he said.That seemed to echo a statement previously made by Mr Shah in a 2021 German TV interview, which was also cited in the ruling:\"Why would they pay out for years and years and then, after four years of payments they say, 'Oh, we made a mistake, or we were cheated'\", he said.\"If there's a big sign on the street saying 'please help yourself', then me or somebody else would go and help themselves.\"There may still be an appeal. But for Mr Bains, the ruling provided some much-needed closure – and, he says, a chance to move on.",

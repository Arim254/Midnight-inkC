    "body": "1 hour agoRushdi Abualouf,Gaza correspondent, in Istanbul and David GrittenAt least 25 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip, the Hamas-run health ministry has said. Ten people, including a woman and a young girl, were killed when a ministry of religious endowments building in the eastern Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City was hit, according to rescuers.The Israeli military said it had struck \"Hamas terrorist targets\" after it said gunmen had opened fire towards an area where its soldiers were operating in the southern city of Khan Younis, in violation of the five-week-old ceasefire agreement.There was no immediate comment from Hamas.The flare-up of violence comes after the UN Security Council passed a resolution that endorsed US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan to end two years of devastating war.Mahmoud Bassal, a spokesman for Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency, told the BBC that Israeli air, drone and artillery strikes hit several locations in Gaza City and Khan Younis shortly after sunset on Wednesday.The attacks marked a sharp escalation after several days of relative calm, he said.The Civil Defence reported that the strike in Zeitoun caused severe damage to the religious endowments ministry's building and surrounding structures, and posted a video showing its rescue workers appearing to find two people buried under rubble.Photos published by the Anadolu news agency meanwhile showed the bodies of three young children reportedly recovered from the scene.In a separate incident in Gaza City, one person was killed and several others were wounded when a drone struck a group of people at Shejaiya junction on Salah al-Din Street, Gaza's main north-south road, according to Mr Bassal.He said another person was killed when a tank shell struck a house belonging to the Balboul family in Shejaiya's Mushtaha Street, which is also in eastern Gaza City.In Khan Younis, three people were killed and a number were wounded in a strike on a group inside a sports club run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), he added.In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that \"several terrorists opened fire toward the area where IDF soldiers are operating in Khan Younis\" earlier on Wednesday.\"This action constitutes a violation of the ceasefire agreement. No IDF injuries were reported,\" it added. \"In response, the IDF began striking Hamas terrorist targets across the Gaza Strip.\"Israeli public broadcaster Kan cited a security source as saying the targets of the strikes were the commander of the Zeitoun Battalion of Hamas's military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, and the commander of its naval force.On Monday, the UN Security Council passed a resolution that sought to shore up the fragile ceasefire, which took effect on 10 October.Member states authorised the creation of a transitional governance body called the Board of Peace, which will be chaired by President Trump, and a temporary International Stabilisation Force (ISF), which will be tasked with ensuring \"the process of demilitarizing the Gaza Strip\".Trump hailed the resolution as \"a moment of true historic proportion\".A Hamas statement reiterated that the group would not give up its weapons without a Palestinian state, arguing its fight against Israel was legitimate \"resistance\".Israel's ambassador to the UN stressed the importance of disarmament, saying that his country would \"not stop or let up\" until Hamas no longer presented \"a threat\".The Israeli military launched an offensive in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 69,500 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, including 280 during the ceasefire, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "A portrait by the Austrian artist Gustav Klimt was sold for $236.4m (£179m) in New York on Tuesday, making it the second most expensive piece ever sold at auction. Six people took part in a 20-minute bidding battle for the Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer which was painted between 1914 and 1916. Auction house Sotheby's has not disclosed the buyer's identity.The portrait was looted by the Nazis and almost destroyed in a fire in World War Two, but was rescued in 1948. The artwork was returned to Lederer's brother, Erich, a friend and subject of Klimt's contemporary, Egon Schiele. The piece remained in Lederer's possession for most of his life, before he sold it in 1983, according to Sotheby's. The painting shows Lederer, an heiress and the daughter of one of Klimt's patrons, wearing a white robe and standing in front of a blue tapestry covered in Asian motifs. The Nazis, who annexed Austria in 1938, looted the Lederer art collection but left family portraits behind, says the National Gallery of Canada. Estée Lauder heir Leonard A Lauder made it part of his private collection in 1985, where it was displayed in his Fifth Avenue home in New York. Tuesday's sale shot past expectations, with the painting predicted to sell for  $150m before the auction. The second highest sale for a Klimt on record was Lady with a Fan, which sold for $108.8m in 2023 in London. Several other Klimt works in Lauder's collection were auctioned at the same event, including Flowering Meadow and Forest Slope at Unterach am Attersee, which fetched between $60m and $80m each. The most expensive artwork ever sold at auction was Salvator Mundi, attributed to  Leonardo da Vinci, which sold in 2017 for $450.3m.Tuesday also saw a sculpture of a fully functioning gold toilet by the conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan picking up $12.1m just an hour after the record-breaking Klimt sale.The 101-kg toilet received just one bid. Sotheby's said that the buyer was a famous American brand.",

    "body": "Former US treasury secretary Larry Summers is stepping down from the board at OpenAI, a week after a tranche of emails between him and late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was released. Summers said in a statement to the BBC that he was \"grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company, and look forward to following their progress\".Summers, who was also once the president of Harvard University, said on Monday that he would be stepping back from public commitments over his ties to Epstein. The recently released emails showed Summers communicated with Epstein until the day before Epstein's 2019 arrest for the alleged sex trafficking of minors.In a statement, the artificial intelligence company said it respected Summers' decision to resign. \"We appreciate his many contributions and the perspective he brought to the Board,\" OpenAI said. The news comes after both chambers of Congress agreed on Tuesday to pass a measure to require the US justice department to release its files on Epstein. The measure will then head to the desk of US President Donald Trump for approval. He has said he plans to sign the bill, after reversing his position on the issue following pushback from his supporters. A batch of Epstein-related emails released by the House Oversight Committee last week mentioned a number of high-profile figures in the financier's former circle, without indicating any legal wrongdoing by those figures.The emails indicated that Summers and Epstein dined together frequently, with Epstein often trying to connect Summers to prominent global figures. After the emails were shared with the public, Summers said he took \"full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein\". He added that he wanted \"to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me\".Summers held senior posts under two Democratic presidents; serving as treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, and as director of the National Economic Council under Barack Obama. He led Harvard from 2001 to 2006 and remains a professor there. When announcing his step-down from public commitments earlier on Monday, he said he would continue his teaching commitments.Following Summers' announcement on Monday, the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington where Summers was a senior fellow, confirmed that Summers was no longer affiliated with the organisation.Summers joined the board of OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, in 2023 - following a failed attempt to oust its chief executive Sam Altman.

    "body": "3 hours agoDearbail Jordan and Simon AtkinsonYounger Australian teenagers on Instagram, Facebook and Threads are being told their accounts will be shut down ahead of the country's social media ban for under-16s.Meta, which owns the three brands, said it had begun notifying users it believes to be between 13 and 15 years old by text, email and in-app messages that their accounts would start being deactivated from 4 December.The ban in Australia comes into force on 10 December. It affects a number of platforms which also include TikTok, YouTube, X and Reddit.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the \"world-leading\" ban was aimed at \"letting kids be kids\". Meta and other firms oppose the measure but said they would comply. Australia's internet regulator has estimated there are 150,000 Facebook users and 350,000 teens on Instagram in the 13-15 age bracket.From 4 December, children aged below 16 will not be able to create accounts on Meta's social media platforms. The company said it was asking young users to update their contact details so they could be notified when they became eligible to open an account. They can download and save their posts, videos and messages before their accounts are shut down.Meta said that teens who said they were old enough to use Instagram, Facebook and Threads could challenge the restriction by taking a \"video selfie\" to be used in facial age scans.They could also provide a driver's licence or other government issued-ID.All these verification methods were tested by the UK-based Age Check Certification Scheme (ACCS) earlier this year, in a report commissioned by the Australian state.While the ACCS said that all methods had their merits, it added: \"We did not find a single ubiquitous solution that would suit all use cases, nor did we find solutions that were guaranteed to be effective in all deployments.\"Social media platforms which fail to take \"reasonable steps\" to block under-16s face fines of up to A$50m (£25m). \"While we are working hard to remove all users who we understand to be under the age of 16 by 10 December, compliance with the law will be an ongoing and multi-layered process,\" Antigone Davis, vice-president and global head of safety at Meta, told Reuters Financial.Meta wants to see a law where under-16s have to get parental approval before they download a social media app. The firm told Australia's Seven News: \"Teens are resourceful, and may attempt to circumvent age assurance measures to access restricted services.\"But it said: \"We're committed to meeting our compliance obligations and are taking the necessary steps to comply with the law.\"Australia's e-Safety Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said the ban was aimed at proctecting teens \"from pressures and risks they can be exposed to while logged in to social media accounts\".In a move seemingly to avoid being included in the ban, gaming platform Roblox this week announced that children under 16 would be unable to chat to adult strangers.Mandatory age checks will be introduced for accounts using chat features, starting in December for Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, then the rest of the globe from January.The e-safety commissioner has published a list of which social media platforms will be impacted by the age ban.They are: FacebookInstagramKickRedditSnapchatThreadsTikTokX (formerly Twitter)YouTubePlatforms not included are:DiscordGitHubGoogle ClassroomLEGO PlayMessengerRobloxSteam and Steam ChatWhatsAppYouTube Kids",

    "description": "Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are meeting in Ankara on Wednesday, as the Ukrainian president said he wanted ",
    "body": "Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are meeting in Ankara on Wednesday, as the Ukrainian president said he wanted to \"intensify\" peace negotiations.\"Bringing the end of the war closer with all our might is Ukraine's top priority,\" Zelensky said, adding that efforts would also focus on resuming prisoner exchanges.It was unclear whether representatives from the US would join. Special envoy Steve Witkoff was rumoured to take part in the talks, but hours before the meeting was meant to take place his attendance had not been confirmed. Turkey has maintained ties with both Kyiv and Moscow and has previously hosted talks between the two factions.But no Russian representative is set to join the meeting in Ankara, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday.He added that while there were \"no concrete plans\" for Vladimir Putin to speak to either the Turkish side or to US special envoy Steve Witkoff, the Russian president was \"of course open to a conversation\".Ankara will be the fourth capital Zelensky visits in only a few days. In Athens he secured a gas deal, in Paris he signed an agreement to obtain up to 100 fighter jets and in Madrid he held talks on co-operation with Spanish arms manufacturers.The visits are part of Zelensky's mission to try to shore up European support for Ukraine while Russian attacks on the country intensify and Moscow's troops close in on the key city eastern city of Pokrovsk.Domestically, Zelensky is facing the most serious crisis in years. Several members of his closest circle are under investigation for co-organising a large-scale criminal scheme, and two ministers have resigned. The scandal threatens to widen still and some EU leaders – who in December will decide whether to unblock a €140bn (£121bn) loan for Kyiv based on frozen Russian state assets – have warned Zelensky needs to do more to tackle corruption. As the fourth anniversary of the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 inches closer, Moscow and Kyiv remain fundamentally opposed in their views of how to end the war.Earlier in November Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russia's conditions for a peace deal had not changed since Putin laid them out in 2024.At the time, the Russian president demanded that Kyiv renounce any ambition to join Nato, as well as full Ukrainian withdrawal from the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.Zelensky has repeatedly argued that withdrawing from Donetsk and Luhansk – together known as the Donbas – would leave the rest of the country vulnerable to future attacks.Following a long meeting with Putin in April, Witkoff - the US special envoy - appeared to suggest that a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv hinged on the status of the contested Ukrainian regions as well as Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014. This stance led to tensions with Zelensky, who accused him of \"disseminating Russian narratives\". Zelensky and Witkoff have not met since early September. Although the summer saw a flurry of high-level talks and meetings - including between Trump and Putin - American efforts to bring a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine closer have stalled.At one point, it appeared Trump and Putin were about to meet again in Budapest –but that summit was scrapped, apparently after the US side became aware that Moscow had no intention of budging from several demands that were unacceptable to Kyiv.But contact between US and Russian officials has continued, albeit under the radar. Putin's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev was reportedly in Washington for meetings with Witkoff in late October, only days after Trump imposed sanctions on Russia's two biggest oil companies.",

    "body": "Nearly every Republican in the US House of Representatives voted on a bill  to compel the release of documents tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The lone \"nay\" came from the Republican lawmaker from Louisiana, Clay Higgins, who defied his party saying his vote was a principled \"NO\".\"What was wrong with the bill three months ago is still wrong today,\" Higgins wrote on X. \"It abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure in America.\"The resounding vote in favour of the Epstein bill, 427-1, marks a rare moment of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill. Hours later, the US senate too approved the legislation, clearing the way for the final act - President Donald Trump's signature. For Higgins, safeguarding the personal information of Epstein's many victims was the primary issue with the legislation.\"As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people – witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc,\" he wrote on X. \"If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt.\"  Higgins said he would support the bill if it were to be amended by the Senate, which Republican majority leader John Thune had already suggested was unlikely. \"When a bill comes out of the House 427 to 1 and the president said he's going to sign it, I'm not sure that amending it is in the cards,\" Thune said before the Senate's unanimous approval for the bill on Tuesday.Prior to the House passing the legislation, only four Republicans had joined all Democrats in signing a petition to force a vote - Thomas Massie, Lauren Boebert, Nancy Mace and Marjorie Taylor Greene.But it achieved overwhelming Republican support after President Trump dropped his opposition to a vote.Higgins has represented Louisiana's third district since 2017 and is widely regarded as one of the most conservative members of Congress, according to his website.His holdout vote in the wake of 200-plus members of his party voting otherwise is not the first time he has taken an unorthodox stance.In 2024, House Republicans voted to censure Higgins for offensive remarks he made on social media after he called Haiti \"the nastiest country in the western hemisphere\" and referred to Haitians as \"eating pets\" and \"slapstick gangsters\". \"All these thugs better get their mind right and their ass out of our country before January 20th,\" Higgins wrote.Facebook removed two posts from Higgins in 2020, after he wrote he would \"drop any 10 of you where you stand\", referring to any armed protesters that might attend a Louisiana demonstration against police brutality.Facebook told Business Insider at the time the posts \"were removed for violating our policies against inciting violence\". Before Congress, Higgins was a member of Louisiana's St Landry's Parish Sheriff's Office. He resigned in 2016 amid backlash about a controversial anti-crime video where he was seen holding a rifle and making threats against gang members. The BBC has contacted Higgins's office for comment.

It said fewer than 30 Palestinians died in Israeli custody in the 10 years prior.The Israel Prison Service (IPS) told the BBC it \"operates in accordance with the law and under the supervision of official oversight bodies\".It said it did not comment on figures or allegations from outside bodies.\"All inmates are held according to legal procedures, and their rights including access to medical care, hygiene, and adequate living conditions are upheld by professionally trained staff,\" the IPS added.Since 7 October 2023, thousands of Palestinians have been detained across Gaza and the West Bank, many without charge.PHRI said it had exposed a deeply concerning pattern of systematic human rights violations committed against Palestinians detained by Israel and classified as \"security prisoners\".It said this was carried out as part of an official policy implemented by Israeli authorities since the war began.Israeli authorities have stopped providing information about Palestinians in custody to the Red Cross and barred access to detention facilities.PHRI said its report is based on official records and data cross-referenced with forensic reports, information from other human rights groups and efforts to locate specific people, as well as testimony from detainees, their families and lawyers.Its authors say 52 of those who died were being held in military prisons while 42 died in civilian jails run by the IPS.PHRI says the deaths were caused by physical violence, medical neglect, or both.It singles out the policies of Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel's right-wing national security minister and a key member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government.PHRI said that, under Ben-Gvir's control, Israel's incarceration facilities holding Palestinians had \"effectively been transformed into sites of torture and abuse\".It added daily physical violence was widespread, and that the deprivation of human rights and systematic torture had resulted in the deaths of dozens of Palestinians.The highest number of deaths, 29, occurred at the Sde Teiman military prison in Southern Israel, near Gaza.Five Israeli reservist soldiers have been charged with aggravated abuse and causing serious bodily harm, after a Palestinian prisoner was allegedly beaten and stabbed in the rectum with a sharp object at Sde Teiman in July 2024.Footage emerged showing reserve soldiers taking a detainee aside and surrounding him with riot shields before he was allegedly attacked. The five reservists deny the charges and have not been named.The alleged assault has divided the nation, with some right-wing politicians criticising a military police investigation and even some \"right to rape\" protests outside the jail.The PHRI report accuses the Israeli authorities of trying to \"cover up\" and suppress investigations into Palestinian deaths and alleged abuses in custody.In said that, in many cases, detainees' family members were not notified that their relatives had died and access to post-mortems was denied.The report also said there had been a failure to prosecute Israeli prison staff and soldiers.It examined a policy of what it called \"forced disappearance\", through which thousands of Palestinians have been detained without their families being notified or told where their relatives are being held.PHRI said these \"grave violations of international law\" had made determining the full scope of Israel's prisoner policy and the fate of the many Palestinians taken into custody extremely difficult, if not impossible.The group estimates the actual number of Palestinians killed could be higher than the number it has been able to document.The IPS said \"the claims described do not reflect the conduct or procedures of the Israel Prison Service, and we are not aware of the incidents as presented\".It continued: \"Every death in IPS custody is examined in accordance with established procedures and referred to the competent authorities as required.\"For reasons of privacy, security, and legal limitations, the IPS does not provide personal or statistical details regarding inmates, nor does it comment on individual cases.\"The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it operates \"in accordance with Israeli and international law\", and \"detains individuals in Gaza when there is reasonable suspicion of their involvement in terrorist activities\".It said that, in some cases, criminal proceedings were then initiated, while in others \"preventive detention is enforced to remove individuals from the fighting, in full alignment with the Israeli law and the Geneva Conventions\". \"Detention orders and their duration are subject to judicial review as required by law,\" it added.The IDF said it was aware of incidents of detainees dying in custody, but that these included people detained with existing illness or injury, adding each death was investigated by military police.",

    "body": "20 hours agoRaghvendra RaoBBC Hindi, BiharSeraj AliLalmunni Devi, who lost her husband to toxic liquor in 2022, says alcohol abuse upended her lifeNine years after imposing a statewide alcohol ban to curb addiction, domestic violence, and financial ruin among its poorest families, Bihar - India's poorest state - still struggles to gauge the policy's effectiveness.The gaps in implementation became glaring as the BBC shadowed Bihar officials in a misty October morning raid on bootleggers.Armed excise officers, with a sniffer dog, sped across the Ganges on a boat to raid an illegal distillery.On reaching the outskirts of the capital, Patna, the team found a ramshackle setup of a dozen metal drums - part of a makeshift apparatus fermenting jaggery, a type of cane sugar, into country liquor.Vapour rose from the drums embedded in the riverside mud, the surfaces still warm.The officers said the site was active minutes earlier, but the alcohol-makers had fled by the time they arrived. \"They often get tipped off before a raid,\" an officer who didn't wish to be named said. Despite these enforcement gaps, alcohol prohibition remains firmly in place in Bihar.Passed in 2016 by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar after persistent demands from women's groups, the law was among the factors that helped his Janata Dal (United) - Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alliance clinch a decisive state election victory earlier this month.State officials tout the policy's success by pointing to big numbers: since the law took effect, 1.1 million cases have been registered and 650,000 people convicted for violations. But the devil lies in the detail.More than 99% of these convictions are for consumption, rather than production, selling, or transport of illicit liquor. Moreover, alcohol remains widely available in the black market in Bihar. In the six weeks leading to the recently held election, illicit alcohol worth more than 522 million rupees ($6.26 million, £4.96 million) was seized from across the state. Seraj AliA makeshift setup of metal drums fermenting jaggery into country liquorSo why has Bihar been unable to enforce its ban more effectively?Local police, who did not want to come on record, say it is a combination of several factors - including staff shortages, increasingly sophisticated smuggling methods and possible collusion between liquor makers and authorities.\"There are laws that prescribe life imprisonment or even the death penalty for murder. But does that stop people from committing murder? No, it doesn't,\" said Ratnesh Sada, an outgoing minister whose department handled prohibition issues.Mr Sada, however, insisted that action has been taken against at least a hundred individuals engaged in illegal alcohol trade, with their properties seized.\"We destroy these setups, but within days they are up and running again,\" said Sunil Kumar, an excise official.Bihar's geography makes enforcement even harder. The landlocked state borders Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and West Bengal -  all of which allow alcohol and serve as major sources of smuggled liquor. It also shares a 726km (449 mile), largely porous border with Nepal, which officials say has become a key conduit for alcohol smuggling, further complicating enforcement.Seraj AliBihar has a thriving black market in locally-brewed alcoholDespite the challenges, many women in Bihar -  who still carry deep scars from their husbands' alcohol abuse -  want the ban to continue.In Chhapra district, Lalmunni Devi, who lost her husband after he consumed toxic liquor in 2022, said her life had been upended by alcohol abuse.\"I just hope no one else has to suffer the same fate,\" she said.Neetu Devi, another widow, broke down as she recalled her husband's death.\"If the government were to shut down all such factories entirely, it [liquor] would no longer be available. It continues to be produced, and that's why people keep consuming it,\" she said.Rajeev Kamal Kumar, an anthropologist at Patna's AN Sinha Institute of Social Sciences, who worked on a government study of prohibition, says both sides of the story are true.\"Many women and elders say prohibition has improved household finances, children's education, and nutrition. But it is undeniable that illegal trade continues,\" he said.Bihar is neither the first nor the only Indian state to impose prohibition; several others have tried it over the years. But such measures often trigger unintended consequences - from thriving black markets and deaths from illicit brews, to enforcement challenges that drain state resources.The financial cost has also been considerable, as alcohol taxes remain a key source of revenue for many state governments.Gujarat and Nagaland have had bans since 1960 and 1989, yet both still grapple with bootlegging.Mizoram imposed prohibition in 1997, lifted it in 2015, reinstated it in 2019, and then relaxed it again in 2022 to allow the manufacture, sale and export of wine made from local grapes.Some other states have rolled back prohibition after encountering economic and administrative challenges.For now, with the outgoing government slated to return to power, prohibition will remain in Bihar. But the policy remains a paradox - hailed as a social reform by some, criticised as ineffective by others.Whether it has succeeded or merely shifted the problem underground is a question that continues to haunt the state.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "3 hours agoHugh SchofieldParisNICOLAS TUCAT/AFP via Getty ImagesAmine Kessaci was 17 when his first brother was killed - now he has lost anotherA prominent French anti-drugs campaigner whose brother was killed by drugs criminals last week,  five years after the murder of his elder brother, has vowed to stand up to intimidation and \"keep telling the truth about drugs violence\".Amine Kessaci, 22, was writing in Le Monde newspaper a day after the funeral of his younger brother Mehdi, whose murder last week has been described by the government as a turning-point in France's drugs wars.\"Yesterday I lost my brother. Today I speak out,\" he wrote in his opinion piece.\"[The drugs-traffickers] strike at us in order to break, to tame, to subdue. They want to wipe out any resistance, to break any free spirit, to kill in the egg any embryo of revolt.\"Mehdi Kessaci, 20, was shot dead last Wednesday as he parked his car in central Marseille in what appears to have been a warning or punishment aimed at his older brother, Amine, from the city's drugs gangs.Speaking after a ministerial meeting on drugs crime at the Elysée palace on Tuesday, Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said: \"We all agreed that this premeditated murder was something totally new. It's clearly a crime of intimidation. It's a new level of violence.\"Mehdi was the second Kessaci brother to be killed by drugs criminals. In 2020 the body of Brahim Kessaci, then 22, was found in a burnt-out car. That murder prompted Amine to launch his association, Conscience, which aims to expose the damage to working-class communities caused by gangs.Marseille is renowned for worsening drugs wars, and Amine Kessaci recently wrote a book called Marseille Wipe your Tears – Life and Death in a Land of Drugs.AFP via Getty ImagesMehdi Kessaci, giving an interview last year at an event for his brotherIn his Le Monde article, Amine revealed he was recently warned by police to leave Marseille because of threats to his life. He attended his younger brother's funeral wearing a bullet-proof jacket and under heavy police protection.\"I speak because I have no choice but to fight if I don't want to die. I speak because I know that silence is the refuge of our enemies,\" he wrote, urging courage from citizens, and action from the government.Mehdi Kessaci's murder has brought the national spotlight back on a drugs trafficking problem that French experts and ministers agree is reaching almost unmanageable proportions.According to Senate member Étienne Blanc, author of a recent study, turnover in the drugs trade in France is now €7bn (£6bn) – or 70% of the entire budget of the justice ministry.He said around 250,000 people drew a living from the trade in France – more than the entire number of police and gendarmes, which is 230,000. According to Le Monde, the country counts 1.1 million users of cocaine.President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday launched a broadside against such consumers, telling the weekly cabinet meeting that \"sometimes it is the city-centre bourgeoisie that is funding the traffickers\".Macron had called a special drugs summit the day before in response to Amine's murder and in order to review progress on a new anti-drugs law that was passed in June.It sets up a special prosecutor's office dedicated to organised crime - similar to the office that tackles terrorism - which will eventually have 30 specialised magistrates.Under the law, senior drugs convicts are made to serve their terms in isolation in a specially converted prison where it is hoped it will be harder to continue running operations from behind bars.According to Laurent Nuñez, there is evidence that the crackdown on drugs crime is having an effect - with the number of homicides in Marseille down from 49 in 2023 to 24 in 2024. The number of dealing points in the city had halved from 160 to 80, he added.\"The war is not won, but we do have results.\"ALAIN JOCARD/AFP via Getty ImagesMembers of Parliament stand to pay tribute to Mehdi Kessaci on 13 NovemberAccording to the author of a recent book, Narcotraffic, Europe's poison, \"France is at the heart of the geopolitics of drugs. With its two major ports of Marseille and Le Havre, it has an ideal geographical position in this Europe of free movement.\"Mathieu Verboud said that the growth in world production of cocaine had triggered an \"explosion of supply and demand. The market has gone through the roof and so have the profits.\"The sheer wealth of drugs organisations meant they had the power to corrupt everyone from dock-workers to local politicians, the author warned, a process he said was already well-advanced in countries like the Netherlands and Belgium.Several French politicians have said it is time to call in the army to deal with drugs-trafficking and the gangs which hold sway in many high-immigration city estates.Christian Estrosi, mayor of the southern coastal city of Nice, said: \"Narcotrafficking has transformed into narcoterrorism. Its aim now is to terrorise, subjugate and rule.\"We have already successfully deployed the means to fight terrorism. It's time to act with determination against narcoterrorism.\"Estrosi was referring to wave of deadly jihadist attacks in the mid 2010s, when France deployed hundreds of soldiers on to the streets of many cities where they continue to patrol.",

    "body": "'I hated that I looked Asian': KPop Demon Hunters star on her struggle for acceptance2 days agoChi Chi Izundu & Rebecca ThornBBC Global WomenBBCArden Cho stars as the voice of Rumi in KPop Demon Hunters, which topped Netflix charts in 93 countries\"I hated that I looked Asian, that I didn't have blue eyes and blonde hair, because that's what was beautiful at the time,\" says Arden Cho, the actress who voiced Rumi, star of Netflix's chart-topping animated film, KPop Demon Hunters.Speaking to the BBC World Service for the Global Women series, Cho, 40, is describing her childhood in Texas, as the eldest daughter of Korean immigrant parents and her struggle for acceptance in American society.In the film, which tells the story of a female K-Pop trio who must save the world from evil forces, Rumi has to come to terms with her identity as part human, part demon - and when Cho first read the script this resonated powerfully.\"Being born in America, feeling American but having people treat me like I'm not, trying to figure out my identity as an Asian-American, as a Korean-American, as a woman,\" she says.These were all elements of her early life that mirrored Rumi's journey.\"I can honestly say that at different points in my life, I hated a lot of myself and I wanted to be someone else.\"As kids, what you see shapes who you become and I feel like I just didn't see enough people that look like me.\"NetflixCho says the film has led to \"Korea being loved\" more than ever beforeWhen it launched on Netflix in June, KPop Demon Hunters registered 33 million views in just two weeks, and reached the top 10 of the Netflix charts in 93 countries. To star in the first Hollywood animated film set in Korea, with Korean leads, was for Cho \"a dream come true\" – but it has also made her a powerful role model for Asian-American children, of the kind that she lacked when she was young.Cho says many Korean-Americans have told her it's \"such a refreshing moment\", making them proud for the first time of their dual heritage and culture.\"I feel like K-Pop really, truly, has paved the way. K-beauty has had such a big impact on Korea being loved. But I feel like this movie is the one that tipped it over the edge of, everybody wants to go to Korea, now,\" Cho says.But the film's success was not guaranteed and Cho says she felt the team making it were \"sometimes facing an uphill battle\".\"I feel like it kind of sucks to say this, but any time there's an Asian-led project, people feel like it's a risk,\" she says.So, when she took on the role, she made an effort to meet everyone working on the film in person, she says.Getty ImagesJi-Young Yoo (left) and May Hong (right) are also voice actors in the filmThe film was released against the backdrop of increased immigration raids in the US as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation effort, targeting those who are in the country illegally, which sparked protests in many states.As an Asian-American living in the US \"it's heartbreaking and disappointing,\" says Cho. \"Immigrants have made America what it is.\"Korean news sources have estimated that up to 150,000 Korean immigrants without proper documentation, including adopted children, are among those who could be deported.Cho says that when she was younger, people didn't know what it meant to be Korean in the USAs an adult, Cho came to realise that the racism she had experienced when she was younger stemmed mainly from a lack of education, as people didn't know what it meant to be Korean or Asian.\"But now in this day and age, when I feel like the world and people should know better, it is beyond disappointing and sometimes I feel like we feel so hopeless,\" she says.Because of this, it feels very special, she says, that KPop Demon Hunters could bring \"hope and joy and love to all these different communities\".\"Maybe that's why it's sort of like this movie of the summer, because we just needed some hope and something to unite us all together.\"The growth of AI is a major concern for the film industry, raising the possibility that in future it could be used to make a film like KPop Demon Hunters.Cho says she is aware that AI is already being used to replicate actors' voices, but wants to \"have hope in humanity\" that people will still seek out art created by humans.\"Sure, I'm sure they're going to have AI actors and singers. I know they already exist. I know our voices are already being manipulated, but I hope people have some respect and want and love for something real.\"KPop Demon Hunters has also been dominating the global music charts, with seven tracks from its soundtrack featured on the Billboard Hot 100. It has its own fan art, and audiences around the world are demanding a sequel.Cho tells us she wishes she could answer the question of whether that will happen - but both she and fans will have to wait for Netflix or Sony Pictures Entertainment, which made the film, to give it the green light.\"I know there's lots of murmurs, I've heard wonderful things,\" she says. \"So we shall see, and I think everyone in the world would riot if there wasn't.\"Starting conversations, building connections and challenging misinformation through features, investigations, interviews and extraordinary stories",

    "body": "Venezuela's Maduro 'ready to talk' as US ramps up pressure1 day agoVanessa BuschschlüterLatin America editor, BBC News Online'Face to face': Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro open to US talksVenezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro has said that he is willing to hold face-to-face talks with representatives of the Trump administration as US pressure on him grows.Maduro made the comment hours after US President Donald Trump said he had not ruled out deploying ground forces to the South American country.The Trump administration has accused Maduro - whose re-election last year was dismissed as rigged by many countries - of being the leader of a drugs cartel.Maduro has denied the allegation and accuses the US of trying to incite a war to gain control of Venezuela's oil reserves. Since Trump was sworn in to a second term in office in January, the US government has been increasing its pressure on Maduro.It has doubled the reward it offers for information leading to his capture to $50m (38m) and in August launched a counternarcotics operation targeting boats it accuses of transporting drugs from Venezuela to the US.More than 80 people have been killed in the US strikes on suspected vessels since, most of them in the Caribbean as well as some in the Pacific.According to US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, the aim of \"Operation Southern Spear\" is to remove \"narcoterrorists\" from the Western Hemisphere.But legal experts have questioned the legality of the strikes, pointing out that the US has provided no evidence that the boats were carrying drugs. It is also unclear how much of an impact the strikes are having on the wider flow of drugs, a significant portion of which cross the land border between Mexico and the US.The size of the US military deployment - which includes the US Navy's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford - has also led to speculation both in Venezuela and in the US that its real aim is to remove Maduro from power.Trump has been repeatedly asked by journalists about his government's plan and has given seemingly contradictory answers. Asked by US broadcaster CBS on 3 November whether the US was going to war with Venezuela, Trump said, \"I don't think so\".But on Sunday, when asked whether he would rule out US troops on the ground in Venezuela, he answered: \"No, I don't rule out that, I don't rule out anything.\"However, when pressed on whether he would speak to his Venezuelan counterpart directly, he said: \"I would probably talk to him, yeah.\"  \"I talk to everybody,\" Trump added. Also on Sunday, the US state department said it \"intended to designate Cartel de los Soles\", the Venezuelan drug trafficking gang it alleges is led by Maduro, as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO).But rather than doing so immediately, the state department said the move would become effective on 24 November. This delay - combined with Trump leaving the door open to direct talks - has been interpreted by some as a US ultimatum for Maduro: enter into negotiations or face even more draconian US measures.Being labelled as an FTO means it becomes illegal for US citizens to knowingly provide material support or resources to the group in question. According to the White House, it also then becomes the policy of the US to \"ensure the total elimination of these organisations' presence in the United States and their ability to threaten the territory, safety, and security of the United States\".Some analysts think that just as the Trump administration has argued that it is legal to target alleged drug boats in the Caribbean because of the danger they say they pose to US citizens, it could use the FTO designation to bolster support for strikes against the Cartel de los Soles on Venezuelan soil.In several of his recent public appearances, Maduro has addressed the US people directly, even speaking - and once even singing - in English. On Monday, he said \"dialogue, call, yes, peace, yes, war, no, never, never war\" and stressed that he was ready to talk \"face to face\" with anyone in the US \"who wants to talk to Venezuela\".Past attempts by various parties at negotiating with representatives of the Maduro government have failed. Talks between the Venezuelan opposition and the Maduro government mediated by Norway and held in Barbados broke down as did an earlier Vatican-backed effort at finding a way out of Venezuela's political crisis. While the US has been ratcheting up the pressure on Maduro, Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize Winner María Corina Machado has been trying to encourage the Venezuelan military to switch sides and turn on Maduro.Speaking and posting from an undisclosed location in Venezuela, where she has been hiding to escape arrest, Machado has long denounced the Maduro government as \"a criminal structure\" and called on Venezuelans to unite to depose it. On Tuesday, she uploaded what she called a \"freedom manifesto\" to social media in which she outlined her vision for a post-Maduro Venezuela. In it she states that \"we stand at the edge of a new era - one where our natural rights will prevail\" and argues that Maduro and his close allies need to be held accountable for \"crimes against humanity\", citing the mistreatment of political prisoners and detainees under his rule.

    "body": "Baby Shark: How a 90-second clip created a $400m business21 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesWhen Kim Min-seok gave the go-ahead in June 2016 to publish a 90-second clip of a children's song, he had no idea what he was unleashing.It became a global phenomenon, clocking up more than 16 billion views - YouTube's most watched video ever.That song was the incredibly catchy Baby Shark.Not only has it captivated toddlers and terrorised adults around the world, it laid the foundations for its creator Pinkfong to become a media business worth hundreds of millions of dollars.“We didn’t expect it to stand out from our other content,\" Mr Kim, Pinkfong's chief executive, told the BBC from the firm's headquarters in Seoul.\"But looking back, it became a major turning point that set the stage for our global journey.”Getty ImagesPinkfong chief executive Kim Min-seok at the firm's stock market listing ceremonyOn Tuesday, that journey took Pinkfong to the South Korean stock market, where its shares rose by more than 9% on their debut, giving it a valuation of more than $400m (£304m).'We didn't expect a salary' Founded in 2010 as SmartStudy, the firm made digital content for children up to 12 years of age. It had just three employees, including Mr Kim and the firm's chief technology officer, Dongwoo Son.\"The office was tiny - even smaller than this,\" recalled Mr Kim, gesturing to the conference room he was calling from.It was so small \"we didn't even expect a salary at the time\", he said through a translator.Getty ImagesThe firm was renamed Pinkfong after its cheerful and curious fox character in 2022Pinkfong went through several major overhauls, including shifting its focus to toddlers.The firm grew to around 100 employees and prioritised simpler, learning-based games and content. \"And that's when Baby Shark emerged,\" Mr Kim said.The firm has been known as The Pinkfong Company since 2022, a name inspired by a cheerful and curious fox that featured in one of its early cartoons.It now has around 340 employees, with offices in Tokyo, Shanghai and Los Angeles.The Baby Shark momentBaby Shark is believed to have originated in the US in the 1970s and was often sung at children's summer camps.The song, which repeats the phrase \"Baby shark, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo\" is \"attractive for children, though possibly annoying for adults,\" said media analyst Kevin Chew from the Nanyang Technological University. Mr Kim is also very aware of just how catchy it is.\"It's like a K-pop song. It's very fast-paced, rhythmical and it's addictive,\" he said, adding that the tune has a \"chanting\" effect, which makes it easy for children to remember.But it was not an instant hit and only gained traction when its dance routine was featured at children's events in South East Asia.Videos of children and adults dancing to the song started to spread online and the clip went viral.There was a \"festival-like feeling\" in the Pinkfong office, as the team watched its viewing numbers soar, Mr Kim said.In November 2020, the Baby Shark clip claimed the title of YouTube's most viewed.It generated around half of the firm's revenue in the years immediately after the video's release and became a springboard for new content and merchandise, he said.Baby Shark: It's got a catchy tune and plans for world domination - but the toddler hit is older than you thinkBut Pinkfong faced a legal challenge in 2019 when it was accused of plagiarising the work of an American composer.South Korea's Supreme Court rejected the case, after the company argued that its version was derived from a folk song in the public domain.The victory, Mr Kim said, gave the firm a lift as its shares went public. He added that the stock market application had been filed before the verdict was announced.One-hit wonder?Pinkfong's other franchises like Bebefinn and Sealook are growing fast but the firm must prove its success is not just reliant on Baby Shark, said Korea University business lecturer Min Jung Kim.The company's target audience is a major plus as toddlers tend to watch the same material repeatedly, she said. Kim Min-seok insists his business can grow beyond Baby Shark, which currently accounts for about a quarter of Pinkfong's revenue. Meanwhile, Bebefinn has leapt ahead, generating roughly 40% of the firm's earnings.One parent told the BBC that his family has mixed feelings about Pinkfong's videos.Father of two Saleem Nashef said he appreciates the educational qualities of the firm's content but his wife thinks Baby Shark is \"too over-stimulating for kids\". Still, the viral video is apparently inescapable, as his daughter, who is about to turn three, will have a Baby Shark-themed birthday party.Whether Pinkfong can create other characters to match Baby Shark's commercial appeal remains unclear, said Prof Kim.It raised almost $52m in its stock market debut and plans to use the money to expand its line-up of films and characters, said Mr Kim.The company also aims to become a \"tech-driven\" content creator, using viewing patterns and other data to shape its new projects.Pinkfong has already achieved \"what many creators have always dreamed of,\" Mr Kim said.But now it must show investors that it is not just a one-hit wonder.",

    "body": "2 days agoYolande Knell,Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem and Wahiba Ahmed,JerusalemBBCChildren and families will perish, warns Jan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee CouncilAid agencies have reiterated calls for Israel to allow more tents and urgently needed supplies into Gaza after the first heavy winter rainfall, saying more than a quarter of a million families need emergency help with shelters.\"We are going to lose lives this winter. Children, families will perish,\" says Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC).\"It's actually so frustrating that we've now lost so many crucial weeks since the adoption of the Trump peace plan, which said humanitarian aid would flow and the Palestinians would not needlessly continue to suffer.\"With a majority of the population displaced by two-years of a devastating war, most Gazans now live in tents - many of them makeshift.  They have been clearing up after widespread flooding due to a winter storm that began on Friday. There are fears that diseases could spread as rainwater has mixed with sewage water.\"My children are already sick and look at what happened to our tent,\" said Fatima Hamdona, crying in the rain over the weekend, as she showed a BBC freelance journalist the ankle-deep puddle inside her temporary home in Gaza City.\"We don't have food - the flour got all wet.  We're people who've been destroyed.  Where do we go? There's no shelter for us to go to now.\"Fatima Hamdona (pictured) says her family's food perished in the rainThe story was the same in the southern city of Khan Younis.\"Our clothes, mattresses and blankets were flooded,\" said Nihad Shabat, as she tried to dry out her possessions there on Monday.  Her family has been sleeping inside a shelter made of sheets and blankets.  \"We're worried about getting flooded again. We cannot afford to buy a tent.\"A recent UN report found that across Gaza more than 80% of buildings had been destroyed and 92% in Gaza City.According to the NRC - which has long led the so-called Shelter Cluster in Gaza, made up of some 20 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) - about 260,000 Palestinian families, or about 1.5 million people, are in need of emergency shelter assistance, lacking the basics to get through winter.The NGOs say they have been able to get only about 19,000 tents into Gaza since the US-brokered Israel-Hamas ceasefire took effect on 10 October.  They say they have 4,000 pallets of aid - containing non-food items, including tents and bedding - blocked from entering.  Supplies that have been bought are currently stuck in Egypt, Jordan and Israel.Jan Egeland blames what he calls \"a bureaucratic, military, politicised quagmire\" running \"counter to all humanitarian principles\" for the hold-up. In March, Israel introduced a new registration process for aid groups working in Gaza, citing security reasons.  It requires that they give lists of their local Palestinian staff.  However, aid groups say that data protection laws in donor countries prevent them from handing over such information.Many tents have fallen to pieces, leaving displaced Palestinians without proper shelterMany items, including tent poles, are also classed as \"dual-use\" by Israel, meaning they have a military as well as civilian purpose, and their entry is banned or heavily restricted.Cogat, the Israeli defence body that controls the border crossings, told the BBC that \"over the last few months\" it had coordinated the entry of \"close to 190,000 tents and tarpaulins directly to the residents of the Gaza Strip\". It said that \"in accordance with the terms of the agreement\" of the ceasefire, it was allowing \"hundreds of trucks carrying food, water, fuel, gas, medicines, medical equipment, tents, and shelter supplies [to] enter the Gaza Strip every day, in coordination with the UN, international organizations, donor countries, and the private sector\". On Sunday, Cogat wrote on X: \"We call on international organizations to coordinate more tents and tarpaulins and other winter humanitarian responses.\"It said it was working with the new US-led Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) that had been set up in southern Israel and other international partners to plan \"a catered humanitarian response for the upcoming winter\".International aid groups are hoping that the CMCC - which will oversee implementation of President Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan - will help ease restrictions on their work.With a foreign donor conference on reconstruction in the Palestinian territory expected to take place in Egypt soon, they say basic shelter supplies must be allowed to enter while longer-term plans are developed.\"It would not be a good thing if all these nations meet in Cairo to discuss long-term reconstruction for Palestinians in great need if they die before their high-rise buildings can be reconstructed,\" says Mr Egeland, who was previously the UN's Emergency Relief Coordinator.  \"They need a tent today, they don't need a promise of a beachfront structure in five years.\"Displaced Palestinians have nowhere else to go after so much of Gaza was devastated in the warPalestinians have told the BBC that many tents - brought in by international agencies and Gulf donors - have been stolen and are available on the black market in Gaza.They say that with a small increase in supply, prices have dropped from about $2,700 (2,330 euros; £2,050) before the ceasefire, to around $900-$1,000.There are pleas for international help to distribute more shelters, more fairly.\"I hope everyone will join with us to end this crisis we're living through,\" says Alaa al-Dirghali in Khan Younis.  \"The tents endured two years under the sun and two years under the rain and they couldn't last this downpour.\"\"Until this moment, people are re-erecting these broken tents because they don't have any alternative.  I pray to God that those responsible for handing out tents will give them to those who actually need them.  They're getting stolen and sold to people at a very expensive price.\"\"When the rain came, the tents couldn't protect us,\" says Rami Deif AllahIn Gaza City, Rami Deif Allah, who was displaced from Beit Hanoun, was drying out soaked mattresses in the weak sunshine, with his elderly mother and children.He said a relative had given him a waterproof tent but that it was still flooded.\"We evacuated about 11 times and there was no safe place for us so we took shelter in these humble tents but it was all in vain. When the rain came they couldn't protect us,\" he said. \"The water flooded us from above and below.\"Like all Gazans, Rami longs for a permanent dwelling.\"We pray for this war to be fully over, and for everyone to return to their homes,\" he went on.  \"Even if we don't find our houses standing, with our sweat and blood we will rebuild. This situation of living out on the streets is unbearable.\"Correction 18 November 2025: An earlier version of this article mistakenly said NGO said 44,000 pallets of aid were being blocked from entering Gaza. The correct figure is 4,000.",

Quiet, piggy.\"The exchange occurred as calls grew for the US Department of Justice to release files related to its investigation into Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender who died in prison in 2019.On Sunday, President Trump reversed his position and called for Republicans to vote for a bill that forces the Justice Department to release all of its files related to the Epstein case.",

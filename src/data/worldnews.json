    "body": "<div><p>Fifa has accused Malaysia of falsifying citizenship documents so<b> </b>seven foreign-born players could play for the national team.</p><p>Football's world governing body had fined and suspended the players in late September and on Monday released a report justifying its action.</p><p>Fifa said the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) had forged birth certificates to make it look like the players' grandparents were born in Malaysia. This, the body said, \"constitutes, pure and simple, a form of cheating\".</p><p>But FAM said the discrepancies arose from an \"administrative error\" and that it would appeal Fifa's penalties. It maintained that the players were \"legitimate Malaysian citizens\".</p></div><div><p>Fifa's \"grandfather rule\" allows foreign-born football players to represent countries that their biological parents or grandparents were born in. This aims to prevent national football teams from simply importing foreign players to boost performance.</p><p>Fifa investigated the players following Malaysia's 4-0 win against Vietnam in June, in response to questions about their eligibility.</p><p>In September, the Fifa disciplinary committee suspended the seven players<b> </b>for a year and ordered them to pay a fine of 2,000 Swiss francs ($2,500; £1,870). At the time, Fifa did not share details about the reason for their suspension, only that it related to \"doctored documentation\".</p><p>The football governing<b> </b>body ordered FAM to pay 350,000 Swiss francs ($440,000; £330,000).</p><p>In recent years, South East Asian countries have launched recruitment drives for naturalised players, hoping to emulate Indonesia's strategy of recruiting Dutch-born footballers from the Indonesian diaspora.</p><p>Earlier this year, FAM sent Fifa birth certificates showing that the grandparents of its seven players had been<b> </b>born in Malaysian cities like Penang and Malacca. </p><p>But Fifa said investigators obtained original birth certificates of the grandparents, which showed that they were born in countries like Argentina and Spain - all corresponding with the players' birthplaces.</p><p>The seven players include Spanish-born Gabriel Felipe Arrocha, Facundo Tomas Garces and Jon Irazabal Iraurgui, Argentinian-born Rodrigo Julian Holgado and Imanol Javier Machuca, Netherlands-born Hector Alejandro Hevel Serrano and Brazilian-born Joao Vitor Brandao Figueiredo.</p><p>Malaysia's sports minister Hannah Yeoh said Fifa's findings had tarnished the country's image. She said the ministry would wait for FAM's appeal to be over before making any official statement. </p><p>\"I also understand that all local football fans are naturally angry, disappointed and want to see improvements,\" she told a news conference on Tuesday, according to government news agency Bernama.</p><p>Malaysia is set to play against Laos in another Asian Cup qualifier this week - though the Malaysian team's line-up will look much different without the sanctioned players.</p></div>",

Paramount declined to comment on reports that the firm had paid $150m in stock and cash. </p><p>Mr Ellison, the founder and CEO of Skydance Media, made his name as a Hollywood film producer of blockbusters such as Top Gun Maverick, True Grit and World War Z. </p><p>He has said his aim was to produce coverage that was less politically skewed, and therefore had the ability to reach all audiences. </p><p>His takeover of Paramount was approved by the Trump administration this summer, after the company agreed to pay $16m to settle a lawsuit brought by Trump over a 60 Minutes interview with his 2024 presidential rival Kamala Harris he said was deceptively edited to benefit Democrats. </p><p>To win approval of the deal, Mr Ellison agreed to install an independent ombudsman at CBS to review complaints of bias and committed to regulators that programming would reflect a diversity of view points. </p><p>He also said CBS's long-running political show \"Face the Nation\" would no longer air edited interviews. </p></div><div><p>CBS News has a partnership agreement with the BBC, meaning news content including video footage can be shared. BBC News is editorially independent of CBS.</p><p>In a note announcing the deal, Ms Weiss said she believed in the Paramount boss and his leadership team.</p><p>\"They are doubling down because they believe in news. Because they have courage. Because they love this country. And because they understand, as we do, that America cannot thrive without common facts, common truths, and a common reality,\" she wrote. </p></div></article>",

France's budget deficit is projected to hit 5.4% of economic output (GDP) this year.</p><p>Last month, François Bayrou resigned after losing a confidence vote in the French parliament when he tried to push through swingeing budget cuts. Now Lecornu, his successor, has resigned after only 26 days in the job, blaming \"partisan appetites\" among coalition parties.</p><p>Lecornu began talks with political leaders from the centre ground on Tuesday morning, in an attempt to find a way out of the impasse. Philippe said he would take part in the talks, although Bruno Retailleau, from the right-wing Republicans, said he would only meet Lecornu one-to-one.</p><p>\"It's clear we're today in the middle of a political crisis that dismays and worries our fellow citizens,\" Philippe told RTL radio. \"This political crisis is bringing the state into decline... the authority and continuity of the state aren't being respected.\"</p><p>Philippe, whose Horizons party has been part of Macron's government throughout his second presidential term, rejected calls from political opponents for the president's immediate resignation - but said it was up to Macron himself to find a solution.</p><p>\"[Immediate resignation] would have a terrible impact and would prevent a presidential election taking place under good conditions,\" he told RTL on Tuesday.</p><p>However, he argued Macron should avert the crisis by naming a prime minister who could put through a budget, guarantee the continued workings of the state, and leave in an \"orderly and dignified manner\".</p><p>\"When you're head of state, you don't use the institutions, you serve them - and he should serve the institutions by finding a solution to this political crisis.\"</p><p>Macron's poll ratings have nose-dived in recent months and one survey of 1,000 French people conducted for newspaper Le Figaro suggested that 53% of them thought he should stand down.</p><p>Meanwhile, a van burst into flames on the same street as the prime minister's residence on the Rue de Varenne on Tuesday morning, in what commentators suggested was symbolic of the continuing political crisis.</p></div>",

Trump said on social media they had a \"very good telephone call\".</p><p>It is the first time the two have spoken formally since they had a brief encounter at the United Nations General Assembly in New York last month.</p><p>Relations had been icy since Trump raised tariffs this summer to 50% on some Brazilian goods in response to the trial of Lula's predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c147n38k800o\">who was found guilty</a> of plotting a military coup.</p></div><div><p>Lula had accused Trump of foreign interference and behaving like an \"emperor\".</p><p>But on Monday, the Brazilian government said the two leaders spoke in a \"friendly tone\" for half an hour and \"reminisced about the good chemistry\" they had in New York.</p><p>Lula described the meeting as an opportunity to \"restore\" friendly relations between \"the two largest Western democracies\" and reiterated that the US had a trade surplus with Brazil. </p><p>He requested that tariffs be reduced to their original 10% and for sanctions on some Brazilian officials be removed.</p><p>The two exchanged phone numbers to keep in touch directly.</p><p>Trump said on his Truth Social platform: \"It [the call] was mostly focused on the economy, and trade, between our two countries. </p><p>\"We will be having further discussions, and will get together in the not too distant future, both in Brazil and the United States.\"</p><p>Brazilian Vice-President Geraldo Alckmin described the call as \"better than expected\", and said he was optimistic about talks between the two countries.</p><p>Lula invited Trump to next month's UN climate summit in Belém, Brazil, suggested meeting during the Asean summit in Malaysia, and offered to travel to the US.</p><p>Trump has appointed US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to continue negotiations with Brazil's vice-president, foreign minister and finance minister. </p><p>A source within the Brazilian government close to Lula told the BBC that the appointment of Rubio as lead negotiator on the tariff issue was still being reviewed by the team led by Vice-President Alckmin.</p><p>The source said that, for the government, it was preferable to have a negotiator who was directly connected to the president and had his endorsement, rather than someone without direct communication with Trump.</p><p>Another source, also involved in the negotiations and speaking to BBC Brasil on condition of anonymity, was more direct: they said that Lula's government would have preferred a different interlocutor to Rubio.</p></div>",

    "body": "<div><p>Balloons carrying thousands of packs of cigarettes have disrupted flights in Lithuania, as Vilnius Airport was forced to close for hours when dozens of them floated into the country's airspace.</p><p>The National Crisis Management Centre (NCMC) told the BBC that 25 meteorological balloons were detected entering Lithuania from neighbouring Belarus, two of which ended up directly over the airport.</p><p>The airport said the shutdown led to 30 flight cancellations affecting 6,000 passengers. It warned that there may still be delays on Monday.</p><p>The \"airspace violations\" come at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c708dzqvz1vo\">a time of heightened tension in Europe</a> after a number of drone incursions, suspected of being linked to Russia, caused air traffic disruption.</p></div><div><p>Moscow has denied any involvement in the recent incidents.</p><p>Up to 14 of the weather balloons launched over the weekend floated over the Vilnius area, home to Lithuania's capital and close to the border with Belarus, Lithuanian officials said.</p><p>At least 11 balloons carrying 18,000 packs of black-market cigarettes have since been recovered, though this number could rise, Lithuania's State Border Guard Service said.</p><p>Despite the disruption they caused, a NCMC spokesman said: \"Balloons with contraband cargo - cigarettes from Belarus - are nothing new in Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland.\"</p><p>So far this year, 544 balloons have been recorded entering Lithuania from Belarus, he said, while 966 were last year.</p><p>Meanwhile, the north-eastern Podlaskie region of Poland, which also borders Belarus, has recorded more than 100 cases in which contraband was flown in from its neighbour using the balloons, which are typically used to carry weather instruments to high altitudes.</p><p>In one instance last month, Polish police detained a Belarusian citizen whose car had been circling cigarettes smuggled in using a balloon. A geolocation tag was reportedly found on his phone linked to the illicit goods.  </p><p>Asked why criminals use a method that is highly susceptible to the weather, rather than much more controllable drones, the NCMC spokesman said: \"Meteorological balloons are a rudimentary tool used by smugglers - they are cheaper than drones for transporting cigarettes from Belarus.\"</p><p>He added: \"Our services' aim is to seize the largest possible quantities of contraband and to detain organisers and perpetrators so that this activity is unprofitable and does not pose a risk to civil aviation.\"</p><p>Drones of unclear origin caused the closure of Danish airports and airspace in September. Drones were also seen over neighbouring Norway and Germany, prompting European leaders to accelerate discussions about strengthening air defences.</p><p>Denmark said at the time there was no evidence to suggest Russian involvement, despite Moscow being blamed for earlier airspace incursions into Poland, Estonia and Romania. </p><p>Russia either denied these earlier incursions or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7401vk4lgzo\">said they were accidental</a> as its full-scale invasion of nearby Ukraine continues.</p></div>",

It was thought he had what it took to fix a discreet deal between the parties and save French politics from implosion.</p><p>But as it turns out, that wasn't the case. </p><p>Lecornu has arguably gone down in even more embarrassing circumstances than his two ill-fated predecessors.</p><p>At least Michel Barnier and François Bayrou both presided for a short while over their governments, and tabled a few ideas.</p><p>Lecornu, on the other hand, named his cabinet late Sunday afternoon and by Monday morning he had lost it. He didn't even get to make his inaugural address to parliament, which was planned for Tuesday. </p><p>His government lasted for precisely 14 hours.</p></div><div><p>The immediate cause of his calamitous fin de régime is now clear. It was the conservative Republicans party (LR) and their leader, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau.</p><p>With its 40 or so MPs, the LR has become a key part of the centre-right alliance that is trying to run France.</p><p>Retailleau has made much of his presence in government about projecting himself and his party as natural candidates for the offices of state. </p><p>Earlier on Sunday, he'd told Lecornu that he was willing to stay on as minister. But within an hour of the cabinet being announced, he posted on social media that there'd been a change of heart: LR might not be joining after all. </p><p>Officially it was because Lecornu had done the dirty by naming former finance minister Bruno Le Maire as his pick for defence. </p><p>Le Maire - a former party colleague - is a particular bugbear of LR, partly because he betrayed them by joining Macron, and partly because they blame him for letting French debt spiral out of control when in control of the country's finances.</p><p>Either way, LR accuses Lecornu of hiding Le Maire's nomination - apparently Retailleau didn't learn of it until he turned on his television.</p><p>And at the end of Monday there was a new twist. Le Maire agreed not to become a minister and Macron gave his outgoing prime minister a last-minute reprieve of 48 hours, to see if he could persuade LR into the government. </p><p>So, the situation remains fluid.</p><p>Whatever happens, the deeper truth is that the more time passes, the harder it is going to be for anyone - even the most gifted of Macron acolytes - to set up a stable government.</p><p>Why? Because the more time passes, the closer France gets to its next big electoral moment – the 2027 French presidential election.  </p><p>So unpopular is Macron today that all who associate themselves with him risk a severe beating the next time the public gets a chance to vote.</p><p>As a result, the fractious centre-right alliance at the heart of Macron-land is now beginning to splinter.  </p><p>The LR are out, but many centrists are starting to mutter too. Even the president's onetime wunderkind former prime minister Gabriel Attal is keeping his distance.</p><p>If it feels like the twilight of an era, then that is what it is. The faithful are leaving, preparing for a world without Macron. It might not be so far away.</p></div>",

    "body": "<div><div><p>18 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Anthony Zurcher</span><span>North America correspondent</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>The US Supreme Court begins its new term on Monday with a docket already full of potentially significant cases that could define the scope of Donald Trump's presidential authority - and the prospect of more to come.</p><p>In the eight months that Trump has been back in the White House, he has tested the limits of executive power, unilaterally implementing new policies, slashing federal budgets and workforce, and attempting to bring previously independent agencies and institutions more directly under his control.</p><p>The latest brewing legal battle comes from the president's attempts to take control of state National Guard units and deploy them in cities where he claims there is public unrest and rampant crime - over the objection of local and state officials.</p><p>In Oregon, a federal judge has issued orders blocking Trump's deployment of troops to Portland. An appeals court is set to review the move in the coming days.</p><p>\"This is a nation of constitutional law, not martial law,\" Judge Karin Immergut, whom Trump appointed to the bench in his first term, wrote in her Saturday opinion. </p><p>\"Defendants have made a range of arguments that, if accepted, risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power - to the detriment of this nation.\"</p></div><div><p>Once the appellate court has its say, the Supreme Court could step in via its so-called \"shadow docket\", issuing a ruling that could curtail Trump's ability to use the military on US soil - or give him a free hand, at least temporarily.</p><p>Such reviews have become a more routine occurrence recently, as a majority of the Supreme Court justices, in response to emergency petitions from the Trump administration, has largely allowed the president's actions to move forward while legal challenges play out.</p><p>\"A tug of war between the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts is going to be a driving force in the coming term,\" Samuel Bray, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, said at a briefing last month.</p><p>The court's reliance on this shadow docket has been criticised by left-leaning legal scholars and politicians as an improper use of the court's authority. Its orders have typically been short, offering limited legal reasoning and leaving lower-level judges with minimal guidance.</p><p>\"All Americans should be alarmed by the Supreme Court's growing reliance on its shadow docket to resolve controversial and high-profile cases without any transparency - no substantive explanations, oral arguments, or reasoning,\" Democratic Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said earlier this year.</p><p>\"This further pushes the Court's deliberations and decisions out of view of public scrutiny and shields it from accountability.\"</p><p>In the coming months, however, the court is set tackle questions of presidential power – and other high-profile controversies - head on, hearing oral arguments and issuing full decisions on their merits.</p><p>\"It's not going to be able to get away with one-page orders that don't explain the reasoning,\" said Maya Sen, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School who specialises in the Supreme Court and US politics. \"If they're going to grant more power to the executive its going to have to explain why.\"</p><p>The court is already scheduled to consider whether federal laws prohibit the president from removing members of agencies designed by Congress to be independent from presidential influence infringe on executive authority.</p><p>The justices will also hear arguments in an expedited review of Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook from her position as a governor on the influential Federal Reserve Board – a case that could dramatically increase the president's power over American economic policy.</p><p>The US – and global economy – is also front and centre as Supreme Court justices will have a chance to decide whether many of Trump's unilaterally imposed tariffs on foreign imports have adequate legal authority or should be voided.</p><p>The justices may also review Trump's attempts to unilaterally cut federal spending and fire lower-level government employees, as well as his aggressive immigration and deportation policies.</p><p>While the court has not yet agreed to consider Trump's attempt to terminate automatic citizenship for those born on US soil, it could do so in the coming months.</p><p>\"The scope of executive power will be front and centre this term,\" said Professor Jennifer Nou of the University of Chicago Law School, in an email to the BBC.</p><p>\"The cases coming before the court will test the Trump administration's highest political and economic priorities, whether tariffs or birthright citizenship.</p><p>\"One question will be whether the justices will apply principles (eg the major questions doctrine) that it used to strike down signature Biden initiatives in a politically even-handed way.\"</p><p>The court used its newly fashioned \"major questions doctrine\" to stymie Biden's efforts at student loan forgiveness and environmental regulations, holding that Congress did not give him explicit authorisation to do so.</p><p>Presidential power is the central focus of this year's Supreme Court term but cases involving several hot-button political and cultural controversies are also scheduled in the coming months.</p><p>The court will review whether a Colorado ban on conversion therapy – a controversial practice that attempts to use counselling to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity – violates constitutional free speech protections.</p><p>Also on the docket are two cases involving state bans on transgender athletes in interscholastic sport competition.</p><p>A Republican congressman in Illinois is challenging a state law that allows mailed ballots to be counted up to two weeks after election day.</p><p>A group of Louisiana conservatives have asked the court to strike down a provision of a voting rights law that requires states to draw congressional districts that guarantee Black voter representation equal to their population level.</p><p>And the Republican Party is targeting a decades-old law that prevents political candidates and parties from coordinating their campaign spending.</p><p>Over the past few years, this conservative-dominated Supreme Court has demonstrated a willingness to issue landmark new rulings that have dramatically shifted America's legal landscape.</p><p>On topics like abortion rights, federal regulatory authority and the consideration of race in college admissions, the court has reversed decades of existing precedent.</p><p>Those decisions have contributed to a public view of the Supreme Court that has become increasingly polarised along partisan lines.</p><p>In a recent Pew Foundation poll, opinions of the nation's highest legal body were split nearly evenly, with Republicans supportive and Democrats highly critical.</p><p>By the time the court issues its final decisions in this term, expected by the end of June next year, the 6-3 conservative majority on the court may have broken new ground, and once again fundamentally reshaped American law.</p><p><i>Additional reporting by Kayla Epstein</i></p></div>",

    "body": "<div><p>New Zealand's government has paid Samoa 10m Samoan Tala (NZD 6m; £2.6m) after one of its naval ships crashed into a reef in Samoan waters before catching fire and sinking last year.</p><p>HMNZS Manawanui started leaking oil into the ocean after it sank, with reports of sea turtles dying and slicks appearing on nearby Samoan beaches.</p><p>New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters said the payment had been made at Samoa's request.</p><p>HMNZS Manawanui was the first ship New Zealand lost at sea since World War Two. It was one of nine ships in the country's small naval fleet, and had been surveying an area of sea floor that had not been mapped in decades when it ran aground.</p></div><div><p>All 75 people aboard were successfully rescued from the vessel as it began listing off the coast of the Samoan island Upolu exactly a year ago.</p><p>Despite being seen billowing smoke as it went down, Samoan officials later said that not all its fuel had burnt off and the ship had leaked oil from various locations - sparking concerns about local marine wildlife. </p><p>Since the ship's grounding, HMNZS Manawanui has remained on the reef but diesel fuel, oil and other pollutants have been removed from the ship while a New Zealand naval team was tasked with removing debris.</p><p>Peters said in a statement that the New Zealand government was continuing to work with Samoa's on decisions relating to the ship and its future.</p><p>\"We recognise the impact the sinking has had on local communities and acknowledge the disruption it caused,\" he said.</p><p>He added that \"minimising any possible environmental impacts and supporting the response\" were \"our absolute priorities\".</p><p>Any disciplinary proceedings were yet to be determined but the New Zealand Defence Force was reaching the end of its investigation, he said.</p><p>An<b> </b>inquiry into the incident found a series of human errors, including a failure to disengage the ship's autopilot, was the root cause of the crash.</p><p>In the days after the crash, social media users started trolling the ship's female captain, claiming her gender was to blame.</p><p>These commenters were denounced at the time by New Zealand's defence minister as \"armchair admirals\".</p></div>",

Those troops also can be deployed abroad, and some units specialise in fighting wildfires or securing the US border.</p><p>Though the National Guard ultimately reports to the Department of Defence, and the president can federalise troops in certain circumstances, requests for its support typically start at a local level. </p><p>The governor of a state makes the call to activate National Guard troops during an emergency, and can request additional help from the president or other states.</p><p>National Guard troops have limited power, however. They do not enforce the law, or make arrests, seizures, or searches. And a law called the Posse Comitatus Act limits the power of the federal government to use military force for domestic matters.</p></div><p></p><h2>How is Trump trying to use the National Guard in cities?</h2><p></p><div><p>Trump has tried to circumvent the normal process for deploying the National Guard several times now.</p><p>In June, he took control of the California National Guard to respond to protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles, even though California Governor Gavin Newsom objected. California filed two lawsuits against the Trump administration.</p><p>One lawsuit challenged Trump's seizure of the National Guard, but an appeals court ultimately ruled in favour of the president. In a second lawsuit, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5ylyd9lkkqo\">a federal judge found </a>that Trump's use of the National Guard troops in Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act.</p><p>This summer, hundreds of National Guard troops arrived in Washington, DC because of what he called a \"situation of complete and total lawlessness.\" Trump cited homelessness and crime rates as justification.</p><p>Trump has now <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2dnk0ee6pyo\">authorised the deployment of 300 National Guard to Chicago </a>following immigration protests, particularly outside detention facilities. Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, alleged Trump is trying to \"manufacture a crisis\" and has filed a lawsuit.</p><p>This week, Trump attempted to deploy the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, before a federal judge temporarily blocked the action late Sunday night.</p></div><p></p><h2>What legal basis does Trump use to deploy the National Guard?</h2><p></p><div><p>A little-known provision of US military law governs the president's authority to deploy the National Guard on his own. But up until now, presidents rarely used it.</p><p>10 US Code § 12406 allows the president to call National Guard troops from any state into service if the US is \"invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation,\" or \"there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion\" against the US government.</p><p>Trump invoked this law to federalise 2,000 National Guard troops in June in order to support ICE missions.</p><p>Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth also cited the law in a memo deploying 200 members of the Oregon National Guard into federal service on 28 September.</p><p>\"We're very confident in the president's legal authority to do this,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on 6 October. \"And we're very confident we will win on the merits of the law.\"</p></div><p></p><h2>Why does Trump want to use the National Guard in Portland?</h2><p></p><div><p>Trump is again seeking to use the National Guard to respond to demonstrations, after protests near an ICE building in Portland over the weekend. </p><p>Federal officers, including with the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Patrol agency, clashed with demonstrators who opposed Trump's mass deportation initiative.</p><p>The Portland Police Bureau said it arrested two people on 4 October who engaged \"in aggressive behaviour toward each other in the street\" and refused to follow orders. One person was in possession of bear spray and a collapsable baton.</p><p>Oregon Public Broadcasting reported that federal law enforcement fired tear gas and smoke canisters to break up the protest and made several arrests.</p><p>Trump has claimed the city is \"burning down,\" but Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, a Democrat, said \"there is no insurrection in Portland, no threat to national security.\"</p><p>The Trump administration has moved to send 200 California National Guard troops to neighboring Oregon to respond to the protests.</p><p>But US District Judge Karin Immergut, who Trump appointed during his first term, has temporarily blocked his action in a pair of back-to-back rulings.</p><p>On Saturday, Judge Immergut blocked Trump from federalising the Oregon National Guard. \"This is a nation of constitutional law, not martial law,\" she wrote in her ruling.</p><p>The next day, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c740elm70z7o\">she issued a temporary restraining order</a> against him deploying California's National Guard in Portland instead. </p><p>The Trump administration is expected to appeal.</p></div></article>",

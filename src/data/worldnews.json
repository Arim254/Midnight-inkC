    "body": "1 day agoGeorge WrightGetty ImagesTens of thousands have taken to the streets of Portugal's capital, Lisbon, to protest against proposed labour laws which they say threaten workers' rights.The centre-right government wants to make it easier for employers to fire people,  outsource work to other companies, and limit some types of compassionate leave, including cutting bereavement leave for women who suffer miscarriages.It says the measures are needed to improve job flexibility and increase productivity in one of western Europe's poorest countries.The head of Portugal's largest union, CGTP, called the reforms \"one of the greatest attacks ever made against workers\" in the country and announced a general strike for 11 December.The bill is likely to pass in parliament with support from far-right party Chega.The union told Reuters that around 100,000 protesters filled Lisbon's main avenue, while the Associated Press also reported tens of thousands of people were present. No police estimate was available.Speaking at the protest, Miriam Alves, 31, a worker at a medical device company, told Reuters that reforms are \"clearly a step backward in working conditions and could lead to a complete lack of job security\".Archive technician Madalena Pena, 34, said the government was reversing labour rights \"in an unfair, subtle, and cunning way, without having said anything before the election\" in May.CGTP general secretary Tiago Oliveira announced the strike for next month at the protest.On the proposed changes, he said: \"If implemented, it would be a real setback in the lives of each and every one of us.\"Protesters also wanted higher wages. Official data shows more than 50% of workers earned less than 1,000 euros (£879) per month last year. The minimum wage is only 870 euros (£764).",

    "body": "5 hours agoEPA/ ShutterstockFlight delays and cancellations continue to snarl US air travel for a third day as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned air traffic will be \"reduced to a trickle\" if the US government shutdown continues.More than 2,900 flights to, from, or within the US were cancelled and 8,600 delayed by late afternoon on Sunday, according to flight tracker FlightAware. The longest delays were reported in Newark, New Jersey – more than two hours on average.In a hopeful sign, lawmakers are working on a possible deal to reach a compromise on government funding and end the shutdown, according to US media reports. The Senate was scheduled to convene on Sunday in a rare weekend session.Duffy warned the impacts on air travel will grow dire if they do not break the stalemate soon.\"You're going to see air travel be reduced to a trickle,\" he said on CNN on Sunday. He added that travellers trying to fly home for the Thanksgiving holiday later this month may not be able to get there.\"Many of them are not going to be able to get on an airplane, because there are not going to be that many flights that fly if this thing doesn't open back up,\" he said.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced last week that it would be reducing air travel capacity by up to 6% this weekend and 10% by next weekend at 40 of the nation's busiest airports. The cuts do not apply to international flights, but some airlines may choose to also cancel some of those flights, the FAA said.Air traffic controllers, who are not being paid during the shutdown, are reportedly fatigued and not coming to work, triggering the reductions in air traffic allowances. Duffy said Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth offered to have military air traffic controllers step in to help but he declined the offer because they are not certified to direct air traffic at the civilian airports.Altogether, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are not being paid since the Government ran out of money on 1 October. Food assistance for low-income Americans also has been in limbo, with the administration agreeing to pay only half of monthly benefits.   Sunday marked the 40th day of the longest shutdown in history as Republicans and Democrats still have not agreed on a funding resolution to reopen the government.The two parties have blamed each other for causing the impasse and for the travel disruptions. The White House said on Friday that Democrats were \"inflicting their man-made catastrophe on Americans just trying to make life-saving medical trips or get home for Thanksgiving\".Meanwhile, on Saturday Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer accused Republicans of \"playing games with people's livelihoods\".Democrats have refused to back any Republican spending plan unless money for health insurance subsidies be included, while Republicans want to provide funding for the government without anything else attached.   US President Donald Trump suggested over the weekend money should be sent directly to Americans to buy health insurance rather than to insurance companies. Republican senators are working on a compromise package that could end the impasse with a vote to advance legislation possibly coming on Sunday.",

    "body": "Three people died and 15 more were injured after powerful waves battered popular Spanish holiday island Tenerife. A woman died after being pulled into the ocean near the Puerto de la Cruz resort and a man died at Santa Cruz de Tenerife, emergency services said on Sunday. A third man was found dead in the ocean near a beach in Granadilla.Emergency services have told the public to stay away from coastal paths and to avoid taking pictures and videos of the rough seas, as the turbulent weather continues. Rescue services said they airlifted a man who fell into water at La Guancha in the north of the island, but that he was later pronounced dead at hospital. They said another man died after he was found floating near a beach at El Cabezo in the south, with lifeguards and medical staff unable to resuscitate him. At Puerto de la Cruz, a holiday resort in northern Tenerife, one woman died of a heart attack and another 10 people were swept out to sea. Three of those were seriously injured and taken to hospital.A local waiter, who gave his name only as Pedro, told the Reuters news agency that he jumped into the water in an attempt to save people being swept out. \"As soon as I saw a man waving at me I took my clothes off, jumped to the water and I managed to grab three of them and save them. I couldn't save the woman because she passed away at that moment,\" he said. Eyewitness Carlos said he warned people taking photos to move away from the waves but \"they did not pay attention\".Officials say the Canary Islands, the Spanish archipelago Tenerife belongs to, are on alert for coastal hazards. They warned sea conditions are expected to worsen with swells reaching two-to-four metres, and tourists and locals should exercise \"extreme caution\".",

    "body": "Syrian President Ahmed Sharaa has arrived in Washington for an official visit, just two days after the US formally revoked his status as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. The former Islamist militant will meet US President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, 11 months after his rebel alliance ousted Bashar al-Assad.Hours before his arrival in the US capital it was announced that Syrian security services had detained dozens of suspected members of the so-called Islamic State group.Joint efforts to tackle what remains of the group in Syria are expected to be high on the agenda during Sharaa's talks with Trump.Syrian authorities said 71 suspected members of the group were arrested, with weapons and explosives also seized.Since taking power, Sharaa has looked to reestablish Syria's presence on the world stage after decades of isolation under the Assad regime and 13 years of civil war.He travelled to the US in September to address the UN General Assembly, where he said Syria was \"reclaiming its rightful place among the nations of the world\" and called on the international community to remove sanctions.Earlier this week the UN Security Council backed a US resolution to lift measures, which coincided with Washington continuing a months-long process of gradually easing sanctions on Syria and its new leaders.On Friday, Sharaa and his interior minister, Anas Hasan Khattab, were removed from a US register of individuals suspected of supporting or funding extremist groups, a decision the Treasury Department said was \"in recognition of the progress demonstrated by the Syrian leadership\".Sharaa had been listed under the name Muhammad al-Jawlani, the alias he used as leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The group was affiliated with al-Qaeda until 2016, when Sharaa severed ties.Prior to leading HTS, Sharaa fought for al-Qaeda in Iraq and was for a time imprisoned by US forces. He was also subject to an American bounty of $10 million.The US lifted its sanctions on HTS earlier this year.Trump previously met Sharaa in May during a visit to Riyadh, where he described him as a \"tough guy, very strong past\".Despite his background, Sharaa has drawn backing from governments that opposed the Assad regime by vowing to lead a moderate government which can win support from Syria's various ethnic groups and factions.Earlier this year, he vowed to root out elements of his security forces which were accused of executing members of Syria's Alawite minority. Deadly violence has also broken out in recent months between Sunni Bedouin tribal fighters and Druze militias, raising questions over whether the HTS-led government can restore stability to a country defined by war for more than a decade.

    "body": "1 day agoCBSMaria Florinda Rios Perez was fatally shot after arriving at the wrong home for a house-cleaning appointment US officials are looking into whether to file charges against an Indiana homeowner who shot and killed a house cleaner who mistakenly showed up at the wrong address.Police say they found Maria Florinda Rios Perez dead in her husband's arms on the front porch of a home on Wednesday shortly before 0700 local time (12:00 GMT). Authorities had been responding to a call about a possible home invasion in the Indianapolis suburb of Whitestown. The two did not appear to have entered the home, police said in a statement. They have formally submitted the case to the Boone County Prosecutor's Office for review to determine whether criminal charges will be brought in the case. Police have not identified the people in the home or who fired the shot, saying in a statement on Friday that it is a \"complex, delicate, and evolving case, and it would be both inappropriate and potentially dangerous to disclose that information\". They urged patience, warning of a \"concerning spread of misinformation online\" about the case.Mauricio Velazquez, told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that he wanted justice for his 32-year-old wife. News reports say that she was a mother of four and originally from Guatemala. In an interview with CBS affiliate WTTV, Mr Velazquez said the bullet came right through the door of the home. \"They should've called the police first instead of just shooting out of nowhere like that,\" he said through an interpreter.CBSMauricio Velazquez said the bullet that killed his wife came through the door of the home they went to early on WednesdayBoone County prosecutor Kent Eastwood told The Indianapolis Star that the case is complex due to the language of the state's stand-your-ground law.Stand-your-ground laws are in place in many US states and most permit an individual to protect themselves with the use of reasonable force, including deadly force, to prevent death or great bodily harm.Similar incidents have made headlines across the US in recent years. In 2023, Ralph Yarl, who was then 16, was shot twice after ringing the doorbell of the wrong home in Missouri. Andrew Lester, who was in his 80s, pleaded guilty and died while awaiting sentencing. In New York, 20-year-old Kaylin Gillis died after being shot upon entering the wrong driveway. The homeowner who shot her is now serving a 25-year sentence. ",

    "body": "7 minutes agoAndré Rhoden-Paul and Kelly Ng,SingaporeAt least seven people have died after a boat carrying undocumented migrants sank near the border between Thailand and Malaysia.Thirteen people have been rescued but hundreds are missing - they were among a group of 300 people, most of whom are Rohingyas, who left Myanmar's impoverished Rakhine state two weeks ago on a larger vessel before splitting onto small boats, said a Malaysian maritime official.The capsized vessel is believed to have gone down near the resort island of Langkawi, the Malaysian Coast Guard said.Rescue efforts have entered a second day, with the search area expanded from 170 to 256 square nautical miles. Malaysia's maritime authority expects the search to last seven days.The body found in the water on Sunday was that of a Rohingya woman, Malaysia's state-owned news agency Bernama reported.Of the 13 rescued, 11 are Rohingyas and two are Bangladeshis. The sunken boat was carrying about 70 people, while the status of the boats carrying the remaining migrants are \"unclear\", Malaysian authorities said on Monday.The Rohingyas, who are primarily Muslim, are one of the many ethnic minorities in the predominantly Buddhist country, but they are denied citizenship by the government of Myanmar.Since August 2017, a deadly crackdown by Myanmar's army sent hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas fleeing across the border into Bangladesh.Conflict and poor living conditions in Bangladesh however have also prompted some Rohingyas to make precarious journeys on overcrowded vessels to Malaysia, a Muslim country which some envision to be a safe haven in the region.Officials say many of them would have each paid more than $3,000 (£2,300) for these passages by sea.These boats are often small and cramped, lacking in basic facilities like water and sanitation. And they do not always make it to Malaysia. Some die while being stranded at sea, while others are sometimes detained or deported. ",

He left behind parents, a sister, two brothers, and a fiancée.Hamas's armed wing had said on Sunday that it would hand over Lt Goldin's body as part of a ceasefire deal.Hamas has now returned all 20 living hostages, and 24 out of 28 deceased hostages under the first phase of the deal.On Sunday, Lt Goldin's father Simcha Goldin said in a statement: \"Victory means bringing home the hostages and bringing home our soldiers to Israel.\"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog both said they had kept a picture of Lt Goldin in their offices for the past 11 years. Netanyahu said \"we didn't give up\" on bringing him home.\"I know the agony that his family's been through, I know the longing for his return that united the people of Israel and today we're united in bringing him finally to his parents, to his family, to a grave in Israel.\"Efforts to retrieve Lt Goldin \"involved extensive intelligence efforts, alongside operational activities on the ground\" over the past decade and during the last two years of war between Israel and Hamas, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.The military expressed \"deep condolences to the family and continues to make every effort to return all the deceased hostages and is prepared for the continued implementation of the agreement\".Herzog said the government would \"continue to act tirelessly\" to bring home all the hostages.Of the four hostages who remain in Gaza, three are Israeli and one is Thai.ReutersLt Goldin, from Kfar Saba, is the only deceased hostage whose remains were being held in Gaza before the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, which sparked the latest war. He was killed in combat on 1 August 2014, not long after the start of a ceasefire in that year's war between Israel and Hamas. He was among a group of Israeli soldiers patrolling an agricultural area near Rafah in southern Gaza when they were attacked by a group of Hamas fighters. The Israeli military determined that Lt Goldin was killed along with two other soldiers in a firefight, and that his body was then dragged into an underground tunnel by the Hamas fighters.The Israeli military unleashed massive firepower to try to prevent Hamas from taking Lt Goldin hostage. Scores of Palestinian civilians were killed in the bombardment of Rafah, which continued for four days, including after Lt Goldin was declared dead.Nine years later, the Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage. At least 69,176 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures the UN considers reliable.During the ongoing first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Before Lt Goldin's body was returned, Israel had also handed over the bodies of 300 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of 20 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas, along with those of three foreign hostages - one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.The parties also agreed to an increase of aid to the Gaza Strip, a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a halt to fighting, although violence has flared up as both sides accused one another of breaching the deal.On Saturday in Gaza, two Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire. The Israeli military said two people had crossed the yellow line marking the line of Israeli control and posed an \"immediate threat\".Separately, one Palestinian was shot dead in Gaza by Israeli fire and another was wounded on Saturday, local medics and the Israeli military said.Gazan medical officials said the person who died was killed by Israeli fire east of Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. Civil defence rescuers said the injured Palestinian was wounded by Israeli gunfire in Khan Younis.Israeli military actions have killed at least 241 people since the start of the ceasefire, according to the Gaza health ministry.",

    "body": "In the three weeks since the Louvre museum heist, as investigators sought to find out who was behind it and why the French crown jewels had been so easy to steal, another mystery remained: who the \"fedora man\" was.The dapper youth in a hat was photographed outside the museum that Sunday and went viral on social media, prompting theories about his identity.Police moved swiftly to arrest and charge four people for the crime, while the Louvre director admitted CCTV security was inadequate.However, the fedora man remained an enigma - until now.The dandy, it turns out, is a local teenage fan of Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot who just happened to be at a real crime scene.Pedro Elias Garzon Delvaux, a 15-year-old from Rambouillet, south-west of Paris told the Associated Press (AP) news agency that he had planned to visit the Louvre with his family but found the museum was closed. \"We didn't know there was a heist,\" he said.As he asked officers about the closure, an AP photographer seeking to capture the security cordon took a picture and included Pedro in the frame.Pedro only realised the photo had gone viral four days later, when a friend sent him a screenshot asking: \"Is that you?\"When he replied that it was, the friend said he had five million views on TikTok. \"I was a bit surprised,\" Pedro told the AP.He was even more shocked when his mother called to say the picture had appeared in The New York Times. It made a big impact on him, he said, because he reads that newspaper and \"it's not every day you're in the New York Times\". \"People said, 'You've become a star'. I was astonished that just with one photo you can become viral in a few days.\"Asked why he wore an old-fashioned waistcoat and a fedora to the museum, Pedro said he began dressing this way recently, inspired by 20th-century statesmen and fictional detectives.\"I like to be chic,\" he told the AP. \"I go to school like this.\"As wild speculation about the photo of him circulated online - some wondered whether he might be a real detective or an AI fake - Pedro remained silent for weeks.\"I didn't want to say immediately it was me,\" he said. \"With this photo there is a mystery, so you have to make it last.\"",

    "body": "2 days agoSteve Mellen and Alys DaviesA former British soldier is facing extradition to Kenya in connection with the alleged murder of a 21-year-old woman there in 2012.The National Crime Agency (NCA) said Robert James Purkiss was arrested in Tidworth, Wiltshire on 6 November and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday.He was arrested by specialist officers from the NCA's National Extradition Unit in connection with the killing of Agnes Wanjiru after a warrant was issued in September, the agency added.Mr Purkiss, 38, told the court he intended to contest the extradition and was remanded into custody ahead of his next appearance at the same court on 14 November.His lawyers told the court that he \"vehemently denies\" murder.Ms Wanjiru's body was discovered in a septic tank near a hotel in the town of Nanyuki, about 124 miles (200km) north of Nairobi, three months after she had gone missing on 31 March 2012. She had a five-month-old baby at the time.Her body was found near a British army training camp. On the night she was killed, she had reportedly been at a bar with friends where British soldiers were also present. Ms Wanjiru's niece, Esther Njoki, met the UK's defence minister last month in order to push for Mr Purkiss's extradition. In a statement issued through Leigh Day, the lawyers acting for Ms Wanjiru's family, on Friday Ms Njoki said: \"My family is incredibly relieved to hear that the suspect in my aunt's case has been arrested.\"We have waited so many years for this moment which marks an important step towards finally obtaining justice for our beloved Agnes.\"Leigh Day partner Tessa Gregory said: \"This is a huge moment for our client and her family who have been fighting for over a decade to obtain justice for Agnes.\"We hope the UK and Kenyan authorities will now work together to ensure that the suspect can face trial in Kenya as quickly as possible.\"Ms Wanjiru's family has long accused the British army of covering up her death and the Kenyan authorities of failing to properly investigate the case at the time.An inquest into her death was opened in 2018 following pressure from Ms Wanjiru's family, as well as Kenyan rights groups and feminists.In 2019, it concluded that Ms Wanjiru had been unlawfully killed by one or two British soldiers and that she had suffered stab wounds to the chest and abdomen.Later in 2021, a Sunday Times investigation reported that a British soldier had confessed to colleagues that he killed Ms Wanjiru. The soldier left the army after the incident and reportedly continued to live in the UK.In 2024, the army announced it was launching an internal review into the conduct of British soldiers in Kenya, including in Nanyuki.It found 35 suspected cases of soldiers having engaged in sexual exploitation and abuse, including transactional sex, with local women - nine of these being after the army officially banned such conduct in 2022.",

    "body": "1 day agoOttilie Mitchell and Harry SekulichUS aviation authorities have ordered that all models of a cargo plane that crashed mid-takeoff in Kentucky on Tuesday be grounded.It comes after a Boeing MD-11 aircraft operated by UPS burst into flames on the runway of Louisville International Airport before colliding into neighbouring businesses, killing 14 people. The American delivery firm had earlier said it would not operate the planes pending an ongoing investigation, with FedEx then following suit.Now the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a formal notice banning all MD-11 and MD11F aircraft from flying until safety checks are carried out.In total, 70 models are in use with UPS, FedEx and Western Global Airlines.FAA officials said the Kentucky crash happened after the plane's left engine caught fire and detached from the wing during take-off. The aircraft was carrying 38,000 gallons (144,000 litres) of fuel as it took off for a flight to Hawaii, which contributed to the size of the fire after the crash.A total of 14 people were killed in the crash and subsequent fire, including one person who had been admitted to hospital, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg has said.He said the number of dead now matches the number of people who were reported missing, indicating officials do not expect the death toll to climb further.Boeing said it welcomed the directive and that it had already advised the three firms which use the model to stop operating it out of \"an abundance of caution\".It is unclear whether the order will impact delivery services in the US, with none of the three companies reporting disruption so far.Data collated by the live air traffic website FlightRadar24 showed 55 MD-11 planes were used over the past week. \"Contingency plans are in place to flex our integrated air and ground network to help protect time-sensitive, critical shipments such as lifesaving pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and other products move through our network without disruption,\" FedEx said in a statement.UPS also said contingency plans were in place to continue its service. A statement continued: \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.\"The final passenger flights using an MD-11 was in 2014, with the model used exclusively as a cargo carrier since.The model of aircraft involved in the crash was an MD-11F triple-engine plane, which first entered service 34 years ago with Thai Airways as a passenger jet, but was transferred to UPS in 2006.MD-11s were originally manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, before the company merged with Boeing in 1997. Production of MD-11 planes ended in 2000.",

    "body": "1 day agoJames Landale,Diplomatic correspondent in Kyiv and Alex KleidermanAt least six people have died after Russia launched hundreds of missile and drone attacks on energy infrastructure and residential targets in Ukraine overnight.A strike on an apartment building in the city of Dnipro killed two people and wounded 12, while three died in Zaporizhzhia. In all, 25 locations across Ukraine, including the capital city Kyiv, were hit, leaving many areas without electricity and heating. Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on Telegram that major energy facilities were damaged in the Poltava, Kharkiv and Kyiv regions, and work was under way to restore power. In Russia, the defence ministry said its forces had shot down 79 Ukrainian drones overnight.The Ukrainian air force said Russia had launched more than 450 exploding bomber drones and 45 missiles. Nine missiles and 406 drones were reportedly shot down.The Ukrainian Energy Ministry said there were power cuts in the Dnipropetrovsk, Chernihiv, Zaporizhzhya, Odesa and Kirovohrad regions, but restoration work was ongoing.Svyrydenko said critical infrastructure facilities have already been reconnected, and water supply is being maintained using generators. Russia argues its attacks on energy targets are aimed at the Ukrainian military.Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure ahead of winter are now a familiar part of this war. But ministers in Kyiv are acutely concerned that Moscow is not just trying to damage the morale of Ukraine's people but also bring its economy to a standstill by collapsing its energy network. Analysts say this fourth winter of Russia's full scale invasion will prove a significant test of Ukraine's defensive resilience.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the attacks showed there must be \"no exceptions\" to Western sanctions on Russian energy as a way of putting pressure on Moscow. The missile strikes came only hours after the US gave Hungary a one-year exemption from restrictions on buying oil and gas from Russia. In October, the US effectively blacklisted two of Russia's largest oil companies, threatening sanctions on those who buy from them. But on Friday, during a visit to Washington by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban - a close personal and political ally of Donald Trump - the US president  announced the exemption for Budapest.In a message on Telegram, Zelensky said the overnight attacks showed that \"pressure must be intensified\" on Russia.He said \"for every Moscow strike on energy infrastructure - aimed at harming ordinary people before winter - there must be a sanctions response targeting all Russian energy, with no exceptions\".He said Ukraine expected \"relevant decisions from the US, Europe and the G7\".Debates about sanctions can sometimes seem technical or diplomatic. But for people in Ukraine, they are very real. If Russia can sell its oil to Hungary, it can use the money earned to build more drones and missiles, like those it launched against Ukraine on Friday night.",

    "body": "20 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinGetty ImagesTravellers wait in a long line at a security checkpoint at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport on 6 NovemberMore than 1,400 flights to, from, or within the US were cancelled on Saturday after airlines were told this week to cut traffic during the federal government shutdown.Nearly 6,000 flights were also delayed, down from over 7,000 delays on Friday, according to flight tracker FlightAware. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced earlier in the week that it would be reducing air travel capacity by up to10% at 40 of the nation's busiest airports as air traffic controllers, who are working without pay during the shutdown,  report fatigue.Republicans and Democrats remain divided over how to end the impasse in Congress. Saturday marked the 39th day of the longest shutdown in history. Senators are in Washington over the weekend for bipartisan negotitations aimed at resolving the deadlock. Republicans have rejected an offer by Democrats to pass the current funding bill, in exchange for a one-year extension to health care subsidies.The shutdown is beginning to be felt by more and more Americans amid cuts to food aid payments and the flight disruptions. In a statement on Saturday, American Airlines urged party leaders \"to reach an immediate resolution to end the shutdown\".New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport was experiencing some of the longest wait times. As of Saturday afternoon, arrivals to the airport were delayed by an average of more than four hours, while departures from the airport were delayed by an average of 90 minutes, according to the FAA. The airports with the most cancelled flights on Saturday, both to and from the location, were Charlotte/Douglas International, Newark Liberty International, and Chicago O'Hare International, according to FlightAware. Flights to John F Kennedy and LaGuardia airports in New York were delayed by nearly three hours and an hour respectively, the FAA reported on Saturday afternoon. Other airports affected by lengthy delays inncluded Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International. With the Thanksgiving holiday approaching on 27 November, it's one of the busiest travel seasons of the year in the US. It's not just commercial flights that have been affected. Restrictions on private jets are also in place, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a Saturday post on X.  \"We've reduced their volume at high traffic airports - instead having private jets utilise smaller airports or airfields so busy controllers can focus on commercial aviation,\" Duffy wrote. \"That's only fair.\"And things are likely to get worse in the coming days as the FAA cancels more flights. On Thursday, the agency announced that the flight reductions would be gradual, starting at 4% of  flights on Friday before rising to 6% by 11 November, 8% by 13 November, and the full 10% by 14 November.The FAA said the cuts were necessary to maintain safety as air traffic controllers have been overworked during the shutdown. As essential workers, the controllers are required to continue working without pay, and as a result, many have called in sick or taken on second jobs to afford necessities, unions say. Watch: \"Devastating\" - Airline travellers react to flight reductionsThe controllers are just some of the 1.4 million federal workers who have either been working without pay or been put on forced during the shutdown.Another factor impacting air travel is that most of the Transportation Security Agency (TSA) 64,000 agents are also not being paid while the shutdown is in place.During the last government shutdown, under the first Trump administration in 2018, it was found that up to 10% of TSA staff chose to stay at home rather than work while they weren't receiving a paycheque.",

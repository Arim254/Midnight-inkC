    "body": "Just nowImogen Foulkes,Geneva correspondentandOlivia IrelandReutersPeople in the area have been leaving tributes to the victims of the deadly New Year's Day fireThe Swiss bar that was the scene of a fire that killed 40 people and injured 116 hadn't undergone safety checks for five years, authorities have said.The mayor of Crans-Montana, Nicolas Feraud, told a Tuesday press conference that he could not explain why Le Constellation bar hadn't been checked in so long, but that the council was \"profoundly sorry\".  \"We regret that - we owe it to the families and we will accept the responsibility,\" he said.He added that sparklers - which are believed to have caused the fire when they were raised too close to the ceiling - will be banned in local venues. Local authorities will now bring in an external contractor to inspect and audit all 128 venues in the area. At the news conference, Feraud conceded there was a team of five people inspecting more than 10,000 buildings in Crans-Montana and could not explain why the bar had not been inspected since 2019.Taking repeated questions on why the bar had not been checked in so long, Feraud said: \"I have no answer for you today.\"\"We're profoundly sorry about that and I know how hard that will be for the families.\" \"I'm not resigning, no, and I don't want to,\" he later added. Feraud said it would be \"down to the judges\" to decide whether members of the local authority would be included in a criminal investigation that has been opened by Swiss prosecutors.AFP via Getty ImagesCrans-Montana Mayor Nicolas Feraud announced that all kinds of sparklers would be banned from being used in local venuesWhen the fire occurred on New Year's Day, the bar seemed to have many more people in it than legally permitted, which Feraud said was the responsibility of the managers of Le Constellation to regulate.Swiss prosecutors have placed the two bar managers under criminal investigation, which local media have named as French couple, Jacques and Jessica Moretti. They are both suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office in Valais said.Feraud said the use of sound-proofing material on the ceiling of the bar and allowing sparklers in the venue was extremely negligent. But he also suggested the local authorities hadn't viewed the materials used as risky.Questioned on why authorities had not acted on pictures of sparklers close to the bar's ceiling that were widely available on social media and used as promotion for Le Constellation before the fire, Feraud said it was likely no-one in the council saw the images. Safety regulations are determined by cantons in Switzerland's devolved political system. But they must then must be implemented by the local authorities.Many local councillors are elected to work on a part-time basis. The Swiss are generally proud of this system as they believe it makes the authorities much more accountable to voters.But the new year's fire raises questions about the system, with warnings signs  appearing not to have been followed up.

    "body": "Tomorrowland, the hugely popular European electronic dance music or EDM festival, will stage its first-ever full-fledged Asia edition in Thailand this December.Thailand was chosen for its \"growing influence on the global stage of music, innovation, and experience-driven tourism\", Tomorrowland said on Tuesday.Founded 20 years ago by Belgian brothers Manu and Michiel Beers, Tomorrowland has become one of the world's most iconic celebrations of EDM. Its annual Belgian edition often features ambitious, creative stages and wild parties that draw music lovers from across the world.Organisers are expecting more than 50,000 attendees each day in the Thai beach town Pattaya from 11 to 13 December. Pre-registration for tickets begins on 8 January. A \"full madness pass\" covering all three days of the festival will cost 12,500 baht ($400; £300) while a single-day pass is going at 5,100 baht.More details on the festival's theme and line-up will follow soon, organisers said. Although the Tomorrowland group has held events in some Asian cities, this is the first time it will be holding an entire festival in the continent, and one that is similar to the scale of what it does in Belgium.  Thailand finalised an agreement with Tomorrowland to host the event for five years and expects it to generate 21bn baht ($673m; £497m) over the period, Thai media reported.\"Expanding Tomorrowland to a new continent is a milestone we approach with great respect and excitement... This is the beginning of a long-term story,\" said Tomorrowland's chief executive officer Bruno Vanwelsenaers.In recent years, Thailand has become a strong contender in the live music scene. Last year, it played host to international music festivals like Electric Daisy Carnival and Creamfields. Bangkok was also a stop on K-pop band Blackpink's world tour last October. And the country's homegrown music and arts festival Wonderfruit is emerging as a hot destination on the festival circuit, drawing tens of thousands of people each year.",

    "body": "2 hours agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology correspondentNvidia has unveiled a new tech platform for self-driving cars as the world's leading chip-maker seeks more physical products to embed AI into.Speaking at the annual CES technology conference in Las Vegas, boss Jensen Huan said the system - called Alpamayo - would bring \"reasoning\" to autonomous vehicles.That would allow cars to \"think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments, and explain their driving decisions,\" Huang claimed.He said Nvidia was working with Mercedes to produce a driverless car powered by the tech, which would be released in the US in the coming months before being rolled out in Europe and Asia.Nvidia's chips have helped power the AI revolution, though so far attention has mostly been focussed on the software it powers, such as ChatGPT.However, leading tech firms are now increasingly looking for hardware - meaning physical products such as cars - that AI could be used in.Wearing his trademark black leather jacket, Huang told an audience of hundreds that the project has taught Nvidia \"an enormous amount\" about how to help partners build robotic systems. \"The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is almost here,\" Huang said.\"NVIDIA's pivot toward AI at scale and AI systems as differentiators will help keep it way ahead of rivals,\" said Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight, from Las Vegas.\"Alpamayo represents a profound shift for NVIDIA, moving from being primarily a compute to a platform provider for physical AI ecosystems.\"Shares of the AI chip designer rose slightly in after-hours trading following Huang's presentation.It featured a video demonstration of the AI-powered Mercedes-Benz driving through San Francisco while a passenger, sat behind the steering wheel, kept their hands in their lap.\"It drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators,\" Huang said, \"but in every single scenario... it tells you what it's going to do, and it reasons about what it's about to do.\"Alpamayo is an open-source AI model, with the underlying code now available on machine learning platform Hugging Face, where autonomous vehicle researchers can access it for free and retrain the model, Huang said. \"Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous,\" he told the audience.The project could pose a threat to companies like Elon Musk's Tesla, which offers driver assistance software called Autopilot.\"Well that's just exactly what Tesla is doing,\" Musk posted on social media following the Alpamayo announcement. \"What they will find is that it's easy to get to 99% and then super hard to solve the long tail of the distribution.\"Like Tesla, Nvidia also has plans to launch a robotaxi service by next year in collaboration with a partner, but has declined to name the partner or say where it will be.Nvidia is the world's most valuable publicly traded company, with a market cap of more than $4.5tn (£3.3tn). It became the first company to reach $5tn in October, but has lost value over concerns about whether demand AI is overhyped.The company also revealed that its Rubin AI chips are currently being manufactured and are due for release later this year.The highly-anticipated hardware can compute using less energy than Nvidia's current line of AI chips, and could drive down the cost of developing the technology.",

    "body": "Canada's former deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland has said she will leave parliament to accept a job as adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Freeland said her role as an economic development adviser for Ukraine would be unpaid. In July, she will also take on a position to lead the Rhodes Trust, an educational charity, in the UK. She was elected in 2013, and served in key roles such finance, foreign affairs and international trade minister under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.She broke from Trudeau in late 2024, accusing him in a public resignation letter of failing to take the threat of US tariffs seriously, which helped force his political exit.Freeland posted on X on Monday: \"Ukraine is at the forefront of today's global fight for democracy, and I welcome this chance to contribute on an unpaid basis as an economic adviser to [Zelensky].\"In the coming weeks I will also leave my seat in Parliament. I want to thank my constituents for their years of confidence in me. I am so grateful to have been your representative.\"As well as stepping down as an MP for Toronto's riding of University-Rosedale, a Liberal safe seat, she said she would quit her other role as Canada's special representative for the reconstruction of Ukraine.Earlier on Monday, Zelensky announced on X that Freeland would be taking on the role as adviser.The Ukrainian president said she had \"extensive experience in attracting investment and implementing economic transformations\". Zelensky's announcement had spurred calls from opposition politicians for her to step down.Conservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong said \"one cannot be a Canadian MP and an adviser to a foreign government\".  \"She must do one or the other,\" he added.In November it was announced that this summer Freeland would become CEO of the Rhodes Trust, which administers Rhodes scholarships to Oxford University.In September, she stepped down as Carney's minister of transport and internal trade to take on the new role as Canada's special envoy to Ukraine, and announced she would not be running in the next federal election. A former journalist who is of Ukrainian heritage, Freeland has long been a vocal supporter of Kyiv in its war with Russia. In 2014, she was placed on a Kremlin list of Westerners banned from entering Russia in retaliation for sanctions against Moscow.In 2020, Freeland became the first woman to be appointed as finance minister in Canada's history, where she managed Canada's financial response to the Covid pandemic.She is also credited with helping renegotiate the current free trade agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico during President Donald Trump's first term in 2018. Trump later called her \"toxic\".The USMCA trade deal - or CUSMA in Canada - has been credited with helping the country largely avoid a stiff 35% tariff rate imposed by Trump, who granted Canada an exemption for goods covered by the free trade agreement.That deal is now up for another round of renegotiations this year.

    "body": "1 hour agoPaulin KolaEPARussia has intensified attacks - particularly against Ukraine's energy sectorFrench President Emmanuel Macron is hosting Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky and other key allies of the country as efforts intensify to agree security guarantees for Kyiv in the event of a ceasefire with Russia.Heads of state and top officials from more than 30 countries - part of the so-called Coalition of the Willing - are taking part, including US mediators in peace talks Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law. Zelensky met Trump recently and said his plan to end the war with Russia was 90% agreed.However, the proposals have yet to be presented to Russia, whose response so far has been far from encouraging.The outstanding 10% of the agreement that's yet to be decided concerns territorial concessions Kyiv is being asked to agree to.Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions form the industrial region of Donbas.Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has been making slow progress on the ground recently and, therefore, is unwilling to compromise on its aim to seize full control of Donbas.Russia has also consistently opposed any idea of a temporary ceasefire and has intensified its attacks in Ukraine, particularly aimed at paralysing its power supplies in the middle of a harsh winter.Ukraine has also hit back with drones - the latest target being an oil depot in the Lipetsk region of western Russia. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte are among the participants at the Paris meeting. Leaders are expected to seek agreement on details that include a multi-national force to reassure Ukraine after a peace deal, what security guarantees to offer Ukraine in the event of a renewed Russian attack - as well as helping Ukraine's armed forces and its economy.For months, the so-called \"backstop\" has been on the agenda - the desire among Ukraine's European allies to secure a pledge from the US that it will be involved in responding to Russia should it violate the terms of a peace deal.Following talks between Zelensky and Trump in Florida last month, the Ukrainian leader said Washington had offered security guarantees for 15 years - but a time frame for their implementation is not yet clear.The talks in Paris are being overshadowed by the aftermath of the US's military action in Venezuela, where elite troops went in to seize the country's President Nicolás Maduro and take him to face drugs and weapons charges in New York.Following the raid, Trump said the US would \"run\" Venezuela for an unspecified period of time.He also said the US was returning to last century's policy of US supremacy in its sphere of influence in the Western hemisphere. Looming larger over the Paris talks is Trump's subsequent insistence that the US wants to annex Greenland - the semi-autonomous territory that is part of Denmark, a Nato ally.The repeated threat prompted Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to say any such move from the US would be the end of the trans-Atlantic alliance. European leaders have been reluctant to criticise Trump's intervention in Venezuela and its perceived implications for the world order.But many, including Starmer and Macron, have sided with Denmark over Greenland.As host of the talks, Macron will be keen not to have the issue derail the focus on Ukraine.",

    "body": "3 hours agoGeeta PandeyBBC Correspondent, DelhiThe survivor of a gang rape in the northern Indian state of Haryana has been discharged from hospital a week after her horrific assault, a police official told the BBC.The 26-year-old mother-of-two was taken to hospital in Faridabad city on the morning of 30 December with serious head and facial injuries and several fractures.Her sister said she was out visiting a friend and was waiting for transport just after midnight when two men in an ambulance offered her a lift. They drove her to a deserted place where they raped her and then threw her out of the speeding vehicle.A police spokesman said they had acted swiftly and arrested the two men and seized the vehicle.The woman was discharged by the hospital on Monday night following treatment and surgeries.Senior police official Mukesh Kumar told the BBC that they have approached the court to allow her to visit the prison for an \"identification parade\". Once the court order comes, she would be asked to pick out the two suspects from a crowd of men.The police said the crime took place on the intervening night of 29th and 30th December.\"The incident took place between 12.30 and 02:00. One stood outside the van and kept an eye on the surroundings while the other raped the woman inside the van,\" Yashpal Yadav, public relations officer of Faridabad police, said.Police had questioned the suspects, who were later produced in court and sent to prison, he added.A doctor at the hospital where the survivor was treated had said that the woman was brought in \"at around 05:30 on 30 December... she had a lot of injuries\".Shalini Chopra, a social worker and an opposition politician, who spoke to the survivor after she was discharged from the hospital told the BBC that the woman was \"better but still in pain\".The case has provoked anger and outrage in India and drawn comparisons with the horrific gang-rape of a 23-year-old woman on a bus in Delhi in December 2012.Delhi Nirbhaya rape death penalty: What do hangings mean for India's women?Hyderabad case: Why Indians are celebrating the killingsWas Delhi gang rape India's #Metoo moment?That crime had made global headlines, led to huge protests in Delhi and several other cities and forced the government to introduce tough new anti-rape laws that included the death penalty for the most gruesome attacks.Four men convicted of the gang-rape and murder were hanged in 2020. One of the rapists died in prison while a juvenile was freed after spending time in a reform centre. But despite the heightened scrutiny of sexual crimes since then, tens of thousands of rapes and sexual assaults continue to be reported every year.According to latest police records, 29,670 rapes and 2,796 attempted rapes were reported in 2023. In addition, police also recorded 849 cases of child rapes and 94 cases of attempted rapes of children.",

Then came the US special forces operation targeting Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela, followed by a second warning on Sunday.Such direct and potential threats from a sitting US president, issued while protests are still ongoing, are highly unusual and could embolden demonstrators and encourage the unrest to spread further. Iranian police and security forces have already responded violently almost from the outset, and reports by human rights groups claim that more than 20 people have already been killed. Now eyes are on Trump's possible move.The protests, which began peacefully on Sunday 28 December, were initially driven by public anger over soaring inflation and the sharp devaluation of the local currency against the US dollar which now stands at about 80% higher than a year ago.Iran's economy is in deep trouble, with little prospect for growth this year or next. Official annual inflation stands at around 42%, food inflation exceeds 70%, and some basic goods have reportedly risen in price by more than 110%. Vulnerable positionInternational sanctions led by the United States have played a major role in worsening economic conditions, but they are not the full story. High-profile corruption cases in Iranian courts involving senior officials and their families have reinforced public anger and the belief that parts of the ruling elite are exploiting the crisis. Many ordinary Iranians believe that certain officials and their relatives benefit directly from sanctions through special arrangements that allow them to control imports and exports, move oil revenues abroad, and profit from money laundering networks. Even the government officials believe those who are locally called \"Sanctions Profiteers\" are to blame more than the sanctions themselves.EPAThe protests began over the economy but have also become politicalMerchants in Tehran's Grand Bazaar were among the first groups to openly protest, closing their shops in response to daily currency fluctuations and taking to the streets to demand government intervention to stabilise the markets. Demonstrations soon spread beyond the bazaar to other segments of society. Economic slogans quickly turned political, with calls for the removal of the entire Islamic Republic itself. Students joined the protests, followed by small businesses in other cities and towns and other ordinary Iranians. Within days, chants against Iran's supreme leader once again became a central feature of the demonstrations.The last time Iran experienced unrest on a comparable national scale was around four years ago, when the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman in the custody of the morality police sparked the most widespread anti-government protests since the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979. Those demonstrations, which later became known as the \"Mahsa Movement\" or \"Woman, Life, Freedom\", shook the foundations of the state but were eventually suppressed through force and mass arrests.Although the current protests have spread rapidly and persisted for days, they have not yet reached the scale or intensity of the 2022 demonstrations. Journalists in Iran are under immense pressure, and independent international news organisations are either not allowed to report from inside the country or, if granted permission, face severe restrictions on their movements. As a result, much of what is known comes from social media and people on the streets sharing what they witness and record. This makes verification increasingly difficult, especially as social media can also provide fertile ground for fabrications, unfounded claims, and distorted realities, a challenge further intensified by the rise of AI.Against this backdrop, many observers believe the present situation could have more serious consequences than 2022. Iran's government is widely seen as being at its weakest point in decades, facing simultaneous pressure from domestic unrest and a dramatically altered regional environment.Series of setbacksThe 12-day war in the summer of 2025 between Iran and Israel marked a turning point. The conflict culminated in direct US involvement, including air strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. ReutersIran's missile and other military sites were badly damaged in the war with Israel The war severely damaged Iran's defence capacity, nuclear infrastructure, and several military and industrial sites. At the same time, Iran's broader regional position has deteriorated. The fall of Bashar al-Assad in Syria deprived Tehran of a key ally, while sustained Israeli attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon eliminated much of the group's senior leadership. More recently, US operations in Venezuela and snatching of Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, have further narrowed Iran's options abroad.These developments have reshaped the regional and international environment for Tehran. Iran now has fewer allies to rely on in regional conflicts and fewer channels to move oil revenues overseas. This is particularly significant given Iran's heavy involvement in Venezuela's oil sector alongside Russia, and its reliance on complex financial arrangements linked to markets believed to be in China.The disruption of these networks has increased Iran's economic vulnerability at a time of mounting internal pressure.Against this backdrop, Iran's aging supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, appears to be facing one of the most uncertain moments of his rule. More than three decades of careful planning to build regional proxy forces, sanction-evasion mechanisms, and nuclear infrastructure have been undermined or destroyed in a relatively short period of time. With Trump back in the White House and Benjamin Netanyahu in power in Israel, there appears to be no clear diplomatic or strategic path out of the current crisis without a hefty price.For years, Khamenei and his inner circle justified massive spending on regional allies and the nuclear program as necessary investments in Iran's long-term security and technological advancement. Today, that argument appears increasingly hollow. As pressure builds both inside and outside the country, security at home, once presented as the ultimate payoff of those policies, seems more distant than ever.",

    "body": "4 hours agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterGetty ImagesNestle has issued a global recall of some baby formula products over concerns they contain a toxin which can cause food poisoning.The food and drink giant said specific batches of its SMA infant formula and follow-on formula were not safe to be fed to babies.The batches were sold across the world, Nestle said, and they potentially contain cereulide, which can trigger nausea and vomiting when consumed.The company said there had been no confirmed reports of illness associated with the products, but was recalling them \"out of an abundance of caution\".\"The safety and wellbeing of babies is our absolute priority,\" Nestle said. \"We sincerely apologise for any concern or inconvenience caused to parents, caregivers, and customers.\"The company confirmed to the BBC that the recall was global. Affected products were sold in several European countries, including France, Germany, Austria, Denmark, Italy and Sweden.It stressed that all other Nestle products and batches of the same products that have not been recalled are safe to consume.Nestle promised refunds for customers and said the problem was caused by an ingredient provided by one of its suppliers.Nestle France said it was carrying out a \"preventive and voluntary recall\" of certain batches of its Guigoz and Nidal infant formulas.In Germany, the formula products are called Beba and Alfamino.Batch numbers of the affected products in the UK can be found on Nestle's UK website, or through food.gov.uk.Customers are advised to look for the corresponding code on the base of the tin or box for powdered formulas or the base of the outer box and on the side or top of the container for ready-to-feed formulas.NestleNestle has recalled some batches of its SMA infant and follow-on formulaCereulide is a toxin produced by some strains of the Bacillus cereus bacteria that can cause food poisoning symptoms, which can be quick to develop and include vomiting and stomach cramps.It is unlikely to be deactivated or destroyed by cooking, using boiling water or when making the infant milk, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) warned.The FSA's head of incidents, Jane Rawling, said parents, guardians and caregivers should not feed infants or young children the affected products.She added: \"I want to reassure parents, guardians and caregivers that we are taking urgent action, helping to ensure all of the affected product is removed from sale as a precaution.\"If you have fed this product to a baby and have any concerns about potential health impact, you should seek advice from healthcare professionals by contacting your GP or calling NHS 111.\"Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "Netflix has pulled a Chinese drama series from its Vietnam platform after Hanoi objected to an episode featuring a map with contested territorial claims in the South China Sea.The 27-episode romance drama Shine on Me includes images of the so-called nine-dash line which Vietnam has condemned as \"inaccurate\" and \"infringing upon national sovereignty\".China uses the line in its maps to demarcate its territorial claims in the South China Sea. Vietnam is one of many countries that object to these claims.Vietnam's culture ministry issued a demand for the series to be removed on 3 January and gave Netflix 24 hours to comply.A BBC check on Tuesday found it could no longer be viewed on Netflix's Vietnam platform.The disputed map appears several times in episode 25 of Shine On Me, in a scene about China's solar power potential.The show's main characters attend a lecture where a map of China which shows part of the nine-dash line is projected on an auditorium screen.Shine On Me is popular within China and other territories, ranking among Netflix's Top 10 shows in Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam before it was pulled.Beijing has not officially commented on the ban, although its state-run newspaper Global Times published an article on Tuesday urging Hanoi to \"separate cultural exchanges from [the] South China Sea issue\".In recent years China has increasingly asserted its claims of sovereignty over several land parcels and their adjacent waters in the South China Sea, despite complaints from Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei.Beijing has expanded some islands and built structures on them, and conducted  sea patrols which at times have resulted in heated confrontations with the Philippine navy.China argues that various pieces of evidence, from pottery shards to navigational guides used by Chinese fishermen, back up its claims of historical sovereignty.In 2016 an international tribunal in The Hague ruled against Chinese claims in the South China Sea, but Beijing did not recognise the judgement.The dispute between Beijing and Hanoi particularly centres on the Paracel and Spratly island chains, which the nine-dash line loops around on Chinese maps.China says its right to the area goes back centuries to when these island chains were regarded as integral parts of the Chinese nation.Vietnam hotly disputes this, saying China had never claimed sovereignty over the islands in the South China Sea before the 1940s. Hanoi says it has actively ruled over the Paracels and the Spratlys archipelagoes since the 17th Century and that it has the documents to prove it.There are many issues that could provoke public uproar in Vietnam – including what citizens consider insulting depictions of the Vietnam war – but the nine-dash line is one that consistently draws authorities' attention.On most other issues, the Vietnamese government actively works to contain anti-China sentiment, but criticism affirming Hanoi's claims in the South China Sea is one of very few forms of protest it deems acceptable.Between 2019 and 2024, Vietnam filed eight written takedown requests with Netflix, according to the streaming platform's reports.In 2023, Vietnam had also ordered Netflix to remove another Chinese drama, Flight to You, over a similar map. Chinese dramas are not the only productions to be banned by Vietnam for featuring the nine-dash line.Authorities banned Warner Bros' Hollywood blockbuster Barbie in 2023, and DreamWorks' animated film Abominable in 2016, for similar reasons.Additional reporting by Sen Nguyen in Bangkok",

    "body": "9 minutes agoPaulin Kola'We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security,' Trump saysOne of Donald Trump's most influential aides has said Greenland should become part of the US in order to protect Nato and the Arctic.Asked in an interview with CNN to confirm the US would rule out the use of force to annex the semi-autonomous region of fellow Nato member Denmark, Stephen Miller said, \"nobody's going to fight the US over the future of Greenland.\"On Sunday Trump repeated his insistence that the US \"needs\" Greenland - to the consternation of Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen who said an attack by the US would spell the end of Nato.Six European allies rallied to Denmark's support with a joint statement on Tuesday.\"Greenland belongs to its people, and only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations,\" read the statement by the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and Denmark.In his interview with CNN, Miller said it was \"the formal position of the US government that Greenland should be part of the US\".He went on: \"By what right does Denmark assert control over Greenland? What is their basis of claiming Greenland as a colony of Denmark?\"The top Trump aide also said the US \"is the power of Nato. For the US to secure the Arctic region, to protect and defend Nato and Nato interests, obviously Greenland should be part of the US.\"Nato is a trans-Atlantic military group where allies are expected to go to each other's aid in case of external attacks.The issue of Greenland's future resurfaced in the wake of the US military intervention in Venezuela, during which elite troops went in to seize the country's President Nicolás Maduro and take him to face drugs and weapons charges in New York.Following the raid, Trump said the US would \"run\" Venezuela for an unspecified period of time.He also said the US was returning to an 1823 policy of US supremacy in its sphere of influence in the Western hemisphere - and he warned a number of countries the US could turn its attention to. In the wake of the Venezuela intervention, Miller's wife Katie posted on social media a map of Greenland in the colours of the American flag, alongside the word \"SOON\".It has reignited fears that the US may consider using force to secure control of Greenland, a vast island in the Arctic - something the US president has previously refused to rule out. Trump has claimed that making it part of the United States would serve American security interests due to its strategic location and its abundance of minerals critical to high-tech sectors. The Trump administration's recent move to appoint a special envoy to Greenland prompted anger in Denmark.Greenland, which has a population of 57,000 people, has had extensive self-government since 1979, though defence and foreign policy remain in Danish hands. While most Greenlanders favour eventual independence from Denmark, opinion polls show overwhelming opposition to becoming part of the US.More on this storyFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

However, the region has remained largely unrecognised on the global stage and Somalia considers Somaliland to be an integral part of its territory.Israel's recognition of Somaliland last month came as a surprise, with Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu citing Somaliland's \"right to self-determination\".This move sparked international condemnation and prompted an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. China, Turkey and the African Union were among those criticising Israel's step. The US defended Israel, accusing its critics of double standards.In a statement following Israel's announcement, Saar said: \"Somaliland was not created this past weekend. It has existed as a functioning state for more than 34 years. \"The attacks on Israel's recognition of Somaliland are hypocritical. Only Israel will decide who to recognise and with who to maintain diplomatic relations.\"",

    "body": "Central African Republic (CAR) President Faustin-Archange Touadéra has won a third term after securing an outright majority in last month's presidential election, provisional results show. The 68-year-old mathematics professor was widely expected to win after the main opposition coalition boycotted the poll, citing concerns about electoral fairness. Touadéra campaigned on his security record in the chronically unstable nation after rebels seized power in 2013, a crisis that led the government to enlist support from Russian mercenaries and Rwandan soldiers.He has faced heavy criticism after a 2023 constitution removed term limits, allowing him to keep running for office.More than 2.4 million people registered for the 28 December general election, which observers described as largely peaceful despite delays caused by the late arrival of voting material and problems with the electoral register.Touadéra secured 76% of the vote, according to preliminary results announced late on Monday by the election agency.His closest challengers, Anicet-Georges Dologuélé and Henri-Marie Dondra, both former prime ministers, received 15% and 3% of the vote respectively.Both have called for the results to be annulled, alleging widespread irregularities and fraud.On Friday, Dologuélé said there had been \"a methodical attempt to manipulate\" the outcome.The main opposition coalition, known by its French acronym BRDC, boycotted the election, saying it was unlikely to be fair.The government has denied the claims. The Constitutional Court has until 20 January to rule on any challenges and declare the final results.The CAR is one of Africa's poorest and most unstable countries, even though it is rich in resources such as diamonds and uranium. The UN estimates that about half the population is dependent on humanitarian aid.Since 2013, the landlocked country has been mired in conflict after rebels seized power, ousting then-President François Bozizé. A 2019 peace deal between the government and 14 armed groups helped ease tensions, though six of the groups later withdrew from the agreement.Analysts say Touadéra's win could bolster the interests of Russia, which has provided security assistance in exchange for access to resources such as gold and diamonds.The CAR was one of the first African countries where Wagner, a Russian mercenary group, became active, providing security to Touadéra.",

    "body": "12 minutes agoKayla EpsteinGetty ImagesPresident Donald Trump says the US oil industry could be \"up and running\" with increased operations in Venezuela within 18 months, after a surprise military operation removed President Nicolás Maduro from power.Trump told NBC News that \"a tremendous amount of money will have to be spent, and the oil companies will spend it, and the oil companies will spend it, and then they'll get reimbursed by us or through revenue\".Representatives from major US petroleum companies planned to meet the Trump administration later this week, BBC's partner CBS News reported.Analysts previously told the BBC it could take tens of billions of dollars, and potentially a decade, to restore Venezuela's former output.Trump's remarks came days after he said the US would \"run\" Venezuela after the ousting of Maduro - who has now been brought to the US to face criminal charges.Speaking to NBC about his 18-month timeframe, Trump speculated that oil production could ramp up \"in less time than that, but it'll be a lot of money\".He has been explicit for about his ambitions for American petroleum companies to scale up their operations in the country.\"Having a Venezuela that's an oil producer is good for the United States because it keeps the price of oil down,\" Trump added.The analysts who previously spoke to the BBC were sceptical that Trump's plans would have a major impact on the global supply - and therefore price - of oil. They suggested that firms would look for reassurance that a stable government was in place, and even when they did invest, their projects would not deliver for years. Trump has claimed in recent days that American oil companies can fix Venezuela's oil infrastructure. The country has an estimated 303m barrels, the world's largest produces reserve. But it produces just a fraction of that amount, and its production has been in decline since the early 2000s.The Trump administration sees significant potential for its own energy prospects in Venezuela's reserves.Increasing the country's production of oil would be expensive for US firms. Additionally, Venezuelan oil is heavy and more difficult to refine. There is only one US firm, Chevron, currently working in the country.Asked for comment about Trump's plans for US oil production in Venezuela, Chevron spokesman Bill Turenne said the company \"remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets\".\"We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations,\" Turenne added.Other major US energy companies Exxon and ConocoPhillips did not immediately respond to requests for comment.While justifying the seizure of Maduro from Caracas, Trump also claimed that Venezuela \"unilaterally seized and stole American oil\".Vice President JD Vance echoed those claims on X after Maduro was taken, writing that \"Venezuela expropriated American oil property and until recently used that stolen property to get rich and fund their narcoterrorist activities\".The reality is more complex. Energy law experts told BBC Verify that oil found in Venezuela was owned by the government.\"Petroleum companies have a right to extract it and commercialise it under a license/concession agreement,\" explained Ignacio Herrera Anchustegui from the University of Bergen in Norway.Venezuela nationalised its oil industry in 1976.  In 2007, under the presidency of Hugo Chavez, Venezuela exerted more state control over the remaining foreign-owned assets of US oil firms operating in the country.

It was able to show that tennis can be really huge,\" she said.\"That exhibition, it was fun. It was a great challenge.\"Sabalenka, who received a first-round bye in Brisbane, will face Romania's Sorana Cirstea in round three.The Australian Open starts on 18 January.GB's Boulter and Kartal win in AucklandBritish number four Katie Boulter started her season with victory over Ukraine's Yuliia Starodubtseva at the ASB Classic in Auckland.Playing her first match since October - and her first under new coach Michael Joyce - Boulter triumphed 6-3 6-3 in the first round.Given a main draw wildcard for the WTA 250 tournament, she will face top seed Elina Svitolina of Ukraine next.Boulter missed out on a place in the main draw of the Australian Open after falling out of the world's top 100.She is currently the third alternate and, without sufficient withdrawals, will need to win through qualifying at Melbourne Park.Compatriot Sonay Kartal beat Indonesia's Janice Tjen 6-1 6-7 (4-7) 6-3 in the first round in Auckland.World number Kartal 68, who reached the last 16 of Wimbledon in 2025, will play Germany's Ella Seidel in round two.",

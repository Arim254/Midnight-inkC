    "body": "German nurse gets life in jail after murdering 10 to reduce workload22 hours agoTabby WilsonGetty ImagesA palliative care nurse in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison after he was convicted of the murder of 10 patients and the attempted murder of 27 others.Prosecutors alleged that the man, who has not been publicly named, injected his mostly elderly patients with painkillers or sedatives in an effort to ease his workload during shifts overnight.The offences were committed between December 2023 and May 2024 in a hospital in Wuerselen, in western Germany. Investigators are reported to be looking into several other suspicious cases during his career.According to media outlet Agence France-Presse (AFP), the unnamed man had been employed at the hospital in Wuerselen since 2020, after completing training as a nursing professional in 2007. Prosecutors told a court in Aachen that he showed \"irritation\" and a lack of empathy to patients who required a higher level of care, and accused him of playing \"master of life and death\". The court was told that he injected patients with large doses of morphine and midazolam, a type of sedative, in an effort to reduce his workload during night shifts.He was arrested in 2024.When issuing the life sentence, the court said that the man's crimes carried a \"particular severity of guilt\" which should bar him from early release after 15 years.He will be able to appeal the verdict.Prosecutors have told AFP that exhumations are taking place to identify further potential victims, which could see the man put on trial again.The case bears similarity to that of former nurse Niels Högel, who was handed a life sentence in 2019 after he was convicted of murdering 85 patients at two hospitals in northern Germany. A court found that he administered lethal doses of heart medication to people in his care between 1999 and 2005.He is believed to be the most prolific killer in Germany's modern history.",

    "body": "14 hours agoKathryn Armstrong and David GrittenIsrael has confirmed Hamas handed over the remains of deceased Tanzanian hostage Joshua Mollel on Wednesday under the US-brokered Gaza ceasefire deal.The Israeli prime minister's office said that, following the completion of forensic tests at the National Centre of Forensic Medicine, the foreign ministry had informed the 21-year-old student's family.Mollel was undertaking an agricultural internship in southern Israel when Hamas-led gunmen attacked on 7 October 2023. He was killed at Kibbutz Nahal Oz and his body was then taken by fighters.His return means six deceased hostages - five Israelis and one Thai - are still in Gaza.\"The government of Israel shares in the deep sorrow of the Mollel family and all the families of the fallen hostages,\" the Israeli prime minister's office said in a statement on Thursday.It also stressed that Hamas was required to return all the deceased hostages under the ceasefire deal, adding that Israeli authorities would \"spare no effort until we return all of the fallen hostages, every last one of them.\"The Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel said: \"Amid their grief and the knowledge that their hearts will never fully heal, Joshua's return offers some comfort to a family that has endured unbearable uncertainty for over two years.\"Before handing over Mollel's remains to the Red Cross in Gaza on Wednesday evening, Hamas's military wing said that it had recovered a hostage's body in the eastern Shejaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City.In recent days, Israel has allowed members of Hamas and Red Cross staff to search for remains in the area, which is inside territory still controlled by Israeli forces.The body of Israel-US soldier Staff Sgt Itay Chen was found there on Tuesday.Under the first phase of the ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages it was holding within 72 hours.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has handed over the bodies of 285 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 19 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas, along with those of three foreign hostages - one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.Five of the six dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis and one is Thai.Israel has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the bodies, while Hamas has insisted it is struggling to find them under rubble.The slow progress has meant there has been no advance on the second phase of President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan. This includes plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas, and reconstruction.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the 7 October 2023 attack, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "1 day agoWill GrantCentral America and Cuba correspondentMexico President Claudia Sheinbaum has said she will press charges against a man who groped her during a public appearance.Mobile phone footage of the incident on Tuesday shows Sheinbaum speaking to a group of supporters on a street near the National Palace in Mexico City. In the video, a man approaches her from behind and attempts to kiss her on the neck and place his hands on her body. Sheinbaum moved away quickly and a member of her team stepped in, but she was visibly shaken. The offender has been arrested.\"My view is, if I don't file a complaint, what will happen to other Mexican women? If they do this to the president, what will happen to all women in our country?\" Sheinbaum said at a news conference on Wednesday.\"I decided to press charges because this is something that I experienced as a woman, but that we as women experience in our country,\" she said. \"I have experienced it before, when I wasn't president, when I was a student.\"She added that she had decided to press ahead with bringing charges against the suspect as he had allegedly harassed other women in the crowd.\"A line must be drawn,\" she said.Women's rights groups and feminist commentators have said the incident shows the extent of ingrained machismo in Mexican society, where a man believes he has the right to accost even the president if she is a woman. Femicide is also a huge problem in Mexico, with a staggering 98% of gender-based murders estimated to go unpunished.Sheinbaum promised to tackle the issue as a candidate, but so far in her administration there has been no discernible improvement in that area of violent crime.The incident also comes amid discussions about presidential security and the wider safety of politicians.As president, Sheinbaum has broadly followed the approach of her predecessor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, in having close and regular contact with her supporters on the streets or in campaign events. On occasion, that has presented security concerns for her team. However, she confirmed in her new conference she had no intention of changing her policy of interacting with her supporters.The incident also happened just days after the murder of Carlos Manzo, the mayor of Uruapan, a municipality in the violent state of Michoacan, at the local Day of the Dead celebrations.Manzo had called on Sheinbaum for greater federal support in Uruapan in the fight against drug cartels. Around 35 candidates were killed in the lead up to the general election last year in what was considered the bloodiest campaign in modern Mexico.Since taking office, Sheinbaum has made in-roads in improving the country's dire security situation, particularly clamping down on fentanyl-trafficking – a key issue for her US counterpart, President Trump.",

    "body": "5 hours agoLily Jamali,in San Francisco and Aoife Walsh,in WashingtonNancy Pelosi has announced her retirement from Congress, ending a decades-long career that saw the California Democrat become one of the most powerful figures in US politics.In a video message on Thursday, Pelosi said she will not be seeking re-election to Congress at the end of her term in January 2027.It marks the end of a storied political career: Pelosi, 85, became the first woman to serve as Speaker of the House and led her party in the lower chamber of Congress from 2003 until 2023.\"We have made history, we have made progress,\" Pelosi said in her message. \"We have always led the way, and now we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our democracy, and fighting for the American ideals we hold dear.\"\"As we go forward, my message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power,\" Pelosi added.Pelosi was first elected to Congress to represent San Francisco in 1987 aged 47, and quickly rose through the ranks. She was elected by her party to be speaker of the House in 2007, becoming the first woman to serve in that role. She served until 2011, when Democrats lost control of the lower chamber, before returning to the speaker's chair from 2019 to 2023.Speaker of the House is the one congressional job detailed in the US Constitution. After the vice-president, it is next in line to the presidency.In that role, Pelosi played a critical role in advancing - or thwarting - the agendas of multiple presidents during her long career on Capitol Hill.She is widely credited with marshalling the passage of former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare legislation, as well as bills to address infrastructure and climate change during Joe Biden's presidency.Pelosi also directly challenged Donald Trump throughout his presidency, famously ripping up a copy of his State of the Union address behind his back.By then she was also a lightning rod for Republican anger - in their eyes, representing the coastal elites pushing a big-spending, radical platform.She led two impeachment efforts against Trump - the first in 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine. Trump was accused of pressing Ukraine to dig up damaging information on Biden, and of using military aid as leverage. He was later acquitted in the Republican-controlled Senate.The second was in 2021, when he was accused by the House of inciting the storming of the Capitol - the seat of the US Congress - with a speech on 6 January to supporters outside the White House. That effort ultimately failed and Trump was acquitted once again.On Thursday, when asked about Pelosi's retirement, Trump said she was \"an evil woman\".\"I'm glad she's retiring. I think she did the country a great service by retiring,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office. \"I think she was a tremendous liability for the country.\"After Trump's first term, Pelosi worked with Biden to shepherd much of his legislative agenda through her chamber despite the razor-thin margins.In less than two years, Democrats in the House pushed through a Covid relief bill, a bipartisan infrastructure spending package, a multi-trillion-dollar environment and social spending programme, and legislation protecting gay marriage.She was succeeded as Democratic leader in the House by New York Representative Hakeem Jeffries in 2022.Since leaving her speakership, she has remained a major political influence. Most recently, she played a key role in helping to pass Proposition 50 in California -  a state redistricting effort aimed at flipping five House seats to Democrats during the midterms in 2026.",

    "body": "13 hours agoBethany Bell,Vienna and Yogita Limaye,South Asia and Afghanistan correspondentOpium farming in Afghanistan has dropped significantly following a ban imposed by the Taliban government in 2022, the United Nations said.The total area of land for growing opium poppy shrank 20% since last year, while the amount of opium has fallen by 32% over the same period, the UN's Office on Drugs and Crime said in a survey.Afghanistan used to produce more than 80% of the world's opium, with heroin made from Afghan opium making up 95% of the market in Europe.But after retaking power the Taliban banned the practice in April 2022, saying opium was harmful and went against their religious beliefs. The UN said most farmers continued to observe the ban despite \"severe economic challenges\".Many Afghan farmers are harvesting cereals, but poppy - from which opium, the key ingredient for the drug heroin can be extracted - continues to be \"far more profitable\" than legitimate crops, the UNODC noted.Over 40% of available farmland has remained fallow because of the lack of profitable alternatives, limited agricultural outputs and, adverse climate conditions it added.The total area under opium poppy cultivation this year was estimated at 10,200 hectares, mostly in the north-east of the country, with Badakhshan province accounting for the largest share. Before the 2022 ban, more than 200,000 hectares were under poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. Four provinces with opium poppy cultivation in 2024 (Balkh, Farah, Laghman, Uruzgan) were declared opium poppy-free in 2025. \"The near elimination of cultivation from traditional strongholds illustrates the scale and durability of the ban on opium poppy cultivation,\" the survey said.The Taliban's efforts to destroy opium fields occasionally sparked violent resistance from the farmers, particularly in the north-east, the UNODC said, noting that casualties were reported during clashes in several districts of Badakhshan.But the vast majority of Afghan farmers adhere to the ban issued by the Taliban's supreme leader. However, farmers say they lack support to grow alternative crops - as a result, they have to choose between poverty or punishment.\"If we violate the ban, we face prison. If we comply, we face destitution,\" one unnamed farmer in Helmand province told BBC Pashto this summer.\"If there's no money, then I'll grow poppies again.\"Poppy fields are no longer openly visible in Helmand, but they do still exist.Another farmer showed BBC Pashto around his small walled-off poppy field in front of his house in a remote village. He's risking jail, but he said he had no option.\"What should I do? I'm forced to do this - I have nothing else. I can't even provide food for my family.\"While opium is in decline, trafficking in synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine have risen since the ban, the UNODC said. Seizures of such drugs in and around Afghanistan was 50% higher in late 2024 compared with the previous year. Organised crime groups favour synthetic drugs which are easier to produce and less vulnerable to climate shocks, the UNODC said.",

    "body": "Attackers have boarded a ship off the coast of Somalia after firing machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades at the vessel, according to a UK maritime agency.Greek shipping company Latsco Marine Management confirmed the attack on a ship carrying gasoline, saying all the ship's 24 crew were \"safe and accounted for\" and \"we remain in close contact with them\".The crew have taken shelter in the ship's fortified safe room, Reuters news agency quotes an official from maritime security company Diaplous as saying. European Union naval forces operating in the area have been asked for assistance, Reuters says.The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) says the raid happened about 560 nautical miles south-east of the Somali town of Eyl. \"The Master of a vessel has reported being approached by one small craft on its stern. The small craft fired small arms and RPGs towards the vessel,\" UKMTO said in a statement.Private security firm Ambrey said the attackers were probably Somali pirates, who have been active in the region in recent days.According to Latsco, the attack on the Malta-registered vessel occurred at around 11:48 local time (08:48GMT). \"[Latsco] has activated its emergency response team and is coordinating with the relevant authorities to ensure the continued safety and welfare of the crew,\" it said.The vessel, named Hellas Aphrodite, was built in 2016, and was en route from Sikka, India, to Durban, South Africa, it saidThe attack comes amid a resurgence of piracy in the region, which had declined after peaking more than a decade ago.There were at least seven reported incidents last year, and several fishing vessels have already been seized by pirates this year, according to the International Maritime Bureau.",

    "body": "A Ukrainian court has handed down the first jail sentence for life against a Russian soldier accused of killing a Ukrainian prisoner of war.Dmitry Kurashov, 27, was found guilty of shooting dead Vitalii Hodniuk, a veteran 41-year-old Ukrainian soldier who had surrendered following capture in 2024.Ukraine's national police said that \"expert reports, witness testimony and video footage from the scene confirmed that the Russian soldier deliberately killed the POW on the orders of his commanders, who had instructed troops not to take Ukrainian soldiers captive\".In a months-long trial which began earlier this year, the court heard how Kurashov's unit stormed a Ukrainian position in the region of Zaporizhzhia on the morning of 6 January 2024.The prosecution said that although Hodniuk crawled out of a dugout unarmed and surrendered, Kurashov shot him point-blank with several aimed AK-47 shots – a violation of the laws of war.Kurashov and the rest of his unit were later overpowered by Ukrainian forces and taken as prisoners of war.Kurashov initially pleaded guilty but later retracted, saying he had only done so to expedite the trial in the hope that he would be released in a prisoner swap. He maintained it was a Russian medic – who later died – who fired the shots that killed Hodniuk.His version was refuted by other members of his own unit who were later captured by Ukrainian troops and were also being held as prisoners of war.They said they saw Hodniuk emerge from the foxhole unarmed with his hands up after Kurashov called for Ukrainians to come out of their foxholes and surrender.Although they did not witness the shooting because there were explosions at the same moment, all three said nobody but Kurashov had been around when they heard the gunshots. One said the medic accused by Kurashov was not present on the scene when the killing occurred.Kurashov himself never testified. According to court reporters, his lawyer Anna Karpenko said her client \"sincerely repented\" and that he believed he had simply been following orders from above not to take any prisoners.Nikita Manevsky, the prosecutor who pushed for the harshest sentence, had argued Kurashov had showed \"no remorse\" and \"nothing but indifference\" during the trial.Earlier this year, Kurashov told the BBC he had joined the Storm V assault unit in exchange for early release from a remote penal colony in Russia where he was serving a sentence for theft. Representatives from the Russian military told the convicts that if they joined the army and went to Ukraine their sentences would be expunged, Kurashov said.The recruitment of prisoners to fight in the war in Ukraine – which Russia calls a \"special military operation\" – is a known practice.Convicts who sign up are sent to join the generally poorly trained Storm V penal military units. Its troops are often employed to join \"meat grinder\" assaults on the front line – a tactic which sees waves of soldiers push forward relentlessly to try to wear down Ukrainian forces and expose their locations to Russian artillery.In May the Ukrainian intelligence directorate (HUR) said it had recorded more than 150 cases of battlefield executions of POWs by Russian soldiers since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Last year the head of the War Department at the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office told the BBC that executions of prisoners of war by Russian forces had \"clear signs of being part of a policy\" as they were happening across vast areas.Ukrainian forces have also been accused of executing Russian prisoners of war, but the number of such claims has been much smaller.",

    "body": "2 hours agoIan AikmanReutersThe UN Security Council has voted in favour of a US resolution to lift sanctions on Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa ahead of his White House visit next week.Sharaa was named transitional president after leading a rebel offensive that ousted Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, ending 13 years of civil war. Washington's ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz said the UN had sent a \"strong political signal\" that recognised Syria was in a \"new era\" since Assad was deposed.Sharaa was under UN sanctions as the leader of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which was formerly linked to al-Qaeda. The US removed HTS from a list of foreign terror groups in July.The UN also removed sanctions on Syrian Interior Minister Anas Khattab.Syria's foreign minister welcomed the removal of the sanctions, posting on social media: \"Syria expresses its appreciation to the United States and to friendly nations for their support of Syria and its people.\"Sharaa's White House visit on Monday comes after US President Donald Trump said the Syrian leader had made \"good progress\" towards bringing peace to the war-torn country.The pair met for the first time in May, when Trump visited Riyadh on a tour of the Middle East.After that meeting, the US president described Sharaa as a \"tough guy\" with a \"very strong past\".His Islamist group HTS was al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria until he severed ties in 2016.ReutersAfter the meeting, Trump said Sharaa had \"a real shot at pulling it together\"Monday's visit will not be Sharaa's first trip to the US this year. In September, he became the first Syrian leader to address the UN General Assembly in New York in almost 60 years.In his speech, he said Syria was \"reclaiming its rightful place among the nations of the world\" and expressed solidarity with the people of Gaza.",

    "body": "8 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporterCanada's top court has refused to hear an appeal to stop the cull of hundreds of ostriches at a farm in British Columbia, leaving the farmers with few legal options to prevent it.The cull was ordered by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) late last year after two birds tested positive for avian flu, following an outbreak that killed dozens of the animals.Universal Ostrich Farms has fought the order since, and the case has attracted international attention including from senior White House officials who have criticised it as an example of government overreach. The Supreme Court of Canada's decision means the cull can now legally go ahead. It is unclear, however, if the farmers will try to pursue other avenues to save the birds, such as asking the federal government to reconsider the order.Ostriches facing cull at Canada farm find unexpected alliesIn a statement following the Supreme Court dismissal on Thursday, the CFIA said it will be \"moving forward\" with the cull, but did not provide a timeline on when.It added that it \"expects the ostrich farm owners and supporters\" to respect the legal decision. Katie Pasitney, whose family owns the farm, reacted tearfully in a video posted on Facebook. \"Shame on you Canada,\" she said. \"Please pray for a miracle in the next hour for our family, for these animals outside,\" she added.The farmers have argued that the ostriches should be spared and used instead for scientific research, noting those that remain had survived the avian flu outbreak that killed 69 of the flock.The CFIA, on the other hand, has said that the birds should be killed because their exposure to the flu poses a risk to wildlife and humans. They also dispute the claim that the surviving birds have developed immunity to the virus.Lower courts have sided with the CFIA's order to cull the birds.The ostriches remain on the farm, but have been under the custody of the food inspection agency since late September. More than 60 protesters had gathered at the farm early on Thursday morning as the Supreme Court released its decision. The legal battle has also attracted support from US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, who met with CFIA officials in May to ask that the agency study the birds instead.Dr Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, offered to re-home the birds on his Florida ranch.Another supporter has been New York grocery billionaire John Catsimadtidis, who has spoken frequently about the plight of the ostriches on his radio show and revealed he was helping to fund the farm's legal battle.",

    "body": "7 hours agoNatalie ShermanAFP via Getty ImagesBoeing will avoid a criminal charge in the US linked to two deadly 737 Max crashes, after a court granted a request from the US government to dismiss the criminal case.In his ruling, Judge Reed O'Connor said he \"disagreed\" that dropping the charge was in the public interest but said his concerns did not give him sufficient reason to deny the proposal. The decision marks a major win for Boeing, which had agreed to plead guilty to the charge last year after the government accused it of violating a settlement related to the crashes.The dismissal had been opposed by some of the families of those killed in the accidents, who had sought to hold Boeing accountable at trial.Lawyer Paul Cassell, who represents some of the families, said he intended to appeal against the ruling.\"We believe that the courts don't have to stand silently by while an injustice is perpetrated,\" he said in a statement.In his decision on Thursday, Mr O'Connor said the government's concerns about taking the charge to trial were \"unserious\"and he did not believe the new deal reached between the government and Boeing would \"secure the necessary accountability to ensure the safety of the flying public\".But he said the government was presumed to be acting in \"good faith\" and he did not have the authority to override the request. The Department of Justice (DOJ) defended its agreement, noting that it had met \"extensively\" with the crash victims' families, which had expressed \"a broad set of views regarding the resolution\".\"Rather than allow for protracted litigation, this agreement provides finality for the victims and requires Boeing to act now,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. \"We are confident that this resolution is the most just outcome.\"Boeing said it was committed to the agreement struck with the DOJ. \"We are also committed to continuing the significant efforts we have made as a company to strengthen our safety, quality, and compliance programs,\" the company said in a statement.The decision marks the latest twist in a long-running legal battle stemming from two major 737 Max accidents in late 2018 off Indonesia and in Ethiopia in early 2019, which killed 346 people. The US subsequently charged Boeing with one count of criminal fraud conspiracy, accusing Boeing of deliberately concealing from regulators key information about its flight control software, which was implicated in the crashes. The firm admitted to the allegations but avoided prosecution with a 2021 deal in which it paid $2.5bn in fines and compensation and pledged to improve safety standards and compliance programmes.The case was reopened last year, after an incident in which an unused door fell off a 737 Max early in flight. The DOJ accused Boeing of having breached the terms of the original settlement.In 2024, under the Biden administration, the DOJ proposed a new deal in which Boeing would plead guilty to the fraud charge, pay a further fine of $243m and agree to a court-appointed monitor overseeing its operations for a set period.But Mr O'Connor rejected that deal last December, in part due to concerns over how the monitor would be selected.A new settlement put forward by prosecutors this year dropped the criminal charge, a black mark for Boeing that could have complicated its dealings with the government as a contractor. It still required the company to hire an \"independent compliance consultant\" and make $1.1bn financial commitments, including another $243m in penalties as well as additional compensation to family members of those killed in the crashes.In explaining their decision to dismiss the charge, prosecutors said Boeing had made \"meaningful progress\" this year in its anti-fraud and conspiracy programmes.

    "body": "7 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorFour senior figures in the Greek coastguard, including its current commander, are to face criminal prosecution for negligent manslaughter in connection with a 2023 migrant boat disaster in which up to 650 people are thought to have drowned.The fishing boat Adriana went down off the Greek coast near Pylos. Survivors told the BBC that the vessel capsized after coastguards made a botched attempt to tow it.Greek authorities have always denied any wrongdoing over the shipwreck.Now a prosecutor at the naval appeal court in Piraeus has recommended that the current head of the Hellenic coastguard, Vice Adm Tryfon Kontizas, and three other senior officers should go on trial.Among the charges cited by the court of appeal are manslaughter by negligence in international waters but within Greece's rescue zone, exposure by negligence with a legal obligation to rescue people that resulted in death and repeated exposure by omission of other people to danger.The Adriana had left Libya for Italy in June 2023 and was monitored by a Greek patrol vessel for some 15 hours off Pylos before it went down. Some of the 104 survivors later revealed that a coastguard vessel had caused the boat to sink by towing the boat away too fast when the boat was unbalanced.Although only 82 bodies were recovered, hundreds more people are believed to have died.Prosecutors at the maritime court in Piraeus decided earlier this year that 17 members of the Greek coastguard should face charges, including the captain of the coastguard ship, the-then head of the coastguard Vice Adm Giorgos Alexandrakis and the supervisor of the national search and rescue centre.However, they cleared Tryfon Kontizas and three other senior officers of blame. Vice Adm Kontizas had been appointed coastguard chief a few weeks before the court's decision.That decision not to prosecute the four officers was then challenged by lawyers for survivors and relatives of the victims.Greece has always maintained it fully respects human rights and has rescued more than 250,000 people at sea in the past decade.",

    "body": "8 hours agoPaul Njie,BBC Africa, Yaoundé and Mansur  AbubakarCameroon's 92-year-old President Paul Biya has promised to restore order in the country gripped by post-election violence, as he was sworn in for an eighth consecutive term in office.In his inaugural address, the world's oldest president offered condolences to victims of the protests and blamed those he called \"irresponsible politicians\" for the unrest.\"I can assure you, order will reign,\" he promised, saying it was pointless to plunge the country into crisis.Following allegations of fraud during last month's election, Biya described the electoral process as satisfactory and praised the electoral body Elecam.The nonagenarian won 54% of the vote, compared to the 35% of Issa Tchiroma Bakary, according to the official results. Tchiroma Bakary maintains he was the rightful winner of the poll and has accused the authorities of fraud, which they have denied.The announcement of the result led to deadly protests across the country, which saw at least 14 people killed and more than 1,200 arrested, according to the National Human Rights Commission. Other institutions have presented a far higher death toll.In his swearing-in speech at the country's parliament in the capital, Yaoundé, Biya congratulated the security forces for containing the protests but failed to address complaints of excessive use of force.He insisted the election was now in the past, urging citizens to work with him on building a \"united, stable, and prosperous\" country.The president promised to make issues affecting women and young people a priority, with a commitment to tackle corruption and security challenges which have marred his administration over the years.Biya first came into power in November 1982, after the resignation of President Ahmadou Ahidjo. His critics say he has ruled the country with an iron fist since then.Prior to the inauguration, several parts of the country were crippled by a general strike called by Tchiroma Bakary, especially in his strongholds of Garoua and Douala.He said he would resist until his \"victory\" was recognised, and went on to urge foreign powers to impose sanctions on Cameroonian officials over the recent crackdown on protests and complaints over electoral fraud.Judges at the Constitutional Council had dismissed eight complaints about the election, citing insufficient evidence of irregularities or a lack of jurisdiction to annul results.Tchiroma Bakary, leader of the National Salvation Front party, was a former government information minister who broke ranks with Biya to challenge him for power.He has refused to file an official complaint.",

    "body": "Busiest US airports to cut thousands of flights due to government shutdown27 minutes agoGrace Eliza Goodwin and Kwasi Gyamfi AsieduWashingtonWatch: \"This is not good\" - Airline travellers react to flight reductionsAir travel will be cut by up to 10% at 40 major airports, resulting in thousands of cancelled flights, in the coming days if the US government shutdown does not end, US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has warned. The decision, which is expected to affect domestic flights only, was made because air traffic controllers had been reporting fatigue, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said.Some 1.4 million federal workers, from air traffic controllers to park wardens, are working without pay - or are on forced leave - because the US Congress has not agreed to a funding budget.Major airports in Atlanta, New York and Washington DC will be affected by the reduction in service.Unions say many employees are becoming ill with stress or are being forced into taking second jobs. On Wednesday, the federal government funding impasse became the longest shutdown in US history.\"It is unusual,\" said FAA chief Bryan Bedford of the planned flight reductions, \"just as the shutdown is unusual, just as the fact that our controllers haven't been paid for a month is unusual.\"The flight reductions will be gradual, starting at 4% of domestic flights on Friday, then rising to 5% on Saturday and 6% on Sunday, before hitting the full 10% next week, Reuters news agency reported. Watch: \"There will be frustration\" - Transport secretary outlines reduction in air trafficThe names of the affected airports - all high-traffic locations - will officially be released on Thursday.A list shared by a source with the BBC's US partner CBS includes some of the nation's busiest hubs. They include Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, New York John F Kennedy International, Chicago O'Hare International, Ronald Reagan Washington National, and Los Angeles International airports. The BBC has contacted the FAA and the transportation department for the official list.The cancellations could affect between 3,500 and 4,000 flights per day. US media also reported that international flights would not be affected.Low budget carrier Frontier Airlines warned customers to buy tickets at other airlines as a contingency plan.The reduction in service is needed to ensure the US airspace remained safe for passengers, the FAA said.In a statement, American Airlines, the second-largest carrier in North America, said it was waiting for more information from the FAA so it could determine which flights will be scrapped, but that \"we expect the vast majority of our customers' travel will be unaffected\".Delta Air Lines told the BBC most of its flights would continue as scheduled, adding that all customers could change, cancel or refund their flights without penalty.Once government funds ran out on 1 October, most federal workers were sent home and told they would be paid once the government reopened. Those deemed essential, like controllers, though, had to keep doing their jobs without pay.Almost immediately after the shutdown started, airports began feeling the effects. Some had to ground flights for hours after air traffic controllers called out sick, while others relied on controllers from other airports.Duffy warned earlier this week that flight cancellations could be coming, as half the country's 30 major airports experienced staff shortages. Nick Daniels, the president of the labour union representing more than 20,000 aviation workers, put the situation into stark terms on Wednesday. \"Air traffic controllers are texting, 'I don't even have enough money to put gas in my car to come to work,'\" he told CNN. \"We base what we do day in and day out on predictability,\" he said. \"Right now there is no predictability.\"Writing recently for MSNBC, another controller, a single father, said he was working for food delivery service DoorDash after his daily air traffic shift ended, and was \"sleeping only two hours most nights\".\"Like many families, we didn't plan for a shutdown,\" he wrote. \"Yet the bills don't stop.\"Duffy previously said there was a risk that came with air traffic controllers taking on additional jobs during the shutdown, and had threatened to fire controllers who did not come to work.Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

    "body": "12 minutes agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology correspondentWatch: Tesla shareholders cheer Elon Musk's $1tn pay dealTesla boss Elon Musk has had a record-breaking pay package that could be worth nearly $1tn (£760bn) approved by shareholders.The unprecedented deal was approved by 75% of votes and drew huge applause from the audience at the firm's annual general meeting on Thursday.Musk, who is already the world's richest man, must drastically raise the electric car firm's market value over 10 years. If he does this and meets various targets, he will be rewarded with hundreds of millions of new shares.The scale of the potential payout has drawn criticism, but the Tesla board argued that Musk might leave the company if it was not approved - and that it could not afford to lose him.Following the announcement, Musk took to the stage in Austin, Texas and danced to chants of his name.\"What we're about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,\" he said.\"Other shareholder meetings are snoozefests but ours are bangers. Look at this. This is sick,\" he added.The milestones Musk must achieve over the next decade to maximise his payout include raising Tesla's market value to $8.5tn from $1.4tn at time of writing.He would also need to get a million self-driving Robotaxi vehicles into commercial operation.But his early remarks on Thursday placed the spotlight on the Optimus robot, dashing the hopes of some long-time analysts and Tesla watchers who want Musk to focus on reviving the company's electric vehicle business.ReutersElon Musk will get hundreds of millions of new shares if he hits his targets\"Let it sink in where Musk's head is at,\" wrote analyst Gene Munster, the managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, on X.\"His vision of the 'new book' starts with Optimus. No mention of cars, FDS and robotaxi yet.\"Later, Musk did refer to FSD, shorthand for full-self driving, saying the company was \"almost comfortable\" allowing drivers to \"text and drive essentially.\" US regulators are investigating Tesla's self-driving feature after multiple incidents, in which the cars drove through red lights or on the wrong side of the road, some resulting in crashes and injuries.Tesla shares were slightly higher in after hours trading but have risen more than 62% over the last six months.Sales have slid in the year since Musk aligned himself with US President Donald Trump - a relationship that disintegrated this past spring.Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives, a tech analyst who has been a long-time advocate of Musk's leadership of Tesla, called him \"Tesla's biggest asset\" in a note published after the vote.\"We continue to believe that the AI valuation is getting unlocked, and we believe the march to an AI driven valuation for TSLA over the next 6-9 months has now begun,\" Mr Ives added.ReutersMusk said everyone would want an Optimus robotTesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon MuskMusk already held 13% of Tesla shares. Shareholders had twice ratified a pay package worth tens of billions of dollars if he achieved a tenfold increase in the company's market value - which he did.But a Delaware judge rejected that pay deal on grounds that Tesla board members were too close to Musk.Tesla reincorporated from Delaware to Texas, and the Delaware Supreme Court is currently reviewing the lower court judge's decision.The new pay package was rejected by several major insitutional investors including Norway's sovereign wealth fund - the world's largest national wealth fund - and the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) - the biggest public pension fund in the United States. That left Musk more reliant on Tesla's unusually large volume of retail investors.Musk and his brother Kimbal, who also serves on the Tesla board, were both allowed to vote going into Thursdays meeting.In recent weeks, members of Tesla's board of directors have helped lobby for Musk's new pay package with a marketing blitz that riled some corporate governance experts.A video posted to votetesla.com showed board chair Robyn Denholm and director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson praising Musk.",

    "body": "Parts of Australia will face catastrophic fire conditions on Friday, when heatwaves are expected to hit most of the country.Severe to extreme heatwaves have been declared in every state and territory in Australia, except for Queensland, with high temperatures forecast for days.The state of Victoria has declared a total fire ban for Friday, as the fire danger rating will be set at \"catastrophic\" - the highest level. Some 450 schools and childcare centres will be closed.One meteorologist told the BBC that the combination of heatwaves and an elevated fire danger in parts of the country could create the most \"significant\" conditions since the devastating Black Summer bushfires.On Thursday, firefighters battled several blazes in Victoria and New South Wales (NSW), with a dozen planes carrying water called in to tackle a large fire near the city of Wodonga, the ABC reported.Melbourne experienced its hottest day in six years on Wednesday with a high of 40.9C (105.6F), while some coastal towns in Western Australia hit 49C.In NSW, the heatwave is expected to peak on Saturday with Sydney facing a high of 42C while areas of South Australia and Western Australia will see temperatures over 40C in the coming days. Friday will be the \"real peak of the current burst of heat,\" Angus Hines from the Bureau of Meteorology told the BBC.\"It will be a very hot day for almost all of South Australia, Victoria, most of New South Wales, parts of Tasmania\".Wednesday was the first significant heatwave for Melbourne and Adelaide, where millions of people live, with fire conditions set to worsen on Friday, he said.\"Firstly, the winds are strengthening across Victoria tomorrow,\" Hines said, adding that coupled with possible thunderstorms with little rain and dry lightning strikes, the fire danger will hit catastrophic levels for the northern parts of Victoria.\"This looks like the most significant event at a multi-day level for inland south-east Australia since 2019-2020,\" Hines said.That period six years ago saw Australia's most severe fire season on record, the so-called Black Summer where dozens of people died and thousands of hectares of land was burnt. In Victoria, authorities on Thursday warned that a catastrophic fire danger rating means potential blazes can be \"unpredictable and uncontrollable\".\"We need the community to play their role alongside our emergency services to protect lives and property,\" said Victoria's Emergency Management Commissioner Tim Wiebusch.\"Prepare now and enact your bushfire survival plan. If you are in an area of forecast catastrophic fire danger, leave early to an area with a lower fire risk.\"Australia's fire danger ratings scale has four levels, with catastrophic being the highest level, followed by extreme, high and low.A heatwave is declared when the minimum and maximum temperatures are expected to be unusually high for three days of more.",

    "body": "21 hours agoPaulin KolaReutersEmotions are still raw outside the barFamilies of the victims of a fire at a Swiss bar on New Year's Eve have expressed shock after officials admitted the venue had not undergone safety checks for five years.Romain Jordan, who represents some of the families, said the \"staggering number of breaches and shortcomings in the inspections raises the question of whether the municipality should be investigated with even greater urgency\".Other lawyers also urged officials to take responsibility for the disaster at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana in which 40 people died and 116 were injured. Prosecutors believe the fire started when champagne bottles with sparklers attached set light to sound-insulating foam on the ceiling. The two bar managers have been placed under criminal investigation, but not in custody. French couple Jacques and Jessica Moretti are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.In their first statement since the fire, they said they were \"devastated\" and pledged \"full co-operation\" with the investigation.Venues like Le Constellation should have been checked annually, but the mayor of Crans-Montana, Nicolas Feraud, said on Tuesday he could not explain why it hadn't been checked in so long. \"We regret that - we owe it to the families and we will accept the responsibility,\" he said.He added that sparklers would be banned in local venues.ReutersRicardo Minghetti, whose funeral was held on Wednesday, was one of eight victims under the age of 16More on this storyMost of the victims of the fire were young - eight under the age of 16.Many of the injured have severe burns and are being treated in Switzerland and other European countries.The funerals of some of those who died have been taking place.Watch: Ski bar not checked for five years and sparklers now banned, mayor saysUnder Switzerland's political system, power is distributed among three levels of the confederation, 26 cantons and then about 2,131 municipalities.While safety regulations are set by cantons, they need to be implemented by local authorities.

    "body": "7 hours agoSamantha GranvilleLos AngelesReality television star Spencer Pratt has launched a campaign for mayor of Los Angeles, vowing to \"expose the system\".His longshot bid for city hall comes on the anniversary of a wildfire that destroyed his home and became one of California's most destructive blazes on record. Pratt, 42, made the announcement while speaking at a \"They Let Us Burn\" rally organised by residents who lost houses in the Palisades Fire. The protest marked a year since the fire ignited in the Pacific Palisades on 7 January 2025, tearing through the wealthy coastal community tucked between the Santa Monica Mountains and the Pacific Ocean.Another blaze, the Eaton Fire, sparked hours later on the other side of the city. In total, 31 people were killed and more than 16,000 homes and businesses were destroyed.Pratt posted photos on his Instagram page showing him signing what appears to be official campaign paperwork, although his filing was not yet official.\"Business as usual is a death sentence for Los Angeles,\" he told Wednesday's demonstration, \"and I'm done waiting for someone to take real action. That's why I am running for mayor.\"But let me be clear, this just isn't a campaign. This is a mission, and we are going to expose the system. \"We are going into every dark corner of LA politics and disinfecting the city with our light.\"He and his wife, former reality TV star Heidi Montag, lost their Pacific Palisades home in the fire.Pratt has since emerged as a vocal critic of Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Governor Gavin Newsom over their handling of the disaster.Pratt rose to fame in the mid-2000s as a cast member on MTV's Laguna Beach spin-off The Hills, where his relationship with Montag became a central storyline. The couple wed in 2008 and have two children. They later appeared on I'm a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here and the UK edition of Celebrity Big Brother.Despite his fame, Pratt is a first-time candidate who faces long odds in a crowded field for June's non-partisan mayoral primary.Bass, who won the mayoralty in 2022 after defeating real estate developer Rick Caruso, is seeking re-election.More than a dozen other candidates have entered the race.",

    "body": "A British man living in Western Australia is set to be deported over claims that he was part of a well-known neo-Nazi group.Ryan Turner's visa was cancelled on character grounds and he was taken into immigration detention on Tuesday. He can appeal the decision to cancel his visa or voluntarily return to the UK.Turner is understood to be a member of the National Socialist Network, the same group that organised an anti-Jewish rally outside the New South Wales parliament last year. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said: \"Our government has zero tolerance for bigotry and hate. If you don't like Australia, you can leave.\"The BBC has contacted the UK Foreign Office for comment.Last year, Australia tightened its hate crime laws, introducing mandatory jail terms for displaying hate symbols or performing a Nazi salute.In recent months, police have been cracking down on the use of these symbols amid fears of rising antisemitism and right wing extremism. Several foreign nationals with links to Nazi ideology have had their visas revoked including South African man Matthew Gruter who was detained last November.Gruter was also a part of the National Socialist Network and took part in the neo-Nazi rally outside the New South Wales parliament. It is unclear if Turner attended.Gruter was pictured in the front row of the rally along with about 60 other men, all clad in black, with a banner saying \"abolish the Jewish lobby\".Attendees also reportedly chanted \"blood and honour\", a slogan associated with the Hitler Youth, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Gruter, who had lived in Australia since 2022 and worked as a civil engineer, returned to South Africa with his wife and young child, the ABC reported in early December. In another case, a British man living in Queensland was arrested and charged for allegedly using a social media account to post the Nazi swastika, promote pro-Nazi ideology and call for violence towards the Jewish community.Just before Christmas, the man who was identified in court documents as Kayn Adam Charles Wells, was placed in immigration detention in Brisbane after his visa was cancelled. He faced court earlier this week - where he is understood to have requested voluntary removal from Australia - with the case adjourned until February. Last month, days after two gunmen killed 15 people at a Jewish event at Bondi Beach, Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced a crackdown on hate speech with new laws to target \"those who spread hate, division and radicalisation\".The reforms also aim to give the home affairs minister new powers to cancel or refuse visas for those who spread hate.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has said he will meet his Colombian counterpart Gustavo Petro at the White House in the \"near future\", just days after saying an operation targeting Colombia \"sounds good\". The US seized the president of neighbouring Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, in a raid on Caracas on Saturday night.Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said on Wednesday the death toll in the raid was substantially higher than initially reported, with more than 100 people killed.Local media had previously reported that 23 Venezuelan and 32 Cuban soldiers died when US forces stormed Maduro's compound. During a call with Trump, Petro explained \"the situation of drugs and other disagreements\", the US president said, adding he appreciated the Colombian president's \"tone\". Earlier this week, Trump had issued a warning to Petro, telling him to \"watch his ass\".Colombia is a key hub for the region's drug trade - most notably cocaine - as well as having substantial oil reserves. It is also a major producer of gold, silver, emeralds, platinum and coal. The US has said it will control sales of Venezuelan oil \"indefinitely\" as it prepares to roll back restrictions on the country's crude in global markets, according to the White House.Speaking aboard Air Force One following the operation in Venezuela, Trump described Petro as a \"sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States\". Trump added: \"He's not going to be doing it for very long.\"In response, Petro warned that Colombia would \"take up arms\" if the US launched any military action against his country.\"If you detain a president whom much of my people want and respect, you will unleash the people's jaguar,\" Petro wrote on X.But writing on his Truth Social platform late on Wednesday, Trump described his conversation with Petro as a \"Great Honor\", and said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Colombian counterpart would make arrangements for Petro to travel to Washington.The US imposed sanctions on Petro in October, saying he was failing to curb drug trafficking and was allowing cartels to \"flourish\".At the time, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that since Petro came to power in 2022, cocaine production in Colombia had \"exploded to the highest rate in decades, flooding the United States and poisoning Americans\".Petro responded he had been fighting drug trafficking \"for decades\" and that his administration had stemmed the growth of coca crops.Like Venezuela, Colombia is home to substantial oil reserves.Meanwhile, Venezuela's interim president Delcy Rodríguez said the US action to depose Maduro was a \"stain on our relations such as had never occurred in our history\". But she added: \"Venezuela is open to energy relations where all parties benefit.\"",

    "body": "Crowds lined the streets of Saint-Tropez for the funeral of French film legend Brigitte Bardot on Wednesday.Some of those gathered were seen applauding as her coffin was driven through the French Riviera town after a service in a local church.Among the guests at the service were far-right politician Marine le Pen and Equality Minister Aurore Bergé, who like Bardot, is a defender of animal rights. The actress was later buried at a hillside cemetery overlooking the Mediterranean.Bardot, who revolutionised 1950s French cinema and became a symbol of sexual liberation, died of cancer aged 91 three days after Christmas.Bardot had left instructions that her funeral be conducted without fanfare or ostentation - but the people of Saint-Tropez wanted to pay her a proper adieu on Wednesday.Screens were set up in the small fishing town that was transformed by Bardot's fame into a playground for the jet set.Bardot's only son Nicolas-Jacques Charrier was among those carrying the coffin to the cemetery where the actress' parents and first husband Roger Vadim are buried. After her death, French President Emmanuel Macron said the nation was mourning \"a legend of the century\", while the Brigitte Bardot Foundation remembered her as a \"world-renowned actress\". The cinema icon - \"BB\" as she was known in her home country - acted in almost 50 films, including And God Created Woman, but retired in 1973 to devote her life to animal welfare.Later in life, Bardot's reputation was damaged after she made homophobic slurs and was fined multiple times for inciting racial hatred.Her right-wing views alienated her from many in the political establishment.",

    "body": "A spell of freezing weather bringing heavy snowfall and ice has caused transport disruption across western Europe.Hundreds of flights have been cancelled at several airports, while Eurostar services and haulage have also been affected.More than 700 flights were cancelled at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, a major regional transport hub, on Wednesday. Meanwhile, France's civil aviation authority has asked airlines to cut 40% of flights scheduled for the main international airport in Paris.At least six people have died in weather-related incidents across Europe this week -five in France and one in Bosnia.Dutch national airline KLM warned Schiphol Airport was close to running out of de-icing fluid after days of freezing conditions.Spokesperson Stephan Donker told news agency Reuters that it was an \"exceptional situation\" at the Dutch airport, where more than 1,000 travellers spent the night.A few hundred beds have been set up there before and after security checks with food and drinks also provided, he said.Donker warned of knock-on effects from the disruption, with further delays and cancellations possible in coming days.In Paris, more than 100 flights were cancelled at Charles de Gaulle airport and 40 more at Orly.Dozens of fllights have been delayed or cancelled in and out of Heathrow and Brussels.Some Eurostar rail services between London and Paris were delayed or cancelled on Wednesday. Almost half of mainland France was on alert for heavy snow and black ice, with lorries banned from the roads in some areas.\"It's better to be here than stuck on the road,\" driver Carle Bruno told news agency AFP at a roadside service station in the northern port of Le Havre.Five people died in two separate regions of France earlier this week as a result of treacherous driving conditions, authorities said, while a woman was also killed in Bosnia's capital, Sarajevo, after 40cm (16in) of snow fell on the city.In Paris, Guinean teenager Boubacar Camara, sleeping in a tent on the outskirts of the city, told AFP he had \"no choice but to keep on going\".\"You just have to stay strong [and] make sure you don't die,\" the 19-year-old said. \"We can't do anything about the cold. I'm not used to this at all.\"The rare sight of the French capital covered in snow drew residents and tourists out to ski down the slopes of Montmartre and along the Champs de Mars gardens below the Eiffel Tower.\"It's exceptional, it's incredible,\" said Pierre, a Parisian. \"It's magnificent and we're enjoying it. We also came across a lot of tourists and they look so happy.\" ",

    "body": "6 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterPresident Donald Trump has called for US defence spending to be increased to $1.5tn (£1.1tn) in 2027 for what he called \"these very troubled and dangerous times\".That would be more than 50% higher than this year's $901bn budget, which was approved by Congress in December.\"This will allow us to build the 'Dream Military' that we have long been entitled to and, more importantly, that will keep us SAFE and SECURE, regardless of foe,\" Trump said on social media on Wednesday.In separate posts, the president said he would crack down on payouts to bosses and shareholders of major US defence contractors unless the firms speed up deliveries of armaments and build new manufacturing plants.Shares in major US defence equipment makers Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon rose by more than 5% in extended trading in New York trade after Trump made the announcements.Economists have previously warned that the gap between US spending and its income has reached unsustainable levels.But Trump said Washington can \"easily hit\" his proposed $1.5tn defence budget thanks to money being brought in by tariffs.Trump has been pushing for higher defence spending by the US and its allies since his first term in the White House.He said in another post on Wednesday that military equipment is not being made quickly enough and urged companies to build new and modern plants.Defence companies are issuing \"massive\" payouts to shareholders and stock buybacks at the expense of investing into production, Trump said. He also criticised the \"exorbitant\" pay packages of executives at arms manufacturers.\"No Executive should be allowed to make in excess of $5 Million Dollars which, as high as it sounds, is a mere fraction of what they are making now.\"In a separate post, Trump singled out Raytheon, saying it was the \"least responsive\" to America's defence needs and the slowest to increase production.\"Either Raytheon steps up and starts investing in more upfront Investment like Plants and Equipment, or they will no longer be doing business with the Department of War,\" Trump wrote in a separate post.The BBC has contacted Raytheon for comment.Trump's call for much higher defence spending comes as geo-political tensions have increased around the world.On Wednesday, the US military captured a Russian-flagged oil tanker suspected to have violated US sanctions.It came after US forces seized Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro at the weekend and took him to America to face drug trafficking charges.In December, China held military drills around Taiwan simulating the seizure and blockade of the island's key areas, as a warning against \"separatist forces\".Taiwan's push to ramp up its defence this year has also angered Beijing, which claims the self-ruled island as its territory.",

    "body": "2 hours agoDanny AeberhardandYang TianUS President Donald Trump has withdrawn the US from dozens of international organisations, including many that work to combat climate change.Among the 66 groups, nearly half of them are bodies of the United Nations, including the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change - a treaty that underpins all international efforts to combat global warming.The White House said the decision was taken because those entities \"no longer serve American interests\" and promote \"ineffective or hostile agendas\".Trump has already stripped many multilateral organisations he dislikes of funds and previously rejected the scientific consensus of man-made climate change as a \"hoax\".The memorandum was signed on Wednesday after a review into causes that the White House said were \"a waste of taxpayer dollars\".\"These withdrawals will end American taxpayer funding and involvement in entities that advance globalist agendas over US priorities,\" it said in a statement.It added that many of the organisations promoted \"radical climate policies, global governance and ideological programs that conflict with US sovereignty and economic strength\".The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an expert body that assesses climate science worldwide, was also included on the list.Other UN organisations affected included those working on peace and democracy, family planning, maternal and child health, and sexual violence in conflict.While the US Constitution allows presidents to join treaties \"provided two thirds of Senators present concur\", it does not specify what happens if they were to withdraw, which means Trump's move could face legal challenges.A member of a US-based non-profit advocacy group, the Union of Concerned Scientists, described the step as a \"new low\".Senior policy director Rachel Cleetus told AFP news agency it was another sign that the administration, which she described as \"authoritarian\" and \"anti- science\", was determined to sacrifice people's wellbeing and destabilise global cooperation.Last year, Trump once again withdrew the US from the Paris climate agreement - the world's most important effort to tackle rising temperatures - and declined to send a delegation to the COP30 climate summit in Brazil.",

    "body": "Russian attacks left Ukraine's southeastern regions of Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia almost entirely without power, the country's energy ministry said on Wednesday night. Critical infrastructure was \"operating on reserve power\", it said in a statement on Telegram, while officials said water supplies and the internet were also disrupted. Russia has recently intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, aimed at paralysing power supplies during a harsh winter.\"Ukraine's energy system is under enemy attacks every day, and energy workers are operating in extremely difficult conditions to provide people with light and heat,\" Ukraine's Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko wrote on Telegram.\"Deteriorating weather conditions put additional strain on critical infrastructure,\" she said.The disruptions to power and heating have come as temperatures plunge. \"Emergency restoration work in the regions affected by the attack will begin immediately as soon as the security situation allows,\" state energy company Ukrenergo said on Telegram. It added: \"The primary task of energy workers is to restore critical infrastructure.\"Dnipro city Mayor Borys Filatov said on Telegram all city hospitals had been completely switched to generators. \"There are the necessary water supplies, the treatment process does not stop. Water drainage in houses is also supported by alternative power sources,\" Filatov said.School holidays had been extended until 9 January because of the power cuts, he added. The head of the Zaporizhzhia regional administration, Ivan Fedorov, said everything possible was being done to restore power.\"At this time, water utility workers have almost restored water to our homes, despite the fact that there is a complete blackout in the region,\" Fedorov said in a video message published on Telegram.DTEK, Ukraine's biggest private energy provider, is living in permanent crisis mode because of Russian attacks on the grid, its chief executive told the BBC last month, with most of Ukraine suffering from lengthy power cuts during winter.Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, which provides power for 5.6 million Ukrainians, said the intensity of strikes had been so frequent \"we just don't have time to recover\".As the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion approaches, Timchenko said Russia had repeatedly targeted DTEK's energy grid with \"waves of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles\" and his company had found it difficult to cope.The attacks come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said European allies have not given him sound guarantees that they will protect his country in the event of new Russian aggression.Following talks in Paris on Tuesday, the UK and France signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops in Ukraine if a peace deal is made with Russia.Moscow has repeatedly warned that any foreign troops in Ukraine would be a \"legitimate target\".",

    "body": "A high-powered lawyer for Nick Reiner, who is charged with murdering his Hollywood director father Rob Reiner and mother Michele, has withdrawn from the case.It emerged that Alan Jackson would no longer represent Nick Reiner during a court hearing, though the attorney said afterwards that he believed his now-former client was innocent.Reiner, 32, did not enter a plea to charges of first-degree murder of his parents during a brief appearance at Los Angeles Superior Court.The Reiners were found dead with stab wounds on 14 December in the bedroom of their home in Brentwood, Los Angeles.Jackson said outside court after Wednesday's hearing that he had left the case.\"Circumstances beyond my control, but more importantly circumstances beyond Nick's control, have made it impossible for us to continue our representation,\" he told reporters.\"I'm legally and ethically prohibited from explaining the reasons why.\"The lawyer, who has previously represented Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey, added that Reiner was not guilty of murder.But LA County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said otherwise outside court.\"We are fully confident that a jury will convict Nick Reiner beyond a reasonable doubt of the brutal murder of his parents - Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner,\" said the prosecutor.The accused will now be represented in court by a public defender.To qualify for a publicly funded attorney, defendants must show they lack the means to fund their legal case.Rob Reiner's net worth was estimated at $200m (£150m) and it is unclear who was paying the retainer for his son's high-powered attorney. The accused has a brother and sister.When asked by the judge if he understood that he was waiving his right to enter a plea on Wednesday, Reiner said: \"Yeah, I agree with it.\"The defendant smiled a few times during the hearing as he spoke to sheriffs' deputies.His new lawyer, public defender Kimberly Greene, met Reiner and asked for time to prepare for the case before her new client entered a plea.The next hearing is set for 23 February.Rob Reiner, 78, directed a handful of iconic films in a variety of genres, including This is Spinal Tap, Misery and A Few Good Men.Michele Singer Reiner, 70, was an actress, photographer and producer.Watch: \"I'm learning about being a parent\" - Rob Reiner talks to the BBC's Tim Sebastian in 1998",

    "body": "15 hours agoJessica ParkerBerlin correspondentBBCLena's family have been cooking on a camping stovePower is being restored to the last homes hit by a five-day blackout in Germany's snow-covered capital, Berlin.The outage was caused by a suspected arson attack and came as temperatures dipped below freezing.It is reportedly the longest blackout in the capital's post-war history. A far-left militant group has claimed it was behind the outage.This week's images of residents - young and old - living through a prolonged blackout in the country's capital has reignited a debate about Germany's vulnerability to sabotage attacks, whether by domestic or foreign actors.Schools, hospitals and care homes are among the tens of thousands of properties that were affected in south-west Berlin.In Berlin's Steglitz-Zehlendorf district, on Mexikoplatz, a police van drove around announcing the imminent return of power over a tannoy.Residents regularly approached a group of emergency service workers for the latest information.Lena said her family had felt \"lost\" - relying on a battery-powered radio for updates.They have been cooking on a camping stove at home while trying to make sure their water pipes didn't freeze.Reinhold, 79, was still without power on Wednesday morning and going to his daughter's house to get warm.\"But I always came back to sleep here even in the cold weather with a bobble hat on and sweater and a woollen blanket.\"The retired architect said that he was used to hardship having been born in post-war Germany.\"I was born in 1947. When my mother and I came from the hospital... it was -20C in our shack.\"My parents took turns every hour to see whether my hands were tucked in under the cover so my fingers wouldn't freeze off.\"Reinhold has been sleeping in a woolly hat to keep warm at nightRestoring electricity was happening on a \"step-by-step basis\", said fire service spokesman Adrian Wentzel.Resources have been pulled in from across Germany, he told the BBC, with an estimated 100,000 people affected.Hospitals have had to rely on emergency generators while some schools have had to close.It was early on Saturday when several cables on a bridge were spotted burning near the Lichterfelde gas-fired power plant.Subsequently, the far-left Vulkangruppe - or Volcano Group - appeared to claim responsibility, saying its target was the fossil energy industry.\"We apologise to the less wealthy people in the south-west of Berlin,\" a lengthy statement read.\"With the many owners of villas in these districts, our sympathy is limited,\" it added, likely referring to the fact that Steglitz-Zehlendorf is one of Berlin's wealthiest neighbourhoods.However, a different statement was later published online on the Indymedia site - purportedly from Vulkangruppe's founders.\"We expressly distance ourselves from all actions of recent years,\" it said.AFP via Getty ImagesTraffic lights were cut off, tooAnother recent high-profile incident saw activists admit being behind a suspected arson attack that halted production at the huge Tesla factory just outside Berlin in 2024.The exact structure and workings of Vulkangruppe is unclear, but German authorities describe them as left-wing extremists and say attacks have happened at irregular intervals since 2011 in Berlin and the surrounding state of Brandenburg.Domestic intelligence state that the group's aim is to disrupt \"the day-to-day functions in order to harm the hated capitalist system\".Federal prosecutors are investigating the latest incident as a terrorism offence, with possible charges including \"membership in a terrorist organisation, sabotage, arson and disruption of public services\".This week's outage was larger and lasted longer than a similar incident in September.Plans for a federal law to protect critical infrastructure have been in the works for years but were only presented to the German parliament in November.The \"Kritis\" bill sets out plans to identify key critical infrastructure transport as well as introduce minimum protection standards.",

    "body": "16 hours agoPaulin KolaReutersThe war in Ukraine is nearing its fourth anniversaryUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says European allies have not given him sound guarantees that they will protect his country in the case of a new Russian aggression.\"I am asking this very question to all our partners and I have not received a clear, unambiguous answer yet,\" he told reporters on Wednesday.His comments come a day after the UK and France signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops in Ukraine if a peace deal to end the war with Russia is agreed.But full security guarantees have not been agreed. The US, which has been leading efforts to end the invasion, reportedly did not sign such a pledge at talks in Paris on Tuesday.After the Paris talks, which included some 30 countries that form the so-called Coalition of the Willing, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the UK and France would \"establish military hubs across Ukraine\" to deter future invasion, while French President Emmanuel Macron later said thousands of troops may be deployed.Allies proposed that the US would take the lead in monitoring a truce. But the key issue of territorial concessions that Ukraine is being asked to grant to Russia as part of the peace proposals are still being discussed.Moscow has not yet commented on the announcement made in the French capital.Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.Sir Keir described the joint statement as \"a vital part of our commitment to stand with Ukraine for the long-term\".He added: \"It paves the way for the legal framework under which British, French and partner forces could operate on Ukrainian soil, securing Ukraine's skies and seas, and regenerating Ukraine's armed forces for the future.\"Zelensky hailed that agreement as a \"huge step forward\".A day later, however, he appeared less optimistic.\"I see the will, the political will, and that the partners are ready, and the partners are ready to give us strong sanctions, strong security guarantees,\" he said when asked if European countries would defend Ukraine.\"But as long as we don't have such security guarantees - legally binding, supported by parliaments, supported by the United States Congress - this question cannot be answered. And even if they do, you still have to rely primarily on your own strength.\"The Paris talks were also notable owing to the presence of US President Donald Trump's peace envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner.Witkoff said the allies \"largely finished\" their work on agreeing security protocols.EPA/ShutterstockRussia continues to strike Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure across the country on a daily basisLast week, Zelensky said a peace deal was \"90% ready\". Territorial concessions and security guarantees have been at the forefront of unresolved issues for negotiators.Putin has repeatedly warned that Ukrainian troops must withdraw from all of Ukraine's eastern Donbas or Russia will seize it, rejecting any compromise over how to end the war.Zelensky has so far ruled out ceding any territory, but has suggested that Ukraine could withdraw its troops to an agreed point - but only if Russia did the same.Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions form the industrial Donbas region.It has been intensifying attacks against Ukrainian cities - particularly targeting energy infrastructure. Russia has also made slow progress in capturing more Ukrainian territory.Ukraine has hit back at Russian targets with drones, albeit with more limited success.",

    "description": "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced a royal commission, the country's most powerful form of independent inquiry, into last month'",
    "body": "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced a royal commission, the country's most powerful form of independent inquiry, into last month's shooting at Bondi Beach. The attack targeting a Jewish festival left 15 people dead, making it one of the deadliest in the country's history.Albanese had previously argued that reforms on gun ownership and hate speech, steps to tackle antisemitism and a review into intelligence and law enforcement agencies offered the quickest response.But following weeks of public pressure, he said on Thursday that a royal commission was the best way forward after he had taken \"the time to reflect\" and meet with the Jewish community.\"I've repeatedly said that our government's priority is to promote unity and social cohesion, and this is what Australia needs to heal, to learn, to come together in a spirit of national unity,\" he told reporters in Canberra. \"It's clear to me that a royal commission is essential to achieving this.\"Since the 14 December attack, the families of the victims, as well as a chorus of public figures, including lawyers, business people and athletes had led an almost daily campaign calling for him to reverse course and launch a royal commission.A royal commission has broad powers to investigate, the ability to summon witnesses and compel agencies to produce documents. It can also offer legal protections to whistleblowers.The commission will examine four key areas, Albanese said. They comprise:investigating the \"nature and prevalence of antisemitism\" and its \"key drivers\" in Australiamaking recommendations to enforcement, border immigration and security agencies to tackle antisemitism examining the circumstances surrounding the Bondi attackmaking any other recommendations for strengthening social cohesion and countering the spread of ideological and religiously motivated extremismThe prime minister said the work of Dennis Richardson, the former spy chief leading a review into intelligence and law enforcement agencies, would be wrapped into the royal commission, with an interim report expected in April.Former High Court justice Virginia Bell has been appointed to lead the commission, Albanese said, adding that he had asked her to report by December 2026 and that \"this won't be a drawn-out process.\" Previous royal commissions have taken years.\"This royal commission is the right format, the right duration and the right terms of reference to deliver the right outcome for our national unity and our national security,\" Albanese said.Rumours that Bell was to be appointed had earlier drawn criticism from the Jewish community. Former treasurer Josh Frydenberg said prior to Albanese's announcement the prime minister had been told by Jewish leaders there were \"serious concerns\" about her appointment, without specifying what they were.Speaking alongside Albanese, Attorney General Michelle Rowland said Bell was \"an eminent and highly capable former Justice of the High Court of Australia, and I have no doubt that she will examine the complex issues ahead with impartiality and precision\".Addressing concerns that a royal commission could interfere with the criminal legal proceedings against the alleged gunman who survived, Albanese added: \"It's one of the reasons why we chose someone who has a criminal law background, has been in senior positions in the Supreme Court and the High Court of Australia. That is, she's the most qualified person we could possibly consider.\"He also added that the inquiry was not meant to \"provide a solution on Gaza or on the Middle East\".\"The truth is that some people have held Jewish Australians to account for views or actions that that they're opposed to, that have nothing to do with them,\" Albanese said.In the days after the attack, state and federal leaders agreed to tighten gun controls, including limits on the number of firearms held by any one individual and on the types of firearms that can be held, as well as a buyback scheme.Albanese also promised hate speech reform including penalties for preachers and leaders who promote violence and a new federal offence of \"aggravated hate speech\".He previously said his government would adopt the recommendations put forward by antisemitism commissioner Jillian Segal in a July report.Her report was criticised by some upon its release due to its implications for free speech, such as plans to monitor universities and arts organisations and withhold funding if they were deemed to have failed to act against antisemitism.Speaking alongside the prime minister on Thursday, Segal said the government's decision was \"the right one and an important one\". \"It does reflect the seriousness of the growth in antisemitism and its impact on our country and our democracy,\" she said.",

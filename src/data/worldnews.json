    "body": "1 day agoWill GrantCuba correspondent in HavanaBBCA sizeable exhibit in the Museum of the Revolution in Havana is dedicated to conditions in Cuba before the revolution took power in 1959. Inside the ornate former presidential palace, photographs and oral testimony detail the grinding poverty and ingrained corruption of the dictatorship of Cuba's then-military strongman, Fulgencio Batista.The enduring image is of a woman in a dirt-floored palm-leaf hut cooking with firewood. Similar pictures appear in state museums across the island from the Bay of Pigs to Birán, the birthplace of the father of the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro. The inference is clear: the revolutionaries saved Cubans from the ignorance and hardship of life under a Washington-backed de facto leader and led them to dignity, education and true independence.Yet today, Lisandra Botey identifies more with the impoverished woman in the photograph than with the revolutionaries who liberated her country from Batista.\"We're living like that now, we're exactly like that\", says housewife Lisandra outside her home in Havana, which is cobbled together with pieces of sheet metal and wood.\"Every morning, we have to go down to the beach [in Havana] and look for firewood. Then we bring it home to cook breakfast with – because if we get power, it comes on during school hours.\"Lisandra says she identifies with the impoverished woman in the photograph from pre-revolution CubaLisandra's nine-year-old daughter set off for school that morning with nothing in her stomach, she explains, tears pricking her eyes. Her husband, Brenei Hernández – a construction worker with next to no work – says they often have no idea where the next meal is coming from.\"Every day is the same hunger, the same misery\", he says, stirring a pot of white rice – so at the very least his daughter will come home from school to something hot to eat.With the Cuban economy in freefall since the coronavirus pandemic, no gas has been delivered to Brenei's flimsy home in a Havana suburb for months. He and his neighbours were already cooking with firewood and charcoal before US troops forcibly removed Cuba's closest ally, the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, from power on 3 January. Since then, though, Washington has seemingly taken full control of Venezuela's oil industry and the supply of crude to the communist-run island has dried up.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesBy 1958, the revolution had spread throughout Cuba, culminating in the fall of Havana in early 1959The decades-long US economic embargo on Cuba has been ramped up like never before: US President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs on any nation which sends oil to the stricken island.None of Cuba's traditional allies – whether Mexico, Russia, China, Vietnam or Iran – have stepped up to fill the void left by Venezuela, although the US Treasury this week said it would relax restrictions on a limited number of oil sales, to \"support the Cuban people for commercial and humanitarian use.\"The move comes amid rising tensions between Washington and Havana. Cuba's government has reported that its border guards fatally shot four people travelling in a US‑registered speedboat. It said the individuals were Cuban nationals living in the United States. According to a US official, at least one American citizen was shot dead and another injured by Cuban officials intercepting the speedboat.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US was investigating the \"highly unusual\" incident. \"Washington's old playbook on Cuba doesn't apply anymore and whoever hasn't appreciated that yet is in for a shock,\" says Cuban economist, Ricardo Torres. \"Trump is changing the rules of the game.\"Trump has declared that \"Cuba is ready to fall\", intensifying pressure on the island at its most vulnerable moment since the Cold War. Some commentators have said one of the aims of Washington's removal of Maduro in Venezuela was to deepen Cuba's economic crisis. It appears the Trump administration hopes to weaken the revolution – possibly terminally – and push for the collapse of state-run socialism on the island.The underlying calculation is straightforward: that a worsening internal crisis could create the conditions for the Cuban Revolution to unravel from within. What remains far less certain is whether such a strategy will force regime change, or whether the communist-run Cuban government will, as it has in past crises, find new ways to endure.Blackouts and 'extreme rationing'The effects of the fuel crisis are being felt the length and breadth of Cuba.Blackouts in Havana can last for 15 hours a day or more. Hospitals are in darkness with only emergency cases being admitted. Schools are often shuttered. Rubbish is piled high on street corners with no fuel for the state's garbage trucks to collect it. Scrawny and elderly residents can often be found sifting through the discarded waste.Watch: BBC examines life in Cuba without electricity and gasolineFor an island proud of the social safety net it built for its people since 1959 – universal healthcare, the eradication of illiteracy, tackling infant mortality rates and preventable diseases – the picture is bleak, and getting worse.One constant question since Maduro's arrest is: how long can Cuba hold on without new fuel supplies reaching the island?\"Perhaps the oil inventories could last for six to eight weeks,\" suggests Ricardo Torres – but he admits it's hard to know with any degree of precision. \"Cuba doesn't publish figures on fuel inventories.\"\"Extreme rationing\" could be introduced, he says, but draconian restrictions are already in place. People are limited to 20 litres of fuel at the petrol pumps, which must be paid for in US dollars.They're obliged to use a government-run app called Ticket. But the wait can last for days, even weeks. Drivers are finding more than 10,000 people ahead of them when they join the virtual queue for half a tank of petrol. Unsurprisingly in such circumstances, the price of black-market fuel has skyrocketed.AFP via Getty ImagesThere is a limit of 20 litres of fuel at the petrol pumps, which must be paid for in US dollarsDespite it all, Brenei Hernández doesn't direct his ire at Washington. Quite the opposite, in fact: he blames the Cuban state.\"I'd like Trump to take this place over. Then let's see if things get better,\" he says with unerring honesty. \"What can I tell you? I'm not going to lie,\" he adds.Regime changeHaving spent years listening to Cubans repeat anodyne revolutionary slogans when asked for their opinions on camera, it's disarming to hear such frank views expressed with no outward fear of the repercussions. Such is the level of disgust and exhaustion, the public's fear of reprisals for speaking out is beginning to evaporate.\"It's too much,\" Brenei says. \"We're only eating white rice. Hopefully I can get enough money together in the next couple of days for a packet of hot dogs, or three or four eggs.\"Lisandra already worries that her daughter will want a birthday cake this year, which is well beyond their means.\"Every day is the same hunger, the same misery,\" says Brenei HernándezSuch suffering may be part of the Trump administration's strategy of \"maximum pressure\" on Cuba. But while the methodology may be new, says Ricardo Torres, Washington's ultimate goal in Cuba remains the same as always: regime change.\"Whether the change in Cuba is something very sudden or a negotiated solution, in the end, it's regime change that Trump wants.\"The issue for Cubans is how Washington intends to make that change happen, Torres adds, with more acute pain from the oil shutout on the horizon.The Cuban government has repeatedly described the policy as inhumane, cruel and illegal under international law: \"What right does a world power have to deny fuel and the ability to function to a smaller nation?\" said Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel.It's all a far cry from the optimism of Washington's Cuba policy of a decade ago. After decades of enmity, in 2014 President Barack Obama opted to re-establish ties with the island in a historic but short-lived thaw. Hardliners in the Cuban government warned that Obama's overtures amounted to the same aim of regime change dressed up in nicer clothing. For the ordinary Cubans who lived through it, though, the diplomatic reset felt like the polar opposite of the current Trump approach.AFP via Getty ImagesIn 2014 President Barack Obama opted to re-establish ties with CubaNext month marks the tenth anniversary of Obama's visit to Havana as the first sitting US president to step foot on the island in almost a century.In front of the Cuban leader, Raúl Castro, he delivered an extraordinary address – broadcast live on state television – in which he said he had come to \"bury the last remnant of the Cold War in the Americas\" and \"extend the hand of friendship to the Cuban people\".The man who oversaw the diplomatic thaw was the then-US ambassador to Cuba, Jeffrey DeLaurentis. I asked him whether the Cuban Revolution was now facing an existential threat.\"That will depend upon what some other countries might do\", DeLaurentis replied.Venezuela's oil support was worth some 35,000 barrels of crude a day to Cuba. There have been some broad indications that Russia might send oil to the island and the Cuban foreign minister, Bruno Rodríguez, was recently in Moscow for talks with his Russian counterpart and with Russian President Vladimir Putin. So far, though, no Russian fuel tankers have docked in Cuban ports.Rodríguez also travelled to China, Vietnam and Spain trying to drum up support.Getty ImagesUS troops forcibly removed Cuba's closest ally, the Venezuelan president, Maduro, from power on 3 January\"The rush to defend and help has certainly not been as enthusiastic and as significant as we've seen in the past. But there's still a chance that other countries might take some action,\" says DeLaurentis.As to what Trump specifically wants in Cuba, the former lead US diplomat on the island says the administration is \"trying to take coercive steps to bring the government to the table or capitulate but not necessarily collapse\".\"That's a pretty risky strategy it seems to me, with a lot of potential for unintended consequences,\" he adds.Those consequences are already visible in the rapidly worsening humanitarian crisis which prompted Mexico to send tonnes of emergency aid to Cuba, including powdered milk and personal hygiene items. They're already being felt every day by the families forced to cook with firewood and the drivers in urgent need of petrol.Esteban Bello Rodríguez runs several \"almendrones\", 1950s classic American automobiles, in which he ferries tourists around the iconic spots of Havana. His trade has been heavily impacted by the fuel scarcity and the fall in tourism.Esteban Bello Rodríguez's trade has been heavily impacted by the fuel scarcity\"There's a problem here – the fuel problem – so surely the people at the top on both sides have to sit down, figure it out,\" he says bluntly. \"All I know is that a solution must be found because this is affecting the entire country – the people, nationwide. All of us.\"The real powerOn the US side, Cuba policy is largely being led by the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio – a Cuban-American son of exiles and former Florida senator.Trump says Rubio is talking to the top tier of the Cuban government and for days there's been widespread speculation over who might lead that negotiation on the Cuban side. Cuban economist Ricardo Torres says that the only dealmaker on the island is Raúl Castro, even at the revolutionary leader's advanced age of 94.AFP via Getty ImagesTrump says Marco Rubio is talking to the top tier of the Cuban government \"The only people with capacity to engage in a meaningful negotiation are people close to Raúl. The civilian government doesn't have any real power – including President Miguel Díaz-Canel\", he argues.\"The real power in Cuba is Raúl and the closed circle around him.\"Last week, the Axios news outlet reported that his grandson, Raúl Rodríguez Castro – commonly known in Cuba as \"El Cangrejo\", meaning The Crab – is the Trump administration's point of contact inside Castro's inner circle. If so, he's considered one of his grandfather's most trusted confidantes, having been his personal bodyguard, and more business-orientated than ideological, with no high-level diplomatic experience. Neither side, especially not the Cubans, have confirmed he's in talks with Rubio.\"In the case of Venezuela, the Trump administration has been very pragmatic,\" adds Torres.Rubio has seemingly been happy to deal with an interim government in Caracas under Delcy Rodríguez and Washington appears to be looking to persuade the conservative Cuban-American lobby in Florida of the benefits of negotiating with a similarly defenestrated regime in Havana.However, despite the public adherence to the \"maximum pressure\" strategy, Washington does seem to fear that total political change overnight in Venezuela or Cuba would be profoundly destabilising and could prompt a migration crisis as well as humanitarian one.AFP via Getty ImagesRubbish is often left uncollected on street cornersSeveral Cuba watchers have noted that Rubio's tone towards the island was markedly softer in recent comments he made at the Munich Security Conference, with an emphasis on economic reforms rather than a root-and-branch political transformation.\"In a way it almost sounded like a strange variant of Obama 2.0 in terms of economic reforms and so forth,\" said former ambassador DeLaurentis. \"That signalled to me that they are looking for a Delcy-like figure to negotiate with.\"\"Ten to 20 years ago, the diaspora in south Florida would have been completely opposed to that kind of approach. But I guess that now they'd give the president and the secretary the benefit of the doubt, and allow this sort of scenario to play out,\" adds DeLaurentis.Meanwhile, any visitor wanting to see the photograph of the pre-revolutionary woman cooking with firewood will have to wait. The museum has been closed for over a year for refurbishments and now there's no fuel to continue the work.In what is now the most challenging time in the island's modern history, it's not yet clear if only the Museum of the Revolution will be undergoing a renovation this year – or the Cuban Revolution itself.Top picture credit: AFP via Getty ImagesMore from InDepthBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "1 day agoCherylann MollanGetty ImagesKejriwal was arrested in a corruption case in March 2024A court in India has closed a corruption case against former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal almost two years after he was arrested and held in jailed for months.The Aam Admi Party (AAP) leader was arrested in March 2024, weeks before India's general election, in connection with a liquor policy which authorities alleged gave undue advantages to private retailers.On Friday, the court cleared Kejriwal and 23 others, saying there was \"no overarching conspiracy or criminal intent in the excise policy\".The judge also criticised the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for a shoddy probe and recommended an inquiry against its officials. The CBI said they would appeal against the verdict.Following Friday's order, Kejriwal broke down outside the court while talking to journalists as former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia hugged him.\"In the end, unrighteousness and injustice are defeated and truth alone prevails,\" Kejriwal said.Sisodia and AAP spokesperson Sanjay Singh were also arrested in the case in 2023 and are among the 23 cleared by the court. After their arrest, all three AAP leaders spent significant time in jail as they were repeatedly denied bail by the trial court and Delhi High Court before receiving relief from the Supreme Court.Kejriwal had accused the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which controls the police and investigating agencies in the capital, of plotting against him and targeting opposition leaders - allegations the BJP has denied.On Friday, the Rouse Avenue court in Delhi criticised the CBI for \"trying to construct  a narrative of conspiracy on the basis of mere conjecture\", legal news website Bar and Bench reported.The court also rebuked the CBI for building its case on statements made by approvers - accomplices who turn state's witnesses in exchange for a pardon or reduced sentences.\"If such conduct is allowed, it would be a grave violation of the Constitutional principles... A fair investigation is essential for a fair trial,\" the court said It added that it would recommend a departmental inquiry against CBI officials for their shoddy probe in the case.The liquor policy which led to the arrests of AAP leaders was introduced by the Kejriwal government in 2021, saying it would curb black market sales, increase revenues and ensure even distribution of liquor licences.It was withdrawn a few months later after Delhi's Lieutenant-Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena accused AAP of exploiting rules to benefit private liquor barons.A CBI case was registered in July 2022 on a complaint made by Saxena.",

    "body": "3 hours agoJaroslav LukivWatch: Crowds clash with police after Bolivian plane crashAt least 20 people have been killed and others injured after a Bolivian air force cargo plane crashed in the western city of El Alto, the country's authorities say.The incident happened at 18:15 local time (22:15 GMT) on Friday as the plane was arriving at El Alto's airport from the city of Santa Cruz, aviation officials said. It reportedly skidded off the runway and hit nearby vehicles.The defence ministry later confirmed its C-130 Hercules was involved and that it had been transporting banknotes to the Central Bank of Bolivia. There were eight people aboard the plane, the air force commander said.Police fired tear gas to disperse crowds allegedly trying to take the scattered banknotes.Firefighters had given an earlier death toll of at least 15.Video footage showed the plane on the ground and badly damaged vehicles. In other videos, people could be seen running away from the tear gas and police officers, some holding shields, forming a line. Some in the crowds are seen throwing rocks. \"While news crews were covering the accident, individuals attempting to steal the transported money attacked the press with unusual violence,\" the National Association of Journalists of Bolivia said in a statement. It said a mobile TV unit was \"directly targeted\", while other journalists \"were attacked with stones, suffering serious injuries while carrying out their work\". The government-run Bolivian News Agency reported that at least a dozen people were arrested for stealing banknotes.  ReutersBolivian banknotes were seen scattered at the crash site\"I want to make it clear to those who are trying to take money from the plane involved in this tragedy that this money has no legal value since it has not been issued by the Central Bank and does not have a serial number, and that attempting to use this money is a crime,\" the Minister of Defence, Marcelo Salinas, said. \"We also ask all those who are engaging in acts of vandalism in this area to refrain from doing so and to respect the mourning and grief we are experiencing at this difficult time.\"Bolivia's Air Force commander Sergio Lora confirmed there were eight crew members on board the plane \"including cargo personnel and flight crew\".Bolivia's health ministry said 31 people were injured in the incident. It also issued an urgent appeal for blood donations. El Alto International Airport was temporarily closed following the crash.\"My sister told me that she was in the car when the plane crashed. The plane's tire fell on the car, and my sister was injured because the impact of the tire hit her on the head, so we rushed her to the hospital,\" a man told the Reuters news agency.It was not immediately clear what caused the crash, but some witnesses said the  weather at the time was treacherous.\"A heavy hailstorm\" was falling and \"there was lightning\" when the plane went down,\" a woman whose car was struck by the aircraft wreckage told the AFP news agency.An investigation into the incident is under way.",

    "body": "DOJ charges 30 more people in Minnesota anti-ICE church protest14 hours agoSakshi VenkatramanUS reporterGetty ImagesThe US Department of Justice announced Friday that 30 more people are being charged for their roles in an anti-ICE protest staged last month at a church in Minnesota. Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on social media that 25 of the 30 defendants named in a newly unsealed indictment had been arrested by federal agents, with \"more to come\".The protest is the same one that led to the arrest of former CNN anchor Don Lemon, who along with nine others was charged after entering the Cities Church in St Paul with protesters who claimed a pastor was an immigration-enforcement official. Lemon and the others initially arrested have pleaded not guilty to civil rights violations. \"YOU CANNOT ATTACK A HOUSE OF WORSHIP. If you do so, you cannot hide from us — we will find you, arrest you, and prosecute you,\" Bondi wrote on social media Friday. \"This Department of Justice STANDS for Christians and all Americans of faith.\"All 39 people arrested are charged with conspiracy against religious freedom at a place of worship and injuring, intimidating and interfering with the exercise of the right of religious freedom at a place of worship.\"A group of approximately 40 agitators, including all of the defendants named in this Indictment, entered the Church in a coordinated takeover-style attack and engaged in acts of oppression, intimidation, threats, interference, and physical obstruction alleged herein,\" the indictment says. In the 18 January incident, protesters interrupted a service in the church by chanting \"ICE out\" and \"Justice for Renee Good\", the mother of three who was fatally shot by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer last month in Minneapolis. Footage showed a chaotic scene unfolding inside the church, which belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention, as protesters and members of the congregation shout at each other.Lemon was live-streaming the incident when it happened, and he has defended his decision to enter the church, saying he was simply carrying out his duty as an independent journalist covering a protest.\"I have spent my entire career covering the news. I will not stop now,\" he said soon after he was arrested.But the indictment alleges that Lemon and the other co-defendants \"entered the Church in a coordinated takeover-style attack and engaged in acts of oppression, intimidation, threats, interference, and physical obstruction\".Doug Wardlow, the lawyer representing Cities Church, celebrated the news of additional arrests, saying it \"sends a clear message: houses of worship are off limits for those who would use chaos and intimidation to advance a political agenda\".In the statement posted to social media, Wardlow said the protest \"placed congregants, including children, in fear for their lives\".Three weeks after Good's death and a week after the church protest, federal agents fatally shot a second person, intensive care nurse Alex Pretti. Both Pretti and Good were killed as they were protesting against the Trump administration's immigration-enforcement efforts in Minnesota, an operation that has since ended.",

    "body": "21 hours agoRobert GreenallBBC NewsWatch: Emergency services at the scene of tram derailment in central MilanAt least two people have been killed and up to 40 others are reported to have been injured, after a tram derailed in the northern Italian city of Milan.The crowded tram was travelling on the line 9 route along Milan's Viale Vittorio Veneto at about 16:00 local time (15:00 GMT) when it left the track and crashed into a building.One of the people who died, a 60-year-old man, is thought to have been a pedestrian hit by the tram, while the other fatality and most of the injured were passengers. Numerous ambulances went to the scene as reports emerged of people trapped in the wreckage.ReutersThe tram crashed into the side of a building after it derailedPassengers described hearing a noise underneath the tram, after which it veered off its track, gathered speed and went into the side of a building.\"I thought it was an earthquake. I was sitting down and I fell on the floor, along with the other passengers,\" one man told Ansa news agency. \"It was terrible.\"As it left the track, the tram apparently first hit a traffic light before smashing the window of a restaurant. A delivery rider waiting at the traffic light and a young man on a pavement narrowly escaped injury, La Repubblica website reported.\"I got on at the first stop, [Piazza della] Repubblica,\" one female passenger told Corriere della Sera. \"I was standing next to the driver, and they all crashed into me.\"\"I just heard an enormous bang,\" said 27-year-old Anna, who was in an office nearby, quoted by AFP. \"I saw a bit of the tram had gone into a shop.\"Civil protection teams set up a tent at the scene to help the injured.It is not clear what caused the derailment, although media reports suggested the tram had taken a sharp corner too quickly, as it turned out of Viale Vittorio Veneto.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed her \"deepest condolences\" over the deaths.Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala and other city officials visited the scene of the crash.Sala said the incident was a \"tragedy\" and that there would be investigations. The driver was \"very experienced\", he said, adding that he had only been on duty for an hour and was not working overtime.\"The thing that is a little strange, you see, is that there is a stop here that was skipped, and so that adds another element to what happened,\" Sala said, quoted by Reuters.  He added that the possibility the driver had suddenly been taken ill was being considered.ReutersEmergency workers have been tending to victims at the site of the crashTransport company ATM said in a statement it was \"deeply shaken\" by the incident, and said its thoughts were with the victims and their families.The incident comes at a time when the city is packed with international visitors, celebrities and journalists for Milan Fashion Week. It has also just finished hosting the Winter Olympics and is preparing to host the Paralympics.The three-car tram is one of a new bidirectional type with drivers' cabs at either end, introduced in the city only a few weeks ago, according to Corriere della Sera.",

    "body": "Inside Iran, panic as strikes hit but for some it's a moment of relief41 minutes agoRobert GreenallBBC NewsGetty ImagesMany residents have begun heading north from TehranVideos circulating on social media show people near the blast sites running in panic, with the sounds of screams and crying in the background.But, says BBC Persian, at the same time there appears to be a sense of relief - even celebration - among those who believe the regime's downfall can only come through military intervention.In one video, a woman speaks with unmistakable relief, saying Ayatollah Khamenei's residence has been hit. Another clip shows teenagers at a school dancing and chanting that the strikes have happened, adding, \"I love Trump.\"Many people had been anticipating a possible US attack. Since Friday night, long queues have formed at petrol stations, and many residents of the capital, Tehran, have begun leaving the city for the north, near the Caspian Sea, which they believe is safer.With Iran coming under an almost total internet blackout since the attacks started, it has been difficult to contact anyone inside the country. Some people briefly managed to access the internet using methods such as SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet and virtual private networks, and may be able to do so again.Getty ImagesPeople in Iran are trying to find out news of the attacks amid an internet blackoutThe BBC has, however, been able to reach a number of pro-regime figures who spoke about the situation in Tehran.\"We have heard lots of explosions. I live in middle of Tehran,\" one of them told BBC Newshour. \"This was a normal day until the United States and Israel started attacking the city. Our children have gone to a school in the morning. We had to go and get the children.\"Another told the BBC Weekend programme he heard fighter jets and two explosions early in the morning from his office in the north of the city. The atmosphere was tense and there was a sense of war in the air.He said that people were shopping and stocking up on canned food.One resident told BBC Persian via Starlink there was a heavy security presence on streets leading to the compound of the Leadership House, the office of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei.'Look after our children'Before the blackout, some people posted messages on social media in case they were killed in air strikes.\"If I die, don't forget that we exist too - those of us who oppose any military attack, those of us who will become just a number in reports of the dead,\" one Iranian wrote on social media.Another wrote: \"Damn the Islamic dictatorship that caused this war. We have already endured three wars.\"Some posts highlight the strain of communication and fear for children caught in the conflict: \"The internet is almost down... If the network is completely cut, know that we are not soldiers for any leader, nor collateral damage,\" said another user. \"We are human and have the right to live. Try to make our future democratic, not dependent on individuals.\"Another user wrote: \"Promise that if anything happens to us, you will look after our children and be very, very kind to them. Tell them we did everything we could - we joined silent marches, we voted, we worked multiple shifts, we endured great hardship.\"Others, however, fear that air strikes alone may not bring about the regime's collapse. They worry it could survive and, in response, become even more brutal towards its own people.At the time of protests more than a month ago in which thousands were killed, US President Donald Trump had encouraged Iranians to continue protesting, vowing that help was on the way. Now, some Iranians report receiving text messages reading, \"Help has come\" - urging people to stay at home and calling on regime forces to lay down their arms.But public sentiment could shift sharply if civilians are killed in the strikes, with many Iranians reacting with anger after state media reported that an Israeli strike on a girls' school killed dozens of people. There is no confirmation.An Iranian living abroad who opposes military intervention in Iran commented: \"The first victims of this war are 40 girls in Minab, hit by a missile attack. Is this the war you cheer for?\"Deep mistrust of the Iranian regime, however, makes official reports difficult for many to accept, and some Iranians directly blamed the regime for the attack.One user wrote: \"Even if the regime did not directly target schools, the deaths of children in Minab remain the responsibility of the Islamic Republic. \"People have no shelters, the internet is cut, phone lines are down, and there has been no warning to keep children out of school. In these conditions, the minimum requirement should be to stay at home.\"",

    "body": "19 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporterAFP via Getty ImagesCanadian officials have criticised OpenAI for failing to report the suspect's ChatGPT account to police, and say they believe the shooting could have been preventedOpenAI says it will strengthen its safety measures after the company failed to alert police about the Tumbler Ridge shooting suspect's ChatGPT account despite it being flagged internally months before the attack.In an open letter to Canadian officials, the company said the suspect was able to create a second account after the first was banned, slipping past its internal detection systems.Canada's AI minister said on Friday that he will meet OpenAI CEO Sam Altman next week \"to seek further clarity\" on the safety commitments made by the tech firm. An account linked to the suspect, 18‑year‑old Jesse Van Rootselaar, was banned by OpenAI in June 2025 — seven months before the shooting.Eight people were killed in the 10 February attack, which took place at a residence and the local secondary school in Tumbler Ridge, a small town in British Columbia, Canada. The victims included the suspect's mother and 11‑year‑old stepbrother, as well as five young school children and an educator. Van Rootselaar died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said. The shooting was one of the deadliest in Canadian history. Canada summons OpenAI senior staff over Tumbler Ridge shootingWho were the victims of the shootings in Tumbler Ridge, Canada?Canadian officials met OpenAI senior staff earlier this week in Ottawa, after the company revealed it had shut down a ChatGPT account used by the suspect in June 2025 for violating usage terms.That account was not reported to police, however, because it did not at the time meet its threshold for \"credible and imminent planning\" of serious violence, the company said.In its letter to Canadian officials on Thursday, penned by OpenAI's vice-president of global policy and shared with media outlets, the company said it had implemented a series of changes in recent months, including enlisting the help of \"mental health and behavioural experts\" to assess cases and making the criteria for referral to police \"more flexible\". Because of the changes, OpenAI said it would have reported the suspect's ChatGPT account under the new guidelines.The letter does not specify when those new protocols took effect.The company also revealed that the suspect was able to create a second account, despite being flagged by OpenAI systems in the past. That second account was shared with police after the shooting, it said.\"We commit to strengthening our detection systems to better prevent attempts to evade our safeguards and prioritize identifying the highest risk offenders,\" the company wrote.OpenAI said it will also establish a direct point of contact with Canadian law enforcement so it can quickly flag any possible future cases with \"potential for real world violence\". That direct line of communication is one of the requests made by Canadian officials following their meeting with OpenAI staff on Tuesday.Canada's AI minister Evan Solomon said on Friday that while legislators saw a willingness by the tech firm to improve its protocols, \"we have not yet seen a detailed plan for how these commitments will be implemented in practice\".\"Canadians deserve greater clarity about how human review decisions are made, how escalation thresholds are applied, and how privacy considerations are balanced with public safety,\" he said in a statement. Solomon also opened the door for future legislation on the matter if OpenAI fails to implement changes quickly. He will meet Altman next week. British Columbia Premier David Eby has said he believes the shooting would have been prevented if the company had alerted police to Van Rootselaar's account months ago.\"They tragically missed the mark in [not] bringing this information forward. The consequences of that will be borne by the families of Tumbler Ridge for the rest of their lives,\" Eby told reporters on Thursday.Eby added that OpenAI Sam Altman has agreed to meet to discuss the company's safety policies. \"I think it's important that Mr Altman hear about how his team's decision not to bring this information forward has resulted in devastation,\" he said.",

    "body": "Iran says it has hit US base in Bahrain, as it launches strikes across region3 hours agoTom BennettReutersPlumes of black smoke were seen rising above an area near the headquarters of the US Navy's Fifth FleetIranian forces say they have struck a US naval base in Bahrain, as Iran launched strikes across the region in retaliation for a \"massive\" and ongoing attack against it by the US and Israel.Huge plumes of black smoke were seen rising from an area near the headquarters of the US Navy's Fifth Fleet in Manama, Bahrain. The extent of any damage is unclear and the US has not commented. Elsewhere across the region, the UAE, Qatar, Jordan and Kuwait - all home to US military bases - said they have intercepted missiles fired towards them.  In Doha, Qatar's defence ministry said it had intercepted several missiles apparently targeting the al-Udeid air base, the largest US base in the region.The US has about 13 military bases across the Middle East, with 30,000 to 40,000 troops normally deployed between them. Authorities in Bahrain confirmed the attack on the US naval base, known officially as Naval Support Activity Bahrain. It is the home port for ships including anti-mine vessels and logistical support ships, though it is unclear if any were present. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said in a statement it was targeting US bases and assets as part of operation \"Truthful Promise 4\", in retaliation for the attack on Iran launched by the US and Israel on Saturday morning. That attack - launched at approximately 09:30 Tehran time (06:00 GMT) - has so far targeted areas linked to the Iranian leadership, with US President Donald Trump encouraging the Iranian people to rise up against the regime. In Israel, sirens have been activated across the country throughout Saturday - with its military saying numerous rounds of missiles had been launched at it by Iran, and that its air force is working to intercept them. In neighbouring Jordan, the armed forces said they had shot down two ballistic missiles targeting its territory, with authorities saying there were no casualties. The defence ministry of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) said in a statement that the country has been subjected to a \"a blatant attack involving Iranian ballistic missiles\".\"UAE air defence systems dealt with the missiles with high efficiency and successfully intercepted a number of missiles,\" it added. It said debris fell on a residential area in Abu Dhabi, causing some material damage and killing a civilian. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi condemned the attack by the US and Israel as \"wholly unprovoked, illegal, and illegitimate\", and said Iran's armed forces \"are prepared for this day and will teach the aggressors the lesson they deserve\".",

    "body": "1 day agoHafsa KhalilAFP via Getty ImagesA tank was pictured situated near the border in Chaman, Pakistan on Friday.Pakistan's defence minister has said the country is in \"open war\" with Afghanistan, after Islamabad launched airstrikes on Kabul as part of a wave of attacks across the country.\"Our patience has now run out,\" said Khawaja Muhammad Asif following the attacks.The strikes came after the Afghan Taliban announced a major offensive against Pakistani military posts near the border on Thursday night.The latest attacks follow months of clashes between the two neighbouring nations, despite agreeing to a fragile ceasefire in October.Last year's negotiations failed to reach a broader agreement for a complete end to hostilities, with both side blaming each other for not engaging seriously with talks.The Taliban said a \"retaliatory operation\" had been launched at around 20:00 local time (15:30 GMT) on Thursday.It said it had captured 19 Pakistani military posts and two bases, adding that 55 Pakistani soldiers had been killed. The BBC has not been able to verify these claims.Pakistan quickly retaliated, saying the Taliban had \"miscalculated and opened unprovoked fire on multiple locations\" across the border in its north-western province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which had been met with an \"immediate and effective response\" by Islamabad's security forces.It then launched a series of bombing raids on Afghanistan in the early hours of Friday morning, striking targets in Kabul, Kandahar and Paktika in response to what they called \"unprovoked Afghan attacks\".All three cities are close to the shared Pakistani-Afghan mountainous border that spans 2,600 km (1,615 miles).Pakistan's military spokesman Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said it had hit 22 Afghan military targets and killed more that 200 Taliban fighters. At least 12 Pakistani soldiers had died, he added.But the Taliban's spokesman Mujahid said just 13 Taliban fighters had been killed and 22 others injured, while 13 civilians had been injured and an indeterminate number killed.The BBC has not been able to verify these numbers. During these hostilities, both sides have claimed to have inflicted heavy losses on the other while suffering little damage to their own.In response to the strikes, Zabihullah Mujahid, the Afghan Taliban spokesman, published - then subsequently deleted - a post on X that the group had launched strikes early on Friday on Pakistani military positions in Kandahar and Helmand, two provinces in Afghanistan.The Afghan Taliban has said it carried out air strikes on several targets within Pakistan, on Friday morning. Sources in the Taliban government told the BBC these were with drones launched from Afghanistan.Pakistan's Information Minister Atta Tarar said its military thwarted Afghan drones targeting Swabi, Nowshera and Abbottabad, which is a military garrison city housing the army's military academy.Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said his country's forces had \"the full capability to crush any aggressive ambitions\", vowing that there would be \"no compromise\" in defending their \"beloved homeland\".In Afghanistan, Taliban officials on Friday claimed Pakistani rockets hit a refugee camp in Nangarhar - housing Afghan citizens recently arrived from Pakistan - and injured at least nine people. The BBC has not been able to verify this.Residents and local officials in the Afghan cities hit told BBC Afghan the situation appeared to have calmed down since the attacks, although people on both sides of the border remained on high alert.Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has spoken to his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan, the ministry said, and \"agreed to stay closely engaged on evolving developments\" as they both stressed the \"importance of peace and stability\".Dar, who is in Saudi Arabia for an official visit, also held a similar conversation with the country's Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud.Meanwhile, Iran has offered to \"facilitate dialogue\" between Pakistan and Afghanistan as it urged them to \"resolve their differences through good neighbourliness and dialogue\".UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper also urged the two sides to re-engage in talks, take \"immediate steps toward de‑escalation [and] avoid further harm to civilians\".While a fragile ceasefire between the two countries was agreed in October, negotiations failed to reach a broader agreement for a complete end to hostilities, with both side blaming the other for not engaging seriously with talks.Pakistan has long accused Afghanistan's Taliban government of supporting \"anti-Pakistan terrorists\", who it blames for carrying out suicide attacks in the country, including at a mosque in the capital recently.",

    "body": "20 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorTT/ReutersSweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson joined French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot on board the Charles de Gaulle on FridayA drone jammed by the Swedish military after it was spotted near a French aircraft carrier docked in Malmo has been confirmed to be Russian, Sweden's armed forces say.The French military said the drone was spotted seven nautical miles (13km) from the Charles de Gaulle carrier, which has never visited Sweden before and is due to take part in Nato exercises in the region.In a statement, the Swedish Armed Forces said the drone was seen taking off from a nearby Russian spy ship, the Zhigulevsk.\"The incident occurred in connection with Charles de Gaulle's visit to Malmö, and the Navy acted swiftly to jam the drone,\" it added.A Kremlin spokesman previously rejected the Swedish claims as \"absurd\".Nato allies have for months reported drone sightings close to military sites and airports, including a number of incidents in Denmark and the Baltic states. An investigation was launched in December after drones flew over the Île Longue naval base, which is home to France's nuclear ballistic submarines off the Breton town of Brest.Earlier, Swedish Defence Minister Pal Jonson told public broadcaster SVT there was probably a \"strong link\" between the drone and a Russian naval vessel in Sweden's territorial waters in the Oresund Strait, between Sweden and Denmark.It is not clear what happened to the drone after it had been jammed but Jonson said the Russian ship had sailed on to the Baltic Sea.Speaking on board the carrier earlier, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said the incident was serious but not unexpected. It was very difficult to see as a coincidence, he said, adding that \"it is a Russian way of acting that we recognise from other places\".French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot, who was with Kristersson on board the aircraft carrier on Friday, praised Stockholm's handling of the incident.\"If indeed... there is a potential Russian origin for this incident, the only conclusion I would draw is that it would be a ridiculous provocation,\" he told reporters.Both armed forces have played down the drone incident, and French General Staff spokesman Col Guillaume Vernet said it had demonstrated the \"robustness\" of the Swedish response, adding that it had no impact on the French mission.AFP via Getty ImagesThe Charles de Gaulle, equipped with Rafale fighter jets, has never docked in Sweden beforeA French ex-military commander at the UN, Gen Dominique Trinquand, said if it was a Russian drone off Malmo then it was not surprising that Moscow was conducting intelligence operations in the area. \"That they would do so while the French aircraft carrier is deployed there is certainly a strategic signal,\" he told French media.The Charles de Gaulle has its own naval escort and carries Rafale fighter jets and reconnaissance planes on board, but relies on a host nation for defence while in its territorial waters.The carrier strike group's arrival in Sweden signals a change in France's military focus towards its Nato allies in Northern Europe. Under a mission called La Fayette 26, the Charles de Gaulle will take part in several long-planned Nato exercises in the Baltic and in the Atlantic, off the coast of Norway. Its mission is being seen as a response to Moscow after a lengthy period of Russian hybrid warfare.Meanwhile, Sweden's coast guard has opened an investigation into a fuel spill in the port of Malmo, where two oil tankers are docked, as well as the Charles de Gaulle.The oil spill was detected on Thursday and although the cause is not yet known, the port has told Swedish media it is not linked to the aircraft carrier.",

    "body": "Trump orders government to stop using Anthropic in battle over AI use12 hours agoKali Hays,technology reporterandLily Jamali,North America technology correspondentReutersUS President Donald Trump has said he would direct every federal agency to immediately stop using technology from AI developer Anthropic.\"We don't need it, we don't want it, and will not do business with them again!\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Friday.Anthropic is mired in a row with the White House after refusing demands that it agree to give the US military unfettered access to its AI tools. The refusal led US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth to say he's deemed Anthropic a \"supply chain risk\".The label would make Anthropic the first US company to ever publicly receive such treatment. The company said that it \"will challenge any supply chain risk designation in court\".Trump's directive came after days of back and forth, in public and private, between the company's CEO Dario Amodei and Hegseth.The company had grown concerned in recent months about the government potentially using its AI tools, like Claude, in what it described as \"mass surveillance\" and \"fully autonomous weapons\". Hegseth and the Pentagon have insisted that Anthropic agree to \"any lawful use\" of its tools and technology.Both Trump and Hegseth announced their decisions against Anthropic on social media, with the defence secretary saying on X that Anthropic would be \"immediately\" designated a supply chain risk, prohibiting any business working with the military from \"any commercial activity with Anthropic\".Anthropic said on Friday evening that it had yet to hear anything directly from the White House or the military \"on the status of our negotiations\". Nevertheless, the company said being designated a supply chain risk \"would both be legally unsound and set a dangerous precedent for any American company that negotiates with the government\".\"No amount of intimidation or punishment from the Department of War will change our position on mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons\", the company added.The Department of War is a secondary name Trump has given to the defence department.Anthropic's tools will be phased out of all government work over the next six months, Trump said.As for Anthropic's other customers, the company said the only impact will be on companies that also contract with the military. Those companies may have to stop using Anthropic for work being done on behalf of the department.Prior to Trump's pronouncement, Anthropic had said that, if the US Department of Defense chose to stop using the company's tools, the company would \"work to enable a smooth transition to another provider\".Yet, Trump berated the company on his Truth Social platform, saying Anthropic \"better get their act together, and be helpful during this phase out period, or I will use the Full Power of the Presidency to make them comply, with major civil and criminal consequences to follow\".Anthropic has been in use by the US government and military since 2024 and was the first advanced AI company to have its tools deployed in government agencies doing classified work.  Prior to Trump's decision on Friday, Anthropic received support in its stance against the government.OpenAI boss Sam Altman offered support to rival AI executive Amodei. He sent a note to staff stating that he had the same \"red lines\" when it came to the application of the firms' products.In the note seen by the BBC, Altman said any OpenAI contracts for the military would also reject uses that were \"unlawful or unsuited to cloud deployments, such as domestic surveillance and autonomous offensive weapons\".He later confirmed on X that OpenAI had reached a deal with the Department of War to use its AI models on classified cloud networks. Amodei is a long-time figure in tech, rising to prominence as an early employee of OpenAI. He and a handful of other OpenAI employees left the company to found Anthropic after disagreements with Altman.The two startups now compete directly for users and corporate customers with an evolving offer of AI chatbots, agents and other tools.\"I do not fully understand how things got here; I do not know why Anthropic did their deal with the Pentagon and Palantir in the way they originally did it,\" Altman wrote in his company memo.\"But regardless of how we got here, this is no longer just an issue between Anthropic and the [Department of War] DoW; this is an issue for the whole industry and it is important to clarify our stance.\"Hegseth on Tuesday called Amodei to Washington DC for a meeting amid growing tensions. It culminated in two contradictory ultimatums if Anthropic refused to grant the department free rein of its tools.  Hegseth said he would invoke the Defense Production Act, allowing the government to use Anthropic's products as it saw fit, and deem it a \"supply chain risk\".By Thursday, Amodei said he would rather stop working with the Pentagon than acquiesce to such threats. A former official with the DoD, who asked not to be named, told the BBC that Anthropic appeared to have the upper hand in the fight.\"This is great PR for them and they simply do not need the money,\" the former official said.Anthropic's work with the Pentagon is part of a contract worth $200m (£149m). The company's most recent valuation came earlier this month and put the company's worth at $380 billion, based on its current revenue and future expected earnings.The former official added that the defence department's basis for threatening Anthropic with invoking either the Defense Production Act and being labelled a supply chain risk was \"extremely flimsy\".",

    "body": "1 day agoDanielle Kaye,Business reporterandNardine Saad,Los Angeles, California Getty ImagesNetflix has backed away from its proposal to buy Warner Bros Discovery, clearing the way for Paramount Skydance to win a months-long battle for one of Hollywood's most storied studios in a deal worth around $111bn (£82.2bn).Warner Bros, which put itself up for sale last year, on Thursday said Paramount's latest bid was \"superior\" to the one from Netflix, which in turn refused to raise its offer.Netflix executives say they have declined to match Paramount's bid as \"the deal is no longer financially attractive\" at that price.The buyer would gain control of the iconic studio along with its films and media networks - a takeover that could significantly reshape the media landscape.Last December, Warner Bros agreed to a takeover offer from Netflix for some of its assets, in a deal worth roughly $82bn (£61bn) including debt.Paramount then made a rival proposal, which was rebuffed by Warner Bros, but an increased offer was made earlier this week, boosted by $1 per share.\"The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,\" Netflix co-chief executives Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a statement. \"However, we've always been disciplined.\"\"This transaction was always a 'nice to have' at the right price, not a 'must have' at any price,\" the Netflix executives added.The announcement came just hours after Sarandos had visited the White House on Thursday.It caps off a dramatic months-long saga that - if approved by regulators - is likely to reshape Hollywood.But California Attorney General Rob Bonta said later on Thursday that the potential merger \"is not a done deal\".\"These two Hollywood titans have not cleared regulatory scrutiny - the California Department of Justice has an open investigation, and we intend to be vigorous in our review,\" he wrote in a social media post.Bonta had said earlier this month that his office would review any deal involving Warner Bros as the entertainment industry represents a \"critical sector\" for California's economy.Paramount would also need approval from the US Department of Justice as well as European regulators.A deal between Paramount and Warner Bros could hold serious ramifications for the future of one of the US's biggest news brands - CNN. Warner Bros is the network's parent company.Paramount, which is looking to transform itself into a Hollywood heavyweight, is backed by tech billionaire Larry Ellison and led by his son David.The funding of Paramount's offer has drawn scrutiny, in part over the close ties between US President Donald Trump and Larry Ellison, a major Republican donor.Trump has frequently attacked the news network over its reporting of his policies. He said in December that he believed CNN should be sold as part of any Warner Bros deal. He called the people running CNN \"corrupt or incompetent\" and said they should not be entrusted to run the network.CNN head Mark Thompson sent an email to employees as news spread of the all-but-assured Paramount deal, telling workers to not \"jump to conclusions about the future until we know more\", US media reported. The BBC has contacted CNN for comment.Paramount's initial hostile bid was also supported by Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner through his investment firm, raising concerns about the president's influence over the deal.Kushner's firm, Affinity Partners, backed away in December amid scrutiny over the deal.Paramount's 2025 merger with Skydance also led to scrutiny amid negotiations with the Trump administration's Federal Communications Commission, which had to sign off on the deal.Among the concessions made was Paramount's $16m settlement on behalf of CBS News. Trump had sued the network over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with former vice president Kamala Harris, claiming that the network had engaged in election interference in the way the program was edited.The two studio's merger later resulted in leadership shakeups and layoffs at CBS News.On Thursday, chief executive David Ellison welcomed the Warner Bros board's decision in favour of Paramount's sweetened offer. The proposal, he said in a statement, offers Warner Bros shareholders \"superior value, certainty and speed to closing\".If Paramount's deal is approved by regulators, the company would fold Warner Bros' HBO Max streaming customers into its portfolio. It would also take ownership of CNN, the Food Network and a range of sports offerings.Paramount's traditional networks already include brands such as Nickelodeon, CBS and Comedy Central.Getty ImagesParamount Skydance boss David EllisonMany in Hollywood have viewed the bidding war between Netflix and Paramount as a battle with no good winner.Critics of a deal with Netflix voiced concern that the storied movie studio would be lost to the Silicon Valley streaming titan, paving the way for the depletion of cinema. But a merger with Paramount, which has touted itself among the last standing movie studios in Hollywood, also left critics unnerved over the company's perceived political connections to the Trump administration - a concern that has also riled the media landscape over the future of CNN. Across the board, the selling of Warner Bros will have massive ramification across Tinsel town, with all but assured cuts to staff in a city that has been marred by continued production cuts.In December, Warner Bros said it had agreed to sell its film and streaming divisions, including HBO, to Netflix in a deal worth $27.75 per share or roughly $82bn (£61bn), including debt.Warner Bros said it would spin-off the remainder of its business, including traditional television networks and the news channel CNN, as an independent company.But in a last-ditch push, Paramount this week agreed to pay more for a Warner Bros takeover. The company offered $31 per share in cash, up from $30 per share to take over the entire company.It also agreed to pay $7bn should the deal fall through and cover the $2.8bn fee Warner Bros had agreed to pay Netflix in the event of a break-up of the merger plan.Additional reporting by Osmond Chia",

    "body": "1 day agoEmir NaderandSamuel Owers,BBC Eye Investigations US Department of JusticeBin Ennakhil, located in the luxury Palmeraie neighbourhood of Marrakech, has been described as an architectural masterpieceJeffrey Epstein tried to buy a multimillion-dollar palace in Morocco the day before his arrest in 2019, according to documents released by the US Department of Justice last month.Epstein had pursued acquiring Bin Ennakhil since 2011, but disputes with the seller over the price and purchase arrangement dragged on for years.The grand palace in the luxury Palmeraie neighbourhood of Marrakech has been described as an architectural masterpiece, built by 1,300 craftsmen and featuring ornate carvings and mosaics.Epstein signed a $14.95m (£11m) wire transfer on 5 July 2019, the day before his arrest, following an agreement to buy the offshore company that owned the property for €18m (£13.3m).ReutersEpstein had pursued acquiring Bin Ennakhil since 2011, but disputes over the price and purchase arrangement dragged on for yearsHe signed a $14.95m wire transfer for the property on 5 July 2019, the day before his arrest According to the released documents, the transfer was Epstein's last major financial transaction in the period before his arrest by US authorities on sex trafficking charges upon his return to New York. Three days after the arrest, Epstein's accountant Richard Kahn cancelled the wire transfer and the purchase was ultimately never completed. Morocco has no extradition treaty with the US and local media has speculated that one of Epstein's motivations to purchase the property may have been to retreat to the country to avoid arrest, if new charges were brought against him.However, a former associate of Epstein, who preferred not to be named, said the transaction showed Epstein \"had no clue\" about his imminent arrest.They added that \"it would make sense if he was thinking of a potential sanctuary where he could still live like a king\". The released files, however, contain no reference to Epstein discussing the country as a possible refuge from US authorities.US Department of JusticeIt took 1,300 craftsmen three years to build the palace, according to a property brochure Epstein's connections to Morocco go back to at least the early 2000s, with Virginia Giuffre, one of his most prominent accusers, recounting in her memoir of being flown to Tangier by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell to inspect the interior design of a number of luxury properties. At the time, Epstein wanted to redesign parts of his island home in a Moroccan style. In 2002, Epstein attended the wedding of Moroccan King Mohammed with Maxwell, having been invited by former US President Bill Clinton. Epstein's connections Epstein was convicted in the United States of soliciting underage sex in 2008, and following his release from house arrest in 2010 his interest in Morocco seems to have grown. The released files appear to show that in the same year, Epstein asked former Labour cabinet minister Peter Mandelson to find him an assistant who could \"fin[d] a house in Marrakesh\" for him.PAIn 2010 Epstein appeared to ask Peter Mandelson - pictured here following his arrest earlier this week - to find him an assistant who could \"fin[d] a house in Marrakesh\" for himThe documents detail how Epstein made periodic visits to Morocco from 2012, staying in the exclusive Palmeraie district, home to a wealthy community of expatriates including Jabor al Thani of the Qatari royal family, a close associate whom he described as his \"Arab brother\".Being mentioned or pictured in the Epstein files is not, in itself, an indication of wrongdoing.Bin Ennakhil and 'Mr Kiss'Epstein's long-term girlfriend Karyna Shuliak began leading the search for a property in Marrakech, with numerous visits and negotiations documented in emails under her name.Marc Leon, a partner of Kensington Luxury Properties, told the BBC that Epstein's focus settled on their property Bin Ennakhil  - Arabic for \"between the palm trees\" - as early as 2011.At that time, Epstein thought the palace, owned by German waste magnate Gunter Kiss, was overvalued at €55m and his initial offer was so low that Kiss was offended and refused to deal with Epstein again, the source who was close to Epstein told the BBC.Subsequently, Epstein used his girlfriend Shuliak and his network of contacts in Morocco to conduct further inspections of the property. In 2018, Epstein himself visited the property before Shuliak made final bids on the property while pretending to be acting on behalf of Leon Black, a billionaire investor friend of Epstein.Ultimately, it became clear that Epstein was the real prospective buyer but the seller \"Mr Kiss\" - as he is known in the emails - agreed to continue the negotiations, according to the documents and the source close to Epstein.Inside the Moroccan palace that caught Epstein's eye: US Department of JusticeUS Department of JusticeThe palace features ornate carvings and mosaics A space to entertain The files show that, at one stage, Kensington Luxury Properties proposed to Epstein a \"sale and tax strategy\", whereby the property would be registered with the Moroccan authorities as sold for €10m while a transaction of €20m would take place for the shares of an offshore company that owned the property.The arrangement would have allowed Epstein to register his name on the title deeds of the property while reducing the tax he would pay to Moroccan authorities.However, Kensington Luxury Properties denied to the BBC that there was an unethical or illegal attempt to minimise tax.\"This transaction did not violate any tax regulations,\" Mr Leon told the BBC. \"Mr Epstein wanted to pay registration fees in Morocco, even though he was under no obligation to do so… in order to own the property in his own name.\"The property company was at the time the local real estate representative of the renowned UK-based auction house Christie's.Ultimately, Epstein decided to purchase the property solely by paying for the shares of the offshore company and was in the process of determining how to register it in Morocco at the time of his 2019 arrest.",

    "body": "1 day agoYogita LimayeSouth Asia and Afghanistan correspondentWatch: Pakistan releases footage it claims shows strikes on KabulResidents of Kabul's District 6 were awakened abruptly on Thursday night by the sound of an explosion that shook their homes. They rushed out in the street and heard jets flying overhead.It was a night that saw a serious escalation in violence between Afghanistan and Pakistan, with Pakistan launching airstrikes in Afghanistan - including its capital city, Kabul. Other places struck were in Paktia and Kandahar provinces, the latter a stronghold and the birthplace of the Taliban movement.Hostilities between the two sides have been ongoing for months, yet the answer to who started the aggression depends on who you ask.Earlier in the night, Afghanistan's Taliban government said it had launched a major ground operation against Pakistani military positions near the border, claiming to have captured several posts, and also claiming to have captured and killed Pakistani soldiers. The Taliban government says they were \"retaliatory operations\" - a response after \"Pakistani military elements carried out an incursion into Afghan territory, violated Afghan sovereignty, and caused the deaths of several civilians, including women and children\".They were referring to an earlier round of Pakistani airstrikes carried out less than a week ago - on the night of 21 February - targeting the eastern Nangarhar and Paktika provinces. The United Nations has said it has credible reports that 13 Afghan civilians were killed in those strikes.AFP via Getty ImagesThis latest escalation comes days after Pakistan carried out air strikes inside Afghanistan following suicide blasts on its soil (file photo)Islamabad has a different view. It says its airstrikes have not targeted civilians but instead have targeted militant hideouts in Afghanistan, specifically those of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) or the Pakistani Taliban, which Pakistan's government refers to as Fitna al Khawarij.Pakistan also alleges the attacks are being carried out at the behest of the TTP's Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers, who are being supported by the Taliban government.The Taliban government repeatedly maintains that its territory is not being used to threaten the security of any country, and that Pakistan's actions in Afghanistan are \"unprovoked\".Qatar and Turkey mediated between the two sides, with talks held in Doha and Istanbul. A fragile ceasefire followed, but the negotiations failed to bring about a ceasing of hostilities between the two sides.Both countries blamed the other for not engaging seriously in diplomacy.Militarily, Pakistan has the upper hand by a long mile. It is a significant military power with hundreds of tanks and aircraft, and advanced defence technology.ReutersThe Taliban do not have the upper hand militarily, but are experienced in guerrilla and unconventional warfare Afghanistan's Taliban government has military equipment left behind by the former Afghan and foreign forces. And despite sanctions, reports suggest it has been able to purchase some military equipment through the black market.So far, there's no evidence that it has the planes or the capability to launch airstrikes deep into Pakistan.But as a group, the Taliban sustained more than 20 years of war against the US and its Nato allies, so its capacity to carry out unconventional and guerrilla warfare is well evidenced.And in the latest stand-off, the Taliban government used drones to strike targets in Pakistan. Drones, which are cheap, small and easy to use, will undoubtedly alter the nature of this conflict like they have changed battlefields around the world.The difficulty with assessing how far the latest escalation might go, stems in part from the lack of verified information available from either side.The Taliban government does not allow easy access to foreign journalists, and verifying information, particularly from border areas, is even more challenging.In Pakistan too, gathering verified information from border areas independently is not easy.Trade between the two countries has been closed since October 2025, the longest in decades which is affecting small businesses in Afghanistan, and the availability of supplies, including crucial medicines.For ordinary Afghans, reeling under a severe crisis of hunger and poverty, and living under the Taliban government's stringent restrictions, the one positive since 2021 was that after four decades of war, they didn't have to worry about bombs falling on them and their families.That feeling of relative security has now been punctured by the violence of the past six months.Additional reporting by Usman Zahid and Mahfouz Zubaide",

    "body": "Flights returning to normal after Airbus warning grounded planes24 hours agoHafsa KhalilGetty ImagesThousands of Airbus planes are returning to normal service after being briefly grounded following a warning that solar radiation could interfere with onboard computers.The aerospace giant - based in France - said about 6,000 of its A320 planes had been affected, with most requiring a quick software update. Some 900 older planes need a replacement computer.On Saturday, French Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot said the updates \"went very smoothly\" for more than 5,000 planes, and fewer than 100 still needed the update.Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury apologised for what he called \"logistical challenges and delays\".He said teams were working to ensure that updates are completed \"as swiftly as possible\".On Saturday morning, several Air France flights in and out of Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport were delayed or cancelled.American Airlines said it expected \"operational delays\" but added that the vast majority of updates would be carried out by Saturday. Delta Airlines said it believed the impact on its operations would be limited.The UK Civil Aviation Authority said that airlines operating in the country worked through the night to carry out the update and air traffic had not been seriously affected.London's Gatwick Airport reported \"some disruption\", while Heathrow said it had not experienced any cancellations.Manchester Airport said it did not anticipate significant problems, and Luton Airport reported that there was \"no expected impact\".British Airways and Air India are understood not to be heavily impacted by the issue.On Saturday, Easyjet said it had completed the update on a \"significant number\" of its aircraft, and planned to operate as normal.Wizz Air is also running as normal, having rolled out updates overnight.In Australia, budget airline Jetstar cancelled 90 flights. Most of its aircraft have now undergone the update, but some disruptions are expected though the weekend.Air New Zealand grounded its A320 planes, but all fights have now resumed after the update was completed.Airbus discovered the issue after a JetBlue Airways plane flying between the US and Mexico suddenly lost altitude and emergency landed in October. At least 15 people were injured.The firm identified a problem with the aircraft's computing software which calculates a plane's elevation, and found that at high altitudes, data could be corrupted by intense radiation released periodically by the Sun. As well as the A320, the company's best-selling aircraft, the A318, A319 and the A321 models were also affected.Older planes that require new computers remain grounded. How long the replacement takes will depend on the availability of computers.",

    "body": "Thieves have stolen €90,000 (£79,000; $104,000) worth of snails from a farm in northern France that supplies gourmet restaurants.L'Escargot Des Grands Crus in Bouzy, near Reims, said it had been robbed of its entire stock of fresh and frozen snails - a \"real blow\" ahead of the holiday season.The thieves broke into the farm overnight into Monday, cutting a border fence before breaking into farm buildings, but a complaint was only filed with police later in the week, news site Franceinfo reported.Officers are now on the trail, while the farm is trying to restock to meet the end-of-year demand from customers.Edible snails - or escargot - are a French delicacy, usually cooked in garlic butter or wine before being extracted from their shell.Producers in France see a rise in sales around December, as people shell out to have the treat during Christmas and New Year's Day celebrations.\"This is definitely not the kind of post we thought we'd write as the holidays approach,\" L'Escargot Des Grands Crus wrote in a statement announcing the theft on Thursday.It went on to describe the incident as \"a shock, an incomprehension, and a real blow to the entire team\", adding: \"We are trying our best to replenish our stocks to satisfy you for the holidays.\"The farm has supplied restaurants including the Michelin-starred Les Crayères in Reims, as well as delicatessens and private clients, Franceinfo reports.Photos of the farm following the theft show shelves and fridges nearly completely cleared of snail products.\"A whole section of finished products was stolen from the store, and raw material stock from my laboratory,\" Jean-Mathieu Dauvergne, the farm's manager, told the news site.It was my end-of-year stock... We had just the right amount to get through the holidays without any worries.\"",

    "body": "At least four people have been killed in a mass shooting at a child's birthday party in California.Ten others were injured in the shooting at a restaurant on Saturday evening, in the state's northern city of Stockton.Local police say the victims include both adults and children. The conditions of the injured have not been confirmed.A suspect is still on the loose and police say they believe the shooting may have been \"targeted\".The San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office said the shooting happened shortly before 18:00 local time (02:00 GMT on Sunday), and is appealing to anyone with \"information, video footage, or who may have witnessed any part of the incident\" to come forward.Spokeswoman Heather Brent described the incident as \"unfathomable\", adding: \"This is a very active and ongoing investigation, and information remains limited. \"Early indications suggest this may be a targeted incident, and investigators are exploring all possibilities.\"Stockton's Mayor Christina Fugazi called the shooting \"unacceptable\".\"Families should be together instead of at the hospital, standing next to their loved one, praying that they survive.\"California has some of the strictest firearm laws in the US, and has in recent years faced challenges to it.In 2021, a federal judge overturned the state's ban on assault weapons, such as the AR-15 rifle. The following year, the US Supreme Court expanded gun rights as it struck down a New York law restricting gun-carrying rights, jeopardising similar regulation in California.''Families should be together instead of at the hospital'', says Stockton's mayor",

    "body": "More than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israel's military campaign in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The death toll has continued to rise since a ceasefire took effect on 10 October, with Israel carrying out air strikes for what it says are violations of the truce - while bodies continue to be recovered from under the rubble.Among those reportedly killed in an Israeli drone strike on Saturday were two young brothers, Fadi and Juma Abu Assi, whose family said they had been gathering firewood when they were killed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC they had struck two suspects who had crossed the so-called yellow line.The line marks where the Israeli military agreed to withdraw to under a ceasefire brokered by the United States more than seven weeks ago.The boys who died have been described in media reports as an eight-year-old and his brother, aged 10 or 11.Relatives said the children had been looking for firewood east of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip when they were killed.Their funeral was held at Nasser Hospital on Saturday.Figures from the Gaza Ministry of Health (MoH) have been widely used throughout the war and are seen as reliable by the United Nations (UN) and international institutions. But Israel has consistently disputed data published by Gaza's authorities.International journalists, including the BBC, are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently, so are unable to verify figures from either side.Gaza's Health Ministry says the Palestinian toll is now 70,100 and that more than 350 of those deaths have happened since the 10 October ceasefire. The Israeli military launched its offensive on Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",

The content being shared was not created or approved by us, and we have asked for it to be removed.\"While Keli Holiday is a friend of The Wiggles, the video and the music added to it were created independently and without our knowledge.\"The clip was filmed at the TikTok Awards earlier this month where members of the band appeared on stage with Holiday - whose real name is Adam Hyde - during his song Dancing2. Holiday shared the video on TikTok, with the caption \"The Wiggles get it\",  to promote his new single Ecstasy. The song's chorus lyrics are: \"Hey girl, come on dance with me. You and your pocket full of ecstasy.\"A spokesperson for The Wiggles told The West Australian newspaper that the band's performances at the awards had been \"family-friendly\" and that the video had been \"edited together separately and without our awareness\".Created in 1991 as part of a university assignment, The Wiggles has become an international phenomenon among young children. Anthony Fields is the only original member still with the group.Keli Holiday is the solo project of Hyde, who is also known for being one half of electronic dance duo Peking Duk.The BBC has contacted Holiday's management for comment.",

    "body": "34 minutes agoPaulin KolaEPANetanyahu said a pardon would lead to national reconciliation in IsraelIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has submitted a request for a pardon to the country's President Isaac Herzog.The president's office said Herzog would receive opinions from justice officials before considering the \"extraordinary request which carries with it significant implications\".  Netanyahu has been standing trial for the past five years on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three separate cases. He denies any wrongdoing. He said in a video message that he would have preferred to see the process to the end, but national interest \"demanded otherwise\". Early this month, US President Donald Trump urged Herzog to \"fully pardon\" the prime minister. At the time, Herzog made it clear that anyone seeking a pardon had to submit a formal request.On Sunday, the president's office released the request and a letter by the prime minister himself, in light of \"the importance of this extraordinary request and its implications\".It offered no indication of when the president might reach a decision.In 2020, Netanyahu became the first serving Israeli prime minister to stand trial.In the first case, prosecutors alleged that he received gifts - mainly cigars and bottles of champagne - from powerful businessmen in exchange for favours.He is accused in a second case of offering to help improve the circulation of an Israeli newspaper in exchange for positive coverage.And in a third, prosecutors have alleged that he promoted regulatory decisions favourable to the controlling shareholder of an Israeli telecoms company in exchange for positive coverage by a news website.Netanyahu has pleaded not guilty to all the charges and branded the trial as a \"witch-hunt\" by political opponents.He said in Sunday's video message that the continuation of the trial \"tears us apart from within\" at a time when Israel was facing \"enormous challenges, and alongside them great opportunities\" that required unity.\"I am certain, as are many others in the nation, that an immediate end to the trial would greatly help lower the flames and promote broad reconciliation - something our country desperately needs,\" the prime minister added.According to Israel's Basic Law, the president \"has the power to pardon criminals and reduce or transmute [alter] their sentence\".However, Israel's High Court of Justice has previously ruled that the president could pardon an individual before they are convicted if it is in the public interest or if there are extreme personal circumstances.Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party and his supporters have always supported a  pardon for their leader.But for many in Israel - especially on the left - it would be seen as another move away from the country's sense of itself as a robust democracy with a strong legal system.It was public fears that this was under attack with the government's plans for judicial reforms that brought hundreds of thousands out onto the streets in protest for many months before the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023 that triggered the most recent Gaza war.",

    "body": "Pope Leo XIV has visited Istanbul's Sultan Ahmed Mosque - widely known as the Blue Mosque - in his first visit to a Muslim place of worship since he took up the papacy in May.The Pontiff was seen bowing as he entered the building, but it is reported he did not pray at the mosque, as his two predecessors had done.The Vatican said in a statement Leo undertook the tour \"in a spirit of reflection and listening, with deep respect for the place and for the faith of those who gather there in prayer\".The Pope is on a four-day trip to Turkey, after which he will visit Lebanon.He was later welcomed to St George's Cathedral in Istanbul by the head of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Patriarch Bartholomew.The Blue Mosque is officially named for Sultan Ahmed I, leader of the Ottoman Empire from 1603 to 1617, who oversaw its construction. It is decorated with thousands of blue and turquoise ceramic tiles and receives millions of visitors each year.Pope Francis prayed there in 2014, and Pope Benedict XVI did so in 2006.The first pope to officially enter a mosque was John Paul II, who made history when he visited the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus in 2001. The papal visit to Turkey and Lebanon had been planned by late Pope Francis, but its theme of building bridges was embraced by Pope Leo from the moment he stepped on the balcony of St Peter's Basilica after his election in May.At the start of his trip, he warned that the world should not give into \"a heightened level of conflict on the global level\", adding that \"the future of humanity is at stake\".In Lebanon - where an estimated third of the country is Christian - he is expected to meet more faith leaders and hear from young people. On the final day of the trip, he will celebrate Mass at the Beirut waterfront at the site of the 2020 port explosion, praying for the more than 200 people who were killed and 7,000 others injured.",

The Labor leader's proposal and the wedding reception both took place at his official residence, The Lodge.ReutersAlbanese (right) alongside his son Nathan and his dog Toto - the ring bearerUntil the big day, the wedding plans had been kept under wraps due to concerns about security and potential disruptions.In attendance were Jodie Haydon's parents as well as Albanese's son, Nathan, from his previous marriage.Albanese's dog Toto acted as ring bearer while the couple walked back down the aisle to Stevie Wonder's \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours)\".The prime minister also shared a video on his official social media accounts showing the happy couple walking down the aisle as guests showered them in confetti. Several of Albanese's cabinet ministers attended the ceremony. ReutersAt the reception, their first dance was to The Way You Look Tonight by Frank Sinatra.The celebrations also featured custom-made beer cans printed with the image used to announce their engagement.The couple are set to honeymoon in Australia from Monday to Friday next week - plans that were pared back after his re-election in May.Albanese, 62, and Jodie Haydon, 47, first met at a business dinner in Melbourne in 2020, while he was leader of the opposition.ReutersShe appeared during Albanese's 2022 and 2025 election campaigns, and was seen alongside the PM at major events, including the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II and a state dinner hosted by former US President Joe Biden.Albanese also made Australian history by becoming the first prime minister to get engaged while in office.The couple said in a joint statement at the time that they were \"so lucky to have found each other\".",

    "body": "Donald Trump has said that he will pardon the former president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted of drug trafficking charges in a US court last year. The US president said Hernández had been \"treated very harshly and unfairly\" in a social media post announcing the move on Friday.Hernández was found guilty in March 2024 of conspiring to import cocaine into the US, and of possessing machine guns. He was sentenced to 45 years in prison.Trump also threw his support behind conservative presidential candidate Nasry \"Tito\" Asfura in the Central American nation's general election, due to be held on Sunday.Hernández, a member of the National Party, who served as Honduras's president from 2014 to 2022, was extradited to the US in April 2022 to stand trial for running a violent drug trafficking conspiracy and helping to smuggle hundreds of tons of cocaine to the US. During his trial, prosecutors in New York said Hernández ran the Central American country like a \"narco-state\" and accepted millions of dollars in bribes from drug traffickers to shield them from the law.He was also ordered to pay a fine of $8m (£6m) as part of his sentence. Polls indicate this year's Honduran election remains a toss-up between three candidates including Asfura, the former mayor of Tegucigalpa and leader of the conservative National Party.Also in the running is Rixi Moncada, a former defence minister standing for the ruling left-wing Libre Party, and Salvador Nasralla, a television host with the centrist Liberal Party.Trump criticised Moncada and Nasralla on Friday, writing that the latter was \"a boderline Communist\" who was only running to split the vote between Moncada and Asfura.He characterised Asfura as \"standing up for democracy\" and praised him for campaigning against Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro, with whom Trump has engaged in a war of words in recent months.Nasralla has pledged to cut ties with Venezuela if he wins.Moncada used a news conference on Saturday to accuse Trump of \"interventionist\" meddling after his endorsement of Asfura and his plans to pardon Hernández.The Trump administration has accused the left-wing Maduro - whose re-election last year was dismissed as illegitimate by many countries - of being the leader of a drugs cartel.It used countering drug trafficking as a justification for a military build-up in the Caribbean and has conducted strikes on vessels it says have been used for smuggling - though some analysts have described these moves as a means of pressuring Latin American leaders.Honduras has been governed since 2022 by President Xiomara Castro, who has forged close ties with Cuba and Venezuela.But Castro has maintained a co-operative relationship with the US, agreeing to preserve a long-running extradition treaty with it. Her country also hosts a US military base involved in targeting transnational organised crime in the region. More than 80 people have been killed in the US strikes on vessels suspected of being involved in the transport of narcotics since they began in August.US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth has said the aim of \"Operation Southern Spear\" was to eliminate \"narcoterrorists\". But legal experts have questioned the legality of the strikes, pointing out that the US has provided no evidence that the boats it has targeted were carrying drugs.",

    "body": "Venezuela has reacted angrily to US President Donald Trump's statement that the airspace around the country should be considered closed.The country's foreign ministry called Trump's comments \"another extravagant, illegal and unjustified aggression against the Venezuelan people\". The US does not have legal authority to close another country's airspace and the Venezuelan statement accused Trump of making a \"colonialist threat\". The US has built its military presence in the area and carried out at least 21 strikes on boats it says were carrying drugs, killing more than 80. It has not provided evidence and Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro says the US moves are an attempt to oust him. Trump wrote on Truth Social: \"To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.\"The White House did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.With Trump ratcheting up his threats, some Democratic and Republican members of the US Congress have expressed anger that he has not sought legislative approval.\"Trump's reckless actions towards Venezuela are pushing America closer and closer to another costly foreign war,\" top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer posted on X on Sunday.\"Under our constitution, Congress has the sole power to declare war.\"Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, until recently a close Trump ally, said: \"Reminder, Congress has the sole power to declare war.\"Trump's comments come just days after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned airlines of \"heightened military activity in and around Venezuela\", leading to several major airlines suspending flights there. Caracas then rescinded their take-off and landing rights.Venezuela's foreign ministry urged \"the international community, the sovereign governments of the world, the UN, and the relevant multilateral organisations to firmly reject this immoral act of aggression\", in a statement on Saturday. The same day, Venezuela's military conducted exercises along coastal areas, with state TV showing anti-aircraft weapons and other artillery being manoeuvred.The US has deployed the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, and about 15,000 troops to within striking distance of Venezuela.It has insisted that the deployment - the largest by the US in the region since it invaded Panama in 1989 - is to combat drug trafficking.Trump warned on Thursday that US efforts to halt Venezuelan drug trafficking \"by land\" would begin \"very soon\". The Venezuelan government believes the aim of the US is to depose the left-wing Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced by the Venezuelan opposition and many nations as rigged.Fellow left-wing President Gustavo Petro of Colombia - who has also faced US sanctions - has said he believed the US was using \"violence to dominate\" Latin America, though other leaders in the region have welcomed Trump's stance.The US has also designated Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns – a group it alleges is headed by Maduro – as a foreign terrorist organisation.Labelling an organisation as a terrorist group gives US law enforcement and military agencies broader powers to target and dismantle it.Venezuela's foreign ministry has \"categorically, firmly, and absolutely rejected\" the designation.",

    "body": "6 hours agoDanny AeberhardandTom BennettUkrainian naval drones hit two oil tankers from Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\" as they travelled through the Black Sea, Ukrainian officials have said.Footage verified by the BBC shows waterborne drones speeding through the waves into the vessels, before detonating into a ball of flame, sending black smoke into the air.The targeted tankers were named by Turkish authorities as the Kairos and Virat, both flagged to the Gambia. Both were hit off the Turkish coast on Friday, with the Virat reportedly struck again on Saturday. No casualties were reported. The attacks appear to be an escalation by Kyiv as it tries to hit Russia's oil revenues, which are critical for funding its war in Ukraine.The two ships are reportedly part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" - a term that refers to the hundreds of tankers used by Russia to bypass Western sanctions imposed after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.The shadow fleet is largely made up of aged tankers, many with obscure ownership or insurance.The Kairos was struck in the south-west area of the Black Sea and the Virat in a central area further east. Both are on a list of ships subject to sanctions, according to London Stock Exchange data.The attack employed Sea Baby drones - a type of naval drone produced by Ukraine's security services, known as the SBU.Turkish authorities said they had been assisting the vessels, and released footage showing two Turkish boats trying to extinguish the fire on the Kairos.The attacks are seen as a warning by Ukraine, suggesting that ships carrying Russian oil in the Black Sea face the risk of direct attack, not just Western sanctions.Separately, a major consortium transporting oil from the Caspian region said it had suspended loading in the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, after an attack by unmanned boats overnight.The Caspian Pipeline Consortium said the attack had caused significant damage to a mooring point. Russia and Kazakhstan are major stakeholders in the company, which is also part-owned by Western firms including Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Shell.Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister Aibek Smadiyarov expressed his indignation with the attack, which he said was the third of its kind.He said Kazakhstan attached particular importance to ensuring a \"stable and uninterrupted\" energy supply.The incident had harmed relations between his country and Ukraine, Smadiyarov added, calling on Kyiv \"to take concrete measures to prevent the recurrence of such situations\".Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that a delegation led by top security official Rustem Umerov was on its way to the US to continue talks on an agreement to end the war. Umerov is set to lead the Ukrainian delegation as the previous lead negotiator, Zelensky's influential chief of staff Andriy Yermak, resigned after anti-corruption detectives searched his apartment on Friday. The Ukrainian delegation is expected to meet US officials in Florida on Sunday. Steve Witkoff, US President Donald Trump's overseas envoy, will hold talks in Moscow next week.",

    "body": "24 hours agoAleks PhillipsandYang TianMore than 600,000 people in the Kyiv region of Ukraine were without power on Saturday morning after an overnight Russian attack.Ukraine's energy ministry said more than 500,000 of these were in the capital itself, with the rest in the surrounding region. It attributed the power losses to missile and drone strikes on energy infrastructure in the city and several other regions.Around 36 missiles and nearly 600 drones were launched on targets across Ukraine overnight, officials said, killing three and injuring dozens of others.Russia has intensified attacks on Ukrainian civilian and energy infrastructure as the embattled nation heads into winter, despite US-led efforts to secure a peace deal.Russia's defence ministry said it had launched \"a massive strike... against Ukrainian military-industrial complex enterprises and the energy facilities that support their operation\".Dtek Energy, which serves properties in Kyiv, said later on Saturday that power had been restored to more than 360,000 families.As well as energy infrastructure, several residential buildings were hit in the overnight strikes, Ukrainian officials said.Loud explosions were heard across Kyiv early on Saturday morning. Emergency services were later seen attending to burning blocks of flats damaged by strikes.Kyiv's Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said a 13-year-old child was among the 29 people injured in the capital city.Ukraine's Air Force said it shot down 558 of the drones and 19 of the missiles.Kyiv is among several cities that have suffered regular aerial bombardment since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Many Ukrainians have also had to live through regular blackouts, as Moscow has targeted energy infrastructure in previous winters.On Sunday it is forecast to fall to 2C in Kyiv, which has average temperatures below freezing in December.Ukraine has targeted Russian energy infrastructure, including oil refineries and depots, in particular with long-range weaponry that can probe deep inside Russia. It says this is to curb revenue for Moscow's war effort from Russia's main export.Meanwhile Ukrainian media is reporting that Ukrainian maritime drones struck two oil tankers in the Black Sea on Friday, which are thought to be part of Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\" of vessels used to evade Western sanctions.Video footage published online and verified by the BBC shows a waterborne drone barrelling towards one of the boats, before another video shows fire and smoke billowing out of the vessel's side.The stricken tankers are named Kairos and Virat, according to Turkish authorities. Both are flagged to Gambia. Footage released by Turkey's Transport Ministry shows two of its own boats trying to extinguish the fire on the Kairos.The latest bombardment came as Ukrainian negotiators were preparing for talks with US officials this weekend. US President Donald Trump is pushing for the two sides to accept a draft peace plan, which was initially slanted heavily in favour of Russia but subsequently revised during talks with Ukrainians and their European allies in Geneva.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has welcomed the diplomatic efforts while stressing Kyiv's need to retain its sovereignty and ability to fend off any future attack.On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin repeated his core demands for ending the war, saying Russia would only halt its offensive if Ukraine's troops withdrew from territory claimed by Moscow.Russian forces currently control most - but not all - of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, as well as a portion of the southern Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. US and European allies have called for the war to be frozen along the current front line.Putin also confirmed a US delegation including special envoy Steve Witkoff was expected in Moscow in the first half of next week to discuss the draft peace plan.",

    "body": "10 minutes agoHafsa KhalilReutersAt least 146 people are known to have died in a devastating fire that tore through multiple high-rise buildings in Hong Kong.Police announced the death toll in a news conference on Sunday, cautioning that they \"cannot rule out the possibility of further fatalities\". A further 79 are injured and 150 remain missing, they said.Seven of eight tower blocks in a housing in the northerly Tai Po district rapidly went up in flames on Wednesday. Accusations the fire was helped by flammable materials on the outside of the buildings has sparked anger and concern.Thousands are gathering at the Wang Fuk Court complex on Sunday to mourn the victims, with queues stretching to almost 2km.The death toll has been rising since the fire began, as officials work to recover and identify bodies.The exact cause of the blaze has yet to be determined. Eight people have been arrested on suspicion of corruption over the renovations that had been taking place on the towers, while three others were detained on manslaughter charges.The fire - which spread quickly both upwards and between the blocks - was only fully doused by Friday morning, and took more than 2,000 firefighters to bring under control.The same day, police began entering the buildings to gather evidence. Authorities say the investigation could take three to four weeks.Police official Tsang Shuk-yin said on Sunday that officers had so far completed searches of four of the tower blocks.Indonesia's consulate in Hong Kong said at least seven of its nationals had died from the fire, while the Philippines' consulate said one of its citizens had.Firefighter Ho Wai-ho, 37, has been identified as among those killed. He was found collapsed at the scene on Wednesday, about 30 minutes after contact with him was lost.The fire department said the fire reached a peak temperature of 500C (932F). Twelve firefighters were injured battling the blaze.The fire spread quickly across the separate blocks due to the presence of plastic netting and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings, officials have said.The tower blocks were also covered in bamboo scaffolding, which is commonly used for construction and renovation work in Hong Kong. The fire has sparked a debate about whether it should still be used.Several residents have said they did not hear a fire alarm when the fire broke out. Hong Kong's fire service found that fire alarms in all eight blocks were not working effectively.The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said that those arrested in the corruption probe included directors at an engineering company and scaffolding subcontractors. A police spokesperson previously said they have reason to believe \"those in charge at the company were grossly negligent\", which led to the fire and caused it to \"spread uncontrollably\".Hong Kong's buildings department has temporarily suspended works on 30 private projects.Police reportedly detained a 24-year-old man on suspicion of sedition on Saturday. He was part of a group petitioning for an independent probe into the fire.Ching Sze Yip/BBCChing Sze Yip/BBCAmong the tributes added are handwritten messages for the victims of the fireHundreds of flower bouquets have been laid down as people queue to mourn and pay their respectsThe fire - Hong Kong's deadliest in more than 70 years - led the region's authority to declare a three-day mourning period, which began on Saturday.Officials observed a three minutes' silence to mark the start of the period, while the flags of China and Hong Kong were flown at half-mast.Thousands of people have been visiting the scene to lay down flowers and pray, as well as offer handwritten messages for victims.Indonesian worker Romlah Rosidah said she was \"very surprised\" with how many people turned up to pray for the victims.\"This event was only spread on social media, but [it] turned out their hearts moved,\" she told news agency Reuters.One Filipino worker said they joined the prayers in solidarity, as well as \"to show the Hong Kong community that we are one in this situation\".Wang Fuk Court was built in 1983 and had provided 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census.Nearly 40% of its residents are estimated to be at least 65 years old. Some have lived in the subsidised housing estate since it was built.Hong Kong's second-deadliest fire on record killed 176 people in 1948 and was caused by a ground-floor explosion at a five-storey warehouse. The most deadly was at Happy Valley Racecourse in 1918, when more than 600 people died. ",

    "body": "1 day agoNatasha Booty,Chris Ewokor,AbujaandChiagozie Nwonwu,LagosThe Nigerian government says jihadist groups Boko Haram and Islamic State in West Africa Province (Iswap) are behind the recent wave of abductions in north-western and central Nigeria, but this has been disputed by analysts who tell the BBC they were committed by criminal gangs locally known as \"bandits\".This is the first time the government has stated who it believes is responsible for the kidnappings but it has not revealed any evidence to back its claims.Kidnap for ransom has become big business in parts of Nigeria in recent years - with the culprits ranging from kidnap gangs, jihadists and separatists.It is a lucrative money-spinner but officials consistently deny paying ransoms.In the past fortnight alone, there have been three mass kidnappings in the region:17 November - in Maga, Kebbi state, at Government Girls Comprehensive secondary school. Two people were killed and 25 abducted including one teacher - now all free18 November - in Eruku, Kwara state, at Christ Apostolic Church. Two were killed and 38 abducted - all since freed21 November - in Papiri, Niger state, at St Mary's Catholic School. More than 250 children and 12 members of staff reportedly kidnapped, although officials question these figuresPaying ransoms has been made illegal in Nigeria, although there are allegations this ban has been widely ignored.Speaking to the BBC, presidential spokesman Sunday Dare would not say whether money had been paid to free the minority of abductees who were recently released, simply stating: \"Whatever processes are involved - kinetic, non-kinetic, negotiations, etc - have been successful.\"Asked who was behind the kidnappings, he replied: \"Abundant data - both nationally and internationally - reveals clearly that Iswap are all over the place. Also, whatever is left of Boko Haram, they are right there,\" he continued. \"They are the ones involved in this process.\"Iswap is a splinter group of Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which has been waging an insurgency in north-eastern Nigeria for more than a decade.Mr Dare also reiterated President Bola Tinubu's promise to ensure the remaining abductees would be rescued, but failed to give assurances on how long it would take.In some of the worst cases in the past, kidnapped children have died at the hands of their captors - or been held for years on end, as in the case of the infamous Chibok kidnappings by Boko Haram.Analyst Bulama Bukarti told the BBC he did not agree with the government's claims that jihadist groups were behind the recent wave of kidnappings.\"I don't think that's accurate. There is no Iswap or Boko Haram cell resident in the north-west. The recent kidnappings, including the mass abductions, were carried out by bandits, not Boko Haram or Iswap,\" he said.The bandits are local armed groups, often on motorbikes, with no central organisation, who operate mainly in the north-west. Whereas Boko Haram and Iswap mainly operate hundreds of miles away, in Nigeria's north-east.The BBC asked Acled - an international monitoring group that analyses attacks by armed groups - to assess the three kidnappings.Acled said in all three cases Fulani militia groups, locally called \"bandits\", were responsible for the kidnappings.Fulani herders have come into conflict with both Muslim and Christian communities across Nigeria.It said the biggest of the recent kidnappings, in which more than 200 schoolchildren were reportedly abducted from St Mary's Catholic School, \"appears to have been partly carried out to spite the government and achieve some political objectives\".The church attack in southern Kwara state was \"part of the Fulani expansionist drive, and as a way to displace the locals from the communities for illegal mining activities\", Acled told the BBC. \"Local displacement for mining has become the emerging pattern of the Fulani militia activities as seen in Zamfara state and the Birnin Gwari area of Kaduna state.\"Shortly after the mass kidnappings in north-western and central Nigeria, 13 teenage girls were abducted in north-eastern Borno state, the stronghold of Boko Haram. Analysts agree that this is likely to have been the work of jihadist groups.Nigeria's security crisis has been thrown into the international spotlight in recent weeks after US President Donald Trump threatened to send over troops \"guns a-blazing\" if the government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\". Nigerian officials and analysts say that members of all faiths are victims of the violence and kidnappings, and say it is not true that Christians are being targeted.",

    "body": "Fall of Zelensky's top aide - reboot for Kyiv or costly shake-up?1 day agoJames WaterhouseUkraine correspondent, KyivReutersAndriy Yermak was one of Ukraine's most powerful figuresAndriy Yermak was a constant, looming presence in Ukraine's government - a seemingly immovable figure on the political stage.Despite his towering frame, you might not always have spotted him. Yet, wherever President Volodymyr Zelensky was, Yermak was often not far away.As his chief of staff, Yermak wielded enormous power at the top of government and was even trusted to negotiate on Ukraine's behalf at peace talks with the US.But as his influence grew, so did public resentment of the power this unelected official held. His political career came to an abrupt end on Friday, hours after anti-corruption investigators raided his home in Kyiv.Yermak and Zelensky first met in 2011 when the former was an intellectual property lawyer and the latter a TV producer.After working together during the successful presidential campaign of 2019, Yermak became Zelensky's chief of staff. He stood next to the president as he gave his now famous \"we are still here\" speech as the Russians descended on Kyiv at the start of their full-scale invasion in February 2022.As Zelensky concentrated his power over time, Yermak was widely viewed as the second most powerful person in Ukraine. He reportedly helped shape foreign policy, ousted political rivals and even made battlefield decisions.ReutersYermak (right) was always at the centre of the action in Ukraine's governmentUkrainian politics is shaped by big characters, and Zelensky's administration had not one, but two of them.Despite the favourable conditions Yermak enjoyed within the sprawling Presidential Office, the same couldn't be said outside its steep walls.His popularity was nosediving.A widening scandalZelensky had successfully grappled with corruption scandals in the past, but in July a chain of events began that has shaken the current government to its core, weakening him politically and costing him his right-hand man.That month, the president convinced parliament to formally remove the independence of Ukraine's two anti-corruption bodies and bring them under direct government control.At the time, Zelensky said it was to limit Russian interference. But the public - as well as the European Union - disagreed, and he was forced to U-turn after mass demonstrations.Getty ImagesThe decision to strip anti-corruption bodies of their independence sparked mass protests, which in turn forced a government U-turnBy the autumn, those same agencies, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and the Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sapo), released the findings of a lengthy investigation that implicated members of Zelensky's inner circles.Senior figures - including two ministers, a former deputy prime minister and a one-time business partner of Zelensky's - were accused of syphoning $100m (£75m) from public projects in the energy sector.At a time when Russia is pummelling Ukraine's energy grid with missiles and drones ahead of a fourth winter of war - forcing the entire country to endure daily power cuts - public anger at these corruption allegations has soared. Just on Friday night alone, Kyiv endured a nearly 11-hour-long Russian air raid, which left more than half a million people without power.\"We're going through one of the most difficult times in our history,\" Iryna, a Kyiv resident, told the BBC this week. \"Unfortunately, lots of families will not see their loved ones, their men, brothers or husbands, because of the war.\"Despite not being named as a suspect and denying any involvement in the scheme, Andriy Yermak couldn't distance himself. There was a suspicion he may have known something. Local media reported on Saturday that investigators were combing through several laptops and mobile phones they had seized from his flat during their search.Yermak led last week's talks with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Geneva, apparently securing some concessions for his country in a US-drafted peace proposal which many feared heavily favoured Russia.Getty ImagesMr Yermak was a key figure in negotiations with the USAt a time when Ukraine is fighting and negotiating for its very survival, his resignation is hugely destabilising.Talks will continue next week. Ukraine's presidential office said on Saturday that Defence Minister Rustem Umerov was the head of a delegation heading to the US.What is not known is whether this will be a timely reboot for Kyiv, or a costly lack of continuity.It is also not known how Yermak is taking his sudden departure from government. The New York Post reported on Saturday that he had texted their paper and vowed to go to the front line. He also declared his innocence. \"I'm going to the front and am prepared for any reprisals,\" he reportedly said. \"I am an honest and decent person.\"But there is a feeling that Yermak's departure is a sign of positive change.\"Let's call it what it is: good news,\" says Olga Rudenko, editor of the Kyiv Independent.\"Think about it: a young democracy like Ukraine has independent institutions that are strong enough to investigate the most powerful man in the country - and to do so during the war.\"People rooting for Ukraine around the world aren't rooting for a place on the map, but for a place living by certain values - and fighting for them. Today we see these values in action.\"This shows why Ukraine is exactly the country worth supporting.\"Additional reporting by Toby Luckhurst",

    "body": "6 hours agoScott DuffieldGetty ImagesThree African countries have agreed to take back foreign offenders and illegal migrants after the UK Home Secretary threatened them with visa penalties.In December - following threats from Shabana Mahmood - Namibia and Angola agreed to cooperate on returns. The home secretary has now also secured cooperation from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\"My message is clear: if foreign governments refuse to accept the return of their citizens, then they will face consequences,\" she said following the agreement.The UK government had previously warned it would stop granting visas to people from Angola, Namibia and the DRC if their governments did not improve co-operation on removals.The Home Office had said that returns from the DRC, Angola and Namibia were being frustrated - with paperwork not being processed or people being required to sign their own documents - giving them an effective veto. It had warned that the three countries faced penalties for their \"unacceptably poor and obstructive returns processes\".While setting out changes to the UK's asylum system in November, Mahmood said visa penalties would be applied to countries that failed to co-operate with returns policies. Penalties included an \"emergency brake\" on visas for countries with high asylum claims until they take back citizens in the UK illegally.Following the agreement with the three countries, Mahmood said: \"Illegal migrants and dangerous criminals will now be removed and deported back to Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\"\"I will do what it takes to secure our order and control to our borders,\" she added.The government says over 3,000 people from these three countries could be eligible to be removed or deported due to the cooperation.In the year ending September 2025, there were 36,475 returns and deportations from the UK, an 11% increase on the previous 12 months. Around 5,000 of the returns were foreign national offenders - 48% came from EU countries and 52% came from non-EU countries.  The Home Secretary has indicated that ​countries which refuse to work with the UK on returns cannot expect a normal visa relationship, with further threats expected for lack of cooperation.It is understood that India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Somalia and Gabon are all resistant to returns deals and it is possible that the government could look at sanctions for those countries.The government hopes that increasing the return of illegal migrants will deter people from trying to get to the UK by crossing the English Channel in small boats. Last year, 41,472 migrants made the journey, a 13% rise on the year before. At the end of last year, European countries including the UK agreed to negotiate a new approach to interpreting the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) to make it easier to deport illegal migrants. The Conservatives have said they would leave the treaty with party leader Kemi Badenoch arguing it was a necessary step to \"protect our borders\". ",

    "body": "Trump and the NFL - why it's complicatedImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell joined Donald Trump in the Oval Office in MayByBen CollinsBBC Sport journalist in San FranciscoUpdated 6 hours agoAmerican football fans never thought they would see the day - the head of the National Football League standing shoulder to shoulder with Donald Trump in the Oval Office.Trump has frequently traded blows with the NFL since he first became US president in 2017, but he and America's most popular sports league have been sparring partners for more than 40 years.Trump's 'feud' with the NFL has involved him testifying against the league and failing, on multiple occasions, to buy a team. It may even have propelled him to the presidency.When NFL commissioner Roger Goodell joined Trump in May to announce the NFL Draft would be coming to Washington DC for the first time, it seemed Trump had finally made friends with arguably his oldest foe.Well, maybe not. With this season set to conclude with Super Bowl 60 on Sunday, BBC Sport examines Trump's long and complicated relationship with the NFL and why it could be set for another twist.Lawsuit fails to force league mergerImage source, APImage caption, Herschel Walker racked up a record 2,411 rushing yards for the Generals in 1985 and is now the US ambassador to the Bahamas after being nominated by TrumpAlready a real-estate magnate by that point, Trump viewed owning an American football team as a means of building his brand. After attempting to acquire an NFL franchise, a 37-year-old Trump bought the New Jersey Generals in September 1983.They were founding members of the USFL, which started in the spring of 1983 so did not clash with the NFL. The new league managed to lure top players from the NFL and the college game.The Generals improved during their two seasons under Trump but lost in the first round of the play-offs in both 1984 and 1985.However, Trump had made his intentions clear from the outset. He didn't want the USFL to remain a spring league; he wanted to go directly against the NFL in autumn-winter.That was not the USFL's original plan but, in August 1984, Trump convinced team owners to vote on switching to an autumn-winter schedule from 1986.Then, two months, later the USFL filed an anti-trust lawsuit against the NFL - led by Trump. The case went to trial in May 1986, with the USFL arguing the NFL had conspired to monopolise TV contracts, seeking damages worth $1.7bn (£1.25bn).Trump hoped it would force a league merger and earn him an NFL franchise. He also envisaged a Trump-branded stadium in Manhattan.The trial lasted 42 days and a jury found the NFL was an 'illegal monopoly'. But it rejected the other charges and the USFL was awarded just $3 as the jury felt most of the USFL's problems were self-inflicted.The league had built up huge debt and, days after the verdict, it folded.In a book about the USFL,, external one of the jurors said Trump \"came off as arrogant and unlikeable\" in court.Trump and then NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle provided contrasting accounts of a meeting they had in March 1984, during which Rozelle is alleged to have told Trump, external \"as long as I or any of my heirs are involved in the NFL, you will never be a franchise owner in the league\".Did failed Bills bid lead to presidential run?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Trump's lawyer Christopher Kise (right) argued his bid to buy the Buffalo Bills was not relevant to his fraud trial as the deal was not completedTrump had already attempted to buy the Baltimore Colts, before the NFL franchise relocated to Indianapolis in 1984.He then turned down the chance to buy the Dallas Cowboys for $50m in 1984 and bought the Generals instead for $9m. \"I feel sorry for the poor guy who is going to buy the Dallas Cowboys,\" he told the New York Times.Jerry Jones became the Cowboys' owner in 1989. 'America's Team' won three Super Bowls in the '90s and are now the world's most valuable sports team at $10.1bn (£7.5bn)., externalAfter the USFL's demise, Trump pulled out of discussions in 1988 to buy the New England Patriots, who have won six Super Bowls under current owner Robert Kraft.Trump focused on other enterprises, becoming a reality TV star on The Apprentice, until the Buffalo Bills were put up for sale in 2014.Trump claims he bid $1bn in cash but Terry Pegula, who already owned the NHL's Buffalo Sabres, ultimately bought the Bills for $1.4bn.That bidding process was mentioned during the fraud trial that ruled against Trump - who had denied all accusations - in 2024, before his $500m (£372m) penalty was overturned last week. His former lawyer Michael Cohen used it as an example of how he would inflate Trump's assets, in that case claiming a net worth of $8bn in a bid to secure a loan to buy the Bills.Documents also showed Trump declined to provide financial statements to the Bills' bankers - one of whom testified that, instead, Trump \"gave us handouts of the Forbes list of the top-paid entertainers\".ESPN analyst Stephen A. Smith has repeatedly claimed that before Pegula's takeover was approved by NFL team owners in October 2014, he received a call from Trump in which he said: \"If they screw me over, I am going to show them. I'm going to get them all back. I'm going to run for president.\"Eight months later, Trump announced he was doing just that. He later said: \"If I bought that team, I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing.''Media caption, Trump attacked dissenting NFL players at a rally in AlabamaIt was during Trump's first presidential run that NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick began taking the knee during America's national anthem, to protest against racial injustice and police brutality in the US.Many NFL players followed suit and Trump was a vocal critic, before and after he was elected in November 2016.During a rally in September 2017, Trump urged fans to boycott games and NFL team owners to sack any players who did not stand for the anthem. He also called for the league to change its rules, regarding both the protests and the game itself.The following day NFL commissioner Goodell issued a statement, in which he said: \"Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL.\"Patriots owner Kraft told BBC Sport that Trump's comments on the anthem protests were \"inflammatory and inappropriate\". In a meeting between players and owners in October 2017,, external Kraft added: \"We have a president who will use that as fodder to do his mission, that I don't feel is in the best interests of America\".After a team owners' meeting in the same month, the Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shahid Khan told USA Today, external that Trump was \"trying to soil a league or a brand that he's jealous of\".Khan added: \"He's been elected president, where maybe a great goal he had in life to own an NFL team is not very likely, so to make it tougher, or to hurt the league, it's very calculated.\"Trump said he \"would love\" to see Kaepernick return to the NFL as it continued to struggle with the anthem issue.In May 2018, the NFL introduced a new policy giving players the option to stand or stay in the locker room but, in the wake of George Floyd's death, Goodell admitted the NFL was wrong and encouraged players to peacefully protest.Smith has said Trump \"hijacked the narrative\" over Kaepernick \"for his own benefit\", while his ESPN colleague Adam Schefter said Trump was \"waging his own little vendetta against the NFL\".Added intrigue around White House visitsImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The Patriots were the first Super Bowl winners after Trump's first inauguration, with owner Robert Kraft (right) among those to visit the White House in April 2017The tradition of championship teams visiting the White House started long before Trump took office, but now there is far greater attention on who is invited and whether they will attend.Half of the Patriots team did not travel in 2017, including quarterback Tom Brady, with five of those players citing political objections to Trump.The following year he revoked an invitation to the Philadelphia Eagles the day before the planned visit, after most of the team said they would not attend.The Patriots were asked to return in 2019, but both parties were unable to schedule a date, while the Covid pandemic ruled out any chance of the Kansas City Chiefs visiting in 2020.Three weeks after Trump's second inauguration in January he watched the Eagles beat the Chiefs, and this time they did visit the White House in April.Less than half the team attended, quarterback Jalen Hurts among those not present, although a White House official said he and the other absentees had \"scheduling conflicts\".Trump has also invited the Chiefs as they \"missed their turn\" in 2020, even though  one of the few remaining players is Travis Kelce, who is engaged to Taylor Swift.Trump said he \"hated\" Swift after she endorsed his rival presidential candidate Kamala Harris in 2024, and celebrated the singer being booed at last year's Super Bowl.But Trump congratulated them on their engagement in August and said Swift is a \"terrific person\" so perhaps Kelce would visit, if the Chiefs can fix a date.Could Trump create more NFL history?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Josh Harris (left) and Goodell (centre) joined Trump in the Oval Office, with Harris presenting him with a ball that read \"in recognition of\" Trump \"bringing the NFL Draft to the nation's capital\" After becoming the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl last February, Trump looked to have achieved a complete turnaround with the NFL when Goodell and the Washington Commanders owner Josh Harris joined him at the White House to announce the US capital would host the 2027 draft.The news came a week after the Commanders reached an agreement to build a $4bn (£3bn) domed stadium in Washington DC, which Goodell acknowledged would \"dramatically\" boost the district's chances of hosting a Super Bowl.The local council approved the deal in August, so Trump could become the first president to bring the nation's biggest sporting event to its capital city.But Trump said he may block those plans if the \"Washington 'Whatevers''\" do not \"change the name back\". The team won three Super Bowls while known by a name which is considered offensive to Native Americans and was dropped in 2020.Some say you should never mix sport with politics, but Trump continues to embrace it more than any of his predecessors.Last July, he reintroduced the presidential fitness test to American schools and announced a sports council including high-profile figures such as Goodell and several NFL players, although Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa \"didn't know too much about it\" and Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley said he had declined his invitation.But the league appears to have irked Trump yet again by choosing Puerto Rican pop star Bad Bunny to perform the Super Bowl half-time show in Santa Clara on Sunday and American band Green Day to play the opening ceremony.Both acts have been critical of Trump and his administration's immigration crackdown. The president responded by saying \"I'm anti-them. I think it's a terrible choice\", but insists the reason he is not attending Sunday's game in Santa Clara, California, is because it is \"just too far away\".While Trump feels that choosing those performers will only \"sow hatred\", commissioner Goodell believes it will \"unite people\". If Bad Bunny uses the huge platform the NFL has given him to make another statement against Trump, it's fair to assume he'll be planing how to strike the league back.This story was first published on 28 August 2025.",

    "body": "17 hours agoJaroslav LukivNurPhoto via Getty ImagesThorbjørn Jagland's lawyer promised his client's full co-operation with the investigationPolice in Norway have opened a corruption investigation into the country's former Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland over his alleged links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. A special Norwegian police unit which is analysing newly released Epstein files in the US said the 75-year-old was suspected of \"aggravated corruption\". Police said they had already asked the country's foreign ministry to lift his immunity, which he enjoys because of his past role as a senior foreign diplomat. Jagland is also a former head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee and spent 10 years as secretary general of the Council of Europe. His lawyer said they would fully co-operate with the investigation.Pål K. Lønseth, head of Økokrim - the economic crime unit investigating Jagland - said: \"We consider there are reasonable grounds for investigation, given that he held the positions of chair of the Nobel Committee and Secretary General of the Council of Europe during the period covered by the released documents.\"Among other things, Økokrim will investigate whether gifts, travel and loans were received in connection with his position.\"The police added that further details would be given \"at a later stage\".Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said it was \"important that the facts of this case are brought to light\".He added that Oslo would ask the Council of Europe for Jagland's immunity to be revoked.Jagland's lawyer Anders Brosveet welcomed the opening of the investigation.\"Based on what we have found so far, we are confident of the outcome,\" he told Reuters news agency. Separately, Brosveet told Norway's VG news site that he and his client would submit \"the key findings and documentation we have to Økokrim as soon as practically possible\".Jagland was Norway's prime minister in 1996-97, and the secretary general of the Council of Europe in 2009-19.He also chaired the Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2009-15.",

Police officials say a suicide bomber detonated a device after approaching the gates of the Shia mosque in the Tarlai area of the city, while eyewitnesses have told the BBC the blast was preceded by the sound of gunfire.An emergency was declared as hospitals began to receive the wounded, with an appeal sent out for blood donations.Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has condemned the incident, expressing \"deep grief\".In a statement released on social media, he called for a thorough investigation and the immediate identification of those behind the attack.Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari said in his own statement that \"targeting innocent civilians is a crime against humanity\".'We bowed - then there was an explosion'AFP via Getty ImagesAlmost 170 were injured in the explosion, with an appeal for blood donors being issuedZaheer Abbas was inside the Khadijatul Kubra Mosque praying when he first heard the sound of bullets.\"After that, we bowed and then prostrated, and then there was an explosion,\" he told BBC Urdu. \"After which there were injured people lying everywhere.\"Pictures from the mosque in the aftermath show footwear scattered across the floor, shattered glass, and people sat among the wreckage.Abbas, who said he \"lost his senses\" in the moments after the explosion, was eventually pulled out by emergency services and taken to hospital, where he was quickly released.\"Fortunately, I did not suffer much injury,\" he said.The mosque's caretaker Syed Ashfaq - who lives next door - also heard gunfire, and began running towards the mosque to help.\"By the time I reached it there had already been an explosion,\" he told the BBC. \"Bodies were lying everywhere, some were missing arms, some missing legs. We took the most injured in our own vehicle [to hospital].\"Islamabad's deputy commissioner Irfan Memon said on X that the death toll stood at 31, with the injured numbering 169.Pictures from local hospitals show the injured being brought by private vehicles and ambulances, with one photographer for news agency AFP saying they saw dozens of people arriving at hospital.Attacks are relatively rare in the capital, although one in November left 12 dead. Another 27 were injured in the blast, outside a courthouse.The blast on Friday comes after a week of violence which saw 58 civilians killed in coordinated attacks in the province of Balochistan. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) rebel group said it was behind the attacks. The military - which has been fighting an insurgency in the region for decades - said it had killed more than 200 militants in response.Last year was also Pakistan's deadliest in over a decade as combat-related deaths surged 74%, with militants accounting for more than half the death toll, according to a new report released by an independent think tank.The Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) said violence in Pakistan left 3,413 people dead - up from 1,950 in 2024 - with 2,138 militants killed.Additional reporting Caroline Davies",

    "body": "3 hours agoOlivia IrelandWatch: What's happened since Savannah Guthrie's mother disappeared?The brother of US news presenter Savannah Guthrie has renewed his family's plea for proof that their mother is still alive after she disappeared last weekend.As the first deadline from an alleged ransom letter passed, Camron Guthrie said in a video posted to Instagram that the family had not heard anything about their missing mother, Nancy Guthrie.The 84-year-old is believed to have been abducted from her home in Tucson, Arizona in the middle of the night. Police launched a massive hunt, with officials offering a reward of $50,000 (£36,000) for information that leads to an arrest.\"We have to know that you have our mum,\" Camron said in the latest video message. \"We want to talk to you.\"\"We haven't heard anything directly,\" he said in the video, posted on Thursday just after 17:00 local time in Arizona (00:00 GMT).\"We need you to reach out, and we need a way to communicate with you so we can move forward.\"It came as the first supposed deadline for the Guthrie family to hand over money passed. At a briefing on Thursday, FBI Special Agent Heith Janke said his agency was reviewing an alleged ransom note. It gave a deadline for payment of 17:00 on Thursday, he said, without specifying which time zone, and had a second deadline for Monday.No further information was shared about what was threatened if the deadline was not met. \"We're not going to go into specifics,\" Janke said.It was announced the same day that authorities had made an arrest over a fake ransom note. Earlier in the week, Savannah Guthrie shared an emotional video message, along with her siblings. The host of NBC News' Today programme addressed the potential abductor or abductors directly, saying: \"We are ready to talk... We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and you have her... Please, reach out to us\".The case has garnered nationwide attention, with dozens of reporters and camera crews descending on the quiet Arizona suburb where Nancy lives.Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said on Thursday investigators were no closer to finding out who was responsible - but that they were working on the assumption she was still alive.\"Right now, we believe Nancy is still out there. We want her home,\" he said. \"Everybody's still a suspect in our eyes.\" Authorities have urged the public to call the sheriff's office with any information, vowing to look into all leads, and discouraging the spread of misinformation.",

    "body": "Coin portrait of late Queen draws criticism in Australia 5 hours agoKathryn ArmstrongRoyal Australian Mint$5 and 50 cent versions of the coin have been released to mark the centenary of Queen Elizabeth II's birthTwo commemorative coins, released by the Royal Australian Mint and bearing a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, have been criticised for their lack of resemblance to the late monarch.The $5 (£2.56) and 50 cent silver coins, created to commemorate the centenary of the Queen's birth, were released in an online ballot that closed on Wednesday.\"That's got to be the most unpleasant portrait on a coin,\" said one of several people who reacted negatively online. The Royal Australian Mint defended the portrait, saying: \"Our coin images don't always capture the full beauty of a design once it's etched in metal.\"Queen Elizabeth II died in 2022 at the age of 96 and was the UK's longest serving monarch. \"There's a reason most portraits are from the side. Looks like she just ran into a wall,\" one person commented underneath a Facebook post from the mint.\"If I saw that face without the hairdo and pearls, would never guess who it was meant to be,\" another said.Comparisons have been made with various TV characters, including Mrs Doubtfire - the beloved fictional housekeeper in the comedy film of the same name, played by the late Robin Williams.Royal Australian MintOther people were more positive about the design, which was created by one of the mint's artists. \"Awesome. I'm glad they put something out to do with Queen Elizabeth II, she deserves to have Recognition In a Special Way,\" one user wrote on social media.\"Please pick me for one of these coins,\" said another. One woman living in the US commented that it \"looks like a beautiful coin\". Despite the criticism, collectors reported that the ballot was fully subscribed. Australian media, quoting a spokesperson for the Royal Australian Mint, said the silver proof coins had sold out, and there were limited stocks left in their contact centre and shop.According to the mint's website, it created 30,000 of the 50c coins and 5,000 of the $5 - all of which are collector's items and will not enter general public circulation.As well as the queen's portrait, the coins feature designs \"symbolically reflecting the many facets of Queen Elizabeth II's life and legacy\", the mint said. These include motifs of a horse and corgi, references to art and theatre to mark \"her enduring support for culture\", as well as some of her favourite flowers - roses and lily of the valley. The golden wattle, Australia's national floral emblem, is also represented. \"The design incorporates Her Majesty's Royal Cypher, a stylised St Edward's Crown and the Auxiliary Territorial Service emblem, acknowledging her wartime service and lifelong sense of duty,\" the mint added.Meanwhile, the backs of the coins feature a portrait of the Queen's son, King Charles, in profile.

    "body": "5 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorWatch: BBC on the scene of Russian general shooting in MoscowA high-profile general in Russia's military has been shot several times and wounded in Moscow.Lt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev was immediately taken to hospital after the attack in a residential block of flats on the north-western outskirts of the Russian capital and his condition is unknown.Alexeyev is number two in the main directorate of Russia's GRU military intelligence  and the latest high-ranking military figure to have been targeted in the capital since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began almost four years ago.He was placed under European Union and UK sanctions after the GRU was accused of being behind the 2018 nerve agent attack in Salisbury in the UK.\"The victim has been hospitalised at one of the city's hospitals,\" said Svetlana Petrenko of Russia's Investigations Committee, which said it opened a criminal case for attempted murder.The gunman fled and investigators searched CCTV footage for clues and began interviewing witnesses.Russian Defence MinistryLt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev is number two in the main directorate of Russia's GRU military intelligenceA neighbour of Alexeyev told the Reuters news agency she had been woken up by the sound of \"several\" shots and had then heard another neighbour screaming for help.  \"This is all I heard. Other neighbours rushed out, too. They asked how they could help, should they call ambulance and police, but she had already called them.\"Alexeyev has played a significant role during the war in Ukraine, taking part in talks with Ukraine during the Russian siege of the city of Mariupol in 2022. He was also sent to negotiate with the head of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who led a short and bloody mutiny in June 2023.His boss at the GRU, Igor Kostyukov, has been in charge of Russia's negotiating team taking part in talks on security issues with the US and Ukraine in Abu Dhabi.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin was being briefed on the shooting. \"We wish first of all that the general survives and recovers. We hope that will be the case,\" he told reporters.It is not yet known who was behind the shooting on Friday morning in a residential block on Volokolamsk Highway in Moscow but Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused Ukraine. Kyiv has not commented but has claimed some attacks on Russian military figures in the past. Russian intelligence officials claimed they had thwarted an attempted attack on a Russian soldier in St Petersburg at the end of last month.An Uzbek man was jailed in January for the 2024 killing of another general, Igor Kirillov, in an explosion outside a block of flats in Moscow. Sources in Ukraine's SBU intelligence said at the time it was behind the attack.Lt Gen Kirillov had been in charge of Russia's Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection troops.In December 2025, another high-ranking officer in the GRU, Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, was killed when an explosive device detonated under a car in Moscow. He was in charge of the armed force's operational training department, according to Russia's Investigative Committee.",

    "body": "3 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterGetty ImagesThe EU has told TikTok it must change its \"addictive design\" or face heavy fines, after it found the video sharing platform had breached its online safety rules.It follows an investigation which began in February 2024 into the Chinese-owned app by the European Commission.In its preliminary findings, the Commission said TikTok did not \"adequately assess\" how features like autoplay could harm the wellbeing of its users, including children, and said it failed to implement measures to mitigate the risks.A TikTok spokesperson told the BBC the findings presented a \"categorically false and entirely meritless depiction of our platform\" and it planned to challenge them.The platform has been invited to respond to the EU's findings. Depending on the outcome of this step, the Commission could fine TikTok up to 6% of its total global annual turnover - estimated to be in the tens of billions.EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen told reporters if TikTok wanted to avoid being fined, it would have to \"change the design of their service in Europe\".The Commission gave several suggestions for actions the platform could take, including implementing \"screen time breaks\" when people are using it at night and changing its algorithms, which feed users personalised content.It also suggested TikTok disable so-called \"infinite scroll\", which allows people to quickly cycle through millions of videos on the platform.\"The Digital Services Act makes platforms responsible for the effects they can have on their users,\" Virkkunen said.\"In Europe, we enforce our legislation to protect our children and our citizens online.\"Professor Sonia Livingstone at the London School of Economics said while TikTok had introduced some tools to improve the online safety of its users, it was not enough to comply with the guidelines set down by the EU.\"Young people are calling for such changes,\" she said. \"They are frustrated that the platform does not prioritise their wellbeing over profit.\"And social media expert Matt Navarra said while the use of the word addictive was \"often abused\" in these debates, the Commission's findings seemed to be rooted in \"true behavioural science\".He added it marked a \"seismic shift\" in the way in which regulators were looking at social media platforms.\"This seems to be the first time a major regulator has said that the design is the problem,\" he said.\"It's no longer about just toxic content, it's about toxic design.\"'Warning shot'It is not the first time the EU has looked into the workings of big tech firms or threatened them with fines.In December 2024 it began a separate investigation into TikTok over alleged foreign interference during the Romanian presidential elections.It has also launched an inquiry in January into Elon Musk's X over concerns its AI tool Grok was used to create sexualised images of real people.Meanwhile in December 2025 the EU fined X €120m (£105m) over its blue tick badges, saying they \"deceive users\" because the firm is not \"meaningfully verifying\" who is behind the account.Social media analyst Paolo Pescatore said the latest announcement was a \"reality check\" for TikTok - and a \"warning shot\" for every social media platform.\"The market is shifting from 'maximise engagement' to 'engineer responsibility' - and regulators now have the tools to enforce it,\" he said.",

Louvre MuseumOne of the crown's golden eagles is missing but all the emeralds and most of the diamonds remainTwo of the thieves got inside by cutting through the window with power tools. They then threatened the guards, who evacuated the area, and cut through the glass of two display cases housing jewellery that once belonged to French royalty or its imperial rulers.Prosecutors said the thieves were inside for less than four minutes before making their escape on two scooters waiting outside.Police have arrested four male suspects who prosecutors allege are the thieves - but the mastermind behind the raid has not been tracked down. The seven other items of jewellery taken, including a diamond-studded tiara that belonged to Eugenie and necklaces, ear-rings and brooches remain missing.ReutersThe undamaged crown of French Empress Eugenie - seen here in a photograph from 2025",

    "body": "3 hours agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterGetty ImagesJeweller Pandora has said it will switch from using silver in some of its ranges to platinum-plating following a dramatic increase in prices.Silver prices have more than doubled over the past year with other precious metals such as gold also surging. Pandora's chief executive Berta de Pablos-Barbier said the aim was not to make all jewellery platinum-plated, but silver will be reduced to around 20% of its goods to lessen its exposure to the metal given the recent volatility.The Danish firm, one of the world's biggest jewellery retailers, currently makes the majority of its products from silver.Pandora is well-known for its charm bracelets.Chief executive de Pablos-Barbier said that around 60% of its business was currently in silver. Although platinum is more expensive than silver per ounce, Pandora said it will plate platinum over an alloy, which would make it cheaper to use. It added that the end product would not cost the consumer any more or less than its silver pieces.Jewellery historian Vivienne Becker said: \"Platinum has obviously got an elitist image, so people will still get that feeling of preciousness,\" she said, even if it is based on an alloy.She added that there had been a shift by consumers towards white metals after gold prices have risen, and the announcement by Pandora was \"clever marketing\" that would appeal to the \"upmarket\" consumer.Pandora said: \"Our insights show that platinum is highly regarded by consumers and perceived as the second most precious white metal after white solid gold.\"It said it will introduce \"a curated selection\" of its \"best-selling bracelets in a platinum-plated version\" across 30 stores and online in northern Europe, before a global rollout in the second half of 2026. It added in the short-term it would use third parties to plate its platinum jewellery, before moving to its sites in Thailand and Vietnam. It wants the pivot to platinum plating to be completed by 2028.De Pablos-Barbier told CNBC: \"If you look at our volatility of silver, one of the things that we have to [do] for the company is to decouple that from the silver trading.\"Silver prices hit record highs of over $100 per ounce in January before falling back to around $75, but remains elevated compared with last year.The firm said that the surging price had a \"temporary impact on earnings\".Getty ImagesPandora's charm bracelets are one of its most well-known itemsPrecious metals such as gold and silver have rallied recently as investors sought so-called \"safe haven\" assets during global geopolitical uncertainty and economic volatility.\"Silver is tied to global economic health,\" said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell.It is used in the manufacture of electronics and medical equipment, solar panels and batteries which means demand for the metal from industry \"ebbs and flows according to how fast the world's economy is growing.\"",

    "body": "9 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporterGetty ImagesPrior to the opening of the Canadian consulate, only Iceland and the United States had a full diplomatic presence in Greenland. Canada is set to open its first diplomatic outpost in Greenland in a significant show of solidarity following US President Donald Trump's threats to take control of the territory. A delegation of senior Canadian officials, including Governor General Mary Simon, and foreign minister Anita Anand, are travelling to Nuuk on Friday to formally open Canada's consulate, accompanied by a Canadian Coast Guard ship.Ahead of the trip, Simon said in a speech that Canada \"stands firmly in support of the people of Greenland who will determine their own future\".Their visit comes amid a similar trip made by French officials, who are due to open their own consulate in the territory the same day.The Canadian and French missions are a historic expansion of foreign engagement in Greenland. Until this week, only Iceland and the US offered formal consular services in Nuuk.It is also a signal of the continued support offered by Nato allies to Greenland, after Trump repeatedly stated that the US needs to \"own\" it for national security reasons. The president has since walked his comments back, saying he is now exploring a potential deal after talks with Denmark, European allies and Canada.Greenland has been on Canada's radar for some time. The consulate was first announced in early 2024, when Ottawa reviewed its Arctic foreign policy. The opening had been slated for late 2025, but that was delayed due to bad weather.Getty ImagesGovernor General Mary Simon (right) is part of the delegation travelling to Nuuk. She is Canada's Crown representativeNow, the consulate carries even more weight, said Michael Byers, a professor at the University of British Columbia who has authored several books on the Arctic.\"I'm only surprised it hasn't occurred sooner, given the important connections between Greenland and Arctic Canada,\" he added.He noted that Iqaluit, the capital of Canada's northern territory of Nunavut, is only an hour flight away from Nuuk. Inuit in Canada also share a strong bond with Greenlandic Inuit – a bond underscored by Governor General Simon's own Inuk roots.\"Her visit is an affirmation at the highest level of the cultural and ethnic connections between Arctic Canada and Greenland,\" Byers said. \"It's a very powerful statement.\"Simon, who grew up in Nunavik in northern Quebec, is the first Canadian governor general to visit Greenland since 1982. But her exposure to the Arctic territory began decades ago, she said, when she would hear Greenlandic Inuit songs as a child through her grandmother's shortwave radio.\"She would say: 'These are our relatives who live in faraway lands. We are all one people,'\" Simon recalled at the annual Arctic Frontiers conference this week in Norway, shortly before her trip to Nuuk.Natan Obed, president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, which represents Canadian Inuit, told the BBC that the consulate is the result of years of advocacy by his community to forge closer ties.Obed said that around 50 Canadian Inuit will be arriving on a chartered plane from Montreal to Nuuk to attend Friday's ceremony.Inuit in Canada, he said, feel the US threats against Greenland intimately due to their shared history of colonisation, as well as Trump's own comments about Canada.\"We do worry that the United States may return to its more serious overtures around annexing Canada and Canada being the 51st state, and we do worry that Inuit Nunangat, our homeland, is one of the pivotal reasons for the US to consider that sentiment,\" Obed said.Getty ImagesGreenlanders have strongly opposed Donald Trump's proposal of seizing the semi-autonomous Arctic island, as have other Nato allies like France and Canada.Trump has justified a US takeover of Greenland by blaming Denmark for failing to adequately protect the island from Russian or Chinese threats. The Arctic has been flagged as a vulnerability by successive Canadian governments, and Obed acknowledged that infrastructure there, like highways and electricity connections, remains limited, to the detriment of both national security and those who call the northern regions home.Prime Minister Mark Carney's government has promised a year-round military presence in the Arctic and pledged more than C$1bn ($730m; £540m) for northern infrastructure projects that would be used by both civilians and the military.Foreign minister Anand has called Arctic defence \"an unquestionable national security priority of this government\".\"It is not a secondary concern, it is not a regional issue, but central to how we protect Canada in our front yard and how we contribute to global security,\" she said at a Nordic-Canadian Arctic Symposium last week.Along with the opening of the Canadian consulate, Governor General Simon will also be meeting with Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, while Anand will meet with her counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt.",

    "body": "2 hours agoWycliffe MuiaGetty ImagesZambian rivers have some of the highest concentrations of crocodiles in Africa (file photo)A 52-year-old fisherman has died after being attacked by a crocodile while fleeing a herd of elephants in eastern Zambia, police say. Dean Nyirenda was returning from a fishing trip with two friends on Wednesday when they bumped into the elephants. They ran away, with Nyirenda diving into a stream near the Luangwa River.\"That is when he was attacked by a crocodile by biting his right thigh,\" local police chief Robertson Mweemba told journalists. The southern African country has a thriving elephant population and clashes between humans and wildlife have claimed many lives in recent years.Police said Nyirenda had managed to escape the crocodile by hitting it with a stick which he had in his hands.\"He dragged himself from the stream,\" said MweembaHis two fellow fishermen, who had been watching from a distance, went to help him and carried him from the riverbank while he was bleeding heavily, state-run ZNBC news website reported.  \"They tried to stop the bleeding but unfortunately he died,\" added the police chief. Wildlife officers later visited the scene and found deep bite marks on the fisherman's right thigh, which had led to the fatal bleeding.The BBC has reached out to the authorities for comment.The Luangwa River, which flows through Zambia's South Luangwa National Park, is home to one of the highest concentrations of Nile crocodiles in Africa, according to conservationists. Of the 26 wildlife-related deaths recorded in 2023, 15 were caused by crocodile attacks, most of them along the Luangwa River, according to Resource Africa, a community-led conservation NGO.Zambian authorities have previously called on locals and tourists to exercise extreme caution when travelling through the country's wildlife hotspots.Wildlife authorities say they have been considering measures to reduce the human-animal conflicts, including building protective fences near wildlife areas.You may also be interested in: Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "13 hours agoKelly NgandShaimaa Khalil,Tokyo correspondentReutersTakaichi has \"already proven to be a strong, powerful, and wise leader,\" Trump says in throwing his weight behind herDonald Trump has endorsed Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi ahead of a snap election in her country on Sunday. Takaichi has \"already proven to be a strong, powerful, and wise leader... one that truly loves her country,\" the US president wrote in a Truth Social post on Thursday, adding: \"She will not let the people of Japan down!\"While it is rare for US presidents to publicly back candidates in foreign elections, Trump has done so before, endorsing Argentina's Javier Milei and Hungary's Viktor Orban most recently.  Takaichi has courted the US president as Tokyo seeks more stability in its relationship with Washington, its closest ally, in the wake of Trump's tariffs. Trump had threatened a 25% tariff initially, but Japan then struck a deal in July  to invest $550bn (£407bn) in the US. In exchange, Washington lowered import levies to 15%. Takaichi, 64, became PM in October after she won the leadership race in her party and secured enough support in parliament. But she has called an election to seek a public mandate. Just one week after she took office, Tokyo rolled out the red carpet for Trump, deploying a full military guard of honour and band to welcome him at the Akasaka Palace, the government's state guesthouse.It was her diplomatic debut, and the optics were striking: Takaichi aboard the aircraft carrier USS George Washington, fists pumping as the US president praised her in front of thousands of US soldiers, the images then broadcast around the world.She sought to portray herself as a leader Trump can and wants to do business with and, perhaps more importantly for the president, someone he gets along with personally.The two leaders also see eye-to-eye on defence. Trump wants Tokyo to spend more on its own security and so does Takaichi, as sentiment grows in Japan that it must invest more in defence. They heaped compliments on each other during the visit and signed a deal on rare earths, as well as a document heralding a new \"golden age\" of US-Japan relations. Takaichi described Trump as a \"partner in a new golden era\", and praised his role in bringing peace to the Middle East. \"In my visit to Japan, I and all of my representatives, were extremely impressed with her,\" Trump wrote in his Truth Social post on Thursday, noting that the two countries have made progress in national security cooperation and on the economic front.Trump also said he would welcome Takaichi to the White House on 19 March. Getty Images'My goal is to become the Iron Lady,' Takaichi saysHis post, which signals that Takaichi is a leader his administration would work with, is a message aimed not only at Japanese voters but also the region, and especially China. Beijing and Tokyo are in the middle of  a diplomatic rift, and the historically tense relationship has hit its lowest point in more than a decade.Takaichi found herself the target of China's ire in November, when she made comments suggesting that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan, the self-governed island it has long claimed. She has since refused to retract the statement.Trump's endorsement of her comes as tensions between them continue, and a day after he had a phone call with China's leader Xi Jinping. Xi called Taiwan \"the most important issue\" in their relationship, emphasising that Taiwan was \"China's territory\", Chinese state media reported. He also told Trump that Washington should be \"prudent\" when supplying weapons to the self-governed island which China has long claimed.Polls so far are predicting a landslide for Takaichi but winning Sunday's election will just be the first of several hurdles. Her leadership will be defined by how she manages Japan's stagnant economy and the delicate relationship with the US, its most critical security ally, as well as China, its largest trading partner.",

    "body": "1 hour agoKali HaysTechnology reporterReutersAmazon has announced plans to invest $200bn (£147.7bn) in artificial intelligence (AI) and infrastructure, becoming the latest US tech giant to set out a sharp rise in spending.It dwarfs the $125bn Amazon spent on AI last year, and appeared to rattle investors. Shares were down nearly 9% in morning trade on Friday, after the company revealed its plans.This week Big Tech's major players - Amazon, Meta, Google, and Microsoft - collectively announced they will this year plough $650bn into AI and related projects However, some high profile names in finance and technology have warned that AI is at risk of becoming a bubble which could burst.As Amazon, which was founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, set out its full-year results on Thursday, it said it will invest in \"AI, chips, robotics and low earth orbit satellites\". Amazon's chief executive, Andy Jassy, was clear on a call with financial analysts that the bulk of its spending will go towards AI. \"It's an unusual opportunity,\" Jassy said of AI, suggesting it will become profitable in the future.\"I passionately believe every customer experience we have today will be reinvented by AI. We're going to invest aggressively,\" Jassy added.However, investors are concerned about the scale of spending on AI and when companies will start to see a return. Like Amazon, the likes of Meta and Microsoft also saw their share prices fall this week, dragging down the wider market.Mary Therese Barton, chief investment officer at Pictet Asset Management, told the BBC there were \"certainly jitters\".She said: \"It has definitely been a bit of a rupture and a bit of a wake up call as well, in terms of 'are these investments in AI going to come good?'.\"The boss of US tech giant Cisco told the BBC that the transition to AI will create winners, but warned there will be \"carnage along the way\". Chuck Robbins said the technology will be \"bigger than the internet\", but the current market is probably a bubble and some companies \"won't make it\".And Jamie Dimon, boss of one of America's biggest banks, JPMorgan Chase, said some of the money invested in AI would \"probably be lost\".Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, noted that the company was looking at cost reductions elsewhere as it ramps up spending.Leaders of other companies joining the AI rush have struck a similar tone.Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg said in January the company will spend up to $135bn this year, nearly double last year's amount.The Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp owner is working on training its AI models, building out data centres and buying the computer chips that are required to operate AI tools.But Zuckerberg also pointed to the use of AI by technical workers, saying that fewer people are now needed on big projects.He predicted \"2026 to be the year that AI dramatically changes the way we work.\"Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said his firm will invest even more than Meta on AI, more than doubling its capital expenditure to $185bn this year. The company is expanding its technical infrastructure related to AI, including servers and data centres.While Microsoft did not say exactly how much it will spend over the year, it has so far spent over $72bn on recruiting talent and infrastructure related to AI, while executives have made no mention of pulling back spending.The S&P 500 stock index, which hit an all-time high at the end of January, fell by more than 1% on Thursday, its third day in a row of losses. The index was up almost 1% in morning trade on Friday.",

    "body": "1 hour agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondentAFP via Getty ImagesThe US negotiators will be led by special envoy Steve Witkoff (left), while the Iranian team is headed by Foreign Minister Abbas AraghchiSenior US and Iranian officials have held talks in Oman amid a crisis that has raised fears of a military confrontation between the two countries.The indirect discussions in the capital Muscat happened as the US military builds up its presence in the Middle East in response to Iran's violent repression of nationwide anti-government protests last month, which human rights groups say killed many thousands of people.Speaking on state television after the talks, Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi said negotiators would return to their capitals for consultations, but described the meeting as a \"good beginning\".Iran had previously said the talks would be limited to its nuclear programme. The US, which is demanding Iran freezes its nuclear programme and discards its stockpile of enriched uranium, had said they should also involve Iran's ballistic missiles and the country's support for regional armed groups.Earlier, Oman said its foreign minister had held separate talks with Araghchi, and US special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Trump's son-in-law and emissary Jared Kushner.It said the \"consultations focused on preparing the appropriate conditions for resuming diplomatic and technical negotiations\". The last round of talks between the US and Iran over the Iranian nuclear programme had been scheduled for last June but collapsed after Israel's surprise attack on Iran.In recent weeks, Trump has threatened to bomb Iran if it does not reach a deal. The US has sent thousands of troops and what Trump has described as an \"armada\" to the region, including an aircraft carrier along with other warships as well as fighter jets.Iran has vowed to respond to an attack with force, threatening to strike American military assets in the Middle East and Israel.For Iran's embattled leaders, the talks could be the last chance to avert US military action that could further destabilise the regime, which analysts say is in its weakest position since it came to power following the 1979 Islamic Revolution.Trump's threats came as Iran's security forces brutally repressed large-scale demonstrations, which were triggered by a deepening economic crisis, and saw protesters calling for the end of the Islamic Republic.The Human Rights Activists News Agency, a Washington-based group, said it had confirmed at least 6,883 deaths, warning that the number could be much higher, and that more than 50,000 people had been arrested.The current crisis has brought back to discussions the issue of Iran's nuclear programme, which has been at the centre of a long-running dispute with the West.For decades, Iran has said its programme is for peaceful purposes, while the US and Israel have accused it of being part of an effort to develop a weapon.Iran says it has the right to enrich uranium in its own territory and has rejected calls for its stockpile of highly enriched uranium - 400kg (880lb) - to be transferred to a third country. The country says its uranium enrichment activity stopped after the US attacks last year.Officials have indicated being open to concessions, which could include the creation of a regional consortium for uranium enrichment, as proposed during talks with the US that collapsed when Israel launched its surprise war last year.At the same time, Iran says demands to limit the country's ballistic missile programme and to end the support for proxies in the region - an alliance Tehran calls the \"Axis of Resistance\" that includes Hamas in Gaza, militias in Iraq, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen - are unacceptable and a breach of its sovereignty.On Tuesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said he had instructed Araghchi to \"pursue fair and equitable negotiations\" with the US, \"provided that a suitable environment exists\".For the US, the meeting, depending on its outcome, could offer an off-ramp for Trump from his military threats.Regional countries are concerned that a US strike could lead to a wider conflict or long-term chaos in Iran, and have warned that air power alone will not be able to topple the Iranian leadership.Asked if Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei should be worried, Trump told NBC News on Wednesday: \"I would say he should be very worried. Yeah, he should be\".Watch: Iran's supreme leader 'should be very worried' amid tensions, Trump saysUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the discussions would have to go beyond the nuclear issue for \"something meaningful\" to be achieved.\"I'm not sure you can reach a deal with these guys, but we're going to try to find out. We don't see there's any harm in trying to figure out if there's something that can be done,\" he said.The talks, initially planned to be held in Istanbul, are an effort led by Egypt, Turkey and Qatar to defuse tensions.Iran, however, asked at the last minute for the location of the meeting to be changed to Oman, which hosted discussions last year, and for it to be limited to Iranian and American officials.",

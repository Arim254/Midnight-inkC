    "body": "2 days agoChiamaka DikeBBC Africa, Makoko, LagosGift Ufuoma/BBCA mother of five, Anna Sobie's wooden home is one of many that has been demolished in a shanty town in a lagoon in Lagos, with critics describing it as a \"land-grab\" by the authorities to gentrify the prime waterfront spot in Nigeria's biggest city.Lagos State government officials deny the allegation, saying they are demolishing parts of Makoko - the country's biggest informal waterfront settlement - because it is expanding near high voltage power lines, posing a major health and safety risk.Sobie and her children now sleep on the narrow broken platform where their house stood until a few weeks ago on Lagos Lagoon. This is the biggest of 10 lagoons in a mega-city that is facing an acute housing crisis - and where life is becoming increasingly expensive, pushing more people to the margins of society. As Sobie spoke to the BBC, canoes - steered with paddles or long bamboo poles - moved through the narrow waterways, carrying mattresses and sacks of clothes belonging to the displaced people.Residents say the demolitions began two days before Christmas, when excavation teams accompanied by armed police moved into sections of the waterfront settlement facing the Atlantic Ocean.In a joint statement last month, 10 non-governmental organisations said that \"armed thugs, security personnel and demolition teams with bulldozers descended repeatedly on the community\" to tear down homes, and burn them.\"Homes were set on fire with little or no notice, in some cases while residents were still [inside],\" the NGOs added.Gift Ufuoma/BBCAnna Sobie's family are living on the the ruins of their houseWhen the BBC visited Makoko, smoke, from the rubble of torched homes or from fires that people had lit, burning damp wood to dry their clothes, was hanging in the air.Excavators were at work along the shoreline - houses built on wooden stilts over the lagoon were still being pulled down, their planks collapsing into the water below.  Corrugated metal sheets were falling from roofs and drifting between boats. Makoko was founded in the 19th Century by fishing communities who have lived in the settlement ever since, along with other low-income families and migrants who come to Lagos in search of better opportunities. Ownership of the lagoon is fiercely contested. The state government claims ownership of it under federal law, saying Makoko has been built without planning permission or occupancy rights. Older residents dispute this, saying the settlement predates modern Lagos, and they have what they call a customary right to it.Estimates of Makoko's population vary, from 80,000 to 200,000, but much of the settlement now lies in fragments.The NGOs said that more than 10,000 people have been displaced after the destruction of more than 3,000 homes, as well as schools, clinics and churches. The state government has not given any figures of the buildings demolished.Sobie's home was among those that have been destroyed. \"I was inside when it started,\" she says. \"The noise was very loud. When we came out, we saw the excavator.\"She says there was little time to move her family's belongings. Her son Solomon's school in Makoko was demolished the same day. Sobie's family moved briefly into a building nearby. That, too, was later pulled down. \"We're sleeping in an open space under the rain, and they're currently setting properties ablaze,\" Sobie says, adding:  \"We don't have another place.\" Like many other children, Solomon no longer goes to school. He now helps his mother gather firewood from collapsed houses, pulling loose planks from the debris to sell.Even as the excavators work, canoe-borne business activities continue, with traders peddling their way through the remaining homes to sell fish and goods. But many other traders can no longer do business, as they lost their goods when their homes were demolished or torched.With the lagoon central to their lives, they have protested against the move to force them out of Makoko. Gift Ufuoma/BBCThe state government says it will give financial compensation to families whose homes have been destroyedMore than 1,000 angry residents marched last week to the state legislature, the House of Assembly, demanding an audience with Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, whose offices are nearby.But police responded by firing tear gas, with protesters saying that at least one person was injured in the ensuing chaos.Community leaders and residents say that tear gas was also fired during the demolitions a few weeks ago, causing the death of five people, including children. \"Children were weeping, some died, some were unconscious, and were taken to the hospital as a result of the tear gas,\" Sobie tells the BBC.The Lagos State government says it is unaware of their personnel using tear gas or of deaths linked to the demolitions. Speaking to the BBC, the state's commissioner for information, Gbenga Omotoso, says that any such claims would be investigated.\"We would determine the actual cause of death,\" he says. \"Our personnel will not knowingly kill anybody.\"The state government has defended the demolitions, saying they are targeting homes built beneath high voltage power lines.\"No responsible government anywhere in the world can allow people to live directly under high-tension cables or obstruct vital waterways,\" the governor's special adviser on urban development, Olajide Abiodun Babatunde, said in a statement. Governor Sanwo-Olu said that affected families would be provided with financial grants and other assistance, and it was wrong to accuse him of \"destroying\" Makoko. He raised concern that shanties were \"sprawling\" at an \"incredible speed\", getting closer to the Third Mainland Bridge, the longest and busiest of three bridges connecting the mainland to the islands - the commercial heart of the city and its wealthier neighbourhoods.For the governor this spells danger.\"So, what we have done is that we just pushed them back,\" he added.Gift Ufuoma/BBCSome residents suspect their homes have been demolished to pave the way for an upmarket development Lagos-based real estate developer Peacemaker Afolabi tells the BBC that demand for land in the city is huge.\"Everywhere in Lagos is prime land,\" he says. \"And waterfront is always prime.\" Some residents suspect that the demolitions are aimed at clearing the area for private developments, including luxury homes.This has been repeatedly denied by the state government, but suspicion remains.\"This is not the slow, decades-long gentrification often seen in Western cities. It's a rapid, almost violent reshaping that is already forcing millions of residents to the margins,\" he writes. \"In the next few years, Lagos may look more polished and globally appealing. But for many of its people, it will also become profoundly unliveable.\"In their joint statement, the NGOs said that demolitions in Makoko, and other settlements last year, were part of a \"sinister agenda to grab land\". \"These actions against thousands of peaceful, hardworking residents represent a deliberate pattern of state-enabled violence against the urban poor, carried out to clear valuable land for elite interests and private mega-developments,\" the NGOs said. \"The housing deficit has thus grown from approximately 2.95 million units in 2016 to 3.4 million in 2025, a 15 per cent increase,\" Nigeria's Punch newspaper quoted the report as saying.Rapid population growth, rising rents and limited access to formal housing have pushed many low-income residents into informal settlements, particularly along waterfronts and transport corridors.The authorities have demolished homes in Makoko in the past - most recently in 2017, when residents obtained a court order to prevent forced evictions without adequate notice, compensation and resettlement.Megan Chapman, co-director of the Justice and Empowerment Initiatives campaign group, says the government has failed to provide residents affected by the latest demolitions with alternative accommodation. \"They have to identify everyone who will be affected and make arrangements before homes are lost,\" she tells the BBC\"When people are removed like this, it affects livelihoods, family structures and how communities function over time.\"When the BBC was in Makoko, boys were sitting along the lagoon, repairing their broken fishing nets. Children moved between piles of debris, collecting firewood from collapsed structures. A tractor pulled away from what was once a house. Only a small number of buildings remained standing, including the homes of traditional leaders.Elizabeth Kakisiwe says she sleeps nearby.Each evening, she lays wooden boards on damp ground for her children and packs them away again in the morning.\"We were at the market when it started,\" she says. \"When I came back, my house was gone.\"She says there was no clear warning and no time to remove belongings. Clothes, cooking utensils and mattresses were lost. When rain fell days later, they were drenched.\"At night, we sit in the cold,\" she says. \"If the children feel sick, we give them paracetamol.\"Cooking has become difficult, she says, because rain has made the ground wet and rats move through the debris. \"Yesterday, we only drank garri,\" Kakisiwe says, referring to a popular cassava-based meal that is often made as a drink. \"There is nothing to cook.\"Expressing a similar view, Sobie says: \"The suffering is much. A lot of people have been dying. We just don't know what to say. It's only God that can help us.\"Additional reporting by Gift UfuomaMore BBC stories about housing in Lagos:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "9 hours agoKoh EweX/Liu HuLiu Hu, a prominent investigative reporter in China, was previously arrested in 2013 on suspicion of defamationRights groups and activists are sounding the alarm about the detention of two Chinese investigative journalists after they reportedly exposed corruption by a senior official in Sichuan province.Independent journalists Liu Hu and Wu Yingjiao were taken by police on Sunday after they published their investigation, rights groups say.Critics have long flagged concern about media repression in China, where authorities have arrested and prosecuted journalists, accusing them of causing trouble.Chengdu police said on Monday that two men, identified by their surnames Liu and Wu and aged 50 and 34, were under investigation for \"making false accusations\" and \"illegal business operations\".In response a question about the arrests, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters on Wednesday that relevant authorities had already released information on the case.\"China is a country ruled by law, and Chinese judicial organs handle cases according to law; everyone is equal in face of the law,\" the spokesperson said.Liu, a prominent investigative reporter in China, was previously arrested in 2013 on suspicion of defamation after accusing a high-ranking official of corruption.After his release in 2014, he continued his investigations and published his reports on social media.Wu is frequently listed as Liu's collaborator on a public WeChat account where Liu and other journalists post news articles.According to Chinese Human Rights Defenders, which is a coalition of Chinese and international activists and groups, Liu had planned to take a train from his home city of Chongqing to the capital Beijing on Sunday when he went missing.Wu was taken by police in Hebei province on the same day, the group said.According to rights groups, the pair's recent report had exposed a county official's alleged corruption.The title of the report - which cannot be found on WeChat any more - had referred to businesses driven to bankruptcy due to the official's actions.Before Liu's arrest this week, he had posted to WeChat several messages he had received from a Chengdu disciplinary inspection official urging him to contact authorities rather than publish reports in the media, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said.\"This arrest highlights just how restrictive and hostile China has become toward independent reporting,\" RSF advocacy manager Aleksandra Bielakowska said in a statement.\"We call on the international community to intensify pressure on the Chinese regime, rather than pursue a normalisation of relations that only enables further repression and allows the authorities to continue targeting reliable reporters.\"There are more than 120 journalists detained in China, according to RSF, which calls the country \"the world's biggest jailer of journalists\".",

    "body": "Just nowPaul KirbyEurope digital editor in OsloNTB/Ane Hem/via REUTERSMarius Borg Høiby is giving evidence after the first woman he is alleged to have raped told the court she believed she had been druggedThe son of Norway's crown princess has begun giving evidence at his trial for rape and more than 30 other alleged offences.Marius Borg Høiby, 29, looked overwhelmed by the occasion, his voice quivering as he paused several times to take off his glasses and wipe his eyes. Choking back tears, he said it was very difficult to talk, and complained of being followed by the press since he was three years old.He denies four allegations of rape as well as other serious charges against him. He was giving evidence after the first woman he is alleged to have raped told the court she believed she had been drugged during an \"after-party\" in the basement of his parents' house in December 2018.The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, spoke of her sense of \"betrayal and shock\" after she was shown videos by police allegedly of him sexually assaulting her shortly after they had had brief, consensual sex.She had already spoken of a \"black hole\" in her memory. She had told the court behind closed doors she had no recollection of what happened.The 29-year-old defendant, who was born four years before his mother, Mette-Marit married Norway's Crown Prince Haakon, is not a member of the royal family or a public figure.During his first appearance in court on Tuesday, he was seen shaking, and he is understood have had hospital treatment overnight, rather than returning to custody.Appearing in court on Wednesday, he took a seat and after several minutes in which he looked overcome by the occasion, he regained his composure and told the court he had had a lot of sex, drugs and alcohol because he had an extreme need of validation.\"I am known for being my mother's son. Nothing else. I have had an extreme need for validation,\" he told the three judges.His trial coincides with a tense moment for his mother, after she was found to have exchanged hundreds of messages with the late US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein over a three-year period.The royal palace said on Wednesday that Crown Princess Mette-Marit had postponed a private trip \"until further notice\", without giving further details.However, the storm of criticism over the unguarded, warm tone of the exchanges has heaped pressure on the royal house, when Mette-Marit is also seeing her son on trial for rape. She has expressed regret and poor judgement over the correspondence.The defendant, wearing a dark turtle-neck woollen sweater with a zip, looked straight at the three judges who were sitting about 10m (30ft) away at the front of the court.Although he had notes, he did not look down at them, speaking for about half an hour without interruption.He sat, not looking to his left where two of the women he is alleged to have raped listened to his evidence a short distance away. He spoke of how he met the first woman he is alleged to have raped, talking about how they had met at a party, and he had taken cocaine for the first time.",

    "body": "Collision with Greek coast guard boat leaves 15 migrants dead41 minutes agoNikos PapanikolaouandOlivia IrelandBBCA pursuit was under way at the time of the collision, the coastguard says (file photo)At least 15 migrants have died after a speedboat carrying them collided with a Greek coast guard vessel off the coast of the island of Chios late on Tuesday.Greek authorities said the speedboat was making dangerous manoeuvres and that a pursuit was under way at the time of the collision in the Chios Strait, near the village of Vrontados.Twenty-four people were rescued, some of whom were seriously injured, and others are reportedly still missing. Greek TV reports that the survivors say they are mostly Afghans.Confirming the collision, the coast guard said the speedboat had capsized and sunk.Searches in the area continued on Wednesday.The incident comes amid continued scrutiny of Greece's handling of migrant crossings following the Pylos shipwreck in June 2023, when hundreds of migrants died after an overcrowded fishing boat sank off the country's southern coast. That disaster prompted investigations by Greek and international authorities into the role of the coast guard and wider search-and-rescue practices in the region.A search and rescue operation continued on Wednesday in the waters off Myrsinidi beach, which involved four coastguard vessels, a privately owned boat carrying civilian divers and a helicopter.Greek state broadcaster ERT said the injured included seven children, a pregnant woman and two coastguard officers.The coast guard confirmed an inflatable patrol boat had seen an inflatable speedboat with foreign passengers and had been moving without navigation lights towards the eastern coast of Chios. Authorities say light and sound signals were made to the speedboat but it did not stop, reversing course instead and colliding with the patrol boat on the starboard side. The speedboat then capsized and sank, with all passengers falling into the sea. The 25 injured people included seven men, seven women and 11 minors who were all taken to the Skylitseio Hospital. Later, one of the women died. Three of the injured people had surgery after the accident caused serious trauma to their vital organs. Hospital authorities said two pregnant women among the injured were going to have surgery after doctors said the foetuses had no cardiac activity.Many of the injured were also being treated for hypothermia, head injuries and fractures.Greek Migration Minister Thanos Plevris said the deaths were a \"tragic incident\" while speaking during a debate in parliament about toughening criminal penalties against traffickers, AFP news agency reports.\"The criminals are the traffickers... who tried to drop off the migrants at Chios,\" he added.Two members of the coast guard were also taken to hospital, with one man discharged and a woman held for further examinations.The coast guard confirmed two patrol boats had picked up a total of 14 bodies - those of 11 men and three women. The bodies were taken to hospital for autopsies and the Central Port Authority of Chios has begun an investigation.Greece's navy also issued a navigational warning, placing the search area under Greek co-ordination. Naval vessels in the area were put on alert to assist if requested by the search and rescue coordination centre.",

The pupil fled the classroom before being caught in the schoolyard, and was later arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.Toulon's public prosecutor Raphaël Balland said the suspect did not appear to have had a religious or political motive, adding: \"All we know is that there had been tensions with this teacher recently, and he was angry with her.\"La Guicharde school was evacuated after the attack in the early afternoon and Wednesday's lessons were cancelled, a regional education official said.Earlier on Tuesday, France's Education Minister Edouard Geffray said he was heading \"immediately\" to the school in Sanary-sur-Mer, a coastal area of the Var region.\"My thoughts immediately go to the victim, her family, and the entire educational community, whose deep shock I share,\" he wrote on X.It is the latest in a series of attacks by students in French schools in recent years.In 2025, a 14-year-old was charged with the murder of a teaching assistant after allegedly stabbing her to death in June. In a separate case in April, a student killed a girl and wounded several others in a knife attack in the western city of Nantes.In 2020, teacher Samuel Paty was murdered by a Chechen refugee outside the school where he taught in a suburb of Paris, an attack which was motivated by religious extremism.

Israel's military said it launched those strikes after gunmen emerged from a tunnel in the southern Rafah area, beyond the Yellow Line.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said at least 556 people have been killed by Israeli fire, while the Israeli military has said four of its soldiers have been killed in Palestinian attacks.The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,820 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.",

    "body": "11 hours agoNick Springate & Maia DaviesReutersSaif al-Islam Gaddafi's sister told Libyan media he had died near the Libya-Algeria borderSaif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of Libya's former leader Col Muammar Gaddafi, has reportedly been shot dead.The death of the 53-year-old, who was once widely seen as his father's heir apparent, was confirmed by the head of his political team on Tuesday, according to the Libyan News Agency.His lawyer told the AFP news agency a \"four-man commando\" unit carried out an assassination at his home in the city of Zintan, though it was not clear who may have been behind the attack.In a competing version of events, his sister told Libyan TV that he had died near the country's border with Algeria.Saif al-Islam Gaddafi was long seen as the most influential and feared figure in the country after his father, who ruled Libya from 1969 until being ousted and killed during an uprising in 2011.Born in 1972, he played a key role in Libya's rapprochement with the West from 2000 until the collapse of the Gaddafi regime.After his father's removal, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi - who was accused of playing a key role in the brutal repression of anti-government protests - was jailed by a rival militia in the city of Zintan for almost six years.The International Criminal Court wanted to put him on trial for crimes against humanity for his alleged role in the suppression of opposition protests in 2011. In 2015, he was given a death sentence in absentia for his role in the crackdown by a court in Tripoli, in the west of the country, where control is in the hands of the UN-backed government.But he was released by militia in Tobruk, in the east, under an amnesty law two years later.Since the overthrow of Gaddafi, Libya has been split into areas controlled by various militias and is currently divided between two rival governments.During his father's time as leader, he shaped policy and led high-profile negotiations despite having no official role in government, including those which led his father to abandon his nuclear weapons programme.Such agreements saw international sanctions on the north African country lifted, and some considered Gaddafi a reformist and acceptable face of a changing Libya.Gaddafi had always denied that he wanted to inherit power from his father, saying the reins of power were \"not a farm to inherit\".However, in 2021 he announced he would run for the presidency in elections which were then postponed indefinitely.Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "45 minutes agoKhanyisile NgcoboJohannesburgGallo via Getty ImagesJohn Steenhuisen has served as the Democratic Alliance leader since 2019South Africa's Democratic Alliance (DA) leader John Steenhuisen has said he will not seek re-election as the party's leader in April - a move that may threaten the stability of the coalition government.The DA, South Africa's second largest party, entered into a coalition with its arch rival the African National Congress in 2024 after the ANC lost its parliamentary majority.Steenhuisen took over leadership of the pro-business DA in 2019 and currently serves as agriculture minister in President Cyril Ramaphosa's government.The 49-year-old was widely expected to run again but was reportedly forced to abandon his bid because of several controversies.\"For the rest of this term of office, I will focus all of my time and energy as minister of agriculture on defeating the most devastating foot-and-mouth disease outbreak our country has ever seen,\" he told a press conference.Steenhuisen began his political career aged 22 when he was elected to the council of the the port city of Durban for the Democratic Party, the DA's predecessor.He rose up through the party's local and then regional leadership before becoming leader of the party, which traditionally has a white support base, two decades later.It was widely reported that Steenhuisen would run unopposed for the leadership at the DA's upcoming conference.But it seems a variety of issues led to his decision not to do so, including his fallout with another senior DA member, ex-Environment Affairs Minister Dion George, and allegations, of which he was cleared in January, that he had abused his party credit card.He has also been criticised for his handling of the foot-and-mouth outbreak, with farmers accusing his department of being an \"obstacle in a crisis\", according to South Africa's News24 website.The country has struggled over the past four years to contain the highly infectious virus that has now spread to most the country's provinces - badly affecting the livestock industry.It causes blisters inside an animal's mouth and under their hooves, which can cause lameness and problems feeding. In dairy cattle, milk yields will be lost and the cattle's value will be permanently reduced.Under Steenhuisen, the DA party agreed to join the ANC as its biggest partner in the government of national unity nearly two years ago.It was an historic moment for the country as the ANC, the party that  brought in democratic rule in 1994 with Nelson Mandela and ended white-minority rule, had lost its parliamentary majority.No DA leaders have announced their candidacies for the top post yet, but Cape Town mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis has been touted as a possible successor. Steenhuisen and Hill-Lewis are close and the latter has repeatedly said he would not run against his friend, according to the TimesLive news site.More BBC stories on South Africa:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "21 minutes agoChristal HayesWatch: Melinda Gates reacts to appearance of ex-husband in Epstein filesBillionaire philanthropist Melinda French Gates has said her ex-husband, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, being named in new files relating to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein dredged up \"painful times in my marriage\".She told an NPR podcast she felt \"unbelievable sadness\", and that \"whatever questions remain\" needed to be answered by those named in the records, including her ex-husband.\"I am so happy to be away from all the muck,\" she said. The couple divorced in 2021.Records released by the US justice department include an allegation by Epstein that Bill Gates caught a sexually transmitted disease. Gates's spokesperson has called the claim \"absolutely absurd\".The BBC has contacted his representatives for comments about his ex-wife's remarks. Bill Gates has not been accused of wrongdoing by any of Epstein's victims, and the appearance of his name in the files does not imply criminal activity of any kind. The billionaire has broken his silence on the release of files by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) in an interview with 9News in Australia. He said the interactions with Epstein were limited to dinners and that did not visit Epstein's island. \"Every minute I spent with him I regret and I apologise that I did that,\" Gates added. 'It's false': Bill Gates on Epstein emailIn the interview with NPR's Wild Card podcast, Melinda French Gates said: \"For me, it's personally hard whenever those details come up, right? Because it brings back memories of some very, very painful times in my marriage.\"She added: \"Whatever questions remain there of what - I can't even begin to know all of it - those questions are for those people and for even my ex-husband. They need to answer to those things, not me.\"US media have reported that before their separation - which followed 27 years of marriage - Melinda French Gates had been upset about her husband's association with Epstein. After their split was announced, Bill Gates acknowledged having had an affair with a Microsoft employee in 2019. Two emails from 18 July 2013 appear to have been drafted by Epstein, but it is unclear if they were ever sent to Gates. Both were sent from Epstein's email account and back to the same account, while no email account associated with Gates is visible and both emails are unsigned.One email is written as a resignation letter from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and complains about having had to procure medicine for Bill \"to deal with the consequences of sex with Russian girls\".The other, which begins \"dear Bill\", complains about Bill Gates having ended a friendship and makes more claims about Bill Gates having tried to cover up a sexually transmitted infection, including from his then-wife, Melinda.In his interview with Australian media, Bill Gates added that email was never sent and that the contents of it were \"false\". Over the years, Bill Gates and his representatives have downplayed his connection with Epstein. He has previously said they only had \"several dinners\" to discuss a philanthropy project that did not happen. After the latest allegations, a spokesperson for Bill Gates said: \"The only thing these documents demonstrate is Epstein's frustration that he did not have an ongoing relationship with Gates and the lengths he would go to entrap and defame.\"They added: \"These claims – from a proven, disgruntled liar – are absolutely absurd and completely false.\"Many of the documents, emails and photos included in the millions of files released by the DOJ last week shed light on Epstein's vast network of celebrities, business chiefs and world leaders - contacts that persisted in some cases even after his 2008 conviction for soliciting sex from a 14-year-old girl. Epstein died in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial in a sex-trafficking case. ",

    "body": "16 hours agoTiffany WertheimerEPA/ShutterstockPedro Sánchez said the changes would protect children from the \"digital Wild West\"Spain has become the latest European country to make plans to ban social media for children under the age of 16.\"We will protect them from the digital Wild West,\" Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said at the World Governments Summit in Dubai on Tuesday.The ban, which still needs parliamentary approval, is part of a raft of changes that include making company executives responsible for \"illegal or harmful content\" on their platforms.France, Denmark and Austria have also announced that they are considering their own national age limits.Social media companies have argued that the bans would be ineffective, difficult to implement and could isolate vulnerable teenagers. Reddit is challenging Australia's ban in the High Court.\"Today, our children are exposed to a space they were never meant to navigate alone,\" Sánchez said, describing social media as a place of \"addiction, abuse, pornography, manipulation [and] violence. \"We will no longer accept that. We will protect them.\"Sánchez first mooted a possible ban in November, but on Tuesday, the plan was fleshed out.Under the changes, social media platforms would be required to have effective age verification systems, \"not just check boxes, but real barriers that work,\" the prime minister explained, in a possible reference to the loopholes Australian children use to bypass checks - including simply using a photo of an adult. The new laws would also criminalise manipulating algorithms to amplify illegal content.\"This is something created, promoted, and disseminated by certain actors whom we will investigate, as well as the platforms whose algorithms amplify disinformation in exchange for profit,\" Sánchez said.\"Hiding behind code and claiming that technology is neutral is no longer acceptable.\"There would also be a new system designed to track \"how digital platforms fuel division and amplify hate\". No further details were given on how this would work. Another measure, Sánchez said, would be to \"investigate and prosecute the crimes committed by Grok [X's AI tool], TikTok, and Instagram\". The European Commission has launched an investigation into Grok over concerns it was used to create sexualised images of real people. The UK has announced its own investigation into Grok and on Tuesday in France, the offices of X were raided by the Paris prosecutor's cyber-crime unit as it looked into allegations of offences including unlawful data extraction and complicity in the possession of child pornography.X is yet to respond to either investigation - the BBC has approached it for comment. It has previously characterised the French investigation as an attack on free speech.Sánchez said he hoped to get the laws passed next week, but that could prove difficult because his left-wing coalition government lacks a parliamentary majority. Spain's main opposition party, the conservative People's Party, seems to approve of the ban, saying it has previously proposed similar restrictions. The far-right Vox party has spoken out against it, however.In response to the announcement, X owner Elon Musk labelled Sánchez as a \"tyrant and traitor to the people of Spain\".TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube, Reddit, Discord and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram have all been approached for comment.France has led the charge in Europe, with President Emmanuel Macron saying he wants a ban for under-15s in place by the start of the next school year in September.",

    "body": "1 hour agoPaulin KolaandKathryn ArmstrongReutersCommunal kitchens are heating centres are springing up as Kyiv runs out of power and heatingRussia's attacks on Ukraine's energy sector on Monday night - as temperatures dropped to -20C (-4F) - were \"barbaric\" and \"particularly depraved\", UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said.He made the comments after speaking to US President Donald Trump hours after Russia hit power plants and critical infrastructure in the capital, Kyiv, and elsewhere.It comes at the end of a week-long pause that Trump had asked Russia's President Vladimir Putin to observe as a fierce cold swept Ukraine.Trump told reporters that Putin had \"kept his word\" and that he would like him to end the war. US envoys are meeting Ukrainian and Russian negotiators in Abu Dhabi to discuss details of a peace plan.Asked by reporters on whether he was disappointed with Russia's renewed attacks, Trump said, \"it [the agreement] was on Sunday, and he [Putin] went from Sunday to Sunday.\"It's a lot, you know, one week, we'll take anything, because it's really, really cold over there.\" The US president has been leading efforts to end the war, but his Russian counterpart has refused calls for a ceasefire.More on this storyThe damage from Russia's latest attacks has been extensive, with more than 1,000 tower blocks in Kyiv without heating and a power plant in the eastern city of Kharkiv beyond repair.Residents have been forced to spend the night sheltering in metro stations, with some pitching tents on the platforms to protect them from the freezing cold.The authorities have been setting up centres around Kyiv for the city's inhabitants to go to warm up. They are also importing more generators in order to cope with longer blackout periods as engineers try to repair damage.Ukraine's Energy Minister, Denys Shmyhal, has said that the situation with the country's energy system remains \"difficult\" and that they would take some time to repair.This includes Kyiv's Darnytsia Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant, which Shmyhal said had been \"severely damaged\". Iryna Vovk is a psychologist who lives in Kyiv with her daughter. Her husband is away fighting.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Vovk said she was considering moving to her parents' village because of the problems accessing electricity and water in the city.\"Here in Kyiv, life is very awful,\" she said.Asked how her daughter is coping, Vovk said she was \"okay in general\".\"She tries to smile and lead a normal life but it's not a normal life. She cannot study [like] normal, she cannot use online lessons.\"Ukraine has complained repeatedly of a shortage of missiles - urging allies to deliver more.The Ukrainian Air Force said it was attacked by more than 100 drones early on Wednesday. It added that, while it had intercepted most of these, drone strikes were reported in 14 locations, along with falling debris.The head of Dnipropetrovsk's military administration, Oleksandr Ganzha, said a 68-year-old woman and a 38-year-old man were killed during a Russian attack. Two other people were injured.In the Zaporizhzhia region, leader Ivan Federov said three people were killed and 11 wounded, including children, during attacks on Tuesday evening that continued overnight. The Russian-controlled government in Luhansk said a man and a woman were also killed on Tuesday night in a drone attack, launched by Ukraine, that hit a minibus. At least five injuries were reported in Odesa during strikes that damaged residential buildings, according to the head of the city's military administration, Serhiy Lysak.\"It happened just as I was about to fall asleep. My apartment is completely destroyed, there is nothing left. Only some furniture near the walls survived,\" one local woman, Olena, told Ukraine's national public broadcaster.ReutersPolice officer carries a part of a Russian drone at the site of a residential building in Kyiv on 3 February, 2026In Russia itself, the governor of the western Bryansk region, Alexandra Bogomaz, said Ukraine had launched a \"combined attack\" including drones and long-range missiles - destroying a residential building and injuring one person.Further south in Belgorod, close to the border with Ukraine, governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said work was continuing to restore power and water services following a Ukrainian missile strike there earlier in the week. Meanwhile, top US envoys are meeting negotiators from Russia and Ukraine in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday and Thursday. Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner - Trump's son-in-law - are joining teams of Russian and Ukrainian negotiators to thrash out the US-proposed peace deal.The most difficult issue on the table concerns Russian demands for Ukraine to cede the rest of the territory of the eastern industrial region of Donbas that Moscow does not currently control.Russia has made slow progress in the area recently. It launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour in February 2022.  ",

    "body": "'I don't think I am a hero': Boy, 13, describes 'superhuman' swim to save family23 hours agoFlora DruryAustin Appelbee, alongside his mother Joanne, tells the BBC he \"was really scared\"The 13-year-old Australian boy who swam for hours to get help for his family after they were swept out to sea has told the BBC \"I didn't think I was a hero - I just did what I did\".Austin Appelbee didn't know if his mother Joanne, brother Beau and sister Grace were still alive when he finally reached the shore, four hours after he left them in the water clinging to two paddleboards.Miles out to sea off Australia's west coast - the waves getting bigger, the light beginning to fade - his mother feared he too may not have made it.Only hours later, after Joanne finally spotted the rescue boat, did she know he was safe. By that time she and the children had drifted 14km (8.5 miles) offshore.What had started as a family day at the beach had ended in a 10-hour ordeal for Joanne and her family. Austin's swim to raise the alarm was later described as \"superhuman\" by rescuers.\"I had assumed Austin hadn't made it,\" Joanne, 47, told the BBC News channel.In the end though, \"it was an absolute perfect ending to have them all well and happy and sore but no injuries\".'A tough battle'The family had been due to head home to Perth last Friday and were having \"a bit of fun\" with two paddleboards and a kayak in the shallow water off the beach, Joanne explained, when the children \"went out a bit too far\". \"The wind picked up and it went from there,\" she recalled. \"We lost oars, and we drifted out further.... It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly.\"Finding themselves drifting further and further out from Quindalup beach, in Western Australia, Joanne realised she needed to do something - but she couldn't leave Beau, 12, and Grace, eight, alone.\"Early on, we sent this young man back in to try and get help because it didn't look like we were that far from the shoreline,\" she said.Austin took the kayak, but no one realised it had been badly damaged and was already taking on water. \"It started flipping, and then I lost an oar and I knew I was in trouble,\" he recalled. \"I started paddling with my arm.\"At one point, he managed to get the kayak to work - before it threw him for the last time.Clinging to the capsized kayak, Austin - who swears he \"saw something in the water\" - realised he needed to do something.\"It was getting dangerous now - I had been out for a couple of hours.\"Getty ImagesThe family were having a holiday in Geographe Bay, Western AustraliaHe had lost sight of his family, who had also lost sight of him. As Joanne and the children drifted further out to sea, the waves got bigger and bigger, making it harder to stay on the boards, while visibility had also got worse. They were all wearing life jackets - but they had no food or water.\"I had assumed Austin had made it a lot quicker than he had,\" she said. \"As the day progressed, no vessels and nothing coming to save us. \"If he hasn't made it, what have I done, have I made the wrong decision, and is anyone going to come and save my other two?\"Austin, meanwhile, had started to swim the last 4km (two nautical miles), abandoning his own lifejacket after a time because it was not helping him. Throughout the next two hours, it was prayer, Christian songs and \"happy thoughts\" which kept the \"really scared\" 13-year-old going.\"I was thinking about mum, Beau and Grace. I was also thinking about my friends and my girlfriend - I have a really good bunch of friends,\" he said. \"When I hit the floor I thought, how am I on land right now - is this a dream?\"Then he had another thought: his family \"could still be alive out there - I have to go save them\".It was about 18:00 local time (10:00 GMT) when he finally reached his mother's bag and rang for help.The call sparked a huge search, police said in a statement on Monday.Austin - who had passed out after making the call - was taken to hospital where he called his father, bawling his eyes out. He still didn't know if Joanne and his siblings were alive.Then, minutes later, he got a call to say they had been found. Everyone - doctors and police officers - were jumping up and down with joy.\"It was a moment I will never forget,\" said Austin.ABC News/Briana ShepherdJoanne and Austin with Beau, 12, and Grace, eightOut at sea, Joanne had been struggling to keep hold of her younger children. They were freezing cold, and it was now dark. She now feared the worst had happened to Austin.\"We couldn't see anything coming to save us,\" she said. \"It was very much getting to that point where we are on our own.\"Joanne couldn't even relax when she saw the boat approaching: the children had fallen into the water and she was desperately trying to reach them. \"It was an absolute nightmare,\" she said.Back on dry land, they were treated at hospital for minor injuries. The same ambulance worker who picked up Austin was able to confirm - finally - he too had survived.He's even been back at school - admittedly on crutches, as his legs were so sore.Now, less than five days later, Austin is still trying to process what happened. He certainly doesn't see himself as a hero, despite what people keep telling him. It was, he acknowledged, a \"tough battle\".His praise is reserved for the \"lovely ambulance crew\" and the \"really quick response\" from triple zero, the emergency services.Others, however, have been effusive with their praise for Austin.Naturaliste Volunteer Marine Rescue Group's commander Paul Bresland described the efforts of the teenager as \"superhuman\".Meanwhile, Insp James Bradley said his actions \"cannot be praised highly enough - his determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings\".",

    "body": "18 hours agoIan AikmanUS Navy via ReutersThe drone was \"aggressively\" approaching the USS Abraham Lincoln, a spokesman said (file photo) An Iranian drone was shot down as it \"aggressively approached\" an American aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea on Tuesday, a US military spokesman has said.An F-35C stealth fighter jet which took off from the USS Abraham Lincoln warship shot down the drone \"in self-defence\" to protect the aircraft carrier and its personnel, US Central Command spokesman Capt Tim Hawkins said.The ship was approximately 500 miles from the Iranian coast when the drone approached it with \"unclear intent\".No US equipment was damaged and no service members were harmed.It comes as the US continues to build up a military presence in the region, with tensions high between Washington and Tehran.US President Donald Trump has threatened to take military action against Iran if it does not negotiate an agreement to restrict its nuclear programme. Speaking after the downing of the Iranian drone, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that negotiations between the US and Iran are still scheduled for later this week.She said Trump \"remains committed to always pursuing diplomacy first\", but added he \"has always a range of options on the table, and that includes the use of military force\".Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has previously warned that any attack on the country would spark a \"regional war\".Tehran has not commented on Tuesday's drone incident. In a separate incident on Tuesday, the US military said Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) forces had \"harassed a US-flagged, US-crewed merchant vessel\" in the Strait of Hormuz - the world's busiest oil shipping channel.Military support \"de-escalated\" the situation and the tanker proceeded safely, Capt Hawkins said.Also on Tuesday, Leavitt said US special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's most senior overseas envoy, will attend the talks on behalf of the White House.US media had previously reported he would meet Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Istanbul on Friday, with the foreign ministers of Egypt, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also invited.But US news website Axios has since cited two sources as saying Tehran wanted the venue moved to Oman, with only Iranian and US officials present.The US had agreed to this request, the website reported, citing an Arab source. The BBC has reached out to the White House for comment. Ahead of the planned talks, Washington has repeatedly reminded Tehran of the US strikes on Iran last year, which Trump said had \"obliterated\" the country's nuclear enrichment facilities.He said a fresh attack would be \"far worse\" than those air strikes, which were launched last June during Israel's 12-day war with Iran.The Israeli military also targeted Iran's nuclear facilities and scientists during a short direct conflict, as well as its military commanders and missile arsenal.Tehran responded to the strikes by launching hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel. It also carried out a missile attack on a major US air base in Qatar.Iran has insisted its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and denies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.Last week, Trump told reporters at the White House that Iranian officials \"do want to make a deal\", and that they must commit to \"no nuclear\" and to \"stop killing protesters\". The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has said it has confirmed the killing of 6,424 protesters, 152 children, 214 people associated with the government, and 58 bystanders. It is also investigating reports of another 11,280 deaths.Norway-based Iran Human Rights has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.Iranian authorities have acknowledged that at least 3,117 people were killed, but said the majority were members of the security forces or bystanders killed by \"rioters\".The unrest was sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency and soaring cost of living, but it quickly developed into demands for political change.Khamenei described the unrest as \"sedition\" orchestrated by the US and Israel.",

    "body": "21 hours agoJames GallagherHealth and science correspondentHindustan Times via Getty ImagesAir quality around the Delhi region of India reached 'severe' levels in NovemberSeven million people's cancer could be prevented each year, according to the first global analysis.A report by World Health Organization (WHO) scientists estimates 37% of cancers are caused by infections, lifestyle choices and environmental pollutants that could be avoided.This includes cervical cancers caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) infections which vaccination can help prevent, as well as a host of tumours caused by tobacco smoke from cigarettes.The researchers said their report showed there is a \"powerful opportunity\" to transform the lives of millions of people.Some cancers are inevitable - either because of damage we unavoidably build up in our DNA as we age or because we inherit genes that put us at greater risk of the disease.But researcher Dr Isabelle Soerjomataram said \"people are surprised to hear\" that nearly four in 10 cancers can be prevented as it is \"a substantial number\".The International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of the WHO, analysed 30 preventable factors known to increase the risk of cancer.These include smoking and ultraviolet (UV) radiation which can directly damage our DNA; obesity and too little physical activity which alter inflammation and hormones in the body to raise cancer risk; and air pollution which can wake up dormant cancer cells.The agency's report also looked at nine cancer-causing infections including HPV, hepatitis viruses which lead to liver cancer and the stomach bug H. pylori.The team used data on cancer cases from 2022 and from the 30 risk factors a decade earlier – across 185 countries - to perform their statistical analysis.The big three contributors to more than 18 million cancer cases around the world were found to be:smoking tobacco which caused 3.3 million cancersinfections causing 2.3 million cancersalcohol use leading to 700,000 cancers Getty ImagesSmoking and alcohol were two of the main causes of preventable cancersHowever, the overall figures mask a nuanced picture of cancer risk around the world.There is a stark sex-divide with 45% of men's cancers being preventable compared with 30% in women, partly down to higher levels of smoking among men.In women living in Europe, the top three preventable causes of cancer are smoking, closely followed by infection and then obesity.While in sub-Saharan Africa, infections dominate and account for nearly 80% of preventable cancers in women.This means any measures to tackle these cancers would need to be tailored to each region or country.\"This landmark study is a comprehensive assessment of preventable cancer worldwide, incorporating for the first time infectious causes of cancer alongside behavioural, environmental, and occupational risks,\" said Soerjomataram, the deputy head of the IARC Cancer Surveillance Unit.\"Addressing these preventable causes represents one of the most powerful opportunities to reduce the global cancer burden.\"The report, published in the journal Nature Medicine, showed lung cancer (linked to smoking and air pollution) stomach cancer (linked to H. pylori infection) and cervical cancer (linked to HPV infection) made up nearly half of all preventable cases of cancer.Dr Andre Ilbawi, team lead for cancer control at WHO, said the study was \"good news\" as it showed something could be done and he pointed to the success of countries that have introduced policies to tackle smoking or vaccinate against HPV.\"The percentage of preventable cancers can change over time and our goal is to get it as close to zero as possible,\" he said.",

    "body": "House shelves contempt vote as Clintons agree to testify in Epstein investigation14 hours agoSakshi VenkatramanWatch: Why is no one being prosecuted over the Epstein files?Former US President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State, have agreed to testify in the congressional investigation into late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, allowing them to avoid being found in contempt of Congress.The House of Representatives had been poised to vote this week on holding the couple in contempt for refusing to appear before the chamber's Oversight Committee.Bill Clinton was acquainted with Epstein, who died in prison in 2019, but has denied knowledge of his sex offending and says he cut off contact two decades ago. He will appear for a deposition on 27 February, and Hillary Clinton will appear the day before.It will be the first time a former US president has testified to a congressional panel since Gerald Ford did so in 1983.The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has asked for the depositions to be filmed and transcribed, with no time limit. On Tuesday, House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman James Comer said: \"Once it became clear that we would hold them in contempt, the Clintons completely caved.\"\"Republicans and Democrats on the Oversight Committee have been clear: no one is above the law - and that includes the Clintons,\" he added in a statement. The House was expected to vote this week on holding the former president and former secretary of state in criminal contempt of Congress, but the plans were abruptly put on hold on Monday as the Clintons' legal team said they would agree to the committee's terms.The couple, both Democrats, had previously struck a defiant tone, saying they had already submitted sworn statements covering the \"limited information\" they had on Epstein.They had dismissed the legal summonses issued by the panel as \"nothing more than a ploy to attempt to embarrass political rivals, as President Trump has directed\".The oversight committee then approved a measure to hold the Clintons in contempt late last month, with the support of several Democrats.On Saturday, as a vote in the full House loomed, lawyers for the Clintons made an offer to provide limited testimony that would have centred on a four-hour interview by Bill Clinton. But Comer expressed concerns that the former president would stonewall questions and run down the clock.On Monday evening, Bill Clinton's Deputy Chief of Staff Angel Ureña posted on X confirming the couple would appear before the panel.\"They negotiated in good faith,\" Ureña wrote in a tweet directed at the House Oversight Committee. \"You did not. \"They told you under oath what they know, but you don't care. But the former President and former Secretary of State will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.\"If the House had approved a contempt resolution, it would have been referred to the justice department, which then could have decided whether to prosecute the Clintons.Neither Clinton has been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein's abuse, and they have denied knowledge of his sex offending.Hillary Clinton, former US senator and secretary of state, and the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016, has said she never met or spoke to Epstein.US Department of JusticeBill Clinton in a hot tub, in the Epstein filesEpstein's private jet logs show that Clinton took four international flights in 2002 and 2003.Shortly after Epstein was arrested on sex trafficking charges in July 2019, Clinton's spokesperson said the former president took trips on the plane including \"stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation\".The former president also appears at the late financier's estate in photos that were among a batch of records released by the justice department to comply with a law passed by Congress mandating the disclosure of all investigative material relating to the late convicted paedophile.One picture shows the former president swimming in a pool, and another shows him lying on his back with his hands behind his head in what appears to be a hot tub.Ureña, Clinton's spokesman, said at the time the photos were released in December that they were decades old and Clinton had stopped associating with Epstein before his crimes came to light.Watch: What's in the latest batch of released Epstein files?Last month, the Clintons wrote a letter to Comer criticising his handling of the Epstein investigation. \"The decisions you have made, and the priorities you have set as chairman regarding the Epstein investigation, have prevented progress in discovering the facts about the government's role,\" the letter said. They added: \"There is no plausible explanation for what you are doing other than partisan politics.\"",

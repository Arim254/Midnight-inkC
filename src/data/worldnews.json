    "body": "Clashes between anti-government protesters and riot police in the Peruvian capital, Lima, have left a 32-year-old man dead and more than 100 people injured, including many police officers.The protests come less than a week after José Jerí was sworn in as the interim president following the impeachment of his predecessor in office, Dina Boluarte.Wednesday's demonstrations were organised by mainly young Peruvians who demand that the country's political class do more to combat high levels of crime and corruption. President Jerí said the protest had been infiltrated by criminals set on causing chaos and launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the protester's death.He wrote on X that he \"regretted the death\" of Eduardo Ruiz Sáenz, but did not give further details as to what caused it. Ruth Luque, a left-wing member of Congress, meanwhile said that \"preliminary information\" indicated the hip hop artist had been killed by a bullet wound to the chest. Luque posted a photo of herself on social media in which she can be seen speaking to a member of staff at the hospital to which many of those injured in the clashes were taken.Local media quoted witnesses who said they saw the musician being shot by a man they accused of being a plainclothes police officer.President Jerí said an investigation would be launched \"to determine objectively what happened and who is responsible\".Jerí of the conservative Somos Perú party was sworn into office on Friday last week after the then-President, Dina Boluarte, was impeached on grounds of \"permanent moral incapacity\".Jerí is the seventh president to lead Peru in the space of eight years.As head of parliament, he was next in line to fill the post left vacant following Boluarte's ouster, to serve out the remainder of her term until the presidential election scheduled for April of next year.But within days of him taking office, anger at what protesters call the \"political class\" has spread with thousands taking to the streets to demand \"a clean slate\".The protesters also demanded that the government do more to combat corruption and crime, specifically a wave of extortions which has seen bus and taxi drivers threatened by gangs.Young activists organised protests in several major cities and demanded that Jerí step aside in favour of an independent lawmaker. In a message uploaded to TikTok, one of them calling himself \"Lando\" accused Jerí's party of having propped up Boluarte, whose popularity rates were in the single figures before her removal. Somos Perú, which in the past had backed Boluarte, switched sides last week and joined the chorus of those demanding she be impeached. Analysts say that the armed attack by gunmen on a band on 8 October and the outcry it triggered meant that lawmakers who had previously supported Boluarte felt her position had become untenable. The ex-president remains in Peru and said earlier this week that she would stay in the country pending several investigations into alleged abuses of power, which she denies. ",

    "body": "India's foreign ministry has said it is \"not aware\" of a phone call in which US President Donald Trump claimed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to stop purchasing Russian oil. On Wednesday, Trump said his Indian counterpart had \"assured me today\" that it would end Russian oil imports, a move the US has pushed for in a bid to increase economic pressure on the Kremlin to end the war in Ukraine.But asked about the call on Thursday, an Indian government spokesman cast doubt on Trump's account, saying he was \"not aware of any conversation between the two leaders\" taking place the previous day.The Indian government had earlier said discussions were still \"ongoing\" with the US over its Russian oil purchases. It comes as a White House official confirmed to the BBC that Trump plans to speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a call on Thursday.India has become a key energy customer for Russia since the outbreak of the war, partly allowing the Kremlin to withstand the impact of Ukrainian allies slashing oil and gas imports, the country's biggest export market. The Trump administration has put public and diplomatic pressure on India to end its support for the Russian energy market as it seeks to increase the Kremlin's economic isolation and force an end to the war. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Speaking at the White House on Wednesday, Trump said he had received assurances from Modi on Wednesday that India would halt its purchases \"within a short period of time\".In its initial response, the Indian government did not directly dispute that the call between Trump and Modi had taken place. It read: \"Our consistent priority to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario. Our import policies are guided entirely by this objective.\"The Indian government's second response on Thursday raises further questions over whether a deal has been struck between Washington and Delhi.BBC News has contacted the White House and State Department for comment.Delhi's continued reliance on Russian crude oil, which it imports at a discount, have become a key source of contention in US-India relations under the Trump administration, which has taken a tougher line on the Ukraine war after Putin failed to agree a peace deal with the White House.India is second only to China for how much Russian energy it imports, funding which helps to prevent the collapse of Russia's critical fossil fuel industry. Modi's government has accused Ukraine's allies of hypocrisy, pointing to ongoing trade with Russia, including energy imports to the European Union, albeit at reduced levels.In its latest round of sanctions unveiled this week, the UK government said it would target a major Indian oil refinery as it \"continue(s) to get facilitate getting Russian oil onto global markets\". Officials said India's Nayara Energy Limited imported 100 million barrels of Russian crude oil worth more than $5bn (£3.75bn) in 2024 alone.",

    "body": "7 hours agoDearbail JordanWatch: Wreckage of the Titan submersible on the ocean floor OceanGate's Titan submersible imploded on its journey to the wreck of the Titantic because of poor engineering and multiple failures to test the vessel, according to an official report.Titan imploded in June 2023, killing all five passengers on board including OceanGate's chief executive.The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found the engineering process behind the vehicle was \"inadequate\", resulting in faults which meant it failed to meet strength and durability requirements.The NTSB said because the firm did not adequately test Titan it did not know its actual strength. It was also unaware it was damaged and should have been removed from service before its last voyage.Titan footage shows wreckage of destroyed hull on sea floorWhat the Titan failure has taught us about exploring the deep oceanImplosion: The Titanic Sub DisasterTitan disappeared in the North Atlantic as it attempted to dive to the wreck of Titanic which lies some 372 miles from St. John's in Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada.In August, the US Coast Guard released a damning report into the implosion which found that the incident was \"preventable\" and criticised OceanGate's \"critically flawed\" safety practices.Stockton Rush, OceanGate's chief executive and co-founder, operated the Titan on its final journey.The passengers, who paid up to $250,000 each to take part in the dive, were deep-sea explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman Dawood and Hamish Harding.Designed and built by OceanGate, the Titan was 6.7m (22ft) long with a passenger compartment made of carbon fibre, with titanium used in its domes and some other segments.The doomed submersible which imploded at a depth of 3,363m (11,033ft) - the Titanic wreck is located at 3,880m - was the second version of the craft. OceanGate had condemned the first version following testing.During its investigation, the NTSB discovered issues with the safety culture at OceanGate.While some employees said safety was a priority, others, including a former director of marine operations and a technician, highlighted an environment \"where safety issues, particularly design issues, were ignored\".One technician at the firm said he had concerns about OceanGate's business model, in particular accepting paying clients as \"mission specialists\" as opposed to passengers.Under US regulations, it is illegal to transport passengers in an experimental submersible.The technician told the NTSB that he informed Mr Rush: \"… you can't just change the title of a person when you're receiving compensation.\" In a later conversation on the same subject, the technician recounted that Mr Rush said: \"If the [US] Coast Guard became a problem … he would buy himself a congressman and make it go away\".OceanGate has permanently wound down its operations since the incident.In its report, the NTSB discovered that a contributing factor to the implosion was that US and international voluntary guidance and US small passenger vessel regulations \"were insufficient to ensure OceanGate adhered to established industry standards\".The NTSB has recommended that the US Coast Guard commissions a study into how so-called pressure vessels which carry people are assessed and, if changes are suggested, regulations be updated.

    "body": "EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has said a planned anti-drone system should be \"fully operational by the end of 2027\", as part of a drive to toughen defences against Russia and be fully prepared for possible conflict by 2030.\"Drones are already redefining warfare. Having drone defences is no longer optional for anyone,\" Kallas said, referring to Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and fears that Moscow may attack the EU.The \"defence roadmap\" by the European Commission also proposes strengthening the EU's eastern borders and creating European air and space \"shields\".Several European countries have faced repeated incursions into their airspace and US President Donald Trump has urged the EU to do more to defend itself.Several Western intelligence agencies have warned that Russia could continue its westward aggression after the war in Ukraine is over.\"Danger will not disappear even when the war in Ukraine ends. It is clear we need to toughen our defences against Russia,\" Kallas told reporters in Brussels.Although there seems little chance of the war ending soon, Trump was due to speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin later on Thursday, ahead of talks with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday. Trump has indicated that if Putin does not not move to end the war, the US could send Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles.Standing alongside Kallas, European Defence Commissioner Andrius Kubilius stressed that \"our roadmap shows all the major milestones to achieve defence readiness by 2030, so we can deter Russian aggression, prevent war and preserve peace\".The EU's executive Commission said the 27-member union should be ready by 2030 to \"respond to any crisis, including high-intensity conflict\".It also urged the bloc to \"close critical capability gaps\" - including in air and missile defence, and artillery systems - \"through joint development and procurement\".Many EU countries are also members of Nato and its chief, Mark Rutte, said they were working together to protect member states on the eastern flank from aerial threat.The EU stressed its \"flagship\" projects would be developed in \"close co-ordination\" with Nato, and would not duplicate the Western defensive alliance's work.No estimates were given to the overall cost, but Kubilius said \"we're not talking here about hundreds of billions\".The \"defence roadmap\" still needs to be approved by member states at a leaders' summit next week. However, a number of EU states have already backed plans for a multi-layered \"drone wall\" to quickly detect, then track and destroy Russian drones.In recent weeks,  tensions have escalated between the EU and Russia, after Poland and Romania - both Nato members - said Russian drones had breached their airspace.And Estonia - another Nato member - in September requested urgent consultations  with other alliance members after saying that Russian warplanes had violated its airspace and stayed there for 12 minutes.Russia, which launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, said its planes were on a \"scheduled flight... in strict compliance with international airspace regulations and did not violate the borders of other states\".A number of European politicians and military experts have said that Russia's aim is to test Nato's capabilities and and try to sow discord within the alliance. Several Nato members reacted to the reported Russian incursions by sending troops, artillery, and air defence systems to secure the alliance's eastern flank.",

    "body": "The most prominent Palestinian prisoner, Marwan Barghouti, was beaten unconscious by Israeli prison guards on 14 September, his family has said.The 66-year-old - serving life for planning deadly attacks against Israelis - was allegedly assaulted by eight guards during a transfer between Ganot and Megiddo prisons.The Israel Prison Service told the BBC: \"These are false claims (fake). The Israel Prison Service operates in accordance with the law, while ensuring the safety and health of all inmates\".Barghouti's son, Arab, told the BBC the family had received testimony from five separate detainees who were released this week who heard Barghouti's account of the attack. He said the family was \"horrified\".Barghouti was allegedly handcuffed by the guards, put on the floor, kicked and beaten.\"They focused on the head area, they focused on the chest area and also on the legs,\" he said. \"He stayed unconscious for hours, he was bleeding, and he could hardly walk.\"Arab said he believed the attack took place as his father was transferred between the two prisons, which are in southern and northern Israel, because there were no surveillance cameras to capture it.Barghouti is serving five life sentences plus 40 years after being convicted by an Israeli court in 2004 of planning attacks in which five civilians were killed.The detainees who told the family of the attack had been released as part of Monday's hostage and prisoner exchange between Israel and Hamas, Arab said. Barghouti's name was at the top of a list of seven high-profile prisoners whose release Hamas had sought in return for the 20 living Israeli hostages the group was holding in Gaza - but Israel refused to include him.He is seen by many as the one man who could unite Palestinians - and the various Palestinian political factions - across both Gaza and the occupied West Bank.Opinion polls have consistently indicated that he is the most popular Palestinian leader, and that Palestinians would vote for him in a presidential election ahead of the current Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas or Hamas leaders.Barghouti remains a senior figure in the Fatah faction that dominates the PA, which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under Israeli control. He has been held in solitary confinement since October 2023.Far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who is in charge of the prison service, denied Barghouti had been assaulted, but said he was \"proud\" Barghouti's prison conditions had worsened.In August, a video emerged showing Ben Gvir taunting Barghouti in his cell.The 13-second-long video clip was the first time he had been publicly seen in years. He appeared aged and gaunt.In the clip, Ben Gvir tells him: \"You will not win. He who messes with the people of Israel, he who will murder our children, he who will murder our women, we will wipe him out\".As Barghouti tries to interject, Ben Gvir adds: \"You need to know this, throughout history.\"The PA condemned the video. Its Vice-President Hussein al-Sheikh described it as \"the epitome of psychological, moral and physical terrorism.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoPaul GlynnCulture reporterBritish Library BoardThe date of Oscar Wilde's death, 30 November 1900, has been used as the new card's expiry dateThe British Library has honoured late Irish writer Oscar Wilde by reissuing a reader's card in his name, 130 years after his original was revoked following his conviction for \"gross indecency\".The celebrated novelist, poet and playwright was excluded from the library's reading room in 1895 over his charge for having had homosexual relationships, which was a criminal offence at the time.The new card, which will be collected by his grandson, author Merlin Holland, on Thursday, is intended to \"acknowledge the injustices and immense suffering\" Wilde faced, the library said.Mr Holland said the new card is a \"lovely gesture of forgiveness and I'm sure his spirit will be touched and delighted\".The British LibraryBritish Library papers from June 1895 noted: \"Mr O. Wilde excluded from the reading room\"The decision to revoke Wilde's pass for the library - then the British Museum reading room - was recorded without comment in the trustees' minutes for 15 June 1895.He had been in prison for three weeks at the time after being handed a two-year prison sentence with hard labour.The author was convicted after he lost a libel trial against Lord Queensberry, who had accused him of being homosexual after discovering that his son, Lord Alfred Douglas, aka Bosie, was Wilde's lover.The library regulations at the time said anyone convicted of a crime should have their card revoked.'Letter from prison meant so much'The British Library holds handwritten drafts of some of Wilde's most famous plays including The Importance of Being Ernest, An Ideal Husband, A Woman of No Importance and Lady Windermere's Fan.Its collection also includes De Profundis, the letter he wrote to Bosie from Reading Gaol.Mr Holland, the only living descendant of Wilde, will collect the new card at a ceremony at the venue on what would have been his grandfather's 171st birthday.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday, Mr Holland said he felt both \"proud\" of his grandfather and slightly burderened by the responsibility of handling his legacy.\"People will so often write in to me and say, 'I cannot tell you how much your grandfather's De Profundis meant to me',\" he explained.\"It has a note of positivity at the end... he's going to come out of prison and do something again.\"And people have written to me saying, 'In a moment of terrible depression about my own life I read De Profundis, and I just wanted you to know that your grandfather's letter from prison meant so much to me'.\"British LibraryTrustees' papers noted Wilde's exclusion from the library at the timeDame Carol Black, chair of the British Library, described Wilde as \"one of the most significant literary figures of the nineteenth century\".She said that by reissuing his library card, \"we hope to not only honour Wilde's memory but also acknowledge the injustices and immense suffering he faced as a result of his conviction\".She added that they were \"delighted\" to welcome his grandson - who is the author of a new book, After Oscar: The Legacy of a Scandal - to receive the library card on his behalf.",

    "body": "5 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseWatch: US \"looking at land now\" - Trump confirms CIA authorisation in Venezuela after boat strikesUS President Donald Trump has confirmed a report he authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela, provoking outrage from the South American nation's leader.US forces have already conducted at least five strikes on suspected drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean in recent weeks, killing 27 people. UN-appointed human rights experts have described the raids as \"extrajudicial executions\".Speaking at the White House, Trump said the US \"is looking at land\" as it considers further strikes on drug cartels in the region. Nicolás Maduro, whose legitimacy as Venezuela's president is internationally contested after disputed elections last year, appealed on TV for peace with the US.He addressed the \"people of the United States\", saying \"no war, yes peace\".The increased US military presence in the region has raised fears in Caracas of a possible attack. There are reportedly about 10,000 US forces built up in the Caribbean, either on ships or in Puerto Rico, a US territory.According to the New York Times, Trump's authorisation would allow the CIA to carry out operations in Venezuela unilaterally or as part of any wider US military activity. It remains unknown whether the CIA is planning operations in Venezuela, or whether those plans are being kept as contingencies, but the spy agency has a long history of activities in South America. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday alongside FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump was questioned about the New York Times report.\"Why did you authorise the CIA to go into Venezuela?\" a journalist asked.\"I authorised for two reasons really,\" Trump said in a highly unusual acknowledgement from a US commander-in-chief about an intelligence organisation whose activities are typically shrouded in secrecy. \"Number one, they [Venezuela] have emptied their prisons into the United States of America.\" He added: \"And the other thing are drugs. We have a lot of drugs coming in from Venezuela, and a lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea, so you get to see that, but we're going to stop them by land also.\"Venezuela plays a relatively minor role in the region's drug trade. The president would not be drawn on whether the CIA's goal was to topple Maduro, for whom the US has offered a $50m (£37m) bounty. \"Wouldn't it be a ridiculous question for me to answer?\" he said. In the most recent US strike on Tuesday, six people were killed when a boat was targeted near Venezuela's coast.On Truth Social, Trump said that \"intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known DTO [drug-trafficking organisation] drug-trafficking route\". As has been the case in previous strikes, US officials have not specified what drug-trafficking organisation was allegedly operating the vessel, or the identities of those aboard. Maduro took to the airwaves on Wednesday night to warn against escalation.\"No to regime change, which reminds us so much of the endless, failed wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and so on,\" said the Socialist leader. \"No to CIA-orchestrated coups d'état.\"He added: \"Listen to me, no war, yes peace, the people United States.\"Earlier in the day Maduro ordered military exercises in the Caracas suburb of Petare and in neighbouring Miranda state on Wednesday. In a message on Telegram, he said he was mobilising the military, police and civilian militia to defend the oil-rich country.Foreign Minister Yván Gil said on Telegram that Venezuela \"rejects the warmongering and extravagant statements of the president of the United States\".\"We view with extreme alarm the use of the CIA, as well as the military deployments announced in the Caribbean, which amount to a policy of aggression, threat, and harassment against Venezuela,\" he added.Trump has deployed eight warships, a nuclear-power submarine and fighter jets to the Caribbean in what the White House says is an effort to crack down on drug smuggling.In a leaked memo recently sent to US lawmakers, the Trump administration said it had determined it was involved in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug-trafficking organisations.US officials have alleged that Maduro himself is part of an organisation called the Cartel of the Suns, which they say includes high-ranking Venezuelan military and security officials involved in drug trafficking. Maduro has denied the claims. Mick Mulroy, a former CIA paramilitary officer and Assistant Undersecretary of Defense, told the BBC: \"In order to conduct covert action, there needs to be a presidential finding for the CIA specially authorizing it, with specific actions identified.\"Mulroy added that such a finding would mark a \"substantial increase\" in efforts against drug trafficking organizations.\"Perhaps a real life 'Sicario',\" he said, referring to a 2015 film that depicts US operatives launching clandestine operations against drug cartels in Mexico.Additional reporting by Ione Wells",

    "body": "3 hours agoHugh SchofieldIn ParisAFP via Getty ImagesSébastien Lecornu has had a turbulent start to his job, having resigned last week as prime minister before being reappointedFrance's new prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, has bought himself breathing space after winning two no-confidence motions tabled by the opposition.In the tightest vote, a motion sponsored by the far left fell 18 votes short of the 289 needed to bring him down. It means that after just five days in office, Lecornu has survived a first major ordeal in parliament and can now focus on the task of passing the 2026 budget.Any relief for the prime minister is likely to be short-lived, with the far left and far right still gunning to bring him down. And the Socialists, who threw a lifeline in the no-confidence motions, have made clear they will not be so indulgent next time round.Also, any tactical victory enabling the government to endure for now is more than offset by the huge damage to France's reputation caused by weeks of confusion and capitulation.Appointed by President Emmanuel Macron four weeks ago, then re-appointed in chaotic scenes on Friday after he resigned on Monday, Lecornu only survives thanks to major concessions made to the left.To buy the support of the Socialist Party, which has 65 or so MPs, the prime minister promised to freeze Macron's most important economic reform of his second term – the raising of the retirement age to 64.But he also made another, possibly more important, gift to the opposition, which has big implications for the chances of obtaining a budget in time for the end-of-year deadline.By pledging not to resort to the constitutional device known as the 49:3 – which lets governments force through laws without a vote – Lecornu handed ultimate control over the budget to the parties in parliament.It is a huge shift in power, reflecting the decline of presidential authority since Macron's botched parliamentary dissolution of July 2024.  For many observers  it heralds a return, for good or ill, to the party politicking that was a hallmark of the pre-1958 Fourth Republic.By assuring MPs that they and not the government would have the last word on the future budget, Lecornu managed to convince the Socialists that he was serious about marking a real \"rupture\" from previous Macronite administrations.But he may also have surrendered any prospect of the kind of belt-tightening debt reduction that the money markets and the European Union are demanding.The draft budget tabled by Lecornu on Tuesday aims to reduce the deficit to 4.7% of economic output (GDP) by making savings of €30bn (£26bn), with a squeeze on spending in the health sector and local administration.But the Socialists have joined the rest of the left and the far-right in denouncing the text as a betrayal of the less well-off.   Party leader Olivier Faure said that he would have no compunction about supporting a new vote of censure, if offending parts of the budget are not removed.AFP via Getty ImagesMathilde Panot's radical-left France Unbowed sponsored one of the two failed no-confidence motionsFrance's National Assembly has been split three ways for the last 15 months, with a centre-right bloc of under 200 MPs facing a left-wing alliance of about the same size and a far-right bloc of about 140, plus some independents.  None of the three prime ministers since then has been able to find a reliable majority.Weeks of bickering in Paris have triggered warnings about the public's growing disillusionment with politics - the spectacle appearing to confirm the notion that the prime aim of most politicians is simply to stay in power.President Macron, who is blamed for the crisis by most French voters, has seen his popularity ratings slump to just 14%. He has been in office for eight years, and the far right and far left have called for his resignation before his second term ends in 18 months.According to his one-time adviser, the veteran essayist and confidant of presidents Alain Minc, Macron \"must now go down as the worst president of the Fifth Republic\".Minc said Macron had come to office promising to act as a bulwark against the far right but he had left National Rally at the gates of power.\"If you look around us,\" said Minc, \"the Germans are petrified about what a French collapse will do to the economy. The British are petrified about the strategic implications. The Italians are laughing at us, because we always laughed at them.\"\"In America, President Trump is saying that smooth-talker Macron has got what he deserves. Only in Russia are they smiling.\"",

    "body": "18 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentBBCVirginia Giuffre describes how the photo was taken by Jeffrey Epstein in LondonA posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre accuses the Duke of York of being \"entitled - as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright\", according to extracts published in the Guardian newspaper.The book, Nobody's Girl, written by the prominent accuser of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, is due to be published next week, almost six months after Ms Giuffre took her own life.Her book, which calls Epstein a \"master manipulator\", describes three occasions where she alleges Prince Andrew had sex with her, including at Ghislaine Maxwell's house in London. It's further embarrassment for Prince Andrew, who reached a financial settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, and has always denied any wrongdoing.Getty ImagesVirginia Giuffre holding a picture of herself as a teenagerNobody's Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice, is the testimony of Ms Giuffre, who died by suicide in Australia in April, in a book co-written with author Amy Wallace.Ms Giuffre, who met Jeffrey Epstein through Ghislaine Maxwell, claimed that she was one of many vulnerable girls and young women who had been sexually exploited by Epstein and his circle of wealthy connections.The powerful friends were claimed to include Prince Andrew and the extract published in the Guardian gives her account of when they met in London in March 2001, when she was aged 17.She says the day began by being woken by Ghislaine Maxwell: \"It was going to be a special day, she said. Just like Cinderella, I was going to meet a handsome prince!\"When Andrew arrived later she claims that he was asked to guess her age. \"The Duke of York, who was then 41, guessed correctly: 17. 'My daughters are just a little younger than you,' he told me, explaining his accuracy. As usual, Maxwell was quick with a joke: 'I guess we will have to trade her in soon.',\" says her memoir.Like Epstein, she said she called him \"Andy\".There is also an account of the notorious photograph from that evening.\"My mom would never forgive me if I met someone as famous as Prince Andrew and didn't pose for a picture. \"I ran to get a Kodak FunSaver from my room, then returned and handed it to Epstein. I remember the prince putting his arm around my waist as Maxwell grinned beside me. Epstein snapped the photo,\" she writes.They went to dinner and then Tramp nightclub, she recalls, saying Andrew was a \"bumbling dancer, and I remember he sweated profusely\". \"On the way back, Maxwell told me, 'When we get home, you are to do for him what you do for Jeffrey'.\"She says of what happened next: \"He was friendly enough, but still entitled – as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright.\"As has been reported before, she claimed he was \"particularly attentive to my feet, caressing my toes and licking my arches\". And that later Epstein gave her $15,000 for her time with Andrew.Getty ImagesPrince Andrew has continued to face questions about links to EpsteinThe book also reports two other occasions on which she alleges she had sex with Andrew - in Epstein's townhouse in New York and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands.All three of the claimed meetings with Andrew have been reported in detail before, including in her previous witness statements and accounts, but this brings them together and provides her own perspective.\"Don't be fooled by those in Epstein's circle who say they didn't know what he was doing. Epstein not only didn't hide what was happening, he took a certain glee in making people watch,\" she writes.The book also reveals that she was taking tranquilisers to cope with her life working for Epstein.\"Sometimes, when I was really struggling, I took as many as eight Xanax a day,\" she writes.She also explained why she didn't leave \"Epstein's lair even after we knew what he wanted from us.\" \"How can you complain about being abused, some have asked, when you could so easily have stayed away? But that stance discounts what many of us had been through before we encountered Epstein, as well as how good he was at spotting girls whose wounds made them vulnerable,\" she writes.\"Several of us had been molested or raped as children; many of us were poor or even homeless. We were girls who no one cared about, and Epstein pretended to care.\"After leaving Epstein, Ms Giuffre had settled in Australia where she lived with her husband and three children. She took her own life at the age of 41.Epstein had killed himself in jail in New York in while awaiting trial. Ghislaine Maxwell was jailed on charges related to sex trafficking.Prince Andrew made a financial payment to Ms Giuffre in an out-of-court settlement, after she had brought a civil case against him, and he denies all the accusations made against him.He refutes Ms Giuffre's claims about having sex with him at the three locations: \"I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened,\" Andrew said in his BBC Newsnight interview.\"I can tell you categorically I don't remember meeting her at all. I do not remember a photograph being taken and I've said consistently and frequently that we never had any sort of sexual contact whatever,\" he said.Prince Andrew has faced challenges over aspects of his own account.He said he had cut all links with Epstein after seeing him in New York in December 2010, but an email later emerged from February 2011 which suggested Andrew was still in touch, with the promise to \"play some more soon\".The Duke of York's office has been contacted for comment.If you are suffering distress or despair, details of help and support in the UK are available at BBC Action Line.",

    "body": "18 minutes agoWedaeli Chibelushi andWycliffe MuiaNairobiHuge crowds of mourners in Kenya fled screaming after police fired gunshots and tear gas in a stadium where they had gathered to see the body of former Prime Minister Raila Odinga.Several people in the arena, located in the capital Nairobi, were reportedly injured in the chaos as security officers sought to disperse the surging crowds.It is not yet clear whether the police were using live ammunition or rubber bullets.Odinga's body was flown back from India, where he died on Wednesday morning, with thousands of people waiting at the airport. The public viewing finally began in the evening, after the chaos in the stadium had subsided.The throngs of people at the country's main airport forced the authorities to briefly suspend flights.The authorities said mourners had gained access to restricted areas, prompting a \"precautionary closure\" that lasted about two hours.From the airport, thousands of people moved in a procession to escort the vehicle carrying the body to the stadium, about 10km (six miles) from the city centre.Because of the unexpectedly large crowds, the public viewing ceremony for Odinga's body was moved to Nairobi's Moi International Sports Centre in the Kasarani neighbourhood, rather than inside the parliament building where it was initially scheduled to take place.The convoy arrived to a packed stadium, with more people waiting outside.Obituary: A founding father of Kenya's multi-party democracyHow Odinga's court challenges have improved Kenya's electionsMinutes afterwards, a large crowd breached a gate in the arena, prompting the police to fire tear gas. Masses of mourners rushed towards the exits in response.A BBC reporter at the scene also saw men in civilian clothing beating protesters with batons.At least three people were visibly injured and one had a serious head wound, the AFP news agency reported.After the chaos settled, dignitaries and government officials - including Kenyan President William Ruto - were able to observe the coffin, befopre the public viewing began.A stream of supporters had earlier gathered at Lee Funeral Home, where the body was first expected, and around parliament. \"I came here at six in the morning. We have been at the airport to welcome Baba [Odinga's nickname],\" one mourner had told the BBC near the airport.\"We are sad, we have been left as orphans. He is our father.\"Motorcycle rider William Otieno Adoyo said he was a \"Baba die-hard\".\"We want to see Baba, how do we know it's him in the casket? Let them show us and we'll be contented,\" he told the BBC.Mourners have been carrying twigs and palm branches, a symbol of mourning and grief among the Luo ethnic group that Odinga belonged to.The state funeral will be held at the Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi on Friday and on Saturday his body will be transported to Kisumu, a city in western Kenya on the shores of Lake Victoria - his political stronghold.Members of the public will get a chance to view the body before he is buried on Sunday at his farm in Bondo, about 60km west of Kisumu.According to the family, it was Odinga's wish to be laid to rest within the shortest time possible, ideally within 72 hours.The 80-year-old former prime minister collapsed during a morning walk in India on Wednesday morning and he was taken to Devamatha Hospital, about 50km (30 miles) east of the port city of Kochi.A seven-day period of mourning has been declared. Odinga will also be accorded a state funeral with full military honours, President Ruto said.He was towering figure in Kenyan politics and for many years was the country's main opposition leader, losing five presidential campaigns, most recently three years ago.Odinga repeatedly said he was cheated of victory, citing the manipulation of votes.Additional reporting by Akisa Wandera and Basillioh Rukanga in Nairobi",

    "body": "China arrested 30 Christians. Some fear it's the start of a bigger crackdown18 hours agoTessa WongAsia Digital Reporter andKelly NgReutersJin Mingri, seen here in a 2018 file photo, is one of 30 Christians arrested in China last weekendLast Friday Grace Jin Drexel received a text from her father in China, the prominent pastor Jin Mingri, telling her to pray for another pastor who had gone missing.The text said that the other pastor had been detained while visiting the southern  city of Shenzhen.\"Shortly after that, I got a call from my mum. She said she couldn't contact my dad,\" Ms Jin Drexel, who lives in the US, told the BBC. Within hours her family realised that Mr Jin had also been caught up in what has been described by activists as China's largest arrest of Christians in decades.Some now fear that last weekend's roundup of 30 Christians linked to the Zion Church network, which Mr Jin founded, marks the start of what could be a wider crackdown on underground churches.They point to new laws passed in China which appear aimed at curbing underground church activity, and increasing pressure exerted by authorities on church members in recent months.Despite being ruled by the atheist Chinese Communist Party, China has a sizeable Christian population. Government figures in recent years have stated there are about 38 million Protestants and nearly six million Catholics.But these figures likely only account for members of churches registered with the officially approved Catholic Patriotic Association and the Protestant Three-Self Patriotic Movement, which emphasise loyalty to China and the Communist Party.Rights activists and scholars estimate that tens of millions more Chinese attend unregistered churches, also known as house churches, which do not follow state-sanctioned ideologies.Many of these churches have been impacted by the Chinese government's attempts to increase its control of religious groups over the years. Church buildings have been demolished and crosses have been removed from public view, while religious material has become more tightly policed, with some Christian apps banned in China.In 2005 and again in 2018, the government revised and tightened regulations on religious groups, while in 2016, Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for the \"sinicisation\" of religion.Underground churches such as Zion were especially affected by the 2018 rules, which required government approval for worshipping in public. Many were forced to stop public activities and turned to holding online services, or simply shut down.The following years also saw the arrests and sentencing of a few prominent pastors.In recent months, there have been signs of Chinese authorities once again tightening the screws. In May, pastor Gao Quanfu of the Light of Zion Church in Xi'an was detained on charges of \"using superstitious activities to undermine the implementation of law\". The following month saw several members of the Linfen Golden Lampstand Church in Shanxi sentenced to years in prison for fraud, which rights groups have criticised as false convictions.Then in September, authorities announced a new online code of conduct for religious personnel, which only allows online sermons to be conducted by licensed groups. This has been widely seen as an attempt to curtail underground churches' online services.In the last few months, Zion church members have also faced increasing questioning by police officers, Ms Jin Drexel said.Many in Zion saw the stepped-up pressure as a prelude to a crackdown, but few anticipated it would be as large as it turned out to be, she said.Last Friday and Saturday, Chinese authorities launched what's been described as a sweeping crackdown across at least 10 cities, including Beijing and Shanghai. Besides Mr Jin who was taken from his main base in Beihai city in Guangxi province, they arrested other pastors, leaders and members of the congregation, according to the church.CSWPolice officers arresting pastor Sun Cong of Zion Church (centre) were seen going through his booksThe BBC has obtained a copy of what appears to be an official detention notice for Mr Jin, issued by the public security bureau in Beihai. It states that Mr Jin is currently held in the Beihai Number Two prison and that he is suspected of \"illegal use of information networks\".The BBC has asked local authorities to confirm the detention.Some of the arrested church members have since been released, but the majority are thought to still be in detention, with some housed in the same prison as Mr Jin.Corey Jackson, founder of Christian advocacy group Luke Alliance, said the nationwide scale and co-ordination of the arrests across China were unprecedented.\"We anticipate that this is just the beginning of a larger crackdown,\" he said, adding that other underground churches in China were now preparing themselves for arrests.Another Christian advocacy group, Open Doors, said the arrests were significant. \"Zion Church was very well known and outspoken and it may have reached the level of organisation that authorities are getting nervous about organised social entities they do not control,\" a spokesperson said.He warned that China's \"policy of acting against house churches will continue\" and that authorities may accuse more church members of fraud and economic crimes \"as a strategy of intimidation\".Sean Long, a Zion Church pastor and spokesperson based in the US, said other churches will be targeted as there is \"a new wave of religious persecution emerging quickly across China\".He called the latest arrests a \"systematic roundup\" to \"unroot Zion\", and quoted the Chinese idiom \"killing the chicken to scare the monkeys\".\"Zion is the chicken, we are the most influential... it's to scare other Christians and house churches in China.\"When asked by the BBC for a response, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in London said: \"We would like to stress that the Chinese citizens enjoy freedom of religious belief in accordance with law. Meanwhile, all religious groups and religious activities must comply with the laws and regulations of China.\"Earlier this week, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said it \"firmly opposes the US interfering in China's internal affairs with so-called religious issues\", in response to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's condemnation of the Zion church arrests.Getty ImagesChina officially has 38 million Protestants and six million Catholics, but tens of millions more Chinese are believed to attend underground churchesZion's story began with Jin Mingri, also known as Ezra Jin. Born in 1969 during the Cultural Revolution in the north-eastern province of Heilongjiang, he was a believer in the Chinese state while growing up.That changed in 1989 when, as a student in the prestigious Beijing University, he began taking part in the pro-democracy movement that was eventually crushed in the Tiananmen Massacre.While he did not happen to be at Tiananmen on 4 June, the events at the square changed his life. \"It was a pivotal moment. For his whole life, he had faith in the state. When that was betrayed, it shattered his entire world view. It was a big come-to-Jesus moment,\" Ms Jin Drexel said.At first Mr Jin pursued his new Christian faith at a Three-Self church. In 2002 he moved to the US with his wife and daughter to study at a seminary in California, where his two sons were born.The family moved back to China in 2007 for Mr Jin to continue his work. But he decided to set up an independent church,  said Ms Jin Drexel, as he could no longer accept the Three-Self doctrine which calls for allegiance to the Chinese state. \"He couldn't be a pastor there as it was not a God-pleasing church... you can't serve two masters.\"Zion began as a small house church in Beijing with just 20 followers. But over the years it expanded and began holding services in a large hall in an office building. As it grew in influence, so did the scrutiny. In 2018, Chinese authorities asked the church to install CCTV cameras in the building, saying it was for \"security\". When it refused, followers began facing what church leaders say was harassment. Later that year, the church was shut down.An exit ban was imposed on Mr Jin, who was placed under close surveillance. His family was able to leave for the US, as did some other church members such as Mr Long.Zion then pivoted to what Mr Long called a \"hybrid model\" where they would hold large online church services coupled with small offline meetings in person. The church grew to about 100 branches across 40 cities in China, and has more than 10,000 followers now.It is why, while the fate of Mr Jin and the other arrested church members remains uncertain and the possibility of a wider crackdown looms, Mr Long is confident that Zion and China's underground churches will survive.\"Persecution cannot destroy the church,\" he said. \"If you look back to history, where there is repression, there's a revival.\"Read more of our China coverage",

    "body": "2 days agoPaul MellyWest Africa analystAFP via Getty ImagesSpain is kicking against the prevailing political mood among Western nations when it comes to migration and policies regarding the African continent.At a time when the US, the UK, France and Germany are all cutting back their development aid budgets, Madrid remains committed to continued expansion, albeit from a lower starting point.This week, the Spanish capital has been hosting an African Union-backed \"world conference on people of African descent\". AfroMadrid2025 will discuss restorative justice and the creation of a new development fund.It is just the latest sign of how Spain's socialist-led government is seeking to deepen and diversify its engagement with the continent and near neighbour that lies just a few kilometres to the south, across the Straits of Gibraltar.In July Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares launched a new advisory council of prominent intellectual, diplomatic and cultural figures, more than half of them African, to monitor the delivery of the detailed Spain-Africa strategy that his government published at the end of last year.New embassies south of the Sahara, and partnerships in business and education are planned.The contrast between Spain's approach and that of others in the West is not just in spending but in tone and mindset – and nowhere more so than in dealing with migration.Similar to elsewhere in Europe, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is looking for ways to contain the influx of irregular arrivals.Like other centre-left and centre-right leaders, he finds himself facing an electoral challenge from the radical right, largely driven by some voters' concern over migration, with the hardline Vox party well established in parliament and routinely ranking third in opinion polls.In July, extra security forces had to be deployed against racist gangs roaming the streets of Torre Pacheco, in Murcia region – where many Africans work in the booming horticultural sector – after three Moroccans were accused of beating a pensioner.While the opposition conservative People's Party remains favourable to some immigration, but for cultural reasons wants to prioritise Latin Americans rather than Africans, Vox has been more radical.Responding to the Murcia incident Vox called for a crackdown on immigrants taking up less skilled jobs. The message largely targeted Africans working in fruit and vegetable production, now so crucial to the southern Spanish economy.But for the government the migration presents challenges that are as much practical as political.AFP via Getty ImagesThousands try to make the crossing to the Canary Islands on packed wooden boatsMore than 45,000 people made the perilous sea crossing from Africa's west coast to the Spanish archipelago of the Canary Islands last year. Estimates of those who died while making the attempt range between 1,400 and a staggering 10,460.Others make the shorter journey across the Gibraltar Straits or the Mediterranean to land on Andalusian beaches or try to scramble over the border fences of Ceuta and Melilla, the two Spanish enclave towns on the North African coast.The Spanish administration has to accommodate new arrivals, process their claims and manage their absorption into wider society, whether temporary or more long-lasting.However, in language markedly different from the hostile messaging that emanates from many European capitals, the Sanchez government openly acknowledges the hard economic realities on the ground in West Africa that push people to risk their lives in the effort to reach Europe.And it is trying to move beyond simply saying \"no\" to new arrivals. Instead, it is developing creative alternatives, with a promise to foster movements of people that are safe, orderly and regular and \"mutually beneficial\".On his trip to Mauritania last year, Sanchez stressed the contribution that migrants make to the Spanish economy.\"For us, the migratory phenomenon is not only a question of moral principles, solidarity and dignity, but also one of rationality,\" the prime minister said.The Spanish government funds training schemes for unemployed youth in countries such as Senegal, especially for irregular migrants who have been sent back, to help them develop viable new livelihoods back home.And it has expanded a \"circular migration\" programme that gives West Africans short-term visas to come to Spain for limited periods of seasonal work, mainly in agriculture, and then return.These issues were at the heart of the agenda when Sanchez visited Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania in August last year.A circular migration agreement with the former had been in place since 2021, but similar accords with the Mauritanian and Gambian governments have since followed.The underlying case for this singular approach was set out in detail in the foreign ministry's Spain-Africa strategy. This argued that Europe and Africa \"form part of the same geopolitical space\".But the management of migration is only one motive for the Spanish decision to place emphasis on building relations with Africa – and indeed support a much broader related social-cultural agenda.AFP via Getty ImagesSpain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez (R) met Mauritania's President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani (L) in Madrid last yearThe fundamental premise underlying Madrid's outreach is that Spain, as the European country closest to the continent, has an essential self interest in Africa's progress towards inclusive and sustainable development, and peace and security.That basic rationale might seem obvious.Yet of course history had taken Spain down a quite different path.Other than a few Maghreb footholds and a small tropical outpost – today's independent Equatorial Guinea – its colonial expansion in the 16th and 17th Centuries had mainly been directed across the Atlantic.And over recent decades, European affairs and the Middle East had tended to dominate Madrid's foreign policy priorities, while the main beneficiaries of its development support were the countries of its vast former empire in Central and South America.However, the past few years have seen the Sanchez government preside over a fundamental broadening of outlook.Barely had Albares been installed as foreign minister in July 2021 than he launched a restructuring of his department, in part to strengthen its engagement not only with Latin America but also with the Sahel and North Africa.Confirmation of the wider geographical emphasis came with a development co-operation plan for 2024-27, which for the first time, designated West Africa, including the Sahel, as one of three regions prioritised for assistance, alongside Central and South America.Spain's Africa strategy lays heavy emphasis not just on economic sectors such as infrastructure, digitalisation and energy transition but also particularly on education and youth employment.The cultural dimension includes not only promotion of the Spanish language, with an expanded presence of the Cervantes Institute, but also programmes to help the mobility of academic teachers and researchers.Security co-operation, action on climate change, women's empowerment and an expanded diplomatic presence are unsurprising components in today's environment.However, the strategy also lays very public stress it places on supporting democratic ideas, the African Union and, in particular, the West African regional organisation Ecowas.This will be welcome public encouragement for the latter, which is currently under severe pressure after seeing its 50th anniversary year marred by the walk-out of the Sahelian states – Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger – whose ruling military juntas have refused to comply with its protocol on democracy and good governance.Meanwhile, in a message targeted as much at Madrid's domestic audience as its sub-Saharan partners, the foreign ministry said \"supporting the African diaspora and the fight against racism and xenophobia are also key priorities\".Fine words of course are only a first step. But in today's sour international climate such language really does stand out.Paul Melly is a consulting fellow with the Africa Programme at Chatham House in London.You may also be interested in:Spain looks to immigrants to drive economy'Try or die' - one man's determination to get to the Canary Islands'I found out on social media that my son had died'Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

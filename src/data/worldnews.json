    "body": "3 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterSinger Julio Iglesias has denied allegations of sexual assault made by two female former employees.The women allege that the 82-year-old Spanish superstar \"normalised abuse\" in a coercive, threatening and violent environment while they were working at his properties in the Bahamas and Dominican Republic.Responding on Instagram, Iglesias said: \"I deny having abused, coerced, or disrespected any woman. These accusations are absolutely false and deeply sadden me.\"The allegations, which were first reported earlier this week, are being investigated by Spain's judiciary.The two women - a domestic worker and a physiotherapist - have alleged they suffered sexual and other forms of abuse while working at Iglesias's properties.The reports said they worked in his Caribbean residences for 10 months in 2021, which is when they allege the sexual assaults took place.On 5 January, the women filed a legal complaint for sexual assault and human trafficking with the national court, which investigates crimes allegedly committed beyond Spain's borders.Advocacy groups Women's Link Worldwide and Amnesty International said the acts alleged in the complaint could be considered \"a crime of human trafficking for the purpose of forced labour\" and \"crimes against sexual freedom\".According to testimony collected by the two groups, Iglesias subjected the women to \"sexual harassment, regularly checked their mobile phones, restricted their ability to leave the home where they worked, and required them to work up to 16 hours a day without days off\".Women's Link described the complainants as young Latin American women \"in vulnerable situations who were heavily dependent on their wages due to their economic and social conditions\".In his Instagram statement, Iglesias wrote: \"It is with profound sadness that I respond to the accusations made by two people who previously worked for me.He added: \"I have never felt such malice, but I still have the strength to let people know the whole truth and defend my dignity against such a serious accusation.\"The singer also thanked the \"so many dear people who have sent me messages of affection and loyalty\", adding: \"I have found great comfort in them.\"According to by Spanish news site elDiario.es and US outlet Univision, which investigated the claims over three years, the women's allegations are backed up by documentary evidence including photographs, phone records, text messages and medical reports.Their reports cite other former employees who describe a threatening, highly stressful atmosphere for those working for Iglesias.But an old friend of the singer, Jaime Peñafiel, labelled the accusations \"absolute lies\", while another ally, journalist Miguel Ángel Pastor, said he had never heard \"any suggestion that he might have committed this kind of act\".Iglesias is one of the most successful Latin artists of all time, having sold more than 300 million records in a career spanning decades.He is also the father of fellow music superstar Enrique Iglesias.",

    "body": "Families of people killed in the protests in Iran have told the BBC that the authorities are demanding large sums of money to return their bodies for burial. Multiple sources have told BBC Persian that bodies are being held in mortuaries and hospitals and that security forces will not release them unless their relatives hand over money. At least 2,435 people have been killed during more than two weeks of protests across the country.  One family in the northern city of Rasht told the BBC that security forces demanded 700 million tomans ($5,000; £3,700) to release the body of their loved one. It was being held at the Poursina Hospital mortuary, along with at least 70 other dead protesters, they said. Meanwhile in Tehran, the family of a Kurdish seasonal construction worker went to collect his body, only to be told they must pay a billion tomans ($7,000; £5,200) to receive it. The family told the BBC that they could not afford the fee and were forced to leave without their son's body. A construction worker in Iran typically earns less than $100 a month. In some cases, hospital staff have phoned the relatives of the dead to give them an advance warning to come and get the bodies before security forces can extort any funds. BBC Persian has been told about a woman - who we are not identifying for her safety - who did not know her husband was killed until she received a phone call on 9 January on his phone from hospital staff. They told her she should quickly come and collect his body before security forces arrived and demanded payment for its release. BBC Persian was told about this situation by a London-based relative, who has spoken to her. The woman then took her two children to the hospital to find her husband's body.  She put it in the back of a pickup truck, and drove for seven hours to their hometown in western Iran to bury him. \"I rode in the back of the pickup truck, crying over his body for seven hours while my children sat in the front seat,\" she told her London relative. BBC Persian has also received reports that officials at Tehran's Behesht-e Zahra mortuary are telling families that if they claim their child was a member of the Basij paramilitary force and was killed by protesters, the body will be released without charge.The family member told the BBC in a message: \"We were asked to participate in a pro-government rally and portray the body as that of a martyr. We did not agree to this.\"In another case in Tehran, a source told BBC Persian that several families broke into a mortuary to retrieve bodies out of fear they would be taken away by the authorities. \"Several families, fearing that the authorities might keep the bodies or bury them without their knowledge, broke open the morgue door and pulled the bodies out of  ambulances,\" the source told the BBC. The families then guarded the bodies for several hours on the ground in the hospital courtyard to prevent them from being taken away until they could find private ambulances to transport them, the source said. An internet and communications blackout has made it difficult to get a full picture of what is happening on the ground. International human-rights groups have no direct access to the country and, along with other international news organisations, the BBC is not allowed by the Iranian government to report on the ground.Demonstrations began in the capital, Tehran, on 29 December, following a sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the dollar. As the protests reached dozens of other towns and cities, they turned against Iran's clerical rulers and security forces launched a violent crackdown. The protests escalated significantly last Thursday and were met with deadly force by authorities. According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), at least 2,435 protesters have been killed since the unrest began, as well as 13 children and 153 people affiliated with the security forces or government. It reports that another 18,470 protesters have been arrested.Meanwhile, arrests have continued across the country. Security forces and Revolutionary Guard intelligence units have detained activists, lawyers, and ordinary citizens. Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "6 hours agoJake Kwon,Seoul correspondentandLeehyun Choi,SeoulEPA/ShutterstockYoon was impeached in 2024 for his martial law attemptSouth Korea's impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol will be jailed for five years over abuse of power, obstructing justice and falsifying documents in relation to his failed martial law bid in 2024.This is the first of the verdicts in four trials linked to his shock martial law decree. Although short-lived, the move triggered nationwide turmoil, sparking protests as MPs rushed to the national assembly to overturn Yoon's decision.  Yoon's actions \"plunged the country into political crisis\", a judge said on Friday, noting that Yoon had \"consistently shown no remorse\".Friday's ruling offers clues as to how the rest of Yoon's trials could go. His string of charges range from abuse of power to campaign law violations. The most serious charge is insurrection, for which prosecutors have demanded the death penalty. The verdict in that trial is expected in February.About 100 supporters of Yoon had gathered outside the courthouse on Friday to watch the livestreamed proceedings projected on a large screen.Some of them held red banners that read: \"Yoon, again! Make Korea great again\". Several could be heard yelling at the judge as he delivered the guilty verdicts, while others looked solemn.On Friday, Yoon was convicted of using presidential bodyguards to prevent his arrest; failing to consult his entire cabinet before declaring martial law; as well as drafting and then destroying a falsified document claiming the martial law bid had been endorsed by the prime minister and defence minister.\"The accused has the duty to safeguard the constitution and law but turned his back on them,\" the judge said. Prosecutors had sought a 10-year jail term for the charges in Friday's ruling. Both sides have seven days to appeal.About 100 supporters of Yoon had gathered outside the courthouse on FridayYoon denied the charges, arguing that the arrest warrant itself was invalid and that the letter of the law does not require him to consult every member of the cabinet before exercising emergency power.He had claimed across his trials that investigators had no legal basis to probe and arrest him in the first place. Most of the accusations against him are invalid because there was no procedural lapse when he declared martial law, he argues.South Korea's courts often grant leniency when the accused accepts guilt or responsibility. But prosecutors argue that Yoon's lack of remorse is grounds for an even more severe penalty.Park Geun-hye, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for abuse of power and bribery in 2021, was the last former president to be jailed for a criminal charge. But she was pardoned and released from prison shortly after.Six months after Yoon's martial law attempt, voters elected opposition leader Lee Jae Myung in a decisive victory . But Yoon's trials bring the spotlight back to deep divisions in South Korea, where the former president  retains strong supporters who see him as a martyr. According to a survey conducted last December, nearly 30% of South Koreans did not believe that Yoon's martial law declaration amounted to an insurrection.While his martial law attempt brought tens of thousands of protesters onto the streets, it also saw his supporters show up in counter protests, though in smaller numbers.

    "body": "In the middle of the night on Monday, Rachel Bloor stirred in her bed to find a heavy weight curled up on her chest.Half asleep, she reached out for her dog - and instead found herself petting a smooth, slithering object.As Bloor retreated further under the covers and pulled them up to her neck, her partner switched on the bedside lamp and confirmed the Brisbane couple's fears.\"He goes, 'Oh baby. Don't move. There's like a 2.5m python on you,\" Bloor told the BBC.Her first words were expletives. The second, an order to evacuate the dogs.\"I thought if my Dalmatian realises that there's a snake there... it's gonna be carnage.\"The dogs secured outside the room - and her husband wishing he was with them - Bloor began carefully extricating herself.\"I was just trying to shimmy out from under the covers... in my mind, going, 'Is this really happening? This is so bizarre'.\"She believes the carpet python - which is non-venomous - had squeezed itself through the shutters on her window and onto her bed below.Once freed from the python, she began casually feeding it back out the way it came in.\"It was that big that even though it had been curled up on me, part of its tail was still out the shutter.\"\"I grabbed him, [and] even then he didn't seem overly freaked out. He sort of just wobbled in my hand.\"The same couldn't be said for her stunned husband, but Bloor herself was barely fazed, having grown up on acreage around snakes.\"I think if you're calm, they're calm.\"Though if it had been a cane toad - one of the country's most damaging, and ugly pests - that would be another story, she said.\"I can't stand them, like they make me dry retch. So if it was a cane toad, it would have scared me.\"All animals and humans escaped from the interaction unharmed.Carpet pythons are constrictors that are common in coastal areas of Australia, and usually eat small animals such as birds.",

    "body": "10 minutes agoNatasha Booty,Andrew OchiengandPumza Filhani,JohannesburgFlooding in South Africa's northern provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga has forced the famed Kruger National Park to suspend visits and evacuate some guests and staff by helicopter.At least 19 people are now believed to have died in recent weeks in South Africa after torrential rain led to floods that have destroyed dozens of homes.Among those killed was a five-year-old boy in the town of Giyani, in Limpopo. President Cyril Ramaphosa met the child's family to offer his condolences while visiting the region to assess the damage.A red level 10 warning has been issued by the South African Weather Service, forecasting yet more rain in affected areas and warning communities to remain alert.\"If possible stay indoors and off the roads,\" it advises. \"Never drive on a road covered by water. If the vehicle stalls, leave it immediately and seek higher ground.\"Residents are also advised to move their valuables to a \"safe place above the expected flood level\", switch off their electricity at the source, and to move livestock to higher ground.Wildlife in the national parks are not thought to be at high risk because they tend to instinctively seek out higher land when necessary, rangers say.In recent days helicopters and the military have been deployed to rescue people in some of the worst-affected areas.In Limpopo, low-lying bridges have been washed away and some roads destroyed.Within the Kruger National Park, staff accommodation was submerged by water overnight and workers were evacuated to safety.The Reuters news agency reports that flooding in south-eastern Africa has become more frequent and severe as climate change makes storms in the adjacent Indian Ocean more powerful.",

    "body": "8 minutes agoLaura Bicker,Beijing ,Suranjana Tewari,Singapore ,Koh Ewe,SingaporeandJessica Murphy,TorontoReutersMark Carney's visit to Chins is the first by a Canadian leader in nearly a decadeChinese leader Xi Jinping and Canadian PM Mark Carney have announced lower tariffs, signalling a reset in their countries' relationship after a key meeting in Beijing.China is expected to lower levies on Canadian canola oil from 85% to 15% by 1 March, while Ottawa has agreed to tax Chinese electric vehicles at the most-favoured-nation rate, 6.1%, Carney told reporters. The deal is a breakthrough after years of strained ties and tit-for-tat levies. Xi hailed the \"turnaround\" in their relationship but it is also a win for Carney, the first Canadian leader to visit China in nearly a decade.  He has been trying to diversify Canadian trade away from the US, his country's  biggest trading partner, following the uncertainty caused by Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs. The deal could also see more Chinese investments in Canada, right on America's doorstep. Carney himself seemed to allude to the fact that this was a result of Trump's tariffs, which have now pushed one of the US's key allies towards its biggest rival. He told reporters that Canada's relationship with China had been more \"predictable\" in recent month and that he found talks with Beijing \"realistic and respectful\".He also made clear Ottawa does not agree with Beijing on everything, adding that in his discussions with Xi he made clear Canada's \"red lines\", including human rights, concerns over election interference and the need for \"guardrails\".Observers believe Carney's visit could set an example for other countries across the world who are also feeling the pain from Washington's tariffs. In contrast, Xi has been trying to show that China is a stable global partner and has been urging more pragmatic ties - in the words of Beijing, \"a win-win\" for all.And it seems to be working. The South Korean president and the Irish prime minister have both visited Beijing in recent weeks. The UK prime minister is expected to visit soon and so is the German Chancellor.Carney said the \"world has changed dramatically\" and how Canada positions itself \"will shape our future for decades to come,\" he added. Earlier in his three-day visit, he had said that the Canada-China partnership sets the two countries up for a \"new world order\". He later added that the multilateral system had been \"eroded, to use a polite term, or undercut\". As the Chinese and Canadian delegations sat down in the Great Hall of the People on Friday, Xi said: \"The healthy and stable development of China-Canada relations is conducive to world peace, stability, development, and prosperity.\" Getty ImagesCarney in the Great Hall of the People during the meeting with Xi  A trade reset Tariffs have been a key sticking point between the two sides. In 2024, Canada imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, following similar US curbs.Last year, Beijing retaliated with tariffs on more than $2bn (£1.5bn) of Canadian farm and food products like canola seed and oil. As a result Chinese imports of Canadian goods fell by 10% in 2025.In the deal struck on Friday, Canada will allow only 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the Canadian market at the 6.1% tariff rate.The cap is in response to Canadian automakers' fears of an influx of affordable Chinese EVs.China is Canada's second-largest trading partner, recording more than C$118bn ($85bn; £63bn) in two-way merchandise trade in 2024. That's a long way behind the US, Canada's closest ally, which traded more than $761bn (£568bn) worth of goods with Ottawa in 2024.But economic ties with China are increasingly important for Carney, who said ahead of his visit that Canada was focused on building a \"more competitive, sustainable and independent economy\" in the face of \"global trade disruption\".Carney, who arrived in Beijing on Wednesday, met senior executives from prominent Chinese businesses, including an electric vehicle battery maker and an energy giant.On Thursday the two countries signed several agreements on energy and trade cooperation.The visit is a \"reset of a relationship\" that may be \"modest in ambition\" but \"much more realistic about what we can reasonably obtain\", said Colin Robertson, a former Canadian diplomat and vice-president at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute.A frosty history The last Canadian PM to visit China was Justin Trudeau, who met Xi in Beijing in 2017.That visit took place before the relationship soured in 2018, following Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer  at the Chinese tech giant Huawai, at the request of the US.Days later, China detained Canadian citizens Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor on espionage charges - a move critics saw as retaliation for Meng's arrest, which China denied.Meng and both Michaels were released in 2021.Ahead of the Carney-Xi meeting, Michael Kovrig wrote on X that the visit should not just be about warming ties but also \"managing leverage\".Kovrig described Chinese negotiators as \"extremely adroit, calculating, and always looking for leverage\".\"That's why engagement has to be handled with discipline,\" he wrote, adding that Carney should also advocate for Canadians imprisoned in China. There are about 100 of them, according to Canadian media.Speaking to reporters, Carney was clear that with countries that do not share the same values, Ottawa will engage on a \"narrower, more specific\" manner.\"We're very clear about where we cooperate, where we differ,\" he said, adding that Chinese claims over self-governed Taiwan and Hong Kong's jailed pro-democracy figure Jimmy Lai came up in \"broad discussions\". Canada and China have \"different systems\", he said, which limits the breadth of their cooperation. \"But to have an effective relationship, we have direct conversations. We don't grab a megaphone and have the conversations that way.\"",

I am worried that he can't handle these pigs.\"Daidai, who's in her 20s, promised that those who came to their village, Qingfu, to assist would be treated to a pork banquet.In rural Sichuan and Chongqing, large community meals are an important part of culture, featuring twice-cooked pork, steamed ribs, soup and homemade liquor.\"Let me hold my head up high in our village,\" she said.Her appeal for help attracted more than a million likes and the response on the ground was like a scene from a cheesy feel-good movie, as thousands of cars poured in, carrying many more people than she needed for the task.So many responded that traffic jams have brought roads in this part of rural Chongqing in south-west China to a standstill. Drone images show carloads of people queuing up with rice crops on either side hoping to still enter Qingfu. Walking in from long distances has been a traffic-beating option for some.Daidai posted that drivers coming into the area should be careful on the roads, especially those from the city unaccustomed to conditions in the countryside.\"The atmosphere has been great. It reminded me of my childhood when my family still kept pigs. It has been years since I felt anything like that,\" one man, who drove more than 100 kilometres (65 miles) to get there, told the BBC.He has seen licence plates from all over the country, he said.When the pig slaughter and subsequent mass banquet did happen, it was watched live online by more than 100,000 viewers, registering 20 million likes, and the local government embraced it as a flash-tourism moment.With many more people in town than two pigs could feed, tourism officials donated more pigs to meet the huge demand, and small restaurants have been serving crowds of visitors in outdoor seating areas.Yet what this phenomenon has shown is how quickly a small matter can become something massive in the age of social media.\"I thought maybe a dozen people would come,\" Daidai told Chinese media. \"But there have been too many to count.\"The response has also been driven by what seems to be a yearning from Chinese people to get back in touch with community cultural events, as well as a need for positive experiences when life can, at times, seem very dark.Daidai couldn't believe how quickly it's all happened. Last Friday she posted her request for help. By Saturday the response was so large that she went to the police to warn them that there could be disruption in the village and extra officers were brought in to manage the situation.The banquet celebration, by then huge in size, went on for two days – 1,000 diners on 11 January became 2,000 the next day – with bonfires into the night and much partying, accompanied by a band.Eventually, Daidai posted that her celebration was over, urging any more visitors to enjoy the region but not visit her home. After sleeping for only four hours over two days, she said she was exhausted.However, it had been an incredible moment for her and her village.To all the strangers who answered her call she said, \"without your enthusiasm and passion, there would not have been a feast like this\".\"For everyone who came, the feeling was like that of a big family. It was really warm, really healing and really meaningful.\"She thanked government officials and the police for allowing a sudden celebration of this size to proceed.It is already being predicted that the now famous Hechuan region, where her village is located, may try to turn this into a regular event, to tap into the enthusiasm for genuine, grass-roots interaction in a world where many feel isolated and removed from their culture.One villager was quoted in the People's Daily as saying: \"Here neighbours help each other. Today I might help you slaughter a pig at your place, tomorrow you will come to my place to do the same.\"As for Daidai's father, she said in an interview: \"My dad is very happy. Seeing this many people arrive he had to borrow tables and chairs from other villagers. We've never experienced anything like this.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoWill GrantBBC's Cuba correspondent in HavanaWatch: Public pay their respects to Cubans killed in Venezuela during US raidFrom sunrise, throngs of military personnel, government officials and civilians lined the route between Havana's airport and the Armed Forces Ministry to applaud home the remains of 32 Cuban troops killed in Venezuela as they passed by in a funeral cortege.The country's leadership – from Raul Castro to President Miguel Diaz Canel – were at the airport to receive the boxes carrying the cremated ashes of their \"32 fallen heroes\".In the lobby of the ministry building, each box was draped in a Cuban flag and set next to a photograph of the respective soldier or intelligence officer beneath the words \"honour and glory\".But despite the pomp and full military honours, this has been a chastening experience for the Cuban Revolution.First, it is believed to be the biggest loss of Cuban combatants at the hands of the US military since the Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961. The fact that six-and-a-half decades have passed with barely a comparable firefight between Cuban and US troops, either during the Cold War or afterwards, shows how rare it is.It is not necessarily surprising that the better-trained and better-equipped Delta Force soldiers emerged virtually unscathed, especially given their elite reputation within the most powerful military in the world.Getty ImagesSome 32 Cubans were killed during the US military invention in VenezuelaBut that is of no comfort to the grieving family members as they tearfully placed their hands on the wooden boxes in Havana.Furthermore, in the days after the US military intervention in Venezuela and the forced removal of Nicolas Maduro from power, the Cuban Government was obliged to admit something it had long denied: the very existence of Cuban intelligence officers inside the corridors of power in Caracas.It is now clear, as it had been claimed for years by many in Venezuela, that Cubans have been present at every level of the country's security apparatus and that the bilateral intelligence arrangements were a crucial part of Cuba-Venezuela ties.In short, the Cuban Government has shared its years of experience of how best to maintain an iron grip on power with its Venezuelan partners. The 32 killed on Venezuelan soil were part of that shared strategy.In the wake of their deaths, though, Cubans can feel the sands shifting beneath their feet. A day earlier, Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, held a phone call with President Trump, after which he described her as \"a terrific person\".Rewind the clock just three weeks and it would have been almost unthinkable to hear such praise from the same administration who painted her predecessor as running an entire regime of \"narco-terrorists.\"It seems the Rodriguez and the Trump administrations are finding a modus vivendi. But few in the Cuban government seem to yet understand where that will leave them or their shared vision of state-run socialism with Venezuela.Washington insists the days are numbered for the Cuban Revolution.However, one of its \"original generation\" disagrees. At 88 years old, Victor Dreke is a contemporary of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, and says the current conflict with the US has echoes of the CIA-backed invasion at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961.He led two companies of Cuban troops that day and argues that Cubans would still repel any repeat attempt:\"If the US tries to invade, they'll stir up a hornets' nest\" he said, quoting Raul Castro. \"They'd never even see our combatants coming, men and women.\"\"If the Americans put a single foot on Cuban soil, it won't be like their cowardly ambush of our combatants in Venezuela\", he says. \"Out here, things would be very different.\"Victor Dreke is a contemporary of Fidel Castro and Che GuevaraIn the past few days, Cuban state television has shown images of civilian reservists receiving weapons training from the Cuban military.In truth, pitted against the US military, it would be an uneven fight. The US attack on Venezuela was intended, in part, to underscore that point to the region.The stakes for Cuba are particularly high.The island is experiencing widespread blackouts which are bad in Havana but much worse in the provinces. The economy, battered by the US economic embargo and by government mismanagement, is limping along at best. Fuel is scarce and the motor of the economy, tourism, has never recovered to its pre-pandemic levels.It's into that already-complex picture that Cubans are trying to imagine the near total loss of Venezuelan support. It feels to most like a bleak scenario.But former-commander, Victor Dreke, is adamant that Cuba has ridden out tough times before and can do so again with enough revolutionary fervour.Cuba doesn't want any conflict with Trump administration, he insists, and won't be looking to escalate matters with Washington.\"But that doesn't mean we won't be ready\", he adds, defiantly.",

    "body": "12 hours agoNardine Saad and Christal HayesLos AngelesActor Timothy Busfield has made his first court appearance after turning himself in on criminal charges that he allegedly sexually abused two boys on the set of a TV series filmed in New Mexico, prosecutors say.The Emmy-winning actor, who starred in Thirtysomething and The West Wing, was taken into custody in Albuquerque on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse that police allege happened on the set of Fox's crime drama The Cleaning Lady.Busfield, 68, strenuously denied the allegations through his lawyer.\"The claims being made against Tim are completely false, and we will fight this to the end until the truth prevails,\" the lawyer, Stanton \"Larry\" Stein, said.Stein said the actor, who is also known for his roles in the baseball film Field of Dreams and the comedy thriller Revenge of the Nerds, was being accused as an act of revenge after the children had been terminated from the series, which angered their mother. During a media conference on Thursday, Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman said that Busfield made an initial court appearance on Wednesday and a judge ordered that he remain in custody. The case is now being transferred to district court and a hearing has been set for 20 January to determine whether Busfield should be released on bail pending trial.\"Our priority is to protect the rights of everyone involved,\" Bregman said at the news conference, urging anyone with information to contact law enforcement.In a warrant for Busfield's arrest, prosecutors say the parents of boys allege that Busfield groomed and sexually abused the youngsters while working on set for The Cleaning Lady, which Busfield both directs and executive produces. It airs on Fox in the US. In an affidavit supporting his arrest warrant, authorities claim the boys referred to Busfield as \"Uncle Tim\" and alleged that he \"would tickle them on the stomach and legs\". Both boys told authorities they were touched inappropriately for years, the arrest affidavit states. One of the boys alleged that Busfield touched his private areas, according to court documents. The boy told authorities that the alleged inappropriate touching started when he was 7 years old and he was scared to speak out because he \"feared\" that Busfield would \"get mad at him\". The documents state that the boy had suffered nightmares and was having troubles wetting the bed since the alleged encounters. He has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety, authorities say in the court documents. Before he turned himself in, Busfield appeared in a video provided to TMZ saying that he was contacted on Friday night about getting a lawyer. The next day he drove 2,000 miles (3,200 km) to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to surrender to authorities.\"They're all lies and I did not do anything to those little boys and I'm gonna fight it. I'm gonna fight it with a great team, and I'm gonna be exonerated, I know I am, because this is all so wrong and all lies,\" he said in the video.His lawyer says the case stems from wanting revenge. Busfield told authorities that the boys' mother had threatened revenge when they were replaced on the series, the arrest affidavit states. \"As reflected in the criminal complaint, after her son was terminated from the show, the boy's mother vowed to 'get her revenge against Timothy Busfield.' What followed appears to be a calculated effort to construct a case, driven by animus not fact, despite prior investigations finding no evidence of wrongdoing,\" Stein said.Stein added that an investigation opened by Warner Bros about the allegations was closed after they could not find \"corroborating evidence that Mr Busfield engaged in inappropriate conduct or that he was ever alone\" with the boys. Court documents show that after authorities got a warrant for his arrest, another accusation surfaced alleging Busfield kissed and groped a 16-year-old girl.Prosecutors noted the new allegation in a motion asking that a judge keep Busfield from being released from jail immediately, alleging the actor has a \"documented pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse of authority and grooming behavior\". In that court document, prosecutors said the girl's father had come forward on Tuesday with allegations that the teen had been sexually abused by Busfield in California \"several years ago\" at the B-Street Theatre, which the actor co-founded in Sacramento.The father alleged to authorities that the encounter happened when the girl was auditioning at the theatre and the actor allegedly kissed her and touched her sexually, the court document states. Court documents state that the father alleged that the actor \"begged the family to not report to law enforcement\" and agreed to go to therapy. Busfield's lawyer told the BBC that the actor denies all the allegations and \"maintains that they are completely false\". When asked about the additional accusation surfacing, Stein said Busfield had volunteered to do a polygraph test and had passed it. The lawyer did not provide further details on the test. Busfield has previously been accused of sexual assault by two women in the 1990s and in 2012, which prosecutors pointed to in court documents. The Cleaning Lady producer Warner Bros Television and Fox said that they were aware of the charges against Busfield and would work with law enforcement. They told the Los Angeles Times that they prioritise the health and safety of their cast and crew.A spokesperson for Busfield's wife Melissa Gilbert, who starred in the series Little House on the Prairie, told the BBC that she would not make public statements and pushed back against fake comments circulating online that claim to have come from her. \"She is honoring the request of Tim's lawyers not to speak publicly while the legal process unfolds,\" her publicist Ame Van Iden said. \"During this period, her focus is on supporting and caring for their very large family, as they navigate this moment. Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time. We ask that their privacy be respected.\"Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. Sign up here.",

    "body": "Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni has taken a strong lead in partial results from Thursday's presidential election, the electoral commission says.Figures announced on Friday morning put Museveni in front with 76% of the votes, based on returns from 45% of the country's polling stations.He is followed by opposition leader Bobi Wine with 20%. Security forces have surrounded Wine's home in the capital, Kampala, \"effectively placing him and his wife under house arrest\", his party said. \"Security officers have unlawfully jumped over the perimeter fence and are now erecting tents within his compound,\" the National Unity Platform (NUP) party posted on X late on Thursday. Police spokesman Kituuma Rusoke told local broadcaster NBS that as a presidential contestant, Wine was \"a person of interest\",  adding that the heavy security deployment around his home was for his own security.Some local journalists said security forces had blocked them from accessing the opposition leader's home in Kampala's Magere area. Following the 2021 election, in which he garnered 35% of the vote, Wine was confined to his home for several days by security forces. Electoral chief Simon Byabakama said on Friday that the vote counting had not been affected by the internet blackout imposed earlier in the week, as the commission was using a \"private system\" to transmit results from districts to the national tally centre.Asked about the timing of the final results announcement, Byabakama said: \"We are on course to announce the winner of the presidential election within 48 hours. Before 5 PM [14:00 GMT] tomorrow, we shall have the final results.\"Ugandans voted in a tense national election on Thursday after an often violent campaign, with President Museveni, 81, seeking a seventh term in office. Wine, a 43-year-old pop star-turned-politician, has alleged \"massive\" fraud during the election, which was held under an internet blackout.  He did not provide documentary proof and the authorities have not responded to his allegations. Last week, the United Nation's Human Rights Office said that the election would be marked by \"widespread repression and intimidation\". During Thursday's vote, voting was delayed by up to four hours in many polling stations around the country as ballot boxes were slow to arrive and biometric machines, used to verify voters' identity, did not work properly. Some have linked the problems to the network outage. Although there are other six candidates, the presidential poll is essentially a two-horse race between Museveni and Wine, but given the president has won the six previous elections, analysts say he is likely to further extend his time in power.Wine, who says he represents the youth in a country where most of the population is aged under 30, has promised to tackle corruption and impose sweeping reforms, while Museveni argues he is the sole guarantor of stability and progress in the country.The campaign period was marred by the disruption of opposition activities - security forces have been accused of assaulting and detaining Wine's supporters.Police spokesperson Kituuma Rusoke dismissed these complaints, accusing opposition supporters of being disruptive.Internet access was suspended on Tuesday, with Uganda's Communications Commission saying the blackout was necessary to prevent misinformation, fraud and the incitement of violence - a move condemned by the UN human rights office as \"deeply worrying\".Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, had called on his supporters to protest, if Thursday's election results were manipulated.However, as of Friday morning, there have been no signs of any demonstrations. A Museveni victory would extend the former rebel leader's four-decade grip on power. He is widely believed to favour his son, military chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba, as his successor, though he denies grooming him for the role.The final presidential result is expected be announced by 16:00 local time (13:00 GMT) on Saturday, according to the electoral commission.

    "body": "6 hours agoLeehyun Choi,SeoulandKelly NgGetty ImagesThis verdict comes more than a year after Yoon's short-lived martial law decreeSouth Korea's beleaguered ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol has been found guilty of abuse of power, falsifying documents and obstructing justice when he tried and failed to impose martial law in the country in 2024. He has also been sentenced to five years in jail.Yoon is facing three other trials for charges ranging from insurrection to violating campaign law. The verdict comes more than a year after his short-lived decree threw South Korea into political turmoil, leaving it deeply divided.Here's what to know about the key charges laid against Yoon.Obstruction of justiceOn Friday, Yoon was found guilty of obstruction of justice by evading arrest; abuse of power by not convening a cabinet meeting before his martial law declaration; and falsifying official documents.Prosecutors accused him of using state institutions \"for personal purposes\" to conceal wrongdoing and undermine constitutional checks and balances.In January last year, it took some 3,000 police officers, over two attempts, to finally take Yoon into custody for questioning over the insurrection charge.Yoon had mobilised a large group of security officers who formed a human wall inside his residence to block the arrest - a move that a special prosecutor investigating the charge said was unprecedented.Yoon, meanwhile, argued the Corruption Investigation Office that attempted to arrest him lacked jurisdiction to investigate insurrection charges.The chaos surrounding the arrest, and the earlier failed attempt, \"demonstrated apparent lawlessness by Yoon, [his] conservative party, and South Korea's domestic security institutions\", said Mason Richey, an associate professor at Seoul's Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.\"The obstruction of justice trial is a way to ensure accountability for these,\" he said.InsurrectionUnder South Korea's constitution, sitting presidents are immune from criminal persecution, except for on charges of insurrection and treason. Yoon was charged on 26 January 2025. By then, parliament had voted to impeach him, but he was not yet removed from office.Prosecutors allege that Yoon attempted to subvert the constitution by declaring martial law in the absence of war or any national emergency.In particular, he's been charged over how he mobilised troops and police to seal off the National Assembly compound to prevent lawmakers from blocking his decree, and how he ordered the arrests of the National Assembly speaker and then-leaders of the main political parties.Yoon had earlier claimed he declared martial law to protect the country from \"anti-state\" forces that sympathised with North Korea - but it soon became clear he was spurred by his own political troubles.Prosecutors have sought the death penalty, describing Yoon as \"unrepentant\".South Korea has not executed anyone since December 1997.AFP via Getty ImagesYoon's decree and the subsequent legal proceedings have prompted scores, both supporters and opponents, to take to the streetsFormer president Chun Doo-hwan, who ruled South Korea in the 1980s as a military dictator, was sentenced to death for leading an insurrection, though this was later reduced to life imprisonment. His ally and successor Roh Tae-woo was handed a lengthy jail term for his part in the insurrection. Both were eventually pardoned.Prosecutors have argued, however, that Yoon's 2024 martial law attempt \"tarnished the nation's dignity far more severely\" than the military coup Chun and Roh staged in 1979.\"We all saw how he disrespected the courtroom, smirking and laughing amongst his lawyers during witness testimonies. That did not help his case at all,\" said law professor Lim Ji-bong.Lim believes the judge will hand down a life sentence, though, so as to \"avoid making Yoon a martyr\". A death sentence carries political risk as it may further alienate Yoon's supporters and deepen chaos in the country, he said.US-based lawyer and Korea expert Christopher Jumin Lee believes Yoon will ultimately be pardoned no matter what sentence he receives, as Chun and Roh were. \"It's a customary thing about Korean politics,\" Lee said. \"Whatever the sentence, it's a symbolic acknowledgement of how severe the crime is.\"ReutersIt took some 3,000 police officers to finally arrest Yoon in January last yearAiding an enemy stateProsecutors have also alleged that Yoon tried to provoke North Korea into attacking the South so as to justify his martial law declaration. In putting forward this charge, the prosecution relied on evidence found on former military intelligence chief Yeo In-hyung's phone that contained words suggesting potential provocations. They also cited a memo which appeared to push for a move to \"create an unstable situation or seize an arising opportunity\".This trial, which opened on Monday, will look at whether Yoon ordered drone flights into the North to induce military conflict between the Koreas, among other things. Yeo and Yoon's former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun have also been indicted on the same charge.Other chargesYoon has also been accused of perjury, for when he testified during former prime minister Han Duck-soo's trial last year on charges of aiding the insurrection. Prosecutors allege that Yoon falsely testified by claiming he had long planned to hold a cabinet meeting before declaring martial law. Investigators said Yoon had no such plan and only convened a meeting at Han's urging.Apart from charges related to his martial law attempt, Yoon has also been indicted in a series of other cases. He is among 33 people charged for allegedly obstructing an investigation into the death of a young marine officer in 2023, and for aiding the suspect in this case.He has also been charged for meddling in the 2022 presidential elections and making false statements during his campaign.

    "body": "How realistic is India's quest for magnets made of rare earths11 hours agoAnahita SachdevBloomberg via Getty ImagesIndia hopes to make its own rare earth magnets for domestic useIn November 2025, India approved a 73bn-rupee ($800m; £600m) plan that could help it to cut its dependence on China in one of the most strategic corners of the global supply chain: rare earth magnets.These small but powerful components sit at the heart of modern life - used in everything from electric vehicles and wind turbines to smartphones, medical scanners, and defence equipment. Developing a full rare earths ecosystem is expensive, complex and time-consuming. By focusing on magnets instead, one of the most widely used rare-earth products, India aims to achieve self-reliance more quickly. But its success will depend on how fast the country can master technology, secure materials and scale up, experts say. Under the scheme, selected manufacturers will receive capital and sales-linked incentives to produce 6,000 tonnes of permanent magnets a year within seven years. The aim is to meet rising domestic demand, which officials expect to double in five years.Industry experts warn that money alone will not be enough.India today imports 80- 90% of its magnets and related materials from China, which controls more than 90% of global rare earth processing. Official figures show the country imported some $221m worth of magnets and related raw material in 2025.That dependence was exposed last year when China tightened exports during a trade dispute, hitting Indian carmakers and electronics firms, and forcing the electric vehicle (EV) industry to explore alternatives to rare earth magnets altogether.The disruption was temporary, but the lesson lingered - without a sovereign rare earths strategy, entire industries remain vulnerable.India is not alone in scrambling for alternatives. The EU, Australia and others have launched similar efforts to loosen China's grip. For many countries, \"the timing of the controls came as a surprise\", says Rajnish Gupta, a tax and economic policy specialist at EY India.India's challenge, however, is more complex.  Bloomberg via Getty ImagesNeodymium is a type of rare earth element used to make powerful magnetsFor one, it lacks industrial expertise. Countries such as Japan, South Korea and Germany have spent years refining magnet-making technology. India in comparison has virtually no commercial-scale experience, experts say.\"This is a good step in the right direction, but it's only a start,\" says Neha Mukherjee of Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a consulting firm that deals with batteries and rare earth elements. \"India will need strategic partnerships to import technology, skill up its workforce and then build its own capabilities.\"Dr PV Sunder Raju, chief scientist at the National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI), echoed the concern. \"It's not possible to just give 73bn rupees and expect a product without a strong background in research and development,\" he said.There are several research centres, he points out, which can be put to the task. A facility was inaugurated in 2023 at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, and another plant backed by public and private partners aims to produce 5,000 tonnes of magnets a year by 2030. But neither has yet reported output.There is also the question of raw materials. India holds the world's third-largest, rare earth reserves, about 8% of the global total, largely in the sands of coastal states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat. Yet it accounts for less than 1% of global mining. Only one mine is operational in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, and until recently most of its output was exported to Japan under a bilateral deal. (In June 2025, however, India reportedly asked the state miner, IREL, to suspend these exports to safeguard supplies for domestic needs.)Corbis via Getty ImagesMost of India's rare earth reserves are found in sands along its coastTo be fair, India is actively working to expand mining and processing operations. For instance, it has set up the National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM) under which it pledged to maintain stockpiles and keep its supply chain resilient.But even if it does manage to tap into its own rare earth reserves, it has only some  of the elements needed to make magnets.So, it has surpluses of lighter rare earths such as neodymium, but lacks extractable quantities of heavier elements like dysprosium and terbium, which are critical for many high-performance magnets.That raises the question: even if magnets are made in India, will the raw materials still come from China?There are also concerns around the scale of this operation. India already consumes an estimated 7,000 tonnes of magnets a year, Ms Mukherjee says. Producing 6,000 tonnes by the early 2030s may still leave the country short  - and exposed - as demand continues to accelerate.\"If we do not scale capacity, the problem doesn't get solved. We'll still be dependent on China - and China will scale,\" Ms Mukherjee explains. Experts also point out that another challenge will be to price domestically made magnets in a way that they don't get undercut by imports. Chinese magnets are cheap and, unless Indian-made alternatives are competitively priced, imports could continue to dominate.The solution, some argue, may lie in incentives not just for manufacturers but for buyers as well.\"The hope is that Indian players will continue to put in their entrepreneurial energy and get the ecosystem going,\" Mr Gupta says.Despite the challenges, the introduction of the scheme is a recognition of India's ambition to bolster its own rare earth ecosystem, and that's worthwhile, he adds.\"I think this is certainly better than not having taken the step at all.\"",

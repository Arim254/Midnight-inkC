    "body": "2 days agoJeremy BowenInternational Editor, KyivBBCOn a dark and cold night in Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, the netting protecting the road from attacks by explosive drones shimmered and rippled in the headlights of our armoured Toyota Land Cruiser, as we drove down strange and surreal tunnels to get in and out of the most intensive area of fighting in eastern Ukraine. The nets go on for miles, suspended from wooden poles around 20ft high along the sides and over the top of the road. Dystopian military vehicles straight out of Mad Max rumble past, encased in their own cages of steel and netting.Nets snag the propellers of attacking drones, making them a cheap and surprisingly effective physical barrier. Even if their Russian controllers detonate the charge they carry, there is a chance that the explosion will not be close enough to kill people using the road in civilian buses and cars as well as military vehicles.Much of the netting has been donated by European fishermen. Only this week the Scottish government announced it was sending over another 280 tonnes of salmon nets that were about to be recycled. Before any of it gets used, the Ukrainian military crashes drones into it to test its strength.In Ukraine, anti-drone nets go on for miles, suspended from wooden poles The three most feared letters on the battlefield are FPV, standing for \"first-person view.\" FPV drones are major killers, used by both Ukraine and Russia. They have cameras that feed information back to their controllers in a command centre that might be 30 or 40km away. We visited a few of them, hidden away in basements of wrecked buildings or nondescript village houses.Inside there are banks of screens, relaying video and data from drones that is analysed by the Ukrainian military's leading-edge software. The cameras zoom in on small figures of soldiers moving around the ruins, with the controllers directing the men on the ground through walkie-talkies, callsigns and headsets. We could see the men entering buildings where the drones had seen Russians hiding, and emerging after they had killed them. Early versions of the drones were controlled by radio signals, but both sides are experts at electronic warfare and quickly found ways to jam them. Now they are mostly controlled by fibre optic cables, so thin that a spool 25km long (that carries data and video) fits into a container built into the drone that is the size of a large bottle of bleach.The nets snag the propellers of attacking dronesEastern Ukraine used to feel like a throwback to the Western Front in World War One, with trenches and dugouts reinforced against artillery and snipers. After the full-scale invasion four years ago it still, for a while, felt like a 20th Century battlefield. But now drones have transformed the way the war is fought, and armies across the world are watching closely, being forced to change their ideas of how to fight.The narrow confrontation line that used to exist between the two sides is now extended across a broad swathe of land that both sides call the kill zone, stretching perhaps 20km either side of the forward positions of the two armies. Rear positions for logistics and dealing with casualties that used to be relatively safe are now as lethal as the old front line. The skies above get saturated with surveillance drones, making movement extremely dangerous. Social media feeds are full of terrifying videos filmed from FPV drones as they swoop into their targets, sometimes chasing down individuals in the open, or even entering buildings, threading their way through rooms and doorways until they find their quarry. The last shot is often of a horrified man about to die.Artillery and tanks are still formidable weapons. But a drone that costs around a thousand dollars can, in the hands of a skilled pilot, destroy a tank that costs $30m (£22m). The Wall St Journal recently reported that a small group of Ukrainian drone pilots created havoc when they were invited to oppose Nato forces in an exercise in Estonia last year. Nato has a lot of catching up to do. One major consequence of the last four years of war is that Ukraine and Russia are now the most experienced and proficient practitioners of drone warfare in the world.Both countries are constantly innovating to get ahead in the drone war. Both have been using Starlink system owned by the world's richest man, Elon Musk for battlefield communications and navigation. The Russians had a recent setback when Musk agreed to turn off Russian-registered terminals active inside Ukraine. That seems to be a major reason why Ukraine, with an active Starlink system funded by Poland, recently recaptured territory in the south.But all the Ukrainian drone units I visited believed that the Russians would soon find a workaround. They respect the skills of the elite Russian drone units they said were called Rubicon and Day of Judgement. A senior officer told me that western Europeans need to forget the military blunders Russia made after the full-scale invasion four years ago and make a distinction between the thousands of front-line Russian soldiers who are killed every month and the elite drone units that Moscow values as a key part of their war effort. He said they were \"cherished\" by the Russian army.FPV drones have cameras that feed information back to their controllersOn my most recent visit to Ukraine, the threat from drones meant we watched the weather forecast closely before heading into Donetsk, postponing during a day of clear blue skies and waiting for more snow. Drones struggle in bad weather.Feeling a little reassured by the nets and the snow, we headed towards the town of Slovyansk, past the ruined shells of buildings destroyed over the last four years. Slovyansk functions as a town, just about, with some cafes and shops open. But  thousands of residents have moved to safer places, and when the people who have stayed go out, their fear of Russian FPV drones means they hurry down the icy, snow-covered streets to get through their errands to make it home alive. Nets are going up in the town centre.Slovyansk is high on Russian President Vladimir Putin's uncompromising list of terms for a ceasefire. A big part of the price he is demanding is for Ukraine to give up the 20% or so of Donetsk it still controls, along with other land that his army has been unable to capture, in the southern regions of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. According to Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Americans have pushed him to take the deal, to get to a ceasefire by the summer.US President Donald Trump also wants Zelensky to call an election, a demand he has not directed at Putin. The evidence suggests that Trump wants to be able to declare he has ended the war. Even if a ceasefire didn't last, he would treat it as a victory he will take into the US mid-term elections next autumn. He is also eyeing huge business deals with Russia, which cannot happen until sanctions are lifted.The Americans have tried to impose deadlines for a deal. Most recently they told Zelensky he needed to agree to a ceasefire by the summer that Donald Trump could concentrate on the mid-terms. The US inability to bend Ukraine – or Russia – to its will shows that its leverage has limits. Four years after Russia's full scale invasion, there is no discernible evidence that a genuine ceasefire is coming .The dangers in DonetskWhen I saw President Zelensky this weekend in Kyiv, he told me that he could never give up land that Russia has not been able to capture. He would never, he said, abandon the people there, and even if he was tempted to do so it would not work, as within two years by his reckoning, the Russian military would be ready and reequipped and Putin would order them to attack again.The first person we visited in Slovyansk was Oleh Tkachenko, a beefy middle-aged pastor who has built up a remarkable relief operation. He is one of the few people outside the military who travel to the most dangerous areas, delivering bread to outlying villages that he makes in his own bakery, which produces 17,000 loaves per week.After his deliveries he often returns with residents who have had enough of living near the front line. Oleh's bakery is an oasis of order and warmth in the freezing, snow-covered ruins of an industrial area on the edge of Slovyansk.The UN World Food Programme helped him re-establish it when he was forced out of his hometown, which is now occupied. He told me that the dangers in Donetsk have multiplied in the last few months as the drone war has intensified.\"The situation has changed radically. There are only very dangerous places and relatively dangerous places. Nowhere is safe in the Donetsk region anymore.\"I asked him whether Zelensky should give in to Russian and American pressure to sacrifice Donetsk for a ceasefire. It was the same question I put to everyone I met in Slovyansk, and it produced the same kind of answer.\"What more does Putin want? This is my Donetsk region. I was born here. My children were born here. I created my family here. And I should leave all that? What for?\"Putin, he said, should not be allowed to take and keep territory that does not belong to Russia.\"We are destroying the values on which this world is built on one person's whim. Not only will the villain avoid punishment, he [will] also be rewarded? I'm sorry. How many villains like this are there in the world?\"AFP via Getty ImagesZelensky said he could never give up land that Russia has not been able to captureAt a coffee bar I met Oleksii Yukov. He runs an organisation called Advis Platsdarm that collects the bodies of dead soldiers from where they were killed, to honour their memory, and before they get a decent burial, identify them to give their families some certainty about them. Oleksii makes no distinctions between dead Russians and dead Ukrainians, but that does not mean he is also prepared to accept Russian domination in Donetsk. Like Oleh, he does not believe promises made by Putin.\"So if a maniac comes to your home and says, \"Give me your daughter and I won't come back,\" do you really think that a man like this – who rapes and pillages - is simply going to stop?\"\"We all know who the maniacs are, right? It's horrifying. To give away a part of yourself – or your child – to be torn apart… I don't understand why this question is even asked of Ukrainians.\"Oleksii has also recovered the remains of soldiers killed in World War Two in the Donbas, the name used for Donetsk and its neighbouring region, Luhansk, which has fallen to Russia in its entirety. He compares Putin's promises to ones made by Adolf Hitler at the Munich conference in 1938. Hitler claimed that a slice of Czechoslovakia known as the Sudetenland was his last territorial demand in Europe. Britain and France accepted his word as the price of avoiding the World War that started the following year. Like many people in this part of Europe, Oleksii sees parallels with the past.\"Promises made by Russia are worth nothing – just like Hitler's promises that once he took the Sudetenland nothing else would happen. We all saw what that led to: the Second World War. Now it could lead to a Third World War if we do not stop and tell Putin that people live here – people who want to live in their own country, on their own land. Each of them has that right. No Ukrainian has the right to say we can give anything away.\"Oleksii believes that forcing Ukraine to give up Donetsk without a fight would be as much of a betrayal as Czechoslovakia suffered at Munich.Along with its embattled neighbour Kramatorsk, Slovyansk is designated as a \"fortress city\". Both are protected by miles of deep anti-tank ditches filled with razor wire and concrete anti-tank obstacles known as \"dragon's teeth\". The towns sit on a range of hills that is the last high ground before around 150 miles of flat land, mostly fields, that stretch right up to the next natural obstacle, the mighty Dnieper River that bisects Ukraine from north to south. Ukrainians argue that stopping the Russians if they reached the flatlands would be much harder.The BeginningFour years ago, almost to the day, I was at the main railway station in Kyiv, watching a scene straight out of Europe's dark past play out in a bitter wind off the Ukrainian steppe. Kyiv was in the depths of a frigid winter so monochrome that the scene on the platform could have been an old newsreel, but it was 2022 and happening in a technicolour, digital age. It was the loudest warning yet that the world had changed, that old assumptions about European security and the safety of the future had to be forgotten.Since then, other warnings have sounded, in the Middle East, in Sudan and in Taiwan, while the war in Ukraine has incubated the biggest crisis in the North Atlantic alliance since it was created in 1949. The gap remains wide between Trump's openness to Putin and the much harsher view of Moscow held by most European members of Nato.Getty ImagesZelensky said earlier this month that 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the last four yearsIn that first week of the war, the platforms at Kyiv station were packed, mostly with Ukrainian women and children, desperate to board trains going west to escape the advancing Russian army. Russian artillery and answering salvoes from the Ukrainians echoed around the empty streets of the city centre, making the threat to the city frighteningly real. Trains pulled in every 15 or 20 minutes, as many as the endlessly enterprising operators of Ukraine's railway network could find in the sidings and marshalling yards. Frightened people jostled their way on, leaving tearful goodbyes on the platform with those staying to fight. At the height of the evacuation 50,000 people a day were passing through the station.In the station concourse a young soldier with a Kalashnikov slung across his back was hugging his girlfriend before she left to go west and he went back to his unit. They could have been a Norman Rockwell cover for the Saturday Evening Post, the magazine that cheered on Americans after they entered World War Two.Zelensky showed immediately that he was an instinctive war leader, a born communicator who was able to rally his people. On the first dark night of the war, dismissing rumours that he had fled, he appeared in olive green military attire, recording a video selfie in front of the presidency building in Kyiv, with his closest advisors behind him.\"We are all here, our soldiers are here, the citizens of the country are here. We are all here protecting our independence, our country and we are going to continue to do so.\"Getty ImagesUkraine and Russia have been fighting since 2014 when President Putin ordered the occupation and annexation of Crimea on the Black SeaThe first months of Russia's full-scale invasion went by for Ukrainians in waves of fear, determination, grief, and patriotic fervour. Some of the Russian soldiers in towns they had occupied around Kyiv carried out massacres – leaving the bodies sprawled where they had been killed on the highway, on the streets of Bucha and in shallow graves. We saw the bodies after Ukraine forced the Russians to retreat from the capital, a victory that confounded the prediction of their western allies that they would be beaten in a few weeks.Ukraine's unexpected strength persuaded the then US President Joe Biden and other European leaders to send more powerful weapons to Kyiv, though never as many or as fast as the Ukrainians wanted. Ukrainians who stayed were volunteering to fight. Those who couldn't set up workshops that churned out Molotov cocktails and camouflage netting.Four years on that energy has dissipated. That should not be surprising. War is all-consuming, and exhausting.It has been replaced by a grim determination to carry on, especially among front line soldiers and their families. Zelensky said earlier this month that 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the last four years, accepting that many more were classified as missing. The real figure is likely to be much higher than 55,000. The chances are that their remains are somewhere along the 800-mile front line.Recruiting new soldiers to replace them in the terrible danger of the deadly and expanding kill zone on the front lines is a struggle. In the cities and at checkpoints men of military age face snap inspections of their papers. If they are eligible for conscription, and do not have an exemption from service, they can be driven off to the barracks on the spot.Getting enough soldiers to fight on is one of Ukraine's greatest challenges, yet polls show substantial majorities here believe that Ukraine can fight on, despite Russian advances on the battlefield, and has no choice as they believe Russia wants to destroy them as a nation. A majority also do not believe that the US-brokered talks will produce a lasting peace. But even though a majority believe Ukraine does not have a choice about fighting on, putting on a uniform and heading for the front line is not a popular choice.Global Images Ukraine via Getty ImagesIn Kyiv, civilians are being killed in their own homes by Russian drones and ballistic missilesValeriy Puzik, an author and poet, volunteered to fight and has spent months at the front line. I met him in a trendy bar in Kyiv, a world away from the six metre deep dug out he inhabited with his squad at the front line for more than 100 days. I asked him why it was so hard to recruit.\"Because when a person leaves a position, they don't say anything positive. And word of mouth does the worst damage. Because, there is nothing positive there. I wouldn't wish any of my friends to crawl into a burrow and sit there… I was lucky to survive. Usually, people sit in those burrows for 90, 100, 160 days. We were basically supposed to stay there until spring.\"Valeriy survived his latest deployment to the front because he volunteered to evacuate two wounded comrades.Before he could be sent back, his old position was attacked and the men who stayed behind, he says, were killed or are missing. Evacuating the wounded men, he believes, saved his life.\"If it weren't for those injuries, most likely we all would have died there.\"The Long WarUkraine and Russia have been fighting since 2014 when President Putin ordered the occupation and annexation of Crimea on the Black Sea and then seized parts of the Donbas in the east.On this current trip, I have seen no evidence that the war is going to end soon.The full-scale invasion four years ago was Putin's attempt to eliminate the independence of Ukraine once and for all. He has said many times that history shows Ukraine belongs with Russia. A few days before the anniversary of the invasion President Zelensky dismissed that succinctly in a post on X: \"I don't need historical shit to end this war and move to diplomacy. Because it's just a delay tactic. I read no less history books than Putin. And I learned a lot.\"Zelensky has weathered a corruption scandal that forced the resignation last autumn of his chief of staff, Andrii Yermak. He has trenchant critics, and potential rivals, but still has approval ratings of which most western leaders can only dream.Gwara Media/Global Images Ukraine via Getty ImagesThe Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022This week, far to the east of Kyiv, the trains that evacuated hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians in February and March 2022 are still taking people out of harm's way. The Russia military moves at a glacial pace, but in the key battleground of Donetsk in the east it is grinding forward, chewing up lives, the landscape, and whole villages and towns. Ukraine still holds around a fifth of Donetsk oblast, or region. It is the most intensely fought-over part of Ukraine.One after another, a series of battles over four years have turned towns and villages into rubble, from Bakhmut earlier in the war to Pokrovsk now.Every day buses cross the regional border from Donetsk to Lozova in the Kharkiv oblast, carrying civilian evacuees. A school has been turned into a warm and clean relief coordination centre – packed with families surrounded with a few bags of possessions, dogs on leads, cats in baskets and most of all tormented by loss. Serhii and Viktoria had arrived from Druzhkivka, a town that has been sucked into the kill zone. Their teenage daughter Diana sat silently next to them, with her cat Mika on her lap. Like millions of others displaced by war, here and in other turbulent stretches of the world, they were leaving to save themselves, knowing too well that also meant not just losing the remains of their old lives, but also personal independence. Now they had to sit and wait while the paperwork was done and someone else told them what to do. Viktoria explained why they had left their home.\"We are on the brink. We didn't have any gas, water or power. No heating. We were staying there till the very last moment, freezing for three days.\"Back at the end of 2022, their town, Druzhkivka, was seen as a relatively safe haven when we used it as a base to report the Russian attack on Bakhmut. But no one goes there now, Viktoria says. Druzhkivka is too dangerous.\"The drones destroy everything alive – the cars, the people, their homes. I can't tell you without tears.\"Serhii looked prematurely old.\"It is very difficult. We have abandoned everything we worked for our whole lives. Everything we worked for, for our families, all we were building. And we had to abandon all that in one moment…everything… We could only pack some small things. We could not have taken more.\"Standing near them was Tamara, with her nine-year-old twin granddaughters, Mila and Tina.\"The kids. We left because of the kids. We live near the forest… There are lots of tanks… drones are flying everywhere… there is no peace …the children are running to me and crying… it is very loud…. Everything is shaking…\"Lviv in western Ukraine, where families were send to from Lozova Once they were registered, the families with their bags and their pets were bused to Lozova station, to board a long train heading for Lviv in western Ukraine. Lozova used to be a busy junction for trains heading further east. Now it is now the last stop for Ukrainian railways. The lines beyond it are too dangerous.A defiant UkraineThe talks brokered by Trump's envoys, the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner and his friend, the real estate billionaire, Steve Witkoff, continue. They are expected to convene again in Geneva after the anniversary of the invasion. Witkoff made positive noises after the last round but both Russia and Ukraine talked about a difficult atmosphere.It is hard to see any kind of ceasefire emerging unless either Putin or Zelensky change their fundamental positions. Since both sides believe they can fight on to some kind of victory that is not likely to change.The negotiations appear more of an exercise in placating Trump, so that he cannot blame either Moscow or Kyiv for their failure. The US president tends to default back to putting pressure on Ukraine. In the past he has claimed, untruthfully, that Zelensky is a dictator who started the war. Zelensky laughed and said it wasn't true when I asked him about it. On the eve of the last round, just before the anniversary Trump told journalists that \"Ukraine better come to the table, fast\".AFP via Getty ImagesPresident Zelensky said if Ukraine is to fight on, it will need increasing levels of European supportTrump has ended almost all military aid, but Ukraine still depends on intelligence only the US can provide. Europe buys US weapons, especially interceptor missiles from the Americans on behalf of Ukraine.On this trip to Ukraine I have found a country that remains defiant. It does not feel close to defeat.The big cities function well, despite Russia's concerted and effective attacks throughout this bitterly cold winter on its power and heating grid. In Kyiv, there are traffic jams, well-stocked shops, restaurants and cafés. There are also air-raid sirens, often in the small hours of the morning, and terrible stories of civilians being killed in their own homes by Russian drones and ballistic missiles. Ukraine is rebuilding the military-industrial complex that existed here in Soviet times, concentrating on long range strikes on Russia.Russia has made concerted and effective attacks on Ukraine's power and heating gridPresident Zelensky told me they can win the war, and if Ukraine is to fight on, it will need increasing levels of European support.Spring is in sight, but in this part of Europe winter can drag on into April. Russia has put immense pressure on Ukraine throughout the coldest winter in years by targeting power stations and Soviet-era plants that provide districts with hot water and heat.In the ruins of a power station that the Ukrainians allowed us to visit on condition we did not identify it, workers were salvaging steel from the wreckage. The plant had been hammered by Russian missiles and drones. Repairs were out of the question. It needed to be rebuilt. With his breath condensing in clouds in temperatures double figures below zero, a foreman summed the attitude that is common here, when I asked him why Russia was attacking them.\"They want to make us kneel. They want to bring Ukraine to its knees.\"That is a fact, and Ukraine's determination to stop it happening is why this war continues.More from InDepthTop picture credit: Global Images Ukraine via Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "8 hours agoPaulin KolaEPAMost of the victims were young and relatives are still struggling to comprehendThe Swiss government has announced an emergency payout of 50,000 francs ($65,000;  £48,000) for the victims of the deadly fire at the ski bar resort of Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve.The so-called solidarity contribution will go to each of the 115 injured and the families of the 41 who died, the Federal Council said. Initial findings from the investigation suggest the fire at Le Constellation bar began as sparklers attached to champagne bottles ignited soundproof foam that lined the ceiling of the bar's basement, which was packed with people.Most of the victims of the fire were young - eight were under the age of 16 - and 58 people are still being treated in hospital for severe burns.The announcement of the payout was made by Swiss President Guy Parmelin and Finance Minister Beat Jans.They said the one-off sum would be in addition to the emergency aid of 10,000 francs offered by the regional government of the canton of Valais where Carns-Montana is situated and \"intended to offer rapid, un-bureaucratic assistance to those affected\". The federal government is also pledging to provide funding of up to 20m francs in addition to facilitating talks between the victims, officials and insurers to reach amicable compensation agreements, Jans said. \"The Federal Council shares with the victims and their families the desire for truth and justice,\" Parmelin told a press conference. \"We, too, want to know what happened, why, and how it could have been prevented.\"Local authorities have acknowledged that the bar had not undergone safety checks for five years.The owners of the bar, Jacques and Jessica Moretti, have been accused of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.Criminal proceedings have also been brought against the municipality's head of public safety and a former council fire safety inspector.",

    "body": "Two charged with murder of Australian grandfather after 'mistaken identity' kidnapping11 hours agoRobert GreenallNSW PolicePolice say Chris Baghsarian, 85, was kidnapped by mistake Two men in their 20s have been charged with the kidnap and murder of a Sydney grandfather.Police say widower Chris Baghsarian, 85, was taken from his home in the northern suburb of North Ryde on 13 February, in what they believe was a case of mistaken identity. He was found dead on Monday.Local media say the alleged attack may have been aimed at a family with links to organised crime.The two men were refused bail and will appear in court on Thursday.Investigators say more arrests are likely as they believe others are involved in the alleged kidnapping and murder.The two men, aged 24 and 29, were arrested earlier on Wednesday, as forensic testing confirmed that a body located near a golf course on the city outskirts belonged to Baghsarian.They were charged with murder and detaining a person with intent to ransom and occasion actual bodily harm.Both were previously known to authorities for minor matters.Police said: \"Early inquiries established that Chris Baghsarian was not the intended target of the kidnapping and had been taken in a case of mistaken identity.\"Baghsarian's family have welcomed news of the arrests, and requested the media respect their privacy. New South Wales Robbery and Serious Crime Squad Commander Andrew Marks described the attack as \"somebody's worst nightmare\".\"The fact that an innocent man was taken from his home is not acceptable,\" he said, quoted by AFP.\"These people need to be held to account for that.\"In the days after the kidnapping, police made several pleas for those who had taken Baghsarian to safely return him as he had health issues and needed daily medication.Police have said the discovery of two burnt-out cars and a raid on an abandoned property in Dural, an outer suburb of Sydney, led them to an area in nearby Pitt Town where they found the remains.Authorities have urged any witnesses who saw anything near the golf course on 14 February - the day after the kidnapping - to contact police.",

    "body": "17 hours agoLana Lam and Tessa WongGetty ImagesAnthony Albanese was evacuated from his official residence for several hoursA bomb scare at the Australian prime minister's home originated from written threats directed at a Chinese dance and music group banned by Beijing.In emails seen by local media and the BBC, performers of the Shen Yun group were told to cancel their upcoming Australian shows or risk explosives being detonated at Anthony Albanese's official residence in the nation's capital.Authorities refused to comment on the emails, only confirming they had attended an \"alleged security incident\" at the leader's home on Tuesday and \"nothing suspicious was located\".Shen Yun was founded by the religious movement Falun Gong, which is banned in China.Albanese was evacuated from his home at 18:00 local time (07:00 GMT) and taken to another location for several hours, police said.One of the emails, which was written in Chinese, said large quantities of nitro-glycerine explosives have been placed around the Lodge, the name of the prime minister's official residence in Canberra.\"If you insist on proceeding with the performance, then the Prime Minister's Lodge will be blown into ruins and blood will flow like a river.\"The threat was reported to police by Shen Yun on Tuesday, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. A statement from Shen Yun sent to the BBC said they would proceed with their performances in Australia and called on the Australian government to conduct a comprehensive investigation.Asked about the email threats, a spokesperson for the Australian Federal Police declined to comment.In a social media post on Wednesday morning, Albanese thanked police and people who had sent in \"kind messages\", accompanied by a photo of his cavoodle guarding the door.\"Toto on alert but all good,\" he said.Interrupted by protesters at an event on Wednesday, Albanese also repeated previous calls to lower the temperature of political debate in the country.\"I think it's just a reminder to take every opportunity to tell people turn the heat down, for goodness sake, we can't take these things for granted.\"Religious group banned in ChinaThe incident follows a similar bomb threat made last week in the US, which forced an evacuation of the Kennedy Center of Performing Arts in Washington DC. US media reports said the threat was directed at Shen Yun who perform at the centre.Wednesday's statement from Shen Yun claims the dance troupe has faced scores of threats to its performances held across the world in the last two years. Falun Gong has been banned in China since 1999 when the Chinese government branded the group an illegal cult and launched a crackdown. Based in upstate New York, the group started Shen Yun in 2006, which puts on elaborate dance performances containing thinly veiled attacks on the Chinese Communist Party.  In recent years the dance troupe has faced allegations that it mistreats its employees, which it has denied.Falun Gong has claimed for years that it is the target of attacks and repression from the Chinese government. Asked about the incident on Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said she was \"not aware of the actual situation\", and added that \"China consistently opposes all forms of violent attacks\".An unnamed Australian government source told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that people should not \"jump to any conclusions\" about the bomb threat, and that it could have come from a member of the community hostile to Falun Gong.",

    "body": "6 hours agoFiona Nimoni,in LondonandIone Wells,in São Paulo, BrazilAPMarielle Franco was 38 years old when she was shot dead Brazil's Supreme Court has voted to convict two politicians of ordering the murder of the prominent Rio de Janeiro councillor and activist, Marielle Franco. Brothers Domingos Inácio Brazão and João Francisco Inácio Brazão were sentenced to more than 76 years each for masterminding the drive-by shooting that killed Franco alongside her driver Anderson Gomes in 2018. Franco, a gay black woman, was an emerging figure in Brazil's socialist party, with her death at the age of 38 sparking nationwide protests.Four justices concluded unanimously that the Brazão brothers targeted Franco because she was considered a threat to their interests.Franco had worked with Rio de Janeiro's city council to oppose housing developments in poorer neighbourhoods that were a source of income for militia groups.The case exposed links between politicians and organised crime.The brothers \"didn't just have contact with the militia. They were the militia,\" Judge Alexandre de Moraes said.The only woman on the Supreme Court, Carmen Lucia, said the process had caused her \"great spiritual and psychological harm\", asking how many more \"Marielles will Brazil allow to be murdered?\"In a post on Instagram, Franco's sister Anielle Franco - who serves as minister for racial equality - paid tribute to Brazil's judicial system, saying it had \"honoured the memory of Marielle and Anderson\". She added: \"It has been eight years of struggle to find out who ordered Marielle's murder and why. Eight years of fighting for full justice. \"Brazil begins a new historic chapter in confronting political violence based on gender and race. Impunity cannot be part of our democracy.\"In 2024, two former police officers were jailed in 2024 over Marielle's murder. Ronnie Lessa confessed to firing the shots and was sentenced to 78 years and nine months, while Élcio de Queiroz received 59 years and eight months for being behind the wheel.The Brazao brothers were arrested in 2024 after Lessa named them as the masterminds behind the murders as part of a plea deal with prosecutors.Getty ImagesAnielle Franco, pictured with her father and mother, was in the Supreme Court on Wednesday to hear the verdict ",

    "body": "Spain declassifies files on 1981 attempted coup in effort to dispel conspiracy theories6 hours agoGuy Hedgecoe,BBC Madrid correspondentandRobert Greenall,BBC NewsGetty ImagesCoup leader Antonio Tejero Molina died on the very same day as the files were declassified.Spain's government has released dozens of documents related to an attempted coup that took place 45 years ago - regarded as a key moment in the country's history.A group of armed officers burst into parliament and threatened MPs, aiming to overthrow the country's fledgling democracy and return it to dictatorship. Their efforts failed when King Juan Carlos refused to support them. However, conspiracy theories have abounded since, including that the king may have had prior knowledge of the coup or even that he may have been actively involved. The release of the files also came on the same day as the death of the coup's leader, Antonio Tejero Molina, at the age of 93. Tejero's lawyer described him as a \"man of honour, unwavering faith, and great love for Spain\".\"May God grant him the peace that men denied him,\" he wrote on X on behalf of his family.On 23 February 1981, a group of officers led by Tejero burst into the main chamber of the national parliament, wielding guns and threatening the politicians as a new government was being sworn in. Their aim was to return authoritarianism - six years after the death of the country's dictator Francisco Franco.A photo of Tejero brandishing a handgun in the parliament as MPs take cover is perhaps the most famous image of the coup.Getty ImagesKing Juan Carlos ascended the throne two days after the death of Gen Francisco FrancoThe release of the 153 classified files generated enormous expectation - so much so that the government web page where the documents were to be posted collapsed temporarily. They include police and judicial reports, transcriptions of conversations between officials, and the reactions of foreign governments to the events.But the files themselves appear to contain no explosive revelations. Franco - Spain's brutal dictator - died in 1975, paving the way for the introduction of a parliamentary monarchy.Six years later, Spain's fragile democracy appeared to hang in the balance for several hours as the coup attempt took place. Eventually, it failed, after the young king addressed Spaniards - and the armed forces - via a televised message, expressing his opposition to the rebels and ordering all military to remain in their barracks.For many Spaniards, the episode sealed Juan Carlos's status as the saviour of their young democracy and the country's rejection of Francoist values.However, in the decades since, many have cast doubt over the supposedly heroic role of the king. Other theories claimed the uprising was a set-up by the political establishment aimed at providing a test that would reinforce the country's democracy.The current, Socialist-led government of Pedro Sánchez said having documents related to this event under lock and key was an \"historical anomaly\" that needed to be corrected and that their release posed no risk to anyone. It also said their declassification would serve to undermine those peddling false theories about the coup.However, there were some interesting revelations in the files, including that six members of the intelligence services were involved in the plot. Another document showed the security forces estimated that, if a police special unit attempted to break into the parliament building, it might lead to \"between 80 and 110 deaths\".Among the documents were also messages of support from foreign governments once the coup had failed. A message in Spanish from Queen Elizabeth II to King Juan Carlos read: \"All of us in Great Britain are reassured to know the final result.\"",

    "body": "19 hours agoKelly NgandShaimaa Khalil,Tokyo correspondentGetty ImagesYonaguni is visible from Taiwan's shores on a clear dayJapan plans to deploy surface-to-air missiles to its remote western island near Taiwan by March 2031, its defence minister said, as regional tensions simmer.It is the first time that Japan specified a timeline for the missile deployment to Yonaguni island since it was announced in 2022.China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own and has not ruled out the use of force to \"reunify\" with it. Yonaguni is visible from Taiwan's shores on a clear day, located just 110km (68 miles) away.Tensions between Tokyo and Beijing have run high since November when Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi appeared to suggest that Japan would activate its self-defence force in the event of an attack on Taiwan.The worry has long been that any attack on Taiwan, which counts the US as an ally, could result in a direct military conflict between Washington and Beijing, then widen to include other US allies in the region such as Japan.Takaichi's remarks to parliament plunged ties with China to their lowest level in years and Beijing has been piling on the pressure in a wide range of ways - sending warships, throttling rare earth exports, curbing Chinese tourism, cancelling concerts and even reclaiming its pandas.Japanese defence minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced the timeline for the missiles on Tuesday, a day after China imposed export curbs on 20 Japanese companies and entities, citing national security concerns.Koizumi said the Yonaguni unit will be equipped with medium-range surface-to-air missiles able to intercept incoming aircraft and missiles.With a range of about 50km and 360-degree capability, the Japanese-made missile system can track up to 100 targets simultaneously and engage up to 12 at once.China has yet to react to Koizumi's announcement. But when Koizumi visited Yonaguni in November, Beijing said Japan was moving to \"create regional tension and provoke military confrontation\".Within days, China flew drones near the island to express its anger, prompting Japan to scramble aircraft jets in response.The latest developments come after Takaichi secured a landslide victory in parliamentary elections earlier this month. That victory gave Takaichi political space to double down on boosting Japan's defence capabilities.This makes the announcement on Yonaguni island more than just a military adjustment - it looks like the opening chapter for a more assertive Tokyo. And as Takaichi bolsters the country's military and defence budget, such assertiveness seems unlikely to end here.The Yonaguni announcement also shows where Japan sees its front line - and how far it is prepared to go to defend it.Over the past decade, Japan has transformed sleepy Yonaguni into a military outpost, which currently handles coastal surveillance and is staffed by some 160 members of Japan's self-defence force. An electronic warfare unit capable of disrupting enemy communications and radar will be set up there in fiscal year 2026, which runs from April to March next year. The timing for the deployment of the missile unit \"may change depending on the progress of future facility improvements, but the current plan is for fiscal year 2030\", Koizumi said.",

    "body": "22 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterScreenshot from Guangdong NewsShein boss Xu Yangtian, otherwise known as Sky Xu The founder of Chinese fast-fashion giant Shein made a rare public appearance on Tuesday, as he re-affirmed his ties to Beijing and investments in the country's clothing industry.Speaking at a business conference in Guangdong, home to many of China's garment factories, Xu Yangtian highlighted that Shein is investing 10bn yuan (£1.08bn; $1.45bn) in the province to create a high-tech fashion hub.Xu praised the Chinese government and said \"nourishment\" from Guangdong has been \"inseparable\" from Shein's success.His speech follows years of Shein focusing away from China, with the firm moving its headquarters to Singapore and pursuing a potential stock market listing in New York and London.The Shein boss, also known as Sky or Chris Xu, was speaking at the High-quality Development Conference in Guangzhou, a global manufacturing powerhouse that is home to most of China's clothing production.The city's factories are the backbone of Shein's fast-fashion operation, allowing it to turn the latest trends into low‑cost clothes to be sold online within a matter of weeks.Xu credited the \"world-class business environment\" that local officials have built and the region's \"complete industrial ecosystem\" as a reason that companies like his have thrived.For Shein, local support has helped the firm grow to support more than 600,000 jobs in the area, Xu said. He described Guangdong as \"fertile ground\" for development, pledging to bring more digital services to the region and make its factories even more efficient.Shein first announced plans for the 10bn yuan investment in 2023, which it is using to improve the province's supply chains.Getty ImagesGuangdong province is home to a textile production hubShein will \"remain firmly rooted in Guangdong and build a world-class fashion industry cluster,\" Xu said.His live-streamed remarks, made to provincial officials and other company chiefs, has been widely circulated on Chinese social media and covered by local news.The speech marked an unusual public appearance for the Shein founder, who has largely stayed out of the public eye even as the firm expanded globally to reach customers in more than 160 countries.Shein has faced a number of challenges in recent years as tensions between Beijing and the West has led to increased scrutiny of Chinese firms.Concerns have also been raised about the environmental impact of the fast-fashion industry and labour conditions in its supply chain.The company has said it has removed the listings, banned the sellers and that it is working to tighten its platform's rules.The sale of the dolls drew backlash in Europe, especially in Paris, where shoppers protested the opening of Shein's first concession in France.",

    "body": "20 hours agoPaul NjieAFP via Getty ImagesHomosexual acts are already banned in the mainly Muslim West African countrySenegal's Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko has introduced legislation that could double the maximum penalty for same-sex relations, making them punishable by up to 10 years in prison.The proposal was sent to parliament on Tuesday after cabinet approval last week, after a wave of arrests over alleged same-sex relationships, already banned under Senegal law.Addressing lawmakers, Sonko said the bill would punish what it describes as \"acts against nature\" with prison sentences ranging from five to 10 years, compared with the current one- to five-year terms.\"If an act is committed with a minor, it will attract the maximum penalty,\" he said. The bill has been criticised by rights advocates. Debate over LGBT rights has long generated tension in Senegal, a conservative country where some groups portray pro-LGBT activism as foreign interference. Religious organisations have held demonstrations in recent years calling for harsher punishments.Earlier this month, police detained 12 men, among them two public figures and a prominent journalist, under anti-LGBT laws. Local media outlets say around 30 people have been arrested in total this month.Sonko explained that the draft law defines any sexual conduct between two people of the same sex as an \"act against nature\". The bill proposes prison terms of three to seven years for anyone found to be promoting or advocating same-sex relations.It also prescribes separate punishment for those who accuse others of homosexuality \"without proof\".Those found guilty of crimes in the bill could also face fines up to 10 million CFA francs (about $18,000; £13,000), Sonko added. Sonko said the revised law would keep the offence at its current misdemeanour level.\"We can achieve the intended objectives without going so far as to elevate the acts to the level of more serious crimes,\" he added. A date has yet to be set for parliament to vote on the bill, in a chamber controlled by Sonko's Pastef party.Sonko, a former firebrand opposition leader appointed prime minister in 2024, had pledged to criminalise same-sex relations in the Muslim-majority country.Human Rights Watch said the recent anti-LGBT crackdown violated \"multiple internationally protected rights,\" including equality and nondiscrimination.Several African countries have also introduced similar sanctions against the LGBT community in recent years. In September last year, Burkina Faso's transitional parliament approved a bill banning homosexual acts, following its neighbour Mali in 2024.In 2023, Uganda voted in some of the world's harshest anti-homosexual legislation meaning that anybody engaging in certain same-sex acts can be sentenced to death.Additional reporting by Wycliffe Muia You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

The pontiff belongs to the Augustinian religious order and had previously called for interfaith dialogue in the North African country.While it will be the Pope's first pastoral visit to Africa since assuming the leadership of the Catholic Church, he is no stranger to the continent. As Cardinal Robert Prevost, he visited several countries including Kenya and Tanzania. His decision to travel to the continent highlights Africa's growing importance to the church - it is home to about 20% of the world's Catholics.In January, Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo, Archbishop of Kinshasa and President of the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar hinted at the Pope's plans to visit Africa in April.\"When the Pope visits a country, especially countries in crisis like ours, it is also to give hope to the people, especially people who are suffering,\" the cardinal said in an interview with Vatican News after meeting the pontiff.The Pope's visit to Africa follows his first foreign trip to Turkey and Lebanon late last year, where he called for peace and reconciliation in the Middle East.The last papal trip to Africa took place in February 2023, when Leo's predecessor, Pope Francis, visited the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan.The official programme of the Pope's activities during his tour is yet to be released.However, Vatican News reports that the tour from April 13 to 23, will include stops in Algiers and Annaba in Algeria; Yaoundé, Bamenda and Douala in Cameroon; Luanda, Muxima and Saurimo in Angola; and Malabo, Mongomo and Bata in Equatorial Guinea, the continent's only Spanish‑speaking nation.Additional reporting by Jean OtalorMore about Pope Leo XIV from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Don't break up NewJeans and I'll forgo $18m payout, says ex-K-pop boss17 hours agoKelly NgandHosu Lee,SeoulGetty ImagesMin said she \"can no longer bear to watch\" NewJeans get \"torn apart\" when its five members \"should instead be standing happily on stage\"The ex-boss of NewJeans' record label has offered to forgo a 25.6bn won ($17.9m; £13.2m) payout if entertainment giant Hybe drops all lawsuits against the K-pop group.Min Hee-jin said she \"can no longer bear to watch\" NewJeans get \"torn apart\" when its five members \"should instead be standing happily on stage\". The chart-topping band has been locked in a bitter feud with its label Ador, a Hybe subsidiary, since it sacked Min as the label's CEO in August 2024.NewJeans, who saw Min as a mentor, announced they would leave the agency following her dismissal, but a South Korea district court ruled last October that they must honour their contract with Ador, which runs until 2029.In a separate ruling earlier this month, the court sided with Min in a put option dispute with Hybe, ordering the entertainment giant to pay her 25.6bn won.A put option is a contract that gives its owner the right to sell an asset at a future date at a predetermined price.Hybe has appealed against the ruling.\"I'm here because there are values I desperately want more than a large sum of money,\" Min said on Wednesday, noting that NewJeans was the main reason behind her decision to give up the payout.Min has called for the withdrawal of all ongoing civil and criminal lawsuits against NewJeans members, as well as external partners, former Ador employees, and fans who have been drawn into the conflict.\"Only then will the artistes, their families, and their fans be free from further unnecessary noise,\" she said.Hybe has yet to respond to her offer.NewJeans, who became the eighth biggest-selling act in the world a year after their debut in 2022, were seen as a game-changer by critics for their blend of 1990s R&B and sugar-coated pop melodies. Their dramatic row with Hybe has rocked the K-pop world. Fans around the world have taken to social media urging the agency to \"free NewJeans\".\"It's not fair at all. Free NewJeans [all 5 members],\" a fan wrote on Instagram after Marsh's termination last year. \"All they wanted to do was to be [artists] and make their fans happy.\"Min's statement on Wednesday echoed these sentiments. She concluded it by addressing Hybe's chairman Bang Si-hyuk: \"Let us now meet not in the courtroom, but in the space of creation\".",

    "body": "12 hours agoBen HattonBBC NewsReutersBill Gates \"took responsibility for his actions\" and addressed his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during a meeting with staff from his charitable foundation, the organisation said.\"Bill spoke candidly, addressing several questions in detail,\" the Gates Foundation said in a statement.The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that Gates apologised to staff, said he had two affairs with Russian women which Epstein later found out about, and in relation to the late financier said: \"I did nothing illicit. I saw nothing illicit.\"Gates has come under renewed scrutiny over his relationship with Epstein following the release of files by the US Department of Justice in January. The Microsoft co-founder, 70, has not been accused of wrongdoing by any of Epstein's victims.The WSJ reported that Gates said it was a \"huge mistake to spend time with Epstein\", but insisted he \"never spent any time with victims, the women around him\".\"I apologise to other people who are drawn into this because of the mistake that I made,\" he told staff, according to the US newspaper, which said it had reviewed a recording of Gates's remarks. It reported that Gates said images of him with women, whose faces are redacted, included in the so-called Epstein files were pictures that the late financier asked him to take with his assistants after their meetings.US House Oversight CommitteeAn image released by the US House Oversight Committee from the Epstein files in December last yearGates told the foundation's staff he met Epstein in 2011 - years after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution - adding that he said he was aware of some \"18-month thing\" that had limited Epstein's travel, but that he didn't properly check his background, according to the report.He continued to meet Epstein through 2014, and spent time with him abroad, he reportedly said, adding that he \"never stayed overnight\" or visited Epstein's island.The relationship continued even after his ex-wife expressed doubts, he is reported to have said, adding: \"To give her credit, she was always kind of sceptical about the Epstein thing.\"Epstein told him he had links with other billionaires and suggested he could help raise money for charitable causes Gates was engaged with, the paper reported.A spokesperson for the Gates Foundation said in a statement: \"This was a scheduled town hall with employees, which Bill does twice a year. \"In the conversation, Bill answered questions submitted by foundation staff on a range of issues, including the release of the Epstein files, the foundation's work in AI, and the future of global health.  \"In the town hall, Bill spoke candidly, addressing several questions in detail, and took responsibility for his actions.\"Gates established his philanthropic organisation alongside his then wife, Melinda French Gates. They divorced in 2021 after 27 years of marriage.In an interview with an NPR podcast earlier this month she said the latest release of files dredged up \"painful times in my marriage\".Watch: Melinda Gates reacts to ex-husband in Epstein files\"I am so happy to be away from all the muck,\" she said, adding elsewhere in the interview: \"Whatever questions remain there of what - I can't even begin to know all of it - those questions are for those people and for even my ex-husband. \"They need to answer to those things, not me.\"US media have reported that before their separation Melinda had been upset about her husband's association with Epstein. After their split was announced, Bill Gates acknowledged having had an affair with a Microsoft employee in 2019.In his reported remarks to staff on Tuesday, Gates said he met the two women with whom he said he had affairs with through his own social and business activities. New York State Division of Criminal Justice ServicesEpstein was found dead in his prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking chargesIt follows claims made in emails drafted by Epstein in July 2013, and contained in the files released in January, that Gates contracted a sexually transmitted infection and tried to hide it, including from his then-wife Melinda.Gates's spokesperson has previously called the claim \"absolutely absurd and completely false\".One draft email is written as a resignation letter from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and complains about having had to procure medicine for Gates \"in order to deal with the consequences of sex with Russian girls\".\"While Mr Gates acknowledges that meeting with Epstein was a serious error in judgment, he unequivocally denies any improper conduct related to Epstein and the horrible activities in which Epstein was involved,\" they said at the time.Gates said in an interview with Australian outlet 9News in February that his interactions with Epstein were limited to dinners and that he regretted \"every minute\" he spent with him. \"I apologise that I did that,\" he said.In separate statement shared previously in response to the latest batch of Epstein files, the Gates Foundation said \"a small number of foundation employees interacted\" with the late financier on the basis that he claimed to be able to \"mobilise significant philanthropic resources\".\"Ultimately, the foundation did not pursue any collaboration with Epstein and no fund was ever created. At no time were financial payments made by the foundation to Epstein, nor was he employed by the foundation at any time,\" it said.",

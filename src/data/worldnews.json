    "body": "Raccoons may be inching closer to becoming America's next pet.Affectionately referred to as trash pandas, the masked mammals known for rummaging rubbish bins for easy food, are evolving based on their proximity to humans, even starting to look cuter, a new study says. Evaluation of nearly 20,000 photos found \"a clear reduction in snout length\" in urban raccoons compared to their rural cousins - a physical shift consistent with the early stages of domestication seen in cats and dogs.Some that have been adopted as pets have become TikTok celebrities. One particularly bold dumpster-diver even sprinted across the pitch during a Major League Soccer match in Philadelphia last year.The stripe-tailed mammals, also nicknamed \"backyard bandits\", are widespread across the contiguous US. Their ability to thrive in both wild and urban settings has left them occupying an unusual space in American life - beloved pet in some neighbourhoods, persistent pest in others.The proximity to humans could signal that the creatures are growing more comfortable around us, or, scientifically speaking, dampening their innate flight responses, according to the study published in the journal Frontiers in Zoology.The softening of their features could be due to shifts in their fight-or-flight response on the cellular level, it says.This urban domestication starts with trash, the study's co-author, Raffaela Lesch of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, told Scientific American.\"Trash is really the kickstarter,\" she said. \"Wherever humans go, there's trash — and animals love our trash.\"But to take advantage of this endless buffet, wildlife must strike a delicate balance: bold enough to root through bins and navigate human environments, yet not so bold as to pose a threat. \"If you have an animal that lives close to humans, you have to be well-behaved enough,\" Lesch said. \"That selection pressure is quite intense.\"The finding, the authors said, is consistent with the \"domestication syndrome phenotype\". Domestication syndrome - anatomical and morphological changes such as curly tails, floppy ears, depigmentation, smaller brains and reduced facial skeletons - are commonly cited as some of the most salient traits, the study says. Those traits are also seen among more common household pets, such as dogs that evolved from wolves.The study's authors also hypothesised that the domestication process is wrongly believed to be initiated by humans, who have captured or selectively bred animals in the past. The process might actually begin much earlier than previously thought, they said, notably when animals became habituated to human environments.\"Only animals with dampened flight (or fight) responses would succeed best,\" the authors wrote. \"This makes the initial stages of the domestication process a process of pure natural selection.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoAna FaguyGetty ImagesPresident Donald Trump accused six Democratic lawmakers of \"seditious behaviour, punishable by death\", after they released a video urging US service members to refuse unlawful commands.\"This is really bad, and Dangerous to our Country. Their words cannot be allowed to stand. SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!! LOCK THEM UP???,\" Trump wrote on social media.The six lawmakers, all of whom have served in the military or intelligence community, called Trump's remarks dangerous and said they amounted to threats against elected officials.\"No threat, intimidation, or call for violence will deter us from that sacred obligation,\" they said in a joint statement.The video by Democrats, which was shared by Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin, features Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Representatives Chris DeLuzio of Pennsylvania, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania and Jason Crow of Colorado.Sen Kelly, who served in the Navy and is a former astronaut, says: \"Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders.\"\"No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our constitution,\" the lawmakers say in the video.\"This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens,\" it says. \"Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this Constitution. Right now, the threats coming to our Constitution aren't just coming from abroad but from right here at home.\"The response from Trump on Thursday morning came in a series of posts on Truth Social. \"It's called SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL. Their words cannot be allowed to stand — We won't have a Country anymore!!! An example MUST BE SET,\" he wrote in one post on Thursday.He went on to say: \"This is really bad, and Dangerous to our Country. Their words cannot be allowed to stand. SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!! LOCK THEM UP???\"In a third post, he wrote: \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\"Trump also reposted a TruthSocial post that read \"HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!\"At a press briefing on Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected suggestions that Trump was calling for the execution of members of Congress.\"Many in this room want to talk about the president's response, but not what brought the president to responding in this way,\" she said, accusing the lawmakers of encouraging military personnel to defy \"lawful orders\".Heightened concern over US political rhetoricLeavitt quickly responded \"no\" when asked at a White House press briefing on Thursday afternoon whether Trump wants to \"execute\" members of Congress, saying the media should instead focus on the lawmakers' own comments.\"They are literally saying to 1.3 million active duty service members to defy the chain of command, not to follow lawful orders,\" Leavitt said at Thursday's press briefing. \"It perhaps is punishable by law,\" she added later.Leadership in the US House of Representatives have said they are working with Capitol Police to adequately protect the lawmakers - and their families - who are at the centre of Trumps' posts. Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries slammed Trump's remarks, saying the president must \"recant his violent rhetoric before he gets someone killed\".Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, however, defended the president, saying Trump was simply \"defining the crime of sedition\" calling the Democrats' video \"wildly inappropriate\" and \"very dangerous\".The Department of Justice and Pentagon will be reviewing the matter, he said.Trump's remarks come amid heightened concern about politically motivated attacks in the US.An October Pew Research Center study found 85% of Americans believe such violence is increasing, a trend echoed in a November Politico and Public First poll.Trump, himself, was targeted in two alleged assassination attempts - one at a political rally during his presidential campaign last year that left one person dead. Trump and several others in attendance were injured.Just this year there have been a number of high-profile incidents, including the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, an arson attack on Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's home, and the killing of a Democratic Minnesota lawmaker and her husband. In the wake of Kirk's murder, many conservatives including Trump spoke out against Democrats and said they were responsible for the growing political violence in the US. Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene recently spoke out about the increased number of threats she's received since breaking with Trump on some policies. Their feud boiled over last week when Trump posted several times about her, calling her \"wacky\" and a \"traitor\". Her son also received a death threat, according to local police. More public officials are reporting swatting - making prank calls to emergency services to deploy a Special Weapons and Tactics team (Swat) - attempts in recent months. That includes an Indiana Republican who was the focus of a separate Truth Social attack from the president, over his stance on redistricting in the state. ",

    "body": "34 minutes agoLaura Gozzi and James ChaterUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he is ready for \"honest work\" with the US after receiving a draft peace plan to end the war with Russia. Several US media outlets report that under the plan, Kyiv would give up areas of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine that it still controls, cut the size of its army, and pledge never to join Nato.It was unclear how involved Ukraine has been in drafting the plan, but White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the US had engaged \"equally with both sides\". In a separate statement, Zelensky's office said that Ukraine had \"agreed to work on the plan's provisions in a way that would bring about a just end to the war\".If confirmed, the demands in the plan, would appear to favour Moscow's interests.Zelensky said he expects to speak with US President Donald Trump in the coming days about the proposals, which also include plans for Ukraine to forego many of its weapons.But in a press briefing at the White House, Leavitt rejected suggestions that the plan demanded major concessions from Ukraine, and said the US president \"supports\" it. US special envoy Steve Witkoff and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been working on a proposal quietly for about a month, and had engaged both sides \"to understand what these countries would commit to in order to see a lasting and durable peace\", Leavitt said.\"It's a good plan for both Russia and Ukraine,\" she added, without providing further details. \"We believe that it should be acceptable to both sides. And we're working very hard to get it done.\"A unnamed senior US official told CBS News that the plan \"was drawn up immediately following discussions with one of the most senior members of President Zelensky's administration, Rustem Umerov, who agreed to the majority of the plan, after making several modifications, and presented it to President Zelensky\". In a statement on X, Zelensky wrote, \"The American side presented points of a plan to end the war—their vision. I outlined our key principles. We agreed that our teams will work on the points to ensure it's all genuine.\"The statement came after a meeting in Kyiv on Thursday between Zelensky and senior US military figures, including US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, army chief of staff Gen Randy George and top US army commander in Europe Gen Chris Donahue.Despite Kyiv's tepid reaction to the draft, Zelensky said he \"appreciated the efforts of President Trump and his team to return security to Europe\" – perhaps a way to keep the US president onside despite his administration's apparent soft approach to Russia.In his nightly address on Thursday, Zelensky said Ukraine needs a \"worthy peace,\" and that the \"dignity of the Ukrainian people\" must be respected. When asked if Europe was involved in the process of drafting the plan, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, said: \"Not that I know of.\" \"For any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board,\" she added. Moscow downplayed the significance of the plan, which is rumoured to include 28 points. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that while there had been \"contacts\" with the US there was \"no process that could be called 'consultations'\".Peskov warned that any peace deal would have to address the \"root causes of the conflict\" - a phrase Moscow has used as shorthand for a series of maximalist demands which, to Ukraine, are tantamount to surrender. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"The future of Ukraine must be determined by Ukraine and we must never lose sight of that principle underpinning the just and lasting peace that we all want to see.\"Since starting his second term earlier this year, Trump has launched into various initiatives aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, including a bilateral summit with Putin in Alaska, several visits by his envoy Witkoff to Moscow, and rounds of talks with Zelensky and other Western leaders. But as the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine nears, the two sides remain deeply at odds over how to end the conflict. While Ukraine has become adept at targeting Russian military infrastructure and energy facilities with long-range drones, Moscow's attacks on Ukrainian targets continue unabated. Late on Thursday, a Russian attack on the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia killed at least five people, according to the regional governor. Earlier this week, at least 26 people were killed in a Russian missile and drone attack on blocks of flats in Ukraine's western city of Ternopil. Another 17 people were still missing at the site on Thursday, Zelensky said as he offered his condolences. ",

    "body": "Tears, walkouts and drama: New Miss Universe to be crowned as chaotic season ends5 hours agoJoel Guinto,in Singapore and Panisa Aemocha,in BangkokEPAThailand's Pravennar Singh is a fan favourite to win the crownWhen the golden crown studded with diamonds and pearls is placed on the head of the new Miss Universe in Thailand on Friday, it will mark the end of an exceptionally chaotic edition.In the days leading up to the glittering coronation in Bangkok, contestants alleging mistreatment walked out and two judges resigned with one claiming the contest is rigged.The controversies, analysts say, underscore the cultural and strategic differences between the pageant's Thai and Mexican owners.The crowning of the new Miss Universe, the 74th since 1952, also signals the resolve of an organisation to stay relevant and evolve from a once-a-year television spectacle to a media brand that is ready for TikTok.Miss Universe, founded in the US, is one of the longest-running beauty pageants on the planet, alongside UK-based Miss World.It aims to provide a platform for women to promote global causes such as HIV and Aids awareness and education for children. The title can also be a springboard to become a local and international celebrity.Thailand is hosting Miss Universe for the fourth time and its delegate this year is considered a frontrunner by fan websites. If Thai-Indian Praveenar Singh wins, she will be the country's third Miss Universe and the first since 1988.The country's 2018 staging of the pageant is regarded as among the best in recent years, so expectations were high for Thailand to outdo itself and put on a show.Getty ImagesThailand is hosting Miss Universe for the fourth timeDrama in BangkokThe pageant events are being organised by Thai media mogul Nawat Itsaragrasil, who is known to fans as the founder and owner of Miss Grand International, a smaller Thai-based contest that is known for its loud social media presence.Mr Nawat holds the licence to host this year's Miss Universe pageant, while the organisation is being run out of Mexico by businessman Raul Rocha. North, Central and South American queens dominated the contest in its early years, but recent decades have seen the rise of fandoms in South East Asia, most especially in Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia, where pageant crowns have become a way out of poverty or an express pass for girls dreaming of becoming a celebrity.But things took a dramatic turn at a pre-pageant ceremony early this month, when Mr Nawat told off Miss Mexico, Fatima Bosch, in front of dozens of contestants for failing to post promotional content.When she objected, Mr Nawat called security and threatened to disqualify those supporting her. Ms Bosch then left the room and others joined her in solidarity.The Miss Universe Organisation condemned Mr Nawat's behaviour as \"malicious\" and Mr Rocha, speaking by video from Mexico, told his Thai business partner to just \"stop\". Mr Nawat later apologised and claimed that some of his words were misunderstood - but a delegation of international executives were sent to take over running the competition.Watch: Miss Universe contestants stage walkout after organiser berates Miss MexicoA week later, two judges resigned with one of them accusing organisers of rigging the selection process.Lebanese-French musician Omar Harfouch, who announced his resignation from the eight-member jury on Instagram, alleged that an \"impromptu jury\" had pre-selected finalists ahead of the final on Friday. Hours later, former French football star Claude Makelele also announced he'd pulled out, citing \"unforeseen personal reasons\".The Miss Universe Organisation rejected Mr Harfouch's claims, saying that \"no external group has been authorised to evaluate delegates or select finalists\".It suggested that Mr Harfouch may have been referring to the Beyond the Crown programme - a \"social impact initiative\" that operates independently from the main Miss Universe competition, and has a separate selection committee.Then during the preliminary evening gown round on Wednesday night, Miss Jamaica accidentally fell onstage and had to be rushed out of the theatre in a stretcher. She is recovering in hospital.Turbulence at the topThe string of controversies comes as Miss Universe transitions to a new leadership after Thai transgender media mogul Anne Jakrajutatip resigned as CEO just before the pre-pageant events and was replaced by Guatemalan diplomat Mario Bucaro.Ms Jakrajutatip acquired the pageant from US entertainment company Endeavor in 2022. She made sweeping changes towards inclusivity, allowing transgender women, married women and women with children to participate. She also scrapped the age cap for contestants.As audiences declined over the years, she sought to monetise the Miss Universe brand, stamping it on merchandise such as bottled water and bags.In 2023, her entertainment company JKN, filed for bankruptcy, citing \"liquidity problems\".Getty ImagesFormer owner Anne Jakrajutatip sought to make Miss Universe more inclusiveBefore she resigned, Ms Jakrajutatip brought in Mr Rocha from Mexico as business partner and later tapped Mr Nawat to organise the 2025 pageant.It has been a \"very rocky transition\" for the pageant's leadership, Dani Walker, an American beauty queen and pageant coach told the BBC. She said important roles were now split between leaders in Bangkok and Mexico.The leadership structure was much clearer when the pageant was being run by Endeavor, and before that, Donald Trump, she said.\"For fans and outsiders, it's very confusing. No one knows who the real leaders are or who to ask when they have questions, and that's very damaging to the brand,\" Paula Shugart, who served as Miss Universe Organization president under the previous two owners, told the BBC.Thitiphong Duangkhong, a scholar of women's and Latin American studies and an expert on beauty pageants, said those behind the pageant should be aware of their cultural differences.\"In our country, we use the Thai language to communicate with our fellow Thais. We understand the social context, we understand social structure, we understand the inequality of power in society, and we constantly try to negotiate with it using the Thai language,\" he told the BBC.Mr Thitiphong said Ms Jakrajutatip being a transwoman might not have sat well with some Latin American fans who subscribe to macho culture.\"There's talk of women who aren't women suddenly buying a pageant that's supposed to be about women's entertainment. What's going to happen?\"What's next for Miss Universe?For years, audiences for the Miss Universe broadcast have been declining steadily as  fans to shift on social media. On TikTok and Instagram, former titleholders, even runners up, maintain accounts with millions of followers, transforming them into influencers.It is in this e-commerce universe that Mr Nawat's Miss Grand International queens are expected to embrace - selling merchandise in live broadcasts - which he tried to introduce to Miss Universe.But on the Latin American side, beauty queens are still regarded as glamorous television celebrities. A Miss Universe reality show was even staged for that audience and the winner - a Dominican crowned Miss Universe Latina - is competing in the main pageant in Bangkok.Getty Images'Miss Universe is worthless if you don't empower and support the women who compete,' says its former presidentBut while the controversies highlight the business side of Miss Universe, former queens continue to use their platform to promote their causes. The 2018 titleholder, Catriona Gray, urged her 13.8 million Instagram followers to help a charity bring safe drinking water to thousands left homeless by back-to-back super typhoons in the Philippines.Pageants also continue to face constant criticism for objectifying women. But while majority of contestants wore two piece bikinis for the 2025 contest, those from conservative countries were allowed to wear full-body covering in the swimsuit round.\"Of course, it won't be for everyone, and there will always be those who disagree. But as long as the core values ​​are intact, I think pageants will always have a role to play in society,\" said Ms Shugart, the former president.She said empowering women should be at the organisation's core.\"Miss Universe is nothing if you're not empowering the women that compete.\"",

    "body": "9 hours agoGeorgina Rannard and BBC climate team,Belém, BrazilThe UN climate talks COP30 have been evacuated due to a fire breaking out inside the venue in Belém, Brazil.BBC journalists saw flames and smoke in the pavilion area before they were rushed outside where fire engines raced past.The UN said the fire was extinguished after six minutes and 13 people were treated for smoke inhalation. It is not yet known what caused the blaze. The talks were in the final hours of trying to agree on next steps to tackle climate change but the fire has disrupted negotiations and the talks remain closed.\"It was climbing the walls and onto the ceiling. People were screaming,\" Dr Harshita Umesh, who was giving a talk next to the place where they fire broke out, told BBC News.\"Then I ran, I think I tripped and fell.\"Dr Umesh, who is a medical doctor, said that ambulance staff told her that first responders inhaled \"toxic fumes\" and were given oxygen masks to the site.Emergency medicine specialist Kimberly Humphrey, currently helping patients at the COP medical centre, told the BBC that the injuries are \"Mainly people with smoke inhalation, someone with a lung injury from smoke.\"\"People are pretty traumatised and shocked,\" she added.\"There's a huge panic, people have been running out of here, it's a very dramatic moment... UN security guards are telling us to leave,\" said BBC Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt shortly after the fire broke out.\"You can see huge columns of smoke rising up into the air through the hole that's been burnt in the top of the conference centre,\" he said.BBC journalists saw two ambulances driving towards the entrance more than 90 minutes after the fire started.A Brazilian security officer putting a chain through the gates of the venue with a chain told the BBC the premises must be evacuated and locked. After the fire broke out, orange flames burned a hole through the sheeting that covers the venue, which is in a former aerodrome. One video shows a man spraying a fire extinguisher at the fire before running away.One eyewitness told the BBC that he believes an electrical fire was the cause.A woman was taken away in a wheelchair, but it is not clear if that was connected to the fire.Hundreds of people were left sitting on the floor or on plastic chairs outside in high temperatures and humidity. The fire is likely to delay the closing of a deal in the talks.A number of country delegations were forced to take shelter outside under the roof of a petrol station, a member of the UK delegation told the BBC. He said the fire halted negotiations.The UN, which runs COP climate meetings, said the fire brigade is checking the venue to assess safety and that the summit has been temporarily taken over by Brazilian authorities.Thousands of people are attending the UN climate talks, including members of delegations from around the world.Nearly 200 countries are trying to agree on how to make progress in tackling climate change.

    "body": "12 hours agoMansur AbubakarAbujaReutersKanu was not in court when the verdict was delivered, after being removed for unruly behaviourA court in Nigeria has found separatist leader Nnamdi Kanu guilty of terrorism and other charges following a decade-long legal case full of drama.He has been given four life sentences, along with other terms, to be served concurrently. The prosecution had called for the death penalty but Judge James Omotosho said that executions were now \"frowned upon\".In his ruling he said he was satisfied that Kanu had made a series of broadcasts to incite violence and killings, as part of his campaign for a separate state in south-east Nigeria, known as Biafra.Kanu was convicted on all seven charges he faced. As well as terrorism, they included treason and involvement with an outlawed movement.Kanu always denied the charges and challenged the court's jurisdiction. At the start of the trial he sacked his lawyers but refused to defend himself.He was not in court when the verdict was delivered, after being removed for unruly behaviour.Security around the courthouse in the capital, Abuja, was tightened ahead of the verdict in case of protests by Kanu's supporters.Once a relatively obscure figure, he came to national prominence in 2009 when he started Radio Biafra, a station that called for an independent state for the Igbo people, broadcast to Nigeria from London.Though he grew up in south-eastern Nigeria, where he attended the University of Nsukka, Kanu moved to the UK before graduating, and acquired British nationality.In 2014, he set up the Indigenous People Of Biafra (Ipob), a movement demanding independence.Ipob was banned as a terrorist organisation in 2017. Its armed wing - the Eastern Security Network - has been accused of killings and other acts of violence in recent years.Delivering his judgement, Justice Omotosho said: \"Mr Kanu knew what he was doing, he was bent on carrying out these threats without consideration to his own people.\"From the incontroverted evidence, it is clear that the defendant carried out preparatory act of terrorism.\"He had the duty to explain himself but failed to do so.\"Kanu is a popular figure in his movement's heartland in south-eastern Nigeria, but reaction to the verdict there has so far been muted.In court ahead of the ruling, Kanu insisted that proceedings could not continue because he had not yet filed his final written address, accusing the judge of bias and not understanding the law.The judgement was delivered after Kanu had been forcibly removed from the courtroom for unruly behaviour.Getty ImagesNnamdi Kanu has a global network of supporters - this group had gathered in London earlier this month to demand his freedomHe was first arrested in October 2015 but he jumped bail in 2017 and left the country after a military raid on his home. The court later revoked his bail in March 2019.Two years later, the government announced that he had been re-arrested. His lawyers say he was detained in Kenya and forcibly returned to Nigeria. Kenya has not commented.In 2022, an appeal court ordered that the charges against him be dropped, saying he had been illegally arrested abroad, but this ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court the following year.The calls for Biafran independence date back many years. In 1967 Igbo leaders declared a Biafran state, but after a brutal civil war, which led to the deaths of up to a million people, the secessionist rebellion was defeated.Many Igbo people continue to feel that they are marginalised by the Nigerian state however, it is not clear how many are in favour of independence.Additional reporting from BBC Igbo's Ebere Ekeopara in EnuguMore about Nigeria from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "1 day agoHugh SchofieldParisNICOLAS TUCAT/AFP via Getty ImagesAmine Kessaci was 17 when his first brother was killed - now he has lost anotherA prominent French anti-drugs campaigner whose brother was killed by drugs criminals last week,  five years after the murder of his elder brother, has vowed to stand up to intimidation and \"keep telling the truth about drugs violence\".Amine Kessaci, 22, was writing in Le Monde newspaper a day after the funeral of his younger brother Mehdi, whose murder last week has been described by the government as a turning-point in France's drugs wars.\"Yesterday I lost my brother. Today I speak out,\" he wrote in his opinion piece.\"[The drugs-traffickers] strike at us in order to break, to tame, to subdue. They want to wipe out any resistance, to break any free spirit, to kill in the egg any embryo of revolt.\"Mehdi Kessaci, 20, was shot dead last Wednesday as he parked his car in central Marseille in what appears to have been a warning or punishment aimed at his older brother, Amine, from the city's drugs gangs.Speaking after a ministerial meeting on drugs crime at the Elysée palace on Tuesday, Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said: \"We all agreed that this premeditated murder was something totally new. It's clearly a crime of intimidation. It's a new level of violence.\"Mehdi was the second Kessaci brother to be killed by drugs criminals. In 2020 the body of Brahim Kessaci, then 22, was found in a burnt-out car. That murder prompted Amine to launch his association, Conscience, which aims to expose the damage to working-class communities caused by gangs.Marseille is renowned for worsening drugs wars, and Amine Kessaci recently wrote a book called Marseille Wipe your Tears – Life and Death in a Land of Drugs.AFP via Getty ImagesMehdi Kessaci, giving an interview last year at an event for his brotherIn his Le Monde article, Amine revealed he was recently warned by police to leave Marseille because of threats to his life. He attended his younger brother's funeral wearing a bullet-proof jacket and under heavy police protection.\"I speak because I have no choice but to fight if I don't want to die. I speak because I know that silence is the refuge of our enemies,\" he wrote, urging courage from citizens, and action from the government.Mehdi Kessaci's murder has brought the national spotlight back on a drugs trafficking problem that French experts and ministers agree is reaching almost unmanageable proportions.According to Senate member Étienne Blanc, author of a recent study, turnover in the drugs trade in France is now €7bn (£6bn) – or 70% of the entire budget of the justice ministry.He said around 250,000 people drew a living from the trade in France – more than the entire number of police and gendarmes, which is 230,000. According to Le Monde, the country counts 1.1 million users of cocaine.President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday launched a broadside against such consumers, telling the weekly cabinet meeting that \"sometimes it is the city-centre bourgeoisie that is funding the traffickers\".Macron had called a special drugs summit the day before in response to Mehdi's murder and in order to review progress on a new anti-drugs law that was passed in June.It sets up a special prosecutor's office dedicated to organised crime - similar to the office that tackles terrorism - which will eventually have 30 specialised magistrates.Under the law, senior drugs convicts are made to serve their terms in isolation in a specially converted prison where it is hoped it will be harder to continue running operations from behind bars.According to Laurent Nuñez, there is evidence that the crackdown on drugs crime is having an effect - with the number of homicides in Marseille down from 49 in 2023 to 24 in 2024. The number of dealing points in the city had halved from 160 to 80, he added.\"The war is not won, but we do have results.\"ALAIN JOCARD/AFP via Getty ImagesMembers of Parliament stand to pay tribute to Mehdi Kessaci on 13 NovemberAccording to the author of a recent book, Narcotraffic, Europe's poison, \"France is at the heart of the geopolitics of drugs. With its two major ports of Marseille and Le Havre, it has an ideal geographical position in this Europe of free movement.\"Mathieu Verboud said that the growth in world production of cocaine had triggered an \"explosion of supply and demand. The market has gone through the roof and so have the profits.\"The sheer wealth of drugs organisations meant they had the power to corrupt everyone from dock-workers to local politicians, the author warned, a process he said was already well-advanced in countries like the Netherlands and Belgium.Several French politicians have said it is time to call in the army to deal with drugs-trafficking and the gangs which hold sway in many high-immigration city estates.Christian Estrosi, mayor of the southern coastal city of Nice, said: \"Narcotrafficking has transformed into narcoterrorism. Its aim now is to terrorise, subjugate and rule.\"We have already successfully deployed the means to fight terrorism. It's time to act with determination against narcoterrorism.\"Estrosi was referring to wave of deadly jihadist attacks in the mid 2010s, when France deployed hundreds of soldiers on to the streets of many cities where they continue to patrol.",

    "body": "Police in Mexico have arrested a man they accuse of being the mastermind behind the murder of a popular mayor. Carlos Manzo, the mayor of Uruapan, was shot dead on 1 November at a public event marking the Day of the Dead.Manzo was an outspoken critic of cartel violence in his home state of Michoacán and his assassination triggered mass protests.Mexico's security minister said the man suspected of ordering his murder had links to the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG).\"This arrest represents a key step in dismantling the criminal structure responsible for this attack,\" Security Minister Omar García Harfuch said.He did not say what the possible motive of the attack may have been, but local officials in Mexico are often targeted by criminal gangs for failing to do their bidding.García Harfuch said the suspect, whom he named as Jorge Amando, withholding his surname, had been the one who had ordered the deadly attack on Carlos Manzo. He said that Jorge Amando, who is also known as The Graduate, had communicated with those who carried out the killing via WhatsApp. According to the official, The Graduate pressured his men to open fire on Manzo even if he was surrounded by people.The 40-year-old mayor was attending a Day of the Dead ceremony - which honours deceased family and friends - alongside his relatives when he was shot seven times, sending bystanders running for cover. Manzo had spoken out publicly about how avocado growers in the region were being extorted and threatened by criminal groups.He had also demanded that Mexico's federal government, led by President Claudia Sheinbaum, do more to rein in cartels who hold sway in much of the state. The Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which Mexico's security minister blamed for the attack on Manzo, engages in drug trafficking as well as kidnapping for ransom and extortion.It is also infamous for targeting public officials who refuse to do its bidding.While the CJNG is thought to be the most powerful of the criminal gangs operating in Michoacán, there are many others and their fights for control of drug, arms and fuel smuggling routes often result in deadly confrontations.The assassination of Manzo triggered mass protests.At one large rally in Mexico City last weekend, many of the protesters carried placards with the photo of the mayor, while other held up banners reading \"we are all Carlos Manzo\".Some of the protesters clashed with police in Mexico's central Zócalo square.

    "body": "1 day agoSoutik BiswasIndia correspondentLightRocket via Getty ImagesFor India, few friendships have been as strategically valuable - and as politically costly - as its long embrace of Bangladesh's former leader Sheikh Hasina. During 15 years in power she delivered what Delhi prizes most in its periphery: stability, connectivity and a neighbour willing to align its interests with India's rather than China's. These days she is across the border in India but has been sentenced to death by a special tribunal in Bangladesh for crimes against humanity over her crackdown on student-led protests, which led to her ousting.The 2024 demonstrations forced her to flee and paved the way for Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to lead an interim government. Elections are due early next year.The fallout from all this has created a diplomatic bind: Dhaka wants Hasina extradited, but Delhi has shown no inclination to comply - making her death sentence effectively unenforceable. What Delhi intended as humanitarian asylum is turning into a long and uncomfortable test of how far it is willing to go for an old ally, and how much diplomatic capital it is prepared to burn in the process.Michael Kugelman, a South Asia expert, says India faces four unappealing options. It could hand Hasina over - \"which it really doesn't want to do\". It could maintain the status quo, though that will become \"increasingly risky for Delhi once a newly elected government takes office next year\". Or, it could press Hasina to stay silent and avoid statements or interviews, something she is \"unlikely to accept\" as she continues to lead her Awami League party - and something Delhi is unlikely to enforce.The remaining option is to find a third country to take her in, but that too is fraught: few governments are likely to accept a \"high-maintenance guest with serious legal problems and security needs\", Mr Kugelman says.Extraditing Hasina is unthinkable - India's ruling party and opposition alike view her as a close friend. \"India prides itself on not turning on its friends,\" according to Mr Kugelman.What makes this moment especially awkward for Delhi is the sheer depth - and asymmetry - of the India–Bangladesh relationship, rooted in India's pivotal role in Bangladesh's birth.Getty ImagesA student-led uprising toppled Hasina, forcing her to flee Bangladesh last yearBangladesh is India's biggest trading partner in South Asia, and India has become Bangladesh's largest export market in Asia. Total trade reached nearly $13bn (£10bn) last year, with Bangladesh running a sizeable deficit, heavily dependent on Indian raw materials, energy and transit routes.India has offered $8bn-$10bn in concessional credit over the past decade, provides duty-free access to some goods, built cross-border rail links, and supplies electricity - plus oil and LNG - from Indian grids and ports. This is not a relationship either side can easily walk away from.\"India and Bangladesh share a complex interdependence - relying on each other for water, electricity and more. It would be difficult for Bangladesh to function without India's co-operation,\" says Sanjay Bhardwaj, a professor of South Asian studies at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.Yet, many believe, Bangladesh's interim government, under Yunus, appears to now be moving quickly to rebalance its external ties. His first months in office have been a burst of diplomatic outreach aimed at \"de-Indianising\" Bangladesh's foreign policy, according to political scientist Bian Sai in a paper published by the National University of Singapore.A government that once aligned itself with India at every regional forum is now cancelling judicial exchanges, renegotiating Indian energy deals, slowing India-led connectivity projects, and leaning publicly on Beijing, Islamabad and even Ankara for strategic partnership. Many believe the message could not be clearer: Bangladesh, once India's most dependable neighbour, is hedging hard.The deterioration is already visible in public sentiment. A recent survey by the Dhaka-based Centre for Alternatives found more than 75% of Bangladeshis viewed ties with Beijing positively, compared with just 11% for Delhi - reflecting sentiments after last year's uprising. Many blame Delhi for supporting an increasingly authoritarian Hasina in her final years, and see India as an overbearing neighbour.Prof Bharadwaj says that long-standing economic and cultural ties often endure beyond political shifts: data show that trade between India and Bangladesh grew between 2001 and 2006, when the \"less friendlier\" Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), in coalition with Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI), was in power.\"While diplomatic and political relations often fluctuate with changes in government, economic, cultural and sports ties tend to remain largely stable. Even if a new administration is less friendly toward India, it does not automatically disrupt trade or broader bilateral relations,\" he says.For Delhi, the challenge is not just managing a fallen ally in exile, but preserving a neighbour central to its security - from counterterrorism and border management to access to its restive north-eastern region. India shares a 4,096km (2,545 mile) largely porous and partly riverine border with Bangladesh, where domestic turbulence could trigger displacement or mobilisation of extremists, experts say. \"India should not be in a hurry,\" says Avinash Paliwal, who teaches politics and international studies at SOAS University of London. The path forward, he argues, requires \"quiet, patient engagement with key political stakeholders in Dhaka -including the armed forces\". Diplomacy can buy time.Leon Neal/Getty ImagesMuhammad Yunus is the leader of an interim government in Bangladesh Dr Paliwal believes the relationship is likely to remain turbulent over the next 12–18 months, with the intensity depending on developments in Bangladesh after next year's elections.\"If the interim government is able to pull off elections with credibility, and an elected government takes charges, it could open options for the two sides to renegotiate the relationship and limit the damage.\"The uncertainty has Delhi weighing not just immediate tactical moves, but the broader principle: How can India reassure friendly governments that it will stand by them \"through thick and thin\" without inviting accusations that it is shielding leaders with troubling human rights records?\"There are no silver-bullet operational solutions to this dilemma. Perhaps the deeper question that requires mulling is why India faces the dilemma in the first place,\" says Dr Paliwal. In other words, did Delhi put too many eggs in one basket by backing Hasina so consistently?\"You deal with whoever is in power, is friendly, and helps you get your job done. Why should you change that?\" says Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty, former Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh. \"Foreign policy isn't driven by public perception or morality - relations between states rarely are.\"Internally, we can't control Bangladesh's politics - it's fractious, deeply divisive, and built on fragile institutions.\"Whether India can repair the deeper political rupture remains uncertain. At the same time, much depends on Bangladesh's next government. \"The key is how much Bangladesh's next government lets the Hasina factor impact bilateral relations. If it essentially holds the relationship hostage, then it will be tough to move forward,\" says Mr Kugelman.Ultimately, the next elected government will need to balance Bangladesh's core interests - border security, trade and connectivity - against domestic politics and public anti-India sentiment, he says.\"I don't anticipate a serious crisis in ties, but I suspect they'll remain fragile at best.\"",

    "body": "15 hours agoTom Geoghegan and James FitzGeraldGetty ImagesJeffrey Epstein in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 2004The words \"Epstein files\" have been haunting the administration of US President Donald Trump for months as it grapples with a growing crisis over the crimes of late convicted sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein.Pressure was building from Trump's own supporters and from voices within his own Republican Party for more transparency on what the federal investigations into Epstein uncovered.After weeks of resisting release, Trump reversed course and urged Republicans to vote to open the Epstein files to public scrutiny. Both chambers of Congress - the legislative branch of US government - approved a measure that compels the US justice department to release all files pertaining to its investigation into Epstein.The following day, Trump announced in a social media post that he had signed a bill that approved the release of the files. Now, the justice department has 30 days to release all the files - except for those that relate to an active criminal investigation, identify victims of Epstein's abuse or invade their privacy, or contain images of physical and child sex abuse, death, or injury.What are the Epstein files?In 2008, Epstein reached a plea deal with prosecutors after the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police in Florida that Epstein had molested their daughter at his Palm Beach home.Photos of girls were found throughout the house, and he was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor, for which he was registered as a sex offender. He escaped a heavy jail sentence as a result of the deal.Eleven years later, he was charged with running a network of underage girls for sex. He died in prison while awaiting trial and his death was ruled a suicide.These two criminal investigations amassed a vast trove of documents including transcripts of interviews with victims and witnesses, and items confiscated from raids on his various properties.The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) found over 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence in its databases, hard drives and other storage, according to a 2025 memo from the justice department. While some of the files likely include materials gathered by prosecutors working at federal level and Florida state level to investigate Epstein, the justice department says there is a \"large volume\" of images and videos of victims and other illegal child abuse material. These files would not be released to the public, as the latest legislation passed by Congress allows the justice department to withhold information that identifies victims. There was also a separate investigation into his British co-conspirator and ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 of conspiring with Epstein to traffic girls for sex.Both Epstein and Maxwell were also the subject of civil cases.Watch: \"It's exhausting\" - Epstein accuser talks to the BBC about files sagaWhat has already been released on Epstein?At various stages over the years, some materials have been put into the public domain.Last week, thousands of documents belonging to the Epstein estate were released by the House Oversight Committee, mostly emails.That was not the first tranche released by the House Oversight Committee since it subpoenaed Epstein's estate earlier in the year.An earlier release, in September, included a birthday book containing a note to Epstein bearing Trump's name, which he has denied writing.In February, weeks after Trump took office, the Department of Justice and the FBI released what they described at the time as the \"first phase of the declassified Epstein files\".A group of right-wing influencers were invited to the White House, but they were left disappointed when they realised that the 341 pages handed to them were mostly material already out there.It included flight logs from Epstein's plane and a redacted version of his contacts book containing the names of famous people he knew.In July, the Department of Justice and FBI said in a memo that no more material would be released. That is now poised to change.What happens now that Trump has approved release?The vote in the House of Representatives was forced by a discharge petition getting its critical 218th signature to trigger action on the floor.Four Republicans and all 214 Democrats in the House signed the petition.The vote to release the files took place on 18 November and the bill passed 427-to-1 in the House. Republican lawmaker Clay Higgins of Louisiana was the sole no vote. A handful of legislators did not vote.Once the bill passed in the lower chamber of Congress, it swiftly moved to the Senate where it passed via unanimous consent - a procedure that speeds up the legislative process if there is no objection. It was then signed off by Trump.There are still several hurdles to the full release of the files. Attorney General Pam Bondi will be required to release all materials and documents related to Epstein and Maxwell within 30 days of the law being enacted. But Bondi has the power to withhold any information that could jeopardise a federal investigation or identify Epstein's victims.The document that went before the House states that the attorney general could withhold or redact personal information that \"would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\".Trump has repeatedly called for an investigation into senior figures among the Democrats. Republicans have said that they fear that investigations into Epstein's links could block or delay details in the files. Representative Thomas Massie said he was concerned that a \"flurry of investigations\" could be opened as a way to avoid releasing the information. Getty ImagesEpstein with Maxwell in 2005Who is named in the Epstein files?The contents of the unreleased documents remain unknown.According to The Wall Street Journal, Trump was told by Bondi in May that his name appeared in FBI documents.He used to be friends with Epstein and the paper noted that being named in the files was not evidence of wrongdoing.A White House spokesman called the story \"fake\", although an unnamed official speaking to Reuters news agency said the administration did not dispute that Trump's name had been included.Existing materials in the public domain mention a number of high-profile figures connected to Epstein.Again, this does not imply any wrongdoing by those individuals.Dozens of names came up in a release of court documents in 2024, including Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former prince and brother of King Charles III, former US President Bill Clinton and Michael Jackson.Both Clinton and the British royal deny any knowledge of Epstein's crimes. Jackson died in 2009.The release of those documents related to the case of Maxwell, who is serving 20 years in prison for child sex trafficking.Billionaire Elon Musk and Mr Mountbatten-Windsor were named in flight logs released in September.Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has previously strenuously denied any wrongdoing. Mr Musk has been quoted as saying that Epstein invited him to the island but he declined.The latest batch of emails belonging to the Epstein estate and released on 12 November also featured Clinton's former Treasury Secretary, Larry Summers, and Trump's former aide Steve Bannon.Summers later said he would be stepping back from public commitments, writing in a statement: \"I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein.\"Mr Bannon, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, did not reply to the BBC's request for comment. Trump's name was also mentioned several times in that latest release. He has always denied any wrongdoing.What do we know about the Trump/Epstein relationship?Trump and Epstein appear to have been friends for a number of years, keeping a similar social circle.Previously released files show that Trump's details were in Epstein's \"black book\" of contacts. Flight logs also showed Trump flying on Epstein's plane on several occasions.They were pictured together at elite events in the 1990s, and photos published by CNN purport to show Epstein in attendance at Trump's wedding to then-wife Marla Maples.In 2002, Trump described Epstein as a \"terrific guy\". Epstein would later remark: \"I was Donald's closest friend for 10 years.\"According to Trump, they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. By 2008, Trump was saying that he had not been \"a fan of his\".The White House has suggested that their fallout was connected to Epstein's behaviour, and that \"the president kicked him out of his club for being a creep\".The Washington Post, meanwhile, has suggested that the breakdown in their relationship was due to their rivalry over some real estate in Florida.Why are people so interested in Epstein?Die-hard members of Trump's MAGA movement have long believed officials are hiding key truths about Epstein's life and death.Some of them have theorised that a child-molesting cabal has been operating at the highest levels of US society, protected by the state. The theory spread through cryptic messages posted by a pseudonymous character called Q.In one of the conspiracy theories pushed by some MAGA influencers, Epstein was an agent of the Israeli government.Some Trump allies have tried to quell the backlash. Last month, the Republican-controlled House announced an early recess for the chamber, stalling efforts to force the release of Epstein-related documents within 30 days. There are several unanswered questions about Epstein shared by the wider population too - particularly why he was given such a lenient sentence in Florida, whether he and Maxwell were really acting alone, and how he was allowed to take his own life in prison.",

    "body": "Ukrainian teen saboteurs recruited on Telegram to attack their own country1 day agoBBC Trending and BBC News UkrainianSBU'Vlad' was under surveillance when he planted a bomb in a vanIn July this year a 17-year-old travelled 500 miles from his home in eastern Ukraine to collect a bomb and a phone hidden in a park in the western city of Rivne.He says he was promised $2,000 (£1,520) to plant the bomb in a van used by Ukraine's military conscription service.\"When I was connecting the wires, I thought it could explode then. I thought I might die,\" he told the BBC.Vlad is one of hundreds of children and older teenagers who the Ukrainian government alleges have been recruited online by Russia, and offered payment to carry out sabotage and other attacks against their own country. His name has been changed to protect his anonymity.He says he was told to set up the phone to live-stream the scene to his handler so they could remotely detonate the device when somebody entered the vehicle.However, Ukraine's SBU security service had been watching and foiled the attack. Vlad - now 18 - is awaiting trial on terrorism charges that potentially carry a 12-year prison sentence.Sitting in Rivne's heavily guarded detention centre with his lawyer beside him, he acknowledges that he could have helped kill somebody.\"I did think about it. But nobody likes conscription officers,\" he says. \"I thought: Well, I'll be like everyone else.\"The SBU says that over the last two years more than 800 Ukrainians have been identified as having been recruited by Russia - 240 of them minors, some as young as 11.However, cyber security expert Anastasiia Apetyk, who teaches courses about internet safety in Ukraine, is aware of even younger cases. \"They tried to recruit children aged nine or 10,\" she says.SBUSBU officers visit a Kyiv school to warn teenagers against becoming saboteursAndriy Nebytov, Deputy Head of Ukraine's National Police, says there is a deliberate strategy to seek out the vulnerable who can be manipulated.\"Children do not always fully realise the consequences of their actions,\" he says.\"The enemy is not ashamed of using minors for making explosives out of household chemicals, planting them in various locations such as army recruitment offices or police stations.\"The SBU says recruitment primarily takes place on the Telegram app, but also on TikTok, and even on video game platforms. Officials says those who are recruited are almost always motivated by money rather than pro-Russian sympathies.Vlad says he does not support Russia and had no previous involvement with crime.He had joined two Telegram channels and posted that he was looking for remote work. Within half an hour, a man calling himself Roman replied. When they later talked on the phone, Vlad says Roman spoke Russian with a street accent.SBUVlad was paid a fraction of the cryptocurrency he was promisedVlad says he was initially reluctant but was persuaded to take on a series of increasingly dangerous tasks. First, he was told to collect a grenade but when he reached the designated location it wasn't there. He was paid $30 anyway.A few days later came another job - to set fire to a van belonging to a conscription centre, film it and run.For that attack, Vlad says he received about $100 in cryptocurrency - much less than the $1,500 he'd been promised. Roman told him he would get the rest if he planted the bomb in Rivne.Cash for chaosThe Telegram channels the BBC has seen where recruitment takes place are not explicitly pro-Russian, but they amplify anger felt by some Ukrainians towards the conscription service, which has been dogged by allegations of brutality and corruption. Using a burner phone and an alias we joined several we were tipped off about.The channels contained clips of fires and explosions which they claimed were carried out on their orders. But the BBC has not been able to verify the circumstances surrounding those videos.TelegramSome Telegram channels offer a scale of payments for attacking different targetsOne account we contacted immediately offered payment, either in cryptocurrency or via bank transfer, to carry out arson. We were told to contact a second account for more details and then received a message with a price list detailing how much they offered to pay for different targets.The payments ranged from $1,500 for setting fire to a post office to $3,000 for a bank. Banks were worth more, they explained, because security glass made them harder to attack.\"You either need to pour petrol inside or throw a few Molotov cocktails inside,\" the account advised.But even ordinary Ukrainians looking for employment can find themselves offered money to carry out sabotage.We found adverts offering high pay for unspecified part time work posted in a variety of unrelated Ukrainian Telegram groups, including some geared at refugees and even beauty tips. When we followed one up, a recruiter again offered thousands of dollars for arson attacks and asked us to send videos as proof.\"I need all the arson I can get,\" they messaged. \"Finding a reliable person is far more difficult than parting with money. That's why I pay exactly what I say and I do it very quickly, usually within a couple of hours after receiving the video.\"The BBC reported a number of these channels, accounts, chats and bots to Telegram, which removed a few but not most of them. One of the channels that is still active has grown by over 750 subscribers since we started monitoring it, meanwhile an account that we told Telegram had directly offered us payment for an arson attack is still live. In a statement, Telegram said: \"Calls to violence or destruction of property are explicitly forbidden on Telegram and are immediately removed whenever discovered.\"SBUAn SBU video warns teenagers they face jail if the carry out sabotage for RussiaUkrainian officials have publicly named members of Russia's intelligence agencies they suspect of acting as handlers to saboteurs.The BBC has not been able to independently verify that the Russian state itself is responsible.However, several European governments have said that they have evidence of Russian agents recruiting young men to carry out acts of vandalism, arson, or even surveillance in their countries. In the UK, six men were jailed for their part in a Russian-ordered arson attack on a London warehouse providing aid to Ukraine.In Ukraine, hundreds of alleged saboteurs are awaiting trial, but for some the consequences can be deadly. Several suspects have been killed by explosives they were carrying. SBUOne teenager was killed and another injured in an explosion in Ivano-FrankivskThe SBU claims Russian handlers have deliberately detonated devices remotely, knowing their agents would be killed.In March, a 17-year-old died and a 15-year-old was badly injured when a bomb they were believed to be taking to a rail station in Ivano-Frankivsk exploded.The BBC put the SBU's allegations to the Russian Embassy in London. In a statement it accused Ukraine of a similar sabotage campaign using Russian citizens.\"The practices that you mention have become a trademark of the Ukrainian special services. In particular: recruitment of civilians, including children, to carry out arson, sabotage or bombings against people, buildings or vehicles.\"There have been reports attributing acts of sabotage inside Russia to Ukrainian recruitment on Telegram. But again, it is notoriously difficult to verify who exactly is behind these attacks.Meanwhile Vlad has a message for others tempted by the recruiters.\"It's not worth it. They will either cheat you, and then you will end up in prison just like me, or you can take a bomb in your hands and it will simply blow you up.\"",

    "body": "21 hours agoRushdi Abualouf,Gaza correspondent, in Istanbul and David GrittenAt least 25 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, the Hamas-run health ministry has said, in what was one of the deadliest days since the ceasefire came into effect five weeks ago.Ten people were killed when a ministry of religious endowments building in the eastern Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City was hit, according to rescuers.Israel's military said it struck \"Hamas terrorist targets\" after gunmen opened fire towards an area where its soldiers were operating in the southern city of Khan Younis in violation of the ceasefire deal.Hamas questioned the claim and denounced what it said was a \"dangerous escalation\" that could jeopardise the ceasefire.The flare-up of violence comes after the UN Security Council passed a resolution that endorsed US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan to end two years of devastating war.Mahmoud Bassal, a spokesman for Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency, told the BBC that Israeli air, drone and artillery strikes hit several locations in Gaza City and Khan Younis shortly after sunset on Wednesday.The attacks marked a sharp escalation after several days of relative calm, he said.The Civil Defence reported that the strike in Zeitoun caused severe damage to the religious endowments ministry's building and surrounding structures, and posted a video showing its rescue workers appearing to find two people buried under rubble.Photos published by the Anadolu news agency meanwhile showed the bodies of three young children reportedly recovered from the scene.In a separate incident in Gaza City, one person was killed and several others were wounded when a drone struck a group of people at Shejaiya junction on Salah al-Din Street, Gaza's main north-south road, according to Mr Bassal.He said another person was killed when a tank shell struck a house belonging to the Balboul family in Shejaiya's Mushtaha Street, which is also in eastern Gaza City.The Civil Defence reported that another 13 people were killed in the Khan Younis area.Mr Bassal said three of them were killed in a strike on a group inside a sports club run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa).In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that \"several terrorists opened fire toward the area where IDF soldiers are operating in Khan Younis\" earlier on Wednesday.\"This action constitutes a violation of the ceasefire agreement. No IDF injuries were reported,\" it added. \"In response, the IDF began striking Hamas terrorist targets across the Gaza Strip.\"Israeli public broadcaster Kan cited a security source as saying the targets of the strikes were the commander of the Zeitoun Battalion of Hamas's military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, and the commander of its naval force.Hamas denounced the Israeli strikes, saying in a statement that it considered them a \"dangerous escalation through which the war criminal [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu seeks to resume the genocide against our people\".It also urged the US to \"honour its stated commitments and exert immediate pressure on Israel to enforce the ceasefire and halt its attacks\".But a US official told Reuters news agency that Hamas was aiming to break the ceasefire and not fulfil its commitment to disarm.On Monday, the UN Security Council passed a resolution that sought to shore up the fragile ceasefire, which took effect on 10 October.Member states authorised the creation of a transitional governance body called the Board of Peace, which will be chaired by President Trump, and a temporary International Stabilisation Force (ISF), which will be tasked with ensuring \"the process of demilitarizing the Gaza Strip\".Trump hailed the resolution as \"a moment of true historic proportion\".Hamas reiterated that it would not give up its weapons without a Palestinian state, arguing its fight against Israel was legitimate \"resistance\".Israel's ambassador to the UN stressed the importance of disarmament, saying that his country would \"not stop or let up\" until Hamas no longer presented \"a threat\".The Israeli military launched an offensive in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 69,500 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, including 280 during the ceasefire, according to the territory's health ministry.The Israeli military has said three of its soldiers have been killed in attacks in Gaza since the ceasefire began and that its has targeted scores of fighters.On Wednesday afternoon, Israel's military also carried out several strikes in southern Lebanon saying it targeted weapons storage facilities belonging to Hezbollah.Israel accuses the Iran-backed armed group of trying to rebuild its capabilities following a war that ended last November.",

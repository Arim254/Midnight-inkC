    "body": "2 hours agoAleks PhillipsandNikos PapanikolaouGetty ImagesThessaloniki Airport closed entirely after air traffic communication was knock outThousands of passengers are stranded across Europe after a communications failure forced Greece to close its airspace, causing widespread cancellations and delays.Officials are working to understand why radio communications were disrupted on Sunday morning, prompting the temporary suspension of arrivals and departures.Some departures have since been allowed to resume - though inbound flights are still being told to divert or return to their point of origin. Athens' main airport is among the worst affected, while Thessaloniki airport has closed entirely.The timing of the disruption has raised fears that travellers will not be able to get home before the start of the working week.\"I was supposed to fly to London, via Stockholm, with SAS,\" one passenger at Athens International Airport told Greek broadcaster Mega TV. \"I'm working on Newport Hospital tomorrow morning. I'm not going to be there on time, I don't know what else to say. \"Who is going to pay for the additional cost this travel will cost me? We still don't know if and when we're going to leave, no one is telling us anything.\"More than 90 flights have been affected in and out of Athens airport alone - though some flights have since been able to resume.A member of staff in the airport told the BBC that 35 aircraft an hour were now being allowed to take off, but it was still unable to take inbound flights.Flights departing from Dublin, Barcelona and Paris were earlier ordered to return to their airports of origin, while services from Copenhagen and Malta were cancelled altogether. Other arrivals into Athens were placed on standby, while flights in and out of other Greek airports have also been affected. Three flights out of Heraklion airport on the island of Crete, including one to Munich, have been delayed, according to public broadcaster ERT.Most inbound flights are being diverted to Turkey if not cancelled outright, it reports.Reuters / Flightradar24Greek airspace was nearly empty earlier on Sunday due to the technical faultThe disruption comes at a busy time for air travel in and out of Athens, which typically sees more than 600 scheduled flights per day, as people return from winter holidays.In the chaos, some passengers have complained of a lack of information. One told news site Flash: \"We have no updates. They told us that we will be able to leave but I don't think this is true. On the departures board I can't see my flight, and I'm supposed to leave shortly.\"Another, who had been on a flight to Rhodes when it turned around and headed back to Athens, told news agency Reuters: \"From that moment until now we have no information whatsoever.\"Domestic travellers may have the option of getting home on Greece's rail network, but this would take significantly longer.The issue that caused the disruption is thought to concern the radio system used by air traffic controllers to communicate with planes in their airspace.Panagiotis Psarros, chair of the Association of Greek Air Traffic Controllers, told ERT that all frequencies were \"suddenly lost\", adding: \"We could not communicate with aircraft in the sky.\"The broadcaster later reported than an initial investigation by the Greek security services suggested the problem may be due to the failure of an antenna in the Gerania Mountains near Athens. Italy, Turkey and Cyprus are assisting Greece in managing the situation.",

    "body": "The charity Brigitte Bardot established has issued a warning about \"scam\" merchandise purporting to fund its work following the French actress's death.The Brigitte Bardot Foundation said it was aware of \"crude fabrications\" being advertised online alongside claims the proceeds will go to the animal welfare charity.It threatened to take legal action against anyone taking part in \"these alleged illegal fundraising efforts\", stating: \"Everyone is asked to respect the memory of the deceased.\"Bardot died aged 91 last Sunday. After revolutionising 1950s French cinema and becoming a symbol of sexual liberation, she quit acting to devote her life to animals.But the actress-turned-activist courted controversy later in life over a string of remarks about Muslims, gay people and the #MeToo movement. She was fined five times for inciting racial hatred.Her death prompted tributes in France, with President Emmanuel Macron saying the nation was mourning \"a legend of the century\".\"Her films, her voice, her dazzling glory, her initials, her sorrows, her generous passion for animals, her face that became Marianne, Brigitte Bardot embodied a life of freedom,\" he said.But now, online scammers were co-opting her iconic image for \"vulgar and despicable attempts to exploit her legacy\", the Brigitte Bardot Foundation said.It warned of \"the spread on the internet and social networks of offers for sale of photographs, AI-assisted montages, and all kinds of media\" reproducing her image, including \"in fabricated situations\".\"These are crude fabrications, illicit offers and sales, and purported fundraising campaigns that have never received any endorsement from the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, which cannot condone these scams,\" it wrote in a statement on Saturday.Bardot starred in nearly 50 films including And God Created Woman and Contempt, setting fashion trends with her tousled blonde hair and bold eyeliner, before becoming the model for Marianne, the personified symbol of France.She retired from acting in 1973, aged 39, declaring: \"I gave my youth and beauty to men, I give my wisdom and experience to animals.\" Bardot would go on to launch her animal rights foundation 13 years later.Her funeral will take place on Wednesday in Saint-Tropez, southern France, where she lived for decades, in a cemetery overlooking her home and the Mediterranean.The Brigitte Bardot Foundation told French news agency AFP that the private burial  will be \"no frills\" and \"without fuss\", in keeping with her spirit.",

    "body": "5 hours agoTom McArthurGetty ImagesA national day of mourning has been announced in Switzerland for 9 JanuaryThe bodies of 16 more victims of a bar fire in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana have been identified by police.The youngest person was a Swiss girl aged 14, with nine aged under 18. The group includes people of Swiss, Italian, Romanian, Turkish and French nationalities, police said.This brings the number of people who have been identified as killed in the fire to 24.  Among them is 16-year-old Swiss national Arthur Brodard, his mother has said.A criminal investigation into the people who ran Le Constellation bar is under way, while victim's families are enduring an agonising wait for information about loved ones who are still considered missing.Police said no further details will be released about the victims they had identified out of respect for their relatives.However, Arthur Brodard's mother took to Facebook on Saturday night to announce that he \"has left to party in paradise\".\"We can start our mourning, knowing that he is in peace and in the light,\" she said as she appeared visibly upset in a video message.While Arthur was still presumed missing and information on his whereabouts was scarce, Ms Brodard-Sitre told local newspaper Le Temps that she had been \"living a nightmare\".Some of his friends had been found with burns covering nearly half their bodies, she told the newspaper. \"There are no words - they went through hell.\"Laetitia Brodard-Sitre/FacebookArthur Brodard's mother posted a moving tribute to her sonSparklers on bottles being carried too close to the ceiling are the likely cause of the fire during New Year's celebrations at the bar, a preliminary investigation has found. The devastating fire killed at least 40 people and injured 119 others. Many of the dead and missing are teenagers. Le Constellation was a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16.The eight identified and returned to their families on Saturday were all aged between 16 and 24, Swiss authorities said.SUPPLIEDVideo from inside the bar appears to show the moment the ceiling covering caught fireOn Saturday, the Italian ambassador to to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado, said the identification process was slow because of the severity of the burns many victims had suffered.The French couple who own the bar - named by the media as Jacques and Jessica Moretti - are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office for the Valais region said.Beatrice Pilloud, Valais canton lead prosecutor, said in a statement that investigators were looking into whether the acoustic foam on the venue's ceiling was \"the cause of the problem\", as well as \"whether it complies with regulations\".Italian media named junior golfer Emanuele Galeppini, 16, as the first identified victim of the fire following a statement from the Italian Golf Federation paying tribute to the \"young athlete who carried with him passion and authentic values\".His father is quoted as saying his son was at Le Constellation. A spokesperson for the Italian foreign ministry previously told the BBC it would not confirm the death.",

    "body": "Nigerian officials have announced that schools in Niger state will start reopening later this month, following a mass abduction in November that forced their closure as part of emergency security measures.From 12 January, public and private schools \"in safe and secure areas\" will be allowed to reopen, Niger state's education ministry said in a statement.The decision follows security assessments and \"extensive consultations\" with security agencies, it added.November's kidnapping of more than 250 students and staff from St Mary's Catholic school in Papiri, western Nigeria, was one of the country's worst abductions to date.Officials confirmed that all of the missing students and teachers had been rescued just before Christmas. It was not formally made public how the government secured their release, or whether any ransom was paid to their abductors.For years, armed criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, have carried out killings and kidnappings across many parts of Nigeria - but reports in the north-central region have spiked recently.Schools and places of worship have increasingly been targeted there.The government has recently classified the criminal groups as terrorists, and while paying ransom money is illegal in Nigeria, there are claims this is often ignored.More than 1,500 children have been abducted from the country's schools since 2014, when 276 girls were taken during the infamous Chibok mass abduction.It is not yet clear which schools will be reopening, however the state's education ministry said a list would be released.Those deemed to be in \"unsafe or insecure areas\" will remain closed until the security situation has been assessed, the statement said.For those welcoming students back, every child will have to be registered as soon as classes resume and the data sent to the education ministry within a week.Local officials have also been ordered to ensure an \"adequate security presence in and around school premises\" to help protect students from future attacks.But just one day after officials announced the schools' reopening, gunmen attacked a village in Niger state, killing at least 30 people and kidnapping several others, police said. Saturday's attack on the town of Kasuwan-Daji saw armed men emerge from a forest, burn down the local market and loot shops, they added.Residents were gathered, tied up and attacked with knives, Abdullahi Rofia, an official with the Niger State Emergency Management Agency, told the BBC.He said people in the community were terrified: \"They are hiding, they are too afraid to talk to anybody.\"They are scared that if you talk, they will turn and do the same to you.\"Additional reporting by Richard Kagoe and Makuochi Okafor",

    "body": "6 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture correspondentThe composer of the musical Wicked has said he will not appear at the Kennedy Center after its board voted to include US President Donald Trump's name in the name of the venue.Stephen Schwartz said in a statement that appearing at the centre \"has now become an ideological statement\", adding: \"As long as that remains the case, I will not appear there.\"But Richard Grenell, the center's president, wrote on X that the reports of him pulling out of a gala in May were \"totally bogus\" and that he had never been signed to attend.The Oscar and Grammy-award winning composer is the latest artist to say they will no longer appear at the national cultural institution over the recent changes.Schwartz told the BBC that at the end of 2024 he was asked by the artistic director of the Washington National Opera to participate in the May event with them.He said that he had agreed, but that he had received little communication since last February and assumed it was no longer taking place.The composer explained that, on Thursday, he was contacted by a reporter saying that the gala was announced on the Kennedy Center schedule and asking if he would be participating.He had been listed on the centre's website as appearing in the gala, but this was removed from the website on Friday afternoon, according to CNN.\"The Kennedy Center was founded to be an apolitical home for free artistic expression for artists of all nationalities and ideologies,\" Schwartz, 77, said.\"It is no longer apolitical, and appearing there has now become an ideological statement. As long as that remains the case, I will not appear there.\"But Mr Grennell hit back: \"The Stephen Schwartz reports are totally bogus. Shame on the woke high school reporters repeating it.\"He was never signed and I've never had a single conversation on him since arriving.\"He himself said last February he hadn't heard anything on it.\"Two musical acts cancelled their appearances at the centre earlier this week.The Cookers, a veteran jazz band, said they cancelled two New Year's Eve shows. The group did not mention Trump or the Kennedy Center in a statement, but said the decision had \"come together very quickly\".Another group, Doug Varone and Dancers, said they would not perform two shows in April because of the name change, adding: \"We can no longer permit ourselves nor ask our audiences to step inside this once great institution.\"Mr Grenell called the cancellations \"a form of derangement syndrome\".Prior to them, jazz percussionist Chuck Redd called off a Christmas Eve gig he had hosted annually since 2006 at the centre over the name change.Mr Grenell called it a \"political stunt\" and threatened to seek $1m (£740,000) in damages.The Kennedy Center's board, which Trump filled with allies, voted to rename the institution the Donald J Trump and the John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts in December. New signage appeared on the building's exterior the following day.Some US lawmakers and legal scholars have argued that, because the centre was named in a 1964 law, Congress must have a say on any name change.Some members of President John F Kennedy's family have denounced the move. The centre was named in Kennedy's memory shortly after his assassination.Joe Kennedy III, a former US House of Representatives member and grandnephew of the late president, said the venue was \"a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law\".\"It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says,\" he added.",

    "body": "Donald Trump's warning that the US will intervene if peaceful protesters are killed was \"reckless and dangerous\", Iran's foreign minister has said.Abbas Araghchi's comments came after the US president said Washington \"will come to their rescue\" in reference to demonstrators taking part in protests over Iran's economy, writing in a brief social media post: \"We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"Araghchi indicated Iran's armed forces were on standby and \"know exactly where to aim\" in the event of an attack.At least eight people are reported to have died during the week-long protests, as of Saturday morning.Trump wrote on Friday: \"If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"The US president did not specify what action Washington might take. Previously, it has carried out strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, which elicited a retaliatory strike on a US base in Qatar.\"Given President Trump's deployment of the National Guard within US borders, he of all people should know that criminal attacks on public property cannot be tolerated,\" Araghchi wrote on X.Iran would \"forcefully reject any interference in their internal affairs\", he added.On Saturday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei addressed the wave of protests, saying that \"rioters must be put in their place\". He said shopkeepers' original protest about the collapse in foreign exchange rates was \"legitimate\", but he claimed people \"provoked by the enemy\" were taking advantage to shout anti-government slogans.Protests have spread to a number of cities and towns with running battles reported between security forces and demonstrators. On Saturday the state-affiliated Mehr and Fars news agencies reported that two protesters and a member of the security forces were killed in the western town of Malekshahi when, they said, protesters tried to enter a police station.The EU said it was \"concerned\" by reports of deaths and called for Tehran to exercise \"maximum restraint\" against the protesters as well as upholding their right to \"freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly\".The protests began in Tehran, with shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and the protests had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.Two people have since died in clashes between protesters and security forces in the south-western city of Lordegan, according to the semi-official Fars news agency and the human rights group Hengaw, which said they were protesters, naming them as Ahmad Jalil and Sajjad Valamanesh.Three people were killed in Azna, while another died in Kouhdasht, all in the west of the country, Fars reported. It did not specify whether they were demonstrators or security forces personnel.One death was reported in Fuladshahr, central Iran, and another casualty in Marvdasht, in the south.BBC has not been able to independently verify the deaths.The demonstrations have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly, but they have not been on the same scale.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has previously said he will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.

    "body": "'A long road ahead': Venezuelans react to Maduro's arrest with hope and worry13 hours agoGrace Eliza Goodwin,Cristobal VasquezandTom Bateman,US State Department correspondentReutersAs the dust settles in Caracas, Venezuelans are reacting to the news of President Nicolás Maduro's capture by the US with hope, fear, and uncertainty. People began to emerge in the streets Saturday after a night rocked by explosions in the Caracas Valley, with moods that ranged from celebration to condemnation.  Dina, a local resident, told the BBC that for now, she was grateful to the US for \"taking Maduro out of here\" because she \"at least can see some light at the end of the tunnel again\". But the political climate remains tense, part of why she did not give the BBC her real name. Jorge, another Venezuelan who lives near Caracas, told the BBC that while he's grateful to be \"well-supported by Trump and the entire United States\", he fears the coming days will not be easy. \"Now that they are taking this man away, what's going to happen?\" he said. \"It doesn't guarantee us anything. So there is a bit of uncertainty. We don't know what the coming days will bring.\"Supporters of Maduro's government have also been rallying in the streets of Caracas, demanding the US release their leader. Caracas Mayor Carmen Meléndez, a firm government loyalist, joined in the rally to protest against what she called Maduro's \"kidnapping\". Early on Saturday, US forces under President Donald Trump carried out a series of targeted attacks in Venezuela's capital, ultimately taking the country's leader into US custody. The US accuses Maduro of running a \"narco-terrorist\" regime, a claim he denies. He is widely seen by opponents within his country as well as by foreign governments as having illegitimately won Venezuela's 2024 election. Maduro - who leads the United Socialist Party and has been in power since 2013 - has frequently been accused of repressing opposition groups and silencing dissent in Venezuela, at times with the use of violence.As Maduro and his wife are taken to New York City to face drug trafficking and weapons charges, the future of Venezuela remains unclear. Trump has said the US will run the country - and manage its oil reserves - until a permanent replacement for Maduro can be established. Maduro has previously rejected US claims he has direct involvement in drug trafficking.But even for those who are grateful to see Maduro gone, there's still a lot of fear and uncertainty, several Venezuelans told the BBC.Dina isn't putting much faith in Trump. \"He says something now and tomorrow he changes his mind,\" Dina said. \"I mean, I'm not used to taking his words seriously.\"The \"only thing that was good\" about what Trump has said since Maduro's capture, Dina said, was that the US will be investing in Venezuela, which she hopes will lead to \"a better economic situation\" for the struggling country. Venezuela VP: Maduro is 'the only president'The danger of speaking out against Maduro is still very real within Venezuela, as the National Assembly - which is dominated by Maduro loyalists - passed a law a few weeks ago declaring anyone who expresses support for US naval blockades a \"traitor\".Jorge said he saw motorcyclists from colectivos - pro-government paramilitary groups in Venezuela - roaming the streets with weapons on Friday. \"It makes you a bit afraid to even go out to buy bread right now,\" he said. \"We'll have to wait for the best and have patience.\"Jorge added that he was worried about the influence of Maduro's ally, Diosdado Cabello, Venezuela's Minister of Interior, Justice and Peace.\"He is a very bad person, very spiteful,\" Jorge said. \"I don't know how many people he has on his side. Hopefully, the army stands with the people and he loses some control.\"Sandra echoed Jorge and Dina's relief at Maduro's ousting. But, she too is sceptical about the future and what it means for Venezuelans in exile. Close to eight million Venezuelans have left Venezuela since Maduro came to power - and many of them have been openly celebrating Maduro's capture in the streets of the cities where they have settled.In addition to the millions in exile, others are \"missing, imprisoned, dead, or merely surviving\" - which is \"a true tragedy that had not been addressed by any country\", Sandra said. \"This is only the beginning. We know there is still a long road ahead,\" Sandra added. \"No country had previously heard the cry of Venezuelans in the face of this tragedy\". Additional reporting by Kristina Volk",

    "body": "9 hours agoTom McArthurandLaurence PeterEPA/ShutterstockRoyal Air Force Typhoon jets have joined French aircraft in a joint strike on an underground arms cache in Syria used by the Islamic State group (IS), the UK Ministry of Defence says.\"Careful\" intelligence analysis led officials to believe the facility was storing arms and explosives, the statement said, and was in mountains just north of Palmyra, an ancient site in central Syria.\"Our aircraft used Paveway IV guided bombs to target a number of access tunnels down to the facility... initial indications are that the target was engaged successfully,\" the MoD said.There was no sign of any harm to civilians in the strike late on Saturday and all the aircraft returned safely, the MoD added.Detailed assessment of the strikes is under way but officials believe \"the target was engaged successfully\".The Typhoon FGR4s were supported by a Voyager refuelling tanker.  IS imposed jihadist rule over parts of Syria and Iraq until 2019.\"This action shows our UK leadership, and determination to stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies, to stamp out any resurgence of Daesh and their dangerous and violent ideologies in the Middle East,\" UK Defence Secretary John Healey said.EPA/ShutterstockThe MoD said no civilians were harmed in the strikesRAF aircraft have carried out patrols over Syria to \"prevent any attempted resurgence\" of IS following its defeat at the battle of Baghuz in 2019, the ministry said.\"I want to thank all the members of our armed forces involved in this operation for their professionalism and their courage,\" Healey said.\"They were among thousands of British personnel deployed over Christmas and New Year. This operation, to eliminate dangerous terrorists who threaten our way of life, shows how our armed forces are ready to step up, all year round, keeping Britain secure at home and strong abroad.\" The RAF has been using aerial drones and manned aircraft to strike IS fighters and targets as part of the international coalition since 2014. The United Nations says IS still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.In November, Syria - under the leadership of new President Ahmed al-Sharaa - became the 90th country to join a US-led coalition to combat the group.The coalition, officials say, is aimed at eliminating remaining elements of the so-called Islamic State and stemming the flow of foreign militants to the Middle East.Last month, the US military carried out what it called a \"massive strike\" against IS targets in Syria, following an ambush that killed two American soldiers and a civilian interpreter in Palmyra.",

    "body": "'Deeply shocked': World leaders react to US attack on Venezuela 10 hours agoClaire KeenanTrump on Venezuela: \"We are going to run the country\"Leaders around the world have responded with a mix of condemnation and support to the US capture of Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro. Following a large-scale strike on Venezuela on Saturday, Maduro and his wife were captured by US forces and removed from the country. The pair have been indicted on drug charges in New York. In an initial response, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his government would \"shed no tears\" for the end of Maduro's regime.Neighbouring Latin American countries condemned the actions, as did Venezuela's long-term allies, Russia and China. China said it was \"deeply shocked and strongly condemns\" the use of force against a sovereign country and its president. Russia accused the US of committing \"an act of armed aggression\".Iran, which is locked in its own dispute with Trump over his promise of intervention in its country, called the strikes a \"flagrant violation of the country's national sovereignty\".Trump said the US will \"run\" Venezuela \"until we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition\". Many Latin American leaders condemned the US actions. Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva wrote on X that the actions \"cross an unacceptable line\", adding that \"attacking countries in flagrant violation of international law is the first step toward a world of violence, chaos, and instability\". Colombian President Gustavo Petro called the strikes an \"assault on the sovereignty\" of Latin America, while Chile's President Gabriel Boric expressed \"concern and condemnation\" and called for \"a peaceful solution to the serious crisis affecting the country\".Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Cane accused the US of a \"criminal attack\", while Uruguay said in an official statement that it was monitoring developments \"with attention and serious concern\" and \"rejects, as it always has, military intervention\".Trump has indicated that Cuba could become part of a broader US policy in the region, calling it a failing nation. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Cuba was a disaster run by incompetent leaders who supported Maduro's administration and that the government in Havana should be concerned.The Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello urged citizens to remain calm and to trust the country's leadership and military, saying \"the world needs to speak out about this attack\" according to news agency Reuters. But Argentinian President Javier Milei – who Trump has described as his \"favourite president\" – wrote \"freedom moves forward\" and \"long live freedom\" on social media.Getty ImagesGovernment supporters hold posters of the late Hugo Chávez (left) and Venezuela's President Nicolás MaduroMeanwhile, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer refused to be drawn into whether or not the military action may have broken international law.He did not condemn the US strikes in an interview with the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme on Saturday morningHe said he was waiting to establish all the facts but would not \"shy away from this\", adding he was a \"lifelong advocate of international law\".The UK was not involved in the strikes and Sir Keir said he had not spoken to Trump about the operation.Later on Saturday, he posted on X that the UK \"regarded Maduro as an illegitimate president and we shed no tears about the end of his regime\".\"The UK government will discuss the evolving situation with US counterparts in the days ahead as we seek a safe and peaceful transition to a legitimate government that reflects the will of the Venezuelan people,\" he added.The EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas reiterated the bloc's position that Maduro lacks legitimacy, that there should be a peaceful transition of power, and that the principles of international law must be respected.French President Emmanuel Macron said the transition of power \"must be peaceful, democratic, and respectful of the will of the Venezuelan people\" in a post on X.He added he hoped González - the opposition's 2024 presidential candidate - could ensure the transition.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the legality of the US operation was \"complex\" and international law in general must apply. He warned that \"political instability must not be allowed to arise in Venezuela\".UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was \"deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected\", his spokesperson said. He was \"deeply alarmed\" by the strikes, which set a \"dangerous precedent\". In the US, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said: \"Let me be clear, Maduro is an illegitimate dictator, but launching military action without congressional authorisation, without a federal plan for what comes next, is reckless.\"Elsewhere, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, a staunch US ally, congratulated Trump on his \"bold and historic leadership on behalf of freedom and justice\". Canada's Foreign Minister Anita Anand said \"Canada calls on all parties to respect international law and we stand by the people of Venezuela and their desire to live in a peaceful and democratic society\". Canada was engaging with international partners, she said. Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said \"international law is universal and binding for all states. \"The American intervention in Venezuela is not in accordance with international law.\" More on this story",

    "body": "17 hours agoRedNote / @I am a pie (826101674)Grace Tsoi,BBC World Service, Hong KongandGemini Cheng,BBC News Chinese, Hong KongStella Huang bought her first Jellycat plush toy when she lost her job during the pandemic.A school friend was a fan of the British-designed toys and told her all about them. But she only fell in love with the brand when she saw a gingerbread house plushie on the Chinese social media app RedNote.Christmas is not widely celebrated in China and is more of a commercial event than anything more traditional. \"The festival doesn't mean a lot to me... But I always like the sight of gingerbread houses,\" she says. It was then that she asked her friend in their hometown Guangzhou to buy it for her.That was in 2021, just as Jellycat was about to make it big in China and around the world.\"Everyone felt jittery, and no-one knew what would happen,\" says Stella, who has developed a habit of petting and squeezing her plushies since Covid. She had to spend a lot of time at her home, in Beijing, which had some of the strictest lockdowns in China, if not the world.Now 32, Stella has a new job, as a sales manager in the tourism industry, but is still buying Jellycats. Her collection has grown to 120 toys, costing a total of about 36,000 yuan ($5,145; £3,815).\"At my age, there are many things you can't share with others... and the troubles we face are a lot more complicated than before,\" she says with a sigh. \"The plushies help me regulate my emotions.\"Originally aimed at children, the squishy toys have become a global hit, especially in China where a disenchanted youth has been turning to them for comfort.The kidultsStella's Gingerbread house plushie is an \"Amuseable\", a line of toys with tiny faces modelled on inanimate objects from toilet rolls to boiled eggs. The plushies are the \"breakout products\" which \"appeal to a wide Gen-Z and millennial audience\" around the world, says Kasia Davies of global analysis firm Statista.The popularity of these toys \"may have something to do with wanting to feel companiable\", Isabel Galleymore of the University of Birmingham, in the UK, says.It is difficult to say for sure whether Jellycat started the now-iconic Amuseable line, which was launched in 2018, to tap into the young adult market. But toy manufacturers need to find a new market given the falling birth rate in much of the world, Ms Davies adds.And as early as in 2015, Jellycat entered the Chinese market.Having done the \"groundwork\", the toy maker was able to capture \"the tone of the pandemic\" – when people sought comfort amid heightened uncertainty – and built on its success in China, says Kathryn Read, a business consultant with 15 years' experience in China.Jellycat's popularity was further propelled by its pop-up experiences. The in-store events offer a menu of limited-edition \"food\". Many fans film themselves being served and post the clips on social media.Localisation has also been a core strategy for the Jellycat experience. Fans could buy stuffed toy versions of items like fish, chips and mushy peas at a temporary shop at the department store Selfridges in London.Meanwhile, teapot and teacup plushies were among the items sold at special outlets in Beijing and Shanghai last year.In 2024, the UK-based firm's revenue rose by two-thirds to £333m ($459m), according to its most recent Companies House accounts. In the same period, it sold about $117m worth of toys to Chinese consumers on major e-commerce platforms, according to estimates by Beijing-based Moojing Market Intelligence.The company's growing popularity mirrors a wider boom in China's collectable-toy market among young adults seeking emotional comfort and connection.Overall sales of collectable toys in China are expected to top 110bn yuan this year, according to a 2024 report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the China Animation Association.The runaway success of Labubu, the elf-like dolls created by Chinese toy maker Pop Mart, highlights the country's growing appetite for collectable toys, especially among young people.This \"kidult\" trend is not unique to China, as young adults around the world question \"outdated understandings of adulthood\", says Prof Erica Kanesaka, a cultural expert at Emory University in the US.Global toy sales fell in 2024 - albeit by less than 1% - but collectable toy sales rose by almost 5%, to a record high, according to market research company Circana.CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty ImagesJellycat had pop-up stores in Shanghai and BeijingJellycatIn September, Jellycat partnered with A-list actress Yang Mi during a pop-up event in ShanghaiAmuseables, especially the aubergine, which Chinese fans call \"the boss\", have also spawned memes, with many sharing frustrations about adult life.\"Aubergine boss\" is a hashtag on RedNote, where fans draw different expressions on the plushie. In these memes, the aubergine appears in various moods from drinking to fake-smiling.For example, Wendy Hui from Hong Kong modified her aubergine Amuseable by drawing dark circles around its eyes and putting a pair of glasses on it. She then posted a picture of it on Threads with the caption: \"The mental state of workers on Monday.\"\"I kept working at home even when I was supposed to be off,\" the 30-something marketing professional says. \"I just wanted to express how exhausted I was.\"Jellycat has become an unexpected, light-hearted outlet for young Chinese people to air their grievances about a slowing economy, where hard work doesn't guarantee comparable rewards. Despite heavy censorship, the internet has remained an important, if not the only, space for such conversations.The brand also often launches limited-edition products and retires designs. The strategy, which many in China call \"hunger marketing\", has also helped make Jellycat toys a favourite on social media in the country.Collecting can feel like a treasure hunt, with fans combing department stores and independent shops for Jellycats when they travel overseas. Some resort to \"daigou\", overseas-based shopping agents. And rare Jellycats, a status symbol among some fans, change hands for more than $1,400.But most are cheap pick-me-ups amid a sluggish economy plagued by a property crisis and high local government debt. China's youth unemployment rate has eased a little after hitting a record high in August, but official figures show it is still above 17%.\"You have to consider for a long time before buying a luxury bag,\" 34-year-old medical sales representative Jessie Chen says. \"But you don't need to do that for a Jellycat.\"Jellycat also sells bags, which cost just a few hundred yuan [tens of US dollars]. They are practical and can hold a lot of things, so you might change the way you think about luxury goods.\"'Quitting the pit'But China may have already reached peak Jellycat, with fans noticing less discussion about the toys on social media.Ms Hui has turned to \"blind boxes\" of toys like Teletubbies - where customers only find out what they have bought when they open the package - as a more thrilling, and cheaper, alternative. She has even considered \"quitting the pit\" - Chinese slang for retiring a hobby.\"It is so difficult to buy them,\" Stella says. \"Our daily life is not easy already and why should we make things harder for ourselves?\"",

    "body": "'Somewhere to put worker bees': Why Canada's micro-condos are losing their appeal2 days agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporterWatch: BBC reporter reacts to shockingly small $350K condo in TorontoMaggie Hildebrand's first apartment in Toronto had a kitchen, a dining table, a workspace and a bed – all in the same 300-sq-ft room.It was a decent home at first, close enough to her job downtown and with all the bare necessities for daily living.But it didn't take long for the 28-year-old to feel boxed-in. \"It was so isolating in that tiny space,\" she told the BBC. \"It definitely feels like it's just somewhere to put worker bees during the night.\"Ms Hildebrand lived in one of the city's micro-condos, a once rare sight in Canadian real estate that has become ubiquitous in the last decade thanks to fast-growing, high-rise developments in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver.But - as Canada's condominium market sinks to lows not seen in decades due to a series of market pressures - the value of these micro units is cratering faster than any others.The condo market is experiencing a downturn not seen since the 1980s, with thousands of move-in-ready units sitting empty and unsold across Toronto and its surrounding regions. Over the last year, an unprecedented 18 condo projects were cancelled in the city, with experts expecting that number will grow as demand continues to plummet.The downturn has reignited debate over whether developers catered too much to real estate investors by building smaller, more affordable units that minimised square footage to keep prices low in areas where land values are high, and which were often designed to be rented out or flipped for profit.Investors own the majority of condos under 600 sq ft in Toronto, according to national database Statistics Canada. Construction of these small units skyrocketed in 2016, and they now make up 38% of condos built in the city, compared with only 7.7% before.These units have not exploded in the same way in the US, where they represent a very small share of the market, though Nadia Evangelou, a senior economist at the National Association of Realtors, said \"their prevalence has roughly doubled over the past decade\".With so much inventory on the market in Canada, some micro-condos that had sold for half a million dollars a few years ago are now reselling for C$300,000 ($217,000; £163,000) or less – a price recently unthinkable in downtown Toronto, which is often cited as one of the most unaffordable cities in the world.\"It's a race to the bottom getting these things sold,\" said Shaun Hildebrand, president of Urbanation, an organisation that has been tracking the high-rise market in Toronto for decades. (Shaun Hildebrand is not related to Ms Hildebrand.)Why are so many condos sitting empty?The condo slump is not unique to Toronto, with Vancouver experiencing a similar –albeit smaller – downturn since 2024.There are a few reasons for this, experts tell the BBC.First is an overabundant supply. Thousands of units were  built over the last two years, in part to meet an unprecedented surge in Canada's population driven largely by immigration, Mr Hildebrand said.But the number of newcomers dropped sharply following a shift in Canada's immigration policies, made partly to address the housing crunch. A report released in December by the Bank of Montreal shows that Canada's population saw its largest decline in 2025 on record since the 1940s, barring the 2020 Covid pandemic, driven mainly by new immigration caps.It is a turn-around that developers could not have predicted, and resulted in more than 60,000 new units completed in recent years to meet a demand that no longer exists.Simply put, \"the market just got way too ahead of itself\", Mr Hildebrand said.The second reason is pricing.Canada's central bank lowered interest rates during the pandemic to stimulate the economy, and investors, looking to buy in a real estate market that had seemed like a sure bet for decades, assumed prices could only continue to rise.For a while they did, spiking \"to a level that really made no sense\", Mr Hildebrand said.Then, the Bank of Canada began to increase rates to battle post-pandemic inflation. Combined with oversupply, that sure bet became less certain.Now, some investors are having trouble closing on units they bought pre-construction at those inflated prices. Many have been forced to try and sell them at a significant loss. Others are too spooked to enter the market or are waiting for prices to drop even further, Mr Hildebrand said.There is some speculation that Canada's 2022 freeze on foreign home buyers, brought in to help tackle the housing affordability crisis, also played a role. Numbers show that they represent a small fraction of owners – around 2% to 6% – but Mr Hildebrand said it is possible it has sent a signal that Canada is closed for business.Watch: Maggie Hildebrand shares on TikTok what it's like to live in a micro condoThe condo crash and the housing marketOne clear winner from the downturn of the condo market is renters like Ms Hildebrand, who now have more options due to greater supply and slightly better deals on rent.Ms Hildebrand paid C$2,200 a month for her micro-condo. She has since moved to a larger, 700 square-foot, one-bedroom apartment in an older building with a leafy backyard for only C$200 more. She credits the move to a big improvement in her quality of life.\"My birthday is tomorrow, and I'm having a party and hosting 25 people,\" she told the BBC in December. \"A year ago, that was not possible.\"Mr Hildebrand said the slump will likely change who developers see as their main customer, shifting from short-term investors seeking quick profits towards longer-term investors and people who plan to settle in the condo they're buying,\"We've learned our lesson here,\" he said. The units won't be phased out altogether, he noted, because there is still demand for affordability, \"but we went way too far\".Some buyers are benefiting, too. Alex Cruz, a Toronto-based estate agent at Ari Zadegan Group Realty, told the BBC that smaller units were being purchased by those looking for a bargain.\"If there is a good deal per square foot, people will buy it,\" Mr Cruz said, adding it had given some \"an opportunity to get into the market\".The slump comes as Canada grapples with a housing crisis that has become a central political issue for all levels of government. Prime Minister Mark Carney has promised to double the rate of new homes built in the next decade.With the construction of thousands of units now put on hold or cancelled, there will be fewer units entering the market by the end of the decade. This could exacerbate Canada's housing crunch, Mr Hildebrand said, as condos are heavily relied on to boost supply in big cities.And Mr Hildebrand and others warn that the low prices will be short-lived.\"The question now is how long do we stay here, and what are the implications going to be for the housing supply in the next decade?\" Mr Hildebrand said.",

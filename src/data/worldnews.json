    "body": "3 hours agoKathryn ArmstrongEPA/ShutterstockSaturday's clashes came a week after more than 100 police officers were injured in another protestSix people have been arrested after police clashed with protesters in Milan, one of the host cities of the Winter Olympic Games, during the first day of the competition. Thousands took to the streets in the northern Italian city on Saturday to protest against the Games and a range of issues including the cost of living. Some released fireworks and threw stones at police, who responded with water cannon. It comes after the government tightened protest laws in the wake of a demonstration last weekend in Turin that left more than 100 officers injured, according to government figures. Meanwhile, officials are investigating suspected sabotage on northern Italy's railway network on Saturday. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said those protesting against the Olympics were the \"enemy of Italy\" and had put images of the demonstrations \"on the televisions of half the world\", while thousands of other Italians were working hard to make the competition a success.She said this had happened \"after others locked railway cables to prevent trains from starting\". Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini described those involved in confrontations in Milan as \"criminals\". \"Just days after the shameful violence in Turin, more clashes, more attacks on law enforcement,\" he said. \"We're proud to have pushed for a new security package that will allow for even more effective interventions against thugs and criminals.\"The Turin demonstration, which was called in response to the eviction of an unofficial social centre, started peacefully but later turned violent when armed groups confronted police. More than 30 people were arrested. One officer was attacked with a hammer, which Meloni described as attempted murder. A new security package, which was adopted on Thursday after being fast-tracked as a result of the violence in Turin, allows police to detain suspected troublemakers for up to 12 hours before demonstrations to stop them from spreading unrest. Critics have called it repressive. Most of those involved in Saturday's protest in Milan marched peacefully. One woman, Francesca Missana, told news agency AFP that the Olympic Games were \"no longer sustainable from an environmental or a social point of view, their time is up\".\"These Games were promoted as sustainable and cost-neutral,\" protest organiser Alberto di Monte told AFP. He added that because the Games were spread across multiple sites, and that billions had been spent on roads instead of protecting the mountains.NurPhoto via Getty ImagesSevered cables were discovered near Bologna, which has a major transport hubSaturday also saw chaos on some of Italy's northern rail networks, with suspected attacks delaying people for hours. A fire hit rail infrastructure between Bologna and Venice, and police later found severed cables and an explosive device in locations nearby.Police said a track switch was set alight near Pesaro on the Adriatic coast and electric cables were found severed near Bologna, along with a rudimentary explosive device left by a track.Bologna's central rail station is a major hub, linking cities in the north and south, and east to west lines.RFI, which owns the country's railways, said services have since returned to normal. \"These actions of unprecedented seriousness do not in any way tarnish Italy's image in the world, an image that the Games will make even more compelling,\" Salvini, who is also Italy's transport minister, said on Saturday.The Winter Olympics are taking place until 22 February in a number of locations, from Milan to the resort town of Cortina d'Ampezzo, the Dolomite regions of Predazzo and Tesero, and the Alpine resorts of Livigno and Bormio.",

    "body": "1 day agoRachel Muller-HeyndykReutersA South Korean cryptocurrency exchange accidentally gave away more than $40bn (£32bn) worth of bitcoin to customers, briefly making them multi-millionaires.It had planned to give customers a small cash reward of 2,000 won - $1,37 - but instead gave them 2,000 bitcoins on Friday.The platform, Bithumb, apologised for the error, adding that it quickly had realised its mistake and recovered almost all the missing tokens. It said it had restricted trading and withdrawals for the 695 affected customers within 35 minutes of the glitch.The company said it had recovered 99.7% of the 620,000 bitcoins mistakenly sent. \"We want to make it clear that this matter has nothing to do with external hacking or security breaches, and there is no problem with system security or customer asset management,\" Bithumb said in a statement on Friday. In an emergency meeting on Saturday, South Korea's financial regulator said it would look into the incident. Any sign of illegal activity would prompt formal investigations, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS).Bithumb vowed to co-operate with regulators. \"[We] will take this accident as a lesson and prioritise 'customer trust and peace of mind' rather than external growth,\" CEO Lee Jae-won said. The company plans to  pay 20,000 won ($13,66) in compensation to all customers who were using the platform at the time, and will waive trading fees, among other measures.Bithumb said it would improve verification systems and introduce AI to detect abnormal transactions.The incident is likely to spark discussion around tighter regulatory controls in finance. In April 2024 Citigroup, a US bank, mistakenly credited $81 trillion, instead of $280, to a customer's account. Two employees failed to spot the error before it was processed, but the bank reversed the transaction within hours after a third employee caught the mistake, the Financial Times reported.",

    "body": "13 hours agoChris GrahamReutersSussan Ley said it was time to look to the futureAustralia's Liberal-National Coalition, the country's main opposition, reunited on Sunday, more than two weeks after the centre-right partners split in a row over hate speech laws.\"The coalition is back together and looking to the future, not to the past,\" Liberal Party leader Sussan Ley said, appearing alongside National Party leader David Littleproud in Canberra.The coalition split on 22 January after the Nationals refused to back reforms introduced by the government after two gunmen killed 15 people at a Jewish festival at Bondi Beach in December, citing free speech concerns.\"It's been disappointing, we've got to where we are but it was over a substantive issue,\" Littleproud said.The coalition suffered a heavy election loss last year and the split last month was the second in less than 12 months.  Last year's separation in May - largely over climate and energy policy - was resolved within a week.This time the divisions were sown by hate speech reforms introduced by the centre-left Labor government after the Bondi Beach attack.While the Liberals sided with the government, their National colleagues abstained from the vote in the lower house and voted against the measure in the Senate, saying the measures had been rushed and posed a threat to free speech.The legislation includes provisions that will ban groups deemed to spread hate and introduce tougher penalties for preachers who advocate violence.Ley said the coalition had a responsibility to find a way back into government.\"I acknowledge this has been a difficult time. It has been a difficult time for millions of our coalition supporters and many other Australians who rely on our two great parties to provide scrutiny and leadership,\" she said.The Liberal leader said both parties had struck an agreement that neither party could overturn decisions taken by the coalition's joint \"shadow cabinet\".Dating back to the 1940s, the coalition had not split since 1987 before the brief separation last year. The National Party mainly represents regional communities and often leans more conservative than the Liberals.The coalition is facing pressure from populist Senator Pauline Hanson's anti-immigration One Nation party, which has surged in polling, while the Liberal Party lost a swathe of seats at last year's federal election.",

    "body": "2 days agoMax MatzaCBSThe co-owner of a Colorado funeral home where nearly 200 decaying bodies were found has been sentenced to 40 years in prison for corpse abuse.Before Jon Hallford was sentenced, he apologised in court and listened to family members describe having nightmares about their loved ones decomposing in his care. They called him a \"monster\" who should rot in jail.His ex-wife and co-owner Carie Hallford has pleaded guilty to similar charges and is awaiting sentencing.The Return to Nature home, in the town of Penrose, Colorado, had given fake ashes to grieving relatives instead of their loved-ones' remains. Prosecutors said 189 bodies were improperly stored in the building over four years.The courthouse was packed with family members on Friday, who asked the judge to impose the maximum 50-year sentence.\"I'm a daughter whose mother was treated like yesterday's trash and dumped in a site left to rot with hundreds of others,\" Kelly Mackeen told the court.\"I'm heartbroken, and I ask God every day for grace.\"The bodies were found in piles inside non-refrigerated areas of the funeral home. Victims included children and foetuses.\"It is my personal belief that every one of us, every human being, is basically good at the core,\" Judge Eric Bentley said.\"But we live in a world that tests that belief every day, and Mr Hallford, your crimes are testing that belief.\" Hallford, who had pleaded guilty in the hopes of a reduced sentence, apologised for his actions ahead of sentencing.\"I had so many chances to put a stop to everything and walk away, but I did not,\" he said. \"My mistakes will echo for a generation. Everything I did was wrong.\"Prosecutors say the couple was driven by \"greed\", and were earning enough money from the business to properly care for the bodies.Located about 30 miles (48km) south of Colorado Springs, the funeral home specialised in burials where no chemicals, including embalming fluid, were used and where remains were buried in a biodegradable casket.The business came under investigation after reports of a foul odour coming from the property. Officials discovered 115 bodies there early last October.Jon Hallford was accused by officials of attempting to conceal the \"improper storage of human remains\".Green funerals are allowed in the state but remains must be buried within 24 hours or be properly refrigerated.Funeral home operators in Colorado are currently not required to be licensed, have a degree in mortuary science or even graduate high school.Tougher legislation has been passed since the scandal erupted.",

    "body": "15 hours agoChris GrahamGetty ImagesWill Lewis stepped down days after overseeing mass lay-offs at the US newspaperThe chief executive of the Washington Post is stepping down, the newspaper has announced, days after overseeing mass lay-offs.William Lewis said in a message to staff that it was the right time to leave and that \"difficult decisions\" had been made to ensure the paper's future.The newspaper had announced on Wednesday that it was cutting a third of its workforce, dramatically scaling back its coverage of sport and international news. The decision was condemned by many journalists and prompted criticism of the Post's billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos. Executive editor Matt Murray said the cuts would bring \"stability\".Jeff D'Onofrio, who joined as the newspaper's chief financial officer last year, will serve as acting publisher and CEO, the Post said as it announced Lewis's departure.A former Dow Jones chief executive and publisher of the Wall Street Journal, Lewis was appointed to the role at the Washington Post in 2023.He has faced criticism from subscribers and employees as he tried to reverse financial losses at the daily.Hundreds protested in front of the paper's headquarters in Washington DC on Thursday after the mass lay-offs, which included the paper's entire Middle East staff and its Kyiv-based Ukraine correspondent.Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor until 2021, said the cuts ranked \"among the darkest days in the history of one of the world's greatest news organisations\".The departure of Lewis marks the latest upheaval for the leading US newspaper, which has seen a series of staff cuts and controversial editorial decisions in recent years.ReutersJeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, acquired the Washington Post in 2013The newspaper had endorsed a candidate in most presidential elections since the 1970s - all of whom had been Democrats. The move caused widespread criticism and led to the loss of tens of thousands of subscribers. Meanwhile, the opinion editor resigned in February last year when Bezos decided to focus the paper's comment section on \"personal liberties and free markets\". Bezos, who acquired the newspaper in 2013, said pieces opposing those views would not be published.",

    "body": "22 hours agoHenri AstierAFP via Getty ImagesFinancial crime prosecutors in France say they have opened a preliminary inquiry into former Culture Minister Jack Lang over his links to Jeffrey Epstein.Lang, a major figure in French socialist governments between the 1980s and 2000s, is being investigated for suspected \"laundering of tax fraud proceeds\". It follows the US Department of Justice's release of the Epstein files, which have documented links between the Lang family and the late American sex offender.Lang, now 86, denies wrongdoing and on Saturday described the allegations against him as \"baseless\". He told AFP the investigation \"will bring much light on to the accusations that are questioning my probity and my honour\".Hours after the investigation was announced, Lang offered to resign as head of the Arab World Institute, a body that promotes cooperation and exchanges between France and Arab nations.In a letter to Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, seen by AFP, Lang said he would submit his resignation at the next board meeting. Barrot, who had summoned Lang for talks on Sunday, said he had acknowledged the resignation offer and planned to start the process of looking for a successor. Lang's daughter Caroline, 64, is also being investigated in the case. Earlier this week she stepped down as head of a French film producers' union.On Tuesday, he told broadcaster BFMTV he had known nothing about Epstein's crimes when he met him \"some 15 years ago\". The US financier was convicted in Florida in 2008 of soliciting a minor for prostitution.Lang - who served as culture minister between 1981 and 1993 and later as minister of education - says he was introduced to Epstein by US actor-director Woody Allen.He said he had found Epstein \"passionate about art, culture and cinema\".In a separate interview on Tuesday, he told RTL radio that Epstein had been \"generous\" and \"courteous\", adding: \"When I meet people I don't ask to see their criminal record.\"Details from the files revealed by French media suggest Lang appealed to Epstein for funds or favours on several occasions - including the use of Epstein's car and private plane for himself and his family.Caroline Lang told French news website Mediapart that she met Epstein in 2012, when he told her he wanted to \"invest in young French and international artists\".She said his lawyers had set up a company, Prytanee LLC, based in the US Virgin Islands. Mediapart said Caroline Lang had received half of the shares, but she said she had not invested in it or received any funds from it.An email in the Epstein files suggested she contributed her art knowledge, Mediapart reports. She told the website she had been \"incredibly naive\".Resigning from her post in the Independent Production Union, she said: \"I do not want this situation to in any way harm the union.\"The files do not suggest either Lang or his daughter were implicated in Epstein's sexual crimes.Epstein died in prison in New York in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.AFP via Getty ImagesLang (right) made his name in the 1980s, under the presidency of François Mitterrand (left)",

    "body": "Russia names three suspects over shooting of general4 hours agoKathryn ArmstrongReutersFriday's shooting took place at a residential block of flats in the north-western outskirts of MoscowRussia says it has identified three suspects involved in the shooting of high-profile military general Lt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev. They include the man said to have carried out the attack, who has been named as Ukrainian-born Russian citizen Lyubomir Korba. Russia's Investigations Committee (SK) said Korba arrived in the capital, Moscow, in late December \"on assignment from Ukrainian intelligence services to commit a terrorist attack\". Kyiv has reportedly denied involvement.Alexeyev, 64, was taken to hospital after the attack in a residential block of flats in the north-western outskirts of Moscow on Friday. He has since regained consciousness after surgery, according to Russian media reports.Alexeyev is number two in the main directorate of Russia's GRU military intelligence and the latest high-ranking military figure to have been targeted in or near Moscow since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Spokeswoman Svetlana Petrenko said on Sunday that his attacker had fired three shots before fleeing and that Korba travelled to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) hours after the shooting. He has since been arrested and extradited. Russian state TV channel Ru-24 aired footage showing security agents escorting Korba off a plane at an unknown location.\"Investigators conducted a thorough inspection at the scene, during which they discovered the murder weapon—a Makarov pistol with a silencer and three rounds of ammunition,\" Petrenko added. Forensic tests are being carried out on the gun. Russian media, quoting Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, reported that President Vladimir Putin had thanked UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on Saturday for his country's help in catching Korba.Russian Defence MinistryLt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev is number two in the main directorate of Russia's GRU military intelligenceQuoted by Reuters, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said on Friday that Kyiv had nothing to do with the shooting, suggesting that it was an internal Russian affair. His Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov accused Kyiv of carrying out the attack as a way to disrupt negotiations over how to end the war between the two countries, which began in February 2022. Alexeyev's boss, GRU head Adm Igor Kostyukov, has been leading the Russian delegation at recent trilateral talks with Ukraine and the US in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE. Korba is alleged to have had at least one accomplice. A man named by the SK as Viktor Vasin has been arrested by the authorities in Moscow and charged.A woman named as Zinaida Serebritskaya, who has since left for Ukraine, is also thought to be involved but Petrenko did not elaborate on how. Ukraine has claimed some attacks on Russian military figures in the past. Russian intelligence officials claimed they had thwarted an attempted attack on a Russian soldier in St Petersburg at the end of last month.An Uzbek man was jailed in January for the 2024 killing of another general, Igor Kirillov, in an explosion outside a block of flats in Moscow. Sources in Ukraine's SBU intelligence said at the time it was behind the attack.Lt Gen Kirillov had been in charge of Russia's Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection troops.In December 2025, another high-ranking officer in the GRU, Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, was killed when an explosive device detonated under a car in Moscow. He was in charge of the armed force's operational training department, according to Russia's SK.",

    "body": "41 minutes agoKayla EpsteinGetty ImagesThe lead singer and songwriter of US band 3 Doors Down, Brad Arnold, has died after a battle with cancer aged 47, the rock band announced on X.\"He will be deeply missed and forever remembered,\" the band said in a statement on Saturday. The band is best known for 2000s rock hits like Kryptonite, Here Without You, When I'm Gone, and Loser.Arnold had announced in May 2025 that he was ill and had received a diagnosis of stage four clear cell renal carcinoma - a type of kidney cancer - which had metastasised into his lung. \"I have no fear, I really sincerely am not scared of it at all,\" the frontman said, adding that he was disappointed that the band would have to cancel an upcoming tour.\"I'd love for you to lift me up in prayer every chance you get,\" he said.In its statement, 3 Doors Down said that, as a founding member, vocalist, and original drummer, \"Brad helped redefine mainstream rock music, blending post-grunge accessibility with emotionally direct song writing and lyrical themes that resonated with everyday listeners\".  The original band was formed in Mississippi in the mid-1990s. Another founding member of the original trio, Matt Roberts, died in 2016 at the age of 38.Arnold wrote Kryptonite, the band's 2000 breakout hit, \"in his math class when he was just 15 years old\", the statement continued.Those closest to Arnold will \"remember not only his talent, but his warmth, humility, faith, and deep love for his family and friends\", it said. He is survived by his wife, Jennifer.The band was regularly heard on rock and pop radio throughout the 2000s and 2010s. They have won three Billboard Music Awards.Their debut album The Better Life was the 18th biggest-selling album of 2000 in the US, according to Billboard.Arnold had spoken openly about hit battle with alcoholism and his recovery, having been sober since 2016.\"I used to think it was a way to calm myself prior to a show or to chase loneliness,\" he told Charleston.com in 2023.The band performed for the inauguration of US President George W Bush as well as the first inauguration of President Donald Trump, which received some criticism from fans.Their manager, Angus Vail, defended the decision to perform for the 2017 Trump presidential celebration, telling Vice: \"They are good Mississippi and Alabama boys - they come from conservative families.\"In 2004, 3 Doors Down established a charity, the Better Life Foundation, to create \"positive change in the lives of children in need of food, shelter and medical assistance\". The band hosts a yearly concert to raise funds for the organisation.\"All the money that goes into that [charity] comes from fans, and people, that they give to us,\" Arnold told Antihero magazine in 2021.\"But being able to see what that's done over the years has definitely enriched my life.\"Correction 8 February 2026: An earlier version of this article said The Better Life was the 11th biggest-selling album of the year. This was later updated to say it was the 18th biggest selling album of 2000 in the US, according to Billboard.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent, BangkokandThanyarat Doksone,BangkokThailand election explained as voters head to the pollsVotes are being counted following an early election in Thailand called after several coalition governments collapsed, giving the country three prime ministers in as many years.The election pitted those advocating far-reaching change, the People's Party, against conservatives led by incumbent PM Anutin Charnavirakul, with most polls predicting a close race between the two.When the young reformers won last time, the military-appointed senate barred them from forming a government and the constitutional court dissolved the party. Powerful, unelected forces have repeatedly intervened to block parties challenging Thailand's status quo.Results are expected to become clear around 22:00 local time (15:00 GMT).The People's Party is facing a strong challenge from Anutin, who has built his once small, provincial Bhumjaithai - \"Thai Pride\" party - into the standard-bearer for Thai conservatives.The latest opinion polls and early vote counts suggest no party will win a majority in parliament, with Anutin expected to remain prime minister. With 18% of the vote counted, preliminary tallies suggest an early lead for Anutin's Bhumjaithai, which is projected to win 178 constituency seats to the People's Party's 70.Anutin has played on patriotic sentiment after the two short border wars with Cambodia last year, and promising to defend the status of traditional Thai institutions like the monarchy and military. The third main contender is the Shinawatra family and its Pheu Thai – \"For Thais\" – party. In the past it dominated elections, with well-marketed populist policies. It has promised to create nine new millionaires – in Thai baht – every day through a national prize draw. Both Bhumjaithai and Pheu Thai have offered subsidies and cash handouts to voters.Pheu Thai, however, is expected to lose significant support in this election after its last coalition administration was accused of mishandling the conflict with Cambodia, and its patriarch, former PM Thaksin Shinawatra, was sent to jail. Getty ImagesThais were voting throughout SundayThailand's once dynamic economy has ground to a halt as political instability and the lack of structural changes worry foreign investors. Voters, meanwhile, are concerned about rising costs. \"I want the economy to improve and I don't want big factories to relocate to our neighbouring countries,\" civil servant Phananya Bunthong told the BBC, a reference to Thailand falling behind Vietnam. The People's Party - led by Nattaphong Ruengpanyawut - is certainly promising big changes, from curbing the power of the biggest businesses and military, to streamlining the extensive bureaucracy and modernising the education system.  But in Thailand, even a straight election victory may not be enough.   Two previous incarnations of the People's Party were dissolved by the court, and their leaders banned from politics. They are not the only ones to have been subjected to intervention by the  constitutional court, and other unelected conservative institutions. Five Pheu Thai prime ministers have been dismissed by the court since 2008, and two earlier incarnations of the party have been dissolved. But if the People's Party exceeds the 151 seats it won in 2023, it may prove difficult to bar it from forming a government. This is despite the great unease about its radical agenda in conservative and royalist circles. At that point yet more intervention by the courts or other bodies is expected to weaken or disable it as a political force. But if Anutin and Bhumjaithai can match or exceed the seat total of the reformists, with the conservative establishment behind him he is very likely to remain prime minister. Besides the election, Thais are also voting in a referendum on whether to reform the 2017 constitution, which was drafted under military rule in 2017 - many Thais and critics of the charter believe it gives too much power to unelected forces like the senate, \"handcuffing\" the country's democracy.   \"I want change. I don't want things to be the same,\"  28-year-old Kittitat Daengkongkho told the BBC.  That, in effect, was the choice Thai voters were presented with in this election: sweeping change, or more of the same.",

Authorities believe she was taken against her will. Earlier this week, they said they had yet to identify a person of interest or suspect in the case.They are offering a $50,000 (£36,000) reward for information.Nancy Guthrie was discovered missing when she did not attend a Sunday church service and other members grew concerned.Authorities say that early on Sunday morning, a doorbell camera in her home was disconnected and removed. At about 02:28 local time, the app connected to her pacemaker, an implanted cardiac device, was disconnected from her phone.FBI Special Agent Heith Janke has said the bureau was looking into a potential ransom note sent to several media outlets.ReutersAuthorities said on Friday that they were \"aware of a new message regarding Nancy Guthrie\" and were \"inspecting the information provided in the message for its accuracy\".Janke said the note \"had facts associated with a deadline with a monetary value they were asking for\", NBC News reported.A presenter for a local CBS News affiliate told the BBC that her channel had received the \"message\" but did not detail its contents.According to news website TMZ, which reportedly received one of the letters, the kidnappers were demanding millions of dollars' worth of cryptocurrency, which is popular with criminals and often difficult to trace.BBC NewsThe family has released two previous videos saying they were willing to speak to the potential kidnapper, and asking to provide proof that her mother was alive.In a video on Thursday, Camron Guthrie - the son of the missing woman - confirmed  the family had not had any direct contact with kidnappers.\"We have to know that you have our mum,\" Camron said in the family's latest video message. \"We want to talk to you.\"The FBI did arrest one individual regarding a fake ransom note on Thursday.Family, and law enforcement, have warned that Nancy Guthrie may be at risk without her medication.\"She is without any medicine,\" Savannah Guthrie said in a previous announcement. \"She needs it to survive. She needs it not to suffer.\"Watch: What we still don’t know about the disappearance of Savannah Guthrie’s motherUS President Donald Trump said last week that he had spoken to Guthrie and offered federal law enforcement help.\"I think we're doing very well, meaning we have some clues, I think that are very strong and I think we could have some answers coming up fairly soon,\" he told reporters on Friday.Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said on Thursday that investigators were no closer to finding out who was responsible - but that they were working on the assumption she was still alive.\"Right now, we believe Nancy is still out there. We want her home,\" he said. \"Everybody's still a suspect in our eyes.\"Savannah Guthrie, 54, is a US broadcast journalist who has served as the co-anchor of NBC News' Today since 2012. She is also the network's chief legal correspondent and a primary anchor for its election coverage. Previously, she was NBC News' White House correspondent.",

    "body": "Man named in South Africa's police corruption probe found dead5 hours agoDamian ZaneGetty ImagesA South African man named in a major police corruption probe has died after reportedly shooting himself at a petrol station.Police are now investigating the death of Wiandre Pretorius, 41, who last week said he had survived an assassination attempt.Pretorius's name had been mentioned at the ongoing corruption inquiry, known as the Madlanga Commission. This was in connection with the 2022 murder of a witness, Emmanuel Mbense, allegedly at the hands of police officers.Four of the 12 people named as persons of interest in that killing are now dead themselves, a police spokesperson said.At 22:00 local time (20:00 GMT) on Saturday the police received reports that a man had taken his own life at a petrol station in Brakpan, east of Johannesburg. At the scene, officers found Pretorius's body with a firearm next to it, spokesperson Brig Athlenda Mathe said.The police are now looking at CCTV footage to confirm what happened. There had been reports that Pretorius had been involved in a row with his fiancée at the petrol station before taking his own life.The murder four years ago of Mbense is one of several issues that has come up at the Madlanga Commission, which was set up by President Cyril Ramaphosa after a senior police officer alleged that organised crime groups had infiltrated the government.At a hearing last year, a man, only identified at the time as Witness D, said that in 2022 he had been ordered to get rid of the body of someone accused of robbery who had allegedly been tortured and killed by police officers.Witness D also alleged that Pretorius, who was not a policeman but had previously served as a police reservist, was involved.The witness, later named as Marius van der Merwe, was shot death three weeks after testifying.Police spokesperson Mathe said on Sunday that Pretorius had been questioned and his firearms confiscated in connection with Van der Merwe's killing.Mathe added that the death of Pretorius on Saturday night leaves only eight of the original 12 persons of interest in the killing of Mbense still alive.Three were killed \"execution style\" – one in 2023 and two last year.\"The question is: are we dealing with a syndicate that is eliminating each other in relation to the Emmanel Mbense murder? That is what our detectives are probing,\" Mathe told reporters.Last week, police began investigating whether Pretorius himself had been the target of an assassination attempt after he said that his vehicle had been shot at.In connection with the murder of Mbense, Mathe said that \"arrests are imminent\" following an investigation by the independent police watchdog body.More about South Africa from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "2 hours agoShaimaa Khalil,Tokyo correspondentandJosh CheethamReutersSanae Takaichi's coalition is projected to win as many as 366 seats out of a total of 465Japan's ruling party, led by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, is set to seal a decisive win in Sunday's snap election, exit polls suggest.The country's first female prime minister is seeking a clear public mandate just four months after becoming Liberal Democrat Party (LDP) leader.Her predicted success is in marked contrast to her two predecessors, under whom the party lost its parliamentary majority because of corruption scandals and rising costs.An LDP-led coalition has governed Japan for much of its post-war history due to the lack of a strong opposition.Watch: Tokyo residents head to the polls amid rare city snowfallTakaichi has pledged to step down if her party fails to secure a majority, and some have called the snap election a big gamble.In 2024 the LDP lost its majority in both houses of parliament, and its decades-old coalition with the Komeito party collapsed.But Takaichi's personal popularity appears to have helped the party, with approval ratings for her government mostly hovering above 70%.The LDP and its current coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party, could secure as many as 366 of the 465 seats in the House of Representatives, according to a poll by broadcaster NHK.People across Japan braved snow to vote in the country's first mid-winter poll in 36 years.Chika Nakayama/BBCRumi and Daniel Hayama with their son  Japan's transport ministry said 37 train lines and 58 ferry routes were closed and 54 flights cancelled as of Sunday morning. There was rare snowfall in Tokyo as people headed out to vote.\"People want their lives to be better and more comfortable because we are so accustomed to not having inflation [costs rising]... so people are very worried. I think we need a long-term solution rather than short-term fixes,\" Ritsuko Ninomiya, a voter in Tokyo told the BBC. Takaichi's enthusiasm, populist spending promises and nationalist rhetoric appear to have energised voters.Her social media presence has also cultivated new followers, particularly among young voters. She regularly shares clips of her daily life and political activities, and a video of her playing the drums with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung is one of many clips that have gone viral.\"I think this election is more important for the younger generation, people like us,\" Daniel Hayama said, adding that the cold weather was not a hurdle for young people who want to vote.Getty ImagesTakaichi and the LDP faced a more unified opposition than before. LDP's former coalition partner Komeito has joined forces with the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan to form the largest opposition bloc in the lower house.Takaichi has pushed to toughen the immigration system, review rules around foreign ownership of Japanese land, and tackle any non-payments of tax and health insurance by foreign nationals.But in a country where only 3% of the population are foreign nationals, critics have accused her of creating anxiety and division.Critics, including businesses, are sceptical that her pledge to spend more and cut taxes can revive the sluggish Japanese economy. The country's government debt is already one of the highest among developed nations.Relations with China - Japan's largest trading partner - have been strained as well, after Takaichi suggested last November that Japan could intervene militarily if China invaded Taiwan.Takaichi has courted Donald Trump, who has publicly endorsed her - an unusual move by a US president - and they both seem to agree that Japan should spend more on defence. That relationship too was on voters' minds as they headed to the polls on Sunday.\"I am concerned with what President Trump is doing as well as the national defence issues. I am not sure where the money is coming from to cover that. So balancing budget spending between defence and people's life is a major concern for me,\" Yuko Sakai says.Additional reporting by Kelly Ng and Chika Nakayama.",

We confirmed our participation,\" he said.There was no immediate comment from Washington or Moscow, but US President Donald Trump has been pushing for an end for the conflict since he took office again more than a year ago. Meanwhile, Russia has continued its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure - causing further widespread blackouts during freezing conditions.In comments released on Saturday, Zelensky told reporters what had taken place during the second round of US-brokered peace talks in Abu Dhabi, which ended on Friday with no reports of a breakthrough. Zelensky said \"difficult issues remained difficult\", including territorial concessions that Ukraine is under pressure to make.He said the parties discussed, for the first time, the possibility of a trilateral meeting between leaders, not simply representatives, but cautioned \"preparatory elements are needed for this\". Asked whether a time frame had been given for an agreement, the Ukrainian leader replied: \"The Americans say that they want to do everything by June.\" \"Why before this summer?\" he added. \"We understand that their domestic issues in the US will have an impact.\" These issues include the November midterm elections, which could affect the balance of power in the US government.As the diplomacy continues, so too are Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy facilities. \"Russian criminals carried out another massive attack on Ukraine's energy facilities,\" Ukraine's energy minister, Denys Shmyhal, wrote on Telegram. Substations, which control the flow of electricity, and overhead power lines that \"form the backbone of Ukraine's power grid\" were targeted, Shmyhal said. Power plants were also struck.Ukraine's state-owned energy operator, Ukrenergo, said \"the power deficit in the power system of Ukraine significantly increased\" as a result of the latest attacks. Shmyhal said neighbouring Poland had been asked for emergency power supplies.Zelensky wrote on social media that Friday night's attack involved more than 400 drones and 40 missiles. Air-defence systems intercepted most, but not all, of them, the Ukrainian military said.\"The main targets were the energy grid, generation facilities, and distribution substations,\" he said, adding that damage had been reported in at least four regions.In the western region of Lviv, the Dobrotvir power plant came under attack, leaving thousands of people without electricity, according to the regional head, Maksym Kozytskyi. At least 6,000 people were without power as a result of hourly power outage schedules, he added.AFP via Getty ImagesKyiv residents have been sleeping in metro stations to avoid Russian air strikesThe Burshtyn power plant was also struck in the nearby Ivano-Frankivsk region.  DTEK, which runs both the Dobrotvir and Burshtyn plants said it was the tenth \"massive attack\" on its power plants since October 2025.\"In total, DTEK thermal power plants have been attacked by the enemy more than 220 times since the beginning of the full-scale invasion,\" the company added on Telegram. This was launched by Russia nearly four years ago. One person was reported dead in the Rivne region and several were injured in Zaporizhzhia. Rivne's head, Oleksandr Koval, said there was also damage to homes and \"critical infrastructure\".In Kyiv, residents once again took shelter in metro stations. Among them, Oksana Kykhtenko, told the Reuters news agency: \"They [Russians] make us live in inhumane conditions. Without heating, without electricity.\" A drone strike in the city of Yahotyn, about 10km (6.2 miles) away, caused a fire at a warehouse complex, the Ukrainian emergency services said. Ukraine has also attacked Russia, striking a factory that makes missile fuel components in the western Tver region, according to media reports quoting Ukrainian security officials. Further south, in the Saratov region, an oil depot was also hit, Ukraine said. Russia has not commented on any of the latest attacks.  Moscow renewed its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure on Monday after a pause US President Donald Trump had asked Vladimir Putin to observe due to the fierce cold in Ukraine. Trump said the pause lasted for a week until last Sunday but Kyiv disputed the timeline.DTEK said the combined missile and drone strikes caused \"the most powerful blow\" to infrastructure so far this year. \"Moscow must be deprived of the ability to use the cold as leverage against Ukraine,\" Zelensky wrote on X on Saturday, responding to the latest strikes.It is not yet known who was behind the shooting.Some 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Zelensky said earlier this week. The BBC has confirmed the names of almost 160,000 people killed fighting on Russia's side in Ukraine.",

    "body": "2 days agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseWatch: Trump says he 'didn't see' racist clip depicting Obamas as apesUS President Donald Trump has said he \"didn't see\" part of a social media video showing a racist clip depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes.The clip - set to the song The Lion Sleeps Tonight - was at the end of a 62-second video he shared containing claims about voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. The video was later removed.Trump told reporters on Friday that \"I didn't make a mistake\" when asked whether he was going to apologise, adding that he had only seen the start of the video before it was posted by a staff member and didn't know it contained that depiction of the Obamas. Republican Senator Tim Scott - who is black - described it as \"the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House\".The White House initially defended the clip as an \"internet meme video\" and told critics to \"stop the fake outrage\".But after fierce backlash, including from several Republican senators, the post was removed from Trump's Truth Social account and a White House official said that a staffer had \"erroneously\" made the post.The clip - which recalls racist caricatures comparing black people to monkeys - appears to be taken from an X post shared by conservative meme creator Xerias in October. That video also depicts several other high-profile Democrats as animals, including New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Trump's predecessor in the White House, Joe Biden, is also depicted as an ape eating a banana. The Obamas have yet to comment on the video. The video was one of dozens posted to Trump's Truth Social account overnight.\"I look at a lot of thousands of things,\" the president said while aboard Air Force One on Friday, adding that, after watching only part of the video, he \"gave it to the people who, generally, they look at the whole thing\".He said he liked the video's message on voter fraud, but that if his staff had looked at the whole thing, \"probably they would have had the sense to take it down\".\"We took it down as soon as we found out about it,\" he added. Some criticism came from within Trump's own party. Scott, a South Carolina Republican and an ally of Trump, posted that he was \"praying it was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House\", adding: \"The president should remove it.\" Another Republican, New York representative Mike Lawler, called the post \"wrong and incredibly offensive - whether intentional or a mistake\" and said it \"should be deleted immediately with an apology offered\". The criticism continued even after the post was taken down. John Curtis, a Republican senator for Utah, posted on social media that the video was \"blatantly racist and inexcusable\". \"It should never have been posted or left published for so long,\" he wrote. Florida representative Byron Donalds - a longtime supporter of Trump's, who is running for governor - called the White House after the video was posted and was told that it was the work of a staffer who had \"let the president down\", according to CBS, the BBC's US news partner.The BBC has contacted the White House for clarification on how many people have access to the president's account and what the approval process is for posts. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to the BBC earlier in the day that the clip was from \"an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King\". \"Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public,\" she added. Before it was removed, Derrick Johnson, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), called the video \"disgusting and utterly despicable\" and accused Trump of attempting to distract the public from the Epstein case and a \"rapidly failing economy\". Ben Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser for strategic communications in the Obama White House, said: \"Let it haunt Trump and his racist followers that future Americans will embrace the Obamas as beloved figures while studying him as a stain on our country.\" In a short post of his own, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said that \"Donald Trump is a racist\". \"Disgusting behaviour by the president,\" the office of California Governor Gavin Newsom wrote on X. \"Every single Republican must denounce this. Now.\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries - who himself accused Trump of racism last year after he shared an AI-image depicting Jeffries with a moustache and sombrero - responded to the recent video by calling Trump a \"vile, unhinged and malignant bottom feeder\". \"Every single Republican must immediately denounce Donald Trump's disgusting bigotry,\" he added. The clip of the Obamas was added to the end of a minute-long video which included claims about a voting conspiracy in Michigan in the 2020 presidential election. Those claims were debunked as part of Dominion Voting System's successful civil actions against some media companies.Trump also has a long history of criticising and attacking Obama.Before his first term as president, Trump regularly made false claims that the Hawaii-born Obama was actually born in Kenya and therefore was ineligible to be president.He later acknowledged that Obama was born in the US.",

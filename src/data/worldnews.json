    "body": "14 hours agoGeorge WrightGetty ImagesTens of thousands have taken to the streets of Portugal's capital, Lisbon, to protest against proposed labour laws which they say threaten workers' rights.The centre-right government wants to make it easier for employers to fire people,  outsource work to other companies, and limit some types of compassionate leave, including cutting bereavement leave for women who suffer miscarriages.It says the measures are needed to improve job flexibility and increase productivity in one of western Europe's poorest countries.The head of Portugal's largest union, CGTP, called the reforms \"one of the greatest attacks ever made against workers\" in the country and announced a general strike for 11 December.The bill is likely to pass in parliament with support from far-right party Chega.The union told Reuters that around 100,000 protesters filled Lisbon's main avenue, while the Associated Press also reported tens of thousands of people were present. No police estimate was available.Speaking at the protest, Miriam Alves, 31, a worker at a medical device company, told Reuters that reforms are \"clearly a step backward in working conditions and could lead to a complete lack of job security\".Archive technician Madalena Pena, 34, said the government was reversing labour rights \"in an unfair, subtle, and cunning way, without having said anything before the election\" in May.CGTP general secretary Tiago Oliveira announced the strike for next month at the protest.On the proposed changes, he said: \"If implemented, it would be a real setback in the lives of each and every one of us.\"Protesters also wanted higher wages. Official data shows more than 50% of workers earned less than 1,000 euros (£879) per month last year. The minimum wage is only 870 euros (£764).",

    "body": "14 hours agoCBSMaria Florinda Rios Perez was fatally shot after arriving at the wrong home for a house-cleaning appointment US officials are looking into whether to file charges against an Indiana homeowner who shot and killed a house cleaner who mistakenly showed up at the wrong address.Police say they found Maria Florinda Rios Perez dead in her husband's arms on the front porch of a home on Wednesday shortly before 0700 local time (12:00 GMT). Authorities had been responding to a call about a possible home invasion in the Indianapolis suburb of Whitestown. The two did not appear to have entered the home, police said in a statement. They have formally submitted the case to the Boone County Prosecutor's Office for review to determine whether criminal charges will be brought in the case. Police have not identified the people in the home or who fired the shot, saying in a statement on Friday that it is a \"complex, delicate, and evolving case, and it would be both inappropriate and potentially dangerous to disclose that information\". They urged patience, warning of a \"concerning spread of misinformation online\" about the case.Mauricio Velazquez, told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that he wanted justice for his 32-year-old wife. News reports say that she was a mother of four and originally from Guatemala. In an interview with CBS affiliate WTTV, Mr Velazquez said the bullet came right through the door of the home. \"They should've called the police first instead of just shooting out of nowhere like that,\" he said through an interpreter.CBSMauricio Velazquez said the bullet that killed his wife came through the door of the home they went to early on WednesdayBoone County prosecutor Kent Eastwood told The Indianapolis Star that the case is complex due to the language of the state's stand-your-ground law.Stand-your-ground laws are in place in many US states and most permit an individual to protect themselves with the use of reasonable force, including deadly force, to prevent death or great bodily harm.Similar incidents have made headlines across the US in recent years. In 2023, Ralph Yarl, who was then 16, was shot twice after ringing the doorbell of the wrong home in Missouri. Andrew Lester, who was in his 80s, pleaded guilty and died while awaiting sentencing. In New York, 20-year-old Kaylin Gillis died after being shot upon entering the wrong driveway. The homeowner who shot her is now serving a 25-year sentence. ",

    "body": "Syrian President Ahmed Sharaa has arrived in Washington for an official visit, just two days after the US formally revoked his status as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. The former Islamist militant will meet US President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, 11 months after his rebel alliance ousted Bashar al-Assad.Hours before his arrival in the US capital it was announced that Syrian security services had detained dozens of suspected members of the so-called Islamic State group.Joint efforts to tackle what remains of the group in Syria are expected to be high on the agenda during Sharaa's talks with Trump.Syrian authorities said 71 suspected members of the group were arrested, with weapons and explosives also seized.Since taking power, Sharaa has looked to reestablish Syria's presence on the world stage after decades of isolation under the Assad regime and 13 years of civil war.He travelled to the US in September to address the UN General Assembly, where he said Syria was \"reclaiming its rightful place among the nations of the world\" and called on the international community to remove sanctions.Earlier this week the UN Security Council backed a US resolution to lift measures, which coincided with Washington continuing a months-long process of gradually easing sanctions on Syria and its new leaders.On Friday, Sharaa and his interior minister, Anas Hasan Khattab, were removed from a US register of individuals suspected of supporting or funding extremist groups, a decision the Treasury Department said was \"in recognition of the progress demonstrated by the Syrian leadership\".Sharaa had been listed under the name Muhammad al-Jawlani, the alias he used as leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The group was affiliated with al-Qaeda until 2016, when Sharaa severed ties.Prior to leading HTS, Sharaa fought for al-Qaeda in Iraq and was for a time imprisoned by US forces. He was also subject to an American bounty of $10 million.The US lifted its sanctions on HTS earlier this year.Trump previously met Sharaa in May during a visit to Riyadh, where he described him as a \"tough guy, very strong past\".Despite his background, Sharaa has drawn backing from governments that opposed the Assad regime by vowing to lead a moderate government which can win support from Syria's various ethnic groups and factions.Earlier this year, he vowed to root out elements of his security forces which were accused of executing members of Syria's Alawite minority. Deadly violence has also broken out in recent months between Sunni Bedouin tribal fighters and Druze militias, raising questions over whether the HTS-led government can restore stability to a country defined by war for more than a decade.

    "body": "20 hours agoJames Landale,Diplomatic correspondent in Kyiv and Alex KleidermanAt least six people have died after Russia launched hundreds of missile and drone attacks on energy infrastructure and residential targets in Ukraine overnight.A strike on an apartment building in the city of Dnipro killed two people and wounded 12, while three died in Zaporizhzhia. In all, 25 locations across Ukraine, including the capital city Kyiv, were hit, leaving many areas without electricity and heating. Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on Telegram that major energy facilities were damaged in the Poltava, Kharkiv and Kyiv regions, and work was under way to restore power. In Russia, the defence ministry said its forces had shot down 79 Ukrainian drones overnight.The Ukrainian air force said Russia had launched more than 450 exploding bomber drones and 45 missiles. Nine missiles and 406 drones were reportedly shot down.The Ukrainian Energy Ministry said there were power cuts in the Dnipropetrovsk, Chernihiv, Zaporizhzhya, Odesa and Kirovohrad regions, but restoration work was ongoing.Svyrydenko said critical infrastructure facilities have already been reconnected, and water supply is being maintained using generators. Russia argues its attacks on energy targets are aimed at the Ukrainian military.Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure ahead of winter are now a familiar part of this war. But ministers in Kyiv are acutely concerned that Moscow is not just trying to damage the morale of Ukraine's people but also bring its economy to a standstill by collapsing its energy network. Analysts say this fourth winter of Russia's full scale invasion will prove a significant test of Ukraine's defensive resilience.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the attacks showed there must be \"no exceptions\" to Western sanctions on Russian energy as a way of putting pressure on Moscow. The missile strikes came only hours after the US gave Hungary a one-year exemption from restrictions on buying oil and gas from Russia. In October, the US effectively blacklisted two of Russia's largest oil companies, threatening sanctions on those who buy from them. But on Friday, during a visit to Washington by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban - a close personal and political ally of Donald Trump - the US president  announced the exemption for Budapest.In a message on Telegram, Zelensky said the overnight attacks showed that \"pressure must be intensified\" on Russia.He said \"for every Moscow strike on energy infrastructure - aimed at harming ordinary people before winter - there must be a sanctions response targeting all Russian energy, with no exceptions\".He said Ukraine expected \"relevant decisions from the US, Europe and the G7\".Debates about sanctions can sometimes seem technical or diplomatic. But for people in Ukraine, they are very real. If Russia can sell its oil to Hungary, it can use the money earned to build more drones and missiles, like those it launched against Ukraine on Friday night.",

    "body": "Serbia's parliament has passed a law which paves the way for a controversial property development led by US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner in the capital Belgrade.His firm Affinity Partners has sought to build a luxury hotel and apartment complex on the site of the former Yugoslav Army headquarters.The ruined building, which was bombed by Nato forces in 1999 during its intervention to stop Serbia's military campaign in Kosovo, has symbolic value to some who view it as a memorial and symbol of ongoing opposition to the military alliance.Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic, who has pursued close ties with Trump, backed the plans despite protests and legal challenges.Last year, the Serbian government stripped the building of its protected status and agreed a 99-year lease with Kushner's firm, which had set out plans for a $500m (£379.9m) development. The decision triggered demonstrations and led to an investigation into whether a Serbian official had forged documentation used during the process to change the building's status.In a conversation with the BBC in June, Vucic defended the proposal, saying \"it's important to overcome the burden from 1999\". He continued: \"We are ready to build better relations with the US – I think that is terribly important for this country.\"The stalled planning process came to a head on Friday when Vucic's party - which has a majority in parliament - pushed ahead with a special vote on clearing the site and won.Opposition politicians have labelled the decision unconstitutional, including Aleksandar Jovanovic, who described it as a crime, and told the AFP news agency that the landmark would be replaced with \"casinos and Jacuzzis\". Meanwhile, centre-left MP Marinika Tepicċ said the government was sacrificing the country's history \"to please Trump\", Politico reported.The passage of the law has also been criticised by architectural experts, and comes after Transparency Serbia, an anti-corruption organisation, raised concerns about state-backed developments. According to Serbian media reports pre-dating his first presidential run, Trump has previously considered building a hotel in Belgrade.Last March, Kushner told the New York Times he was not aware of his father-in-law's reported past interest.The decision to clear the way for the development comes as Vucic's government seeks to maintain good relations with both Washington and Moscow.Serbia has been impacted by both Trump's tariffs and sanctions on Russian interests in the country, including on its sole oil-refinery, the majority Russian-owned Nafna Industrika Srbije (NIS).",

    "body": "2 days agoSteve Mellen and Alys DaviesA former British soldier is facing extradition to Kenya in connection with the alleged murder of a 21-year-old woman there in 2012.The National Crime Agency (NCA) said Robert James Purkiss was arrested in Tidworth, Wiltshire on 6 November and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday.He was arrested by specialist officers from the NCA's National Extradition Unit in connection with the killing of Agnes Wanjiru after a warrant was issued in September, the agency added.Mr Purkiss, 38, told the court he intended to contest the extradition and was remanded into custody ahead of his next appearance at the same court on 14 November.His lawyers told the court that he \"vehemently denies\" murder.Ms Wanjiru's body was discovered in a septic tank near a hotel in the town of Nanyuki, about 124 miles (200km) north of Nairobi, three months after she had gone missing on 31 March 2012. She had a five-month-old baby at the time.Her body was found near a British army training camp. On the night she was killed, she had reportedly been at a bar with friends where British soldiers were also present. Ms Wanjiru's niece, Esther Njoki, met the UK's defence minister last month in order to push for Mr Purkiss's extradition. In a statement issued through Leigh Day, the lawyers acting for Ms Wanjiru's family, on Friday Ms Njoki said: \"My family is incredibly relieved to hear that the suspect in my aunt's case has been arrested.\"We have waited so many years for this moment which marks an important step towards finally obtaining justice for our beloved Agnes.\"Leigh Day partner Tessa Gregory said: \"This is a huge moment for our client and her family who have been fighting for over a decade to obtain justice for Agnes.\"We hope the UK and Kenyan authorities will now work together to ensure that the suspect can face trial in Kenya as quickly as possible.\"Ms Wanjiru's family has long accused the British army of covering up her death and the Kenyan authorities of failing to properly investigate the case at the time.An inquest into her death was opened in 2018 following pressure from Ms Wanjiru's family, as well as Kenyan rights groups and feminists.In 2019, it concluded that Ms Wanjiru had been unlawfully killed by one or two British soldiers and that she had suffered stab wounds to the chest and abdomen.Later in 2021, a Sunday Times investigation reported that a British soldier had confessed to colleagues that he killed Ms Wanjiru. The soldier left the army after the incident and reportedly continued to live in the UK.In 2024, the army announced it was launching an internal review into the conduct of British soldiers in Kenya, including in Nanyuki.It found 35 suspected cases of soldiers having engaged in sexual exploitation and abuse, including transactional sex, with local women - nine of these being after the army officially banned such conduct in 2022.",

Hamas has now returned all 20 living hostages and 23 out of 28 deceased hostages under the first phase of a ceasefire deal that started on 10 October. Four of the five dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis and one is Thai.Israel has criticised Hamas for not yet returning all the bodies. Hamas says it is hard to find them under rubble.PIJ is an armed group allied with Hamas. It took part in the 7 October attack and previously held some Israeli hostages. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a campaign group, welcomed the return.\"Lior's return provides some measure of comfort to a family that has lived with agonising uncertainty and doubt for over two years,\" it said in a statement. \"We will not rest until the last hostage is brought home.\"During the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza. Israel has also handed over the bodies of 300 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 20 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas, along with those of three foreign hostages - one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.MOHAMMED SABER/EPA/ShutterstockHamas's military wing stood guard as they searched for hostage bodies on 5 November The parties also agreed to an increase of aid to the Gaza Strip, a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a halt to fighting, although violence has flared up as both sides accused one another of breaching the deal.Israel launched air strikes after accusing Hamas fighters of killing two of its soldiers on 19 October and of killing another soldier on 28 October. Hamas said it was unaware of clashes in the area of the first incident and had no connection to the second attack.Israeli military actions have killed at least 241 people since the start of the ceasefire, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage. All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were abducted in the attack.At least 69,169 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, the health ministry reported.",

    "body": "9 hours agoOttilie Mitchell and Harry SekulichUS aviation authorities have ordered that all models of a cargo plane that crashed mid-takeoff in Kentucky on Tuesday be grounded.It comes after a Boeing MD-11 aircraft operated by UPS burst into flames on the runway of Louisville International Airport before colliding into neighbouring businesses, killing 14 people. The American delivery firm had earlier said it would not operate the planes pending an ongoing investigation, with FedEx then following suit.Now the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a formal notice banning all MD-11 and MD11F aircraft from flying until safety checks are carried out.In total, 70 models are in use with UPS, FedEx and Western Global Airlines.FAA officials said the Kentucky crash happened after the plane's left engine caught fire and detached from the wing during take-off. The aircraft was carrying 38,000 gallons (144,000 litres) of fuel as it took off for a flight to Hawaii, which contributed to the size of the fire after the crash.A total of 14 people were killed in the crash and subsequent fire, including one person who had been admitted to hospital, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg has said.He said the number of dead now matches the number of people who were reported missing, indicating officials do not expect the death toll to climb further.Boeing said it welcomed the directive and that it had already advised the three firms which use the model to stop operating it out of \"an abundance of caution\".It is unclear whether the order will impact delivery services in the US, with none of the three companies reporting disruption so far.Data collated by the live air traffic website FlightRadar24 showed 55 MD-11 planes were used over the past week. \"Contingency plans are in place to flex our integrated air and ground network to help protect time-sensitive, critical shipments such as lifesaving pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and other products move through our network without disruption,\" FedEx said in a statement.UPS also said contingency plans were in place to continue its service. A statement continued: \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.\"The final passenger flights using an MD-11 was in 2014, with the model used exclusively as a cargo carrier since.The model of aircraft involved in the crash was an MD-11F triple-engine plane, which first entered service 34 years ago with Thai Airways as a passenger jet, but was transferred to UPS in 2006.MD-11s were originally manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, before the company merged with Boeing in 1997. Production of MD-11 planes ended in 2000.",

    "body": "8 hours agoAndré Rhoden-PaulEPADonald Trump has said the US will not attend the G20 summit in South Africa over widely discredited claims that white people are being persecuted in the country. The US president said it was a \"total disgrace\" that South Africa is hosting the meeting, where leaders from the world's largest economies will gather in Johannesburg later this month. South Africa's foreign ministry described the decision by the White House as \"regrettable\", while a spokesman for the foreign ministry, Chrispin Phiri, told BBC News that the success of the summit will not \"rest on one member state\".None of South Africa's political parties claim that there is a genocide in South Africa.That includes parties that represent Afrikaners and the white community in general.  Speaking to the Newshour programme, Mr Phiri said that Trump was \"orchestrating an imagined crisis… using the painful history of South Africa's colonial past\".He also said there was \"absolutely no evidence of white persecution in South Africa\", adding: \"South Africa does have its problems and we are dealing with those. I think crime affects everyone, regardless of their race.\"\"We will move on without the United States,\" he said.Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social: \"It is a total disgrace that the G20 will be held in South Africa.\"Afrikaners (people who are descended from Dutch settlers, and also French and German immigrants) are being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated,\" he wrote.\"No US government official will attend as long as these human rights abuses continue.\"South Africa's government said the claims of a white genocide are \"widely discredited and unsupported by reliable evidence\".The claims were dismissed as \"clearly imagined\" by a South African court in February.Trump had earlier said South Africa should not be in the G20 at all, and that he would send vice-president JD Vance, instead of attending himself. But now the White House says no US official will go.ReutersDonald Trump  confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in May Every year, a different member state hosts the G20 and sets the agenda for the summit - with the US due to take its turn after South Africa.The South African foreign ministry said in a statement: \"The South African government wishes to state, for the record, that the characterisation of Afrikaners as an exclusively white group is ahistorical. \"Furthermore, the claim that this community faces persecution, is not substantiated by fact.\"Since returning to office in January, Trump has repeatedly accused South Africa of discriminating against its white minority, including in May when when he confronted his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa in the Oval Office. The Trump administration has given Afrikaners refugee status, on the basis of the discredited \"genocide\" claims. Last week, the White House announced plans to cap refugee admissions at a record low, and give priority to white South Africans. The South African government has pointed to the \"limited uptake\" of the offer by South Africans. The G20 was founded in 1999 after the Asian financial crisis. The nations involved have more than 85% of the world's wealth and its aim was to restore economic stability.The first leaders' summit was held in 2008 in response to that year's global financial turmoil, to promote international co-operation.Now the leaders get together each year - along with representatives of the European Union and African Union - to talk about the world's economies and the issues countries are facing.",

    "body": "60 minutes agoKathryn Armstrong and André Rhoden-Paul and Lulu Luo,Aurora, Philippines The BBC's Jonathan Head says the Philippines is braced for an \"absolutely massive storm\"More than 900,000 people have been evacuated as the Philippines braces for Typhoon Fung-wong to make landfall. The storm, which is expected to make landfall on Sunday evening, was upgraded to super typhoon with sustained winds around 185 km/h (115mph) and gusts of 230km/h (143mph). The country's meteorological service has warned there is a \"high-risk of life-threatening and damaging storm surge with peak heights exceeding 3m [10ft]\" as the storm moves in a north-westerly across towards Luzon - the Philippine's most populous island. Fung-wong - known locally as Uwan - comes days after an earlier storm, Kalmaegi, left a trail of destruction and nearly 200 people dead.The eastern Bicol region was the first part of the Philippines to be directly hit by the storm on Sunday morning, before making its way past the Polillo Islands on Sunday afternoon. Several schools have either cancelled classes on Monday or moved them online, while nearly 300 flights have been cancelled. Fung-wong is expected to weaken after making landfall somewhere between the districts of Baler and Casiguran, but it is likely to remain a typhoon as it travels over Luzon.Over 200mm of rain is forecast for parts of Luzon, even 100-200mm in the Metro Manilla area. This is expected to cause severe flooding and landslides.  Eastern parts of the Philippines have already begun experiencing heavy rains and winds, a weather official said on Saturday evening.While much of the country is expected to be affected, there are particular concerns about those areas that could take a direct hit, including Catanduanes, an island in the east of the Bicol region, where extreme conditions were reported on Sunday morning.Residents there, as well as in other low-lying and coastal areas, had been urged to move to higher ground by Sunday morning.In the Aurora region, in eastern Luzon, BBC News spoke to Hagunoy, 21, who works at one of the dozen hotels which line the coast in Sabang.He said police had repeatedly visited in recent days to ensure all guests were evacuated ahead of the storm. The hotels were all deserted on Sunday morning.While the tide had risen sharply, Hagunoy said he would stay as long as he could to guard the property, before riding his motorbike home to safety. Staff had secured the gates and tied windows shut with rope to try to stop the glass from shattering in the wind.EPA/ShutterstockThe Filipino Coast Guard undertook evacuations ahead of the typhoon in Quezon provinceHow do hurricanes or typhoons form and are they getting stronger?In central Aurora more than 200 people arrived at a shelter in a sports centre. Many parents have brought young children, too young to remember Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,000 people when it struck the Phillipines in 2013. Fung-wong has also forced the suspension of rescue operations following the passage of Kalmaegi, one of the strongest typhoons this year.Heavy rainfall sent torrents of mud down hillsides and into residential areas. Some poorer neighbourhoods were obliterated by the fast-moving flash floods.At least 204 people are now known to have died in the Philippines as a result of the earlier storm, while more than 100 are still missing. Five people also died in Vietnam, where strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows.Families gathered at this shelter in a sports centre in central Aurora in eastern LuzonThe Filipino government declared a state of calamity across the country after Typhoon Kalmaegi and in preparation for the coming storm.It has given government agencies more power to access emergency funds and fast-track deliveries of essential goods and services.For some Filipinos, the devastation wrought by Kalmaegi has left them even more anxious about the storm to come.\"We decided to evacuate because the recent typhoon brought floods in our area, and now I just want to keep my family safe,\" Norlito Dugan told the AFP news agency.He is among those who have taken shelter in a church in the city of Sorsogon in Luzon.Another resident, Maxine Dugan said: \"I'm here because the waves near my house are now huge.\"The Philippines - located near the area where Pacific Ocean tropical weather systems form - is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to cyclones.About 20 tropical cyclones form in that region every year, half of which affect the country directly.Climate change is not thought to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones worldwide.However, warmer oceans coupled with a warmer atmosphere - fuelled by climate change - have the potential to make those that do form even more intense. That can potentially lead to higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall, and a greater risk of coastal flooding.",

    "body": "12 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinGetty ImagesTravellers wait in a long line at a security checkpoint at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport on 6 NovemberMore than 1,400 flights to, from, or within the US were cancelled on Saturday after airlines were told this week to cut traffic during the federal government shutdown.Nearly 6,000 flights were also delayed, down from over 7,000 delays on Friday, according to flight tracker FlightAware. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced earlier in the week that it would be reducing air travel capacity by up to10% at 40 of the nation's busiest airports as air traffic controllers, who are working without pay during the shutdown,  report fatigue.Republicans and Democrats remain divided over how to end the impasse in Congress as the shutdown, which began 1 October, continues. Saturday marked the 39th day of the longest shutdown in history as Republicans and Democrats still have not agreed on a funding resolution to reopen the government.  Senators are in Washington over the weekend for bipartisan negotitations aimed at ending the shutdown, which is beginning to be felt by more and more Americans amid cuts to food aid payments and the flight disruptions. In a statement on Saturday, American Airlines urged \"leaders in Washington, D.C., to reach an immediate resolution to end the shutdown\".New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport was experiencing some of the longest wait times. As of Saturday afternoon, arrivals to the airport were delayed by an average of more than four hours, while departures from the airport were delayed by an average of 1.5 hours, according to the FAA. The airports with the most cancelled flights on Saturday, both to and from the location, were Charlotte/Douglas International, Newark Liberty International, and Chicago O'Hare International, according to FlightAware. Departures to John F Kennedy International, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, and La Guardia were delayed by nearly three hours, over 2.5 hours, and about an hour, respectively, the FAA reported as of Saturday afternoon.With the Thanksgiving holiday approaching on 27 November, it's one of the busiest travel seasons of the year in the US. It's not just commercial flights that have been affected. Restrictions on private jets are also in place, Secretary Duffy said in a Saturday post on X.  \"We've reduced their volume at high traffic airports — instead having private jets utilize smaller airports or airfields so busy controllers can focus on commercial aviation,\" Duffy wrote. \"That's only fair.\"And things will likely get worse in the coming days as the FAA increases the percentage of cancelled flights. On Thursday, the agency announced that the flight reductions would be gradual, starting at 4% of  flights on Friday before rising to 6% by 11 November, 8% by 13 November, and the full 10% by 14 November.The FAA said the cuts were necessary to maintain safety as air traffic controllers have been overworked during the shutdown. As essential workers, the controllers are required to continue working without pay, and as a result, many have called out sick or taken on second jobs to afford necessities, unions say. Watch: \"Devastating\" - Airline travellers react to flight reductionsThe controllers are just some of the 1.4 million federal workers who have either been working without pay or been put on forced during the shutdown.Another factor impacting air travel is that most of the Transportation Security Agency (TSA) 64,000 agents are also not being paid while the shutdown is in place.During the previous government shutdown, under US President Donald Trump in 2018, it was found that up to 10% of TSA staff chose to stay at home rather than work for free.",

    "body": "20 hours agoNick ThorpeBudapest, HungaryOn the surface, the Hungarian prime minister's trip was exactly what he went to Washington for: luxuriant praise and an exemption from sanctions on Russian oil, gas and nuclear supplies.And all that just five months out from a difficult election.Look closer, however, and the picture is less clear cut. The US side struck a hard trade deal - and an expensive one for Hungary. And there's no progress on Viktor Orban's biggest headache: ending the war in neighbouring Ukraine, and with it the long shadow the conflict casts over Hungary.Let's look first at Orban's key win - an exemption from US sanctions, which a White House official told the BBC was time-limited to one year, although Péter Szijjártó, Hungary's foreign minister, said would be indefinite.The time span is interesting. Trump clearly wants to help his friend win the election in April. And the exemption even partially dovetails with the European Commission demand to all member states to end the import of Russian oil, gas and nuclear fuel by the end of 2027. What is missing, from an EU perspective, is any political commitment from Orban to meet that demand - a commitment made and fulfilled by the Czech government. And the EU is trying to tighten energy sanctions - to the fury of Hungary and Slovakia.Away from the media spotlight, the Hungarian energy company MOL has been upgrading two of its refineries - Százhalombatta in Hungary and the Slovnaft facility in Bratislava - to process Brent crude instead of the high-sulphur Urals crude which flows through Russian pipelines. On Friday, MOL said 80% of its oil needs could be imported through the Adria pipeline from Croatia, albeit with higher logistical costs and technical risks. So Orban's argument, which so impressed Trump, that Hungary, as a landlocked country, has no alternative to Russian oil may not strictly be true. Overall, Hungary and Slovakia have together paid Russia $13bn (£10bn) for its oil between its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the end of 2024. The one-year window granted by the US is nevertheless a valuable respite for Hungarian households this winter. Orban told pro-government reporters who travelled with him to Washington that otherwise utility bills \"could have gone up by up to three times in December\". Capping those bills by various means has been a central plank of his popularity in Hungary since 2013. Under the US exemption, Hungary can also continue to buy Russian gas through the Turkstream pipeline, which traverses the Balkans, and pay for it in hard currency ($185m in August alone) using a Bulgarian loophole. Orban has agreed to buy LNG from the US worth $600 million, according to Bloomberg.Another key part of the Washington deal is nuclear. Hungary agreed to buy US nuclear fuel rods for its Paks 1 nuclear power station (at a cost of $114m), in parallel to those bought from Russia's Rosatom and France's Framatome.Russian plans to finance and build the nuclear extension, called Paks 2, have been long delayed by technical and licensing issues. The US agreement to lift all nuclear sanctions on Hungary may help restart that project, but thorny problems remain. Hungary has also agreed to buy US technology to extend the short-term storage of spent nuclear fuel at Paks for between $100m and $200m.Perhaps the biggest part of the deal was a Hungarian commitment to buy up to 10 small modular nuclear reactors from the US, for somewhere between $10bn and $20bn. Hungary needs electricity to power the huge Chinese battery plants being built around the country. Smaller nuclear plants are less plagued by building delays, and are easier to licence.Finally, a currency swap deal - similar to a recent US-Argentina deal to prop up the peso - under which US and Hungarian central banks can exchange currency is being discussed.This would mean that in a future financial crisis in Hungary, the US central bank could feed dollars to Budapest, which boosts financial security in Hungary.So in summary, Hungary struck a deal to buy US gas, nuclear energy and unspecified weapons systems in exchange for a temporary waiver from US sanctions on Russian oil and gas. But it failed to get the re-introduction of the US-Hungary dual taxation system, abolished in 2022, which harms mutual trade. And it did not get a new date for a potential Trump-Putin summit in Budapest as part of efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war.Critics say energy dependence on Russia is being replaced by energy dependence on the US. The Orban government argues it is achieving greater diversity of supply.",

    "body": "37 minutes agoAmy WalkerSir Richard Knighton: \"We don't yet know... the source of those drones\"UK military personnel and equipment are being sent to Belgium to help it bolster its defences after drone incursions on its airspace, suspected of being carried out by Russia.The new head of the UK military, Sir Richard Knighton, told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that his Belgian counterpart asked for assistance earlier this week and that kit and personnel were on the way.Belgium's main airport Zavantem was forced to close temporarily on Thursday night after drones were spotted nearby. They were also spotted in other locations, including a military base.Sir Richard said it was not known if the incursions were by Russia, but added it was \"plausible\" they had been ordered by Moscow.In a statement, Defence Secretary John Healey said: \"As hybrid threats grow, our strength lies in our alliances and our collective resolve to defend, deter and protect our critical infrastructure and airspace\".Alongside Nato allies, he added that the UK would help Belgium \"by providing our kit and capability\" which he said was already being deployed. On Friday the German defence ministry said it would support Belgium with anti-drone measures after a request from Brussels.About 3,000 Brussels Airlines passengers were affected by the disruption, and the carrier said it faced \"considerable costs\" from cancelling or diverting dozens of flights.German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius and the Belgian security services have said they suspect Russia, but Belgian Defence Minister Theo Francken has previously admitted there is no accompanying evidence.\"At first, drones flying over our military bases were seen as our problem,\" Francken said earlier this week.\"Now it has become a serious threat affecting civilian infrastructure across multiple European countries.\"Getty ImagesDrone incursions over Western Europe could have been sent by the Kremlin, Sir Richard saidMore broadly, Sir Richard said Russia was \"the most pressing threat right now\" to Europe. \"The illegal invasion of Ukraine has shown the barbaric nature of Russia's war efforts,\" he told the programme.He added that sabotage and killings had been carried out by Russia on UK soil, and that so-called hybrid warfare is where \"we [The UK] need to strengthen ourselves\".The shadow defence secretary welcomed the move, saying there was \"a heightened threat environment\" and a key part of deterring threats was \"by acting with other countries through Nato\". But James Cartlidge also criticised the government's approach to increasing defence spending, saying more urgency was needed.In spring, the government announced defence spending would rise to 2.5% of GDP from April 2027, with an ambition to reach 3% in the next parliament. Sir Richard said the funding was \"more than I've ever known in my career\".In recent months, a number of drone sightings have caused major flight disruptions across Europe, including in Sweden, Norway and Denmark.Despite some officials blaming \"hybrid warfare\" by Russia, the Kremlin has denied any involvement.Pistorious has suggested the latest sightings could be linked to European Union discussions to use frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine in the form of a €140bn loan.While there is no public proof of Russia's involvement, suspicions have been fuelled by more serious airspace incursions by Russia in Eastern Europe over recent months, involving fighter jets and larger attack drones.The UK has recently sent RAF Typhoon jets to take part in defence missions over Poland as part of Nato's mission to bolster the eastern flank in response to incursions.",

    "body": "1 day agoMadeline Halpert and Christal HayesNobel Prize-winning American scientist James Watson, one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, has died aged 97. In one of the greatest breakthroughs of the 20th Century, he identified the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953 alongside British scientist Francis Crick, setting the stage for rapid advances in molecular biology.But Watson's reputation and standing were badly hurt by his comments on race and sex. In a TV programme, he made claims about genes causing a difference in average IQ between black and white people.His death was confirmed by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he worked and researched for decades, before having to resign as its chancellor over the comments.Watson shared the Nobel in 1962 with Maurice Wilkins and Francis Crick for the DNA's double helix structure discovery.\"We have discovered the secret of life,\" they said at the time. By the early 2000s, he had been largely ostracised by the scientific community over his comments on race and gender.In 2007, the scientist told the Times newspaper that he was \"inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\", because \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours - whereas all the testing says not really\".He apologised \"unreservedly\", but nevertheless, the comments led to him losing his job as chancellor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York.Additional comments he made in 2019 - when he once again suggested a link between race and intelligence - led to the lab stripping his honorary titles of chancellor emeritus, Oliver R Grace professor emeritus and honorary trustee.\"Dr Watson's statements are reprehensible, unsupported by science,\" the laboratory said in a statement at the time.DNA was discovered in 1869 but it took until 1943 for scientists to discover that it made up the genetic material in cells. Still, the structure of DNA remained a mystery. Working with images obtained by King's College researcher Rosalind Franklin, without her knowledge, Crick and Watson were able to construct a physical model of the molecule. Maurice Wilkins, who shared the Nobel with Crick and Watson, had worked with Franklin to determine the DNA molecule's structure. Franklin, who died in 1958, is today recognised for the integral role she played in the scientific breakthrough of DNA research, despite her work largely being written out of the story at the time.Former colleagues have commented that Watson nurtured the careers of female scientists at Harvard in the 1950s and 60s, at a time when that was not the norm. However he also made disparaging comments about women in science, and wrote sexist remarks about Franklin, including commenting on her appearance, in his 1968 best-selling book, The Double Helix.Watson became the first living Nobel laureate to sell his gold medal, fetching $4.8m (£3.6m) at an auction in 2014, saying he was letting go of it because he felt ostracised by the scientific community after his controversial remarks.A Russian billionaire bought it for $4.8m and promptly gave it back to him.James Watson was born in Chicago in April 1928 to Jean and James, descendants of English, Scottish and Irish settlers.He won a scholarship to study at the University of Chicago at the age of 15.  There, he became interested in the new technique of diffraction, in which X-rays were bounced off atoms to reveal their inner structures.To pursue his research into DNA structures, he went to Cambridge University in England, where he met Crick, with whom he began constructing large-scale models of possible structures.Later, after his scientific discovery, Watson and his wife, Elizabeth, moved to Harvard, where he became professor of biology. The couple had two sons - one of whom was diagnosed with schizophrenia as a teenager, further motivating Watson's research to learn more about DNA in the hope of possibly helping him.In 1968, he took over the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York State - an old institution which he was credited with turning into one of the world's foremost scientific research institutes.",

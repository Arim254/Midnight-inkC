    "body": "41 minutes agoAleks PhillipsGetty ImagesStock image of a residential street in Suriname's capital, ParamariboNine people including five children have been stabbed to death on the outskirts of Suriname's capital, Paramaribo, police have said.Another adult and child were taken to hospital after sustaining serious injuries in the attack, city police said in a statement.Officers were called to an address on a road leading out of the capital on Saturday night, where they detained a male suspect after shooting him in the leg. He was also taken to hospital for treatment and is under police guard.Local media has suggested the man was suffering from mental health issues, citing officials and residents, while the South American nation's president said his family and neighbours were among the victims.\"At a time when family and friends should be holding on to and supporting each other, we are confronted with the harsh reality that there is another side to the world,\" Jennifer Geerlings-Simons said in a statement.\"I wish all the bereaved much strength, courage and comfort during this unimaginably difficult time.\"Police said further details about the circumstances of the incident would follow. Suriname is among nations with the lowest rates of stabbing deaths, making incidents such as this one relatively rare.However, it has endured several coups and a civil war since gaining its independence from the Netherlands in 1975.",

    "body": "A cruise ship has run aground in Papua New Guinea (PNG) on its first trip since the death of an elderly passenger in late October. The Coral Adventurer is currently under investigation over the death of Suzanne Rees, 80, who died on a remote Australian island after being left behind by the ship. On Saturday, the vessel suffered a \"grounding incident\" off the eastern coast of PNG, around 30km (18 miles) from the city of Lae, a spokesperson for the ship said. All passengers and crew aboard the cruise ship have been reported safe, and initial inspections have not revealed any damage to the hull. Further inspections will take place on Sunday. A spokesperson for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) told the BBC in a statement that it had not received a distress call from the Coral Adventurer.It added it was monitoring the situation and would support PNG authorities if necessary. No decisions have been made about the current 12-day voyage, which was due to finish on 30 December.There were 80 passengers and 43 crew members aboard the ship at the time of the incident.The Coral Adventurer is currently the subject of a joint investigation by Amsa and Queensland Police, Ms Rees was found dead on Lizard Island on 26 October.She had been hiking on the island with fellow passengers, but broke off from the group for a rest. The ship left without her and returned several hours later after the crew realised the woman was missing.A major search operation found her body the following day.The ship was just two days into a 60-day voyage at the time of Ms Rees's death. The remainder of the cruise was cancelled with full refunds offered to all passengers.  The CEO of Coral Expeditions, Mark Fifield, said that the company was \"deeply sorry that this has occurred\" and had offered its full support to the Rees family.Mr Fifield added that the cruise operator was \"working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation\".Amsa was not able to comment on the status of the investigation, and told the BBC that it was \"not in the practice of making the results of its investigations public\".

    "body": "8 hours agoSebastian UsherMiddle East analystThe number of executions in Iran in 2025 is estimated to have more than doubled compared to the number that took place across the country in 2024. Norwegian-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) group told the BBC it had verified at least 1,500 executions up until the start of December, adding that many more have taken place since.Last year, IHR was able to verify 975 executions - although the exact number is never completely clear as Iranian authorities do not give official figures.However, the analysis shows another significant annual rise, and the figures chime with those provided by other monitoring groups.Iran's government has previously defended its use of the death penalty, saying it is limited to only \"the most severe crimes\".Execution figures were already on the rise before mass demonstrations broke out across the country in 2022 following the death in custody of Mahsa Amini.The 22-year-old Kurdish woman was detained by morality police in Tehran for allegedly wearing her hijab \"improperly\".That protest movement represented the biggest challenge to the legitimacy of Iran's theocratic leadership for many years.In response, authorities intensified the rate of executions from around 520 in 2022 to 832 the following year - according to the figures verified by IHR.There have been some executions for protesters or alleged spies - but 99% of those executed have been for murder or drug offences - a ratio which has remained constant.Activists have said that the rate of executions in Iran increases when the regime feels under threat and that the aim is to forestall internal opposition by instilling fear in the population.It seems to be borne out by the fact that since the 12-day war with Israel in June, as well as major setbacks for Iran's proxy forces across the region, there's been another big surge.",

The five identical sisters, born in Ontario at the height of the Great Depression in 1934, were the first known quintuplets to survive past infancy. They quickly became a global sensation during their childhood - starring in feature films, appearing on the covers of magazines, and endorsing products from toothpaste to syrup. \"Much beloved, Annette had championed children's rights,\" the museum said in a statement announcing her death. Getty ImagesThe Dionne quintuplets on their fourth birthday in 1938The museum, which seeks to preserve their legacy and educate the public on the quintuplets' controversial upbringing, added: \"She believed it was important to maintain the Dionne Quints Museum and the history it provides for the future of all children.\"The quintuplets - Annette, Yvonne, Cécile, Émilie and Marie - were taken away from their parents by the Ontario government when they were infants.For several years, the authorities displayed the children in a compound dubbed \"Quintland\", which became a popular tourist attraction.The children were constantly examined and observed, and had limited contact with their parents and siblings.Their parents later regained custody of the quintuplets.

    "body": "8 hours agoSebastian UsherMiddle East analystWidespread tributes have been shared for Bahram Beyzai, a giant of Iranian cinema and theatre, who has died aged 87 in the US.The front pages of Iranian newspapers mourn his loss, with opposition voices and those who look back fondly on the Shah era also paying homage to Beyzai.Prince Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the last Shah of Iran, described his passing as \"a great loss for the the art and culture of our country\".Although Beyzai's later films were banned in the 1980s by the Islamic regime that toppled the Shah, a number of senior figures in the current government have also paid tribute to his contribution to Iranian culture.Several of the current crop of Iranian filmmakers have acknowledged their debt to him, with Jaafar Panahi - whose latest film won the top prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival - saying that he taught them \"how to stand up to oblivion\".Beyzai avoided direct political references in his work, both as a playwright and a film director, and always said he tried not to trade in overt messages.But his work over many decades sets historical, even mythic figures in conflict with oppressive religious and political systems.From a family of celebrated poets, Beyzai was imbued in the deepest traditions of Persian culture from birth.He first found fame as a playwright, drawing on Persian legend and ritual.A lifelong fan of cinema, he moved into making films in the 1970s.He won renown as one of the key figures in the new wave of Iranian cinema.His most productive period straddled the era of the Shah and then the Islamic theocratic forces that deposed him - with both systems ever ready to sniff out hidden messages that could be interpreted as dissent.As Jaafar Panahi has put it in his tribute: \"Beyzai did not choose the easy way. He endured years of exclusion, imposed silence, and distance, but he did not give up his language and his beliefs.\"A few years after the Iranian Revolution, he produced what many regard as his masterpiece, Bashu, the Little Stranger, about a small boy who tries to take refuge from the Iran-Iraq war. It was banned in Iran - as were other films he made in that period - but later voted by film critics as the greatest Iranian film of all time.The film was shown in a restored version at this year's Venice Film Festival, winning an award for best film in the classics section.Beyzai finally left Iran in 2010, and spent his later years in the US where he taught Iranian culture.Although he left his homeland, his wife, the actress Mozhdeh Shamsai, said just hearing the word Iran would still bring tears to his eyes - and he remained ever hopeful of a new culture and future for his homeland.",

    "body": "Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro has received a medical procedure to treat his chronic hiccups, his medical team has said.Saturday's treatment \"went well\", according to one of his doctors. Another, Claudio Birolini, added that the procedure - which he stressed was not a surgery - lasted for \"about an hour\".The far-right former leader is currently serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup after he lost the Latin American nation's 2022 presidential election to left-wing opponent Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.This latest procedure comes after the 70-year-old successfully underwent surgery for a double hernia earlier this week, after being granted permission to be transferred to hospital.Ahead of the surgery, Bolsonaro also endorsed his son Flávio to run against Lula in Brazil's 2026 presidential election. His statement - a handwritten letter - was read out by the younger Bolsonaro outside the hospital.Following the successful surgery, his medical team deemed it necessary to treat his recurrent hiccups, which he had been suffering from for months.\"It's been nine months of struggle and anguish with daily hiccups,\" Bolsonaro's wife, Michelle, said on Saturday.She explained in a social media post that her husband's procedure had \"blocked\" one of his phrenic nerves.The phrenic nerves contract and expand the diaphragm, which allows the lungs to inhale and exhale. Hiccups are caused by the involuntary spasming of the diaphragm, typically as a result of an irritated phrenic nerve.His doctors later confirmed they had treated the right phrenic nerve and had scheduled to work on the left nerve on Monday.Once discharged from hospital, the former president will return to a cell in the federal police headquarters to continue serving his sentence. Bolsonaro was found guilty of the coup plot in September. He was placed under house arrest pending appeals, but was taken into police custody last month after being deemed a \"concrete flight risk\".Court officials said he had attempted to break his ankle monitor and planned to use a rally outside his house as cover for an escape attempt. Bolsonaro insisted he had no intention of fleeing.Also on Saturday, Brazil's Supreme Court ordered the house arrest of 10 officials for participating in his coup attempt. All of them had served in his government.",

    "body": "1 day agoKwasi Gyamfi AsieduWatch: President Trump's name added to facade of Kennedy CenterThe head of the Kennedy Center in Washington DC has demanded $1m (£740,000) in damages from a musician who cancelled a concert after US President Donald Trump's name was added to the venue.Chuck Redd called off his Christmas Eve performance, which he has hosted annually since 2006, citing a vote by the board to rename the site the Trump Kennedy Center.The centre's president Richard Grenell wrote in a letter that the cancellation was a \"political stunt\" and \"has cost us considerably\". Redd did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Shortly after taking office, Trump fired several of the board members and replaced them with allies, who then voted to make Trump chairman of the board.Grenell wrote in his letter to Redd that his no-show was \"classic intolerance and very costly to a non-profit Arts institution\".He added: \"Your dismal ticket sales and lack of donor support, combined with your last-minute cancellation has cost us considerably. \"This is your official notice that we will seek $1m in damages from you for this political stunt.\"Last week, the White House announced the centre's board had voted unanimously to rename the cultural institution as The Donald J Trump and John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.A day later, crews could be seen etching the president's name onto the building's façade. Its website and some social media accounts were also renamed.The White House said the renaming effort was in recognition of Trump's actions to renovate the building, but the move was criticised by Democrats, several artists and members of the Kennedy family. \"When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,\" Redd, a drummer and vibraphone player, told the Associated Press news agency earlier this week.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesNew sign at the Kennedy CenterCongresswoman Joyce Beatty, a Democrat from Ohio, recently filed a lawsuit seeking to remove Trump's name from the centre.She argued in her lawsuit that, because the centre was named in a 1964 law, changing its name should require \"an act of Congress\".The lawsuit says Beatty had phoned into the meeting about the name change, but was muted when she tried to voice her opposition. She is one of several lawmakers designated as members of the board by US law. Work on a national performing arts centre began in the 1950s, and after Kennedy, the 35th president, was assassinated in 1963, Congress decided to turn it into a living memorial to him.",

Further north, regional utility company Hemab said one of its employees died in an accident while out working.Police also said a man in his 60s was taken to hospital after being hit by a tree while working in a forest in Hofors, east-central Sweden, and later died of his injuries.Tens of thousands of homes in Sweden, Norway and Finland have been left without power as a result of the storm.In Sweden, more than 40,000 homes were affected by power outages and numerous rail services were cancelled, Swedish news agency TT reported.Several flights, rail and ferry services across parts of the Nordic nations have been cancelled. Roads and rail services have also been disrupted due to the storm conditions.In Norway's Nordland region, one of the most northerly counties in the country, the fire department responded to more than 200 weather‑related incidents, broadcaster NRK reported.Storm Johannes cut power to around 23,000 homes in Nordland and a further 9,000 were without electricity in the Inland region, according to NRK.In Finland, the storm - known there as Hannes - subsided on Sunday morning but had left more than 60,000 homes without power, according to public broadcaster Yle.Flights at Kittila airport in northern Finland were grounded after heavy winds pushed a passenger jet and a smaller plane off the runway and into a bank of snow, the Helsinki Times reported.The Swiss Air jet, carrying about 150 passengers, had just landed from Geneva and was taxiing when it veered off, the paper said. The smaller jet, a 400XT model, was on the ground at the same time and was also pushed off course by the wind, it added.There have been no reported injuries.",

    "body": "Italian police have arrested nine people accused of raising around €7m (£6m) for Hamas over more than two years.The money was ostensibly collected as humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians, a police statement said, but was instead sent to the militant group via a \"complex fundraising system\".Alongside the arrests, police say they have seized more than €8m (£7m) in assets as part of the investigation. Police say the suspects are \"specifically accused of carrying out financing operations believed to have contributed to terrorist activities\".The arrests were made as part of a joint initiative between Italy's counter-terror police and financial police.The investigation began after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack in southern Israel. Police say they analysed \"a series of reports of suspicious financial transactions\" involving some of the suspects in the lead up to the attack.Investigators uncovered a \"complex\" system of fundraising, which was headquartered in Genoa with branches in Milan, the statement adds.\"The suspects collected donations intended for the civilian population of Gaza, however, it emerged that over 71% of these funds were diverted to Hamas's coffers to finance its military wing and support the families of suicide bombers or those detained for terrorism,\" the police statement says.Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said the most well-known of the arrested suspects was Mohammad Hannoun, the president of the Palestinian Association in Italy.Piantedosi thanked police for their work in a post on X, but also noted that \"the presumption of innocence... must always be recognised at this stage\".Mr Hannoun said that he is \"neither closely nor remotely\" related to Hamas but has always supported them. \"I have always declared with utmost transparency that I am a Palestinian citizen and publicly support the legitimate resistance of the Palestinian people,\" he told reporters.",

    "body": "1 day agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondentandTabby WilsonA ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia has come into effect along the border, where almost three weeks of deadly clashes have forced nearly one million people from their homes.In a joint statement, the defence ministers of the two countries agreed to freeze the front lines where they are now, ban reinforcements and allow civilians living in border areas to return as soon as possible.The ceasefire took effect at noon local time (05:00 GMT) on Saturday. Once it has been in place for 72 hours, 18 Cambodian soldiers held by Thailand since July will be released, the statement said.The breakthrough came after days of talks between the two countries, with diplomatic encouragement from China and the US.The agreement prioritises getting the displaced back to their homes, and also includes an agreement to remove landmines.Thailand's Defence Minister Natthaphon Narkphanit described the ceasefire as a test for the \"other party's sincerity\".\"Should the ceasefire fail to materialise or be violated, Thailand retains its legitimate right to self-defence under international law,\" he told reporters.UN human rights chief Volker Türk said he hopes the ceasefire will \"pave the way\" for peace, while an EU spokesperson urged \"good faith\" in its implementation.Thailand had been reluctant to accept the ceasefire, saying the last one was not properly implemented. They also resented what they saw as Cambodia's efforts to internationalise the conflict.Unlike the last ceasefire in July, US President Donald Trump was conspicuously absent from this one, although the US State Department was involved.That ceasefire agreement collapsed earlier this month, when fresh clashes erupted. Both sides blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce.The Thai army said its troops had responded to Cambodian fire in Thailand's Si Sa Ket province, in which two Thai soldiers were injured.Cambodia's defence ministry said it was Thai forces that had attacked first, in Preah Vihear province, and insisted that Cambodia did not retaliate.Clashes have continued throughout December. On Friday, Thailand carried out more air strikes inside Cambodia.The Thai Air Force said it had hit a Cambodian \"fortified military position\" after civilians had left the area. Cambodia's defence ministry said the strikes were \"indiscriminate attacks\" against civilian houses.How well the ceasefire holds this time depends to a large extent on political will. Nationalist sentiment has been inflamed in both countries.Cambodia, in particular, has lost many soldiers and a lot of its military equipment. It has been driven back from positions it held on the border, and suffered extensive damage from the Thai air strikes, grievances which could make a lasting peace harder to achieve.Disagreement over the border dates back more than a century, but tension increased early this year after a group of Cambodian women sang patriotic songs in a disputed temple.A Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash in May, and two months later, in July, there were five days of intense fighting along the border, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead. Thousands more civilians were displaced.Following intervention by Malaysia and President Trump, a fragile ceasefire was negotiated between the two countries, and signed in late October.Trump dubbed the agreement the \"Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords\". It mandated both sides to withdraw their heavy weapons from the disputed region, and to establish an interim observer team to monitor it.However, the agreement was suspended by Thailand in November after Thai soldiers were injured by landmines, with Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul announcing that the security threat had \"not actually decreased\".",

    "body": "1 day agoJaroslav LukivandMakuochi OkaforBBCOne strike hit a field near a village in Sokoto stateThe US has launched \"powerful and deadly\" strikes against militants linked to the Islamic State group (IS) in north-western Nigeria, where militants have sought to establish a foothold, President Donald Trump said. Trump told Politico he ordered the 25 December strikes as \"a Christmas present\" - contradicting a statement by Nigerian officials.Camps run by the group in Sokoto state were hit near the border with Niger, the US military said. Casualty numbers are unclear, but both US and Nigerian officials say militants were killed.Nigerian Foreign Minister Yusuf Maitama Tuggar told the BBC it was a \"joint operation\" and had \"nothing to do with a particular religion\".Tuggar said the strikes had been planned \"for quite some time\" using intelligence provided by Nigeria. He did not rule out further strikes. Referring to the timing of strikes - which took place late on Thursday - he said they did not have \"anything to do with Christmas\".But Trump told Politico otherwise in an interview. \"They were going to do it earlier,\" Trump said of the airstrikes. \"And I said, 'nope, let's give a Christmas present.'\"They didn't think that was coming, but we hit them hard. Every camp got decimated.\"The US military said an \"initial assessment\" suggested \"multiple\" fatalities in Sokoto state.A local official in the Tangaza area of Sokoto state, Isa Salihu Bashir, told the BBC the strikes had \"hit some Lakurawa terrorist camps\". He said many fighters had been killed but the death toll was unclear.The BBC has been unable to independently confirm casualty figures.Bashir added that border patrols on the Niger side reported seeing Lakurawa fighters fleeing the targeted areas.The Nigerian government has long been fighting an array of jihadist groups, including Boko Haram and IS-linked factions, but largely in the north-east. But in recent years a smaller group - known locally as Lakurawa - has sought to establish a base in north-western Sokoto state.Nigerian authorities say the group has links to jihadist networks in Mali and Niger. They add that its members have settled in border communities, recruited young people, and imposed harsh controls.Tangaza is made up of remote villages, whose residents are mostly moderate Muslims. In a statement late on Friday, Nigeria's information ministry said \"precision strike operations\" had been carried with the \"explicit approval\" of President Bola Tinubu and with \"the full involvement of the armed forces of Nigeria\".It also said that during the operation debris from munitions fell in two communities – the village of Jabo, also in Sokoto state, and Offa in Kwara state, about 600km (370 miles) to the south. No civilian casualties were reported in either location.Umar Jabo, an eyewitness in Jabo, told the BBC: \"Something that looked like a plane flashed and crashed... in fields.\" He said there was no issue with IS in the area: \"We live peacefully, and there is no conflict between us and Christians.\"The Trump administration has previously accused the Nigerian government of failing to protect Christians from jihadist attacks and has claimed a \"genocide\" is being perpetrated.Trump has labelled Nigeria a \"country of particular concern\", a designation used by the US state department that provides for sanctions against countries \"engaged in severe violations of religious freedom\".The US military was ordered to prepare to intervene in Nigeria in November.US Department of DefenseThe US defence department posted a short video that appears to show a missile being launched from a military vesselIn a social media post late on Christmas Day confirming the strikes, Trump said that he would \"not allow Radical Islamic Terrorism to prosper\".US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Thursday that he was \"grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation\". The Pentagon later posted a short video that appeared to show a missile being launched from a ship.Militants allied to IS have sought to establish a presence in two north-western states, while a separate IS-linked group has a stronghold in north-eastern BornoNigeria is Africa's most populous country, with about 220 million people, divided roughly evenly between Christians and Muslims.Jihadist groups such as Boko Haram and IS-linked offshoots have wrought havoc in north-eastern Nigeria for more than a decade, killing thousands of people.Most victims have been Muslims, according to Acled, a group that analyses political violence around the world.The strikes are the second major US intervention targeting IS in recent weeks.Last week, the US said it had carried out a \"massive strike\" against IS in Syria.US Central Command (Centcom) said fighter jets, attack helicopters and artillery had struck more than 70 targets. Aircraft from Jordan were also involved.Those strikes were launched in retaliation for the killing of three Americans - two soldiers and a civilian interpreter - in an ambush. ",

    "body": "A fracture in a straight section of track \"occurred prior to the passage\" of a high-speed train that derailed, causing last Sunday's rail disaster in which 45 people died, an initial report has found.A train run by private company Iryo derailed last Sunday and its rear carriages crossed on to the opposite track into the path of an oncoming train run by state-owned Renfe.The CIAF rail investigation commission said not only did Iryo train's front carriages which stayed on the track have \"notches\" in their wheels, but three earlier trains that went over the track earlier did too.A gap of almost 40cm (15in) in the track has become the focus of the investigation into the crash.Sunday's deadly collision occurred at around 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT), about an hour after the Iryo train left Málaga for Madrid.The train's last three carriages - carriages six to eight - derailed and collided with the Huelva-bound Renfe train. \"Carriage six derailed due to a complete lack of continuity in the track,\" the preliminary report finds.Most of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the state-operated train.Earlier this week, Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente confirmed reports that grooves were found on the wheels of the Iryo train's carriages, which had passed over the track safely.\"These notches in the wheels and the deformation observed in the track are compatible with the fact that the track was cracked,\" the CIAF preliminary report said.It added that three trains that had gone over the tracks at 17:21 on Sunday, 19:01 and then 19:09 had similar notches \"with a compatible geometric pattern\".Similar grooves are found on carriages two, three and four of the Iryo train, the report says, but carriage five  - the last that did not derail -  had a groove on its outer edge, suggesting the rail was already tilting outwards before carriage six derailed.The CIAF called its report a \"working hypothesis\", adding that it \"must be corroborated by later detailed calculations and analysis\".The transport minister appeared before reporters again on Friday to say that it was too early to have definitive answers, but that if the cause of the crash was the fracture, then it occurred in the minutes and hours before the derailment and could not have been detected.The Adamuz disaster is is the country's worst rail crash in more than a decade. In 2013, Spain suffered its worst high-speed train derailment in Galicia, north-west Spain, which left 80 people dead and 140 others injured.",

A source has told the BBC that some progress had been made but the key issue of territory remains unresolved.Russia occupies roughly 20% of Ukraine, including parts of the eastern Donbas region. The Kremlin wants Ukraine to hand over large areas of the territory. Ukraine has ruled this out.As the three-way talks in Abu Dhabi enter a second day, Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that three of the four people who had been injured had been hospitalised.He added that the capital's critical infrastructure had been damaged which had left 6,000 buildings without heating.Temperatures in Ukraine are at sub-zero levels and in a statement following the assaults, President Volodymyr Zelensky said: \"The main target of the Russians was the energy infrastructure.\"In Kharkiv, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said 19 people had been injured during the strikes in the early hours of Saturday morning. A maternity hospital and a hostel for displaced people were damaged.More from the BBC",

    "body": "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has weighed in on a separatist movement in Alberta, saying the western Canadian province is a \"natural partner for the US\". \"Alberta has a wealth of natural resources, but they won't let them build a pipeline to the Pacific,\" Bessent told an American right-wing commentator in an interview on Thursday. \"I think we should let them come down into the US, and Alberta is a natural partner for the US. They have great resources. The Albertans are very independent people.\" The top US official's comments come amid strained ties between US and Canada, and as signatures are being collected in the province seeking an independence referendum. In comments to conservative host Jack Posobiec, Bessent went on to say there is a \"rumour that they may have a referendum on whether they want to stay in Canada or not\". A group in Alberta has until May to collect at least 178,000 signatures - or 10% of eligible voters - for a referendum campaign. Asked about Bessent's remarks on Friday, federal Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said he'd tell him \"thanks but no thanks, we will do our own things\".He said Canadians are \"able to develop our natural resources at home\" and pointed to a deal recently inked by Prime Minister Mark Carney with Alberta that opens the door for an oil pipeline to the Pacific. It's a project long pushed for by Canada's oil heartland but one which faces significant hurdles.A spokesman for Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said in a statement to the BBC that the province supports new pipelines \"west, east, north, and south, and we will continue to work with our US partners on building more pipeline capacity to US markets\". \"But the premier also believes the overwhelming majority of Albertans are not interested in becoming a US state\".Late last year over 430,000 signatures were gathered for a petition calling for a united Canada to counter the separatist push, and polls indicate a majority of Albertans want to stay in Canada. Many supporters of separatism have also told media they are seeking independence from Canada - not to join the US. Mitch Sylvestre, who is spearheading the referendum petition, told the CBC on Friday he doesn't think anyone in his movement is eyeing the US.He said he thought Bessent's comment on Alberta and the US being \"natural partners\" was obvious given the energy trade between them.Still, some organisers of the movement have said they have travelled to Washington to meet officials from the Trump administration.Meanwhile, trade talks between the US and Canada are on ice, and President Donald Trump has expressed irritation with the prime minister over a blunt speech he delivered at the World Economic Forum in Davos calling out \"great powers\" for weaponising their economic might.Trump responded in his own speech with: \"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\"Other US officials have also criticised Carney's speech, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who this week accused Canada of being \"arrogant\" and Carney of pandering to a domestic audience by adopting an anti-US stance.",

    "body": "3 hours agoKaty Watson,Australia correspondentandHarry SekulichA young boy who was bitten by a shark in Sydney Harbour last week has died in hospital. Twelve-year-old Nico Antic had been jumping off a rock ledge with friends on 18 January when he was attacked by what authorities suspected was a bull shark.\"We are heartbroken to share that our son, Nico has passed away,\" his parents Lorena and Juan said in a statement. The incident was one of four reported shark attacks along the New South Wales coast over two days.\"Nico was a happy, friendly, and sporty young boy with the most kind and generous spirit. He was always full of life and that's how we'll remember him,\" his family, who were originally from Argentina, added.Nico's friends were praised for their bravery after jumping into the water to help him after he was attacked last Sunday afternoon.However he suffered serious leg injuries and was taken to Sydney Children's Hospital in a critical condition. He was placed in an induced coma after undergoing surgery.An online fundraiser set up for Nico's family has raised $240,000 (£121,308).There has been a spate of reported shark attacks along Australia's east coast in the past week, three of them in Sydney. On Monday, a surfer on Sydney's northern beaches escaped a lurking shark without physical injury, while hours later a 27-year-old man suffered \"life-changing\" injuries in a shark attack at a nearby beach. One day later, a man on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales was pulled from the water after surviving a shark bite.The man, 39, sustained a chest wound and was taken to hospital. The attacks followed several days of heavy rain, which experts say created a \"perfect storm\" of conditions for bull sharks who prefer murky water. They also say rain flushes nutrients into the water, which can draw sharks closer to shore.Beaches across Sydney were closed to protect the public until weather improved, many of which have reopened for the Australia Day public holiday long weekend.",

    "body": "'I saw people getting shot': Eyewitness tells of Iran protest crackdown17 hours agoSoroush PakzadParniaParnia was visiting family in Isfahan when the protests beganWarning: This story contains details which some readers might find distressing.An Iranian woman who witnessed the bloody crackdown on protests in Iran has described how her neighbourhood turned into a \"war zone\" as security forces opened fire at crowds with live ammunition.A government-imposed internet blackout in Iran, now in its third week, has prevented many accounts of what has happened from reaching the wider world.But some Iranians who have left the country have been able to share what they have seen.Parnia, who lives in London, told the BBC that she was visiting her family in the central city of Isfahan when the protests broke out in the capital, Tehran. They quickly spread across the country, and within days there were hundreds of protesters in the Hakim Nezami and Khaghani neighbourhoods of Isfahan.\"There were women and men from seven to 70 years old,\" she said. \"On just one street there were 200 to 300 people. People were chanting 'Death to the dictator' and 'Long live the shah'.\" The \"dictator\" was Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the shah a reference to Iran's late last monarch, overthrown in the 1979 Islamic revolution, and his son, the exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi.Isfahan has seen protests and crackdowns down the years. But Parnia said she had never seen anything like what happened during the recent unrest, which was sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency.First, security forces fired tear gas at the protesters, she said. Then they formed a line and fired birdshot.\"I saw people getting shot and falling down, and I saw blood on the street.\"Parnia said she ran away down alleyways and was suddenly pulled into an apartment block by a woman. Inside, she said, were many injured protesters.\"I saw the lobby floor covered in blood, and I saw a girl whose leg was full of pellets.\"Videos verified by the BBC from that night show large numbers of people in the streets in Isfahan. Some streets were blocked by traffic sign poles and large metal sheets, in an apparent effort by protesters to protect themselves from gunfire.Footage also showed protesters breaking through the gates of the building of the national broadcaster Irib, which was later set on fire.Phone footageThe building of the state broadcaster in Isfahan was set on fireOn Friday morning, 9 January, Khamenei said Iran would not back down from dealing with what he called \"destructive elements\", a day after US President Donald Trump had threatened to hit Iran \"very hard\" if authorities started killing people.Following Khamenei's speech, the powerful Revolutionary Guards sent a text message to people across Iran, telling them to avoid gatherings on streets in areas of unrest. The messages also warned against co-operating with what it described as \"terrorist mercenaries\" - an act it said would constitute treason.Despite the risks, Parnia went out to protest again on Friday evening.\"The protesters were hopeful,\" she said. \"You could see fear on everyone's faces. We were afraid to pass in front of the security forces and come closer together,\" she said.\"We thought even if we get killed, it would be a reason for Trump to act faster.\"Footage obtained by the BBC from the previous day shows large crowds on main streets in Parnia's neighbourhood. But she said on the Friday it was different.Phone footageHundreds of people gathered on the streets of Isfahan to protest\"Protesters were in small groups gathered in alleyways. Every time that someone tried to gather in the larger street, we could hear live fire sound followed by screams and shouts.\"Because of the internet blackouts, and protesters avoiding taking their phones with them, the BBC has not yet obtained footage from Friday night.Parnia also described a scene of \"total chaos\" at a local clinic that was treating wounded protesters.\"No phone lines were working. Nobody could call their families, and many refused to go to hospitals, fearing they could be arrested there,\" she said. \"All the nurses could do was clean the wounds and send them home. The next day you could still smell the tear gasses in the air. Security forces were present and there were checkpoints across the city.\"Parnia left Isfahan that same day and travelled to the capital, Tehran, to catch a flight back to London.\"I arrived in Tehran at 6pm. All the shops were closed and many people gathered in the streets. At 8pm everyone started to chant and I could hear gunshots,\" she said.\"The airport was so busy. Many foreign airlines were cancelled and people were frustrated. Luckily, I found an Iranian flight to leave.\"Since her return to the UK, Parnia has been in touch with her friends in Isfahan.She said she learned from a source that doctors at Feiz eye hospital in Isfahan had carried out around 300 surgical procedures to remove the eyes of patients with birdshot-related facial injuries.\"Every time you go out into the streets, you see random people with eye patches,\" Parnia's friends told her.According to several health workers who spoke to the BBC, hospitals are monitored and controlled by security forces, and people with gunshot wounds in Isfahan are being arrested.\"Many of the injured are developing infections. Some doctors are referring them to surgeons who can treat them in private clinics,\" Parnia's cited her friends as saying.While Iranian authorities have said around 3,000 people were killed during the protests, US-based human rights group HRANA has so far confirmed more than 4,600 deaths, with another 9,700 cases still under review. According to the group, at least 7,300 people have also sustained serious injuries. Many believe the true figures may be even higher.Parnia said she was now preparing to join Iranian opposition protests in the UK, saying she wants to be a voice for the silenced protesters.She also expressed anger at international media reports suggesting that Iranians and the country's political opposition was not united.\"Iranians have shown what they want in the streets and paid a high price for it.\"",

    "body": "A Canadian backpacker, who was found dead on an Australian beach and surrounded by a pack of dingoes earlier this week, likely died of drowning, an autopsy has found. Piper James, 19, had \"physical evidence consistent with drowning\" and \"injuries consistent with dingo bites\", a spokesperson for the Coroners Court of Queensland told BBC news.\"Pre-mortem dingo bite marks\" were unlikely to have caused her \"immediate death\", the spokesperson added. The autopsy was part of a preliminary assessment, and establishing her exact cause of death could take several weeks.Piper's body was found on a beach on K'Gari, an island off the eastern state of Queensland on Monday.In a statement to the BBC, the coroner also said there were \"extensive post-mortem dingo bite marks\" and that no evidence anyone else was involved.Piper's father, Todd James told Australia's 9News that the family felt relieved, as the autopsy results meant her body could be released back to her family in Canada.Her mother Angela told Global News that her daughter had always dreamed of travelling and had saved money for this trip after she graduated high school.Both parents had concerns about her travelling at her age, but Piper was determined.The teenager had been working at a backpacker's hostel for the past six weeks, and told friends she was going for a 05:00 morning swim on Monday, Australian media reported.Her body was found around 06:30 local time (20:30 GMT on Sunday).She was found near the Maheno shipwreck, which was washed ashore in 1935 and is now a popular tourist landmark.The area is known for its population of dingoes, a wild species of native dog that is protected in Queensland national parks.About 200 dingoes live on World Heritage-listed K'Gari, according to the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service.",

    "body": "5 hours agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology correspondent, San FranciscoTikTok's new US joint venture has made changes to its privacy policy that include expanding the type of location data the company can collect from its 200 million American users.The new policy was published after investors closed a deal with TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance on Thursday to run the popular short-form video app's business in the US.The new joint venture said in its updated privacy terms that it may now \"collect precise location data, depending on your settings\" -  a change from the previous policy which allowed for the collection of \"approximate\" location data.TikTok did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment on the change. The company policy added that the sensitive personal information would be processed \"in accordance with applicable law\" and that users can turn off location services in their device settings at any time.Even before the new venture was established, TikTok collected location information based on a user's SIM card or IP address, or both.But it stopped short of collecting even approximate GPS information from American users operating the most updated version of the app, according to a 2024 version of its privacy policy.Precise location sharing hasn't yet been enabled in the US, where it is expected to be optional and turned off by default so users will be asked to opt in with a pop-up message. TikTok has not said when the update is due to reach American users.TikTok already collects similar data from users in the UK and Europe as part of a new \"Nearby Feed\" feature that lets users find events and businesses near them.The new American TikTok joint venture is also extending its permissions for gathering information about users interactions with TikTok's artificial intelligence (AI) tools.This includes prompts and questions submitted by users, as well as information about how, when, and where AI content was prompted or created.TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC is comprised of three managing investors including cloud computing giant Oracle, which is investing heavily in AI infrastructure and has taken on significant debt to finance its ambitions in the burgeoning space.Oracle is chaired by Larry Ellison, a Republican megadonor and longtime ally of US President Donald Trump, whose administration helped broker the US TikTok deal.The agreement follows years of tussling between Washington and Beijing that began in Trump's first presidential term, when he tried unsuccessfully to ban the app over national security concerns.In 2024, the US passed a law that required the platform to be banned in the US by January 2025 if ByteDance failed to sell its US operations to American investors.Trump repeatedly postponed the enforcement of legislation until the joint venture was finalised this week.The 2024 law was prompted in part by concerns about the possibility that Beijing might access the data of TikTok's American users.In a statement onThursday, the new joint venture said its mandate was \"to secure U.S. user data, apps and the algorithm through comprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity measures\".Oracle will oversee the retraining of TikTok's powerful content recommendation algorithm on existing American user data, the joint venture said in its statement, adding that the algorithm \"will be secured in Oracle's U.S. cloud environment.\"ByteDance retains a minority stake just shy of 20% in the joint venture.Other managing investors include the US tech investment firm Silver Lake and Abu-Dhabi state-owned investment fund MGX, which has done business with the Trump family's crypto venture World Liberty Financial.On Friday, Republican Representative John Moolenaar, who chairs the House Select Committee on China, expressed concern about ByteDance's ongoing involvement in TikTok's US operations.\"Does this deal ensure China does not have influence over the algorithm? Can the parties involved assure Americans their data is secure?\" he said in a statement. \"Those are questions that need to be answered as the Select Committee does oversight of this deal.\"",

    "body": "Pentagon to offer 'more limited' support to US allies in defence strategy shift21 minutes agoClaire KeenanReutersHomeland security is the top priority in the Pentagon's new National Defense StrategyThe US will offer \"more limited\" support to its allies, according to the Pentagon's new National Defense Strategy.In a significant shift to its security priorities, the US Department of Defense now considers security of the US homeland and Western Hemisphere - not China - as its primary concern.By comparison, previous versions of the defence strategy -  published once every four years - named the \"multi-domain threat\" posed by China as the top defence priority for the US. The new strategy reinforces recent comments made by US President Donald Trump, including calls for greater \"burden-sharing\" from US allies in countering threats posed by Russia and North Korea.The new 34-page report follows last year's publication of the US National Security Strategy, which said Europe faced civilisational collapse and did not cast Russia as a threat to the US. At the time, Moscow said the document was \"largely consistent\" with its vision.By comparison, in 2018, the Pentagon described \"revisionist powers\", such as China and Russia, as the \"central challenge\" to US security.The new strategy calls on American allies to step up, saying partners have been \"content\" to let Washington subsidise their defence, although it denies the shift signals a US move towards \"isolationism\".\"To the contrary, it means a focused and genuinely strategic approach to the threats our nation faces,\" it says.Washington has long neglected the \"concrete interests\" of Americans, the report says, adding the US does not want to conflate American interests \"with those of the rest of the world – that a threat to a person halfway around the world is the same as to an American.\"Instead, it says allies, especially Europe, \"will take the lead against threats that are less severe for us but more so for them\". Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, is described as a \"persistent but manageable threat to NATO's eastern members\".Relations with China are to be approached through \"strength, not confrontation\", the report says.  The goal \"is not to dominate China; nor is it to strangle or humiliate them\".Unlike in previous versions of the strategy, Taiwan, the self-governing island claimed by China, is not mentioned. However, the document does write that the US aims to \"prevent anyone, including China, from being able to dominate us or our allies\".Late last year, the US announced a vast arms sale to Taiwan worth $11bn (£8.2bn), leading China to hold military drills around the island in response.The strategy also outlines a \"more limited\" role for US deterrence of North Korea. South Korea is \"capable of taking primary responsibility\" for the task, it adds. In the 12 months since Trump began his second term as president, the US has seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, carried out strikes against alleged drug boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, and more recently, applied pressure on US allies to acquire Greenland. The strategy reiterates that the Pentagon \"will guarantee US military and commercial access to key terrain, especially the Panama Canal, Gulf of America, and Greenland\".The document says the Trump administration's approach will be \"fundamentally different from the grandiose strategies of the past post–Cold War administrations\". It adds: \"Out with utopian idealism; in with hardnosed realism.\"At the World Economic Forum earlier this week, Trump claimed the US had \"never gotten anything\" from Nato and \"we've never asked for anything\".He further criticised the organisation, incorrectly claiming \"the United States was paying for virtually 100% of Nato\".Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the old world order is \"not coming back\" and urged fellow middle powers - like South Korea, Canada and Australia - to come together. \"Middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu,\" Carney said at the Davos meeting. That came as French President Emmanuel Macron also warned of a \"shift towards a world without rules\". ",

    "body": "13 hours agoFrank GardnerBBC Security CorrespondentPA MediaBlast walls, rocket attacks, Forward Operating Bases (FOBs), Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs)... and long queues in the canteen. Anyone who deployed to Afghanistan, in whatever role, between 2001-2021 will have their own vivid memories of that time. It started with the flight in – to Kandahar, Kabul or Camp Bastion. It could be a long, slow descent with the lights out on an RAF jet, or a rapid, corkscrew down in a C-130 transport plane. In both cases the aim was to avoid being blown out of the air by a Taliban surface-to-air missile.Over the course of 20 years thousands of servicemen and women, as well as civilians, from dozens of countries deployed to Afghanistan, answering the US call for assistance. That call came in the form of invoking Nato's Article 5 of its charter – the only time it has ever happened in Nato's 77-year history – which states that an attack on one member shall be deemed an attack on all.America was reeling from the devastating 9/11 attacks when al-Qaeda, which was being sheltered by the Taliban in Afghanistan, murdered nearly 3,000 people by flying packed airliners into New York's Twin Towers and the Pentagon in Washington.The Taliban were swiftly driven from power in a joint effort by the US military, the CIA and Afghanistan's Northern Alliance. Then it was all about trying to hunt down the remnants of al-Qaeda as Britain's Royal Marines, together with UK Special Forces, pursued them over the mountains but many escaped to safety to regroup in Pakistan. It was not until ten years later that the US Navy's Seal Team Six commandos tracked down the al-Qaeda leader, Osama Bin Laden, in a villa in Abbottabad, Pakistan.The first two years of the US-led \"Operation Enduring Freedom\" as it was called, were relatively quiet. By late 2003, as America's attention switched to Iraq, US servicemen we met even started referring to Afghanistan as \"Op Forgotten\". But it was still dangerous. From a rain-soaked Kandahar airbase we watched Romanian troops edge nervously out on patrol in their Soviet-era armoured vehicles, wary of the next ambush. Flying into a remote US-manned firebase in the mountainous Paktika province in a Blackhawk helicopter, my BBC crew and I were told cheerfully: \"You've come to the worst place in the world\". Sure enough, the Taliban launched Chinese-made rockets at the base after dark, planted there, we were told, by farmers who had been either bribed or coerced into doing so.Everything changed after 2006, when the UK deployed in force to Helmand province, a part of Afghanistan that had been relatively peaceful until then. The Taliban made their intentions clear. If you come, they said, then we will fight you. And yet the UK government at the time appeared shocked at the ferocity of the fighting 3 Para now found themselves engaged in, with British paratroopers calling in mortar and artillery fire so close to their positions it was termed \"danger close\", in an effort to stop their bases from being overrun.Over the next eight years, until the end of combat operations in 2014, it was not just Americans who were risking life and limb to serve in Afghanistan. Brits, Canadians, Danes and Estonians were among those who saw the toughest fighting in Kandahar and Helmand provinces. It would also be churlish to ignore the bravery and sacrifice of so many Afghans who fought and died over two decades.I say \"fighting\" but most soldiers' biggest fears stemmed from the hidden IEDs, those expertly concealed Improvised Explosive Devices. The Taliban, who of course knew every inch of their terrain, were often able to guess correctly exactly where troops would need to cross an irrigation ditch or canal and so place the bomb accordingly. In the space of a split second, in a blinding flash and puff of black smoke, a fit, healthy, 20-something individual would have their life either ended or catastrophically changed, facing amputation and a host of other complications. So prevalent were these IEDs that soldiers were going out of the gates of their FOBs - Forward Operating Bases - on patrol praying that if they got hit it would result in a below-the-knee amputation, not one above the knee.The courage and resilience of the people I have met since, who have managed, despite terrible loss and adversity, to turn their shattered lives around, is both humbling and awe-inspiring. These are just some of the people who answered America's call for help after the 9/11 attacks. It is little wonder there has been such nationwide outrage at that country's president's suggestion that they somehow dodged the fighting.",

    "body": "Alleged drug kingpin and ex-Olympian Ryan Wedding arrested after years on the run10 hours agoAna FaguyandMax MatzaWatch: Ryan Wedding escorted by police in handcuffs after arrestFormer Canadian Olympic snowboarder and alleged drug kingpin Ryan Wedding has been arrested in Mexico and will be extradited to the US after years on the run, FBI Director Kash Patel has said.Wedding, who had been on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, is accused of running a transnational drug trafficking operation that moved tonnes of cocaine across international borders.Wedding, 44, was also wanted on murder charges. US officials had said they believed Wedding was living in Mexico under the Sinaloa drug cartel's protection.The head of Canada's federal police force, which assisted in the investigation, spoke alongside Patel on Friday to praise the law enforcement operation.\"No single agency or nation can combat transnational organised crime alone,\" said Mike Duheme, Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). \"We can finally say that our communities, our countries, are much safer with the arrest of Ryan Wedding,\" he added.Wedding is expected to make his first court appearance in Los Angeles on Monday.FBIWedding, seen in an undated photo released by the FBIWedding is accused of running a vast drug trafficking operation responsible for importing some 60 metric tonnes of cocaine a year.The organisation operated across North America, as well as several countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, and was also the largest supplier of cocaine to Canada, bringing in an estimated $1bn a year. Before he was arrested, Wedding was accused of killing a federal witness in a case against him. Officials say he has also ordered the murders of several others.Wedding is now facing a slew of felony charges, including witness tampering and intimidation, murder, money laundering and drug trafficking.The FBI had previously placed a $15m (£11m) reward for information leading to his arrest. Patel declined to comment on whether anyone would be claiming the reward money.US officials have released limited details regarding how Wedding was captured, except to say that his arrest took place on Thursday night in Mexico City. Mexico's top security official, Omar García Harfuch, said in a post on X that Patel had visited Mexico City on Thursday, and departed with two fugitives on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list. He did not name the men arrested, but said one was a \"Canadian citizen who voluntarily surrendered\" at the US embassy in Mexico. Watch: FBI director calls Ryan Wedding \"a modern day Pablo Escobar\"The Associated Press, citing an unnamed Mexican Security Cabinet member,  reported that Wedding is the Canadian who turned himself in at the US embassy. In his remarks at a news conference, Patel described Wedding as a \"modern-day Pablo Escobar\", referring to the Colombian cartel leader. US officials have also compared him to Mexican drug dealer Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán.\"When you go after a guy like Ryan Wedding, it takes a united front,\" Patel said, thanking Canadian and Mexican authorities for their help in the investigation.Patel also thanked the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, who participated in taking Wedding into custody.In an interview with Vanity Fair, Patel praised the team, which had also been involved in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro weeks earlier.\"This was a complex, high-stakes operation with zero margin for error,\" Patel told the magazine. \"I was on the ground with our team in Mexico and witnessed extraordinary teamwork, precision, and trust between our agents and partners in Mexico.\"Wedding's aliases include \"El Jefe,\" \"Giant,\" \"Public Enemy,\" \"James Conrad King,\" and \"Jesse King\", the FBI said. He has reportedly had plastic surgery to change his appearance while on the run.Officials allege that he launched his criminal enterprise following his release from a US federal prison in 2011, where he was serving a sentence for cocaine distribution.Authorities allege he has ordered dozens of murders across the globe, including in the US, Canada and Latin America.Getty ImagesThe FBI had offered a $15m reward for Ryan WeddingOfficials say he had been living in luxury in Mexico. In December, Mexican authorities announced that they had seized $40m in racing motorcycles owned by Wedding. They also seized other valuable items, including luxury paintings, artworks, drugs and two Olympic gold medals.It is unclear to whom the medals belong. Wedding competed for Canada in the 2002 Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, but did not win any medals. He came in 24th place in the men's giant parallel slalom ski event.In November, the FBI seized his rare 2002 Mercedes CLK-GTR, which had been valued at $13m.Patel also spoke about the recent arrest of another man in Mexico who had been on the FBI's most wanted list. American man Alejandro Castillo was wanted for the murder of his ex-girlfriend. According to the FBI, he has been in hiding in Mexico for nearly 10 years, and will now be extradited back to North Carolina for trial. ",

    "body": "Mandela's prison key, sunglasses and shirt can be sold after daughter wins court battleA South African court has dismissed an appeal by the country's heritage body to stop the sale and export of various artefacts connected to anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela.The 70 personal items include a cell key from Robben Island, where Mandela was imprisoned for 18 of the 27 years he was locked up, a pair of Aviator sunglasses and one of his signature floral shirts. They were due to be exported to the US for auction.The objects belong to his eldest daughter, Makaziwe Mandela and Christo Brand, a Robben Island warden during Mandela's incarceration. In trying to stop their sale, the authorities said they were part of the country's heritage and were therefore legally protected from export.The South African Heritage Resources Agency (Sahra) first found out about the potential sale in a British newspaper article from late 2021, claiming that the key would go for more than £1m ($1.35m).The agency then wrote to the US auction house, Guernsey, that was planning the sale to ask it to suspend the auction and return the assets to South Africa.Other items in the lot were a copy of the 1996 South African Constitution personally signed by Mandela, one of his charcoal drawings, an ID card, a tennis racquet he used on Robben Island and gifts from world leaders, including one from former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle.Mandela's daughter wanted to use the proceeds from the sale to build a memorial garden at the late former president's grave in Qunu, in Mthatha, Eastern Cape province.In its ruling, the Supreme Court of Appeal argued that Sahra's interpretation of what items fell under the National Heritage Resources Act was overly broad.The ruling also states that whereas Makaziwe and Brand explained in detail why their respective assets were not heritage objects, Sahra made no attempt to explain on what grounds it believed they were.It is not yet clear whether the authorities will seek other legal avenues to block the sale. The BBC has contacted the sport, arts and culture department for comment.Makaziwe, Mandela's only daughter with his first wife, welcomed the Supreme Court's judgment, blasting the heritage agency for presuming \"to know my father's last wishes better than those who were beside him at the end - his family\".\"Nobody is more invested in ensuring Tata's [Mandela's] legacy endures in the way he would want to be remembered than those who carry his name,\" she said.She added that no decision had yet been made on what would happen to the items meant to go on auction.Some supporters of the government's position argued that items connected to Mandela should not be sold or exported but instead kept in South Africa for future generations.Others believe that Mandela's family should decide what happens to the objects.Mandela died in 2013 at the age of 95. He led the African National Congress in its struggle against apartheid - a system of legally enforced racism - and was released from prison in 1990.He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 along with then-President FW de Klerk.Mandela became South Africa's first democratically elected president in 1994.",

    "body": "11 hours agoSarah RainsfordEastern Europe correspondent , KyivReutersThis was the first time the three delegations have met in the same room together.Negotiators from Russia, Ukraine and the US have been meeting in Abu Dhabi for their first trilateral talks since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.But whilst the talks take a new format, the core differences remain the same.The stakes are high, but expectations are limited.Donald Trump is pushing hard for a peace deal in Ukraine – the one he promised but hasn't yet delivered – and he said this week that the two sides would be \"stupid\" if they couldn't agree.But despite some intense shuttle diplomacy by his own envoys, they are hosting the first trilateral talks involving Ukrainian and Russian negotiators with some major issues still unresolved.Ukraine is engaging with the process because it wants peace more than anyone, but also because it needs to keep the US onside. It learned that lesson the hard way last year, when Donald Trump briefly suspended intelligence sharing and military aid.Getty ImagesUkraine wants peace more than anyone in this processNow, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says his talks with Trump in Davos were \"really positive\" and he hopes for more air defence support against Russia's relentless attacks as a result.Often grim-faced after his encounters with the US leader, this time Zelensky seemed unusually upbeat.But he remains cautious on the outcome of talks in the United Arab Emirates.He's described the meetings, which may last two days, as \"a step\", but shied away from calling it a positive one.\"We have to wish it will push us a bit closer to peace,\" is how he put it.For a while, Zelensky has talked about being 90% of the way to producing a framework deal for peace, but the final 10% was always going to be the hardest - and Russia could still reject the whole thing.\"It's all about the eastern part of our country. It's all about the land. This is the issue that's not resolved yet,\" he explained, spelling out the biggest obstacle that he says still remains.Russia insists that Ukraine should hand over the big slice of the eastern Donbas region, which it has failed to win on the battlefield. Ukraine refuses.Politicians often talk about their red lines, but for this country the line in the Donbas is drawn with the blood of the soldiers who died defending it.Zelensky can't cross it.As I write this, the music from another soldier's funeral is drifting up from a church in the street.On my way back into Ukraine this time, we drove past so many military graves in roadside cemeteries, all marked with flags.The other big issue up for discussion in the UAE is what the US would do, militarily, if Russia were to invade Ukraine again someday. That's what Ukraine calls its \"security guarantees\", and says are essential.Zelensky says the deal between the US and Ukraine is done, but we have no real details.Russia's response also remains a wide-open question.There's also the giant new doubt about how good a guarantee from Donald Trump really is: the US president's fixation on \"acquiring\" Greenland has severely undermined Nato.He's also undermined the very principle of protecting a nation's sovereignty, the whole basis for Western support for Ukraine.So can Kyiv trust him to come to the rescue in the next crisis? For now, it doesn't have much choice.As for trusting Vladimir Putin, no one here is under any illusions that his aims have changed.\"He really doesn't want it,\" is what Zelensky said in Davos about Putin and peace.The Kremlin has said that if it doesn't get what it wants at the talking table, it will \"achieve its aims on the battlefield\" - though it's failed so far, despite sacrificing a huge number of soldiers.So once again, it's targeting civilian infrastructure across the country - but in a more deliberate, sustained, and devastating way than ever before.In the depths of a bitter winter, that's left people freezing in their homes.Today, the mayor of Kyiv again called on city residents to leave if they have somewhere to go.\"The enemy will most likely continue to attack the critical infrastructure of the city and the country,\" Vitali Klitschko warned.After repeat attacks, the system is very fragile.\"I address the residents and say honestly: the situation is extremely difficult and this may not be the most difficult moment yet.\"",

    "body": "Danish PM in Greenland for 'show of support' after Trump threats4 hours agoAdrienne MurrayCopenhagenReutersFrederiksen (left) said there was now a \"diplomatic, political track\" to pursue after a difficult weekDanish PM Mette Frederiksen is visiting Greenland's capital Nuuk for talks with the territory's leader, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, after a rollercoaster week that saw US President Donald Trump roll back his threats to forcibly take over the Arctic island and agree to further negotiations.Tensions had risen precariously over the past couple of weeks, until a stunning turnaround on Wednesday, when Trump suddenly ruled out military action, and withdrew his threats to slap tariffs on several European allies.Trump posted on social media that a \"framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland\" had been reached, following his meeting with Nato chief Mark Rutte at the World Economic Forum in Davos.However, few details have been given, and there are questions about what exactly was agreed between the US president and the secretary general.The Danish prime minister travelled directly from Brussels, where she also met face-to-face with Rutte earlier on Friday morning. According to Rutte's post on X, they agreed \"to enhance deterrence and defence in the Arctic\".After landing at Nuuk airport, Frederiksen was greeted on the tarmac by Nielsen, who gave her a hug.\"I am first and foremost in Greenland today to show our strong Danish support for the Greenlandic people,\" she told reporters. \"It's a very difficult time, everyone can see that.\"\"It is a serious situation we are in. Everyone can see that. Now there is a diplomatic, political track that we will pursue,\" she said. Her trip was a \"working\" visit to prepare their \"next steps,\" she said.On Thursday, Trump told Fox News that the US \"gets everything we want at no cost\" and that a \"piece\" of his planned \"Golden Dome\" missile defence system would be placed on Greenland.When asked if this was an actual \"acquisition\", he answered: \"It's total access. There's no end, there's no time limit.\" Notably, Trump did not mention American ownership of Greenland.For former Danish foreign minister, Martin Lidegaard, that's a sign of positivity. \"I hear a change in the language from the President,\" he said. \"He does not necessarily think he has to own [Greenland].\"\"I'm a bit more optimistic than I have been for quite a long time, where we saw only escalation after escalation after escalation,\" says Lidegaard, who's also known for inspiring the latest series of Borgen, a Danish political drama, which features a plotline about a power struggle over Greenland.But despite Trump's climbdown, Greenlandic MP Aaja Chemnitz told the BBC it will take much more to rebuild the trust of her compatriots. \"I think it's too early to lower our shoulder… Many people are confused and concerned.\"Earlier Trump had also told CNBC that an \"ultimate long-term deal\" over Greenland \"pertains to security and minerals, and everything else\".Chemnitz is sceptical. \"Minerals haven't been discussed with Nato. Why should they do that? This is completely up to Greenland,\" she said, which has legal authority over its own land and resources.Likewise, Per Stig Moeller, another former Danish Foreign Minister, remains cautious.He said the situation is \"still very delicate\" and \"might change tomorrow\", pointing to recent meetings in Washington, and the White House's diverging interpretation of what had been agreed.\"That's why it's very important that we insist, it all happens inside NATO,\" he suggests.Previously the New York Times reported that one idea under discussion was Denmark ceding sovereignty over small pockets of land where the US would build military bases.However Danish and Greenlandic officials have pushed back strongly against giving up any sovereignty, making clear that it is a \"red line\".Frederiksen has said it was non-negotiable, although Denmark was willing to work on \"security\".Trump has argued that taking control over Greenland is necessary for the security of the United States, pointing to a growing presence of China and Russia in the Arctic.In response Denmark and its European allies have sought to reassure the US that they'll boost Arctic security, while calling for a more substantive Nato presence.Ahead of an emergency European summit in the Belgian capital on Thursday evening, Frederiksen said that Greenland's sovereignty was non-negotiable, though Denmark was willing to work on \"security\".ReutersFrederiksen (centre-left in light-brown) has described Greenland's sovereignty as a \"red line\"The US has around 150 military personnel at its single Pituffik base in the north-western tip of the territory.Under a defence pact with Denmark, dating back to 1951, the US can already build up its military presence and deploy further troops.\"They withdrew bases. They withdrew soldiers,\" says Per Stig Moeller. \"Did we throw them out? No, we did not. They went themselves.\"That was updated in 2004, jointly with the Bush administration, to include Greenland as an equal partner to the deal.\"We signed it together,\" says Moeller, who was Denmark's foreign secretary at the time. \"It's the real working treaty today.\"\"[The US] can make important changes to their military, to bases in Greenland. They just have to inform us or confer with us,\" he adds.AFP has reported that sources familiar with talks had said the US and Denmark would renegotiate the 1951 agreement.Danish national newspaper Berlingske also writes that a renegotiation is possible, that the Danish and Greenlandic sides have not ruled out revising that deal. However, mineral rights or the surrender of territory have never been on the table.The BBC has reached out to Denmark's Ministry of Defence, which declined to comment.Whatever is negotiated, Aaja Chemnitz says it could be an uphill battle for the United States to win Greenlandic hearts and minds.\"When Trump's talking about a 'big chunk of ice' that he wants,\" she says, referring to the US president's speech in Davos, \"this is very, very disrespectful towards the people of Greenland\".\"I think it will be much more difficult for the US to make an agreement,\" she adds. \"The people of Greenland are really pushing away from the US, after everything that has happened this last year.\"Meanwhile Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on Friday there had been no detailed plan, but that negotiations would start soon, focusing on \"security, security, and security\".",

    "body": "1 day agoSuranjana TewariAsia Business Correspondent, SingaporeGetty ImagesOne in seven people in the world use TikTok. Yet for the company behind such a cultural phenomenon, the last few years have been a rollercoaster.Concerns over the app first surfaced more than five years ago, prompting President Trump, in his first term, to sign an executive order aimed at removing TikTok from US stores.Lawmakers were worried that the Chinese government could access user data of the 200 million Americans who use the app and possibly manipulate their feeds.To address these concerns, TikTok's parent company ByteDance launched Project Texas – storing US user data on domestic servers run by American-owned Oracle. The company also moved its headquarters to Singapore and Los Angeles – in part to distance itself from its Chinese roots.These were seen as significant concessions at the time. But still, in 2024 Congress passed a law threatening to ban the app outright, unless ByteDance transferred majority ownership and changed how TikTok operates in the US.That deal has now closed with ByteDance signing an agreement to split the US app from the rest of its global business under a new consortium of companies that includes Oracle.TikTok remains alive in a critical market, but the terms underline the compromises and limits that ByteDance - and perhaps other Chinese tech firms - may face as they try to expand globally.How did we get here?The US-China rivalry has seen Washington and Beijing crack down on each other's firms over national security concerns.Yet in the the most recent trade war TikTok became \"low hanging fruit\" that China could offer in exchange for other important concessions, like American agricultural products.The deal allows China to frame the outcome as a win - exporting tech on its own terms while gaining leverage in broader trade negotiations.ByteDance will retain access to America's 200 million users and 7.5 million businesses, but it loses control over TikTok's algorithm and data.Instead, the company will licence the algorithm to the new US entity, in a deal the Trump administration has valued at $14bn (£10bn).\"TikTok's power lies in its content graph - an algorithm that learns from thousands of user signals to deliver hyper‑relevant, highly addictive videos,\" said Kelsey Chickering, principal analyst at Forrester.\"With a US joint venture retraining that algorithm on domestic data, the experience will change... One thing's certain: TikTok in America won't be the same.\"This shift could have knock on effects for advertisers and creators because of the changes. Creators may see their engagement shrink especially because global virality will take a hit – previously content that took off in one region could become popular in the US organically. A US-only algorithm could weaken that, forcing brands to re-structure deals and perhaps having to pay more for US exposure.TikTok's global revenue was estimated to be $20-26bn in 2024, roughly $10 billion of which came from the US with advertising accounting for a large share.The changes will likely hurt TikTok's bottom line in the US, but ByteDance retains a 19.9% stake and therefore a share of the profits.The retraining of the algorithm might also have consequences for ByteDance's technology development.Running separate US and global algorithms, split workforces, and parallel governance adds engineering costs, slows innovation, and adds to the operational complexity, says Charlie Dai Principal Analyst in Technology Architecture & Delivery at Forrester.The India experienceByteDance has faced political and regulatory hurdles before.The loss of India in 2020 - then TikTok's largest market, with 200 million users - was a far bigger setback than any potential disruption in the US, says Chris Stokel-Walker, author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World's Favourite App.But, he says, even the India \"setback\" wasn't much of a setback. \"They've continued to show growth despite these challenges.\"The struggles in both the US and India share a common thread: they were triggered by geopolitical tensions.The India ban, however, was not aimed at TikTok alone - it targeted China more broadly, with roughly 200 apps blocked across the country. And while that ban opened the door for homegrown platforms to emerge, none have come close to matching TikTok's success.Getty ImagesTikTok CEO Shou Chew will be a director in the new US ventureFor some, the TikTok deal inevitably invites comparisons with Huawei – another Chinese tech champion whose global ambitions have been reshaped by geopolitics.But there are stark differences, Huawei has been effectively locked out of Western markets after US sanctions cut off access to critical 5G infrastructure.TikTok by contrast has been allowed to remain, albeit on restrictive terms for ByteDance.Chris Stokel-Walker says this reflects a shift in how governments are responding to Chinese technology companies.Some are excluded altogether; others are permitted to operate, but only within tightly defined political and regulatory limits.A homegrown championWhile TikTok is being reshaped abroad, it has full control over Douyin – its Chinese sister app – which is hugely successful in its own right within China.Douyin forms a core pillar of ByteDance's business – it is profitable, politically aligned and able to innovate because it is in charge of training the algorithm on data it has full access to.But ByteDance is also hedging its bets for the future, investing in data centres, the cloud and Artificial Intelligence, underscoring the company's efforts to diversify beyond advertising-led consumer apps.Chris Stokel-Walker argues that TikTok's predicament is no longer really about data security, but about who controls speech, culture and influence in the US.Trump has never liked that China might be shaping American culture, he says.The reality is that ByteDance will continue to operate TikTok in the US, but with distinct limitations. And this could spill over into other markets it plans to expand in with regulators looking for more control over Chinese technology.Other experts have said the licensing aspect of the deal could form a template for how other Chinese tech companies expand globally in an environment of increasing mistrust of Beijing.",

    "body": "5 hours agoAlicia CurryGrace Eliza GoodwinWatch: Empty shelves and road preparations as US readies for winter stormMore than 200 million Americans are expected to face an unusually brutal winter storm starting Friday, with heavy snows and freezing rains forecast.The storm is expected to sweep through much of the United States, leaving \"extremely dangerous\" conditions in its wake as it tracks eastwards from the High Plains and Rockies, the National Weather Service (NWS) said.It warned that the Arctic blast will bring sub-zero temperatures and wind chills, which \"pose a life-threatening risk of hypothermia and frostbite to exposed skin\".US transportation officials, including airport authorities in several major cities, have warned of weekend travel disruption, delays and cancellations.What is the storm's predicted path? The winter storm is forecast to move slowly across the US, blanketing cities including Memphis, Nashville, Washington DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York with snow.Heavy snow is predicted through the Southern Rockies and Plains, into the Mid-Atlantic and reaching the Northeast.According to the NWS Probabilistic Precipitation Portal, the regions that could see more than a foot of snow stretch from Colorado to West Virginia to Boston.Watch: Major US storm expected to disrupt travel and bring sub-zero temperaturesParts of northeast New Jersey and southeast New York, including New York City, could see between 10 and 14 inches of snow starting early on Sunday and lasting through Monday, the NWS predicts. And windchills as low as -10F (-23C) are expected for the same region from Friday evening to Saturday afternoon, the service says. Most of southern New England, including Boston, can expect between 12 and 17 inches of snow and wind gusts up to 30mph from Sunday into Monday, NWS says. Wind chill temperatures there could reach -15F (-26C) Friday into Saturday. Numerous low temperature records are likely to be broken, according to the NWS, with the coldest wind chills potentially falling below -50F (-46C) across the Northern Plains. A much wider area of the south-eastern US is also forecast to experience freezing temperatures.Parts of North Texas were already seeing sleet and ice on Friday night.How are states preparing for the storm?Governors in several US states, including Arkansas, Georgia, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina, have declared states of emergency, allowing emergency officials - including National Guard troops - to begin mobilising response efforts.In a press conference on Friday, New York Governor Kathy Hochul said the state has over 1,600 snow plows and 114,000 tonnes of salt on hand for the storm, which she said will leave no corner of the state \"immune from feeling the effect of Mother Nature's wrath\".Hochul urged residents to work from home, stock up on groceries and essentials ahead of time and be careful when shoveling snow, which can increase the risk of a heart attack. New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani said Friday the city will be deploying thousands of sanitation workers this weekend, 700 salt spreaders and 2,200 snow plows once two inches of snow have accumulated. While subways and buses will be operational this weekend, he urged New Yorkers to stay home if they can. Texas Governor Greg Abbott said Thursday there's \"no expectation whatsoever\" that the state's power grid will fail, as it did during a major storm in 2021 which led to hundreds of deaths in the state. AFP via Getty ImagesThe disruption from heavy snowfall could cause widespread power outages and travel disruptionThere may be some local power outages due to falling ice and snow, he said, but stressed that this would be different from a large-scale grid failure. \"The local power providers have never been more prepared for any winter storm ever,\" Abbott said. In total, 16 states were under a state of emergency on Friday ahead of the storm. Some airlines have offered passengers the option to change their flights, in some cases without incurring extra fees, due to concerns about cancellations.More than 3,200 flights within, into or out of the US have already been cancelled for Saturday, as well as over 4,800 for Sunday, according to flight tracker FlightAware. Motorists should avoid driving across the weekend, with travel expected to be \"nearly impossible during the peak of the storm\", NWS meteorologists Rich Otto and Tony Fracasso told the BBC's US news partner CBS.Meanwhile in Canada, freezing temperatures are already gripping the country, with snowfall expected in eastern and Atlantic regions on Monday, meteorologist Geoff Coulson told CBC earlier in the week.Even after the storm passes through the US this weekend, a strong arctic air mass originating in Canada will keep temperatures frigid in the eastern US into next week, according to the NWS Weather Prediction Center.
